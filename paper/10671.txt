Large Blocks of Stock: Prevalence, Size, and Measurement

NBER Working Paper No. 10671
August 2004
JEL No. G3
ABSTRACT
Large blocks of stock play an important role in many studies of corporate governance and finance.
Despite this important role, there is no standardized data set for these blocks, and the best available
data source, Compact Disclosure, has many mistakes and biases. In this paper, we document these
mistakes and show how to fix them. The mistakes and bias tend to increase with the level of reported
blockholdings: in firms where Compact Disclosure reports that aggregate blockholdings are greater
than 50 percent, these aggregate holdings are incorrect more than half the time and average holdings
for these incorrect firms are overstated by almost 30 percentage points. We also demonstrate that
our fixes are economically and statistically significant in an analysis of the relationship between firm
value and outside blockholders.

I. Introduction
Large-block shareholders play an important role in corporate governance. For this
reason, the presence of such “blockholders” and the size of their holdings is a common
explanatory variable in financial research. In just the last few years, a representative sample
of such studies includes analyses of the role of blockholders in executive turnover, executive
compensation, firm diversification, discretionary expenses, market liquidity, and corporate
performance.1

Furthermore, blockholder data is a crucial input in the analysis of the

relationship between ownership structure and firm value, where seminal works by Demsetz
and Lehn (1985) and Morck et al. (1988) gave rise to a vast and growing literature.
Despite the common use of large shareholder data, there does not exist a clean offthe-shelf database to facilitate research. Many of the papers cited above required their
authors to gather their own data. This time-consuming task is necessary because of several
weaknesses in the available databases.

Of course, decentralized data gathering causes

duplication of effort and lack of standardization across projects. Also, because of the large
time commitment necessary to clean the data for each firm, most researchers have gathered
data for a relatively small number of firms. This paper aims to fill this data gap by
documenting the problems with the currently available data, proposing a consistent set of
solutions to these problems, and making a “clean” database freely available to all
researchers.2 Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of clean (vs. raw) data with a
representative study on the relationship between outside blockholders and firm value.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (SEA) lays out the ownership disclosure
requirements for public corporations in Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A.

Virtually

everything we know about blockholders in the United States comes from these disclosure
requirements, which are described in detail in Appendix A of this paper. The two main types
of data produced by the SEA are for holdings (once per year, reported in the annual proxy
statement), and for transactions by corporate insiders and beneficial owners (updated through
Forms 3, 4 and 5). While the trading data would appear to provide the most current and
comprehensive information, past research has demonstrated that this data is difficult to work
with and cannot be relied upon to infer the holdings of individual blockholders (Anderson
and Lee (1997a and 1997b), Jeng et al. (2003)). Thus, we focus in this paper on the annual
proxy data, which is more reliable and more commonly used by researchers.
Proxy data is available from many sources, including direct electronic access using
the SEC’s “Edgar” tool for all corporate filings since the mid-1990s. For large-scale data
downloads, however, it is necessary to use a commercial product. The most widely used
product is the Compact Disclosure database of Standard & Poor’s. Anderson and Lee (1997a
and 1997b) focus their analysis on the holdings of corporate officers and directors, and show
that Compact Disclosure accurately reproduces the information in proxy statements for all
firms except those with multiple classes of stock.

While Compact Disclosure also

reproduces data on blockholders from the tables in the proxy statement, there are additional
problems with these data. We discuss these problems and their solutions in Section II, and
summarize the changes for a large sample of firms from 1996 to 2001.
In Section III, we perform a representative study using both raw Compact Disclosure
data and a “clean” data set where these problems have been fixed.

We find that the raw

4

data is much noisier: in annual regressions of Tobin’s Q on outside blockholder ownership
and other control variables, the clean data set is far more likely to yield statistically
significant point estimates for the ownership variables.

Section IV summarizes our

conclusions. Two appendices supplement the text. Appendix A provides details on the 1934
SEA and the disclosure requirements it created, and Appendix B provides details on the
construction of our sample.

II.

Data
A. Sample Firms
Our initial sample of firms consists of firms that are covered by the Investor

Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) for both their publication Corporate Takeover
Defenses (Rosenbaum 1995, 1998, 2000) and their director’s database which provides details
on the board of directors for about 1,500 of the largest U.S. companies. The IRRC’s universe
is drawn from the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 as well as the annual lists of the largest
corporations in the publications of Fortune, Forbes, and Businessweek. We use the IRRC
sample as a starting point because a wide range of governance data is available for this group
of companies and our goal is to make this set of data as comprehensive as possible for this
group.3 A special subset of the IRRC companies – less than 10 percent in all years – have
multiple classes of common stock. For these companies, Anderson and Lee (1997a) showed
there are many problems with the Compact Disclosure data, and these problems are very
difficult to fix. In this paper, we eliminate all multiple-class companies from the database and

The IRRC data has been used as a starting point by Gompers et al. (2003), Cremers and Nair (2004), and
Gillan et al. (2003).

5

start with the approximately 1300 firms per year (7,873 firm-years) for the single-classed
companies in the IRRC sample from 1996 to 2001.4
The initial ownership data comes from the Compact Disclosure CD-ROMs. Based on
the results of Anderson and Lee (1997a, 1997b) we build our sample from the information on
large shareholders that Compact Disclosure derives directly from the proxies and ignore the
insider-trading data that is also available through Compact Disclosure. Appendix B provides
details on the construction of the initial database.
We next check the initial database by comparing the Compact Disclosure data to the
original proxy statements, which we obtain from Livedgar,5 making changes to the
ownership percentages of large shareholders where appropriate. All firms in the sample were
checked – even those with no reported blockholders in Compact Disclosure. We employ the
following general rules when deciding on share ownership. The SEC defines beneficial
ownership as either voting or investment power, and sometimes companies report both
measures in their proxies. We use voting power as opposed to investment power for our
database when a distinction is made between the two. Also, even if individuals disclaim
beneficial ownership of some portion of their holdings in the proxy, we treat these holdings
as if the individual had the voting power. Under the terms of SEC Rule 13d-3, shares of
common stock that may be acquired within 60 days are deemed outstanding for the purposes
of computing the percentage of common stock owned by a shareholder. We follow this SEC
rule and include these options. In the rare cases of a company having a temporary ownership
structure resulting from a recent merger or acquisition, we remove these companies from our
4

The dual-class companies are analyzed in a companion paper, Gompers et al. (2004), where we attempt to
build a comprehensive sample of all dual-class companies with any share-class trading on any major exchange
in the United States.

sample for that year. For 229 (2.9%) sample firms, proxy information could not be obtained,
and these firm-years were removed from our sample. Our final sample consists thus of 7,649
firm-years and covers 1,913 unique firms. Table 1 shows summary statistics of our sample
firms. The table is based on cross-sectional averages of time-series means.
Many researchers are interested in knowing whether a specific blockholder is an
“insider” or an “outsider” to the firm. The role of large shareholders in corporate governance
is often treated differently depending on the classification of the shareholder. Since our work
required the examination of all blockholders, the marginal cost of coding these classifications
was relatively low, so we did so. The results are summarized in Table 2. The possible
classifications are (1) officer, (2) director, (3) affiliated entity, (4) ESOP, and (5) outside
blockholder. Category (1) includes all officers, even if they are also directors. Category (2)
only includes non-officer directors. Category (3) includes any individual, trust, or company
whose voting outcome is partially influenced, but not completely controlled, by an officer or
director of the company. If the shares are completely controlled by the officer or director,
then these shares would be counted under category (1) or (2), respectively. Category (4) is
the aggregate number shares held by Employee Share Ownership Plans, but does not include
employee shares held through non-ESOP retirement plans (such as non-ESOP 401(k) plans).
Category (5) includes all blockholders not elsewhere classified. This final category makes up
about two-thirds of the aggregate amount of blockholding, and will be examined in the
analysis of Section III.

7

B. Problems with the Compact Disclosure Data
Two main biases are introduced if researchers were to work directly with the
benchmark Compact Disclosure database: overlaps and preferred shares. The SEC requires
that all beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company’s common stock be listed in the
proxy, and consequently shares are often double or triple counted under different people or
entities.6 While the SEC requires firms to detail the ownership structure of jointly held block
in the footnotes, Compact Disclosure ignores all of the footnotes detailing joint or cross
ownership of shares and lists every blockholder and ownership percentage exactly as it
appears in the summary table of the proxy section “Security Ownership of Management and
Certain Beneficial Owners.” This leads to the overlap of reported ownership, which might be
either a full overlap or a partial overlap. Examples of these two cases are documented below
in Subsection 1. Second, Compact Disclosure sometimes misrepresents preferred shares as
common equity ownership. This problem is illustrated below in Subsection 2.

1. Overlaps
Full overlaps can arise in two types of situations. In the first scenario, two or more
blockholders are listed in the ownership table with the same shareholdings and the joint
ownership of these shares is disclosed only by the footnotes. In the second scenario, the
proxy separates the beneficial ownership of directors and officers from that of large
shareholders and Compact Disclosure reproduces entries from both tables without crosschecking identities. Figures 1 and 2 display an example of the latter case. Figure 1 shows the
Compact Disclosure data for Coca Cola Co. from the October 1999 CD, and Figure 2 shows
an excerpt of the proxy statement from March 4th, 1999 on which the data is based. While
6

See Appendix A for details of these disclosure requirements.

8

Compact Disclosure’s blockholder data is accurate in a literal sense with respect to the two
tables in the proxy, the vital information of the proxy footnote is ignored. Figure 1 lists
Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett individually as 8.10% owners of the common stock.
Referring to the footnote 4 of Figure 1 (the ownership table from the proxy statement), we
find that all of the shares listed under Warren Buffett are owned indirectly through Berkshire
Hathaway. Tallying the beneficial ownership percentages without referencing the table
footnotes in the proxy would suggest that 22.3% of Coca Cola’s common stock is held by
blockholders when actually 14.2% is the correct figure.
Overlaps are not always easy to recognize. In the second and more common scenario,
multiple blockholders have joint-ownership of stock but also own shares over which they
have sole voting or investment power. This type of overlap does not result in identical
ownership figures for multiple shareholders. For example, there is no obvious overlap in the
Compact Disclosure listing for Outback Steakhouse, Inc. (Figure 3). However, footnotes 1, 2
and 4 to the proxy beneficial ownership table (Figure 4) reveal that 8,242,125 shares
(16.85%) owned by Multi-Venture Partners, Ltd. are also listed under Chris T. Sullivan,
Robert D. Basham, and J. Timothy Gannon. This means that beneficial owners hold 26.98%
of the common stock, rather than 77.53%, which is the straightforward sum of Compact
Disclosure’s ownership statistics. Note that the Spectrum data does not report the 5%
blockholders correctly. At the bottom of Figure 3, where the Spectrum data is listed after the
delimiter ‘***^’, it is stated that there are five 5% owners who hold an aggregate of 62.06%
of common stock.
Both of the above examples are relatively easy to spot and correct. However, many
companies have more complex overlaps which translate into more detailed footnotes and

9

longer amounts of time that a researcher must spend examining them.

These types of

overlaps include those among companies, subsidiaries, individuals, and trusts. When the
information in the footnotes is insufficient to determine the ultimate control of these shares,
we follow the rule of assigning these shares to the partial owner who is closest to control of
the company: officers first, then directors, and then outsiders.

2) Preferred Stock
There are two ways in which preferred shares can erroneously enter into the
beneficial ownership figures. A company may report ownership of common stock and
preferred stock separately but side by side in the same proxy table. In this case, Compact
Disclosure will pick up all of the percentages in the table without distinguishing between the
two categories of stock, giving us two different ownership figures for shareholders holding
both preferred and common stock. Figure 5 shows one example from the original Compact
Disclosure database, and Figure 6 shows the corresponding proxy statement. Some
companies structure their proxy statements by listing common and preferred ownership side
by side, but also giving an aggregated ownership figure. In these cases, Compact Disclosure
tends to erroneously pick up just the aggregate ownership figure, without doing any
adjustment for the relative voting power between the common and preferred.

In our

corrected data, we include only the common-stock component of voting.

C. The Corrected Data
The first four rows of Table 3 show the frequency of the corrections we made by
groups of overall shares held by blockholders. Using a non-parametric Wilcoxon difference

10

test, we show that the corrected and raw percentages of rows three and four are statistically
different for all 6 groups of blockholders at the one percent level. The remainder of Table 3
shows the frequency of each of the problems. It is evident from Table 3 that the overlap
problem becomes more pronounced the higher is the overall share of common stock held by
blockholders.

For companies where the reported ownership in Compact Disclosure is

between five and ten percent, the frequency of errors is 0.4 percent. This error rate rises to
4.5 percent for the 10-15 percent ownership range, 8.5 percent for the 15-25 percent range,
13.5 percent for the 25-50 percent range, and 53.1 percent for the >50% range. The category
with no reported blockholders in Compact Disclosure is a special case: there, the 31.7
percent of errors is caused by either Compact Disclosure erroneously reporting no
blockholder or by the company choosing to omit a blockholder table from the proxy, and
instead putting blockholder information into the text.
Errors tend to increase with aggregate blockholdings in Compact Disclosure for the
simple reason that the errors themselves tend to increase the aggregates: e.g., an overlap for a
jointly held block of 25 percent will lead to a Compact Disclosure aggregate of 50 percent.
While the errors are rare for low levels of aggregate holdings, they are common at higher
levels and are economically significant. In the most extreme category (>50% in Compact
Disclosure), the average holdings in the raw data for firms with errors fall from over 100
percent (clearly impossible) to under 50 percent.

III.

A Representative Analysis: Outside Blockholders and Firm Value

In this section, we analyze the relationship between firm value and outside blockholdings
using both raw and cleaned data. Specifically, for each year t, we estimate

Qit = a + b1OWNit + b2OWN2it + cXit + eit,

(1)

where Q is a measure of industry-adjusted Tobin’s Q, OWN and OWN2 are the fraction and
fraction squared held by outside blockholders, X is a vector of control variables, and e is an
iid error term, all measured for firm i at time t. We follow Kaplan and Zingales (1997) and
measure Q as the ratio of the market value of assets to the book value of assets: the market
value is calculated as the sum of the book value of assets and the market value of common
stock less the book value of common stock and deferred taxes. The X vector includes a
Delaware incorporation dummy (Daines, 2001), an S&P 500 inclusion dummy (Morck and
Yang, 2001), the log of sales for the previous fiscal year, and the log of firm age (months
since first public listing).
We make no claims for any causal relationship here. Any regression of firm value on
ownership will be fraught with endogeneity concerns, a point first made by Demsetz and
Lehn (1985) and followed up by many other authors.7 Rather, we intend only to test whether
all this cleaning effort yields any meaningful differences in coefficient estimates or statistical
significance. To do so, we start with a simple and obvious regression.
Table 4 summarizes the results of regression (1) estimated separately for each year
from 1996 to 2001, with each regression estimated using both raw and cleaned data. The
results suggest that the raw data is much noisier, as the coefficients on the OWN variables are
7

For examples, see Loderer and Martin (1997), Himmelberg et al. (1999), Palia (2001), and Coles et al. (2003).

12

almost always closer to zero and lower in statistically significance than are the corresponding
coefficients using cleaned data.

Overall, the cleaned data demonstrate a far more robust

relationship between outside block ownership and firm value.

While the economic

interpretation of this result is clouded by endogeneity concerns, the research importance of
using the cleaned data is clear.

IV. Conclusion
Researchers rely on ownership data for many studies. The lack of a standardized
source of data on large blockholders is an impediment to this work. In this paper, we
document the weaknesses with the commonly used data, show how to fix them, and
demonstrate that these fixes are both quantitatively large and also important for the analysis
of a typical question.

Appendix A – Legal Rules
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, rules 13d-1 to 13d-7 (§240.13d) and rules 16a1 to 16e-1 (§240.16a-e), contain the legal definitions and filing requirements for what the
corporate finance literature has termed “blockholders”.

While 13D defines beneficial

ownership and describes the disclosure requirements of these shareholders, rules 16a-e detail
the reporting requirements on transactions made by corporate insiders. The company in turn
is required to disclose blockholder information to shareholders via proxies under Regulation
and Schedule 14a (§240.14a), commonly called the “proxy” statement.
Rule 13d-1(a) sets the threshold for beneficial ownership at 5% or more of a class of
stock. According to Rule 13d-3(a) a beneficial owner “includes any person who, directly or

13

indirectly, through any contract, understanding, relationship, or otherwise, has or shares”
voting or investment power. This rule has been interpreted to include shares that may be
obtained through the exercising of options, warrants, or rights in the next 60 days a part of
the beneficial ownership calculation. Any individual or group that has acquired a beneficial
stake in a class of equity is required to file the form SC 13D [see rule 13d-1(a)]. According to
Rule 13d-3(a), the form SC 13D must be filed within 10 days after the acquisition of the
equity position, and any material change in the position must be promptly filed in an
amended SC 13D [see 13d-1(a)]8. This form contains information about the person’s
relationship with the company and the nature of the holding. A select category of “persons”
such as banks, brokers and dealers, and insurance companies can file an abbreviated form,
the SC 13G. The SC 13G can only be used if the equity securities were acquired in the
ordinary course of business, and without the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the
control of the issuer [see 13d-1(b)].
Rule 13d-3 details how to determine beneficial ownership. For the purposes of
sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Act, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who,
directly or indirectly has or shares either voting or investment power over the security. Rule
13d-3 also specifies that creating trusts or pooling arrangements are not valid constructs to
avoid filing a form 13D. In fact, rule 13d-3(c) specifies, “all securities of the same class
beneficially owned by a person, regardless of the form which such beneficial ownership
takes, shall be aggregated in calculating the number of shares beneficially owned by such
person”.

Rule 13d-7 regulates the dissemination of form 13D. For our purposes, it is

important that the issuer of the security must be notified of the existence of a large
shareholder at its principal executive office, by registered or certified mail.
8

According to rule 13d-2(a), The SEC deems a 1% change in the ownership position as material.

14

The second set of laws of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulating filing
requirements for blockholders is detailed in rules 16a-1 to 16e-1 (“Reports of Directors,
Officers, and Principal Shareholders”). Pursuant to this section, a person (“principal
shareholder”) deemed a beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of equity securities
registered under section 12 of the Act (“Registration Requirements for Securities”), as well
as any director or officer of the company needs to file forms 3, 4, and 5. Initial statements of
beneficial ownership of equity securities required by section 16(a) of the Act are filed on
Form 3. Statements of changes in beneficial ownership required by that section are filed on
Form 4, and annual statements are filed on Form 5. While the 13D/G forms are laid out to
disclose the size and nature of the holdings of a large blockholder (who owns more than five
percent, what their purpose is, whether they intend to buy more, their voting power, etc.), the
3,4,5 forms are structured to disclose any transactions made by a company insider. Without
discussing anything about the intent of the shareholder, the 3,4,5 forms list what was bought
or sold and when, making them more transaction oriented than disclosure oriented.
The laws regulating a company’s disclosure requirements of large blockholder
information to shareholders are detailed in Regulation 14A (“Solicitation of Proxies”) and
Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (§240.14a). Pursuant to Schedule
14A(6-d) with reference to Item 403 of Regulation S-K (§229.403) entitled “Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management,” a company is required to
disclose two types of tables in proxies: one listing shareholders who own more than 5% of
any class of the company’s equity securities, and another listing any ownership of equity
securities by all directors and officers of the company. The tables can be combined at the
company’s option and should list the number of shares beneficially owned and the

15

percentage of the class owned. Item 403 does specify a tabular format to be used, but it does
not specify the location where this information should appear in the proxy. Item 403 also
explains that a company may rely on the information disclosed in the SC 13D/G forms by
beneficial owners when preparing this information for proxies.
Item 403 refers to Rule 13d-3 for the determination of beneficial ownership, and it
details specific guidelines for disclosing the nature of the beneficial ownership. Information
in sub-columns or footnotes must be included and reflect the number of shares of which a
beneficial owner has sole or shared voting power as well as sole or shared investment power.
Similarly, the number of shares a beneficial owner has the right to acquire must be listed in a
footnote, as well as any arrangements or pledges that could lead to a change of control of
shares. Item 403 also specifies that a company must use appropriate disclosure to avoid
confusion where more than one beneficial owner is listed for the same securities. When a
beneficial owner owns shares pursuant to a voting trust or agreement, the company must state
in a table or footnote the title of the securities, the amount held or to be held according to the
trust or agreement, and the duration of the agreement. The company must also disclose the
names and addresses of the voting trustees and outline briefly their voting rights and powers
under the trust or agreement.

Appendix B – Details on the Sample Construction
In a first step, we matched the IRRC database with data from Compact Disclosure
pertaining to large shareholders and directors and officers. Compact Disclosure stores
company data on CDs that are updated monthly. The month of the update depends on the
company’s fiscal year end, and, for data pertaining to the board of directors, on the

16

company’s proxy meeting date. Since Compact Disclosure often does not keep information
until the next update, but rather removes stale data from the monthly CDs, searching the right
month after the proxy meeting is important. In the earlier sample years, a lag of 6 months
from proxy meeting month to issuance of data CD yielded the most reliable results. Starting
in 2000, Compact Disclosure data are usually updated in the month following the annual
meeting.
We then sort, for each sample year, all IRRC firms by proxy meeting month. We
download through a ticker merge the large shareholder data (field SH) and information on
directors (field DO) and officers (field NA) from the appropriate monthly Compact
Disclosure CD in the tagged format. Figure 1 shows an example of our raw database. The
search string automatically yields a summary of the insider-trading data compiled by
Spectrum (Form 3, 4, and 5), which we discard.9 Note from Figure 1 that Compact
Disclosure mentions the source and source date of the director and ownership information in
parentheses. We control in the sample construction that all ownership information is taken
from proxy statements. We are able to match 94% of all firm-years with our search strategy
through Compact Disclosure. The remaining firms were looked up directly from the proxies.
In a next step, we use a SAS program to convert the data of Figure 1 into an easy-touse SAS database. The SAS program loops through the information on officers and directors,
provided by Compact Disclosure in the fields NA- and DO-, and identifies a large

9

Anderson and Lee (1997a) caution that the proxy’s definition of an insider (an officer or director) is not the
same as the definition used for the insider-trading filings (any shareholder of 10% or more) compiled by
Spectrum. When they compare Spectrum data to the benchmark proxy data on management ownership, they
find that 40.7% of their sample has a reporting discrepancy of over 5% (p. 316). They also refute the claim that
the Spectrum data are more current than the most recent proxy data, showing that the filing dates listed in the
Spectrum section of the Compact Disclosure data are sometimes “stale” by two or more years (Anderson and
Lee (1997b), p. 3-4). An additional concern for us is a date mismatch, as the Spectrum data is updated at various
points during the year, while the director’s database stems from the annual proxy statements. Indeed, the
Spectrum data of Figure 1 is incorrect.

17

shareholder entry as either director or officer if the character string for a blockholder (in the
SH- section of the Compact Disclosure data) matched a character string in the officer or
director sections (NA-, DO-) of the data. Compact Disclosure is extremely accurate and
consistent in the spelling of names across fields, as it takes the names exactly as they appear
in the proxy statements.10

10

However, the automated process will not correctly match variations such as “The Smith family trust” with a
director named Peter H. Smith. These corrections are done manually in the data cleaning process.

The table describes summary statistics of key sample firm characteristics. The sample period
is 1996 – 2001. The total sample consists of large publicly listed U.S. firms, a total of 7,649
firm-years and 1,913 unique firms. The table contains cross-sectional means and medians of
firm time-series averages. Firm age is measured as months since first listing. Market value,
total assets, sales, and common equity are taken from Compustat. The book-to-market ratio is
book value of common equity to market value of common equity. Book value of common
equity is the sum of book common equity (Compustat item 60) and deferred taxes (item 74).
The capex-to-sales ratio is capital expenditures (item 128) divided by net sales. Q is the
market value of assets divided by the book value of assets (item 6), where the market value
of assets is computed as book value of assets plus the market value of common stock less the
sum of the book value of common stock (item 60) and balance sheet deferred taxes (item 74).
All book values for fiscal year t (from Compustat) are combined with the market value of
common equity at the calendar end of year t. Return on assets (equity) is calculated as
income before extraordinary items (item 18) divided by item 6 (item 60). G-score is an equal
weighted index that measures the restrictions of shareholder rights, and is provided through
Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). All director variables are from the director
database of the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC).

The first three rows of this table contain summary statistics for the cleaned sample by
calendar year. The sample construction is explained in Appendix B. The bottom part of the
table shows the frequency of each category of large shareholders. Officers are officers, and
possibly also directors of the firm. Directors are all non-officer directors. Affiliated entities
are individuals, trusts or companies whose voting outcome is at least partially influenced or
outright determined by an officer or director of the company. ESOPs are Employee Stock
Ownership Plans. Outside Blockholders are all individuals or entities that are none of the
above.

Situations that required cleaning:

This table reports the occurrence of the four problems associated with using the raw large
shareholder database available through Compact Disclosure. We classify the firms into six
different categories based on the sum of the blockholdings. The first row shows the number
of firms by blockholding category. The second row shows the fraction of entries by category
that needed to be corrected. The third and fourth row contain the average sum of
blockholdings by category before and after cleaning, where the categorization is done by the
sum of blockholdings as they appear in the raw data. The second part of the table describes
the four situations that required cleaning. The four problems are full overlap, partial overlap,
the treatment of preferred shares, and other problems. The second and third row of each
reported problem show how the percentage holdings change given we observe the problem.

Raw Compact Disclosure data

Cleaned data

This table presents the coefficients of the sum of outside blockholdings and squared outside
blockholdings, before and after our cleaning procedure, from annual cross-sectional
regressions of industry-adjusted Tobin's Q on the blockholdings and control variables. The
control variables include a Delaware dummy, S&P 500 affiliation, the natural logarithm of
firm age in months (measured as months since first listing, obtained from CRSP), and the
natural logarithm of firm sales (obtained from Compustat). For simplicity, the coefficients on
the control variables are omitted from the table. Standard errors are reported in parentheses
and significance at the one-percent and five-percent levels is indicated by ** and *
respectively. Entries in bold demonstrate a difference in statistical significance between the
raw Compact Disclosure and the cleaned data. Q is the ratio of the market value of assets to
the book value of assets: the market value is calculated as the sum of the book value of assets
and the market value of common stock less the book value of common stock and deferred
taxes. The market value of equity is measured at the end of the current calendar year, and the
accounting variables are measured in the current fiscal year. Industry adjustments are made
by subtracting the industry median, where medians are calculated by matching the four-digit
SIC codes from December of each year to the 48 industries designated by Fama and French
[1997].
