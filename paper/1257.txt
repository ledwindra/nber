Can the Production Smoothing Model of
Inventory Behavior be Saved?

ABSTRACT

The production smoothing model of inventory behavior has a long and
venerable history, and theoretical foundations which seem very strong. Yet
certain overwhelming facts seem not only to defy explanation within the
production smoothing framework, but actually to argue that the basic idea of

production smoothing is all wrong. Most prominent wnong these is the
fact that the variance of detrended production exceeds the variance of
detrended sales.

This paper first documents the stylized facts. Then it derives the
production smoothing model rigorously and explains how the model can be

amended to make it consistent with the facts. Next, estimates of stock
adjustment equations derived from the theory are presented and evaluated.

Finally, it reviews the theoretical and empirical evidence and tries to draw
some tentative conclusions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The production smoothing model of inventory behavior has a

long and venerable history. <1> Its theoretical foundations
seem very strong. All that is necessary to create a
production- smoothing motive for holding inventories is that
demand vary through time and that the short-run cost function
be convex (i.e., the short—run production function be concave).
If, in addition, there is a random element to demand,
inventories will also serve as a buffer stock.

These conditions appear to be very weak — so weak, in
fact, that it is hard to imagine how they could fail to hold.
In addition, the production smoothing model has been used with

some success in empirical work on inventories. <2> Under the
special assumption that costs are quadratic, it leads to the

"partial adjustment model that dominates empirical work on the
subject. <3>
Yet

the production smoothing model is in trouble. Certain

overwhelming facts seem not only to defy explanation within the
production smoothing framework, but actually to argue that the

basic idea of production smoothing is all wrong. To elucidate
these facts, consider the following accounting identity:
(1.1)

=

X

+ Nt+l

—

Nt

where Y is production, X is sales, and Nt is the stock of
inventories at the beginning of period t. If lower case

Page 2

symbols are used to denote the detrended values of the
corresponding upper case symbols, this identity leads to the
following decomposition of the variance of Y about trend:

(1.2) var(y) =

var(x)

+

var(n)

+

2cov(x,n).

The first two facts of interest pertain to equation (1.2).

FACT 1: The variance of detrended production exceeds the
variance of detrended. sales: var(y) > var(x).

If firms use inventories to smooth production in the face
of fluctuating sales, it is surprising indeed that production

is more variable than sales. This remarkable fact has been
known for a long time at the aggregate level, where y stands

for real GNP and x stands for real final sales. <4> In Blinder
(1981), I showed that var(y) exceeds var(x) for retailing as a

whole and for 7 of 8 two-digit retail industries. In Section
II, I show that production is more variable than sales in
manufacturing as a whole and in 18 of the 20 two— digit

manufacturing industries. Thus the finding that var(y) >
var(x) seems to hold quite generally. Recently, West (1983a)
has used a more elaborate version of this inequality to derive
a test of the validity of the production smoothing model in
several nondurable manufacturing industries ——

with

mostly

negative results.

FACT 2: The covariance between sales and inventory change
is not negative.

Page 3

If inventories are used to buffer output against shocks to

demand, then inventories should fall when sales spurt and rise

when sales slump. In fact, the covariance between sales and
inventory change is strongly positive for GNP as a whole (that
is, inventory investment is strongly procyclical) and weakly

positive in the retail sector. <5> I show in Section II that
there are only a few manufacturing industries in which cov(x,

An) is substantially negative. If inventories play a buffer
stock role at all, it must be swamped by other considerations.
<6>

FACT 3: When a partial-adjustment inventory equation of

the form:

(1.3) Nt÷i

where

Nt =

i

(N÷1— N)

—

(l2)(Xt

—

t_ixt)

+

is expected sales, N1 is (some proxy for) desired

inventories, and uis a stochastic disturbance term, is
estimated, the estimated

normally turns out to be quite

low while the estimated B2 turns out to be quite high.
This, of course, is not a "fact" like the others, but

depends on estimation techniques, etc. That this finding is
troublesome

to the production smoothing model can be understood

best by using identity

(1.1) to write (1.3) as an equation for

output:

(1.4) Yt =

t.iXt

+Bl(Nt+l —

Nt)

+

B(Xt

—

t_1xt)

+ u.

Ut

Page 4

According to equation (1.4), production deviates from expected
sales according to how much inventory change is desired ——

the

term 1(N* — Nt) -— and how much sales deviate from what was
t+1
expected ——

the term 2(Xt

t_iXt). If cost conditions

dictate a great deal of production smoothing, it would seem
that both

and

should be low, i.e., output should not

react much to either inventor

sales fluctuations. On the other hand, if cost conditions
dictate relatively little smoothing, then both i and2
should be high. Empirically, however, we find smal11

and

large 2' which seems hard to reconcile with the theory. <7>

Taken as a whole, these facts add up to a stunning
indictment of the production smoothing/buffer stock model.
Yet, as. I indicated at the outset, the theory that underlies

this model requires little more than a concave short—run

production function. There seems to be more than a little
tension here between theory and fact.

There are several ways to resolve this dilemma. In my
earlier paper on retail inventories (Blinder (1981)), I
suggested that the technology of the retail firm is not in fact
concave, and nominated the (S,s) model as a replacement for the

production smoothing model. This model, which is based on a
fixed cost of placing and receiving an order, has little

trouble accounting for the stylized facts. Furthermore, I

Page. 5

showed that, under certain restrictive assumptions, it leads to
an estimating equation that is very similar to the stock
adjustment model.

Since the stylized facts of inventory behavior in
manufacturing are so similar to those in retailing, it is

tempting to adopt the same explanation for manufacturing. And
it might even be correct. But I am hesitant to do so for
several reasons.

The first is that the basic technological assumption that
underlies the (S,s) model is far less appealing on a priori

grounds for manufacturers than it is for retailers. The cost
function that makes (S,s) inventory behavior optimal is:
C(Y) =

=

A + mY

if Y>O

0

if Y0,

where A and m are positive constants. For retailers, A is the
fixed cost and in

is

the (constant) marginal cost at which they

can purchase goods from manufacturers. For manufacturers, such
a cost structure connotes a substantial set—up cost followed by

constant marginal costs thereafter. While this may be an
appealing description of costs for some industrial processes
(where production in large batches is optimal), it is far from
obvious that it typifies manufacturing technology.

Second, the (S,s) model requires that sales be beyond the
firm's control, which is quite hard to swallow in many

oligopolistic manufacturing industries. (Think, for example,
of automobiles, steel, and chemicals.)

Page 6

Third, if we give up the assumption that the production
function is concave, we give up much of neoclassical economic

in the bargain. Of course, if production functions
really are convex, then so much the worse for neoclassical
economics. Theory must be bent to fit facts, not the other
thought

around.

way

My point is simply that abandoning concavity is not

something

that should be taken lightly. <8>

In fact, one way to interpret this paper is as a last—
ditch effort to save the assumption that the (short—run)

production function is concave from the scrapheap of discarded

doctrines. I leave it to the reader to decide whether the
rescue mission was successful.

The paper is organized into four sections. Section II is
factual: it documents Facts 1 and 2 and several others as

well. Section III is theoretical: it derives the production
smoothing! buffer stock model rigorously and explains how the
riodel can be made consistent with the facts. Section IV is

econometric: estimates of stock adjustment equations derived
from the theory are presented and evaluated. Finally, Section
V is impressionistic: it reviews the theoretical and empirical
evidence and tries to draw some tentative conclusions. But
these are certainly more tentative than conclusive.

II. THE STYLIZED FACTS ABOUT MANUFACTURING INVENTORIES

The empirical parts of this paper study monthly,

seasonally adjusted data on sales and inventories in billions
of 1972 dollars, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis

(BEA). Inventories are broken down by stage of processing
(materials and supplies, works in progress, and finished goods)

and by industry (10 durable sectors and 10 nondurable sectors).
The period of study runs from February 1959 (the first nonth
for which opening stocks of inventories are available) through
December 1981.

Before looking at the data, it is wise to get some

accounting identities straight. Figure 1 will help. In this
schema X denotes sales, F denotes the stock of finished goods,
and

W

denotes the stock of works in progress (henceforth

"works"). It indicates that:
Cl) Items that are started within the period might be
counted as works in progress (path a), finished goods (path b),
or shipments to customers (path c) by the end of the period.
(2) Items that began the period as works in progress

might still be in progress, or might be recorded as finished
goods (path d), or as sales (path e) by the end of the period.
(3) Items that started the period as finished goods are
either sold within the period (path f) or remain in inventory.

Page 7A

Page 8

Adding up these possibilities (using obvious notation), we
see that sales are given by:

(2.1) X=c+e+f,
while a natural definition of production is:

(2.2) Y=a-Fb+c.
Similarly, the change in the stock of finished goods is:

l

-afl LL

(2.3) F = b + d —
L. b LJJS. UI. WUL. S.b .1.11 I.IJLJL bb Lb ILl LLlt

(2.4) AW=a-d-e.
Adding up (2.3) and (2.4) gives:

EF + W = a + b -

Ce + f),

which, according to (2.1) and (2.2), is exactly equal to Y—X.
So we see that the concept of inventories that satisfies the
identity
(1.1)

Nt÷lNt=Yt_Xt,

is the sum of finished goods plus works in progress. I will
henceforth denote this sum by the symbol N, in accord with
(1.1).

Data on shipments and inventories of finished goods and
works in progress were used, in conjunction with identity (1.1)
to create a series on production for each industry. <10> Then

all the series were detrended by the following model of the
trend component:

log(Z) = a0 + a1TIME + a2DTIME + a3 D66 + Ut,
where TIME is a time trend beginning at I in January 1959,

DTIME is a second time trend beginning at 1 at the first OPEC

Page 9

shock (October 1973), and D66 is a dummy variable equal to 1
for all observations in 1966—1982. (D66 is motivated by a data

revision that went back only to 1966.) To get more efficient
estimates of the trends, estimation was by generalized least

squares with u assumed to follow a second—order autoregressive
scheme. <11> This is exactly the same procedure I used earlier
on the retailing data (Blinder (1981)), which facilitates
comparisons.

With these definitions understood, Table 1 shows the
decomposition of the variance of detrended production as in
equation (1.2). <12> A number of conclusions are apparent.
First, and most important, the variance of production is
generally larger than the variance of sales, and sometimes much
larger. Primary metals is the only industry in which sales has
a bigger variance that production. The ratio of var(y)/var(x)
ranges from a high of 2.40 to a low of 0.95, and is 1.14 for

manufacturing as a whole. (The corresponding ratio for
retailing was 1.15.)

Second, notice from (1.2) that var(y) cannot possibly be
less than var(x) unless the covariance between x and tn is
negative enough to overwhelm the variance of tin. In the

durables sector, this covariance is negative in only 2 of 10

industries; and the only nontrivial negative value occurs in

primary metals (where =—.22). By contrast, large positive
covariances are found in electrical machinery (p.33),
non—electrical machinery (p=.45), and transportation equipment

(p=.29). Thus Fact 2 in the introduction holds particularly
strongly in the durables sector. Things are more mixed in the
nondurables sector: the covariance is positive half the time
and

negative

half the time, but generally of trivial magnitude.

Believers in a buffer stock role for inventories will
raise several questions about this finding. First, recall that:
cov(x,tn) =

cov(x,Af)

+

cov(x,w).

Could it be that a negative covariance between sales and
changes in finished goods inventories (evidence for a buffer
stock role for inventories) is hidden by an even stronger
positive covariance between sales and changes in works in

progress? Regrettably, the answer is no. The correlation
between x and Lf is negative in only 7 of 20 industries, and
more negative than —.10 in only 3 industries.
Second, would the buffer stock role of finished goods
inventories look more important if we replaced the deviation of

sales from trend by the change in sales, or by unexpected
sales? Only a little. Coy (Ax,isf) is negative in only 9 of 20

industries. The same is true of cov(x,Af), where x is a
proxy fOr unexpected sales explained later in the paper.
Once the disaggregation of inventories by stage of
processing is brought up, several additional questions arise.

Tables 2 and 3 address some of these questions.
which of the three types of inventory is most important

quantitatively? As Tables 2 and 3 show, there are some
systematic differences between durable and nondurable

industries in this respect. <13>

Over the period 1959—1981, 6 of the 10 durables industries
did more investment in works in progress than in any other type

of inventory; 3 of the remaining 4 industries invested most in
materials and supplies. (The largest number in each line is
underlined.) However, if we look at stocks instead of flows,
that is, at inventory/sales ratios, the picture is more mixed.

Inventory holdings are mostly stocks of works in progress in 4
industries, mostly finished goods in 3, and mostly materials
and

supplies

in the remaining 3.

In the nondurables industries, works in progress

inventories are rather unimportant. Six of the 10 nondurables
sectors did most of their inventory investment in the form of
finished goods, and the others concentrated on materials and

supplies. This picture changes but slightly if we focus on
stocks (inventory/sales ratios) rather than on flows.

Variances, rather than means, are more important for

business cycle analysis. Table 3 continues to show that
inventory investment in works in progress is quite unimportant
in nondurable goods industries, but quite important in
durables. (In each line of Table 3, the largest of the three

variances is underlined.) However, it is noteworthy (given
this paper's concentration on finished goods) that inventories
of finished goods look more important in the durables
industries when we consider variances instead of means.
It is natural to ask whether the different types of

Page 12

inventories display different behavior or tend to march in lock

step with one another. For this purpose, Table 3 displays
correlation coefficients among the three types of inventory

change. The major conclusion, I think, is that these numbers

are very small; each type of inventory movement seems to have
a life of its own.
Changes in finished goods and changes in works in progress

typically are positively correlated; but the correlation is
large only in the primary metals industry. Few other

generalizations can be made. Changes in finished goods and
changes in materials and supplies are negatively correlated in
14 of 20 sectors, but the strongest correlations are positive
(in electrical machinery and transportation equipment).

Changes in works and materials are nearly orthogonal in the
nondurable industries, but show mixed results in the durable•
industries.

Before leaving these data, one further fascinating

observation should be made. Look

at

the second column of Table

1. While the variance of sales in the durables sector is 5.21,
the sums of the variances in the 10 industries that comprise

this sector is only 1.40. The remaining 3.81
three—quarters of the total variance ——

is

or

accounted for by the

covariances among the sales of the 10 industries. Much the
same pattern holds in the nondurables sector, where the
variances of sales of the 10 industries sum to only .177 while

the variance of nondurable sales as a whole is .694. This

Page 13

domination by the covariances suggests, but does not prove,

that there is a dramatic common "business cycle" element in the
sales of the various manufacturing industries. <14>

To what conclusions are we led by this quick perusal of

the facts? First, the production smoothing/buffer stock model
looks dubious at best. Consequently, the next section is
devoted to modifying the theory so as to make it more
consistent with the facts.

Second, all three types of inventories appear to make
independent contributions to the variance of total inventory

investment. This suggests seeking separate empirical
explanations for each type of inventory. The empirical work
reported in Section IV deals only with finished goods; research
on the other two types of inventory investment would be
worthwhile.

Third, there are enough differences across industries in
Tables 1-3 to make aggregation look hazardous; hence I adopt a
disaggregated approach to the empirical work in Section IV.
Fourth, most of the variance in manufacturing sales and
output is contributed by pervasive positive covariances among
the sales and output of component industries, which suggests a
very strong common business cycle element in U.S. manufacturing
industries.

III. THE THEORY OF PRODUCTION SMOOTHING

1. Concepts and Notation
The model used here is a generalization of Blinder (1982),

and uses the notation employed there. Specifically, consider a
value— maximizing firm with linear demand curve:
—
+ 2d
2dPt
2d0
where P is the price in period t and X is the quantity sold.

(3.1) X =

The demand shock,rlt, has a complex structure that will be

specified presently.

The firm is assumed to have quadratic costs of production:

(3.2) C(Yt) = c0 + Cc1

where

+)Y +

cL/2c)Y

,

is output and Ft is a cost shock representing

stochastic disturbances to either technology or factor prices.

The curvature parameter c is critical to the production

smoothing issue. A low value of c connotes a steeply
increasing marginal cost curve, and hence a strong motive to
smooth production.

Similarly, the firm is assumed to have quadratic costs of
holding inventories:

(3.3) B(Nt) = b0 + biNt + (b/2)N ,
where Nt is the stock of inventories at the beginning of
period t. The model treats only inventories of finished goods,
which is why the empirical work is restricted to this type of

Page 15

inventory. The curvature parameter b is again critical to the
production smoothing issue. A large value of b makes it costly
to vary inventories, and hence will discourage the firm from
using inventory movements to smooth production.
If D=l/(l+i) is the discount rate, the firm seeks to
maximize:
(3.4)

B(Nt+ )},

where X, C(Y), and B(N) are as given above. Before solving the
problem,

it

is useful to define production smoothing precisely,

that is the central issue of the paper. One obvious
definition is:
because

DEFINITION

1: A firm is said to smooth production if the

(unconditional)

variance of production is less than the

(unconditional)

variance of sales: var(Y) < var(X).

For obvious reasons, I call this "long—run production
smoothing." Fact 1 in the introduction can be interpreted as
saying, that firms do not smooth production by this definition.
For "short—run production smoothing," I offer two
definitions. •The first is more useful in empirical
applications, while the second is easier to work with
theoretically.

DEFINITION 2: A firm is said to smooth production if, in

Page 16

response to a positive (negative) demand shock, production
rises (falls) less than sales so that inventories decline
(rise):

(Yt -X)
t

<0.

1-1t

DEFINITION 3: A firm is said to smooth production if its
production responds less to a sales shock than it would if it
could not carry inventories:
t

ant

(

t
ant

where the * denotes a firm that cannot carry inventories.

If either inequality is reversed, I will say there is

production "bunching" instead. It is easy to show that if
production is smoothed by Definition 3, then it is also

smoothed by Definition 2. But, the converse does not hold.

2. The Informational Structure

Because expectations are assumed to be rational, the

information structure is critical to the solution. I assumed
that the firm observes its cost shock for period t before
making its decisions on production and price for period t. This
seems a natural specification if cost shocks represent
fluctuations in input prices, but not so natural if they
represent stochastic aspects of the technology.
For the demand shock, I employ a general structure that

Page 17

admits of several interpretations. Specifically, the demand
shock is assumed to have two independent components:

t=

1

2

+

which differ only in that the firm can observe
before it makes its decisions on Pt and Y .

Two polar cases are evident. If the

shock is absent,

then the firm knows its demand curve before making its

decisions and the sales "surprise" is a surprise only to the

econometrician. If the 't shock is absent, the firm must make
its decisions before it knows its demand curve, and sales

surprises really are surprises. <15> The distinction between
these two versions of "unanticipated" sales turns out to be

critical to reconciling the theory with the data. I interpret
the empirical evidence as suggesting that

nore important than

shocks are far

shocks.

To recapitulate briefly, the firm inherits an opening

stock of inventories (Nt) which is the legacy of the past. It
then observes its cost shock (re) and part of its demand shock

() before choosing its level of production (Yt), price

and expected sales. After these decisions are made, the rest
of the demand shock (ri) is observed and actual sales (Xt) are
determined. The beginning—of--period inventory for period t+1

then follows from the identity:

3. The Solution: Optimal Inventory Policy

where Y, X, and N are respectively the nonstochastic steady
state values of output, sales, and inventories (naturally,
Y=X).

These first—order conditions have straightforward
interpretations. Equation (3.7) equates marginal cost to the

shadow value of inventories; equation (3.8) equates expected

marginal revenue to the shadow value of inventories; and
equation (3.9) states that the increase in the shadow value

must just compensate the firm for both the interest costs and
explicit holding costs of carrying inventories.

Notice that (3.7) is a decision rule for actual
production, but (3.8) is a rule only for expected sales.
Actual sales are related to expected sales by:

X —

(3.10)

which follows from (3.1).

x = 2d(nt — Etflt)

To make these rules operational, we must solve for the
initial value of the shadow value of inventories,Xt .

This

is

a tedious calculation which is done in the appendix. The
result is:

the exact solution depends on the specific nature of the
shocks.

cases, but to start I assume that both demand shocks are
ARMA(l,1) processes:

Equation (3.16) is the basis for the effort to reconcile

the theory with the stylized facts that follows. It also
provides the theoretical underpinning for the econometric work
in Section IV.

4. Short—Run Production Smoothing

More apparatus is necessary before we can deal with
long—run production smoothing, but we already know enough to

study short—run production smoothing. First note that a firm
with no inventories would solve a static profit— maximization
problem and equate marginal cost:

to

MCt = C1 + (l/c)Yt +
expected marginal revenue. Since the inverse demand curve

is:

Pt =

(d0/d)

—

(i/2d)Xt+

expected marginal revenue is:
=

(d0/d)

-

(l/d)Xt

+

nt'

Page 22

Equating the two and noting that Yt=E(Xt) in the absence of
inventories yields:

-Y

•

(dc/(d+c))(

=

.t -

From Definition 3, a natural quantitative measure of the
degree of production smoothing is:

•S =1—
Y

Using this formula and the above expression for Y, we find:
= 1 -

S
y

Using (3.14), this is

s =
s,,

l—z

-

9Y4-

((c+d)/cd)t

readily

seen to be:
z —Op—mO(1—z

(i+inO) =

1-Op

=1

for v1 type shocks;
for v type shocks.

Thus production smoothing is complete for truly unexpected
sales, but production bunching is actually possible for the

econometrician's version of "unexpected sales." Remembering
that 0 =1/z2, we see that some smoothing will take place if and
only if:
1-I-i —

(3.17)

P

> m(l—z1) ,

which must be true for AR(1) demand shocks (m=O), but can be
false if m is large enough.

The inuition behind this result is as follows. Consider
the implied moving average coefficients when the stochastic
process is ARMA(l,l):

=

pr1_1 +

We have:
an
—=1
a

= P

+ m

p(p+m)

mv +

Page 23

So if p+m>l, the response pattern "builds" at first before
decaying.

Suppose a firm sees a positive value of v, connoting a
good period for sales. If the shock is AR(l), the firm will
expect the ensuing periods to also be good, but not quite as

good as period t. Hence it has an incentive to sell out of
inventory, i.e., to smooth production. However, if the shock
is ARMA(l,l), the firm will expect next period to be even

better than this period (if P+m>l). If P+m exceeds 1 by enough
(as defined by (3.17)), the firm will actually want to build

inventories for future sale. So it will bunch, rather than
smooth, production.

Naturally, a firm that smooths production will "bunch"

sales, and conversely. It is easy to show that a smoothing
measure for sales,

that is defined analogously to S,, is

related to S, by the simple formula:

S = _(d/c)S.
Equally naturally, a firm will smooth its price behavior only
if it bunches its sales, that is, only if it also smooths its

production. <16> In the model, a measure of price smoothing
defined analogously to Sy is related to S by the simple formula:

Page 24

S = (d/(2d+c))S
p
y
Thus condition (3.17) is pivotalto the firm's behavior.
If it holds, as it must unless demand shocks have a strong

moving— average component, the firm smooths both produOtion and
sales and plans to draw down inventories when demand is high.

These reactions are just what we expect. But if (3.17) fails
to hold, the firm's optimal behavior is counterintuitive. It
smooths sales, not production (nor price), and plans to build
inventories in periods when demand is unusually high.

With this analysis complete, we are now ready to address
the four stylized facts mentioned in the introduction.

5. Fact 3: Puzzling Regression Estimates

I begin with Fact 3, which was that econometric inventory
investment equations like:

(1.3) Nt+i — Nt =

1(N1

—

N)t)

—

(l2)(Xt

tend to produce low estimates of the parameter
estimates of the parameter 2

—

t_lXt)

+

and high

It is useful to compare the

theoretical equation (3.16) to the empirical specification
(1.3).

Notice first that (3.16) does have the partial adjustment

form assumed in (1.3). In the absence of shocks, inventory
change is a fixed fraction of the gap between N and Nt. This
fraction ——

"the

speed of adjustment" —— depends on the

curvatures of the revenue and cost functions, and on the rate

Page 25

of interest (see (3.12)). Low

estimated

adjustment speeds,

therefore, suggest a high value of z1.

However, N is not the firm's desired inventory stock. A
natural definition of the desired inventory stock, call it

N+l, is the value of Nt that makes desired inventory change
equal to zero, conditional on. the information available at time

t. Equating the expectation of the righthand side of (3.16) to
zero, we can express Nt+i as a function of N and the stochastic

shocks that are known at time t. If this definition of N1 is
then substituted back into (3.16), a little algebra shows that
(3.16) can be written as:

=

—
(1—z1) (Nt+i — Nt)
Etnt),
where (3.10) has been used to replace 2dv by unexpected

Nt÷i —

Nt

(n

sales.

Thus we have two distInct concepts of "target" or

"desired" inventories. i

is

the steady state level; its value

depends on cost parameters, the rate of interest, and the mean

position of the demand curve. We may assume that it moves
rather slowly through time and is quite insensitive to

fluctuations in sales. By contrast, N+l is the current
target. Because it responds to new information, it may well

exhibit rapid swings from one period to the next. The

distinction between N and N1 is reminiscent of Feldstein and
Auerbach's (1976) notion that actual inventories adjust rapidly
to their target, but that the target itself adjusts only

slowly. The model therefore provides a rigorous justification

Page 26

for inventory behavior that is consistent with the spirit, but
not the letter, of Feldstein and Auerbach's analysis.
Next consider the parameter

in (1.3). The model offers

two possible theoretical interpretations of "unexpected sales."

The most natural definition is 2dv ——

the

difference between

what the firm sells and what it expected to sell when it made

its production and price decisions. By this definition,
unexpected sales enters the inventory equation with a

coefficient of exactly —1. However, the econometrician's
version of "unexpected sales" is likely to include both

and

v. As noted earlier, the theoretical coefficient of a v
shock is negative if and only if (3.17) holds.

Putting all this together, we have the following potential
explanation for Fact 3:
(a) Technological conditions produce a high value of
z1, that is, a slow speed of adjustment. This will occur if

b(c+d) is fairly small, which means either that inventory
storage costs are nearly linear or that the marginal cost
and/or marginal revenue schedules are quite steep.
(b) Much of what looks like unexpected sales to the
economëtriCiafl is not actually unexpected by the firm, and

condition (3.17) fails to hold. The empirical coefficient
will then be a weighted average of -1 and the (positive)

coefficient of a v demand shock. Therefore, with v shocks
quantitatively more important than

shocks, it would not be

surprising to find a very small estimated value of

Page 27
On this view, the coefficients of initial inventories arid

unexpected sales in an econometric inventory equation depend

upon fundamentally different characteristics of the firm. The
former depends on technology and demand parameters, while the
latter depends principally on how quickly the firm learns about

demand shocks. Accordingly, no relationship between the two
coefficients can possibly refute the production smoothing
model, in contradiction to the claim made by Feldstein and
Auerbach (1976) and others.

6. Fact 1: Var(Y) Exceeds Var(X)

The remaining stylized facts mentioned in the introduction
involve the unconditional variances and covariances of X, Y,

and N. Some fairly tedious manipulations detailed in the
appendix lead to the following expression for the shadow value
of inventories:

(3.18) (l_ziL)X =

t-l

Given this expression for the shadow value, and equations

(3.7) and (3.8) for Y and X, can the model ever rationalize
the fact that var(Y) > var(X)? Clearly it can, if cost shocks
are big enough. Intuitively, it seems clear that demand shocks
tend to produce high variance in X while cost shocks tend to

1

JV

l-pL

Page 28

produce high variance in Y. More specifically, the appendix
establishes the following:

PROPOSITION 1: In a simplified version of the model with
no demand shocks and r=O (serial correlation of the cost shock
is an unnecessary complication for this purpose), var(Y) >
var(X) for any admissible values of the parameters.

Hence cost shocks are always a potential explanation of
Fact 1 if the variance of cost shocks is large enough relative

to the variance of demand shocks. However, this explanation
comes perilously close to assuming the conclusion, and for this
reason is not very satisfying.
The remaining propositions, all proven in the appendix,
pertain to a model in which cost shocks are absent.

PROPOSITION 2: In a simplified version of the model with

no cost shoôks and a serially independent demand shock which
the firm sees before deciding on production, var(X) > var (Y)

for any admissible values of the parameters. However, as
approaches zero, the ratio var(X)/var(Y) approaches 1. <17>

Together, Propositions 1 and 2 provide a potentially more
satisfying explanation of the fact that var(Y) > var(X).
Suppose the technology makes z1 very small, so that in the
absence of cost shocks var(X) would be only slightly larger

Page 29

than var(Y). Then even relatively minor cost shocks could tip
the balance and turn var(Y) > var(X).

The problem with this explanation is that the empirical
evidence suggests rather slow adjustment speeds, that is,

rather high values of z1. According to the logic of
Proposition 2, a high value of z1 will leave var(X)

substantially larger than var(Y). An alternative explanation
of Fact 1 would be desirable. One is provided by the next
proposition.

PROPOSITION 3: In a simplified version of the model with
no cost shock and an AR(l) demand shock which is known before
output is set, var(X) > var(Y) for any admissible parameter

values. However, the ratio var(X)/var(Y) approaches 1 as the
autoregressive parameter p approaches 1, that is, as demand

shocks become permanent. This holds for any value of z1. <18>

The intuition behind Proposition 3 is clear. As the stochastic
structure of the demand shock gets closer to a random walk,

demand disturbances become more permanent. Hence the firm is
more likely to adjust its production fully.

Propositions 1 and 3 together provide a potentially better

explanation of the fact that var(Y)>var(X). The speed of
adjustment can be as slow as we please. But as long as p is
close to unity, as it is empirically, var(Y) will be nearly as

large as var(X). In that case, only minor cost shocks are

Page 30

necessary to make var(Y) greater than var(X).

For example, in a numerical example with z1=.85, no cost

shocks, dc, b.013c, and a zero rate of interest,
var(Y)/var(X) is only 0.55 when Q=.9. But if P gets as high as
.98, var(Y)/var(X) rises to .95.

To summarize, a combination of a rapid speed of adjustment
(i.e., low z1) and high serial correlation in demand
disturbances (i.e., high P ) can leave var(Y) so close to var(X)

that it takes only very minor cost shocks to make var(Y) >
var(X).

7. Fact 2: Sales and Inventory Change Do Not Covary Negatively
The fact that cov(X,EN) is typically zero or positive is

the hardest to deal with, because conflicting factors produce
theoretically ambiguous results. The reader is spared the
detailed analysis. Suffice it to say that a positive cov(X,tN)

can be produced by cost shocks or by demand shocks that are
seen before sales decisions are made and that "build" before
decaying. Other types of demand shocks produce a negative

cov(X,N). Thus, cov(X,N) can have either sign, depending on
which types of shocks dominate.

8. The Stylized Facts: Summary

In summary, then, the production smoothing/buffer stock
model seems compatible with with all three facts mentioned in
the introduction under the following circumstances:

Page 31

(a) Cost shocks are present, though they need not be
large.

(b) Most demand shocks are seen by firms before they must
make their production and pricing decisions.

Cc) Demand shocks build before they decay. (ARMA(l,l) and
AR(2) processes are simple examples.)

Cd) Either the technology parameters dictate a rapid speed
of adjustment or demand disturbances have strong positive
A.

None of these requirements seem outlandish and, most

importantly, none forces us to jettison the basic idea that the

production function is concave. In this respect, then, the
production smoothing/buffer stock model is "saved," though with
rather little emphasis on the buffer stock aspects.

Page 32

IV. ECONOMETRIC INVENTORY EQUATIONS

This section presents econometric estimates of inventory
investment equations for finished goods based on the

theoretical specification (3.16). I concentrate on finished
goods because that is the only type of inventory for which we

have a coherent and operational theory. However, the stylized
facts show that works in progress are just as important.

The data are monthly, real, and seasonally adjusted, and
(after allowing for lags) span the period December 1960 — March
1981. <19> In accord with the findings in Section II, each

two—digit industry is treated separately. However, as a kind
of convenient summary, I also present results for all

manufacturing and for the durable and nondurable sectors. The
theoretical equation (3.16) was made operational as follows.
Demand disturbances were proxied by two variables:

expected sales, 4,

is

the one-period-ahead forecast from a

12—th order autoregressive fit to each industryvs actual data

on shipments; and unexpected sales, X, is the residual from
this autoregression. Thus expectations are assumed to be
"rational," albeit in a limited sense. Experimentation with
other expectational proxies led to substantially identical

results. In 13 of the 20 industries, data on new orders were

Page 33

available. For these industries, the collinearity between the
two sales measures was almost always too great to include both,

so two versions of the regressions were run. Normally, a better
fit was obtained using shipments.

Cost disturbances were treated by including both the real
product wage and the real cost of raw materials in each

earnings series specific to that industry or sector. The
nominal materials cost series was the PPI for Crude Materials
for Further Processing (and is the same for every industry).
Each nominal factor price was deflated by an industry— specific
price index.
In addition, the interest rate was included as a
potentially important determinant of the nonstochastic steady

state level of desired inventories. For reasons described in
Blinder (1981), the nominal interest rate (bank prime rate) and
the expected rate of inflation (generated by an autoregression)

were entered as separate variables rather than combined into a
real interest rate.

Before presenting the estimates, a word on autocorrelation

is in order. It has been well known for years that econometric
procedures have a hard time distinguishing between partial

adjustment and autocorrelation (Griliches (1967)). Write the
basic stock adjustment model of inventory change as:

(4.1) Nt÷i - Nt =

(N

—

Nt) + Ut

Variables other than Nt are irrelevant for present purposes,

Page 34
and

hence

ignored. If the error term follows an AR(i) scheme:
(4.2)

u =

P

ut_i

+ e '

the natural procedure is to quasi—difference (4.1) before
estimating to get:
(4.3)

= (P — + l)Nt —

P(l_8)Nti

+ e.

This is an AR(2) model for the stock of inventories. But

ntt-r th fnnimn1-1

are approximately equal, then the two coefficients in (4.3) are
approximately 1 and —l). Hence, we cannot tell

from l—.

For example, if either P= =.9 orP .l,. then the coefficients
in (4.3) are respectively 1.0 and —.09. Thus any estimation
technique will have trouble distinguishing between a model with
strong serial correlation and fast adjustment and one with
little serial correlation but slow adjustment. <20>
All the equations reported in this section were fit by
nonlinear least squares under the assumption that the error

term was AR(1). <21> In several cases, two local minima of the

sum of squared residuals function were found. In such cases,
one of the minima always had high p and rapid adjustment while
the other had low p and slow adjustment, precisely as suggested

by this simple argument. This point is important because the
extremely high adjustment speeds recently found by Maccini and
Rosanna (1984) result from an estimation technique that, I
believe, settles on the local minimum with high p . The

estimation method used here typically shows that the low p
solution is the global minimum.

The model in

Section

III recognized the existence of only

one type of inventory. But, in fact, there are three types and,
in many industries, also backlogs of unfilled orders.

Preliminary regressions showed clearly that investment in
finished goods inventories reacts differently to the initial
stock of each kind of inventories, so Table 4 presents
estimates of the following extended stock adjustment model of
finished goods inventories:

assumed to be generated by (4.2). (In the table, t—ratios

are in parentheses. Asterisks indicate variables for which
distributed lags were found to be significant, as will be
explained later.)

First, note that the initial stock of finished goods
always enters with a significant negative coefficient,

indicative of partial adjustment. However, in accord with much
previous work (see Fact 3), most of the estimated speeds of
adjustment are rather slow. among the 17 industries for which
the "low p" solution was the global minimum, the speeds of
adjustment range from 5% to 38% per month. These speeds are
slightly faster than those typically found in work at a more
aggregative level, but are not out of line with earlier
estimates. <22> In this context it is interesting to observe

that aggregation seems to bias the speed of adjustment

downward. The estimated adjustment speeds for durables and
nondurables as a whole are lower than those of most of the
constituent industries.

In the remaining three industries ——
and

textiles

solution,

—-

instruments,

food,

the global minimum turned out to be the "high

and estimated adjustment speeds were very rapid

(104%, 79%, and 100% per month, respectively).

The cross—adjustment coefficients,

and 31 are more

novel and display a rather consistent pattern across

industries. High opening stocks of either works in progress
(Wt) or raw materials (Mt) usually are associated with higher

investment in finished goods inventories, that is, with higher
production. Whether or not this empirical regularity implies
causation, of course, is another matter entirely. For example,
higher planned production could induce stockpiling of works in
progress and materials.

Studies that merge all three types of inventory into a
single stock necessarily produce an estimated "adjustment
speed" that is an amalgam of the three adjustment coefficients,
Since one of these is negative and the other two are
positive, we should expect this procedure to understate the
speed of adjustment if the three types of inventories covary
positively. To test this idea, a version of (4.4) was run in
which all three types of inventory were lumped together into a
single aggregate. The results were as expected: estimated

Page 37

adjustment speeds generally declined, sometimes dramatically.
Turning to specifics, the coefficient of works in progress
is positive in 17 of 20 industries, though it is significantly

positive in only 4 of these. The petroleum refining industry
is the only important exception to this rule; here, hIgh stocks
of work in progress apparently lead to lower levels of output.
The coefficient of the opening stock of materials and
supplies inventory is positive in 18 of 20 industries, and is

significantly positive in 10 of these. The only exceptions are
the primary metals and transportation equipment industries,

where high levels of raw materials apparently lead to cutbacks
in production.

In contrast to these rather good results, the stock of
unfilled orders performed poorly. Ainong the 13 industries

reporting data on unfilled orders, the estimated coefficient
was positive. 7 times (the "correct" sign, it seems to me) and

negative 6 times. Only three coefficients were significant; and
they were all negative.

As noted already, sales were measured alternatively by
shipments and, in those industries offering such data, unfilled
orders. Fortunately, the estimated equations proved quite
insensitive to the choice of a sales measure. Since shipments

performed slightly better than new orders, and are available
for all industries, Table 4 reports only the results with
shipments. <23>

In general, results for the sales variables were somewhat

Page 38

disappointing and not always in line with a priori
expectations. For example, many of the coefficients were
insignificantly different from zero, suggesting either that

production reacts virtually one—for—one to sales (whether
expected or unexpected) or that the difference between
production and sales shows up mostly in works in progress
rather than in finished goods. <24>

Specifically, the coefficient of expected sales,X ,

is

normally quite small (values of .05 or less are typical) and

insignificantly different from zero. Its sign is positive in
14 cases and negative in 6, and only 8 of the 20 industries
(all in durables) display significant coefficients.

The unexpected sales variable is significant in only 7
industries. A positive coefficient for this variable is
impossible to interpret in the context of the model; taken
literally, it implies that inventories of finished goods rise
when there is an unexpected surge in sales. Presumably, a
positive coefficient means that the sales fluctuations which we
label "unexpected" are really expected by firms, in accord with
the discussion in Section III. Yet the point estimate is
positive in 11 of 20 industries. There is evidence of a strong

negative effect of X on LFt in only 6 industries.
Interest rates, represented here by the (monthly) nominal
interest rate (Rt) and the (monthly) industry—specific expected
rate of inflation ( Fit) do not perform as the theory suggests.

The expected signs are negative for Rt and positive for

but

Page 39

only 4 of 20 industries display this pattern. Taking the two
variables individually, we see that Rt gets the expected
negative coefficent in only 10 of 20 cases and

gets the

expected positive coefficient in only 9 of 20 cases. Only 5 of
the 19 correctly—signed coefficients are significant; as are 5

of the 21 incorrectly—signed coefficients. This is not much
better than what you would expect if the coefficients were
randomly distributed around zero, so the overall conclusion
seems to be that interest rates do not matter. This finding is
consistent with older empirical work on inventory investment,

but contradictory to some newer work in which significant
inventory effects have been found. <25>

The wage rate is probably the least successful variable of
all. Of the 20 industries, only 4 estimates get the expected
negative sign. Of the 16 positive coefficients, 9 are
significantly different from zero. The results here strongly
suggest reverse causation running from higher production to
higher wages, perhaps due to overtime premia. Thus, I conclude
that wage rates are not good representations of cost shocks.
Raw materials costs are far more successful in this role.

The estimated coefficient of c is negative in 15 of 20 cases,
and is significant in about half the industries. And many of

the coefficients are of an economically meaningful size. For
example, the coefficient for all manufacturing indicates that a

10% rise in raw materials prices (the variable c is an index
number with January 1972=100) will lower the desired stock of

Page 40

finished goods inventories by $2 billion (in 1972 dollars), or
about 5% of the mean inventory stock.

Finally, I note in passing that the fits of the
regressions —— as measured by R2 —— are modest at best. Time

series analysis of noisy, virtually trendless series like A

Ft

encourages humility.

One objection to the standard stock adjustment model is
that it assumes that all the righthand variables enter only

contemporaneously. But if there are lags in adjustment,
noncontemporaneous values of variables like interest rates and
raw materials costs may also matter. <26> In fact, Irvine
(1981c) has argued that omission of such variables may bias

estimated adjustment speeds downward. There are so many
possible combinations of distributed lags that might be added
to (4.4) that I adopted a sequential search procedure to

economize on computing costs. The results are summarized in
Table 5.

First, I tested for whether expectations of sales more
than one month ahead contribute anything to the explanation of
inventory change by adding

+2' and

to the

regression. <27> Column (1) of Table 5 reports the appropriate
likelihood ratio tests, showing that these additional variables
were significant in 8 of the 20 industries. <28> However,
adding these variables to the regression led to a meaningful
change in the estimated adjustment speed in only two
industries. One of these (miscellaneous manufacturing) jumped

from the "low p" solution to the "high p" solution, with a
correspondingly large increase in the estimated speed of

adjustment. <29>
In the second step, expectations of future sales were
retained in these 8 industries, but dropped in the other 12,

and I

tested for the effects of lagged interest rates by

appropriate likelihood ratios. <30> Column (2) reports the

results.

Lagged interest rates proved to be significant in 7

industries. Inspection of the results shows that it was usually
the lagged values of Rt, not of

,

that

obtained significant

coefficients. While several estimated adjustment speeds'changed
in this step, there was no clear pattern —— some increased
while others decreased.
In the next step, the lagged values of interest rates were

retained in the 7 industries in which they proved to be
significant, but dropped in the remaining 13, and I tested for
the inclusion of lagged raw materials prices. The results of
the likelihood ratio tests are reported in column (3) of Table
2

5. The X value is significant in 4 xndustries but, with one

exception, inclusion of lagged c had only minor effects on the
estimates of p and l• <31> The exception was miscellaneous
manufacturing, which returned to the "low p" solution.
The last step was to retain lagged materials costs in

these 4 sectors, drop them from the remaining 16, and go on to

look for significant effects of lagged wages. <32> Lagged
wages proved to be significant in only two industries, and did

Page 42

not change the estimates of p and

substantially in either

case.

Table 6 reports the end results of this search procedure
for each industry and aggregate in which at least one
significant distributed lag effect was found. Once a final

specification was selected, the computing algorithm was started
from different initial points to see if it would converge to a
different local minimum in the sum of squared residuals
function. This never happened. Among the 20 industries, only
food jumped from one local minimum to another between Tables 4
and 6. Consequently, in the end only two industries are
estimated to have rapid adjustment speeds (instruments and
textiles) and severely autocorrelated disturbances. The
remaining 18 have adjustment speeds ranging from 5% to 38% per

month and autocorrelation parameters ranging from —.21 to +.32.
However, it is worth reemphasizing that our ability to pin down
the speed of adjustment is not nearly so good as the
t—statistic indicates. <33>
Comparing Tables 4 and 6. shows that —-

except in the one

case in which the global minimum shifts from one local minimum
to another ——
any

notable

the

inclusion of distributed lags does not have

effects on the estimated speed of adjustment.

Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down, but it never

changes dramatically. The same is more or less true of the
coefficients of the other three stock variables: no dramatic,

or even terribly systematic, changes in coefficients were

observed.

For each of the other variables, Table 6 reports the
coefficient of the contemporaneous value and the sum of the

remaining coefficients. The few systematic changes that can be
observed in going from Table 4 to Table 6 are easily
summarized:

EXPECTED SALES: In the 8 industries in which future
expected sales were significant, there was a clear tendency for
the contemporaneous coefficient to change in the negative
direction when future expected values were added.
INTEREST RATES: The distributed lag specification
typically yielded larger (in absolute value) coeffients for
both nominal rates and expected inflation than the simpler
specifications in Table 4. In the case of nominal rates, the
coefficients of current and lagged interest rates typically
were of opposite sign. While this suggestion of intertemporal
substitution (temporarily high rates lead to temporary
inventory

liquidation) is tantalizing, it is easy to resist

given the imprecision of the estimates.
MATERIALS COSTS: In those few cases in which lagged

materials prices were significant, the coefficient of current
price was usually positive while the sum of the coefficients of
past prices was negative.
In general, however, the results in Table 6 do not change
the overall impression left by Table 4, although the
regressions with distributed lags generally fit better.

V. CONCLUSION

It is easy enough to see why the production smoothing
model looks so bad at first blush. Consider a trivially simple
fixed— price macro model of aggregate supply and demand based
.I_ 1._

..

+ IX

Supply:.

Y=

Demand:

X=X+e,

where Y is production and X is sales. Here e is. the random

demand shock that drives the model and I<l captures the idea
that production is smoothed relative to sales.

In this model, var(Y)/var(X) =

2,

which is certainly less

than unity. Further, since inventory change is:

= Y — X

= + (—l)X+

(-l)e,

it is clear that X and EN are perfectly negatively correlated
in the model. In the data, as we know, var(Y) exceeds var(X)
and X and tN are nearly orthogonal. The contradiction between
the model and reality could hardly be more complete.
This paper has shown, however, that it is possible to
amend the production smoothing model in ways that make it

consistent with the facts. Section 111.8 summarized how this

can be done. The two critical ingredients are serially
persistent demand disturbances of a particular type and the
addition of a cost shock.

Page 45
It is easy to see how these amendments help. Adding a
cost shock changes the model to:
Supply:

Y =

+ 3x + u

Demand: X=X+e,
and Section III showed that, for any given cost structure,
serial correlation in demand disturbances has the effect of

pushing

towards unity. Assuming that u is independent of e at

all lags, trivial calculations establish that:

var(Y)/var(X) =

corr(X,
where

N) =

2+T2
2 -

Cr +(l—B) ]2

is the ratio var(u)/var(e). Now, if

is big enough,

the variance ratio can exceed unity; and the correlation
between X and AN, while still negative, can at least be small.
This, in essence, is now Section III attempts to reconcile
the production smoothing model with the data. Furthermore, the
econometric estimates of inventory equations in Section IV are
broadly consistent with the theoretical reconciliation in that
(a) the stochastic processes describing demand are highly

autocorrelated, (b) the estimated adjustment speeds are quite
low, and Cc) econometric proxies for unexpected sales appear
not to be unexpected by firms. At some level, therefore, the
exercise must be judged a success. The production smoothing
model, or at least the concavity of the production function,
has been saved.

Yet there are some lingering doubts. A skeptic may recall

Page 46

that Ptolemaic astronomy was "saved" many times by the addition
of epicycles specifically designed to accommodate each new
fact. In addition, many features of the econometric estimates
are less than satisfactory, including the tenuous basis for
pinning down the adjustment speed parameters, the previously—
noted fact that slow adjustment is hard to explain, and the
poor results obtained with key variables like unexpected sales,

and interest rates. One suspects that Copernicus may be
waiting in the wings.
Certainly there are other models of inventory behavior
that might be used to explain the stylized facts. For example,
the (S,s) model was mentioned in Section I, but judged
implausible on a priori grounds. <34> But perhaps the
wages,

explanation

for the puzzling behavior of inventories does not

in inventory behavior at all. To see what I mean, consider
the following trivial "Keynesian cross" model in which demand
creates its own supply and inventories never change:
lie

Supply:

Y = X

Demand:

X=a+bY+e.

Obviously, in this model var(Y)/var(X)=1. And

since

there are

no changes in inventories, var(tN)O and cov(X,tN)O in a
trivial sense. Clearly, this model cannot be quite right
because it ignores some empirically important movements in
inventories. Nonetheless, it makes a promising start at
"explaining" the first three stylized facts enumerated in
Section I.

Page 47

It does not take much imagination to integrate the

Keynesian specification of aggregate demand with the production
smoothing model of aggregate supply to get:
Supply:

Y =

+ X + U,

ci.

Demand: Xa+bY+e.
In this hybrid model, the critical variance ratio is:
var(Y) =
var(X)

var(u)+ 2var(e)
2

b var(u)+ var(e)

This expression clearly shows that demand shocks lead to a
variance ratio smaller than 1 (depending on the degree of
production smoothing) while supply shocks lead to a variance
ratio bigger than 1 (depending on the MPC). The variance ratio
will exceed 1 if and only if:
2
T

>

1-b

If

2

is larger than b, this may not require large cost shocks.
The covariance between sales and inventory change is:
cov(X,N) =

b(1-b)var(u) -

(l-b)

2

(1—)var(e)
—

which can have either sign —— an empirically pleasing

given the mixed results in the data.
Thus it would appear that attaching a Keynesian

prediction,

demand

side to our production- smoothing supply side may help the

latter account for the stylized facts. Metzler probably knew
this forty years ago.

FOOTNOTES

1. See, for example, Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon (1960).
2. Lovell (1961) began this tradition, and many have followed.
3. For a precise derivation, see Blinder (1982).

4. For the period 1947:2—1981:1 (quarterly data), Blinder
(1981, p. 446) reports that the variance of real GNP around
trend is 32% larger than the variance of real final sales
around trend.
5. See Blinder (1981).

6. The time period is obviously crucial here. If the period is
a day, for example, it is clear that inventories will serve
primarily as buffer stocks whether or not they are held for
this purpose. The data I use are monthly.
7. This problem was noticed by Orr (1967), and received
prominent attention from Carison and Wehrs (1974) and from
Feldstein and Auerbach (1976).
8. In intermediate position was suggested to me by Geoffrey
Heal. It is possible that the production function is convex at
low output levels and then becomes concave. This is
consistent, for example, with the U—shaped cost curves of
elementary textbooks.
9. Alternatively, we could count a portion of a and a portion
of d as production. This leads to more cumbersome accounting
identities.

10. In doing this, data on inventory stocks were adjusted to
ref lect the fact that one dollar of inventory stock represents
more physical units than one dollar of shipments because
inventories are valued at cost rather than market. Part of the
appropriate adjustment to convert the data from real values
into physical units is presented and explained by West (1983b).
The rest is described in Blinder and Holt—Eakin (1983). The
adjustment has the effect of making the variances of y and n
larger than they appear in the raw data. However, var(y)
exceeded var(x) in 18 of the 20 idustries (plus all three
aggregates) even before the adjustments were made.
11. However, detrending by ordinary least squares led to very
similar results, as did entirely different detrending
procedures.
12. Since each series was detrended independently, and in logs,

Page 49
the identity (1.2) does not hold exactly even though (1.1)
does.

13. For these comparisons, it was thought that data on (real)
dollar values were more meaningful than physical quantities, so
the adjustment mentioned in footnote 10 was not made.
14. By contrast, a breakdown of real final sales into
consumption, fixed investment, government purchases, and net
exports reported in Blinder (1981, P. 448) shows that the sum
of the variances of the components is 80% larger than the
variance of final sales (the covariances are pervasively
negative). For retail sales, the picture is more similar to
manufacturing: the individual variances account for 39% of the
overall variance.
15. The latter is the case dealt with in Blinder (1982).

16. This statement summarizes succinctly the main point of
Blinder (1982).
17. In the case of a v demand shock wh.ich is unknown to the
firm when it makes its production decision, the ratio
var(X)/var(Y) - (l+(d/c)) + (d/c) > 1 as z 0. If d is much
smaller than c, this will not exceed 1 by much.
18. This proposition does not apply to a V2 demand shock which
is unknown to the firm when it makes its poduction decision.
If demand shocks are of this type, var(X)/var(Y) exceeds 1 even
as p approaches 1.

19.Had they been available, I would have preferred to use data
that were not seasonally adjusted, since the production
smoothing model presumably applies to seasonal fluctuations in
sales. However, such data are not available.
20. Since there are other regressors in (4.1), it is not
impossible to distinguish between the two models. But it is
difficult.

21. Experiments with more complicated error structures bore
little fruit.
22. Feldstein and Auerbach (1976), for example, reported
adjustment speeds between 5% and 7% per quarter for finished
goods inventories in durable manufacturing. This was fairly
typical of work up to that time. Auerbach and Green (1980) got
much faster adjustment speeds (from 12% to 85% per quarter)
using data on four two-digit industries and a model that
treated finished goods and works in progress separately.
Blanchard's (1983) study of the divisions of U.S. auto firms
found adjustment speeds ranging from 0% to 35% per month.
Finally, Maccini and Rossana (1984) found very fast adjustment

Page 50

speeds (62% to 96% per month).
23. A few cases in which new orders proved to be significant
are given in Table 6 below.

X F

=
24. Recall that Y change when X rises either

+ W , so if F +1 does not
muse rise or f1 must fall.

25. The earlier literature, summarized, e.g., by Irvine (1981a)
found little evidence for a significant effect of interest
costs on inventory holdings. However, recent work by Irvine
(198la, 198lb) has detected such effects for retailers and
merchant wholesalers, while Rubin (1980) and Akhtar (1983) have
found aggregate inventories to be interest sensitive. Only
Lieberinan (1980), using micro data on a small sample of firms
and a specially— constructed cost of capital variable, has
found any evidence for interest sensitivity in manufacturing.
26. For example, in the discussion following Blinder (1981)
Benjamin Friedman justifiably criticized my work on retail
inventories for this reason, and suggested that adjustment
speeds might be faster if distributed lags were allowed for.

27. All expectations were based on the information set
available for period t (that is, data from period t-l and
earlier). Since expeàtations are generated by a pure
autoregression, each future expectation, like Xe
is
simply a linear combination of lagged X's. Theteffect of
adding future expectations is thus simply to loosen the
constraints on how past X's affect current inventory
investment.

itself,

28. The three distributed lead coefficients were constrained to
fall along a straight line, reducing the number of paraeters
to be estimated from three to two. Thus the relevant x
statistic has two degrees of freedom. The critical values are
5.99 at the 5% level and 9.21 at the 1% level.
29. In these regressions, I also tried using current and
expected future new orders in the 13 industries for which such
data were available. These variables rarely were significant.
30. In dealing with interest rates, R
and
were always
treated symmetrically. For each variable, lags ranging from 1
to 11 months were allowed in the regression, with the lag
coefficients constrained to fall along a straight line. Hence,
the hypothesis that lagged interest rates do not ente imposes
four zero restrictions. The critical points of the x
distribution are 9.49 at the 5% level and 13.3 at the 1% level.

31. In dealing with materials costs, 11 months was again
assumed to be the longest lag and lag coefficients were
constrained to fall along a quadratic. Hence the relevant

Page 51
statistic has three degrees of freedom. The 5% critical point
is 7.81 and the 1% critical point is 11.3.

32. For wages a linear lag shape was assumed, so the null
hypothesis that lagged wages have no effect imposes two zero
restrictions. As before, the longest ag was assumed to be 11
months. The critical points for the x are 5.99 at 5% and 9.21
at 1%.

33. For example, if we constrain =1 (by estimating the
equation in first— difference form), estimated adjustment
•speeds are extremely high; indeed, many are above 100%.
34. However, the technological assumption mentioned in
8 is not implausible, and is worth exploring.
