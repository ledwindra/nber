We use this framework to analyze the welfare implications of trading blocs among countries with different endowments with and without transportation costs.      In this framework, we address the following issues: a) the welfare implications of the consolidation of the world into a few trading blocs; b) the different incentives that rich and poor countries have in choosing their partners in trade arrangements; c) whether the welfare consequences of continental preferential trade arrangements depend on the relative endowments.\n\n",
