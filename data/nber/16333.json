    "abstract": "\n\nPolicymakers and academics are increasingly interested in applying financial incentives to individuals in education.  This paper presents evidence from a pay for performance program taking place in Coshocton, Ohio.  Since 2004, Coshocton has provided cash payments to students in grades three through six for successful completion of their standardized testing.  Coshocton determined eligibility for the program using randomization, and using this randomization, this paper identifies the effects of the program on students' academic behavior. We find that math scores improved about 0.15 standard deviations but that reading, social science, and science test scores did not improve.\n\n",
