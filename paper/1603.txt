Real Aspects of Exchange Rate Regime
Choice with Collapsing Fixed Rates

ABSTRACT

Typical evaluations of the choice of exchange rate regime employ a

criterion function that depends on the real performance of the econoir, and
they

focus on regimes that are expected to last indefinitely. This latter

feature Is strongly contradicted by the transitory nature of actual regimes.
This paper extends the recent literature on collapses of fixed exchange rate
regimes with exogenous real sectors to examine how the predictions of two
popular models for the determination of some real economic variables must be
modified when agents rationally perceive that the fixed rate regime will be

transitory. The models studied are simple stochastic versions of the models
In Dornbusch (1976) and Flood and Marion (1982).

—3-Typical evaluations of the performance of an economy under alternative
exchange rate regimes proceed under the assumption that exchange—rate regimes
last forever. 1 This assumption is a gross contradiction of the fact that

exchange rate regimes are actually quite transitory. Countries never really
followed the •rules of the game" .under the Gold Standard, and it evolved into

the Gold Exchange Standard. During the Great Depression currencies became
inconvertible. The Bretton Woods system was planned as a system of fixed
exchange rates, but it was recognized that countries would devalue and revalue

their currencies when in "fundamental disequlibrium". Although this term was
never formally defined, countries did devalue and revalue their currencies,

often by large amounts, during the two decades preceding the breakdown of the
system in 1971.

The purpose of this paper is to reexamine the determination of real
output in two popular models of the open economy accounting explicitly for the

transitory nature of fixed exchange rate regimes. Rational agents understand
that an exchange—rate regime may be temporary, and they incorporate
expectations of the collapse of the regime and its associated capital gains or

losses into their behavioral functions. The models we examine are simple
stochastic versions of the Dorubush (1976) model of exchange rate dynamics
with flexible output and the Flood and Marion (1982) model of wage indexatiori

in an open economy. We work with simplified versions of these models since
our point is that some of the implications of the models are drastically
altered when we allow agents to act on their understanding of regime

impermanence. These alterations are robust to more complex versions of the
models, but since we are presenting some counterexamples, model complexity

only obscures our points. Our work builds on previous research on the
temporary nature of government policies including Salant and Henderson (1978),
Krugman (1979), Flood and Garber (1983, 1984) and Flood and Marion (1983).

—4—
In Section 2

of

the paper we develop our version of the Dornbusch

model. For some configurations of the model, we demonstrate that the regime
of permanently floating exchange rates always produces a higher unconditional
variance of output than does a regime of permanently fixed exchange rates.
This result is confirmed when we consider a temporary fixed—rate regime,

although we find the disadvantage of a floating—rate regime diminishes as the

possibility of an attack on a fixed rate regime rises. This result is an
unsurpr1sng extension of the original comparison between fixed and flexible
exchange rates. What is surprising to us, however, is that output variance
conditional on maintaining a fixed—rate regime which may collapse can be

higher than output variance under floating rates. Intuitively, this measure
of the conditional variance of real output corresponds to the sample or
measured output variance during a fixed exchange rate regime that has not
collapsed.

Our examination of the wage indexing model is presented in Section 3. It
is well known that optimal wage indexation depends on the stochastic structure
of the underlying economy, and a contribution of Flood and Marion (1982) was
to demonstrate that the degree of wage indexation would not be invariant to
the country's choice of exchange—rate regime.

In their analysis, different

permanent exchange rate regimes lead to different optimal wage indexing
polices, and each policy is a fixed function of the time invariant stochastic

structure of the economy. In this paper we discuss fixed exchange rate
regimes which may collapse, and we find that the optimal degree of wage

indexation is state dependent and thus time varying even though the stochastic
structure of the economy is time invariant.

—5—
Our

results

are presented in the next two sections. For each type of

model we first examine permanent exchange rate regimes turning then to a
characterization of the economy when a fixed exchange rate regime may possibly

collapse. In each model we take the domestic credit component of the money
supply to be an exogenous process. This creates an inherent tension between
the two government policies, the domestic credit process and the fixed

exchange rate regime, which is resolved by the collapse of the regime. This
appears to capture the actual priorities of governments without modeling the

objective function of the monetary and fiscal authorities. Presumably, one
reason why the domestic credit process has priority is because of the
seignorage gained by the government from printing money.2
Because algebraic complexity quickly renders complex versions of each
type of model analytically intractable, we worked with simple stripped down
versions of each type of model while attempting to retain the essential

economic aspects of the problems. Some of the derivations of various results
are presented in a techical appendix to facilitate presentation of the
results.

2k. A DORNBUSCH-TYPE MODEL

The original

Dornbusch (1976) model depicted a medium-size open economy

that was large in the market for goods produced at home and small in world

asset markets. The crucial feature of the model was that domestic currency
prices of domestic goods were predetermined while the country's exchange rate
and other asset prices were currently determined and free to respond to all

current shocks. This feature gave rise to the famous overshooting result.
Since home goods prices were predetermined, the immediate response of the
exchange rate to a money—market disturbance had to be larger than that

response would have been had all prices been free to adjust. We use a version

of the model that makes output demand determined. It consists of the
following relations:

The demand for money depends negatively on the opportunity cost of holding
money, the nominal interest rate, and it depends positively on the real demand

for home goods, d. The equilibrium condition for the world capital market is
given in equation (2) by the uncovered interest rate parity condition. The
demand for domestic output is specified in equation (3). Demand for home
goods depends negatively on the logarithm of the relative price of home goods

is expected to clear the market for domestic goods by equating expected demand
to full employment output, y.

Actual output in period t is determined by the

demand for it given the predetermined variables h and h. The composition of

the

money supply is given by equation (5). The nominal mony supply is

composed of a domestic credit component and an tnternational reserves

component. Equation (6) states that the rate of

growth of domestic credit,

SOLUTIONS FOR PERMANENT EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES

When exchange rates are perfectly flexible, there is rio intervention in
the foreign exchange market implying that rt is the constant .

A solution

for the exchange rate can be found by recognizing that the variables on the
right—hand side of (8) completely describe the current state of the system.
Consequently, the linearity of the model allows us to apply the method of

If the exchange rate is permanently fixed at a level s and the government
runs an exogenous domestic credit process, then rt becomes endogenous.

International reserves adjust during the period to equate the demand for money

and the supply of money. Under a permanently fixed exchange rate regime, s =

and the conditional variance of output is simply

v_i(y)ipi =

By comparing (9) and (10), one sees that the conditional variance of real

of real output under a fixed rate regime whenever

(11)

Because the flexible exchange rate regime allows foreign price and interest
rate disturbances and the domestic money supply disturbance to affect the
exchange rate thereby altering the terms of trade, these disturbances add
additional variance to the demand for and supply of real output under such a

regime. A counterbalancing effect that tends to reduce the volatility of real
output under flexible rates when compared to fixed rates is that positive real
demand shocks appreciate the domestic currency thereby improving the terms of
trade, and this change in relative prices reduces the demand for real

output. The appreciation of the currency arises because the increase in real

— 11 —
demand increases the demand for money. The smaller is the elasticity of the

demand for money with respect to real output, y, the more likely is the

volatility of real output to be greater under flexible exchange rates than

under fixed rates. In order to provide a striking comparison in what follows,
we assume that y =

0.

With this change, permanently flexible rates produce

an unambiguously larger volatility of real output than permanently fixed
exchange rates.

2C.

SOLUTION FOR A TEMPORARY FIXED EXCHANGE RATE REGIME

Our fixed exchange rate solution from the previous section ignored the
possibility that the economy may evolve into a state where it is worthwhile
for agents to attack the government's foreign exchange reserves and end the

fixed rate regime.4 We assume that the monetary authority will defend the
fixed rate regime only until its reserves hit some known lower bound, r.

After reserves hit this bound, the netary authority is assumed to abandon
the fixed—rate regime forever, If agents successfully attack the fixed—rate
regime, they produce the floating rate whose level is given by

< s, attackers would make losses and consequently

would not attack. If an atack took place when s s, no profits would be
realized, and the post—attack exchange rate would be s.

Thus, we treat this

case as part of the no attack situation without loss of generality, and an

attack takes place if and only if s >

— 12 —

At time t-1, when setting nominal prices for period t, agents realize
that the fixed exchange rate regime could collapse next period. Therefore,
the conditional expectation of the exchange rate in period t is not simply
s, but it is the probability weighted average of the conditional expectations
under the two possible regimes:

which is clearly larger than Vt...1(yt)Fjx. It is also true that

This

demonstrates that a regime of collapsing fixed rates has a more volatile real

—14-output than a regime of permanently fixed rates, but the volatility is not
larger than under a pure flexible rate regime.

These results are not particularly surprising since as cSi increases,
the probability of an attack decreases, and the conditional variance of output

approaches that under a fixed exchange rate regimen Similarly, as
decreases, the probability of an attack increases, and the conditional
variance of real output approaches that under a flexible exchange rate

regime. For intermediate values of 5t1' the conditional variance iS between
the two extreme regimes.

The conditional variance used in the above comparisons takes into account

An alternative way

and NCt (

to examine the volatility of output under a potentially collapsing fixed
exchange rate regime is to estimate the variance of output by examining only
the realizations of output under a *egime that could collapse but had not

collapsed during the sample. This corresponds to the sample variance that one
would measure by using all the data during a regime of fixed rates up to the
point of a collapse.

In order to conduct an analytical comparison of (17) and (15b), it is

nessary to consider an actual probability distribution for c. Analytical
tractablity also rules out obvious candidates like the normal distribution,
but the point of the analysis is to demonstrate that the squared exchange rate
forecast error in (17) can be greater than the one in (15b) for some

Consequently, we examined the model under the hypotheses that

had either a uniform distribution or a double exponential probability

This result is due entirely to the fact that exchange rate prediction

A FLOOD-MARION TYPE MODEL
One version of the Flood—Marion (1982) model depicted an open economy

that was small both in the market for goods and in the market for assets.
Wage contracts were set one period in advance of the realizations of

disturbances. Wages, however, werelndexed to the price level in a manner to
minimize the deadweight loss from wages being different than their level in a

frictionless (no contract) economy.6 rhe major result of Flood and Marion was
that the degree of wage indexation depended on the choice of exchange—rate

regime. They found that a small open economy would index wages fully under a
regime of permanently fixed exchange rates, but wages would only be indexed

partially under a regime of floating exchange rates. Their results indicated
that the degree of wage indexing would remain constant under any single regime
as long as the underlying stochastic structure of the economy was constant.
In our version of the Flood—Marion model, the fixed exchange rate regime
may collapse. Hence, wages are not fully indexed for such a regime, and the
degree of indexation is time varying even though the underlying exogenous
stochastic structure is time invariant.

—18—
We demonstrate this result in a stripped—down version of the Flood—Marion
model consisting of the following relations:

tractable, we simplified the money demand function, removing from the Flood—
Marion model the opportunity cost of holding money as well as the portion of

output that is responsive to prices. Money demand thus depends only on a

constant, , and the productivity disturbance, ut. The qualitative properties
of our results do not depend on these simplifications, but they enormously

simplify some later calculations. Equation (22) gives the goods arbitrage
condition, which is equivalent to prchasing power parity in this one—good
model. Equation (23), which is derived in the Appendix of Flood and Marion,
is the aggregate supply function. The variable z is proportional to one minus
the optimal degree to which the nominal wage is indexed to the price level.
Since z is a deterministic linear function of the degree of indexing, the
optimal wage contract may be found by minimizing the loss function (given

below) with respect to z. Equation (24), which is also derived in the
Appendix of Flood and Marion, gives the frictionless benchmark (no indexing)
level of output,

Equation (25) specifies that the money supply is

composed of domestic credit, which we hold constant, and international

reserves. As specified in equation (26), the foreign price follows a random

simplified version of the model. In general, the optimal z will depend on the
relative sizes of the variances of the various shocks (see Flood and Marion,

When the exchange rate is permanently fixed, rt becomes demand

fixed exchange rate. In this circumstance the domestic price prediction
error, Pt —

is simply the prediction error of foreign prices,

Consequently, since v and Ut are uncorrelated, the solution to (29) is

to set z1 =

0 to screen foreign price disturances out of the domestic loss

function. This is exactly the resurt in Flood and Marion.

SOLUTION FOR A TEMPORARY FIXED EXCHANGE RATE REGIME
The fixed—rate solution in the previous section presumed that the fixed—

rate regime would last forever. As before, however, for some configurations
of the state variables of the economy it may be profitable for agents to
attack the government?s stock of foreign exchange reserves and end the fixed—

rate regime. We continue to assume that the monetary authority will defend
the fixed rate only until international reserves hit some known lower bound,
r, and that after hitting this bound, the fixed—rate regime wiil be abandoned

forever in favor of a flexible exchange rate regime. In this model, if agents
attack the fixed rate, they will produce the floating rate given by

As before, when there is a possibility that the exchange rate regime will

collapse, the agents take account of the possibility in determining their

contractual relations. In this case, the optimal degree of indexing depends
on the probability of the collapse because this affects the unconditional time
t—1 covariance and variance in (29).

information.

In typical wage indexing models the optimal z is a time invariant

function of the variances and covariances of the underlying disturbances. Our
main point in this section is that it will not in general be time invariant

when stochastic process switching is possible. This point can be seen at an
intuitive level by examining (31) and noticing that z_1 depends on

the

state dependent probability at t—1 of an attack at t.

To make additional progress concerning z1, we again made specific

assumptions about the probability distribution functions for v and u• In
the Appendix we assume that the orthogonal disturbances v and u are each
uniformly distributed on the interval [—n,rl].

This assumption leads to the

closed form but complicated expression for zi shown in the Appendix. Since
the final expression for z_1 is so complicated, we simulated it for a few
values of

in the interval [—2n,O], and we set n = 1.

screening all foreign disturbances out of the loss function. For larger
values of

such as —1 and 0 in examples 32b) and (32c), an attack is

possible and contracts written at t—1 allow for this contingency by setting
at optimal values between 0, the optimal value for a fixed exchange rate
with no attack possible, and X, the optimal value for a permanently floating
exchange rate.

—24—
The point of this simple example is to note that an economy's optimal
choice of wage indexation to the price level may not depend simply on the
policy currently being pursued by the government and the constant covariance

structure of exogenous disturbances. It may also depend on agents' rational
beliefs about the possibility of switches in government policies in the

future. Consequently, the observation that indexing in wage contracts is time
varying need not necessarily be associated with variation in the conditional
covariance matrix of the underlying exogenous disturbances, it may instead be
associated with time variation in agents' beliefs concerning the permanance of
currently implemented policies.7

CONCLUSIONS

The purpose of this paper was to examine how some aspects of the real
economy, such as the determination of output, relative prices and real wages,

are influenced by the potential collapse of a fixed exchange rate regime. We
examined the implications of the potential switch in government policies in

simple versions of two popular international macroeconomic models. In both
models, agents must take an action that predetermines some nominal variable.
Consequently, monetary policy and the choice of exchange rate regime have real

effects. In both models the monetary authority Is only willing to defend its
exchange rate until its reserves hit a known lower bound. In each case the
monetary authority also conducts an exogenous domestic credit policy. If the
authorities were willing to conduct an endogenous domestic credit policy,

there would be no need for internatioa1 reserves, and the probability of
collapse of the fixed exchange rate regime would be zero.

Clearly, one interesting area for future work is the linkage of the
domestic credit policy and the constraints imposed by the government budget

a

— 25 —

constraint

with the choice of exchange rate regime. Eaton (1984) has

investigated this problem in a neoclassical context with exogenous real
output.

Another interesting area for future work is to focus on devaluations as

opposed to the switch from fixed to flexible rates investigated here. What
determines the timing and magnitude of a devaluation? Blanco and Garber
(1984)

have

begun such an investigation.

We impose this additional restriction because the joint

FOOTNOTES

1Early contributions to the debate on fixed versus flexible exchange rates are

surveyed by Ishiyama (1975) and Tower and Willett (1976). Some of the
more recent analytical contributions to this area that are based on
rational expectations include Flood (1979), Lapan and Enders (1980),
Helpnian (1981), Weber (1981), Eaton (1982), Kimbrough (1983), Turnovsky
(1983), and Aizenman and Frenkel (1984).

2Fischer (1982) demonstrates that seignorage accounts for as much as ten

percent of total government revenue for countries such as Argentina and

Brazil. The literature on the monetary approach to the balance of
payments, e.g. Frenkel and Johnson (1975), was quite clear that a policy
of fixing the exchange rate made the total money supply endogenous.

3The Dornbusch model deflates nominal money balances by the domestic price of
the domestic good instead of deflating them by a price index composed of
the domestic price of domestic goods and the domestic price of foreign

goods. For our purposes this is a harmless simplification which we also
adopt.

4Although we examine only fixed and freely floating exchange rates, our

methods could easily encompass "crawling pegs" or any rule that makes the
fixed exchange rate a deterministic function of the previous state. Our
methods could also be extended to analyze a "dirty float" of the form

—

mi =

+

v,

such as that studied by Aizenman and Frenkel

(1984). In such a circumstance, while the private sector could not attack
the money printing rule, the fiscal authority might require a change in
the rule if it were to call for less money printing than were required for

deficit finance. The inability of Southern Cone countries to stay on
preannounced crawling peg schedules is perhaps an example of the type of

fiscal authority attack we have in mind. In such countries an exchange
rate policy seems not to be permanently viable unless it accomodates the
fiscal authority's revenue requirements.

- 36

-

5'rhe conditions we use for an attack are those in Flood and Garber (1984). An
alternative view, where the agents who would attack the price fixing
scheme are small and disorganized is proposed by Obstfeld (1984).

According to the Obstfeld view, s > s is necessary for an attack but not
always sufficient. The condition is necessary and sufficient in the
present model though, as Obstfeld (1984) has shown.

6lndexing wages to prices is motivated only by the large number of such

contracts actually implemented. The value of the loss function can
generally be made smaller if contracts include more complex indexing to

the state as in Karni (1983) or Aizenman and Frenkel (1984). Our intent,
however, is not to specify an ideal contract, but rather to indicate how
actual contracts affect the economy in a second best environment.

7Cecchetti (1984) derives and documents changes in an implied indexing
parameter for union wage changes from 1964—1978 for U. S. unionized

manufacturing. The movement in the parameter may be due to movement in
the conditional variance of the exogenous monetary and real processes of
the economy, but the analysis in this paper suggests that such movement
might also arise from agents' perceptions of the likelihood of switches in

government policies. Since the contracting paradigm also leads to the
aggregate supply curve studied by Lucas (1973), the perceived impermanence
of existing exchange rate regimes is an additional reason why the slope
parameters would differ across countries.
