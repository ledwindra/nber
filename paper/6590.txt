Managing Annual Accounting Reports to Avoid State Taxes:
An Analysis of Property-Casualty Insurers

I.

Introduction
This study extends our understanding of cross-jurisdictional tax planning by documenting

reporting patterns in insurers’ state annual accounting reports that are consistent with taxmotivated income shifting. Specifically, our findings are consistent with property-casualty
insurers avoiding state taxes through strategically allocating premiums and losses across the
statutory reports they file with each state in which they operate. Although the paper’s primary
inference—that companies shift tax bases across jurisdictions through allocations of income and
expenses among commonly-controlled companies—is similar to ones drawn from extant studies,
its superior data enable a more powerful analysis of income shifting than has been previously
possible. In addition, this paper is one of the first to identify the accounts through which income
is shifted to avoid taxes.
Many prior studies (e.g., Klassen, et al. 1993; Harris 1993; Grubert, et al. 1993; Harris, et
al. 1993; Jacob 1996; Collins and Shackelford 1997, Collins, Kemsley, and Lang 1997) produce
indirect evidence consistent with income shifting. They infer multijurisdictional behavior from a
single government’s data (either publicly available SEC filings or confidential U.S. corporate
income tax returns) and report associations between income and tax rates. Although several
studies produce evidence consistent with income shifting, few specify how firms avoid taxes,
leaving open the possibility that their results hinge on the omission of non-tax considerations that
are correlated with taxes.

At least two prior studies identify and test for specific multijurisdictional tax plans.
Collins, Kemsley, and Shackelford (1997) use data from U.S. tax returns to examine shipments
of inventory from foreign parents to U.S. subsidiaries in the wholesale trade industry. Contrary
to expectations, they find no evidence of transfer pricing abuses. Klassen and Shackelford
(1997) show firms avoid taxes by shipping manufactured goods from states with favorable
taxation. However, their inferences are limited because they rely on non-tax return data,
aggregated at the state level.
This paper analyzes firm-level data, collected from the publicly-available annual
regulatory reports used to compute tax bases and filed with multiple governments. The high
quality of the data enables the analysis to move beyond simply documenting income shifting to
identifying the allocations tax planners could manage to shift income and assessing whether
these accounts are managed. Its findings should interest accountants, tax planners, and insurers.
Specifically, we hypothesize that, in their statutory reports, insurers allocate premiums
and losses from multistate policies to reduce total state taxes. To test this prediction, reported
premiums at the insurer-state level, scaled by incurred losses, are regressed on state tax
measures. If allocations are managed to avoid taxes, we anticipate an inverse relation between
the tax rate and the premium-to-loss ratio, which is the industry’s standard measure of the price
of a unit of coverage. Firm-specific prices are computed using premium and loss information
from the annual regulatory reports filed with each state in which an insurer underwrites. Primary
analysis is conducted on 12,573 insurer-state observations from 1993.
Consistent with income shifting to avoid state taxes, we find the price of propertycasualty insurance is decreasing in state tax rates. The results are consistent with multistate
insurers managing their annual accounting reports to shift premiums (losses) to more (less)

2

favorably taxed states. Additional tests using insurers operating only in a single state corroborate
this interpretation. No negative relation is detected for single-state insurers. Inferences are
cautiously drawn; however, because we only examine 180 single-state insurers and they may
differ from multistate insurers along other dimensions.
The paper is organized as follows: The next section provides institutional background
about state taxation of insurance companies and develops a testable hypothesis. Section 3
outlines the research design. Section 4 details the paper’s findings. Concluding remarks follow.

II.

Background and Hypothesis Development
Each insurer files an annual statement in each state it operates. These regulatory reports

follow statutory accounting principles as developed by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (NAIC) and include a balance sheet, a statement of income and many
supplemental schedules and exhibits. Schedule T (Exhibit of Premiums Written--Allocated by
States and Territories) includes direct premiums earned and direct losses incurred by state.
Besides providing information for regulators and analysts, the statutory reports also are used to
compute tax bases for state taxes.1 The empirical tests in this paper are designed to determine
whether insurers manage the cross-state allocations of premiums and losses in Schedule T to
reduce overall tax costs.
Four states (Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, and New York) tax the profits of all
property-casualty insurance companies underwriting within their borders. Connecticut, Kansas,
and Oregon only tax the income of insurers incorporated in their states. The remaining states
(and Connecticut, Kansas, and Oregon if the insurer is incorporated outside their borders) tax

1

State taxes are not trivial. Petroni and Shackelford (1995) report that in 1990 the industry paid more to the states
($7 billion) than to the U.S. Federal government ($5.7 billion).

insurers’ premiums.2 For both income and premium taxes, the applicable tax rate is the greater
of the tax rate in the state where the insurance is sold and the tax rate in the state where the
insurer is incorporated. This unique feature of insurance company taxation is known as
retaliatory taxes (Petroni and Shackelford 1995).
Both premium and income taxes encourage insurers to shift premiums to states where the
tax burden is lighter. The income tax also creates incentives for insurers to overstate total claims
and other deductions. Understatement of total premiums is not a primary tax avoidance option
because state revenue officials can measure premiums with considerable precision. Similarly,
shifting losses across states is a limited tax strategy because state auditors can usually identify
the state where a loss occurs.
Tax avoidance through shifting premiums is facilitated by the industry’s reliance on
inherently imprecise accounting allocations in the preparation of the statutory reports’ Schedule
T. For single-state policies, the reporting process is straightforward. If the policy is sold in the
same state where the property is located and the insurer is incorporated, that state has sole
authority to tax the policy’s premiums or earnings. For multistate policies, insurers must allocate
premiums across the states involved in the transaction. For example, if a group of affiliated
hospitals in different states purchases a medical malpractice policy, the insurers must allocate the
policy’s income across the states where the hospitals are located, the policy is sold, and the
insurer is incorporated. Insurers specializing in lines with more multistate policies likely have
greater opportunities to avoid insurer taxes than other insurers because their reports rely more
heavily on the Schedule T allocation.

2

Some states tax both income and premiums and then permit one tax to be credited against the other tax. Private
discussions with state revenue officials reveal that insurers in these states effectively face only the income or the
premium tax. Consequently, no states in this study are treated as though both premium and income taxes apply.

4

States provide little guidance concerning the allocation process. The process is
sufficiently murky that Harrington (1984, 614) contends any state allocations “depend on
arbitrary assumptions that might make the resulting figures meaningless.” Private discussions
with state revenue officials suggest tax audits primarily focus on determining whether all income
is reported in some state. The allocations across states, which enable income shifting and are the
focus of this study, reportedly receive less attention. Limited allocation regulations and
enforcement lead to the paper’s hypothesis, stated in its alternative form:
H1: The premium-to-loss ratios that multistate insurers report to state tax authorities are
decreasing in the marginal tax rate applied to their underwriting in the state.
Despite several factors suggesting Schedule T allocations are conducive to tax
management, a countervailing implicit tax effect, inducing a positive relation between prices and
taxes, biases against finding tax avoidance in this setting. Assuming competitive conditions and
no tax-motivated management of the Schedule T allocations, the price of insurance should be bid
up (down) in states that tax property-casualty insurers less (more) favorably until the after-tax
returns to investing in underwriting are identical across all states. To achieve such equality,
before-tax returns increase in state tax levies (Scholes and Wolfson 1992; Shackelford 1991;
Guenther 1994). To the extent premiums and losses reflect adjustments in before-tax returns, our
estimates of tax-motivated income shifting will be understated.

III.

Research Design

Dependent Variable
To determine whether multistate insurers avoid state taxes through strategic allocations in
the statutory reports, insurance prices are regressed on measures of state taxes, controlling for
previously documented price determinants:

5

PRICEij = $0 + $1 tax measuresij + $2 control variablesj + $3 control variablesi + ,ij
for all insurers i and states j.
The dependent variable, PRICE, is the insurer's premiums less policyholder dividends
divided by losses incurred (including estimated unpaid claims at year-end) as reported in
Schedule T of the annual regulatory reports. This premium-to-loss ratio is recognized within the
insurance industry as the ex post price of a dollar of coverage. A superior dependent variable
would be the ex ante price of insurance; however, we are unaware of readily available data that
would permit us to compute ex ante prices. Using an ex post measure is only problematic if
unanticipated catastrophes occur disproportionately in states with similar tax structure. To
mitigate this concern, the study is limited to 1993, a year without major earthquake or hurricane
damage.3
For the insurer-states that do not face income taxation, an ideal dependent variable would
include only premiums because losses do not affect tax liabilities in those states. However, if the
sample is restricted to those insurer-states and premiums are used as the dependent variable, a
scalar is needed to control for heteroskedasticity, and the most appropriate scalar is losses. Thus,
the premium-to-loss ratio probably is the best dependent variable for assessing premium tax
avoidance. Moreover, for the insurer-states facing income taxes, losses are the largest deduction.
The ratio also controls for the possibility that some premiums are inseparable from their
associated losses for shifting purposes and thus of limited use in avoiding income taxes. On the
other hand, to the extent insurers mask premium tax avoidance by shifting both losses and
premiums, PRICE may reduce the power of the tests to detect premium tax management.

In 1993 eight states suffered losses in excess of $500 million from floods of the Mississippi and adjoining rivers.
Inferences are unaltered when the insurer-states in these eight states are excluded from the analysis.

6

Tax Variables
The ideal tax measure is the marginal tax rate each property-casualty insurer faces in each
state. Unfortunately, the data do not permit such fine calibrations. Instead, we employ two
alternative measures to approximate marginal tax rates: the effective (or average) state tax rate
on insurers and the estimated statutory (premium and income) tax rates. To determine the
relevant tax rate for each insurer-state, insurers’ unique retaliatory tax structure must be
incorporated in the tax measures. Thus, the insurer-state tax rate is the greater of the tax rate in
the state where the insurance is sold and the tax rate in the state where the insurer is
incorporated.4 Negative coefficients on the tax measures are consistent with tax management of
the annual statements.
The first tax measure is the effective tax rate in each state, i.e., the total taxes (premium
and income) collected from all insurers within the state as a percentage of total premiums. ETR
for an insurer-state is the greater of the effective tax rate in the state where the policy is written
and the effective tax rate in the state where the insurer is incorporated. Petroni and Shackelford
(1995) employ this tax measure because it enables them to convert various state systems for
taxing insurers to one comparable measure. Unfortunately, ETR masks cross-insurer rate
differences and includes taxes and premiums from life and health insurance companies. Petroni
and Shackelford (1995), however, assert that the inclusion of life and health insurers should not
materially affect inferences because states tax the two sectors similarly. ETR also fails to
distinguish between insurer taxes arising from premium taxes and insurer taxes arising from
income taxes.
To provide some segregation of these effects, a variable indicating the presence of an
income tax in the state (INCDUM) is included in the regressions using ETR as an explanatory

7

variable. No prediction is advanced for INCDUM because it is unclear whether prices are lower
in income tax states or premium tax states.5
ETR also is modified to assess the sensitivity of tax avoidance to insurance lines.
EASYETR is ETR for the insurers writing greater than 75 percent of their business in lines other
than automobile, farm, fire, home, and workers’ compensation and zero for other insurers.
Specifically, these insurers concentrate their business in liability, medical malpractice,
reinsurance, and credit and surety lines. EASYETR’s coefficient is expected to be negative,
consistent with increased tax management in lines with more opportunities for Schedule T crossstate allocations. The first four lines involve insured property confined largely to a single state.
Workers’ compensation is the most tightly regulated line of insurance. In fact, some states
require its purchase from state workers’ compensation funds. Consequently, insurers have
limited opportunity to allocate workers’ compensation insurance across states.
The second set of tax measures provides more precise segregation of premium tax and
income tax effects. They are the statutory premium tax rates (PREMRATE) and income tax
rates (INCRATE) applicable to each property-casualty insurer-state. To the extent tax bases and
tax credits vary across states, statutory tax rates measure marginal tax rates with error. A casual
review of state tax systems suggests that states vary considerably along both dimensions. In
particular, 16 states provide rate reductions if insurers invest substantially in state securities,
employ state residents, establish regional offices in the state, etc. If the insurer is incorporated in

4

Five percent of the sample involves observations from the insurer’s state of incorporation.
Income taxes, unlike premium taxes, are reduced by loss overstatement as well as premium understatement.
Consequently, insurers may avoid income taxes more easily than premium taxes. If so, the coefficient on INCDUM
should be negative.

the state, we assume the insurer qualified for the most favorable tax rate available. In all other
cases, we assume the insurer did not qualify for any rate reduction.6

State-specific Control Variables
A large literature has investigated the determinants of insurance prices. Several control
variables are included in the paper’s regressions to ensure that these non-tax determinants do not
affect our inferences about the effects of state taxes on insurance prices. The first set of control
variables addresses cross-state variation in the price of insurance.
Two variables are used to control for the effects of product sales regulation on prices.7
The first regulatory control variable is RATEREG, a categorical variable indicating whether the
state is one of the 26 that regulate insurance rates. The second regulatory control variable is
RESTRICT, which ranks each state from one to 51, based on Conning & Company’s survey of
insurance managers in 1991. The survey assesses the relative freedom among states to manage
personal and commercial lines of business. The higher the ranking, the more restrictions the
state places on insurers’ ability to design, price, and market their products.
Negative coefficients are expected on RATEREG and RESTRICT. In his survey of the
numerous empirical studies evaluating the effects of state regulation on insurance prices,
Harrington (1984) concludes that the evidence generally is consistent with insurance rates
decreasing in the stringency of state regulatory oversight. Similarly, Vines (1996) reports that
customers in rate-regulated states bore less of the industry’s Federal income tax increase
following the Tax Reform Act of 1986 than customers in other states.

6

Inferences are unchanged if the average of the maximum statutory tax rate and the most favorable statutory tax rate
is used.
7 Product sales regulations include prior approval of rates and guidelines concerning trade practices, insurance
policies and contracts, advertising, marketing, cancellation of policies, and other operating practices.

9

Negative relations between PRICE and the product sales regulation variables also are
expected because insurers have incentives to manage the statutory reports to appear less
profitable in rate regulated states. Regulators use the same financial information that determines
tax bases to evaluate an insurer’s profitability. In high-tax, rate regulated states, the tax and
regulatory incentives are aligned, increasing the returns to premium understatement and (in
income tax states) loss overstatement. In low-tax, rate regulated states, tax and regulatory
incentives conflict.8
NOFAULT is a categorical variable indicating whether the state is one of the 14 with nofault automobile coverage. Because Witt and Urrutia (1983) find the price of automobile
insurance is less in states with no-fault insurance, a negative coefficient is expected for
NOFAULT.
INSPOP is number of insurers per 1000 people in the state. Browne and Hoyt (1995)
find that a 10 percent reduction in the number of property-casualty insurers results in an 82
percent reduction in the industry’s insolvency rate. They interpret this finding as evidence that
fewer insurers result in less competition and higher prices. To the extent INSPOP captures
competition, its coefficient is expected to be negative.

Insurer-specific Control Variables
The remainder of the control variables addresses cross-insurer variation in the price of
insurance. DIRWRITE is a categorical variable indicating whether the insurer directly sells its
policies, as opposed to using independent agents. Several studies (e.g., Joskow 1973; Cummins

8 See Scholes, et al. (1990), Collins, et al. (1995), Beatty, et al. (1995), and Collins, Geisler, and Shackelford (1997)
for examples of studies addressing the coordination of multiple incentives, including taxes, regulatory capital and
earnings.

10

and VanDerhei 1979; Cummins, et al. 1980; and Witt and Miller 1981) report the price of
insurance decreases in the presence of direct writers. Accordingly, a negative coefficient on
DIRWRITE is expected.
SIZE is the natural logarithm of the insurer’s admitted assets.9 Larger insurers can
charge lower prices because they can amortize their fixed costs over a larger pool and diversify
their risks more easily. Thus, PRICE is expected to be decreasing in SIZE.
Sommer (1996) reports a positive relation between the price of insurance and the
insurer’s capitalization and a negative relation between price and the insurer’s investment
portfolio volatility. He infers from these relations that prices are decreasing in an insurer’s
solvency risk. To control for such effects, the regression includes two measures of solvency risk.
CAPITAL is an insurer’s statutory surplus divided by its total admitted assets. PORTRISK is the
percentage of an insurer’s assets in more volatile investments, namely equity, unoccupied real
estate and mortgage loans.10 PRICE is predicted to be increasing in CAPITAL and decreasing in
PORTRISK.
The final controls are a vector of measures denoting the insurer’s percentage of propertycasualty underwriting in accident and health, automotive, credit and surety, liability, medical
malpractice, reinsurance, and worker’s compensation. All remaining lines are combined. The
lines of business are included in the regression to control for possible price variations across
lines. No predictions are advanced for the coefficients on the lines of business.

9

Total admitted assets are total assets less furniture, equipment, automobiles, accounts receivable not taken from
premiums, and investments not meeting return requirements or made in excess of permissible limits.
10 Results are qualitatively unaltered when the numerator of PORTRISK excludes equity.

11

Data and Sample
Each insurer’s financial data, state of incorporation, and the number of insurers operating
in each state are collected for 1993 from the NAIC Property/Casualty Annual Statement
Database.11 Each state’s total taxes collected from insurance companies are gathered from the
NAIC Insurance Department’s Resources Report for 1993. Information regarding state taxation
of insurance companies is gathered from the NAIC publication, Retaliation: A Guide to
Retaliatory Taxes, Fees, Deposits, and Other Requirements. Information regarding the state
regulation of insurance prices is collected from a 1989 NAIC rate regulation survey. The states
with no-fault insurance are identified in Insurance Information Institute’s 1993 Fact Book.
Direct writers are identified based on a list of no-fault insurers in 1993 supplied by the A.M. Best
Co. The population of each state in 1993 is collected from the 1994 U.S. Statistical Abstract.
The sample is limited to property and casualty insurance companies that operate in more
than one state (multistate insurers). The sample is further restricted to stock insurers, the
industry’s principal ownership structure, to control for possible variation across organizational
forms (e.g., see Mayers and Smith 1988, 1994). The data produce 19,239 insurer-states in 1993.
Observations with extreme values of PRICE (less than one-half or greater than three) are deleted
from the sample, leaving 12,573 insurer-states.12 They include 920 insurers with the median
insurer underwriting in nine states.

11 Data source: NAIC, by permission. The NAIC does not endorse any analysis or conclusions based on the use of
these data.
12 Inferences are insensitive to restricting the sample to either positive values of PRICE less than five or positive
values of PRICE less than ten.

Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the regression variables. Mean and median
PRICE is 1.61, reflecting a 61 percent markup from losses on insurance products. ETR ranges
from 0.6 percent to 2.8 percent with a mean and median value of 1.5 percent, indicating that, on
average, insurers remit 1.5 percent of a policy’s premiums in state taxes. Ten percent of the
insurer-state observations are from the seven states that levy income taxes on property-casualty
insurers. Mean (median) PREMRATE is 2.4 (2.3) percent. Mean INCRATE is 0.6 percent,
implying that the 1,222 observations from states with insurer income taxes face an average
income tax rate of 6.4 percent.
INSERT TABLE 1

The descriptive statistics for the control variables show 39 percent of the sample is in rate
regulated states, indicating the sample is disproportionately in the 25 states that do not regulate
insurance rates. Twenty-seven percent of the sample is in the 14 states with no-fault automobile
insurance. INSPOP ranges from 0.03 to 1.24, indicating wide variation in the number of insurers
per state, after controlling for population. Twenty percent of the insurers are direct writers.
Insurance company assets range from $1 million to $28 billion. The mean (median) insurer
reports assets of $1 billion ($200 million). Statutory surplus averages one-third of total admitted
assets. On average, equity, unoccupied real estate, and mortgage loans account for 14% of total
invested assets.

13

Univariate Analysis
Consistent with the annual statements being managed to reduce state taxes, Table 2’s
Pearson correlation coefficients for PRICE and ETR and for PRICE and INCRATE variables are
negative (-0.03) and significant at the 0.05 level. The correlation between PRICE and
PREMRATE is not significantly different from zero.

INSERT TABLE 2

The signs of the Pearson correlation coefficients between PRICE and every control
variable, except PORTRISK, are consistent with prior findings. Contrary to expectations, the
correlation between PRICE and PORTRISK is positive, though not significantly different from
zero. The statistically significant correlations between the tax and control variables suggest that:
(1) Rate regulated states are less likely to impose income taxes on insurers. (2) No-fault states
have lower premium taxes and higher income taxes. (3) Premium (income) taxes are increasing
(decreasing) in the number of insurers per capita.

Results

ETR
The regression results in Table 3 present evidence that is consistent with propertycasualty insurers managing their accounting reports to mitigate tax costs.13 In the tests
conducted using multistate insurers (columns A-E), the regression coefficient estimates on ETR,

13 Table 3 reports t-statistics using White’s adjusted standard errors when the null hypothesis of correct model
specification under White’s (1980) test is rejected at conventional levels. Inferences are unaltered, however, if no
corrections are made.

14

PREMRATE and INCRATE are always negative, as predicted, and significant with t-statistics
ranging from –1.90 to –4.41.

INSERT TABLE 3

Column A reports the summary statistics for ETR, INCDUM, and eight previously
documented price determinants. Coefficient estimates are not reported for the eight lines of
business. The regression coefficient on ETR is -5.33 with a t-statistic of -4.41, consistent with
reported prices falling in state insurer taxes. The coefficient implies that a one standard
deviation increase in the effective state tax rate (0.005) decreases the reported premium-to-loss
ratio by 0.027 (-5.33 * 0.005). Evaluated at the mean PRICE of 1.61, the finding indicates that
insurers respond to a standard deviation increase in ETR by understating the insurance prices
they report to state regulators and tax officials by 1.7 percent (0.027 / 1.61).
These estimates assume the formation of implicit taxes exerts no upward pressure on
prices when taxes are increased. To estimate implicit tax effects, let A be the after-tax return all
insurer-states face, let P be the pre-tax return for insurer-state i, and J be the tax rate in insurerstate i. In all insurer-states, A = Pi (1-Ji) and *P / *J = P / (1-J). Evaluating P at the mean value
for PRICE (1.61) and J at the mean value for ETR (0.015), the derivative is 1.63. Thus, a one
standard deviation increase in ETR (0.005) would be expected to increase PRICE by 0.008
(1.63*0.005).
Subtracting the 0.008 implicit tax-induced price increase from the earlier estimate of the
reduction in the premium-loss ratio following a one standard deviation drop in ETR (-0.027),
yields a total price reduction of -0.035. Dividing this sum by mean PRICE suggests insurers

15

would understate the insurance prices they report to state regulators and tax officials by 2.2
percent (-0.035 / 1.61) if ETR were decreased by a standard deviation. In summary, including an
estimate of implicit taxes increases the estimated tax-avoidance price response by 29% [(2.21.7)/1.7].
The estimated regression coefficient for INCDUM implies that insurer-states facing an
income tax report 5.4 percent (-0.087 / 1.61) lower insurance prices than insurer-states facing a
premium tax. INCDUM’s negative coefficient is consistent with insurer-states that face income
taxes engaging in more price understatement than other insurers.

EASYETR
Column B shows the coefficients when EASYETR is included as a regressor. Recall
EASYETR is intended to identify insurers that underwrite primarily in lines with the most
opportunity for avoiding taxes through cross-state allocation of multistate policies. Sixteen
percent of the sample involves insurer-states with a positive value for EASYETR, i.e., write
greater than 75 percent of their business in lines other than automobile, farm, fire, home and
workers’ compensation.
The regression coefficient in Column B on EASYETR is –5.35 (t-statistic = -3.74),
consistent with lower reported prices by insurers specializing in lines where opportunities are
greater to avoid taxes. Combining the ETR and EASYETR coefficients, the estimated lowerbound response (no implicit taxes) for these insurers to a one standard deviation increase in the
effective state tax rate is a 0.049 decrease in the reported premium-to-loss ratio or a 3.0 percent
drop in reported insurance prices. The corresponding estimated upper-bound response (assuming

16

full implicit tax effects) is a 0.057 (0.049 + 0.008) decrease in the reported premium-to-loss ratio
or a 3.5 percent drop in reported insurance prices.

PREMRATE and INCRATE
Column C shows that the coefficients on PREMRATE (-1.83 with t-statistic of –1.90)
and INCRATE (-0.94 with a t-statistic of –3.57) are consistent with state premium tax and
income tax avoidance, respectively. The results using statutory tax rates confirm the earlier
findings using effective tax rates. A standard deviation increase in the PREMRATE (0.006
percentage points) reduces reported insurance prices by 0.7 (2.1) percent assuming no (full)
implicit taxes.14 INCRATE’s coefficient implies that a one percentage point increase in a state’s
income tax rate would decrease reported insurance prices by 0.6 (1.0) percent assuming no (full)
implicit taxes.15

Control Variables
With one exception, the signs of the other regression coefficient estimates are as
predicted. The coefficients on RATEREG and RESTRICT are negative, consistent with both
prices being suppressed and profits being underreported in states with more restrictive product
sales regulation. The coefficient on NOFAULT is negative, consistent with prior studies
indicating lower prices in states with no-fault automotive insurance. INSPOP’s coefficient is

14 The price effect including implicit taxes is -0.021=0.006*{-1.83-[1.61/(1-0.024)]}. Mean PREMRATE is 0.024.
15 To include implicit taxes in determining the economic significance of the income tax avoidance, a modification
of *P / *J is required. Let the pre-tax return (P) equal the mark-up to losses (premiums less losses). (Data
constraints limit the analysis to the primary sources of income and deductions, ignoring other income and deductions
used to determine taxable income.) Mark-up is the mean value for premiums (1.61) less the mean value for losses
(1.00). Evaluating the derivative with pre-tax returns of 0.61 and the mean tax rate facing insurers in income tax
states (0.064) to estimate the tax rate, implicit taxes cause a one percentage point increase in J to increase P by 0.007
[0.61/(1-.064)]*0.01.

17

negative, consistent with prices falling in the presence of increased competition. The coefficient
on DIRWRITE also is negative, confirming prior findings that insurers who directly sell their
policies offer lower prices. The coefficient on SIZE also is negative, suggesting larger insurers
offer lower prices. CAPITAL’s coefficient is positive, consistent with less capitalized firms
having to accept lower prices in response to buyers’ concerns about their insolvency.
The sole control variable with the wrong sign is PORTRISK. Consistent with Sommer
(1996), we anticipated insurers with riskier investments would be forced to lower the price of
their insurance in response to buyers’ concerns about their insolvency. However, consistent with
the positive correlation coefficient between PRICE and PORTRISK, the regression coefficient
on PORTRISK is positive. Differences in Sommer (1996) and our measures of portfolio risk
may explain the different results.16 However, this control does not appear to affect the paper’s
inferences. Quantitative results are almost identical when the regression is reestimated,
excluding PORTRISK from the explanatory variables.
The regression coefficient estimates for the lines of business are not presented in Table 3,
and we offered no predictions concerning their signs. However, the coefficients on the accident
and health, reinsurance, and worker’s compensation lines are negative and significant at
conventional levels, suggesting that markups are smaller in these lines. The coefficients on the
credit and surety, liability and miscellaneous lines are positive and significant, implying markups
are larger in these lines.17

16 Sommer (1996) measures portfolio risk by estimating the investment portfolio standard deviation. He uses
estimates of the insurer’s asset and liability volatilities and the correlation coefficient between the asset and liability
processes to quantify a risk parameter from option pricing. Sommer (1996) asserts that his measure is an
improvement over the typical approaches used to determine portfolio risk, such as our method. Unfortunately, his
measure would require acquisition of prohibitively expensive data from multiple years for our sample. Sommer
limits his sample to 142 insurer groups and uses quarterly time series data from 1975 to 1989. With our large
sample, we adopt the simpler industry standard in computing PORTRISK.
17 To control for the possibility that purchases of lines vary across states, sensitivity tests include state lines of
business. The vector of state line variables measure the percentage of each line of business aggregated at the state

18

Robustness Tests
Columns D and E report the results from two tests of the robustness of the results to
different specifications. Conclusions are qualitatively unaltered by the results in these two
regressions. Column D uses a separate intercept for each insurer instead of insurer-specific
controls (DIRWRITE, SIZE, CAPITAL, PORTRISK, and lines of business). The tax measures
remain negative and highly significant. The coefficient on ETR is –4.07 with a t-statistic of
–3.07. The coefficient on INCDUM is –0.063 with a t-statistic of –3.73.
Column E presents summary statistics from an alternative estimation procedure
undertaken to assess whether the t-statistics in the earlier regressions are overstated. Because our
sample includes multiple observations for every insurer, the OLS residuals likely are
contemporaneously correlated, potentially biasing the standard errors (Bernard 1987). To assess
the extent of the bias, we estimate standard errors by applying the Froot (1989) technique. The
Froot (1989) standard errors account for intra-insurer correlations in the residuals of each insurer
and heteroskedasticity. They are consistent and asymptotically efficient.
To limit computational demands, we apply the Froot technique to the regression reported
in Column A, excluding CAPITAL, PORTRISK, and the eight lines of business variables.18 The
OLS coefficient estimates from this modified model are essentially identical to those reported in
Column A. The Froot adjusted standard errors are generally higher than the OLS standard
errors, but the significance of the t-statistics is qualitatively unchanged. In short, any

level as a percentage of the state’s total insurance business. When the state lines of business are included as
regressors with the other explanatory variables in Column A, only the coefficient on the miscellaneous line is
significant at the 0.05 level.
18 We were unable to secure computational capacity that would permit estimation of the entire model reported in
Column A using the Froot (1989) technique. Criteria for discarding control variables were (1) variables without a
predicted sign (eight lines of business), (2) variables whose coefficients have the wrong sign in Column A
(PORTRISK) and (3) among variables whose coefficients have the predicted sign, the one with the smallest tstatistic (CAPITAL) in Column A.

19

interdependencies caused by multiple observations for insurers neither overstate the statistical
significance of our results nor affect the inferences drawn from OLS regressions.

Single-state insurers
If the tax management hypothesized in this paper exists, i.e., tax-motivated cross-state
allocations of premiums and losses in the statutory reports filed with state officials, then the
coefficients on the tax variables should not be negative if the tests are conducted using a set of
insurers that file with only one state. Forced to report all premiums and losses from all
underwriting in a single state, these insurers could not avail themselves of a tax management
strategy that requires multistate filings. Column F reports the results from estimating the
regression equation using 180 insurers who only underwrite in their state of incorporation and
are unaffiliated with any insurers in other states.
When the sample is restricted to single-state insurers (Column F), the tax coefficients are
positive, though not significantly different from zero. The failure to find significantly negative
tax coefficients using single-state insurers provides further evidence that multistate insurers are
reducing taxes through manipulation of Schedule T. The absence of a negative sign on ETR in
Column F’s results implies multistate insurers enjoy a competitive advantage, compared with
single-state insurers, because they can access a tax reduction strategy unavailable to single-state
insurers.
However, the results from the single-state regression must be interpreted cautiously.
Unlike the multistate estimates, none of the coefficients on the explanatory variables, except
RATEREG, is significantly different from zero. The poor specification is consistent with both
inadequate power from the smaller single-state insurer sample and unspecified differences in the

20

price determinants of multistate and single-state insurers. In particular, the known price
determinants, which serve as explanatory variables in this study, largely come from analyses of
multistate insurers. Thus, the single-state tests only provide qualified support of income shifting
through multistate allocations.

Other specification checks
The findings in this study are robust to a battery of additional specification checks. One,
some states permit insurers to credit guaranty fund assessments against premium taxes. In those
states, the statutory tax rate likely overstates the premium tax burden, and insurers have an
incentive to overstate premiums. To assess the effect of guaranty fund assessments on the
findings, the regression model was reestimated excluding insurers from six states (Arizona,
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Texas) that account for 82 percent of all assessments in
the U.S.19 Inferences are qualitatively unaltered.
Two, to control for possible cross-state variation in the demand for insurance, we added
the gross state product per capita (as reported in the 1997 U.S. Statistical Abstract) as a
regressor. Its coefficient is not significantly different from zero, and its inclusion did not
overturn any prior inferences.
Three, the correlation matrix in Table 2 shows no relation between the tax variables and
RESTRICT, a measure of a state’s regulatory climate. However, it is conceivable that state tax
avoidance might be curtailed in more regulated states. To assess whether tax management varies
with an insurer’s operational freedom, we interacted ETR with a categorical variable determined
by whether the state’s RESTRICT value exceeded the mean RESTRICT value. When the

19

1993 guaranty fund assessments were collected from the Insurance Information Institute’s 1995 Fact Book.

21

interaction term is included in the regression, it is not significantly different from zero and other
coefficients are qualitatively unaffected.
Four, to determine whether the results vary between large and small insurers, we
segregate the sample into the 8,860 insurer-states with greater than $500,000 in premiums and
the remaining 3,713 smaller insurers. Conclusions about the effect of state taxes on insurance
prices do not vary between subsamples.

V.

Conclusion
This paper attributes an association between insurers’ premium-to-loss ratios and state

taxes to the allocation of premiums and losses by multistate insurers. Insurers likely find this
form of income shifting efficient because it is largely unimpeded by stringent state guidelines or
enforcement. To our knowledge, this study is the first to document income shifting using firmlevel data, collected from the publicly-available accounting reports used to compute tax bases
and filed with multiple governments. Although documentation of income shifting is not unique,
the quality of the data and the ability to specify how income shifting is accomplished distinguish
this paper from prior income shifting studies.
The paper also contributes to our understanding of the insurance industry by showing that
state tax planning extends beyond the initial expansion decision (Petroni and Shackelford 1995)
to include management of the annual regulatory reports. The findings raise questions about the
reliability of the industry’s statutory reports. This demonstration of tax manipulation should be
of particular interest to regulators, who rely on the annual statements to establish rates and assess
solvency, rating agencies that rely on the accounting reports to assess solvency, and analysts,
who rely on the accounting reports to differentiate among products.

22

Finally, by including implicit taxes in its estimates of income shifting, this paper is the
first, to our knowledge, to consider jointly the negative price-tax relation induced by taxmotivated income shifting and the positive price-tax relation induced by the formation of implicit
taxes. Prior income shifting studies have ignored implicit taxes, potentially understating tax
manipulation.
More explicit recognition of the countervailing forces of income shifting and implicit
taxes is needed to advance our understanding of both effects. Although employing similar tests,
the two lines advance opposite predictions of the price-tax relation. The critical distinction
appears to be an ex ante assessment of the quality of the price data. Income shifting studies
examine self-reported data (from financial statements or statutory reports) that are subject to
manipulation. Tax shifting studies use independent price measures that are not easily managed,
e.g., Shackelford (1991) uses bank loans and Guenther (1994) uses Treasury bills. Future
research should consider more formal theoretical underpinning for the predicted price-tax
relation.
