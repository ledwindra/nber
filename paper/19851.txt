ABSTRACT
Internet-based educational resources are proliferating rapidly. One concern associated with these
(potentially transformative) technological changes is that they will be disequalizing – as many
technologies of the last several decades have been – creating superstar teachers and a winner-takeall education system. These important concerns notwithstanding, we contend that a major impact of
web-based educational technologies will be the democratization of education: educational resources
will be more equally distributed, and lower-skilled teachers will benefit. At the root of our results
is the observation that skilled lecturers can only exploit their comparative advantage if other teachers
complement those lectures with face-to-face instruction. This complementarity will increase the
quantity and quality of face-to-face teaching services, potentially increasing the marginal product
and wages of lower-skill teachers.

Introduction

Educational resources distributed via the Internet are proliferating rapidly. These new resources
include lecture videos, on-line teaching notes, Internet chat groups, on-line interactive problem sets
with instantaneous feedback/grading, educational games, and many other developing technologies.
Numerous institutions have created fully autonomous software that grades student essays.1 In the
popular press, MOOCs (massive open on-line courses) have received the most fanfare, though the
social value of these courses is as of yet unproven and the high drop-out rates (in excess of 90%)
have been fodder for much debate.2
One technology that promises to be particularly scalable is lecture videos and other online
teaching tools. These make the skills of the most e¤ective teachers widely available to students
around the world, making lecturing almost non-rivalrous. One prominent concern, however, is
that these sweeping technological changes will be disequalizing  as many of the leading technologies
of the last several decades have been  creating winner-take-all "superstar" teachers and a wider
gulf between di¤erent groups of students.3 These important concerns notwithstanding, we contend
that a major impact of web-based educational technologies will be the democratization of education:
educational resources will be more equally distributed, and lower-skill teachers will bene t.
At the root of our results are two observations. First, in the status quo there is considerable
inequality in the distribution of educational resources both within countries and especially between
countries. Second, for web-based technologies to exploit the comparative advantage of skilled lecturers, these technologies will need to be complemented with opportunities for face-to-face discussions
with instructors.
In the model we use to formalize these ideas, new human capital is generated using the existing
human capital of students (arising from prior education or as a family endowment) and various
complementary teaching activities (e.g., lecturing, grading, class discussions, one-on-one conversations, etc.). Web-based technologies enable teachers to generate non-rival educational services that

can be used as inputs in multiple countries/classrooms simultaneously (e.g., an Internet lecture that
can be watched simultaneously in Beijing and Baltimore), but these still need to be complemented
with one-on-one instruction provided by local teachers.
The ability to create non-rival educational services via the web generates four interrelated
consequences.
The rst is a two-part technological windfall for students: (i) students now have access to
lectures of the best (superstar) global teachers rather than relying entirely on lectures from local
teachers; and (ii) the teacher resources freed from lecturing are reallocated to other, complementary
teaching activities. Both of these e¤ects raise the educational attainment of all students in all
countries (except the leader country).
The second consequence is a democratizing e¤ect which reduces inequality of human capital
between students, since gains in educational attainment are disproportionately concentrated at the
bottom of the educational attainment gradient.
The third consequence is an expected negative crowd-out e¤ect on non-superstar teachers,
who are dislocated from their lecturing tasks. They instead focus on teaching activities that are not
web-based, and due to diminishing returns in these tasks, their marginal product and thus wages
are depressed.
The fourth consequence, however, is a complementarity e¤ect. This o¤sets the third e¤ect, and
may lead to a net positive e¤ect on the salaries of non-superstar teachers. Web-based technologies
raise the quantity and quality of web-based educational inputs that are complementary for local
teachers, thereby raising these local teachers marginal product and earnings.
A priori either the third or fourth e¤ect could dominate. We show that the positive complementarity e¤ect dominates for teachers with su¢ciently low levels of human capital, while the crowd-out
e¤ect dominates for teachers with su¢ciently high (but non-superstar) levels of human capital. In
particular, teachers with skill levels below a critical threshold see their earnings increase.

Model

To aid exposition, we refer to two human capital production regimes: the pre- and post-Internet
regimes.

2

2.1

Pre-Internet allocation

The world consists of N islands (e.g., countries), each inhabited by a continuum s > 0 of students
and a continuum 1 of teachers. Without loss of generality we normalize s = 1.
We study the impact of technology in enabling cross-island application of teachers knowledge
and skills. We assume that the human capital of all students before they enter formal schooling is
the same within an island, and in each country j we denote this endowment by ej . We also assume
that the human capital of all teachers within an island is the same, given by hj on island j. All
teachers in the world have one unit of time.
The post-schooling human capital of students on island j, which we refer to as educational
attainment, is also equal to their labor earnings, and is given by
yj = e1j
where

Xj ;

(1)

2 (0; 1) and Xj is an aggregator of the teaching services supplied on island j. Speci cally,

we assume a Cobb-Douglas (unit elasticity) aggregator of the form
Z 1
ln Xj =
ln xj (i)di;
0

where xj (i) is the amount of teaching task i available to students on island j.
The resource constraint for the skills and time of teachers on island j implies
Z 1
xj (i)di = hj :
0

The total supply of skills on island j is hj (the skill level of teachers multiplied by their unit time
endowment) and this can be allocated in any way across the di¤erent teaching tasks.
We assume that all services and teaching tasks are competitively priced, and teachers choose the
allocation of their time and skills to these tasks given market prices. Since there are no externalities,
this allocation can be alternatively computed as the solution to the maximization problem of an
island-level social planner maximizing average (or total) post-schooling human capital on the island.
In view of the concavity of the production function (1) in xj (i), this allocation will involve
xj (i) = hj ;
giving a post-schooling human capital of
yj = e1j
3

hj ;

or, in logs,
ln yj = (1

) ln ej +

ln hj :

(2)

In what follows, we assume that there is perfect rank correlation between ej and hj , meaning
that ej > ek implies hj > hk for all j; k. Intuitively, islands that have higher human capital
students also have higher human capital teachers.4 Then, from (2), the cross-island distribution
of post-schooling human capital is more unequal than in the hypothetical case in which all islands
have access to the same quality teachers.
We can also determine the incomes of teachers on di¤erent islands. These are given by the
marginal contribution of teachers to student labor earnings (in a competitive equilibrium) times
the supply of teaching skills. This can be written
wj =

@yj
hj = e1j
@hj

hj

hj = e1j

hj :

(3)

From now on, we rank the islands in descending order of teacher skills, so that island 1 has the
teachers with the highest value of hj .

2.2

Post-Internet: Student Attainment

To operationalize the introduction of web-based technologies, we imagine a technological change
that enables a teaching task to be performed by a single teacher and then broadcast to the rest
of the world. Only some teaching tasks have this special non-rivalrous property, speci cally those
indexed from [0; ] for some

< 1: We use the term lecturing for those tasks that can be scaled

to an arbitrary number of students at essentially zero marginal cost (e.g., creating video lectures or
writing problem sets). We refer to the remaining tasks in the set, with mass ( ; 1]; as hands-on
instruction (e.g., small group interactions), which need to be performed by teachers on the same
island as their students. For simplicity, we assume that each lecturing task uses exactly one unit
of teacher time.
Given this new technology, lecturing tasks are performed by teachers on island 1, and thus
students in each island j = 1; :::; N have access to
x0j (i) = h1 for all i 2 [0; ] and j = 1; :::; N;
4

In fact, all we require is that ln ej and ln hj are positively correlated across islands (e.g., normally distributed
across islands with positive covariance).

4

where throughout we use variables with a prime (e.g., x0 ) to denote post-Internet values. In view
of this, and the resource constraint on island 1, the post-schooling human capital of students on
island 1 does not change. In particular, the fraction

of teachers will now be working in lecturing

tasks that are being broadcast to the rest of the world while the remaining 1

fraction of teachers

work in hands-on instruction.
On other islands, however, the post-schooling levels of human capital will change for two reasons.
First, the students have access to the higher quality lectures from superstar teachers on island 1.
Second, the teachers in islands j = 2; :::; N can now focus on instruction, so instruction tasks are
more abundantly supplied.
It follows that the post-schooling human capital of students on island j = 2; :::; N is given by

Note that both terms on the right-hand-side of this equality are positive, and that they jointly
comprise the technology windfall mentioned in the Introduction. The rst term captures the
bene ts of substitution of h1 for hj in (web-based) lecturing activities. The second term captures
the e¤ect of greater hands-on instruction: because local teachers no longer need to lecture, they
reallocate their time to hands-on instruction. Hands-on instruction thus rises by a factor of 1=(1

).

Together, these two e¤ects establish our rst claim from the Introduction, that all students in nonleader islands bene t from web-based education.
Our second claim, concerning the democratizing e¤ect of web-based education, also follows
from equation (4). Consider two islands j and k (6= 1) with hj < hk (and thus by assumption
yj < yk ). We then have
ln

implying that the human capital gap between the two islands will narrow after web-based education
proliferates. Moreover, this expression also implies that the larger the initial percentage di¤erence
between hj and hk , ln(hk =hj ), the larger the percentage point fall in in the human capital gap.
This is true regardless of the values of ej and ek . Consequently, web-based education compresses
human capital inequality across islands.
In fact, the result is even more stark: the post-Internet regime has no e¤ect on the educational
attainment of students in the lead island and pulls up the post-schooling human capital of students
on all other islands.5 Moreover, the model implies the possibility of local overtaking: students on
islands with endowments, ej and hj , that are close to the lead island will overtake students on
the lead island, because the students on such close trailing islands receive the combined bene ts of
lead-island lectures and greater hands-on instruction from local teachers (i.e., hands-on instruction
is scaled up by factor 1=(1

)). After web-based education, the educational outcome of a trailing

island exceeds the educational outcome of the lead island (ln yj0 > ln y10 ) if and only if:

Post-Internet: Teacher Wages

(5)

This expression encapsulates both the third and fourth e¤ects of web-based education on teacher
earnings discussed in the Introduction: crowd-out and complementarity.
To see the "crowd-out" e¤ect, note that post-Internet teachers on islands j = 2; :::; N will
reallocate their time from instructional tasks in the complete task interval, [0; 1]; to hands-on
instruction tasks in the subinterval ( ; 1]. Since there are diminishing returns to each teaching task
i, this "crowd-out" will tend to depress teachers marginal products and earnings. If we compare
(5), with the counterfactual assumption that h1 = hj , to (3), we quantify this "crowd-out" e¤ect
and nd that wj0 < wj .

One can imagine that if the time and e¤ort of teachers on island 1 are diverted to Internet-related activities,
students on this island might be made worse o¤. Countering this, if teachers could increase the time they devote to
lecturing, this would increase their remuneration and may attract more talented, or simply more, agents into teaching.
This would tend to bene t students on this island.

6

The "complementarity" e¤ect, on the other hand, is captured by the fact that h1 > hj 
inputs complementary to the services of local teachers have now increased, pushing up the marginal
product and earnings of local teachers.
Combining these two e¤ects and directly comparing (5) to (3), we see that the wages of domestic
teachers on island j will increase if and only if

This expression will be satis ed if island js teachers are not too close, in terms of their skills, to
the teachers on island 1. However, the wages of teachers on islands with hj su¢ciently close to h1
(whom we call "middle skill" teachers) will fall.
In fact, we can use equation (6) to provide an explicit threshold at which a marginal introduction
of web-based education (i.e.,

close to zero) will increase local teachers wages. Taking logs on

both sides of equation (6), we see that teachers wages on island j will increase if and only if

Our model also implies that there will be no change in the wages of teachers on island 1. This is a consequence
of the fact that the pre- and post-Internet allocations on this island are identical: a fraction of teachers are still
working on lecturing tasks and the remaining 1  are working on hands-on instruction. The latter have the same
marginal product as before, in terms of their contribution to student human capital. Several assumptions we have
made for simplicity are important for this result. For example, if the amount of time teachers on island 1 devote to
lecturing could increase, if there were human capital di¤erences among these teachers, or if agents with higher human
capital could enter teaching, then the earnings of island 1 teachers would also increase in the post-Internet allocation.
Nevertheless, this result highlights that any increase in inequality between the very top teachers and the rest in the
post-Internet era may be limited.

Conclusion

There is substantial uncertainty about the ultimate impact of web-based educational innovations.
Our stylized model suggests that, in contrast to the disequalizing e¤ects of many other disruptive
technologies, web-based education will have broadly equalizing e¤ects. Not only will human capital
around the globe be enhanced, but human capital inequality may also decrease. At the same time,
many (though not all) teachers will prosper.
Our model was purposefully chosen to be highly simpli ed, and thus leaves out many relevant
and interesting issues. First, we have abstracted from occupational choice. Changes in teachers
wages will induce entry and exit from this occupation. This is potentially complicated by the fact
that web-based technologies will also change wages in non-teaching occupations.
Second, a major issue in the economics of education is changing costs. On the one hand, these
new web-based technologies require computers and broadband access, which are costly for students
in many regions. On the other hand, these new technologies will economize on textbooks and other
non-web resources. Our analysis also suggests that the teacher wage bill may increase or decrease.
Third, we have abstracted from within-country inequality of student endowments. For example,
web-based education may be less equalizing if the already-advantaged students have disproportionate access to the web. The extent of this e¤ect, especially its magnitude relative to the equalizing
e¤ects we have identi ed, is an interesting area for empirical study.
Finally, web-based delivery of educational resources may lower the cost of experimenting with
new teaching techniques and acquiring feedback on what works and why. These experiments may
lead us to deeper insights about the education production function. In this way, recent educational
innovations may not only help us teach our students; they may also help us teach ourselves.
