    "abstract": "\n\nHigh skilled workers gain from face to face interactions.  If the skilled can move at higher speeds, then knowledge diffusion and idea spillovers are likely to reach greater distances.  This paper uses the construction of China\u2019s high speed rail (HSR) network as a natural experiment to test this claim.  HSR connects major cities, that feature the nation\u2019s best universities, to secondary cities.  Since bullet trains reduce cross-city commute times, they reduce the cost of face-to-face interactions between skilled workers who work in different cities.  Using a data base listing research paper publication and citations, we document a complementarity effect between knowledge production and the transportation network.  Co-authors\u2019 productivity rises and more new co-author pairs emerge when secondary cities are connected by bullet train to China\u2019s major cities.\n\n",
