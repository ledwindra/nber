    "abstract": "\n\nFirms may be reluctant to provide general training if workers can quit and use their gained skills elsewhere. \u201cTraining contracts\u201d that impose a penalty for premature quitting can help alleviate this inefficiency. Using plausibly exogenous contractual variation from a leading trucking firm, we show that two training contracts significantly reduced post-training quitting, particularly when workers are approaching the end of their contracts. Simulating a structural model, we show that observed worker quit behavior exhibits aspects of optimization (for one of the two contracts), and that the contracts increased firm profits from training and reduced worker welfare relative to no contract.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nA previous paper appeared as \u201cTraining Contracts, Worker Overconfidence, and the Return from Firm-Sponsored General Training.\u201d That previous paper has been divided in two, with the present paper focusing on the impact of training contracts. The other paper (Hoffman and Burks, 2017) focuses on worker overconfidence and uses a different dataset (though also based on workers from Firm A). Some portions of text are similar across the two papers. We are very grateful to David Card, Stefano DellaVigna, John Morgan, and Steve Tadelis for their encouragement and advice. We also thank Ben Handel, Ben Hermalin, Ken Judd, Pat Kline, Botond Koszegi, Matthew Rabin, and Kenneth Train for especially detailed comments, and we also thank many seminar/conference participants. We thank the many trucking managers and drivers who shared their insights with us. We thank managers at Firms A for sharing their data and for facilitating on-site data collection. We thank Mark Gergen, Anthony Kraus, and Gregory Lemmer for guidance in understanding relevant legal issues. We thank Graham Beattie, Christina Chew, Dan Ershov, Sandrena Frischer, Will Kuffel, Amol Lingnurkar, Kristjan Sigurdson, and Irina Titova for outstanding research assistance.
