Transferability of Migration Licenses and the Distribution of Potential Rents

ABSTRACT
This paper compares the effects of migration restrictions using licenses which are freely traded
in a competitive labor market to those that occur when licenses are allocated to firms who are not
permitted to trade them. There is reason to expect that a policy of making licenses non-transferable will
not only affect production efficiency, but also to allow producers to capture more of the potential
migration rents. Applications to migration policies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are
discussed.

1. Introduction
While there is a large body of work on the eﬀects of international labor mobility,
and on the brain drain, see for example Bhagwati (1976) and Hamada (1975),
there has been relatively little written on how implementation and diﬀerences in
implementation aﬀect migration patterns and rents. There are major diﬀerences
between countries in the extent of migration and in the way that migration policies
are implemented. Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consisting
of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates,
have fairly high proportions of migrant workers. They comprise approximately 55
percent of the labor force in Bahrain, 65-70 percent of the labor force in Oman
and Saudi Arabia, and 85-90 percent in Kuwait, Qatar, and in the United Arab
Emirates. One of the most commonly adopted migration policies is the allocation
of migrant work permits to domestic Þrms, where migrant labor must be sponsored
by a Þrm in the host country. These permits are only good for a short time period,
anywhere from six months up to two years and the sponsorship is usually nontransferable. This means that once a migrant worker has entered the country to
work for a Þrm they must leave the country and reapply to be able to work for
a diﬀerent Þrm. On the other hand, in many western countries, the prerequisites
for temporary or permanent migration are capital investment of a suitable sum in
the host country, having close relatives who are citizens, or having needed skills.
In most cases, the permit is with the migrant, not the employer, and it is often
permanent, not temporary.
In this paper we compare the eﬀects of transferable permits to ones which are
allocated to Þrms who cannot trade them. The latter is similar to the way labor
markets work in the GCC countries. For this reason we provide some background
on these countries next.
1.1. Some Features of Labor Markets in GCC Countries
In the aftermath of the oil price increases of 1973 and 1974 severe labor shortages
quickly developed in most of the GCC countries. The labor shortages were for
both skilled and unskilled labor. With increasing government expenditures, especially the implementation of large public infrastructure projects, there was an
increased demand for both technical and professional skills as well as blue-collar labor. Also, the many-fold increase in personal incomes led to an immediate demand
for labor in the household service sectors. The labor shortage was ameliorated by
an inßux of foreign labor arriving mostly from other Middle Eastern countries.
2

Initially, migrant labor was either not regulated or the existing migration quotas
were not strictly enforced in most of the GCC countries.
In the 1980’s and 1990’s real wages of domestic workers stagnated and population growth rates increased to over four percent in several GCC countries. This
led to migrant labor policies becoming increasingly stringent in an eﬀort to protect domestic jobs and wages. Today, despite stricter permit regulations, demand
for migrant labor remains high. One of the major factors inßuencing this continuing demand for migrant labor is the attitude of GCC nationals towards private
sector jobs. The wealth of the oil boom was partially distributed to nationals in
the form of guaranteed government jobs at inßated wages with generous beneÞt
packages. These beneÞts often meet or even exceed the base salary. For example,
paid leave and shorter working hours allow employees to conduct private business
after working hours. Thus the government has become the employer of Þrst and
last resort. The extent of this can be seen in Kuwait, where over 90 percent of the
national labor force is employed in the public sector. This gives nationals very
high reservation wages and very little incentive to educate themselves in skills
that are in demand by the private sector. Public subsidization of education for
nationals, even to the point of making education free, has not curbed the shortage of skilled domestic workers. On the demand side, legislation that makes it
diﬃcult to Þre a national working in the private sector makes it less attractive to
hire locals. In response to growing unemployment, policies that restrict the use of
migrant labor or encourage the use of domestic workers have been implemented.
These are politically more popular than structural reform of the labor market.
However, one only has to look at the steadily rising unemployment Þgures to see
that these restrictive migration policies are not working. Unemployment rates are
already far higher than anything oﬃcially admitted and unoﬃcial estimates range
from 20% in Oman and 25% in Saudi Arabia up to 30% in Bahrain.1
There is little work in the literature that analyzes implementation diﬀerences
of migration policies.2 In this paper we deal with one such diﬀerence: namely the
implication, in the short run, of allocating migration permits to Þrms in an exogenous manner and making them non-transferable. Krishna and Tan (1999) take
a diﬀerent approach where they compare transferability and non-transferability
of licenses with uncertainty of license prices. They consider a two period model
where license purchases are chosen in the Þrst period and the value of the license

The closest paper to ours is Djajic (1989) who uses the same framework to look at traditional
questions such as the eﬀects of migration on trade ßows.

is realized in the second period. They show that the price of a license is higher
under non transferability if the quota is less restrictive than a given level and vice
versa otherwise. In contrast, since there is no uncertainty in our model, and as
licenses are allocated based on historical shares and political connections, we take
the allocation of licenses as given and look at the eﬀects of transferability and
non-transferability on the distribution of license rents.
Domestic and foreign eﬀective labor may be perfect substitutes or imperfect
substitutes. We allow workers within each country to be of diﬀering abilities where
each ability type provides a certain amount of eﬀective labor. These abilities are
assumed to be observable by Þrms. In our setting this is equivalent to assuming
that Þrms can oﬀer a piece rate wage. If licenses are sold in a competitive market,
the owner of the license obtains the license rents and the highest skilled workers
from abroad enter the domestic country. The same results are obtained when
licenses are initially allocated to Þrms and the licenses are transferable. Migrants,
other than the marginal ones, are better oﬀ migrating so that potential license
rents are shared.
What if licenses are allocated to Þrms and are not transferable? If domestic
and foreign labor are homogeneous and the allocation of licenses is such that
all Þrms employ both domestic and foreign labor in equilibrium, then all Þrms
have the same marginal product of eﬀective labor which is equal to the domestic
wage. Firms with more licenses merely reap more rents. In this case there is
no diﬀerence in the distribution of licenses rents from the transferable case and
no eﬃciency loss. However, if the allocation of licenses is severely distorted, so
that some Þrms employ only foreign labor, then there will be an eﬃciency loss
if the marginal product of labor is not equalized across all Þrms. We show that
Þrms with less binding, or larger allocations of licenses will oﬀer employment to
lower quality migrants. However, economy-wide the same migrant labor types
enter as would have had the licenses been transferable. Thus, one might ask what
is the eﬀect of distorted non-transferable licenses on the domestic economy? In
addition to the ineﬃciency caused by Þrms having diﬀerent marginal products
of eﬀective labor, and hence not being on the production possibility frontier, we
show that this will reduce the share of migration rents to migrant workers given
certain conditions on the production function. If domestic and foreign labor are
imperfectly substitutable, then the outcome is similar to that in the distorted
homogeneous labor case.
We proceed as follows. In Section 2 we set up our basic model where domestic
and foreign labor are perfect substitutes. We Þrst look at transferable licenses
4

so that marginal products of eﬀective labor are equalized across Þrms. We then
look at non-transferable licenses where the marginal products of eﬀective labor
need not be equalized across Þrms, and Þnally, at the many Þrm case. In Section
3 we extend our analysis to the case with imperfect labor substitutes. Section 4
contains some Þnal thoughts.

2. Perfect Substitutes
There are two countries, domestic and foreign. There are a large number of
identical Þrms in the domestic country with three factors of production, capital,
domestic eﬀective labor and foreign eﬀective labor. There is a single good produced using the factors of production, which has a price of unity. Let domestic
and foreign wages per eﬀective unit of labor be represented by w, w ∗ . We assume
that the foreign country is large so that its wage is Þxed. The transportation
costs of migration are assumed to be zero. The equilibrium domestic wage per
eﬀective labor unit, w, is determined in a general equilibrium framework where
the equilibrium wage is a function of the total number of licenses allocated in the
economy.
Workers are distributed over a continuum of ability types, θ ∈ [0, 1]. One
unit of type θ labor is equivalent to θ units of eﬀective labor. The function g(θ)
represents the density function over labor types at home and abroad, while N
and N ∗ denote the population size of the domestic and foreign countries. For
simplicity, we assume that g(θ) is uniform.
In order to model the GCC migrant labor market more closely, we assume
that migration permits are allocated to Þrms in the domestic country. Each Þrm
is initially allocated
P Qi licenses. The total migration licenses allocated in the
economy is Q = Qi . Each worker must have a migration permit to enter and
i

work in the domestic country.
2.1. Transferable Licenses

The symmetric two Þrm model where foreign and domestic labor are perfectly
substitutable is illustrated in Figure 1. The total eﬀective labor in the domestic
economy from domestic and migrant workers is measured on theR horizontal axis,
1
where E is the size of the domestic labor force and E ∗ = N ∗ θ θg(θ)dθ is the
size of the migrant labor force given that Q licenses are allocated in the economy

and that θ is the marginal migrant worker that chooses to work in the domestic
country. The marginal product of eﬀective labor of each Þrm is measured on the
vertical axis. We will show that Þrms will use the same amount of eﬀective labor,
e, if licenses are transferable.
The competitive equilibrium can be constructed assuming that Þrms can identify foreign labor by its type and oﬀer a wage schedule, W (θ), over labor types.
To hire a migrant worker Þrms also incur the cost of either buying a license at
the market price or forgoing the beneÞt of selling the license to another Þrm.
The cost of hiring a migrant worker thus takes the form W (θ) + L, where W (θ)
is the wage oﬀered for each ability type and L is the market price of a license.3
The equilibrium wage schedule oﬀered to migrant workers must have the following
properties.
1. Indiﬀerence: A Þrm must be equally well oﬀ whichever type of labor it ends
up hiring. If this was not the case, the preferred workers would have their wages
bid up. This implies that each Þrm must have the same cost per eﬀective unit of
labor independent of which skill type it hires.
The indiﬀerence property can be written as
W (θ) + L
W (θ0 ) + L
= w for all θ, θ0 that are hired by the Þrms.

Since each license allows the Þrm to hire one worker rather than one eﬀective labor unit,
the license price does not depend on the type of the worker.

a higher (lower) wage than the going one will have excess supply (demand) so
all Þrms must oﬀer the same eﬀective wage. Hence the wage schedule oﬀered to
migrant workers will be,
W (θ) = wθ − L.

(2)

In Figure 2, the domestic wage schedule is given by the line 0w and the foreign
wage schedule is given by the line 0w∗ , where skill types are measured on the horizontal axis and wages received are measured on the vertical axis. The equilibrium
wage schedule oﬀered to migrant workers, W (θ), is just the domestic wage schedule shifted down by the value of a migration license, L, which is a function of the
total license allocation. The marginal migrant worker, θ, is determined so that
only Q workers enter. For migration to exist it must be that w > w∗ . Since the
diﬀerence in wages from migrating is increasing in the productivity of a worker,
only the highest types will migrate. Potential rents are shared between domestic
Þrms and migrant workers as migrants, other than the marginal ones, are better
oﬀ migrating than not.
What is the equilibrium license price L? Since the marginal migrant worker,
θ, will be indiﬀerent between migrating and receiving a wage of wθ − L or not
migrating and receiving w ∗ θ, this gives us,
L = [w − w ∗ ]θ.

2. Market Clearing: Domestic wages are such that the horizontal sum of the
marginal value product of eﬀective labor across all Þrms equals total eﬀective labor
supply E + E ∗ . We assume that Þrms are symmetric other than their license
allocations and have a Þxed factor K so that labor has diminishing marginal
product. If license are transferable, or they are not transferable but all Þrms are
willing to hire some domestic labor, then all Þrms must be indiﬀerent between
hiring domestic and foreign labor and w must be the marginal value product of
an eﬀective unit of foreign labor as well. The license price can be interpreted as
the shadow beneÞt of a license and Þrms with more licenses have more rents. In
equilibrium all Þrms oﬀer the same wage per eﬀective unit of labor, employ the
∗
same amount of eﬀective labor denoted by EiT = E+E
, where M is the number
M
of Þrms, and employ the average quality of migrant labor that is hired in the
domestic country.
2.2. Non-transferable Licenses
Why use non-transferable migration licenses in GCC countries? Clearly this migration policy is ineﬃcient from a labor allocation perspective. However, with
non-transferable licenses, under certain conditions, Þrms oﬀer a wage schedule in
equilibrium that gives them a greater portion of the license rents from migration!
Since licenses are often allocated in GCC countries on the basis of political ties,
distorted license allocations are common. For example, in Kuwait, once a Þrm
is licensed to operate it must apply to the Ministry of Social Aﬀairs and Labor
for a certain allocation of workers where this allocation is based on an inspection
by staﬀ of the Ministry. Political connections play a large role in the number of
licenses that each Þrm is allocated. In addition, the percentage of the national

labor force that is employed in the private sector of GCC countries is usually very
small, in Kuwait 90 percent of the labor force in the private sector are migrant
workers, so the allocation of licenses does not necessarily need to be very skewed
in order for at least one Þrm to hire only migrant labor.
Firms will not use the same amount of eﬀective labor in production if their
marginal products of eﬀective labor are not the same. What license allocation
will lead to a diﬀerence in the marginal products of eﬀective labor? With perfect
substitutability of domestic and migrant labor the marginal product of eﬀective
labor for Firm i is F1i (Ei + Ei∗ , Ki ). Let Ki = K for all Þrms so that Þrms are
identical apart from their license allocations. Again, consider the two Þrm case.
In Figure 3, the wage per eﬀective unit of labor for each Þrm is graphed on the
vertical axis and the quota allocation is graphed on the horizontal axis where Q1
is the number of licenses allocated to Firm 1.
Assume both Þrms are allocated the same number of licenses, Q2 . As the license
allocation to Firm 1 increases, both Þrms can initially adjust the mix of domestic
and foreign labor in order to use the same amount of eﬀective labor units. When
they hire the same number of eﬀective units of labor, the outcome is the same
as the transferable case. This will occur until Firm 1 hires only migrant labor.
Let the smallest quota allocation such that Firm 1 uses only migrant labor be
deÞned as Q1 = Qh1 . Of course at this allocation, Firm 2 must be using all of the
domestic labor in the economy as well as some migrant workers. For Q2 ≤ Q1 < Qh1 ,
both Þrms hire the same average quality of workers, and use the same amount of
eﬀective labor.

so that Qh1 [1 − 2N

only foreign labor (of the average quality), Firm 2 hires all the domestic labor as
well as the remaining foreign labor, and both hire the same total eﬀective labor.
As total eﬀective labor is E + E ∗ , each uses half of this. Thus

As Q1 increases beyond Qh1 , Þrms can hire the same amount of eﬀective labor by
hiring diﬀerent migrant labor types. This will be possible until Firm 1 is hiring the
lowest productivity type workers and Firm 2 is hiring the highest productivity type
workers. Denote the smallest quota allocation to Firm 1 such that Firm 1 uses only

types choosing to migrate and so cannot lower its average quality any further. Let

Finally, for Q1 > QH
1 , Firm 1 hires more eﬀective labor than Firm 2 and hence
has a lower marginal product of eﬀective labor, w1 .
In such cases we say that the allocation of licenses is severely distorted. Since
Firm 2 employs both domestic and foreign workers, w2 is also the domestic wage
per eﬀective unit of labor and w2 > w1 . The allocations Qh2 and QH
2 are symmetrically deÞned and depicted in Figure 3.
The wage schedules oﬀered to migrant workers when Þrms have diﬀerent
marginal products of eﬀective labor, that is, when Q1 > QH
1 , are represented
in Figure 4. In a competitive equilibrium each Þrm must still be indiﬀerent between all of the labor types that it hires. Hence, (2) still holds for each Þrm
though if they oﬀer diﬀerent wages, they attract diﬀerent workers so that
Wi (θ) = wi θ − Li .

(12)

Since w2 > w1 , L2 must be more than L1 for Firm 1 to attract any foreign workers.
Since higher quality workers value a higher w more than do lower quality ones,
Firm 2 attracts the highest worker types and Li is determined to ensure that
the number of migrant workers in each Þrm equals its license allocation. Let θ 2
denote the marginal worker hired by Firm 2 and recall that θ denotes the marginal
which implicitly deÞnes η(QH
1 ), while (11) gives

migrant worker in the domestic economy. The number of workers between θ and
θ2 must equal Q1 and L1 must be such that it shifts the θw1 line down to go
through the point (θ, w ∗ θ) , while L2 must be such that it shifts the θw2 line
down to go through the point (θ 2 , w1 θ2 − L1 ). Note that the worker of type θ2 is
indiﬀerent between working for either Þrm.
Q2
With θ distributed uniformly, θ 2 = 1 − N
∗ and these conditions boil down to
w2 θ2 − L2 = w1 θ2 − L1

(13)

w1 θ − L1 = w∗ θ.

As the total eﬀective labor from abroad is unchanged from the transferable case, if
w2 > w1 then Firm 1 hires more eﬀective labor than it did under transferability
while Firm 2 hires less. Hence w2 > w > w1 so that domestic eﬀective labor which
earns w2 is better oﬀ.
What are the eﬀects of a skewed allocation of non-transferable licenses on
the distribution of license rents? Since w2 > w > w1 and both w1 θ − L1 and
wθ − L emanate from the point (θ, wθ − L) in Figure 4, it is clear that the wages
of low quality migrant workers must be lower under non-transferability when the
allocation of licenses is severely distorted. However, it is not clear that the migrant
workers types hired by Firm 2 must earn less.
With transferable licenses, from (3) and (5), the wage schedule oﬀered to
migrant workers by all Þrms is
L2 = [w2 − w1 ][1 −

(17)

where w T is the marginal product of eﬀective labor when both Þrms use the same

is

W2 (θ) = w2 θ − [w2 − w1 ][1 − ∗ ] − [w1 − w∗ ][1 − ∗ ].

Comparing (17) and (18), each migrant worker type hired by Firm 2 will make
less under non-transferability if
[wT − w1 ]Q1 + N ∗ [w T − w2 ][1 − θ] > [w2 − wT ]Q2 .

(19)

If this condition holds for the highest type worker, θ = 1, then clearly it will also
hold for all worker types hired by Firm 2. For θ = 1, Equation (19) simpliÞes to
[wT − w1 ]Q1 > [w2 − w T ]Q2 .
In Figure 3, area A is [w T − w1 ]Q1 and area B is [w2 − wT ]Q2 . So the condition
holds as long as A is greater than B.
When might this be true? Notice that at Q1 = QH
1 , areas A and B disappear.
As we just start to increase the quota allocation to Firm 1 from Q1 = QH
1 , area
A is looks like it has to exceed than area B since Firm 1 has a larger allocation of
quota licenses. This suggests that for license allocations close to Q1 = QH
1 , migrant
workers hired by both Þrms will make less under non-transferability. Moreover,
this remains true for all Q1 > QH
1 with a Cobb-Douglas production function. We
show this formally below.
Theorem 1 When licenses are non-transferable and all Þrms do not have the
same marginal product of eﬀective labor the following will be true:
(1) All migrant workers hired by the Þrm with the largest allocation of licenses
will receive lower wages than when licenses are transferable,
(2) With two Þrms and g(.) uniform, workers hired by the Þrm with the smaller
H
allocation of licenses will also earn less for all Q1 ∈ (QH
1 , Q1 + A) for A small
enough.
(3) With two Þrms and g(.) uniform, workers hired by the Þrm with the smaller
allocation of licenses earn less for all Q1 ∈ (QH
1 , Q̄) if the production function for
both Þrms takes a Cobb-Douglas form.
Proof. In the Appendix.
2.3. Many Firms
We now generalize these conditions to the M Þrm case. Here there are two types
of Þrms, type 1 and type 2, where we assume that, Q1 , the license allocation to
each Þrm of type 1 is greater than, Q2 , the license allocation to each Þrm of type
13

2. There are µM symmetric Þrms of type 1 and [1 − µ]M symmetric Þrms of type
2, where µ denotes the proportion of Þrms that are of type 1. Let Q equal the
total number of licenses in the domestic economy, where
Q = M [µQ1 + [1 − µ]Q2 ].

(20)

A change in M implies that the number of Þrms has changed but that the proportion of Þrms of each type remains constant. This implies that an increase in
M leads to a proportional decrease in Q1 and Q2 , as the total number of licenses
in the economy is constant. A change in µ implies that the proportion of type 1
Þrms has changed but the number of Þrms remains constant. From (20), with Q
Þxed, µQ1 + [1 − µ]Q2 must be constant. Keeping Q1 Þxed, this implies that an
increase in µ must lead to a decrease in Q2 , as Q1 is assumed to be greater than
Q2 .
h
How do M and µ aﬀect Qh1 and QH
1 ? Again Q1 is the minimum allocation to
each Þrm of type 1 such that it uses only migrant labor. As before, equating the
eﬀective labor used by a Þrm of type 1, which is the number of licenses times the
average migrant worker type, to each Þrms’ share of the total eﬀective labor in
the economy, gives

From (21), Qh1 is independent of µ and decreasing linearly in M . This is illustrated
in Figure 5, with M1 graphed on the horizontal axis and Q1 graphed on the vertical
axis. Intuitively, the point at which Þrms of type 1 can no longer trade oﬀ domestic
for migrant labor only depends on the number of licenses each type 1 Þrm is
allocated. As the number of Þrms increases, the allocation of licenses to each Þrm
decreases. Thus, the point at which Þrms of type 1 are no longer able to trade
oﬀ domestic for foreign labor occurs earlier and Qh1 falls as M rises. However,
increasing the proportion of type 1 Þrms, does not aﬀect Qh1 . This follows as we
have assumed that the number of licenses allocated to each type 1 Þrm is constant
when µ changes.

What about QH

that if a given allocation, Q1 , is initially below QH

Theorem 2 With many Þrms using non-transferable licenses, and Þrms not having the same marginal product of eﬀective labor, the following will be true:
(1) All migrant workers hired by the Þrm(s) with the largest allocation of
licenses will receive lower wages than when licenses are transferable,
(2) With g(.) uniform, and assuming the total licenses allocated to Þrms of
type 1 is greater than the total licenses allocated to Þrms of type 2, workers hired
H
by type 2 Þrms will also earn less for all Q1 ∈ (QH
1 , Q1 + A) for A small enough.
(3) With g(.) uniform, and assuming the total licenses allocated to Þrms of
type 1 is greater than the total licenses allocated to Þrms of type 2, workers hired
by type 2 Þrms earn less for all Q1 ∈ (QH
1 , Q) if the production function for all
Þrms takes a Cobb-Douglas form.
Proof. In the Appendix.
Intuitively, part (1) holds as w1 < wT < w2 when Þrms do not have the
same marginal product of migrant eﬀective labor and Q1 > Q2 . Part (2) can be
understood by noting that at QH
1 , all Þrms have the same wage. If the license
allocation to all type 1 Þrms is very small, then the decrease in their marginal
product of migrant eﬀective labor from an increase in Q1 implies only a small
shift down in the aggregate wage schedule, W (θ). Thus, migrant workers of type
θ = 1, will not earn less by being hired by Þrms of type 2. Only when the total
license allocation to type 1 Þrms is at least half of the total license allocation in
the economy will all workers hired by Þrms of type 2 earn less. For part (3), the
16

same condition applies. When the production function is Cobb-Douglas w1 falls
at a slower rate than w2 rises, as Q1 increases. A suﬃcient condition for workers
of type θ = 1 to earn less working for Þrms of type 2 remains that the total license
allocation to Þrms of type 1 be greater than the total license allocation to Þrms
of type 2.

3. Imperfect Substitutes
In this section we ask whether our results go through when domestic and foreign
labor are imperfect substitutes. We show that the outcomes are similar. If a Þrm
has more licenses than the other one, then for a while it will be able to hire the
same eﬀective foreign labor by hiring diﬀerent qualities of migrant labor. After a
point, namely when it is using the lowest quality migrant labor, it can no longer
do so and it hires more eﬀective foreign labor than the other Þrm and has a lower
marginal product of foreign labor.
For simplicity, assume that all Þrms are ex ante identical and have a production
function, F (E, E ∗ , K). Take the optimal choice of E for every given value of E ∗ , w
and K and denote it by E(E ∗ , w, K). This is implicitly deÞned by
FE (E, E ∗ , K) = w.

(26)

Substitute E(E ∗ , K) for E in the production function. Let
f (E ∗ , K, w) = F (E(E ∗ , K), E ∗ , K).
Now deÞne the direct and indirect marginal product of a unit of E ∗ as
fE∗ (E ∗ , K, w) = FE (E(.), E ∗ , K)EE ∗ (E ∗ , w, K) + FE∗ (E(.), E ∗ , K).
If domestic and foreign labor are substitutes (complements), then an increase in E ∗
shifts in (out) the marginal value product of E, resulting in a reduction (increase)
in the optimal choice of E so that E(E ∗ ) is downward (upward) sloping. When
choosing E ∗ , the Þrm looks at its net marginal value product, gE ∗ (E ∗ , K, w), where
g(E ∗ , K, w) = (f (E ∗ , K, w) − wE(E ∗ )).
Using the Envelope theorem the marginal product is just
gE∗ (E ∗ , K, w) = FE (E(.), E ∗ , K)EE∗ (E ∗ , w, K) + FE ∗ (E(.), E ∗ , K) − wEE∗ (E ∗ , w, K)
= FE ∗ (E(.), E ∗ , K).

This is the demand for migrant eﬀective labor as a function of migrant eﬀective
labor, capital, and the domestic wage per eﬀective labor unit.
Assuming concavity of F (E, E ∗ , K),
gE ∗ E∗ (.) = FE ∗ E EE∗ + FE∗ E∗ < 0.
Now that we have a direct and indirect willingness to pay for E ∗ , or a demand
curve, we need to derive the supply side of the labor market. Let each Þrm be
allocated Qi non-transferable licenses. To derive the supply schedule of migrant
eﬀective labor that Þrms face we need to look at the relationship between the
equilibrium wage per eﬀective unit of labor received by migrant workers and the
eﬀective labor units supplied to each Þrm.
We continue to use two Þrms to illustrate this. As discussed in previous sections, Þrms oﬀer a wage schedule to migrant workers of
Wi (θ) = wi∗ θ − Li

where wi∗ is the equilibrium wage per eﬀective unit of migrant labor for each Þrm
and Li is the transfer payment oﬀered to each Þrm by a migrant worker. If Firm
1 oﬀers a wage per eﬀective unit of labor less than that of the rest of the world,
that is, w1∗ ≤ w∗ , they will not be able to hire any migrant workers from abroad.
In this range, the supply schedule for eﬀective labor is inelastic and equal to zero
as seen in Figure 6.
If Firm 1 oﬀers a wage per eﬀective unit of labor greater than w ∗ the productivity types and eﬀective migrant labor supplied to them depends on the wage

oﬀered by Firm 2. If Firm 2 oﬀers a higher wage, then only the lowest worker types
migrating choose to work for Firm 1 since high worker types value the higher wage
per eﬀective unit of labor more than low worker types. This is depicted in Figure
7 − a. Thus for w2∗ > w1∗ > w∗ , the supply of eﬀective labor for Firm 1 is vertical
∗1
as depicted in Figure 6. If Firm 1 oﬀers a wage equal to that of Firm
at Elow
∗1
2, it can certainly get a supply of Elow
if it hires only the lowest quality foreign
workers. However, if it hires the highest quality, and this is no problem as workers
are indiﬀerent between working for the two Þrms, there is a discrete jump in the
∗1
eﬀective labor hired by Firm 1 and it can hire as many as Ehigh
units of foreign
∗1
eﬀective labor. Hence it faces a supply curve which is horizontal between Elow
∗1
and Ehigh
. In Figure 7 − b, for any w1∗ > w2∗ , the highest worker types that migrate
∗1
.
choose to work for Firm 1 and the supply of eﬀective labor is vertical at Ehigh
The bids oﬀered by migrant workers to both Þrms adjust such that the marginal
worker hired by each Þrm is indiﬀerent between working for that Þrm and their
best alternative available.
We can go through a similar process to derive the supply schedule facing Firm
2. Note that an increase in the number of licenses shifts this supply curve to the
right. The intersection of the supply schedule, which depends on the allocation of
licenses, and the demand curve, which is common to all Þrms, gives the shadow
price of a unit of E ∗ or the wage per eﬀective unit of migrant labor for each Þrm
in equilibrium. Figure 6 depicts Firm 2 as having the smaller allocation of licenses
and thus a higher shadow price of a unit of E ∗ where the supply schedule for Firm
2 is to the left of the supply schedule

1 is the highest quota

is QH

the supply schedule for Firm 2 shifts to the left. A higher license allocation for
Firm 1 when Q1 > QH
1 must result in a lower equilibrium wage oﬀered to migrant
workers by Firm 1 and a higher wage oﬀered by Firm 2 as illustrated in Figure
6. It is easy to see that the Þrst two parts of Theorem 1 remain true even when
domestic and foreign labor are diﬀerentiated. Part (3) is shown in the Appendix
where migrant and foreign eﬀective labor now enter separately in the production
function.

4. Conclusion
Throughout this paper we have looked at how implementation of migration policies
can aﬀect both the allocation of worker types amongst Þrms in the economy and
the eﬃciency of the economy as a whole. In particular, when licenses are nontransferable and Þrms do not have the same marginal product of eﬀective labor,
Þrms oﬀer diﬀerent wage schedules to migrant workers in equilibrium, there are
eﬃciency losses in the economy, and under certain conditions a greater share of
migration rents accrue to Þrms. Similar results are obtained when domestic and
foreign labor inputs are not perfect substitutes and allocations of licenses are
unequal. This may be a reason why non-transferable migration licenses are used
in GCC countries where Þrms have a considerable amount of political power.

5. Appendix
Proof of Theorem 1 Part (1) follows as w1 < wT < w2 for all Q1 ∈ (QH
1 , Q̄).
For parts (2) and (3) we need to test whether or not [wT − w1 ]Q1 − [w2 −
wT ][Q − Q1 ] > 0. This condition becomes
w T Q > w1 Q1 + w2 Q2 .

(27)

Since the left hand side is constant, if we show that the right hand side of
i
(27) is decreasing in Q1 at QH
1 , we will have shown part (2). Let F1 be the
21

marginal product of eﬀective labor for Firm i. Taking the derivative of both
sides, and evaluating it at Q1 = QH

Since this is a strict inequality, (28) holds in a small region close to QH

which proves the second part of Theorem 1.
If we show that the right hand side of (27) is decreasing in Q1 at all Q1 ≥ QH

for a Cobb-Douglas production function, we will have shown part (3).

d log w
=α−1
d log E ∗
so that (30) becomes
w2 − w1 > [α − 1][w1 [1 + ψ] − w2 [1 − φ]].

(31)

Rearranging terms gives (31) to be
[w2 − w1 ]α > [α − 1][w1 ψ + w2 φ]].
The left hand side is positive when Q1 > QH
1 since [w2 − w1 ] > 0 in this
case. The right hand side is negative as α < 1. Hence, this inequality always
holds! This completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 2 Here let Q1 and Q2 be the number of licenses allocated to
each Þrm of type 1 and type 2 respectively. If there are µM Þrms of type
1 and [1 − µ]M Þrms of type 2 the total license allocation to Þrms of type
1 and type 2 are µM Q1 and [1 − µ]M Q2 . Let Q equal the total number of
licenses in the domestic economy, where Q = M [µQ1 + [1 − µ]Q2 ].

Part (1) holds by construction as w1 < w T < w2 for all Q1 ∈ (QH
1 , Q).
For parts (2) and (3), we again need to check whether all workers hired by
Þrms of type 2 earn less with non-transferable licenses for the conditions
stated above in Theorem 2. In the two Þrm case this condition is given by
23

W (θ) > W2 (θ), and if this holds for θ = 1 it will hold for all other migrant
worker types. Expanded, this condition is
∗
w T − [wT − w∗ ]θ > w2 − [w2 − w1 ]η(QH
1 ) − [w1 − w ]θ.

The lowest worker type, θ, is only a function of Q. A change in the total
number of Þrms will not aﬀect the lowest worker type or η(QH
1 ) as shown
earlier.
Thus, our condition becomes
H
wT [1 − θ] > w2 [1 − η(QH
1 )] + w1 [η(Q1 ) − θ].

(32)

With a uniform distribution, the lowest migrant worker type is
θ =1−

Q
.
N∗

(33)

The highest migrant worker type hired by type 1 Þrms equals the lowest
migrant worker type in the economy, θ, plus the number of workers hired by
Þrms of type 1, where

(34)

Substituting (34) and (33) into (32) and multiplying both sides by N ∗ gives
w T Q > w2 [Q − µM Q1 ] + w1 µM Q1 .

(35)

Equation (35) can also be written as
[wT − w1 ]µMQ1 > [w2 − w T ][Q − µM Q1 ].
Intuitively, when Q1 > QH
1 , all migrant workers hired by Þrms of type 2
earn less under non-transferability if the total decrease in wages lost by
Þrms of type 1, [wT − w1 ]µMQ1 , is greater than the total gain in wages
for Þrms of type 2, [w2 − wT ][Q − µM Q1 ]. Since Q1 > Q2 by assumption,

More formally, since the left hand side of (35) is constant, if the right hand
side of (35) is decreasing in Q1 at QH

Rearranging terms gives (40) to be
w2 [1 − [α − 1]

[1 − µ]
[1 − µ]
] − w1 α > [α − 1][w1 ψ + w2 φ

(41)

The right hand side is negative as α < 1. Since w2 > w1 , the right hand
side will always be positive when
1 − [α − 1]

[1 − µ]
> α.

Rearranging, this becomes

[1 − µ]

or

Again if µM Q1 > Q2 , µ is minimized at Q = M Q1 . This implies that µ > 12 .
As such, the right hand side of (41) is always positive. Hence, this inequality
holds when the total license allocation to Þrms of type 1 is greater than half
of the migration licenses in the economy. This completes the proof.
Imperfect Labor Substitutes With imperfect labor substitutes the Cobb-Douglas
production function used by all Þrms is
α

F i (Ei∗ , Ei , K) = Ei∗ Eiβ K (1−α−β) .
The marginal product of migrant eﬀective labor is just
gEi ∗ (E ∗ , K, w) = FEi ∗ (E ∗ , E(.), K)
F i (Ei∗ , Ei , K)
= α

Also,
gEi ∗ E∗ (.) = FEi ∗ E EEi ∗ + FEi ∗ E ∗

Now
E1∗ = Q1 q1
E2∗ = Q2 q2
where qi is the average migrant worker type hired by Firm i. Then

The right hand side is negative as [ 1−β
