ABSTRACT

Minimum wage legislation is frequently advocated in the belief that it

creates a more nearly equal distribution of income. A one—sector model of
general equilibrium is used to analyze a universally applicable minimum
wage, and a two—sector mQdel is used to analyze a minimum wage that is

only applied to certain industries. In both cases we find that a minimum
wage may well lower equality (as computed by the Gini index) if we consider

reasonable values for the parameters of these two models. In the absence
of unemployment compensation, equality can increase only if the elasticity

of substitution in production is quite low. In the one—sector case, however, equality necessarily rises if unemployment compensation is present
and sufficiently generous.

1

INTRODUCTION

Minimum Wage legislation is frequently advocated in the belief that

it creates a more nearly equal distribution of income. In this paper we
investigate the positive economic question of the conditions under which
this belief is true. We find chat whether it is true depends on whether
the minimum wage is universally applicable, and in the case of a universally
applicable minimum wage, on the level of unemployment compensation.

In general we find that a legal minimum wage will actually reduce
income equality, unless the elasticity of substitution in production between
low—wage labor and other factors of production is fairly low, or unemployment compensation is sufficiently generous.

By investigating this issue, we do not mean to suggest that income

equality is necessarily desirable or equitable. Indeed, Robert Nozick
(1974, chapter 7) has recently demonstrated that distributive justice does

not require any particular state of income or wealth distribution, but

rather a process by which the economy moves from one state to another. In
other words, the proper criterion of justice does not ask how much an

individual has, but rather how he acquired what he has. Greater equality
can therefore actually be inequitable, depending on how the increase in

equality comes about. Nevertheless, the effect of a minimum wage law on
equality is an interesting economic question, to the extent that those who
advocate it regard equality as desirable (Mises 1963, 858).
In this paper, we measure equality with the Gini index, the ratio of
the area under the Lorenz curve to the area under the 45 degree line that

2

represents perfect equality (Gini 1921). This index is, admittedly,

open to objections detailed by Newberry (1970). An alternative class of
indices has been proposed by Atkinson (1970). However, for many values

of Atkinson's parameter e ,

his

index registers perfect inequality if

even one person reports zero income. The Gini index, on the other hand,
is capable of differentiating between different percentages of the population

reporting no income. Since the Gini index is also easily computed and
familiar to economists, we will make do with it.

A ONE-SECTOR MODEL
First, we consider the effects of a universally applicable minimum

wage law, in a one—sector economy. For the sake of simplicity, we will
assume that there are two homogeneous factors, unskilled labor U and skilled

labor S , who between them comprise the entire population, and that output
X is produced competitively by means of a constant returns to scale

production fucntion X = F(U, S). To simplify the analysis, we will ignore

the supply elasticities of U and S , as well as mobility between the two
groups.

We could instead couch our analysis in terms of "Labor" and "Capital."
However, since wages and salaries constitute the great majority of national
income, it seems more relevant to distinguish between different types of

labor that between labor and capital. If the reader is concerned about
non—labor factors, he may consider them within the context of the present

as being owned uniformly by the "skilled laborers."

model

Although in theory our competitive analysis would have to be modified

if

employers are able to exert monopsony power, in practice few labor

3

markets are sufficiently concentrated to permit such power (Bunting 1962,

3—14). Furthermore, even in the presence of monopsony power, a simple
minimum wage is unlikely to do much to produce the efficiency gains and
expanded employment that are possible in theory (Stigler 1946).

Let WU

aLd W be the wage rates paid to unskilled and skilled
S

labor respectively, taking the price of X as numeraire. Let k = IJW/X
1—k =

and

SW

S /X be the relative shares of U and S in national income. We

measure U and S as fractions of the total population, so that U + S = 1
initially, when there is full employment.

The Lorenz curve in the absence of a minimum wage law is shown in
Figure 1.1 In this diagram, the entire population is arranged along the
horizontal axis from the lowest income individuals (the unskilled laborers)

to the highest income individuals (the skilled laborers). The vertical
axis measures percent of total income earned by individuals to the left of

any given value on the horizontal axis. Our initial Lorenz curve follows a
straight line from the point (0, 0) to (U, k), and then another straight
line to (1, 1).

Suppose now that a universally applicable and completely effective
minimum wage law is passed, preventing laborers from working (or what
amounts to the same thing, preventing employers from hiring them) if they

cannot cotand a certain minimum wage somewhat higher than the market

This law will throw unskilled workers out

of work until the marginal product of those remaining equals the minimum

wage. To the extent that workers embody human capital that is specific

cause transitory income to be less equally distributed than the more
relevant concept of total human wealth (discounted lifetime earnings).

to the firm they work for (such as hiring costs or specific training),

the unemployment effect will be lessened in the short run. (See Oi 1962.)
However, in the long run

the

full unemployment will appear. In any case,

unskilled workers probably embody relatively little human capital, specific
or otherwise, so that there will be substantial unemployment even in the

short run. Thus, Brozen (1969) and Kosters and Welch (1972) find appreciable
short—run unemployment effects among teen—agers, and especially among
non—white teen—agers. We therefore believe our simple model captures a large
part of the truth.

In the absence of unemployment compensation, the unemployed make nothing,

so they are now at the very bottom of the income distribution, even below

the employed unskilled. The total share of unskilled, unemployed and employed

together, is now k + dk.

It is well known (and will be demonstrated below

in passing) that dk will be negative if the elasticity of substitution
(Hicks 1957, 245) between the two factors is greater than unity, and

positive if it is less than unity. In the former case, illustrated in Figure
2, the new Lorenz curve will, be entirely below the original curve, so that

equality surely must decline by any measure. In the latter case, however,
the new Lorenz curve starts off below the original curve and then passes
above it, as shown in Figure 3.

It is not at once obvious whether equality

has risen or fallen in this case.

In order to solve this problem we must explicitly compute the Cmi
index. Its initial value is

C =

[-kiJ
= kU + (k+1)S

=k+S .

6

Keeping in mind that dU is negative, the value of the Gini index as
modified by the minimum wage law is

G+dG= [(k+dk)(u+du) +(k+dk+l)S]/
= kU + kdU + Udk + dkdU + kS + Sdk + S
=

G

+ dk + kdTJ + dkdU

The term dkdU is of only the second order of smalls, so we may ignore it if
dW is sufficiently small:

dG=dk+kdU .

2)

The demand curve for U will be the schedule of the marginal product

of U given the quantity of S available, that is, F(U, S). When W
goes up by dWu , U

falls by dU (see Figure 4). The slope of this curve

is F, the second partial derivative of F with respect to U, so we have

laufman and Foran (1968/71, 189—218) erroneously investigate the
share of the affected factor in order to determine whether or not the
legislation has increased equality. We have shown that if (1—k)/(1+U—k) <
a < 1, equality will fall even though the share of the directly affected
factor rises.
Zucker (1973) finds estimates of the demand elasticity for low—wage
labor between —0.79 and —1.15. By (3), the elasticity of substitution
therefore would lie between .79(1—k) and 1.15(1—k), which is probably below
unity, in spite of the apparent robustness of the Cobb—Douglas formulation.

we may state that a

minimum wage law will raise equality only if it raises the absolute share of

share of U
It might be objected to the analysis of this section that the unemployment

will rotate among the directly affected group of workers, so that there will

not, in the long run, be an identifiable class of unemployed. In this case, it

would only be necessary for a to be less than 1 (a much more likely event

than a < (1 —

k]/[l + U

—

k])

for equality to increase. However, this

objection confuses frictional unemployment with minimum wage unemployment. As
a rule, we would expect.unemployment caused by ordinary job turnover to pass
from worker to worker, while that caused by minimum wage legislation would not.

If there is even the slightest difference in the efficiency of different
unskilled workers, the burden of minimum wage unemployment will fall entirely

on the shoulders of the least efficient. Thus the resulting unemployment will
persistently afflict the already otherwise disadvantaged: the unschooled, the
inexperienced, teenagers, and those who have not mastered the majority language.

10

Even if efficiency is uniformly distributed, the available jobs are likely
to be rationed by employers on the basis of non—efficiency considerations
that would ordinarily be overridden by market forces, such as race, religion,
sex, ethnic origin, political affiliation, or kinship.
We therefore must conclude that although it is not impossible for a
universally applicable minimum wage to increase the equality of income dis-

tribution in the absence of unemployment compensation, it is not very likely
to do so. In the event that it does actually raise equality, it is only
because the improved position of employed unskilled labor relative to skilled
labor outweighs the necessarily deteriorated position of unemployed unskilled

relative to employed unskilled. In any event there is always increased
inequality at the lower end of the income distribution.

11

THE ONE—SECTOR MODEL WITH UNPLOYMENT COMPENSATION

In the presence of unemployment compensation, the effect on equality
of a universally applicable minimum wage law will be somewhat different.

Suppose that the unemployed are compensated at the fraction a of the wage they

would obtain if they were employed, so that they receive aW .

(Whether they

will not affect the results

is infinitessimal.) Although such compensation can

act as a strong subsidy to unemployment (Feldstein 1974), we will ignore these

supply effects, and assume that observed employment is affected only by the demand

effect of a minimum wage, provided a is less than unity.
We will assume that the compensation is paid for out of a proportional

income tax. While such a tax is likely not to be proportional in practice,
we make this assumption in order to investigate the distributional effects of
the minimum wage with unemployment compensation in isolation from the effect
of redistributive tax structures.

The unemployed receive _aWdU, and output becomes X+dX (where both dU
and dX are negative), so the income of the employed unskilled and skilled
workers must be taxed at the following rate in order to finance the corn—
pensation:

-aW dU
U

X+dX

Ignoring

terms in the second order of smalls, this rate becomes

12

t = —akEU

With unemployment compensation, the Lorenz curve in the presence of
a minimum wage law will pass from (0, 0) to (—dU, —akEU) to (U, k+dk) to

(1, 1), where we interpret k+dk as the modified share of all unskilled

workers, including the unemployed. The new Gini index is now

G + dG =

[akETJdU

+ (U +dU) (-akEU + k + dk)

++(1+k+dk)S1/4
Ignoring terms in the second order of sinalls and rearranging, we have

dG

(l—a)kUEU + dk

The modified after—tax share of unskilled workers is now

k + dk =

-aW dU + (U+dU) (W +dW ) (1+akEU)

Again ignoring terms in the second order of smalls and rearranging, we have

This expression is positive if and only if

(l—a)(1+U—k)

If a is between zero and unity, we see that if a is small enough to
increase equality without compensation, it is necessarily small enough to
increase equality with compensation.

We also see that the more generous unemployment compensation is, the more
likely a minimum

wage is to increase equality. In particular, as the fraction a

approaches unity, a universally applicable minimum wage becomes certain to
increase equality.

It does not follow, however, that generous unemployment compensation

necessarily increases the income of unskilled workers. Their total after

tax income N+dN is the numerator of the right—hand side of (8). Once
more expanding and ignoring terms in the second order of smalls, we have

dN =

Unskilled labor income therefore rises if and only if

or equivalently,

a (1—k)

Since a is bounded by zero and unity, we see that if a is less than 1—k,

14

unskilled income necessarily rises, even if a equals zero. On the other
hand, if a is greater than (l—k)/k, unskilled income necessarily falls,

regardless of a.

15

A TWO—SECTOR MODEL

Most minimum wage legislation is not universally applicable as we have

assuaed above. Although less qualified workers are effectively barred from
certain occupations, other occupations may remain open to them. Usually these
uncovered jobs are in fields such as agriculture, domestic service, small—

scale industry, and self employment. If the displaced workers prefer low—pay
jobs in these fields to unemployment, the effects of the minimum wage law will

be modified.2 In this section, we will ignore the possibility of unemployment compensation, in effect assuming that unemployment compensation is
unattractive in comparison to employment in the low—wage uncovered sector.

Let us assume that there are two sectors, producing outputs X and Y
competitively. Let m be the share of the X—industry in national income and

let f and g be the shares of unskilled labor in the income of the X and
Y sectors respectively. Let U , U

Initially, W = WY = W < 1

2See Brozen (1962) for an analysis of the stimulating effect minimum
wage rises have on the pool of domestic workers. Dropping out of the labor
force altogether to perform non—market household duties or leisure activities
may also be interpreted as entering an uncovered industry. Thus, Moore (1971)
finds that the increase in the minimum wage in .1961 seems to have lowered
the subsequent labor force participation of teenagers. We assume job turnover
in the covered sector to be low enough that speculative unemployment of the
type Mincer (1976) dIscusses does not appear.
3Th1s model is essentially that employed by Jones (1965), Johnson (1969) and
Johnson and Mieszkowskj (1970). See McCufloch (1974) and the comments below,
however, for qualifying considerations in a special case.

Figure 5 shows the initial distribution of income, before the minimum

wage is applied. In Figure 6, a minimum wage has been applied to the X sector,
raising the real wage in that industry, both absolutely and relative to the

wage in Y .

Instead

of unemployment appearing, we assume now that unskilled

laborers are perfectly mobile so that those displaced by the minimum wage

immediately find work in the uncovered Y sector.

and the covered X industry is labor—

intensive, this system is invalid, since a minimum wage in the X industry,

even when dW

employment and output variables, rather than the irifinitessitnal changes

assumed by the equations. This problem arises when

18)

20

which according to system (15) is the value of (EW —EP)/(EW —EW), is
negative.5

When expression (18) is negative, a minimum wage in the X

industry will cause a discrete reduction in X output and employment and

may

even close down the X industry. We have made no

assumptions about how

the economy behaves outside a small neighborhood of the initial equilibrium,
so we cannot say for certain what will happen to equality in this case.

However, it seems likely that it will decline.
Expression (17) can have either sign, depending on the values of the

underlying parameters. The term in

or

is always negative, so that if in

is large enough, equality will surely fall. Since it is the only one

of the three terms that is determinate in sign, equality tends, if anything,
to fall in the two sector model, though this is at best a weak presumption.

In order to obtain a better feel for the likely effect of a minimum wage
in this model, we assign prior probability distributions to the values of the
basic parameters and compute a derived prior probability that the minimum

wage will reduce equality. To be sure, the derived prior will depend
critically on the assumed parameter priors. Nevertheless, this is a convenient
way to summarize our knowledge of a complex expression, one which could perhaps,
with experience, be applied to other problems as well.

The parameters f, g, m, and W may take on values between 0 and 1, so we
will consider the five values .1, .3, .5, .7, and .9 for these four parameters.

5mis expression is the same as the right hand side of equation (14) on
p. 447 of Jones (1971), in the case of an infinitessimal distortion.
Jones, however, does not recognize the inapplicability of the differential
model when this expression is negative.

21

The substitution elasticities a , a
c

o

to

x,

and a

y

may take on values from

infinity. Estimates of substitution elasticities often cluster about

unity, so we will want to center our substition elasticity distributions

around 1. The range .5 to 2 probably includes most reasonable estimates of
the a's, but since (17) is sensitive to extreme values of these three
parameters, we will also include .1 and 10. Thus we consider the five
values .1, .5, 1, 2, and 10 for each of the three substitution elasticities. In

order

not to give too much weight to the extreme values of the seven basic

parameters,6 we assign

prior probabilities of .1, .2, .4, .2, and .1 to the

five values of each parameter, respectively. Assuming independence between the

prior distributions of our parameters we can then easily compute the prior
probability of each of the 57 = 78,275 combinations of values. Expression
(17) was evaluated for each of these combinations, resulting in a derived

prior probability of .799 that equality will fall. (When expression (18) proved
negative, it was assumed that equality would fall regardless of the value of
(17). However, this perverse case only occurred with prior probability .015,
so its treatment did not have a major effect on the results.)

In order to test the sensitivity of the change in the Cmi index to the
extreme values of .1 and .9 that we allowed for f, g, in, and W and of .1 and

10 that we allowed for a , a , and a , we also tried assigning the prior dis—

case expression (18) was never negative, and the derived prior probability
of equality falling rose to .906.

The effect on income equality of a minimum wage law that is not
universally applicable depends on the technological characteristics, importance,

and factor intensities of the covered and uncovered sectors. This will vary
with the provisions of the particular legislation under consideration. However,
we may conclude that it would take a fairly unusual combination of parameters
to prevent such a minimum wage from reducing income equality.
