    "abstract": "\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to test for evidence of opportunistic \"political business cycles\" in a large sample of 18 OECD economies. Our results can be summarized as follows: 1) We find very little evidence of pre-electoral effects of economic outcomes, in particular, on GDP growth and unemployment; 2) We see some evidence of \"political monetary cycles.\" that is, expansionary monetary policy in election years; 3) We also observe indications of \"political budget cycles,\" or \"loose\" fiscal policy prior to elections; 4) Inflation exhibits a postelectoral jump, which could be explained by either the preelectoral \"loose\" monetary and fiscal policies and/or by an opportunistic timing of increases in publicly controlled prices, or indirect taxes.\n\n",
