I. Introduction
A number of proposals for reforming the “international financial architecture”
have recently been advanced by academics, policy makers, and pundits of various types.
These reform blueprints have included the imposition of controls on capital inflows,
abolishing the IMF, and the creation of a global lender of last resort. But perhaps the
most intriguing reform proposal is that emerging countries should completely give up
their currencies, and adopt an advanced nation’s currency as legal tender.
This proposal has come to be known as “dollarization,” and is being pushed with
increased vigor by a small, but increasingly influential, group of economists.1 What
started as an intellectual, but mostly impractical idea, has recently become a real policy
option. During the last few months some countries have either dollarized, or have
announced that they are moving in that direction. In 2000, and in the midst of a major
crisis, Ecuador abolished its national currency, the Sucre, and adopted the U.S. dollar as
legal tender. El Salvador has recently announced that it plans to adopt the dollar during
2001, and Guatemala and Nicaragua are considering the option seriously.
At a general level, dollarization is being presented as the ultimate way for
achieving credibility, growth, and prosperity. Countries that give up their currencies, we
are told, will be unable to engage in macroeconomic mismanagement. Thus, public
finances will stay in balance, and the external accounts will move within reasonable
bounds. Dollarization-imposed macroeconomic stability, the story goes, will mean lower
interest rates, higher investment, and superior economic performance. Current arguments
in favor of dollartization have gone beyond traditional discussions on optimal currency
areas. Indeed, dollarization proponents have recently argued that giving up the national
currency is the right option for the vast majority – if not for all -- of the emerging nations.
What is remarkable, however, is that this rather drastic piece of advice – giving up
the national currency – is being dispensed on the bases of very limited empirical and
historical evidence. Dollarization supporters seldom expand on the historical record of
those few countries that have been dollarized for some time. Moreover, they rarely spellout the policies that should be implemented alongside this reform, nor do they refer in

Some times this policy is called “official dollarization” as a way of distinguishing it from currency
substitution or “unofficial dolllarization.” See Savastano (1992).

detail to the potential costs of adopting this monetary regime. This is equivalent to a
physician prescribing a drug, without making clear what other steps the patient must take
(stay in bed, abstain from drinking alcohol, say), and without explaining the drug’s side
effects, or its rate of success in clinical trials.2
The purpose of this paper is to remedy, at least partially, this situation, and to
investigate the historical record of countries that have lived under a “dollarized”
monetary system. As it turns out, this is a very small group of counties, most of which
have operated under very special circumstances, and for which there are very limited
data. In spite of the poverty of the data, I believe that it is possible to address some
important historical questions regarding performance under dollarization. These include:
(a) Historically, has dollarization provided an effective way for tying policy makers’
hands, and for achieving “credibility.” Another way of posing this question, is whether
dollarized nations have indeed enjoyed fiscal and external balance. (b) Have dollarized
countries experienced faster growth and lower inflation than non-dollarized ones. And,
(c) how costly has macroeconomic adjustment been in dollarized countries. In standard
macroeconomic models, economies with super-fixed exchange rate regimes and nominal
price rigidities will have difficulties accommodating (real) external shocks.
Since Panama is the dollarized country with better and more complete data, much
of this paper deals with the Panamanian economy. When the data permit it, however, I
deal with the experiences of other dollarized nations. The paper is organized as follows.
Section I is the introduction. In Section II I present some basic data on economic
performance in dollarized nations, and I ask whether there have been significant
differences in the behavior of dollarized and non-dollarized economies. In Section III I
concentrate on the case of Panama, the largest country with a prolonged dollarization
experience. Section IV is devoted to analyzing the way in which dollarized countries
have been affected by external shocks. In particular, I inquire whether external shocks

2

Recent papers by Moreno-Villalaz (1999) and Bogetic (2000) discuss some important characteristics of
dollarized economies. For a lucid conceptual treatment of dollarization see Calvo (1999). See also the
useful piece by Schuller (2000). For a debate on the merits of dollarization, see Edwards and Haussman
(2001). Ricardo Haussman, the former Chief Economist of the Interamerican Development Bank, has been
a vocal supporter of dollarization. Interestingly, and in contrast with the case of dollarization, there are
now a number of studies on currency boards. See, for example, Baliño et al (1997), Schuler (1992) and
Gosh et al (2000).

3

have tended to affect dollarized countries in a different way than other nations. Finally,
in Section IV I provide some brief concluding remarks.
II. Dollarization Experiences in Comparative Perspective
It should be stated at the outset that my interest – and the relevant policy question,
I may add – is to understand how independent nations have performed under a dollarized
monetary system. This means that in this paper I am not interested in analyzing the
performances of provinces or states within a national entity. The reason for this should
be obvious: countries contemplating dollarization are independent nations looking for an
efficient monetary arrangement; they are not countries looking to be annexed by larger
and more advanced ones.3 Table 1 contains a list of independent countries that have had
an official dollarized system during the 1970-1998 period.4 As maybe seen, these are
very small countries indeed. Many are, in fact, city-states fully integrated into their
neighbors’ economies – Monaco, Lichtestein and Andorra are good examples. The
largest dollarized countries in Table 1 are Liberia and Panama. Only the latter, however,
remains dollarized today; Liberia abandoned the system in the 1980s, when the
government of President Samuel Doe decided to issue local currency as a way of
avoiding the constraints imposed on the public sector by the dollarized system.5
Analyzing performance in small city-states has traditionally represented a
challenge for economists. Data are usually not available, and when they are, they are of
poor quality and cover selected variables only. In our case the problem is particularly
serious, since data for Liberia -- one of only two countries with population over a million
--, are of extremely low quality. Panama is the only dollarized country with a reasonably
complete data set.
In this study I focus on the 1970-1998 period, and I use the best data available for
as many of the countries in Table 1, as possible. In collecting the data I first turned to the
3

The focus on independent nations raises the question of whether we should concentrate on the period
since independence, or on the complete period under analysis. The results reported in this paper refer to
countries that have been independent for at least 5 years. If, however, different criteria are used, the results
obtained are very similar to those reported here.
4
By dollarized countries, I mean countries that use another nation’s currency. I have excluded countries
that use a common supra-national currency, such as the Euro.
5
It is not easy to date unequivocally Liberia’s abandonment of the dollarized system. In July 1974 the
National Bank of Liberia (NBL) was opened. In 1982 the NBL began issuing five dollar coins, and in 1989
it began issuing five dollar notes. On Liberia’s dollarization experience see Barret (1995) and Berkeley
(1993).

4

World Bank data files. If the World Bank had no information – or if the data quality was
deemed to be suspect --, I turned to the IMF and the United Nations. Overall, I was able
to collect data on GDP per capita growth for 11 countries in Table 1 (a total of 286
country-year data points). Data on other variables of interest – inflation, fiscal deficit, the
current account, investment and terms of trade --, are only available for a much smaller
number of countries.6 In the rest of this section I analyze the economic performance of
the dollarized economies in Table 1. In order to provide a comparative perspective I also
present data on two comparison groups: (1) A group of all emerging and advanced
countries for which there are data. And (2), a group of all emerging countries where data
are available. I excluded from both of these groups countries that have had a “superfixed” exchange rate regime – dollarized or currency board. This means that my
comparison groups are comprised of countries with a variety of exchange rate regimes,
going from floating, to crawling, to pegged-but-adjustable. That is, I do not perform a
“horse race” between dollarized countries and specific alternative regimes.
Table 2 contains summary data on, (a) GDP per capita growth; (b) inflation; (c)
fiscal deficit; and (d) current account deficit. For each variable I present information on
the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the mean. For GDP per capita growth
I also present data on the standard deviation. Simple inspection of the data suggests that,
when compared with either of the two non-dollarized groups, dollarized countries have
had: (a) lower GDP per capita growth; (b) lower inflation; (c) similar, or slightly higher
fiscal deficits; and (d) a higher median and lower mean current account deficit. Also,
GDP growth has been more volatile in dollarized countries.7
In order to test formally whether these four variables have behaved differently
across groups of countries, I estimated a series of tests for the equality of means and
medians. I also computed a non parametric Kruskal-Wallis χ 2 tests on the equality of
distributions. The Kruskal-Wallis χ 2 test is computed as:

(1)
6

K = { [ 12/ n( n + 1) ] Σ ( Rj 2 / n j ) } – 3( n + 1),

See Edwards (2001a) for a detailed discussion of the data available and of data sources.

5

where n j is the sample size for the j group (j = 1,…m), n is the sum of the n js, Rj is the
sum of the ranks j group, and the sum Σ runs from j=1 to j=m.
The results obtained from these tests are reported in Tables 3 and 4. They show
formally that: (1) GDP growth has been significantly lower in the dollarized countries
than in non dollarized ones. (2) Inflation has been statistically lower under dollarization.
(3) There are no statistical differences in the behavior of fiscal deficits or current account
balances across dollarized and non dollarized nations. These results also show that
inflation has been significantly lower in Panama. There are no significant differences
between growth behavior in Panama and the other groups. Interestingly, the median
fiscal deficit has been statistically higher in Panama than in the rest of the Latin
American nations. I discuss this puzzling result in Section III.
The GDP growth comparisons in Table 2 refer to unconditional statistics. An
interesting question is whether dollarized countries perform differently than non
dollarized ones, after controlling by the fundamental determinants of growth. Results
obtained from a panel regression using a (very) small number of data points for the
dollarized economies, suggest the conditional rate of growth of per capita GDP is lower
for dollarized than non-dollarized nations.8 In these regressions – not reported here – the
coefficient of the dollarized dummy is negative; its p-values, however, was rather high
ranging from 0.16 and 0.11.
The results reported in this section, then, can be summarized as follows: (1)
There is evidence that dollarized countries as a group have statistically grown at a
significantly lower rate than non-dollarized nations. (2) Dollarized countries have
experienced a significantly lower rate of inflation. (3) There is no evidence that
dollarized countries have run more prudent fiscal policies than non-dollarized nations. In
fact, the formal tests show that, statistically speaking, it is not possible to make a
distinction between dollarized and non-dollarized countries. And (4), in terms of current
account balances, dollarized nations’ behavior has been no different than that of non7

There are 4,272 observations for GDP growth in all non-super-fixed countries; 3,378 observations for
emerging countries; 750 for Latin American countries and 286 observations for dollarized countries. See
Edwards (2001a) for more details on the data set.
8
The lack of data makes this exercise difficult, however: While there are 286 observations for growth in
dollarized countries, there are only 56 for investment, 58 for openness, and 58 for government expenditure.
In the estimation I used random effects and GLS methods.

6

dollarized ones. Given the very small number of observations for the dollarized group,
and the low quality of the data, these results are subject to stronger caveats than usual,
and should be interpreted with care.9
III. Panama’s Experience with Dollarization
Supporters of “dollarization” have pointed out to Panama’s experience as proof of
the merits of that system. Low inflation, macroeconomic stability, and low interest rates –
including the existence of long term credit in nominal terms – are mentioned as some of
Panama’s most remarkable accomplishments (Moreno-Villalaz 1999, Bogetic 2000). In
this section I provide a brief analysis of Panama’s experience, and I argue that, in spite of
some very important achievements, its record has been embellished.
A fundamental omission in virtually every recent account of Panama’s economic
experience refers to the country’s heavy reliance on the IMF during the last 35 years or
so. With the exception of a brief interregnum during the Noriega years, Panama has been
almost permanently under the tutelage of the Fund. Since 1973 Panama has had 17 IMF
Programs, the most recent of which was signed in late 2000, and is expected to run until
late 2002. According to Mussa and Savastano (2000), during the last quarter of a century
Panama has been the most assiduous user of IMF resources in the Western Hemisphere;
since 1973, only Pakistan has had a larger number of IMF programs. The main factor
behind this proliferation of IMF programs has been Panama’s inability, until very
recently, to control its public finances. Between 1973 and 1998 the fiscal deficit
averaged 4% of GDP, and during 1973-1987 – a period of continuous IMF programs – it
exceeded a remarkable 7% of GDP. In fact, it has only been in the last few years that
Panama has been able to put its fiscal accounts somewhat in order.10
In 1904 Panama adopted the dollar as legal tender. Although there is a national
currency – the Balboa --, its role is largely symbolic. There is no central bank and the
monetary authorities cannot issue Balboa-denominate notes. Since 1970 Panama has had
no controls on capital mobility, and has been financially integrated to the rest of the
world. For decades Panama has been an important center for offshore banking, with a
9

The power of our non parametric tests is reduced when the number of observations in the two groups are
very different.
10
During some years Panama did not make actual withdrawals from the IMF funds. However, even during
those years, the IMF had a fundamental role in overseeing the Panamanian economy.

7

large number of international banks operating in the country. A number of authors have
argued that in Panama foreign banks play the role of “lender of last resort,” a function
usually performed by the national central bank. It should be noted, however, that in spite
of dollarization and of the massive presence of international banks, Panama has been
recently subject, as many other countries in Latin America, to massive banking crises.
Indeed, in 1988-89 Panama suffered a major systemic banking crisis, where as a result of
the weak “financial position of most state-owned and private commercial banks…15
banks ceased operations.” (Beim and Calomiris 2001, p. 282). 11
As may be seen from Table 2, Panama’s most remarkable achievement is its very
low rate of inflation. Between 1955 and 1998, it averaged 2.4% per annum, and during
the 1990s it barely exceeded 1 percent per year. In addition to low inflation, Panama has
posted a healthy rate of growth during the last four decades. Between 1958 and 1998,
Panama’s real GDP expanded at 5.3 percent per year. Although Panama’s rate of growth
has exceeded that of other dollarized economies, it has not been statistically different
from that of non-dollarized conuntries. This is true independently of whether the nondollarized comparison group is comprised of all nations, emerging countries, or only of
Latin American countries (see the non parametric tests in Table 3).
Behind these achievements, however, hides Panama’s serious addiction for IMF
programs. In spite of not having a central bank, or a currency of its own, for years
Panama failed to maintain fiscal discipline. Initially, these large fiscal deficits were
financed through borrowing from abroad. And when the foreign debt became too high,
the IMF stepped in with fresh resources. And when this was not enough, Panama
restructured its foreign debt. This was the case in 1983, 1985 and more recently in 1996,
when Panama finalized its Brady-deal negotiations.12 Panama had its first IMF program
in 1965. A year later the fiscal deficit was brought into check. In 1968, however, the
fiscal accounts were again out of hand, and the IMF was called in once more. A
remarkable nineteen-year period of uninterrupted IMF programs was thus initiated.
Although in some of the early programs there were no withdrawals, the sheer presence of
the IMF signaled that the monies would indeed be there when needed.
11

Bogetic (2000), in an interesting article, incorrectly states that in Panama “there have been no systematic
banking crises (p. 192)”
12
According to Beim and Calomiris (2001) Panama also restructured its debt in 1932.

8

Year after year, a new IMF program called for the strengthening of public
finances. And, invariably, year after year, Panama failed to take serious action. After all,
the authorities knew that the IMF was there, ready to bail them out. This continuous IMF
presence was only broken in 1987, when as a result of General Noriega’s confrontational
policies, Panama was subject to severe U.S.-led economic sanctions. The IMF returned
to Panama in September of 1990, with a monitored program. This was followed by
lending programs in 1992 (22 months), 1995 (16 months), 1997 (36 months) and 2000
(22 months). Significantly, in the last few years the authorities have finally
acknowledged the need for maintaining a solid fiscal position. Between 1990 and 1996
the country posted small public sector surpluses. By 1998, however, the public sector
deficit had grown to almost 3% of GDP, and the IMF has estimated that during 2000 the
deficit had declined to a more modest 1% of GDP. Why has the IMF been so willing to
accommodate Panama’s repeated macroeconomic transgressions? A full analysis to this
issue is well beyond the scope of this paper, but political economy considerations –
including the U.S. interest in maintaining the Canal Zone free of political turmoil --, are
surely part of the answer.
In contrast with Argentina, a country with a super-fixed currency-board type of
monetary regime, Panama has been largely successful in eliminating devaluation risk.
This has been reflected in a relatively low cost of capital in international financial
markets. Between 1997 and 1998, for example, the average daily spread on Panamanian
par bonds was 464 basis points, lower than that of Argentine par Brady bonds, which
averaged 710 basis points. Contrary to what dollarization supporters usually claim,
however, Panama’s cost of capital in international markets has not been the lowest in
Latin America. In fact, as is illustrated in Figure 1, the spread over Panamanian bonds
has been systematically and significantly higher than that over Chile’s sovereign bonds of
similar maturity.13 Interestingly, Chile is a country that during the period under
discussion experienced an overall increase in its degree of exchange rate flexibility. The
comparison between Chile and Panama underscores the important point – not always
13

Bogetic (2000, p. 193) has claimed that “Panama’s sovereign spreads have been consistently lower than
in other Latin American countries.” As figure 1 shows, this is not so. The spreads in Figure 1 correspond
to daily data for Panama’s 8 ½ % sovereign bond due in 2008, and Chile’s 6 7/8 % sovereign bond due in
2009.

9

acknowledged – that dollarization does not by itself reduce country risk. In fact, during
the last few years, and in spite of its improved fiscal performance, Panama has
experienced a sizable country risk premium and has been subject to “contagion.”
Recent discussions on dollarization have focused on the loss of seignorage that
would result from unilaterally adopting a foreign currency. Supporters of dollarization
have argued that this loss could be reduced if a monetary treatise is signed with the
advanced country whose currency is adopted. This is not a new idea. In fact, it was
proposed in 1972 by Harry Johnson within the context of the Panamanian experience.14
IV.

Accommodating External Disturbances under Dollarization
Macroeconomic models of open economies have traditionally emphasized the role

of the exchange rate regime during the adjustment process. In principle, under superfixed regimes a required depreciation of the equilibrium real exchange rate will have to
take place through deflation. In the presence of nominal price and wage rigidities, this
will lead to unemployment and slower growth (Dornbusch 1980). The actual quantitative
importance of these deflationary forces is an empirical issue. In this section I use data
from the dollarized nations to address this issue. In particular I ask the following two
questions: First, what has been the effect of terms of trade shocks on dollarized nations’
performance? More specifically, I ask whether these shocks affect dollarized countries
differently than other (non-dollarized) countries. Second, I investigate whether
macroeconomic adjustment episodes – and in particular major current account reversals –
have been more costly in dollarized than in non-dollarized nations. Originally I intended
to use data from a large number of dollarized countries; unfortunately, only Panama has
data for all the variables of interest.
IV.1 Current Account Reversals and Terms of Trade Shocks
Table 4 contains data on terms of trade volatility, and on current account reversals
for Panama and three comparison groups during 1970-98. Terms of trade volatility is
defined as the standard deviation of the log of the relative price of exports to imports. I
have defined a “current account reversal” as a situation where the current account deficit

14

In 1999-2000 a bill that would have allowed for the sharing of seignorage was introduced to the US
Senate. Without support by Congress or the administration, however , the bill did not go anywhere.

10

has declined by at least three percent of GDP in one year.15 The data in this table show
that the frequency of current account reversals has been similar in Panama, in all the
emerging markets in the sample, and in the (rest of the) Latin American nations. The
mean current account reversal has also been similar in Panama and the other Latin
American nations – 7.7% of GDP in Panama, and 8.1% of GDP in LAC. Finally, terms of
trade volatility has been somewhat lower in Panama than in the comparison groups.
IV.2 Adjustment and Growth: Panama’s Experience in a Comparative Perspective
In this sub-section I use panel data for 1970-1998 to investigate whether terms of
trade shocks and current account reversals have been more “costly” in Panama than in
other (non dollarized) countries. The starting point is a the following growth equation:

(2)

GROWTH t j = β INVGDP t

j

+ ϕ EDU t j + δ GOVCONS t j

+ φ OPENNESS t j + θ LOGGDPO j + γ REVERSAL t j
+ λ LOGTOT t j + ξ t j.

Where GROWTH t j is growth of GDP per capita in country j during year t; INVGDP is
the investment to GDP ratio, EDU is a proxy for human capital, measured as secondary
education attainement. GOVCONS is the ratio of government consumption to GDP, and
OPENNESS is an index of the degree of openness (imports plus exports over GDP).
REVERSAL is a variable that takes the value of one if the country in question has been
subject to a current account reversal. LOGTOT is the log of the terms of trade. Finally,
LOGGDPO j is the initial level of GDP (1970) for country j. The main interest of this
analysis is the coefficients of REVERSAL and LOGTOT. The coefficient of the former
will be negative if reversals are costly, the coefficient of LOGTOT is expected to be
positive. In order to analyze whether these coefficients are different for Panama, I also
interacted LOGTOT and REVERSAL with a Panama dummy. The error ξ t j is assumed
to be heteroscedastic, with a different variance for each of the k countries (panels).

15

When I used alternative definitions the results were similar to those reported here. On current account
reversals see Milesi-Ferreti and Razin (2000).

Equation (2) was estimated using the feasible generalized least squares procedure (FGLS)
suggested by Beck and Katz (1995) for unbalanced panels. The samples in the different
estimations were determined by data availability. For details, see Edwards (2001a).
Since current account reversals are not drawn from a random experiment, the
REVERSAL j t dummy is possibly correlated with the error term. In order to deal with
this problem I follow the procedure recently suggested by Heckman et al (1997) for
estimating “treatment interventions” models. This procedure consists of estimating the
equation in question using observations that have a common support for both the
“treated” and the “non-treaded” samples. In the case at hand, countries that experience a
reversal are considered to be subject to the “treatment intervention.”16
In Table 5 I present the results obtained from the estimation of various versions of
equation (2), after making the correction suggested by Heckman et al (1997). Estimates
are presented for the complete panel, for the emerging countries only, and for the Latin
American and Caribbean nations. The results for the complete panel (including Panama),
reported in column 1, are highly satisfactory. All the coefficients have the expected signs
and are significant at conventional levels. These results suggest that current account
reversals are costly, and de-accelerate the rate of growth in the country in question.17 The
coefficient of LOGTOT indicates that negative (positive) terms of trade shocks have a
negative (positive) effect on growth. The results obtained when Panama interactive
dummies are introduced are in columns (2)-(4). The coefficients for the Panama
variables are always significant at conventional levels. According to the χ 2 tests the
16

From a practical point of view, a two steps procedure is used: (1) The conditional probability of
countries facing a reversal – the propensity score -- is first estimated using a probit regression. Equation
(2) is estimated using only observations whose estimated probability of reversal fall within the interval of
estimated probabilities for countries with actual reversals.
17

When the first differences of LOGTOT is introduced instead of the levels, the results are qualitatively
similar.

12

hypothesis that the Panama coefficients are jointly zero is rejected. More important,
Panama’s terms of trade coefficient is significantly positive, and Panama’s current
account reversals coefficient is significantly negative. These results indicate that external
shocks in the form of terms of trade disturbances and current account reversals have had
larger (negative) effects on Panama than in non-dollarized countries. This result holds
independently of the group of non-dollarized nations used as a comparison.18
In an effort to understand better the results reported in table 5, I used the
estimation from the complete panel (including Panama) reported in Column 1, to
compute Panama’s residuals. I then analyzed the value of these residuals during the
years when Panama experienced current account reversals and large negative terms of
trade disturbances. By pursuing this strategy I was particularly interested in analyzing
whether the results in Table 5 were driven by the Noriega-crisis years (1988-90). This
exercise shows that the finding that external shocks have been particularly costly in
Panama are not driven by the Noriega crisis years.
The results in Table 5 have been obtained assuming that the other variables in
equation (2) remain constant. In reality, however, other things do change. In particular,
terms of trade shocks and current account reversals are likely to result in a decline in
investment.19 In Edwards (2001a) I use a dynamic panel to estimate investment
equations, and I find that this is indeed the case. Moreover, according to these results,
terms of trade shocks and current account reversals have had a greater (negative) effect
on Panama’s investment ratios than on non-dollarized countries’ investment. Overall,
then, the results in Table 5, as well as those on investment ratios, indicate that during the
period under consideration external shocks have generated higher costs – in the form of
lower investment and slower GDP growth – in dollarized Panama than in the non
dollarized nations.
V.

Concluding Remarks
The purpose of this paper has been to analyze the economic record of dollarized

countries. In doing this I have made an effort to give dollarization the benefit of the
18

The results in Table 5 were obtained using a dummy variable for current account reversal. I also
estimated the growth equations replacing REVERSAL with the reversals dummy interacted with the actual
magnitude of the reversal. These results confirm those presented in Table 5.

doubt; when judgenment calls had to be made, I deliberately tried to “favor” the
dollarization position. For instance, I did not use the IMF’s data on Liberia’s GDP, I
report extensive results for Panama – the best performing dollarizer --, and in many
Panama calculations I excluded the Noriega crisis years. It should be emphasized once
again, however, that because of serious data limitation, this study’s conclusions should be
interpreted with care. In some cases they are based on data for one or two countries only.
My main conclusion from this analysis is that the recent push for dollarization is a
typical case of misleading advertisement. Most dollarization supporters have either
ignored the record, or have embellished it. The reality is that the historical record is very
limited, and concentrated on tiny countries. The largest one (Panama) has a population of
less than 3 million people! As I wrote in the introduction, advocating dollarization is like
recommending a new drug that has been subject to very limited clinical trials. Worse yet,
the results of these trials are not particularly positive or encouraging, and they generate a
number of serious questions. In terms of this medical analogy, a physician may still
prescribe the untried drug to a terminally ill patient, but would not prescribe it to a rather
healthy individual who has access to other treatment options.
In a nutshell, the analysis reported in this paper suggests that, when compared to
other countries, the dollarized nations have: (a) grown at a significantly lower rate; (b)
have had a similar fiscal record; (c) have not been spared from major current account
reversals; (d) have had significantly lower inflation. Additionally, my analysis of
Panama’s case suggests that external shocks result in greater costs – in terms of lower
investment and growth -- in dollarized than in non-dollarized countries. 20
A particularly puzzling result is that dollarizers have not had a better fiscal
performance than non-doillarizers. How, did they manage to be equally “irresponsible”
on the fiscal side, and yet maintain their monetary regime and have very low rates of
inflation? The answer to this query comes in two parts: First, the record shows that not
all the dollarized countries maintained the system. For instance, when the fiscal
constraint became too tight, Liberia abandoned dollarization. It is true that this
development took place in the midst of a civil conflict, but political upheaval is a reality

20

In a recent paper Levy-Yeyeti and Sturzenegger (2001) find out that countries with flexible exchange
rate regimes have grown faster than countries with fixed exchange rates.

of life among the poorer nations. Second, and as shown in section III, Panama has been
able to run large fiscal deficits by accumulating a large stock of debt – that it occasionally
restructures --, and by maintaining a very special relationship with the IMF. It is not
obvious that the IMF will be so friendly to future dollarizers that do not have Panama’s
geopolitical importance.
It is important to clarify what this study does not say. It does not say that
dollarization is the wrong policy option for all emerging markets. It does say, however,
that empirically we know very little about the costs and benefits of dollarization. It
further says that when the limited record is investigated, it does not appear to be as
positive as some analysts want us to believe. In that regard, the recent experiences of
Ecuador and El Salvador should provide important information that will help us assess
more fully the merits of dollarization in larger and somewhat more complex settings.
Overall, Mundell’s (1961) optimal currency areas analysis continues to be the
right approach for dealing with the dollarization question. There are good reasons to
think that countries that are highly integrated in terms of factor mobility and trade, will
benefit from having a common currency.21 The benefits from such a policy could more
than compensate the costs, including the loss of seignorage if the country dollarizes
unilaterally. Countries with a high degree of unofficial dollarization, and foreign
currency-denominated liabilities are also likely to benefit from dollarization. It is
unlikely, however, that dollarization will be the most adequate option for all countries.
Large countries that face volatile terms of trade, that are not deeply integrated to major
economies, and whose financial sector operate mostly in terms of domestic currency are
likely to incur in net costs if they dollarize. They will have difficulties in accommodating
external shocks while, as suggested by the results in this papers, the alleged benefits in
terms of low costs of capital, fiscal discipline and stability may, indeed, continue to be
elusive.

21

Recent interesting work by Rose (2000) and Frankel and Rose (2000) suggests that belonging to a
monetary union increases a country’s trade significantly. Whether this (potential) effect will be enough to
offset the costs of dollarization is still an open question. In a recent paper Persson (2001) argues that if a
treatment-correction methodology is used, the results from these studies do not hold anylonger.
