    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper addresses the issue of hedging option positions when the underlying asset exhibits stochastic volatility.  By parameterizing the volatility process as GARCH, and utilizing risk- neutral valuation, we estimate hedging parameters (delta and gamma) using Monte-Carlo simulation.  We estimate hedging parameters for options on the Standard and Poor's 500 index, a bond futures index, a weighted foreign exchange rate index, and an oil futures index. We find that Black-Scholes and GARCH deltas are similar for all the options considered, while GARCH gammas are significantly higher than BS gammas for all options.  For near the money options, GARCH gamma hedge ratios are higher than BS hedge ratios when hedging a long term option with a short term option.  Away from the money, GARCH gamma hedge ratios are lower than BS.\n\n",
