COLLAPSING EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES:
SHOCKS AND BIASES

ABSTRACT

Patterns in domestic credit creation stemming from inconsistent fiscal
policies have received widespread attention for aggrevating
speculative attacks on central b: k foreign exchange reserves and
contributing to the collapse of exchange rate regimes. This paper
acknowledges the importance of monetary and fiscal discipline, but
also emphasizes the importance of other random shocks to the domestic
money market, most notably shocks from external credit supplies and
relative prices.
Policies of the domestic fiscal authorities are only partial
catalysts for speculative attacks on a currency. Expansion of
domestic credit stemming from the monetization of fiscal imbalances
may be dominated by involuntary domestic credit expansions
necessitated by surprise shortages in supplies of external capital.
Further, the unexpected availability of external capital translates
into a lower net critical reserve floor, making the depletion of
central bank reserves by a speculative attack more difficult to
accomplish. Also of considerable importance are relative price shocks
which directly influence the probability of collapse by
randomizing
the demand for nominal money balances.
Empirical studies of exchange rate crises that neglect these
considerations will produce biased estimates of both expected
collapse
probabilities and anticipated post-collapse exchange rates.

INTRODUCTION'
The importance of exchange rate crises has been emphasized in a

growing body of theory concerned with sustainable policies and
stabilization. Models of exchange rate crises typically depict deficits in
the balance of payments leading to a gradual erosion of central bank
reserves followed hy a sharp, generally self-fulfilling speculative attack
on the currency which succeeds at collapsing the exchange regime.

The

timing and magnitu4e of such an attack is a function of general expected
profitability of such actions.

Expectations of profitability are taken

over the trend chsnges in relevant economic variables and over the range of
shocks that can affect the expected money market equilibrium and, in turn,
the exchange rate that would exist if an attack were to collapse the
exchange regime.

Patterns in domestic credit creation stemming from

inconsistent fiscal policies have received widespread attention for
contributing to speculative attacks on a currency.2 In this paper I
acknowledge the importance of monetary and fiscal discipline,

but also

emphasize the importance of other random shocks to the domestic money
market, most notably shocks from external credit supplies and relative
prices.

Policies of the domestic fiscal authorities are only partial

catalysts for speculative attacks on a currency.

Further,

the unexpected availability of external capital

translates into a lower net critical reserve floor, making the depletion of
central bank reserves by a speculative attack more difficult to accomplish.
Also of considerable importance are relative price shocks which directly
influence the probability of collapse by randomizing the demand for nominal
money balances.
The paper emphasizes that empirical studies of exchange rate crises
that neglect these considerations will produce biased estimates of both
expected collapse probabilities and anticipated post-collapse exchange
rates.

Since these estimation biases are one of the central themes of

this paper,

the starting point of the theoretical exposition is the most

frequently applied collapse model:
and Garber (1984).

the linear discrete-time model of Flood

Applications of this basic model have generated

estimates of collapse probabilities and expected post-collapse exchange
rates that are overstated to the extent that they have ignored the
importance of: 1) nontraded goods in the domestic consumption basket; 2)
positive and significant risk premia; 3) systematic deviations from
purchasing power parity (leading to relatively costly domestic nontraded
goods and potentially cheap exports);

and 4) significant real income

effects and currency substitution motives in the demand for real money
balances. Collapse probability estimates will be understated to the extent
that random behavior characterizes: 1) the price of traded goods relative
to nontraded goods; and 2) the availability of external credit supplies.

The paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 extends the Flood and

Garber (1984) linear discrete time model of a collapsing fixed exchange
rate,

introducing a range of stochastic variables. Section 3 uses

-3-

comparative statics to calculate the extent of probability and postcollapse exchange rate biases in estimation induced by faulty
specification. Section 4 concludes.

THE EXTENDED MODEL

Models of exchange rate crises and collapsing exchange rate regimes
depict deficits in the balance of payments leading to a gradual erosion and
then sharp speculative attack on central bank foreign exchange reserves.
This depletes reserves to the lowest level acceptable to the central bank
and eliminates the means by which the government can intervene in the
foreign exchange market.

As in the Mexican and Argentine experiences,

when this occurs the overvalued exchange rate can no longer be sustained
and the exchange regime collapses. The collapse can take the form of
either a discrete devaluation of the controlled exchange rate or a switch
to a floating exchange rate generally accompanied by a sharp currency
depreciation.
Following Salant and Henderson's (1978) application of a Hotelling
model of natural resource depletion to a speculative attack on government
gold stocks,

Krugman (1979) applied the speculative attack model to the

foreign exchange market.

Krugman showed that when future government policy

is known with certainty,

a balance of payments problem passes through

three stages:

a period of gradually declining reserves,

a sudden

speculative attack and a post-crisis period during which the currency is
allowed to depreciate. When monetary policy and the quantity of reserves
that the government is willing to commit to maintain the existing exchange
rate are not known,

the timing and magnitude of the speculative attack are

dependent upon the estimates of individuals who have incomplete knowledge.

-4-

The contribution of random domestic credit creation to the speculative
attack was also the driving force in Flood and Garber's (F-G) linear
discrete time model of a collapse.

Consistent with Suiter's (1986)

arguments, I note in this paper that uncertain government policy leading
uncertain or excessive domestic credit expansion may not be the most
important shock that can drive an economy to the brink of collapse.

For

this reason, I examine the relative importance of other shocks and restate
the intuition behind a speculative attack.

The probability of an exchange regime collapse generally is modelled
as the probability that an attack on central bank reserves will prove
rewarding to speculating agents.

Define the shadow exchange rate,

as

the exchange rate that would prevail in a post-collapse equilibrium. The
probability of attack then is the probability that

As nontraded goods become systematically more expensive relative to
traded goods [Connolly and Taylor (1984)] the demand for real money

rate.

Implicit in this statement is the relatively inelastic demand for

such nontradeables as services.

As documented by Calvo (1983), such a

sharp increase in the relative price of nontraded goods in Argentina
occured in the two and one half years preceding the May 1981 sharp
devaluation of the peso.

However, if the anticipation of a devaluation

Wijnbergen (1988) applied a similar model to the crawling peg experiente of
Argentina between 1979 and 1981.

Despite the previously discussed

troubling assumptiona embedded in the basic model, these applications
performed well qualitatively.
For the most part,

the assumptions of the basic Flood and Garber

(1984) tollapse model were retained in these applications. Consequently,
any collapse probability (and shadow exchange rate) estimates generated
were understated to the extent that prites and external credit supplies
exhibit short term randomness.

Collapse probability estimates were

overstated to the extent that there are: nontraded goods in the domestic
consumption basket;

positive and significant risk premia;

systematic

deviations from purchasing-power-parity; and currency substitution motives
influencing the demand for real balances.

Goldberg (1988) found eath of

these extenaions statistically significant in applications to the
experiences of Mexico and Argentina.

4. Concluding Remarks

This paper has extended the Flood-Garber discrete time collapse model to
include a range of random influences on the money market.

Though exceaaive

and volatile domestic credit creation generally is perceived as the primary
force behind a speculative attack, the reasons for domestic redit creation
should be examined carefully and specifically addressed before policy
prescriptions are recommended for a crisis country.

It is possible that

unstable external credit supplies contribute more to the onset of a
speculative attatk than do

anticipated fiscal shortages or surpluses.

Highly variable relative prices may also have a more significant role than
variable domestic fiscal policies in triggering speculative attacks on
:entral bank reserves.
Recent empirical applications of the basic model potentially will have
biased estimates of collapse probabilities and shadow exchange rates to the
sxtent that the extensions presented in this paper are statistically
significant.
