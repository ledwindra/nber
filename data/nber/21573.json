    "abstract": "\n\nThe majority of the world\u2019s countries have antidumping (AD) statutes in place, hundreds of AD actions occur annually across these countries, and AD criteria and procedures have been codified in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor, the World Trade Organization. AD\u2019s unique characteristics along with its high incidence of use make it a particularly apt policy for studying numerous trade theories and political economy models.  We review the economics literature on dumping and antidumping activity, with particular emphasis on the evolution of the literature and the most recent contributions.  We also point the reader to resources and rich data available to study AD, as well as our thoughts (in a concluding section) on where scholars should next focus their attention in this literature.\n\n",
