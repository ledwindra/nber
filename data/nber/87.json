We cannot solve the fundamental dilemma of the inability to run controlled experiments to determine what would happened in a given instance without direct governmental investment, but we have assembled a better set of data than was available to previous studies.  From these we hope to narrow the range of plausible assumptions and, from there on, the range of plausible conclusions.  This paper describes some experiments with our data set on a single industry: pharmaceuticals.\n\n",
