Multiple Equilibria in Open Economy Models with Collateral Constraints: Overborrowing
Revisited

May 2016
JEL No. E44,F41,G01,H23
ABSTRACT
This paper establishes the existence of multiple equilibria in infinite-horizon open- economy
models in which the value of tradable and nontradable endowments serves as collateral. In this
environment, the economy displays self-fulfilling financial crises in which pessimistic views
about the value of collateral induces agents to deleverage. The paper shows that under plausible
calibrations, there exist equilibria with underborrowing. This result stands in contrast to the
overborrowing result stressed in the related literature. Underborrowing emerges in the present
context because in economies that are prone to self-fulfilling financial crises, individual agents
engage in excessive precautionary savings as a way to self-insure.

Introduction

Open-economy models with collateral constraints display a pecuniary externality. The externality originates in the fact that the price of pledgable objects is endogenous to the model
but exogenous to individual agents. A result stressed in the literature is that these economies
overborrow, that is, they borrow more than they would if agents internalized the externality
(Bianchi, 2011; Korinek, 2011; Jeanne and Korinek, 2010). In turn, overborrowing causes
deeper and more frequent financial crises.
A second type of instability caused by the aforementioned pecuniary externality, which
has been given less attention in the literature, is the emergence of nonconvexities whereby in
the aggregate an increase in borrowing relaxes the collateral constraint. This perverse relationship arises for plausible calibrations. It can give rise to multiple equilibria, as shown by
Jeanne and Korinek (2010) in the context of an economy with a stock collateral constraint.
The first contribution of this paper is to extend this result by showing analytically that nonconvexities can give rise to multiple equilibria in the context of open economy models with
flow collateral constraints in which borrowing is limited by the value of tradable and nontradable endowments. This result is of interest because this type of collateral constraint is widely
used in the open-economy literature on pecuniary externalities (e.g., Bianchi, 2011; Benigno
et al. 2013 and 2014; Ottonello, 2015). We show that in this environment, self-fulfilling
financial crises can emerge as a result of pessimistic views about the value of collateral that
induce agents to deleverage. The second contribution of this paper is to show that in these
equilibria agents borrow less than they would if they could internalize the pecuniary externality. Thus, multiplicity of equilibrium gives rise to underborrowing, in the sense that if
the government applies capital control taxes optimally, the level of external debt is higher
than in the unregulated competitive equilibrium. Underborrowing is the result of excessive
self-insurance on the part of the private sector as a means to cope with an environment prone
to self-fulfilling collapses in the value of collateral.
Ramsey-optimal policy is mute with respect to implementation. In the context of the
present analysis, this means that the Ramsey-optimal capital control policy is consistent with
the Ramsey optimal allocation, but can also be consistent with other nonoptimal allocations.
A natural question is therefore what kind of capital control policy can implement the Ramsey
optimal allocation. The third contribution of the paper is to explicitly address the issue of
implementation. In particular, we show that capital control policies that are triggered by
sudden and discrete bursts in capital outflows can avoid self-fulfilling financial crises and
implement the Ramsey optimal allocation. According to this class of capital control policies,
the government threatens to tax capital flight if a panic attack induces agents to collectively

1

deleverage. This threat discourages nonfundamental runs on the country’s debt, leaving as
the sole possible equilibrium the Ramsey-optimal one.
Existing quantitative studies avoid the multiplicity problem by choosing calibrations for
which nonconvexities are absent. This concern in choosing model parameterizations is explicitly mentioned, for instance, in Jeanne and Korinek (2010) in the context of a stock-collateralconstraint model and in Benigno et al. (2014) in the context of a flow-collateral-constraint
model, and is implicit in the parameterizations adopted in Bianchi (2011) and Ottonello
(2015), among others. A central quantitative contribution of the present paper is to depart
from this practice by solving for equilibrium dynamics in the presence of nonconvexities. We
show that under plausible calibrations, the presence of nonconvexities can give rise to equilibria exhibiting underborrowing. This result stands in contrast to the overborrowing result
stressed in the related literature. In an economy calibrated with parameters typically used
in the emerging-market business-cycle literature and fed with shocks estimated on quarterly
Argentine data, we find equilibria in which the unregulated economy underborrows.
An exception to the standard overborrowing result stressed in the quantitative literature
on pecuniary externalities due to collateral constraints is Benigno, Chen, Otrok, Rebucci,
and Young (2013). The main departure of this paper from the related literature is that
it considers a production economy. In an environment with production, the social planner
sustains more debt than in the competitive economy by engineering sectoral employment
allocations conducive to elevated values of the collateral in terms of tradable goods. The
result of this paper is complementary but different from the one presented here. In the
present study, underborrowing arises even in the context of an endowment economy and is
due to the multiplicity of equilibrium caused by the dependence of the value of collateral on
the aggregate level of external debt.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an open economy
with a flow collateral constraint in which tradable and nontradable output has collateral
value. Section 3 characterizes analytically multiplicity of equilibrium. It shows the existence
of up to two equilibria with self-fulfilling crashes in the value of collateral. Section 4 studies
Ramsey optimal capital control policy. It shows that the unregulated economy underborrows relative to the economy with Ramsey optimal capital controls. Section 5 presents a
capital-control policy rule that can implement the Ramsey optimal allocation. Section 6
quantitatively characterizes debt dynamics in a stochastic economy in which agents coordinate on equilibria driven by pessimistic beliefs and establishes that underborrowing occurs
under plausible calibrations. Section 7 concludes.

An Economy With A Flow Collateral Constraint

A large number of studies of open economies with collateral constraints assume that the
object that serves as collateral is a flow. We will focus on the case in which tradable and
nontradable output have collateral value, which is the type of flow collateral constraint
most frequently studied in the related literature. Under this formulation, the source of
pecuniary externalities is the relative price of nontradable goods in terms of tradables, or
the real exchange rate. The collateral constraint gives rise to a pecuniary externality because
individual households fail to internalize the effect of their borrowing decision on the relative
price of nontradables and hence the value of their own collateral. As a result, the equilibrium
features inefficient credit booms and contractions. This type of flow collateral constraint
was introduced in open economy models by Mendoza (2002). The externality that emerges
when debt is denominated in tradables goods but leveraged on nontradable income and
the consequent room for macroprudential policy was emphasized by Korinek (2007) in the
context of a three-period model. Bianchi (2011) extends the Korinek model to an infinitehorizon framework and derives quantitative predictions for optimal prudential policy.
Consider a small open endowment economy in which households have preferences of the
form

β tU(ct ),

t=0

where ct denotes consumption in period t, U(·) denotes an increasing and concave period
utility function, β ∈ (0, 1) denotes a subjective discount factor, and Et denotes the expecta-

tions operator conditional on information available in period t. The period utility function
takes the form U(c) = (c1−σ − 1)/(1 − σ) with σ > 0. We assume that consumption is a

composite of tradable and nontradable goods of the form

risk-free, internationally-traded bond denominated in terms of tradable goods that pays
the interest rate rt when held from periods t to t + 1. The household’s sequential budget
constraint is given by
T

cTt + pt cN
t + dt = yt + pt yt +

(3)

where dt denotes the amount of debt due in period t and dt+1 denotes the amount of debt
assumed in period t and maturing in t + 1. The variable pt denotes the relative price of
3

nontradables in terms of tradables, and ytT and ytN denote the endowments of tradables and
nontradables, respectively. Both endowments are assumed to be exogenously given. The
collateral constraint takes the form
dt+1 ≤ κ(ytT + pt ytN ),

(4)

where κ > 0 is a parameter. Households internalize this borrowing limit. However, this
borrowing constraint introduces an externality, because each individual household takes the
real exchange rate, pt , as exogenously determined, even though their collective absorptions
of nontradable goods is a key determinant of this relative price. From the perspective of the
individual household, the collateral constraint is well behaved, in the sense that the higher
the debt level the tighter the collateral constraint becomes.
Households choose a set of processes {cTt , cN
t , ct , dt+1 } to maximize (1) subject to (2)-(4),

given the processes {rt , pt , ytT , ytN } and the initial debt position d0 . The first-order conditions
of this problem are (2)-(4) and

where β tλt and β t λt µt denote the Lagrange multipliers on the sequential budget constraint (3)
and the collateral constraint (4), respectively. As usual, the Euler equation (7) equates the
marginal benefit of assuming more debt with its marginal cost. During tranquil times, when
the collateral constraint does not bind, one unit of debt payable in t + 1 increases tradable
consumption by 1/(1 + rt ) units in period t, which increases utility by λt /(1 + rt ). The
marginal cost of an extra unit of debt assumed in period t and payable in t + 1 is the
marginal utility of consumption in period t + 1 discounted at the subjective discount factor,
βEtλt+1 . During financial crises, when the collateral constraint binds, the marginal utility of
increasing debt falls to [1/(1 + rt ) − µt ]λt , reflecting a shadow penalty for trying to increase
debt when the collateral constraint is binding.

given processes {rt , ytT , ytN } and the initial condition d0 .

The fact that cTt appears on the right-hand side of the equilibrium version of the collateral

constraint (12) means that during contractions in which the absorption of tradables falls,
the collateral constraint endogenously tightens. Individual agents do not take this effect into
account in choosing their consumption plans. This is the nature of the pecuniary externality
in this model.
From the perspective of the individual household, equations (3) and (4) define a convex
set of feasible debt choices, dt+1 . That is, if two debt levels d1 and d2 satisfy (3) and (4), then
any weighted average αd1 + (1 − α)d2 for α ∈ [0, 1] also satisfies these two conditions. From

an equilibrium perspective, however, this ceases to be true in general. The reason is that
the relative price of nontradables, pt , which appears on the right-hand side of the collateral
constraint (4) is increasing in consumption of tradables by equation (6), which, in turn, is
increasing in dt+1 by the resource constraint (11). To see this, use equilibrium condition (11)
to eliminate cTt from equilibrium condition (12) to obtain

It is clear from this expression that the right-hand side is increasing in the equilibrium level
of external debt, dt+1 . Moreover, depending on the values assumed by the parameters κ, a,
and ξ, the equilibrium value of collateral may increase more than one for one with dt+1 . In

5

other words, an increase in debt, instead of tightening the collateral constraint may relax it.
In this case, the more indebted the economy becomes, the less leveraged it is. As we will
see shortly, this possibility can give rise to multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling drops in the
value of collateral. Furthermore, if the intratemporal elasticity of substitution ξ is less than
unity, which is the case of greatest empirical relevance for many countries (Akinci, 2011),
the equilibrium value of collateral is convex in the level of debt. This property may cause
the emergence of two distinct values of dt+1 for which the collateral constraint binds and two
disjoint intervals of debt levels for which the collateral constraint is slack.

Self-Fulfilling Financial Crises

The focus of this section is to characterize self-fulfilling financial crises under flow collateral
constraints. For analytical convenience, assume that the CRRA period utility function and
the CES aggregator function introduced above satisfy σ = 1/ξ = 2, which is an empirically
plausible case. We simplify the economy by assuming that the tradable and nontradable
endowments and the interest rate are constant and equal to ytT = y T , ytN = 1, and rt = r,
for all t. Further, assume that a = 0.5, and β(1 + r) = 1. Given these assumptions, the
equilibrium conditions (10)-(13) can be written as

with cTt > 0 and µt ≥ 0 and d0 given.

Let us first characterize conditions under which an equilibrium exists in which traded
consumption and debt are constant for all t ≥ 0, that is, an equilibrium in which cTt = cT0
and dt = d0 for all t ≥ 0, where d0 is given. We refer to this equilibrium as a steady-state

equilibrium. By (15), in a steady-state equilibrium µt = 0 for all t. This means that in a
steady-state equilibrium the slackness condition (18) is also satisfied for all t.

We refer to this expression as the steady-state collateral constraint. Figure 1 displays the

The left-hand side is the 45◦ line. The right-hand side, shown with the thick solid line, is a
quadratic expression with a minimum at the natural debt limit d̄ ≡ y T (1 + r)/r. It follows

that the steady-state collateral constraint is well behaved, in the sense that the higher is the

side of the collateral constraint equals κy T and the left-hand side equals y T (1 + r)/r. We
assume that κ < (1 + r)/r, so that at d¯ the left-hand side is larger than the right-hand side,
and the steady-state collateral constraint is violated. Let d̃ < d¯ be the value of d at which
the steady-state collateral constraint (19) holds with equality, that is, the value of d at which
the right-hand side of the steady-state collateral constraint crosses the 45◦ line as indicated
in the figure. Any value of initial debt, d0 , less than or equal to d̃ satisfies the steady-state
collateral constraint (19). Since we have already shown that a constant value of debt also
satisfies all other equilibrium conditions, we have demonstrated that any initial value of debt
less than or equal to d̃ can be supported as a steady state equilibrium.
Do there exist other equilibria? The answer is yes. Consider an economy with an initial
debt level d0 < d˜ as shown in figure 2. The figure reproduces from figure 1 the right-hand
side of the steady-state collateral constraint (19) shown with a thick solid line. Because in
the graph the initial level of debt, d0 , satisfies d0 < d̃, we have from the previous analysis that
dt = d0 for all t can be supported as an equilibrium. Now consider the collateral constraint

expressed as a function of the level of debt in period 1, denoted by d. We refer to expression (20) as the period-0 collateral constraint. The figure plots the right-hand side of the
period-0 collateral constraint with a broken line. The right-hand sides of the period-0 and
steady-state collateral constraints intersect when d = d0 , point A in the figure. At point A,

The right-hand side of the period-0 collateral constraint can cross the 45◦ line to the

left of d0 either zero or two times. Suppose that it crosses the 45◦ line twice, as shown in
figure 2. This is possible for some parameter configurations.1 At the crossing with the higher
debt level, indicated by point B in the figure, the slope of the right-hand side of the period-0
collateral constraint must be positive. This means that at point B, cT0 is positive (recall
that the slope of the period-0 collateral constraint is 2κ/(1 + r)cT0 . We wish to show that
point B can be supported as an equilibrium. In this equilibrium dt = d1 < d0 for all t > 0.
To establish this result, we must show that equilibrium conditions (15)-(18) are satisfied for
all t ≥ 0, with cTt > 0 and µt ≥ 0. We have already shown that cT0 > 0 at point B. Now

note that at point B the collateral constraint is binding in period 0, since the right-hand
side of the period-0 collateral constraint crosses the 45◦ line, which is the left-hand side of

the period-0 collateral constraint. Thus, equilibrium conditions (17) and (18) are satisfied in
period 0. Also, the facts that d1 < d0 and d1 = d2 imply that cT0 < cT1 , which can be verified
by comparing the resource constraint (16) evaluated at t = 0 and t = 1. In turn, cT0 < cT1
implies, by the Euler equation (15), that a strictly positive value of the Lagrange multiplier
µ0 makes the Euler equation hold with equality in period 0. This establishes that the debt
˜
level associated with point B satisfies all equilibrium conditions in period 0. Since d1 < d,
we have, from the preceding analysis of steady-state equilibria, that dt = d1 for all t ≥ 1

can be supported as an equilibrium. This completes the proof of the existence of multiple
equilibria, one with dt = d0 for all t ≥ 0 and the collateral constraint never binding, and

another one with d1 < d0 and the collateral constraint binding in period 0 and never binding
thereafter. The latter equilibrium takes place at a level of period-1 debt at which, from an
aggregate point of view, the period-0 collateral constraint behaves perversely in the sense
that more borrowing would loosen rather than tighten the borrowing restriction.
The intuition behind the existence of the second equilibrium is as follows. Imagine the

economy being originally in a steady state with debt constant and equal to d0 . Unexpectedly,
the public becomes pessimistic and aggregate demand contracts. The contraction in aggregate demand means that households want to consume less of both types of good, tradable
and nontradable. Because nontradables are in fixed supply, their relative price, p0 , must fall
to bring about market clearing. As a result, the value of collateral, given by κ(y T + p0 y N ),
also falls. This reduction in collateral is so large that it forces households to deleverage.
This generalized decline in the value of collateral represents the quintessential element of
a financial crisis. To reduce their net debt positions, households must cut spending, validating the initial pessimistic sentiments, and making the financial crisis self-fulfilling. The
contraction in the debt position and the fall in the relative price of nontradables imply that
the self-fulfilling financial crisis occurs in the context of a current account surplus and a
depreciation of the real exchange rate.
Figure 2 displays a period-0 collateral constraint that crosses the 45◦ line once with a
positive slope (point B) and once with a negative slope (point C). Point C cannot be an
equilibrium because it is associated with negative period-0 consumption, cT0 < 0. To see this,
recall that the slope of the period-0 collateral constraint in period 0 is given by 2κ/(1 + r)cT0 .
So if the slope is negative, so is cT0 .
Debt levels between points A and B cannot be equilibria of the type discussed here,
even though these debt levels are feasible in the sense that they satisfy the resource and
collateral constraints. They cannot represent equilibria because they fail to satisfy the Euler
equation (15) in period 0. To see this, note that at such points the period-0 collateral
constraint is slack, implying that µ0 = 0. We also have that at any point between A and B

cT1 is strictly higher than cT0 , since the economy deleverages in period 0 and is in a steadystate equilibrium in period 1. This means that at any point between A and B, the left-hand
side of the Euler equation (15) is larger than its right-hand side.
However, if the period-0 collateral constraint crosses the 45◦ line twice with a positive
slope and before d̃, as shown in figure 3, then a third equilibrium emerges (point C). The
proof of this claim is identical to the one establishing that point B is an equilibrium. A third
equilibrium of this type entails a larger drop in the value of collateral and more deleveraging than in the equilibrium associated with point B. This suggests that in the current
environment self-fulfilling financial crisis can come in different sizes.

Underborrowing

The pecuniary externality created by the presence of the relative price of nontradables in
the collateral constraint induces an allocation that is in general suboptimal, not only when
compared to the allocation that would result in the absence of a collateral constraint, but
also relative to the best allocation possible among all of the ones that satisfy the collateral
constraint. As a result, the collateral constraint opens the door to welfare improving policy
intervention.
The standard result in the literature on pecuniary externalities due to a flow collateral
constraint of the type studied here is that the unregulated economy overborrows. That is,
external debt is higher than it would be if households internalized the pecuniary externality. The focus of this section is to establish whether overborrowing continues to obtain in
economies exhibiting multiple equilibria.
10

The policy intervention we consider here is capital controls. This instrument is of interest for two reasons. First, the optimal capital control policy fully internalizes the pecuniary
externality, in the sense that it induces the representative household to behave as if it understood that its own borrowing choices influence the relative price of nontradables and therefore
the value of collateral. Second, capital controls are of interest because they represent a tax on
external borrowing, which is the variable most directly affected by the pecuniary externality.
We assume that the government is benevolent in the sense that it seeks to maximize the
well being of the representative household. Further, we assume that the government has the
ability to commit to policy promises. That is, we characterize the Ramsey optimal capital
control policy in the context of an open economy with a flow collateral constraint.
Let τt be a proportional tax on debt acquired in period t. If τt is positive, it represents a
proper capital control tax, whereas if it is negative it has the interpretation of a borrowing
subsidy. The revenue from capital control taxes is given by τt dt+1 /(1 + rt ). We assume that
the government consumes no goods and that it rebates all revenues from capital controls to
the public in the form of lump-sum transfers (lump-sum taxes if τt < 0), denoted `t .2 The
budget constraint of the government is then given by
τt

The household’s sequential budget constraint now becomes

t + dt = yt + pt y + (1 − τt )

+ `t .
1 + rt

It is apparent from this expression that the capital control tax distorts the borrowing decision
of the household. In particular, the gross interest rate on foreign borrowing perceived by
the private household is no longer 1 + rt , but (1 + rt )/(1 − τt ). All other things equal, the
higher is τt , the higher is the interest rate perceived by households. Thus, by changing τt
the government can encourage or discourage borrowing. All optimality conditions associated

with the household’s optimization problem (equations (5)-(9)) are unchanged, except for the
debt Euler equation (7), which now takes the form

A competitive equilibrium in the economy with capital control taxes is then a set of

Alternatively, one could assume that revenues from capital control taxes are rebated by means of a
proportional income transfer. Since tradable and nontradable income is exogenous to the household, this
transfer would be nondistorting and therefore equivalent to a lump-sum transfer.

The benevolent government sets capital control taxes to maximize the household’s lifetime
utility subject to the restriction that the optimal allocation be supportable as a competitive
equilibrium. It follows that all of the above competitive equilibrium conditions are constraints of the Ramsey government’s optimization problem. Formally, the Ramsey-optimal
competitive equilibrium is a set of processes τt , cTt , dt+1 , λt , µt , and pt that solve the problem

subject to (22)-(28), given processes ytT and rt and the initial condition d0 . In the welfare
function above, we have replaced consumption of nontradables, cN
t , with the endowment
of nontradables, y N , because the Ramsey planner takes into account that in a competitive
equilibrium the market for nontradables clears at all times.
The above set of equilibrium conditions can be reduced to two expressions. Specifically,
processes cTt and dt+1 satisfy equilibrium conditions (22)-(28) if and only if they satisfy (22)

To see this, suppose cTt and dt+1 satisfy (22) and (30). We must establish that (22)-(28) are
also satisfied. Obviously, the resource constraint (22) holds. Now pick pt to satisfy (26). This
is possible, because the process cTt is given. Use this expression to eliminate pt from (23).
The resulting expression is (30), establishing that (23) holds. Next, pick λt to satisfy (24).
12

Now, set µt = 0 for all t. It follows immediately that the slackness condition (27) and the
non-negativity condition (28) are satisfied. Finally, pick τt to ensure that (25) holds, that is,
τt = 1 − β(1 + rt )Et

Next, we need to show the reverse statement, that is, that processes cTt and dt+1 that satisfy (22)-(28) also satisfy (22) and (30). Obviously, (22) is satisfied, and combining (23)
with (26) yields (30). This completes the proof of the equivalence of the constraint set
(22)-(28) and the constraint set (22) and (30).

Comparing the levels of debt in the Ramsey equilibrium and in the unregulated equilibrium (i.e., the equilibrium without government intervention), we can determine whether the
lack of optimal government intervention results in overborrowing or underborrowing.
Consider the Ramsey optimal allocation in the perfect-foresight economy analyzed in
˜ as shown in figure 2.
section 3. Suppose that the initial value of debt, d0 , satisfies d0 < d,
Since one possible competitive equilibrium is dt = d0 and cTt = y T − rd0 /(1 + r) for all t ≥ 0,
and since this equilibrium is the first best equilibrium (i.e., the equilibrium that would
result in the absence of the collateral constraint), it also has to be the Ramsey optimal
equilibrium. The capital control tax associated with the Ramsey optimal equilibrium can
be deduced from inspection of equation (31). Because consumption of tradables is constant
over time and because in this analytical example β(1 + r) = 1, it follows that τt = 0 for all
t ≥ 0.
Compare now the level of debt in the Ramsey optimal allocation with the one associated
with the unregulated competitive equilibrium. Here, we must take into account that there
are multiple unregulated competitive equilibria. Consider first the case of two unregulated
equilibria, depicted as points A and B in figure 2. Suppose the unregulated competitive
equilibrium happens to be the one in which the collateral constraint binds in period 0, point

13

B in figure 2. In this case the unregulated economy underborrows at all times, since the
level of debt at point B is less than the Ramsey optimal level of debt, d0 . If, on the other
hand, the unregulated competitive equilibrium happens to be the unconstrained equilibrium
(point A in the figure), then there is neither underborrowing nor overborrowing, since its
associated level of debt coincides with the Ramsey optimal level, d0 . Thus, in this economy,
there is either underborrowing or optimal borrowing, depending on whether the competitive
equilibrium happens to be the constrained or the unconstrained one.
Similarly, in the economy depicted in figure 3, which has three unregulated equilibria,
given by points A, B, and C, the Ramsey optimal equilibrium is at point A, with constant
consumption and capital control taxes equal to zero at all times. If the economy coordinates
on equilibria B or C, it underborrows, and if it coordinates on equilibrium A, it neither
underborrows nor overborrows.

Implementation

The Ramsey optimal policy is mute with regard to equilibrium implementation. In the
context of the economy studied in the previous section, this means that the Ramsey optimal
policy τt = 0 does not guarantee that the competitive equilibrium will be the Ramsey optimal
one (e.g., point A in figures 2 and 3). In particular, the policy rule τt = 0 for all t may
result in an unintended competitive equilibrium, like point B in figure 2 or points B or C
in figure 3. Thus a policy of setting τt = 0 at all times may fail to implement the Ramsey
optimal allocation. However, any capital-control policy that succeeds in implementing the
Ramsey optimal allocation must deliver τt = 0 for all t in equilibrium. The difference between
a policy that sets τt = 0 under all circumstances and a policy capable of implementing the
Ramsey-optimal allocation is not the capital control tax that results in equilibrium, but the
tax rates that would be imposed off equilibrium.
To shed light on the issue of implementation, here we study a capital-control feedback
rule capable of bringing about the Ramsey-optimal equilibrium in the model economy of
section 3. Specifically, consider the capital control policy
τt = τ (dt+1 , dt )
satisfying τ (d, d) = 0. According to this rule, capital controls depend, not on the level of
debt, but on the magnitude of capital flows. Under this tax-policy rule, the Euler equation

14

in period 0 (e.g., the combination of equations (24) and (25) evaluated at t = 0) becomes
cT1
1
=p
.
T
c0
1 − τ (d1, d0 ) − (1 + r)µ0

(32)

In the intended (Ramsey) equilibrium, we have that cT1 /cT0 = 1, that d1 = d0 , and that
µ0 = 0, so the Euler equation holds and τ (d1 , d0 ) = 0. This means that the proposed policy
is consistent with the Ramsey optimal allocation.
But the same capital control policy can rule out the unintended equilibria. Recalling
that cT0 and cT1 satisfy cT0 = y T + d1 /(1 + r) − d0 and cT1 = y T − rd1 /(1 + r), we can write the
Euler equation (32) as
y T − rd1 /(1 + r)
1
=p
.
T
y + d1 /(1 + r) − d0
1 − τ (d1, d0 ) − (1 + r)µ0

(33)

Now pick the function τ (·, ·) in such a way that if a self-fulfilling crisis occurs and the economy
deleverages, then the Euler equation holds only if µ0 is negative. Specifically, set τ (d1 , d0 )
to satisfy

y T − rd1 /(1 + r)
1
<p
.
T
y + d1 /(1 + r) − d0
1 − τ (d1 , d0 )

for all d1 < d0 .3 Clearly, this policy requires τ (d1 , d0 ) > 0 if d1 < d0 . Under this capital
control policy, the Euler equation would not hold for any value of d1 less than d0 , since it
would require µ0 < 0, which violates the nonnegativity constraint (28). This means that any
equilibrium in which the economy deleverages is ruled out.
The capital control policy that rules out self-fulfilling crises and ensures that only the
Ramsey optimal (and first-best) equilibrium emerges is one in which the policy maker is
committed to imposing capital control taxes in the case of capital outflows, that is, if d1 < d0 .
This type of capital control policy serves as a metaphor for a variety of policies that are often
contemplated in emerging countries during financial panics and that aim at temporarily
restricting capital outflows, including restrictions on foreign exchange markets and profit
and dividend repatriations. In the present perfect-foresight economy, the mere threat of
the imposition of capital control taxes in the case of capital outflows suffices to fend off
self-fulfilling crises and thus such taxes never need to be deployed in equilibrium.
3

An example of a policy that satisfies this restriction is τ (d1 , d0 ) = 1 −
α > 0.

Underborrowing In A Stochastic Economy

We now characterize numerically the debt dynamics in a stochastic version of the flow
collateral-constrained economy presented in section 2. To this end, we assume a joint
stochastic process for the tradable endowment and the country interest rate and calibrate
the structural parameters of the model to match certain features of the Argentine economy.
We calibrate the model at a quarterly frequency. Table 1 summarizes the calibration.
We set κ so that the upper limit of net external debt is 30 percent of annual output. This
value is in line with those used in the quantitative literature on output-based flow collateral
constraints (e.g., Bianchi, 2011). Because the time unit in the model is a quarter, this
calibration restriction implies a value of κ of 1.2 (= 0.3×4). The calibration of the remaining
parameters follows Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016). We set β = 0.9635, σ = 1/ξ = 2,
a = 0.26, and y N = 1. The exogenous variables ytT and rt are assumed to follow a bivariate
AR(1) process of the form

Equilibrium Approximation

To approximate the equilibrium, we develop an Euler equation iteration procedure over a
discretized state space. The appendix describes the numerical algorithm. The economy
possesses two exogenous states, ytT and rt , and one endogenous state, dt . We discretize ln ytT
using 21 evenly spaced points centered at 0 and discretize ln(1 + rt)/(1 + r) using 11 evenly
spaced points centered at 0. Thus, both grids are symmetric. The upper bound of the grids
√
of ln ytT and ln((1+rt )/(1+r)) are taken to be the 10 times the corresponding unconditional
standard deviations implied by the estimated VAR system (34). The resulting intervals are

As in the analytical example of section 3, the present economy features a collateral
constraint that in equilibrium may intersect the 45-degree line twice with a positive slope,
implying that the set of values dt+1 that satisfy both the period-t resource constraint and the
period-t collateral constraint may not be convex. For example, figure 4 displays the value
of collateral as a function of dt+1 for the state (ytT , rt, dt ) = (0.7633, 0.0541, 1.5960). In this
state, there are two disjoint sets of dt+1 for which the collateral constraint is satisfied. In
between these two sets, the price of nontradables is too low to guarantee the satisfaction of the
borrowing limit. More than one third of all possible states (ytT , rt , dt ) display nonconvexities
of the type shown in figure 4.
The numerical solution must take a stance on how to handle the possibility of indeterminacy of the rational expectations equilibrium of the type identified in section 3. Failing
to address this issue may result in nonconvergence of numerical algorithms. Specifically,
we focus on two canonical equilibrium selection mechanisms suggested by the preceding
theoretical analysis.
(b) If for a given current state (ytT , rt , dt ) there are one or more values of dt+1 for which
all equilibrium conditions are satisfied pick the largest one for which the collateral constraint
is binding.

debt choices, or a subset of debt choices, for which all equilibrium conditions are satisfied.
Such equilibria may or may not exist. This type of search is beyond the scope of the present
study, for our objective here is to find equilibria displaying underborrowing of the type
identified in the analytical characterization presented in section 4.
A second aspect of the proposed solution algorithm is a forward-looking mechanism, we
call path-finder, that avoids debt choices that lead with positive probability to areas of the
state space for which either consumption is non-positive or the aggregate collateral constraint
is violated in the future. This refinement of the solution algorithm facilitates convergence in
the presence of nonconvexities in the aggregate feasible debt set.

multiple equilibria. The more pessimistic equilibrium selection criterion (c) (dash-dotted line
in the figure), which favors larger self-fulfilling debt crises, yields a debt distribution with a
mean of 12.0 percent of annual output. The distribution of debt associated with selection
criterion (b) is located to the right of the one associated with criterion (c), although the
difference is not large, only 0.4 percentage points of output on average. However, if one
were to attempt to compute the equilibrium assuming uniqueness, standard Euler-equation
iteration procedures will in general not converge.
To highlight the borrowing restrictions imposed by the collateral constraint, figure 6 displays the unconditional distribution of external debt, dt , in a version of the present economy
without a collateral constraint (solid line). For comparison, the figure reproduces the debt
distributions in the economy with the collateral constraint. The presence of the collateral
constraint significantly limits the ability of households to borrow. In the economy without
the collateral constraint, the mean debt to output ratio 46 percent, almost four times larger
than in the economy with the collateral constraint. Furthermore, the collateral constraint
compresses the debt distribution around its mean. The unconditional standard deviation
of the debt-to-output ratio is six times smaller in the collateral-constrained economy than
in the unconstrained economy (2 versus 12 percentage points of output). This does not
mean, however, that the collateral constraint is hit frequently. It actually turns out that the
contrary is the case. The collateral constraint almost never binds. Figure 7 plots the dis
tribution of leverage, defined as dt+1 / ytT + pt y N ) , as well as the upper bound on leverage

given by κ. It is apparent from this figure that the probability that the collateral constraint
binds is virtually nil. In fact, in a simulation of one million quarters, the constraint binds
only 287 times under equilibrium selection criterion (c) and 1,113 times under criterion (b).
This means that households choose to stay clear of the endogenous debt limit virtually all
of the time. They manage to avoid being caught with a binding constraint by engaging
in precautionary savings. They save because being up against the constraint forces them
to deleverage. This collective deleveraging causes the price of collateral to collapse, which
reinforces the need to deleverage, which in turn leads to even larger declines in consumption.
In section 4 we showed analytically that when the collateral constraint introduces nonconvexities, the unregulated competitive equilibrium can display underborrowing, in the sense
that the level of external debt is below the Ramsey-optimal level. Here, we show that this
result also obtains in a stochastic economy under a plausible calibration.
The Ramsey optimal allocation is relatively easy to compute because the Ramsey problem
can be cast in the form of a Bellman equation problem. Specifically, the recursive version of
the Ramsey problem of maximizing (29) subject to (22) and (30) is given by

where a prime superscript denotes next-period values. Although the constraints of this
control problem may not represent a convex set in tradable consumption and debt, the fact
that the Ramsey allocation is the result of a utility maximization problem, implies that its
solution is generically unique. The calibration of the economy is the same as that used for
the unregulated economy, summarized in table 1.

Figure 8 displays with a solid line the unconditional distribution of net external debt, dt ,
under Ramsey optimal capital control policy. For comparison, it reproduces from figure ??
the unconditional distributions of debt in the unregulated economy. The figure shows that the
unregulated economy displays underborrowing, in the sense that its debt distribution lies to
the left of the one associated with the Ramsey optimal capital control policy. The average
annual debt-to-output ratio in the Ramsey economy is 13.1 percentage points of output
compared with 12.4 and 12.0 percentage points of output in the unregulated economies (b)
and (c), respectively. In the unregulated economy, households have an incentive to over self
22

insure. This is due to the fact that the unregulated economy is highly fragile as it is more
prone to financial crises caused by a binding collateral constraint.

Conclusion

A peculiar aspect of open economy models in which borrowing is limited by the value of
tradable and nontradable output is that the equilibrium value of collateral is increasing in
the level of external debt. For plausible calibrations, this relationship can become perverse,
in the sense that an increase in debt increases collateral by more than one for one. That is,
as the economy becomes more indebted it becomes less leveraged. This problem can give
rise to a nonconvexity whereby two disjoint ranges of external debt for which the collateral
constraint is satisfied are separated by a range for which the collateral constraint is violated.
This paper shows that in this environment, the economy displays self-fulfilling financial
crises in which pessimistic views about the value of collateral induces agents to deleverage.
In the context of a stochastic economy and under plausible calibrations, the paper shows
that there exist equilibria with underborrowing, in the sense that the equilibrium level of
debt is lower than what is optimal for a Ramsey planner with access to capital control taxes.
The underborrowing result stands in contrast to the overborrowing result stressed in the
related literature. Underborrowing emerges in the present context because in economies that
are prone to self-fulfilling financial crises, individual agents engage in excessive precautionary
savings as a way to self insure.
The paper addresses the issue of implementation of the Ramsey optimal equilibrium.
This is a nontrivial problem, because the Ramsey optimal policy only specifies what taxes
are levied in the Ramsey equilibrium, but not what taxes would be levied off equilibrium.
As a result, the Ramsey-optimal capital control policy does not ensure implementation of
the Ramsey-optimal allocation. In particular, other, possibly welfare inferior, equilibria may
be consistent with the Ramsey-optimal capital control policy. This paper shows that a
capital control policy that threatens to tax capital outflows in the event of a self-fulfilling
financial crisis can make such events incompatible with a rational expectations equilibrium
and therefore eliminate them as possible outcomes, ensuring the emergence of the desired
equilibrium.

Appendix: Numerical Solution Algorithm
This appendix describes the numerical algorithm used to approximate the equilibrium of the
stochastic economy with a flow collateral constraint studied in section 6. The algorithm is a
modified Euler-equation iteration procedure. To handle the possibility of indeterminacy of
the rational expectations equilibrium of the type identified in section 3, we impose that the
algorithm either favors equilibria like point C or like point B in figure 4. In addition, the
algorithm does not allow choosing values of debt in period t for which there may exist no
choice of debt in period t + 1 for which consumption of tradables is positive and the collateral
constraint is satisfied. This refinement of the solution algorithm, which we call pathfinder,
facilitates convergence in the presence of nonconvexities in the aggregate feasible debt set.
1. Let y T , r, and d denote the state of the economy in the current period and d0 denote
debt next period. Note that d0 is in the information set of the current period.
2. Use the resource constraint (11) to compute consumption of tradables,
C T (y T , r, d, d0) ≡ y T + d0 /(1 + r) − d

an indicator function that takes the value 1 if C T (y T , r, d, d0 ) < 0 or d0 > M(y T , r, d, d0)

this indicator below to avoid debt choices that lead with positive probability to areas

algorithm as a path-finder.

4. Iteration n = 1, 2, . . . starts with a guess for the policy function of net external debt

The first constraint says that consumption of tradables must be strictly positive. The
second constraint says that the collateral constraint must be respected. And the third
constraint rules out next-period debt choices that will place the economy with positive

probability into areas of the state space next period for which Z(y T , r0, d0 ) = 1. This
constraint is the path-finder aspect of the solution algorithm.

EZ(y T , r0 , dj |y T , r, dj ) = 0
and
C T (y T , r, d, dj ) > 0,
where dj is the jth element of the debt grid. If dc exists for a given current state
(y T , r, d), check whether µn (y T , r, d, dc ) ≥ 0. If so, set Dn+1 (y T , r, d) = dc . If two such
values exist pick the smaller one for equilibrium selection criterion (c) and the larger
one for equilibrium selection criterion (b). This step ensures that the algorithm favors
equilibria like points B or C, respectively, in figure 4.
8. If
max |Dn+1 (y T , r, d) − Dn (y T , r, d)| < Tol

{yT ,r,d}

for some tolerance level Tol, the procedure is completed. We set Tol = 0. Else, go to
item 4. for a new iteration.
