A Monetary Equilibrium Model with Transactions Costs

ABSTRACT

This

paper presents the competitive equilibrium of an economy in

which people hold money for transactions purposes. It studies both the
steady states which result from different rates of monetary expansion
and the effects of such non—steady state events as an open market operation.

Even though the model features no uncertainty and perfect foresight, open

market operations affect aggregate output. In particular, a simultaneous
increase in money and governmental holdings of capital temporarily raises
aggregate capital and output while it lowers the real rate of interest
on capital.

INTRODUCTION
The objective of this paper is to study the competitive equilibrium of

an economy in which people hold money for transactions purposes. As in the
models of Baumol (1952), Tobin (1956), Stockman (1981), Townsend (1982) and
Jovanovic (1982), but in contrast to those of Grandmont and Vounes (1973),
Lucas (1980) and Helpman (1982), households are also allowed to hold interest

bearing capital in addition to barren money. The main advantage of the
present model is that it is able to shed light on the effects of sud
nonsteady state events as open market operations.
Households pick the path of consumption optimally from their point of

view. Because it is costly to carry out financial transactions, people visit
their financial intermediary only occasionally. However, I do not let households pick optimally the length of the period during which they do not visit

their bank. For tractability, the assumption is made that households have a
constant interval during which they carry out no financial transactions.
A crucial feature of this paper is that, as in all free market econ-

omies, different households visit their banks at different times. This leads
to conclusions which are strikingly "Keynesian". Government interventions,
and in particular open market operations, have the ability to affect aggregate

output and the real rate of interest. This is true even though the model
features no uncertainty, full information, perfect foresight and perfectly

competitive markets for goods and money. Moreover, the effects of monetary
policies closely resemble those found in standard textbooks. In particular, a

one

period monetary expansion leads to a higher level of output which persists

for some time. It also concurrently leads to low real interest rates.
The paper proceeds as follows: Section II
the

maximization problems of the households and the firms, as well as the

—2—
institutional environment. Section III presents the perfect foresight equilib—

rium of the economy. It is a difference equation which exhibits saddle path
stability near that steady state which has positive consumption. Section IV
studies steady state inflation and welfare. It establishes that the level of
output is independent of the rate of inflation but that inflation affects
welfare negatively by distorting the intertemporal consumption decisions.
Section V is the heart of the paper since it discusses monetary policy outside

the steady state. Finally, Section VI presents some conclusions.

II THE MODEL
There is only one good which can both be consumed and invested. Total
output produced by firms in period t (Q) depends, via a constant returns to
scale production function, on the amount of labor hired at t and on

the amount of the good which was produced but not consumed at t—l. Since an
amount of labor [ is assumed to be supplied inelastically:

Kt —1

where f is an increasing and concave function. Workers are assumed to be paid
their marginal product. Tnerefore, the total return, denominated in period t
goods, from foregoing the consumption of an additional good at t—l, is given

by l+rtl, where:

l+rtl =

There are 2n households. At time t, the households are assumed to
maximize the utility function given by:

where

is

a discount

factor. The households have access to two assets, money and claims on capi-

tal. Money is the only medium of exchange. Moreover, visits to the financial
intermediary for the purpose of converting claims on capital into money are

costly. Therefore, as in the inventory theoretical models of Baumol (1952)
and Tobin (1956), households engage in these visits only sporadically. In
this paper it will be assumed at the outset that households exchange capital

for money every two periods. The assumption that households do not change the
timing of their financial transactions in response to events, is made mainly

for tractability. Except in stationary environments, it is very difficult to
solve for the optimal timing of these visits, particularly when households
pick their consumption path optimally.
Without loss of' generality, suppose that household i engages in finan-

cial transactions in the "even" periods, t, t+2, t+4

At these dates it

withdraws an amount M' of' money balances which must be sufficient to

Here, B is the real cost of visiting the financial intermediary, while Y is
the noninvestment income of' the

household at 'r.

This noninvestment income

includes labor income as well as taxes and transfers from the government.
Equation (5) says that investments minus brokerage fees at t+2< have to be

equal

to total resources at ti-2k. These resources include the capitalized

values of'

ad of noncapital income at t-4-2k—l, as well as current

noncapital income. Note that (5)

explicitly

assumes that noncapital income

is directly invested in claims on capital. This assumption considerably

simplifies

the analysis.

The optimal path of consumption is found in two steps. First, I derive

consumption at T and Tl as a function of M. Then I derive the optimal values
of the sequence of monetary withdrawals.
The first step requires the maximization of:

Equation (8) asserts that the appropriately weighted sum of the instantaneous utilities at T and T+l increases with H1 / P but is negatively af-

Note

that both (11) and (7) state that the marginal rate of substitution times

a rate of return is equal to one. The important distinction between the two

is

that in (7) the rate of return is the rate of' return on money, while in

(11) it is the rate of' return on capital. Stochastic versions of (11) have
been statistically rejected using aggregate U.S. data by Mankiw (1981) and

Hansen and Singleton (1982). Their rejections may be due in part to their
neglect of the fact that in the presence of the transactions motive for
holding money, the ratio of marginal utilities of consumption separated by
different time intervals is related to rates of' return of assets with dif-

ferent characteristics.
Financial intermediaries receive the household's income and invest it in
claims on capital. They are also allowed to issue a certain quantity of'

money. The intermediaries are compensated for their services with the brokerage fees, B, of' (5).

Their function can best be understood by following

their .transactions in detail.
Between periods T and Tl the financial intermediaries have as their

assets the household's claims on capital as well as M units of money.

—6—
These can be thought

of' as deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank. Their

liabilities are the household's claims on capital and the amount of money, M,
that the households who came to the bank at T withdrew but did not spend at t.

In

period T--l, the financial intermediaries issue whatever amount of money

the households who visit them in period i-i-i require. The households then

buy goods from the firms. me firms return the money they receive from the
households to the intermediaries in partial payment of' their compensation to

workers and their debt to the households. The rest of'
the banks is then paid in the form of' claims on Tl

their

capital.

I also assume that half' the households (n) visit the intermediaries in

the even periods t,t÷2,t+4,..., and the other half carry out their financial

transactions in the odd periods. The fact that only a subset of the households visit financial intermediaries in any given day is one of the main

features of reality which this paper seeks to reflect. It also is a feature
of the steady states studied by Jovanovic (1982). It turns out that the
assumption that households stagger their financial transactions is crucial to

EQUILIBRIUM

The equilibrium for this economy is a path for the price level and for
the real rate of interest which when households maximize utility and firms

maximize profits ensures that:

The amount of money that households who visit the intermediary at

must be equal to M

Let C and CT be the consumptions at T of households who visit the

at will. The standard neoclassical optimum growth

issimply the problem of' this paper but with the requirement that

people can spend their claims on capital every period. This standard problem

has only one free initial condition, namely consumption in the first period.

-9Here, since I am dealing with two types of consumers situated rather differ-

ently two arbitrary initial conditions are required. The question remains
whether there exists a unique equilibrium which converges to a steady

state with positive consumption. As long as M/M1 converges to a constant,
the steady state values of capital (K*) have the following property:

LEf() —

K*]{l

The steady state values of K do not depend on the rate of monetary growth.

There are two types of steady states. Those with zero consumption are such

that output Cf(K*/C) is equal to investment, K*. The only steady state with
positive consumption has the property that pf'(K) =

1;

the product of' the

discount rate times the marginal product of capital is unity.

Unfortunately, I cannot establish the existence or
uniqueness of paths which converge to R. I can only present a local result.
Namely, that the linearized version around R of (20) is such that a unique
path which converges to R exists. The linearized version of' (20) around R is:

to minus one, while the other two roots are such that (x2—l)(x3—1) is negative,

is positive while (x2+x3)

is

positive. Therefore, A2 and A3 are both

positive and lie on opposite sides of' the unit circle. There is only one

stable root, say A3. A2 is such that if the initial conditions are not chosen

correctly, K either explodes or implodes. Finally, A such that unless
the initial conditions are appropriately chosen, capital is subject to

oscillations in the steady state. The arguments of Blanchard and Kahn (1980)
establish that for a unique nonexplosive equilibrium to exist, the number of
roots at or inside the unit circle must be equal to the number of predeter-

mined variables. Here there are two roots at or inside the unit circle and
only one predetermined variable. So there exists an infinity of nonexplosive
paths. However, there is only one path which does not oscillate in the steady
state.

IV.

INFLATION, STEADY STATES AND WELFARE
In Section III I established that there is no Tobin effect in this

model. Independently of' the value of Mt+l/Mt, the unique steady state value

of the capital stock which involves positive consumption is R. This does not
mean that inflation has no real effects. In particular, the steady state rate
of growth of the money stock affects the path of individual consumption, the
level of' welfare, and the income velocity of money.
Before studying the effects of' inflation, however, it must be

— 11 —

ascertained

that an inflationary path is consistent with the government's

budget constraint (14). I will assume that the government lets the money

stock grow at the rate m so that M/M1 = 1

-i.

m.

With the new money, the

government buys capital which it redistributes in lump sum fashion. These
lump sum redistributions affect none of the conditions used to derive (20).
So the amount of' capital held by the government can be arbitrarily set to some
constant.
I now compute the rate of' inflation which corresponds to a given rate of

growth of money. Equation (17) establishes that the steady state rate of'
inflation, ii,

is

given by:

in the steady state, neither C nor CT_i depend on T.

Therefore,

using

The

rate of'

(25)

inflation is equal to the rate of monetary expansion. Note that

the model is quite consistent with the rate of' return dominance of' capital
over money in the steady state. The rate of return of' the former is
[(l/p)

— 1], while that of the latter is —m.
By (24), the ratio of consumption on the date of financial transactions

to consumption in the f'ollowing period is: (l+m)/p; it rises as inflation

rises. Therefore, inflation distorts the intertemporal consumption decisions. It leads people to consume more right after they withdraw money and
less in later periods.5 The rate of deflation which is such that inter—
temporal consumption decisions are optimal from the point of view of' society

is

[(lip) —

1].

As Friedman (1969) proposed, the rate of' deflation must be

— 12 —

equal to the discount rate. This result was also obtained by Jovanovic (1982)
in a model in which money is held for transactions purposes but in which

people, while picking the timing of their visits to the financial intermedi-

aries optimally, do not pick their consumption path optimally. Here, it can
be shown as follows: consider a social planner who wants to maximize:

(28)

In the steady state in which pf'(K/C) isequal to one, consump—
sion is constant. Indeed, this is precisely what occurs in the decentralized

economy with money as long as, in (7) t+l't is equal to one. This in
turn requires that m be equal to [1 —

(l/p)]

as claimed.

However, there is a problem in sustaining the equilibrium with K = R when
m is equal to El —

(l/p)].

This problem arises because at this equilibrium

money and capital have the same rate of return. Therefore households would
prefer to withdraw money at the beginning of' their lives in the amount equal

to the present discounted value of their income. Then they would avoid all

— 13 -

visits

to their bank and associated transactions costs. This would result in

no capital being available in this model with 100% reserves. It may well be
the case that, with a smaller reserve requirement, the equilibrium would be

sustainable. In any event, note that, as long as m is just slightly bigger
than —[(lip) —

1],

the equilibrium of this model is essentially equal to the

Pareto optimum and does induce people to hold R units of' capital.

Inflation induces people to consume less in the period in whith they do

not go to the bank. Therefore, M/P1, which is equal to this consumption,
falls. However, surprisingly, in this model, M/P actually rises with inflation. This result is undoubtedly due in part to the fact that people do not
go to the bank more often when inflation rises. It emerges because even though

too much. The result can be established by noting
T T+l

that equation (18) says that M/P is proportional to consumption in the period
in which people visit the financial intermediary. By equation (19), this consumption does indeed rise with inflation.

THE NONNEUTRALITy OF MONETARY POLICY

V.

The main purpose of this paper is to study conditions outside the steady

state. First, it
(or

will be established that a wide variety of monetary policies

open market operations) affect aggregate output. This is the consensus

view of textbooks, such as Branson (1979). However,
been

challenged by a variety of'

authors

this view has recently

(e.g., Wallace

(1981),

O-am1ey and

Polemarchakis (1982)). These authors have shown that in models in which money

is

held only for its rate of return characteristics, open market operations

are neutral. Admittedly the premise of these models —— that money is not rate

of

return dominated by other assets —— appears to be a bad description of

— 14 -

free—market economies as we know them. The proof that open market operations

can affect output in the economy of this paper is straightforward. Consider a
base path for money and taxes: {M} and {T}, then an equilibrium sequence of

capital {K}

must satisfy (21). Consider any one of

these equilibria.

Now consider a slightly different financial policy for the government.
At

t, unexpectedly, the government purchases some extra capital by issuing

units of' money.

Then, at T, the government engages in the reverse transaction:

After

/ Pt}.

Then, it is clear from (21) that if, in the new equilibrium, capital remains

unchanged from {K} at t and t+1, it will have to be different from Kt+2 at
t+2; monetary policy affects output.

The intuition behind this result is as follows. Suppose the open market
operation has no effect on prices. Then, the paths of consumption will be
unaffected. However, the people who visit the bank at t will not want to
demand the increased amount of' money balances. If, instead, any rate of

inflation after t is affected by the open market operation, then by (7)

someone will change their consumption path. Finally, suppose that only the
price at t is affected by the government's change of financial policy. Then
the consumption of those who visited the bank at t—1, which is given by

Mt1/Pt will be affected. So the nonneutrality of' open market operations
hinges crucially on the fact that not everyone visits the bank on the day of

the operation. This is, in fact, a striking feature of the U.S. institutional
setup.

I am not just interested in establishing that monetary policy is non—

neutral. Instead, I want to characterize their effect.

I am unable to do so

— 15 —

for

general policies and general production functions. Instead, the rest of

this section is devoted to simulating various monetary policies under additional assumptions.

First, I will assume that the production function is Cobb—Douglas, and I

will normalize the aggregate labor endowment to be equal to one. Therefore:

=

K1

Moreover, I will assume that a =
of'

discount

(29)

0.25,

and that p

= 0.99.

This hii rate

is appropriate since people visit financial intermediaries often.

I pick as the relevant equilibrium the path which

converges

to R which,

in this case, is equal to 0.1553938. I consider in particular an expansion of
the money stock at time one from 100 to 119.9. The capital at time zero is
assumed to be R. Then, at time 11, the government is assumed to sell back all
the capital it bought in time period 2. In equilibrium, this involves
approximately a 20% fall in the money stock. Figure 1 shows the path of
capital for this experiment, while Figure 2 shows the path of real interest

rates. As these figures indicate, the effects are not negligible. Capital
increases almost 4% after the original open market purchase. This naturally
raises output. Moreover, this increase is accompanied by negative real rates
of interest. Note also that the monetary contraction of period 11 is
accompanied by a fall in capital that period, even though that contraction is

predicted oy agents as of period 1. The intuition behind these results is the
following. When the quantity of money is increased at 'r, the price level

rises. This decreases M 1/P and therefore reduced Cr1. This fall in the
consumption by those who do not visit their bank at -r, raises capital and

hence output in the following period. This explanation suggests that monetary
policy may derive much of its power in this model from the assumption that

— 16 —

not change their pattern of' bank

How much people who had not scheduled

a visit to their intermediary at -r would reduce their consumption in
response to inflation at T if' they were free to pick the timing of these

visits optimally, is an open question which deserves further research.
Unfortunately, the figures show that capital converges very slowly to
the steady state and that the negative root has important effects on the
dynamics of' the economy. For purposes of comparison, I also simulate the

effects from a once and for all expansion of money in period one to 119.9 from

100. This monetary expansion is then followed by the lump sum distribution of

the purchased capital. Figure 3 shows the resulting path for capital. What
is striking about this path is that the expansion of capital in the early

periods is almost identical to the expansion in Figure 2. Monetary policy
understood here as financial policy has about the same power as an expansion
in money which is unaccompanied by new government assets.
Before concluding this section, it is worth noting that if' the rate of'

-monetary expansion is changed unexpectedly once and for all at t, the path of'

capital is unaffected. Suppose that before t, M÷1/M was equal to (1+rn).
Then, before the change in rates of' monetary growth, (21) asserts that the

evolution of the capital stock was given by:

K
=

K
-r+3

Ef(

- p2ft(

K
)f'(

){f(—) - K

]

(29)

Now, suppose that at t, it is announced that from now on MT+l/MT will be given
by (1+m*). Then the evolution of capital from t+3 on is still given by (29),
and the original values of' Kt+i and Kt+2 are still equilibrium values of'
capital.

CONCLUSIONS

The model of this paper is a modest step towards the construction of'

tractable and realistic general equilibrium models capable of shedding light
on the effects of nonsteady—state monetary changes. Its major advantage is

that

people's motive for holding mpney is explicitly that money is used for

transactions. In particular, in those periods in which households do not

visit

their banks, they are faced with an extreme version of' the

"Clower

Constraint"; they must pay for their purchases with money carried over from

the previous period. This ensures that monetary policies which expand money
and prices, reduce the real consumption of those households which do not visit

are raised by this paper. First, an important

is to what extent the power of monetary policy would be diluted if

people timed their visits to intermediaries optimally. Associated with this
question is the question of whether people in fact do significantly alter the
interval during which they refrain from visiting their bank as events change.
The framework of this paper can also hopefully be used to study the

effects of various institutional setups on macroeconomic activity. In
particular, it should be capable of' shedding some light on the difference

between commodity standards, fractional reserve standards and the 100%

reserves standard of this paper.

1Primes denote first derivatives, while double primes denote second
derivatives.

2The analysis assumes that the holdings of money by household i from
t

to

t#l

are nonnegative. Here this is guaranteed by the fact that nega-.

tive holdings of money would induce negative consumption and hence utility

equal to minus infinity. However, it labor income were paid in the form of
money, the constraint that monetary holdings be nonnegative might become
binding.

3This condition requires that capital be held in positive amounts at

4For simplicity, ignore the transaction costs incurred by the govern-

ment when it engages in an open market operation.

5mis has been noted also by Jovanovic (1982). This effect is likely
to be even more pronounced on consumer expenditure when there are durable

goods, and consumer expenditure can be different from consumption. In this
paper, consumption and consumer expenditure coincide by assufnption.
