Aggregate Implications of Micro Asset Market Segmentation
Chris Edmond and Pierre-Olivier Weill
NBER Working Paper No. 15254
August 2009
JEL No. G12
ABSTRACT
This paper develops a consumption-based asset pricing model to explain and quantify the aggregate
implications of a frictional financial system, comprised of many financial markets partially integrated
with one-another. Each of our micro financial markets is inhabited by traders who are specialized in
that market's type of asset. We specify exogenously the level of segmentation that ultimately determines
how much idiosyncratic risk traders bear in their micro market and derive aggregate asset pricing implications.
We pick segmentation parameters to match facts about systematic and idiosyncratic return volatility.
We find that if the same level of segmentation prevails in every market, traders bear 20% of their idiosyncratic
risk. With otherwise standard parameters, this benchmark model delivers an unconditional equity premium
of 3.3% annual. We further disaggregate the model by allowing the level of segmentation to differ
across markets. This version of the model delivers the same aggregate asset pricing implications but
with only half the amount of segmentation: on average traders bear 10% of their idiosyncratic risk.

Introduction

Asset trade occurs in a wide range of security markets and is inhibited by a diverse array of frictions. Upfront transaction costs, asymmetric information between final asset
holders and financial intermediaries, and trade in over-the-counter or other decentralized markets that make locating counterparties difficult, all create “limits to arbitrage”
(Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). A considerable empirical and theoretical literature on market microstructure has studied these frictions and conclusively finds that “local” factors,
specific to the market under consideration, matter for asset prices in that market (see
Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin, 2001; Gabaix, Krishnamurthy, and Vigneron,
2007, for example). But these market-specific analyses do not give a clear sense of
whether micro frictions and local factors matter in the aggregate. Indeed, by focusing
exclusively on market-specific determinants of asset prices, these analyses are somewhat disconnected from traditional frictionless consumption-based asset pricing models
of Lucas (1978), Breeden (1979) and Mehra and Prescott (1985). Research in that tradition, of course, takes the opposite view that micro asset market frictions and local
factors do not matter in the aggregate and that asset prices are determined by broad
macroeconomic factors. The truth presumably lies somewhere between these two extremes: asset prices reflect both macro and micro-market specific factors (Cochrane,
2005).
This paper constructs a simple consumption-based asset pricing model in order
to explain and quantify the macro impacts of micro market-specific factors. At the
heart of our paper is a stylized model of a financial system comprised of a collection
of many small micro financial markets that are partially integrated with one another.
We strip this model of a fragmented financial system down to a few essential features
and borrow some modeling tricks from Lucas (1990) and others to build a tractable
aggregate model. In short, we take a deliberately macro approach: we do not address
any particular features of any specific asset class but we are able to spell out precisely
the aggregate implications of fragmentation and limits-to-arbitrage frictions.
In our benchmark model, there are many micro asset markets. Each market is
inhabited by traders specialized in trading a single type of durable risky asset with
supply normalized to one. Of course, if the risky assets could be frictionlessly traded
across markets all idiosyncratic market-specific risk would be diversified away and each
asset trader would be exposed only to aggregate risk. We prevent this full risk sharing
by imposing, exogenously, the following pattern of market-specific frictions: we assume
that for each market m an exogenous fraction λm of the expense of purchasing assets

1

in that market must be borne by traders specialized in that market. In return, these
traders receive λm of the benefit, i.e., of the dividends and resale price of assets sold in
that market. We show that, in equilibrium, the parameter λm measures the amount of
non-tradeable idiosyncratic risk: when λm = 0 all idiosyncratic risk can be traded and
traders are fully diversified. When λm = 1 traders cannot trade away their idiosyncratic
risk and simply consume the dividends thrown off by the asset in their specific market.
Our theoretical market setup is made tractable by following Lucas (1990) in assuming that investors can pool the tradeable idiosyncratic risk within a large family. In
equilibrium, the “state price” of a unit of consumption in each market m is a weighted
average of the marginal utility of consumption in that market (with weight λm ) and
a term that reflects the cross-sectional average marginal utility of consumption (with
weight 1 − λm ). Generally, both the average level of λm and its cross-sectional variation across markets play crucial roles in determining the equilibrium mapping from the
state of the economy, as represented by the realized exogenous distribution of dividends
across markets, to the endogenous distribution of asset prices across markets. In the
special case where λm = 0 for all markets m, then the state price of consumption is
equal across markets and equal to the marginal utility of the aggregate endowment
so that this economy collapses to the standard Lucas (1978) consumption-based asset
pricing model. The specification of λm , representing the array of micro frictions which
impede trade in claims to assets across markers, constitutes our one new degree of
freedom relative to a standard consumption-based asset pricing model.
We start by calibrating a special case of the general model where λm = λ for all
markets. We choose standard parameters for aggregates and preferences: independently
and identically distributed (IID) lognormal aggregate endowment growth, time- and
state-separable expected utility preferences with constant relative risk aversion γ = 4.
We then use the parameters governing the distribution of individual endowments and
the single λ to simultaneously match the systematic return volatility of a well-diversified
market portfolio and key time-series properties of an individual stock’s total return
volatility (see Goyal and Santa-Clara, 2003; Bali, Cakici, Yan, and Zhang, 2005). This
procedure yields segmentation of approximately λ = 0.20. We find that this model
generates a sizable unconditional equity premium, some 3.3% annual. However, as
is familiar from many asset pricing models with expected utility preferences and trend
growth, the model has a risk free rate that is too high and too volatile. Next, we extend
this benchmark model by allowing for multiple types of market segmentation λm , which
generates cross-sectional differences in stock return volatilities. This motivates us to
pick values for λm in order to match the volatilities of portfolios sorted on measures of
2

idiosyncratic volatility, as documented by Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006). Our
main finding is that aggregation matters: with cross-sectional variation in λm , we need
an average amount of segmentation of approximately λ̄ = 0.10 to hit our targets, only
half that of the single λ model. Moreover, this version of the model delivers essentially
the same aggregate asset pricing implications as the single λ benchmark despite having
only about half the average amount of segmentation. The characteristics of the micro
markets in this disaggregate economy are quite distinct: some 50% of the aggregate
market by value has a λm of zero, with the amount of segmentation rising to a maximum
of about λm = 0.33 for about 2% of the aggregate market by value.
Market frictions in the asset pricing literature. Traditionally, macroeconomists
have taken the view that frictions in financial intermediation or other asset trades are
small enough to be neglected in the analysis: asset prices are set “as if” there were no
intermediaries but instead a grand Walrasian auction directly between consumers. In
particular, early contributions to the literature, such as Rubinstein (1976), Lucas (1978)
and Breeden (1979), characterize equilibrium asset prices using frictionless models. The
quantitative limitations of plausibly calibrated traditional asset pricing models were
highlighted by the “equity premium” and “risk-free rate” puzzles of Mehra and Prescott
(1985), Weil (1989) and others.
Since then an extensive literature has attempted to explicitly incorporate one or
other market frictions into an asset pricing model in an attempt to rationalize these
and related asset pricing puzzles.1 Models introducing market frictions have tended
to follow one of two approaches. On the one hand, part of the the financial economics literature followed deliberately micro-market approaches, focusing on the impact of specific frictions in specific financial markets. This microfoundations approach
is transparent and leads to precise implications but does not lead to any clear sense of
whether or why micro asset market frictions matter in the aggregate. Moreover, these
models are typically not well integrated with the standard Lucas (1978) consumptionbased asset pricing framework. On the other hand, other papers have looked at
unabashedly aggregate approaches, with some financial friction faced by some representative intermediary (see, e.g., Aiyagari and Gertler, 1999; Kyle and Xiong, 2001;
Vayanos, 2005; He and Krishnamurthy, 2008a,b) or by households (see, among many
1

See for example Aiyagari and Gertler (1991), He and Modest (1995) and Luttmer (1996, 1999) for
the quantitative evaluation of asset pricing models with trading frictions. Other attempts to rationalize
asset pricing puzzles retain frictionless markets but depart from traditional models by using novel
preference specifications (e.g., Epstein and Zin (1989), Weil (1989, 1990), Campbell and Cochrane
(1999)) and/or novel shock processes (e.g., Bansal and Yaron (2004)).

others Heaton and Lucas, 1996; Chien, Cole, and Lustig, 2008; Pavlova and Rigobon,
2008). The friction “stands in” for a diverse array of real-world micro frictions on
the intermediary and households’ side. Since there are large discrepancies between the
predictions of frictionless asset pricing models and the data, in the calibration of this
kind of macro model the friction also tends to have to be large. This approach has
the advantage that the friction has macro implications, by construction, but has the
disadvantage that the friction has no transparent interpretation. In particular, it is
difficult to evaluate the plausibility of the calibrated friction in terms of the constraints
facing real-world households and firms.
In these macro models, financial intermediaries often bear disproportionate amounts
of aggregate risk, but this implication is inconsistent with the empirical literature on
market segmentation, which emphasizes instead that intermediaries bear disproportionate amounts of “local” or idiosyncratic risk. Our approach takes a middle course.
Starting from a model that is consistent with intermediaries bearing too much local
risk, we work out the aggregation problem. With the aggregation problem solved,
we can then embed our stylized model of a collection of micro-markets that together
form a financial system into an otherwise standard asset-pricing model and examine its
quantitative implications.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present our
model and show how to compute equilibrium asset prices. In Section 3 we calibrate a
special case of the model with a single type of market segmentation and in Section 4 we
show that this model can generate a sizable equity premium. Section 5 then extends
this benchmark model by allowing for multiple types of market segmentation and a
non-degenerate cross-section of volatilities. Technical details and several extensions are
given in the Appendix.

Model

The model is a variant on the pure endowment asset pricing models of Lucas (1978),
Breeden (1979) and Mehra and Prescott (1985).

2.1

Setup

Market structure and endowments. Time is discrete and denoted t ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...}.
There are many distinct micro asset markets indexed by m ∈ [0, 1]. Each market
m is specialized in trading a single type of durable asset with supply normalized to

4

Sm = 1. Each period the asset produces a stochastic realization of a non-storable
dividend ym > 0. The aggregate endowment available to the entire economy is:
y :=

Z

1

ym Sm dm =

0

Z

1

ym dm.

0

The aggregate endowment y > 0 follows an exogenous stochastic process. Conditional
on the aggregate state, the endowments ym are independently and identically distributed
(IID) across markets.
Preferences. We follow Lucas (1990) and use a representative family construct to
provide consumption insurance beyond our market-segmentation frictions. The single
representative family consists of many, identical, traders who are specialized in particular asset markets. The period utility for the family views the utility of each type of
trader as perfectly substitutable:
U(c) :=

Z

1

u(cm ) dm,

0

where u : R+ → R is a standard increasing concave utility function. Only in the special
case of risk neutrality does the family view the consumption of each type of trader
as being perfect substitutes. In general risk aversion will lead the family to smooth
consumption across traders in different markets. Intertemporal utility for the family
P
t
has the standard time- and state-separable form, E0 [ ∞
t=0 β U(ct )], with constant time
discount factor 0 < β < 1. The crucial role of the representative family is to eliminate
the wealth distribution across markets as an additional endogenous state variable (see,
e.g., Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe, 2002).
Segmentation frictions. We interpret the representative family as a partially integrated financial system. Each trader in market m works at a specialized trading desk
that deals in the asset specific to that market (Figure 1 illustrates). Traders in market
m are assumed to bear an exogenous fraction 0 ≤ λm ≤ 1 of the expense of trading
in that market and in return receive λm of the benefit. The remaining 1 − λm of the
expense and benefit of trading in that market is shared between family members.
More precisely, given segmentation parameter λm , the period budget constraint
facing a representative trader in market m is:
cm + λm pm s′m + (1 − λm )T ′ ≤ λm (pm + ym )sm + (1 − λm )T,
5

(1)

where pm is the ex-dividend price of a share in the asset in market m, and sm , s′m
represent share holdings in that asset.
As can be seen from the budget constraint, a trader in market m holds directly
a number λm s′m of shares of asset m. The collection of remaining shares, (1 − λn )s′n

for all n ∈ [0, 1], is collectively held by all family members in what we call the family
portfolio. The expense and benefit of trading this family portfolio is divided among
family members in a manner summarized by the two terms (1 − λm )T ′ and (1 − λm )T
in the budget constraint, (1). Specifically, the term (1 − λm )T ′ on the left-hand side
means that the trader in market m is asked to contribute 1 − λm of the expense of
acquiring the family portfolio. Symmetrically, the term (1 − λm )T on the right-hand
side means that the trader receives 1 − λm of the benefit. Thus, a balanced family
budget requires that:

(1 − λm )T dm =

(1 − λn )pn s′n dm.

In words, the total value of all family members’ contributions to the family portfolio
(the left-hand-side) has to equal the total asset value of the family portfolio (the rightR1
hand-side). Defining λ̄ := 0 λm dm we can rewrite this identity as:

Similarly, 0 (1 − λm )T dm is equal to the cum-dividend value of the remaining shares
brought into the period. This yields:

accounting identities for the family portfolio in (2) and (3). The expectation on the
right-hand-side of the Bellman equation is formed using the conditional information
summarized by some state variable x (to be defined precisely later in the context of the
calibration).
An equilibrium of this economy is a collection of functions {p, c, s′} such that (i)
taking p : [0, 1] → R+ as given, c : [0, 1] → R+ and s′ : [0, 1] → R solve the family’s
optimization problem (4), and (ii) asset markets clear: s′m = 1 for all m.

Equilibrium allocation. Before solving for asset prices, we provide the equilibrium
allocation of consumption across markets. Substituting the accounting identities (2)
and (3) into the budget constraint (1) and imposing the equilibrium condition s′m = 1,
we obtain:
cm = λm ym + (1 − λm )

Z

0

1

1 − λn

1 − λ̄

And since the realized idiosyncratic yn are independent of λn , an application of the law
of large numbers gives:
cm = λm ym + (1 − λm )y.
(5)

7

This formula is intuitive: equilibrium consumption in market m is a weighted average
of the idiosyncratic and aggregate endowments with weights reflecting the degree of
market segmentation. The λm represent the extent to which traders are not fully
diversified and hence the segmentation parameters determine the degree of risk sharing
in the economy. If λm = 0, traders are fully diversified and will have consumption equal
to the aggregate endowment cm = y (i.e., full consumption insurance). But if λm = 1,
traders are not at all diversified and will simply consume the dividends realized in their
specific market cm = ym (i.e., autarky).
Asset prices. To obtain asset prices, we use the first-order condition of the family’s
optimization problem. Let µm ≥ 0 denote the Lagrange multiplier on the family’s

budget constraint for market m. We show in Appendix A that the family’s Lagrangian
can be written:

Z 1
′
L =
u(cm ) + qm (pm + ym )sm − qm pm sm − µm cm dm + βE[v(s′ , y ′, x′ )|x],

where
qm := λm µm + (1 − λm )

1 − λn
µn dn,

(6)

is a weighted average of the Lagrange multipliers in market m and the multipliers for
other markets with weights reflecting the various degrees of market segmentation. More
specifically, qm is the marginal value to the family of earning one (real) dollar in market
m. The first term in (6) arises because a fraction λm goes to the local trader, with
marginal utility µm . The second term arises because the remaining fraction is shared
among other family members, with marginal utility µn , according to their relative
contributions (1 − λn )/(1 − λ̄) to the family portfolio. We will refer to qm as the state
price of earning one real dollar in market m.
Just as equilibrium consumption in market m is a weighted average of the idiosyncratic or “local” endowment and aggregate endowment with weights λm and 1 − λm , so
too the state price for market m is a weighted average of the idiosyncratic multiplier
and an aggregate multiplier with the same weights. To highlight this, define:
q :=

Z

0

1

1 − λn
µn dn,
1 − λ̄

(7)

so that we can write qm = λm µm + (1 − λm )q. If any particular market m has λm = 0
then the state price in that market is equal to the aggregate state price qm = q and
is independent of the local endowment realization. If the segmentation parameter is
8

common across markets, λm = λ all m, then q is the cross-sectional average marginal
R1
utility and q = 0 qm dm. More generally, q is not a simple average over µm since
different markets have different relative contributions (1 − λm )/(1 − λ̄) to the family
portfolio.
The first order conditions of the family’s problem are straightforward. For each cm
we have:
u′(cm ) = µm .

(8)

And for each s′m we have:



∂v ′ ′ ′
qm pm = βE
(s , y , x ) x .
∂s′m

(9)

The Envelope Theorem then gives:
∂v
(s, y, x) = qm (pm + ym ).
∂sm

(10)

Combining equations (9) and (10) gives the Euler equation characterizing asset prices
in each market:
 ′

qm ′
′
pm = E β (pm + ym ) x .
(11)
qm
The Euler equation for asset prices takes a standard form, familiar from Lucas (1978),
′
with the crucial distinction being that the stochastic discount factor (SDF), βqm
/qm ,
is market specific.
Note that, combining the formulas for equilibrium consumption, (5), market-specific
state prices, (6), and the pricing equation (11), we obtain a mapping from the primitives
of the economy (the λm , ym etc) into equilibrium asset prices. In particular, it’s easy to
verify that the Lucas (1978) asset prices are obtained in the further special case λm = 0
R1
all m, so that cm = y all m and µm = u′ (y) all m and q = 0 u′ (y) dn = u′(y).
Shadow prices of risk-free bonds. To simplify the presentation of the model, we
have not explicitly introduced risk-free assets. But we can still compute “shadow” bond
prices. Let πk denote the price of a zero-coupon bond pays one unit of the consumption
good for sure in k ≥ 1 period’s time and that is held in the family portfolio. As shown
in Appendix A these bonds would have price:

q′ ′
πk = E β πk−1 x ,
q


9

(12)

with π0 := 1. Bonds are priced using the aggregate state price q. In particular,
the one-period shadow gross risk-free rate is given by 1/π1 = 1/E [βq ′/q]. Although
the one-period SDF for bonds βq ′ /q does not depend on any particular idiosyncratic
endowment realization, it does depend on the distribution of idiosyncratic endowments
and in general is not simply the Lucas (1978)-Breeden (1979) SDF.

3

Calibration

To evaluate the significance of these segmentation frictions, we calibrate the model.

3.1

Parameterization of the model

Preferences and endowments. Let period utility u(c) be CRRA with coefficient
γ > 0 so that u′ (c) = c−γ . The log aggregate endowment is a random walk with drift
and IID normal innovations:
2
ǫg,t+1 ∼ IID and N(0, σǫg
),

log gt+1 := log(yt+1 /yt ) = log ḡ + ǫg,t+1 ,

ḡ > 0.

(13)

Log market-specific endowments are the log aggregate endowment plus an idiosyncratic
term:
log ym,t := log yt + log ŷm,t ,

(14)

so that market-specific endowments inherit the trend in the aggregate endowment. The
log idiosyncratic endowment log ŷm,t is conditionally IID normal in the cross-section:
log ŷm,t ∼ IID and N(−σt2 /2, σt2 ),

(15)

where the mean of −σt2 /2 is chosen to normalize Et [ŷm,t ] = 1 and Et [ym,t ] = yt .
Idiosyncratic endowment volatility. Volatility of the idiosyncratic endowment in
a given market is time-varying and given by an AR(1) process in logs:
log σt+1 = (1 − φ) log σ̄ + φ log σt + ǫv,t+1 ,

2
ǫv,t+1 ∼ IID and N(0, σǫv
),

σ̄ > 0. (16)

In a frictionless model (λm = 0 all m), all idiosyncratic risk would be diversified away
so that asset prices would be independent of σt . With segmentation frictions (λm > 0),
by contrast, both the level and dynamics of σt will affect asset prices.

10

Solving the quantitative model. Since ŷm,t = ym,t /yt we can use equation (5) to
write equilibrium consumption in market m as the product of the aggregate endowment yt and an idiosyncratic component that depends only on the local idiosyncratic
endowment realization ŷm,t and the amount of segmentation:
cm,t = [1 + λm (ŷm,t − 1)]yt .

(17)

Similarly, we can then use this expression for consumption and the fact that utility is
CRRA to write the local state price as:
qm,t = θm,t yt−γ ,

(18)

where:
−γ

θm,t := λm [1 + λm (ŷm,t − 1)]

+ (1 − λm )

Z

1 − λn
[1 + λn (ŷn,t − 1)]−γ dn.

(19)

The SDF for market m is then:

Mm,t+1 := βgt+1

θm,t+1
.
θm,t

(20)

−γ
This is the usual Lucas (1978)-Breeden (1979) aggregate SDF Mt+1 := βgt+1
with a
market-specific multiplicative “twisting” factor M̂m,t+1 := θm,t+1 /θm,t that adjusts the
SDF to account for idiosyncratic endowment risk.

To solve the model in stationary variables, let p̂m,t := pm,t /yt denote the price-toaggregate-dividend ratio for market m. Dividing both sides of equation (11) by yt > 0
and using gt+1 := yt+1 /yt this ratio solves the Euler equation:
p̂m,t = Et

1−γ θm,t+1

(21)

which is the standard CRRA-formula except for the multiplicative adjustment θm,t+1 /θm,t .
This is a linear integral equation to be solved for the unknown function mapping the
state into the price/dividend ratio. In general this integral equation cannot be solved
in closed form, but numerical solutions can be obtained in a straightforward manner
along the lines of Tauchen and Hussey (1991). We discuss these methods in greater
detail in Appendix B below.

3.2

Calibration strategy and results

We calibrate the model using monthly postwar data (1959:1-2007:12, unless otherwise
noted). Following a long tradition in the consumption-based asset pricing literature, we
interpret the aggregate endowment as per capita real personal consumption expenditure
on nondurables and services. We set log ḡ = (1.02)1/12 to match an annual 2% growth
√
rate and σǫg = 0.01/ 12 to match an annual 1% standard deviation over the postwar
sample. We set β = (0.99)1/12 to reflect an annual pure rate of time preference of 1%
and we set the coefficient of relative risk aversion to γ = 4.
For our benchmark calibration we assume that all markets in the economy share
the same segmentation parameter, λ. Given the values for preference parameters β, γ
and the aggregate endowment growth process ḡ, σǫg above, we still need to assign values
to this single λ and the three parameters of the cross-sectional endowment volatility
process σ̄, φ, σǫv .
Calibrating the idiosyncratic volatility process. The crucial consequence of
market segmentation is that local traders are forced to bear some idiosyncratic risk.
Thus, to explain the impact of market segmentation on risk premia, it is important
that our model generates realistic levels of idiosyncratic risk. This leads us to choose
the parameters of the stochastic process for idiosyncratic endowment volatility in order
to match key features of the volatility of a typical stock return. To see why there is a
natural mapping between the two volatilities, write the gross returns on stock m as:
Rm,t = gt

ŷm,t + p̂m,t
.
p̂m,t−1

(22)

Thus, the volatility of ŷm,t directly affects stock returns through the dividend term of
the numerator. It also indirectly affects stock returns through the asset price, p̂m,t .
We obtain key statistics about stock return volatility from Goyal and Santa-Clara
(2003). Their measure of monthly stock volatility is obtained by adding up the crosssectional stock return dispersion over each day of the previous month. In Figure 2 we
show the monthly time series (1963:1-2001:12) of their measure of the cross-sectional
standard deviation of stock returns, as updated by Bali, Cakici, Yan, and Zhang (2005).
We choose the idiosyncratic endowment volatility process so that, when we calculate
the same stock return volatility measure in our model, we replicate three key features
of this data: the unconditional average return volatility of 16.4% monthly, the unconditional standard deviation of return volatility 4.17% monthly, and AR(1) coefficient
of return volatility 0.84 monthly. We replicate these three features by simultaneously

Data from

choosing the three parameters governing the stochastic process for endowment volatility: the unconditional average σ̄, the innovation standard deviation σǫv , and the AR(1)
coefficient φ.
Calibrating the segmentation parameter. The segmentation parameter λ governs the extent to which local traders can diversify away the return volatility of their
local asset. Thus, λ determines the extent to which the idiosyncratic volatility factor,
σt , has an impact on asset prices and creates systematic variation in asset returns. This
leads us to identify λ using a measure of systematic volatility, specifically the 4.16%
monthly standard deviation of the real value-weighted return of NYSE stocks from
CRSP.
To understand precisely how the identification works, recall first what would happen in the absence of market segmentation, λ = 0. Then, we would be back in the
Lucas (1978)-Mehra and Prescott (1985) model with IID lognormal aggregate endowment growth. As is well known (see, e.g., LeRoy, 2006), this model can’t generate
realistic amounts of systematic volatility. Specifically, with λ = 0 the return from a diversified market portfolio is gt (1+p̄)/p̄ where p̄ = βE[g 1−γ ]/(1−βE[g 1−γ ]) is the constant
price/dividend ratio for the aggregate market. With our standard parameterization of
13

the preference parameters and aggregate endowment growth, (1 + p̄)/p̄ ≈ 1.0058 so that

the monthly standard deviation of the diversified market portfolio return is approximately the same as the monthly standard deviation of aggregate endowment growth,
about 0.29% monthly as opposed to about 4.3% monthly in the data.
In contrast with the λ = 0 case, when λ > 0 idiosyncratic endowment volatility
creates systematic volatility. Indeed, because of persistence, a high idiosyncratic endowment volatility this month predicts a high idiosyncratic endowment volatility next
month. Thus in every market m local traders expect to bear more idiosyncratic risk,
and because of risk aversion the price dividend ratio p̂m,t has to go down everywhere.
Because this effect impacts all stocks at the same time, it endogenously creates systematic return volatility. Clearly, the effect is larger if markets are more segmented and
traders are forced to bear more idiosyncratic risk: thus, a larger λ will result in a larger
increase in systematic volatility.
Calibration results. The calibrated parameters are listed in Table 1. In our benchmark calibration, the level of λ is 0.20. That is, 20% of idiosyncratic endowment risk is
non-tradeable. In terms of portfolio weights, we also find that λ = 0.20 implies that, in
a typical market m, a trader invests approximately 20% of his wealth in the local asset,
and the rest in the family portfolio.2 Table 2 shows that with these parameters, the
benchmark model matches the target moments closely but not exactly. Notice that in
the benchmark calibration the persistence of the cross-sectional endowment distribution
φ is approximately one.3 That is, to match the persistence in the data, the calibration
procedure tries to select a very high φ. As explained above, persistence is necessary for
idiosyncratic volatility to matter for systematic stock return volatility. Thus, the value
of φ is high largely because the model is matching a high level of systematic volatility.

Quantitative examples

Aggregate statistics. In comparing our model to data, we adopt the perspective
of an econometrician who observes a collection of asset returns but who ignores the
possibility of market segmentation. In particular, to make our results comparable to
those typically reported in the empirical asset pricing literature, we focus on the properties of the aggregate market portfolio. We define the gross market return RM :=

The derivation of portfolio weights for the family is given in Appendix A below.
The discrete-state approximation of the process for σt (equation 16) used to solve the model is
stationary by construction, even when φ = 1 exactly. See Appendix B for more details on our solution
method.

pm dm is the ex-dividend value of the market portfolio and

y is the aggregate endowment. We define the shadow gross one period risk free rate
by Rf := E[βq ′ /q]−1 where q is the aggregate state price that determines the price of
risk free bonds, as in (12). Implicitly, bonds are priced as if they trade in their own
frictionless “λ = 0” market, but the pricing of such bonds takes into account λ > 0 in
other asset markets.4
We then calculate the unconditional equity risk premium E[RM − Rf ] and similarly
for other statistics. We call p/y the price dividend ratio of the market.

4.1

Results

Equity premium. With these definitions in mind, Table 3 shows our model’s implications for aggregate returns and price/dividend ratios. We report annualized monthly
statistics from the model and compare these to annualized monthly returns and to
annual price/dividend ratios (we use annual data for price/dividends because of the
pronounced seasonality in dividends at the monthly frequency). The benchmark model
produces an annual equity risk premium of 3.3% annual as opposed to about 5.4% annual in the postwar NYSE CRSP data. Clearly this is a much larger equity premium
than is produced by a standard Lucas (1978)-Mehra and Prescott (1985) model. For
comparison, that model with risk aversion γ = 4 and IID consumption growth with
annual standard deviation of 1% produces an annual equity premium of about 0.04%.
The segmented markets model with λ = 0.20 is able to generate an equity premium
some two orders of magnitude larger.
Why is there a large equity premium? Relative to standard consumption-based
asset pricing models with time-separable expected utility preferences, our model delivers
a large equity premium. Is it a direct consequence our strategy of picking λ in order
to match systematic return volatility? No, since model risk premia are generated by
covariances: no matter how much return volatility you feed into a model, the equity
risk premia will be zero if the model’s SDF is not negatively correlated with that return
variations (see Cochrane and Hansen, 1992, for a forceful argument).
What, then, is the equity premium from the point of view of aggregate consumption?
One can show that, in our model, if one computes the unconditional average equity
′
An alternative approach would be to define a market-specific risk free rate Rf,m := E[βqm
/qm ]−1
R1
for market m and then an average risk free rate by Rf := 0 Rf,m dm. In this interpretation, Rf,m is
a measure of the local real risk free opportunity cost of funds in market m. In our benchmark with
λm = λ for all m, both approaches give the same average risk free rate Rf .

−γ
SDF βgt+1
instead of the true model SDF, then the equity premium is on the order of
0.04% (4 basis points) annual rather than the 3.3% annual in the benchmark model.
While aggregate consumption does not command a big risk premium, the volatility

factor does. To see this, consider the premium implied by the SDF βqt+1 /qt where q is
aggregate state price that determines the (shadow) price of risk free bonds. In general
R1
this is given by equation (7) but with a single common λ it reduces to q = 0 µm dm =
R 1 −γ
c dm, the cross-section average marginal utility. In our benchmark model, this
0 m
SDF implies an equity premium of 2.17% annual. This comes from the convexity of
the marginal utility function: a high realization of σt makes equilibrium consumption
highly dispersed across markets so that average marginal utilities are high. At the same
time, a high σt depresses asset prices in every market, so that the return on the market
portfolio is low.
Level of the risk-free rate. Although the benchmark model delivers reasonable
implications for the level of the equity premium, it is not so successful on other dimensions. The level of the risk free rate is very high as compared to the data. In the
model the risk free rate is about 8% annual, while in the data it is more like 2%. As
emphasized by Weil (1989), this is a common problem for models with expected-utility
preferences. In short, attempts to address the equity premium puzzle by increasing risk
aversion also tend to raise the risk free rate so that even if it’s possible to match the
equity premium, the model may well do so at absolute levels of returns that are too
high. This effect comes from the relationship between real interest rates and growth in a
deterministic setting with expected utility: high risk aversion means low intertemporal
elasticity of substitution so that it takes high real interest rates to compensate for high
aggregate growth. With risk, there is an offsetting precautionary savings effect that
could, in principle, pull the risk free rate back down to more realistic levels. But in our
calibration this precautionary savings effect is quantitatively small: raising λ from zero
(the Mehra and Prescott case) to λ = 0.20 (our benchmark) lowers the risk free rate
by about 1% annual.
Volatility of the risk-free rate. In the data, the risk free rate is smooth and the
volatility of the equity premium reflects the volatility of equity returns. In the benchmark model, the risk free rate is too volatile, about 3% annual as opposed to 1% annual
in the data.

Yield curve. With IID lognormal aggregate growth and CRRA utility, the average
yield curve in a standard asset pricing model is flat. By contrast, our model generates
an increasing and concave average yield curve, as shown in Figure 3. This shape comes
from the relationship between the aggregate state price q and aggregate volatility σ.
Since σ has positive serial correlation but is not a random walk, its first difference is
negatively serially correlated. This negative serial correlation is inherited by the oneperiod bond pricing SDF βq ′ /q, and, as is well known, this has desirable qualitative
bond pricing implications (see Backus and Zin, 1994, for example).

risk free rate is so volatile and because log(·) is concave, this yield turns out 1% lower than the average risk free rate
reported in Table 3.

Price/dividend ratio. The benchmark model produces an annual price/dividend
ratio of about 12 as opposed to an unconditional average of more like 31 in the NYSE
CRSP data. Given the large, persistent, swings in the price/dividend ratio in the data,
what constitutes success on this dimension is not entirely clear. The model generates
if anything slightly too much unconditional volatility in the log price/dividend ratio,
some 44% annual as opposed to 34% in the data. This is another reflection of the fact
that the model by construction matches the aggregate volatility of the market. While
the unconditional volatility of the price/dividend ratio is similar in the model and in the
data, the temporal composition of this volatility is somewhat different. In particular,
the persistence of the log price/dividend ratio is about 0.50 annual in the benchmark
model, lower than the 0.89 in the data. That is, the unconditional volatility of the
price/dividend ratio in the data comes from large, low-frequency movements whereas
17

the unconditional volatility in the model comes from higher-frequency movements.

Discussion

Constant endowment volatility. Our benchmark model has two departures from
a standard consumption-based asset pricing model: segmentation and a time-varying
endowment volatility. To show that both these departures are essential for our results,
we solved our model with constant endowment volatility, i.e., σt = σ for all t. For
this exercise, we fix the volatility at the same level as the unconditional average from
the benchmark model σ̄ = 1.71 and keep the level of segmentation at the benchmark
λ = 0.20. In Table 2 we show that this “constant σ” version of the model produces
essentially the same amount of unconditional cross-sectional stock return volatility as
in the data (suggesting that this moment is principally determined by σ̄ alone) but
produces only as much systematic stock volatility as would a benchmark Lucas (1978)Mehra and Prescott (1985) model, about 0.3% monthly as opposed to 4.3% in the
data. Thus λ > 0 is necessary but not sufficient for our model to create systematic
stock volatility from idiosyncratic endowment volatility. In Table 3 we see that despite
producing negligible systematic stock volatility, the model with constant σ is capable of
generating a modest equity premium, some 1.2% annual. The benchmark model with
time variation in endowment volatility generates another 2.1% on top of this for a total
of 3.3% annual.
Countercyclical endowment volatility. Many measures of cross-sectional idiosyncratic risk increase in recessions (see, for example Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu,
2001; Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron, 2004). This counter-cyclicality is also a feature
of the cross-sectional standard deviation of returns data from Goyal and Santa-Clara
(2003). However, the stochastic process we use for the cross-sectional volatility evolves
independently of aggregate growth. To see if our results are sensitive to this, we modify
the stochastic process in (16) to:
log σt+1 = (1 − φ) log σ̄ + φ log σt − η(log gt − log ḡ) + ǫv,t+1 .

(23)

with ǫv,t+1 IID normal, as before. If η > 0, then aggregate growth below trend in period
t increases the likelihood that volatility is above trend in period t + 1 so that volatility
is counter-cyclical. We identify the new parameter η by requiring that, in a monthly
regression of the cross-section standard deviation of stock returns on lagged aggregate
growth, the regression coefficient is −0.5 as it is in the data. The calibrated parameters
18

for this “feedback” version of the model are also shown in Table 1. The calibrated
η elasticity is 1.96 so aggregate growth 1% below trend tends to increase endowment
volatility by nearly 2%. The other calibrated parameters are indistinguishable from the
benchmark parameters. Moreover, the model’s implications for asset prices as shown in
Table 3 are also very close to the results for the benchmark model. This suggests that
while the model can be reconciled with the countercyclical behavior of cross-sectional
stock volatility, this feature is not necessary for our main results.
Relationship to incomplete markets models. There is a large literature in macroeconomics that analyzes the asset pricing implications of market incompleteness when
households receive uninsurable idiosyncratic income shocks.5 One might have the impression that all our model does is shift the focus of incomplete markets models from the
idiosyncratic labor income risk facing households to the idiosyncratic income risk faced
by the financial sector. We now argue that, while our segmented markets model indeed results in uninsurable shocks, it is conceptually different from standard incomplete
markets models.
To see why, note that in standard incomplete markets models the intertemporal
marginal rate of substitution (IMRS) of every household i prices the excess return of
the market portfolio:
E [Mi Re ] = 0.

(24)

As forcefully emphasized by Mankiw (1986), Constantinides and Duffie (1996) and
Kruger and Lustig (2008), with CRRA utility when idiosyncratic consumption growth
is statistically independent from aggregate consumption growth, idiosyncratic risk has
no impact on the equity premium. Indeed, in that case the IMRS can be factored
into M̂i M, where M = βg −γ is the standard Lucas (1978)-Breeden (1979) stochastic
discount factor, and M̂i is an idiosyncratic component that is independent from M.
Expanding the expectation in (24) we have:
E[M̂i MRe ] = E[M̂i ]E[MRe ] + Cov[M̂i , MRe ] = 0.
From independence Cov[M̂i , MRe ] = 0. Using this and dividing both sides by E[M̂i ] > 0
we obtain:
E [MRe ] = 0.
As shown by Kocherlakota (1996), this asset pricing equation cannot rationalize the
observed equity premium.
5

See Telmer (1993) and Heaton and Lucas (1996) for important early examples.

19

In our benchmark model we maintain the assumption that the idiosyncratic component of dividends, ŷm , is statistically independent from aggregate consumption growth.
Despite this, we obtain a much larger equity premium than Mehra and Prescott. The
reason is that in our asset pricing model the local stochastic discount factor does not
have to price the excess return on the aggregate market portfolio, as in equation (24),
but instead price the excess return on the local asset market. The local discount factor
is correlated with the local excess return (through the local endowment realization) and
this makes it impossible to strip-out the influence of the market-specific factor.
Specifically, instead of equation (24) we have a pricing equation of the form:
e
E [Mm Rm
] = 0,

(25)

e
where Mm is the local stochastic discount factor and Rm
is the local excess return. From

equation (20) we can factor the local discount factor into M̂m M where M is again the
Lucas (1978)-Breeden (1979) discount factor and M̂m is a market-specific factor. Now
proceeding as above and expanding the expectation in (25) we have:
e
e
e
E[M̂m MRm
] = E[M̂m ]E[MRm
] + Cov[M̂m , MRm
] = 0.
e
e
But M̂m and Rm
depend on the same local risk factor so Cov[M̂m , MRm
] 6= 0 and we
cannot factor out E[M̂m ]. Because this makes it impossible to aggregate the collection
of equations (25) into (24), in our model the standard incomplete markets logic does

not apply.

Cross-sectional volatilities

In our first set of quantitative examples we used a common amount of segmentation,
λ, for all asset markets. This implies that conditional on the aggregate state of the
economy, each market m is characterized by a common amount of volatility (essentially
determined by the economy-wide σt and λ) so that there is no cross-sectional variation
in volatility. We now pursue the implications of the general model with market-specific
λm and hence a non-degenerate cross-section of volatility.
Specifically, we allow for a finite number of market types. In a slight abuse of
notation we continue to index these market types by m. We assume that each market
contains the same number of assets, but that there is a total measure ωm of traders
in market m, with a supply per trader normalized to 1. With this notation, then, the
P
aggregate endowment is y = m ym ωm .
20

Calibration of market-specific λm : strategy. In the case of a single common λ
above, the value of λ was identified by matching a measure of systematic volatility,
the return volatility of a well-diversified portfolio of stocks. We now need to identify
a vector of segmentation parameters and we do this using a closely-related strategy.
In particular, we identify market types with quintile portfolios of stocks sorted on
measures of idiosyncratic volatility from Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006). They
compute value-weighted quintile portfolios by sorting stocks based on idiosyncratic
volatility relative to the Fama and French (1993) three-factor pricing model in postwar
CRSP data. To give a sense of this data, Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang report an
average standard deviation of (diversified) portfolio returns for the first quintile of
stocks of about 3.8% monthly (as opposed to about 4.3% for the market as a whole).
By construction this portfolio is 20% of a simple count of stocks but it constitutes about
54% of the market by value. At the other end of the volatility spectrum, the average
monthly standard deviation of a well-diversified portfolio of the fifth quintile of stocks
is about 8.2% and these constitute only about 2% of the market by value.
We choose the value of λm for m = 1, ..., 5 to match the total volatility of the
m’th quintile portfolio in Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang. Similarly, we choose values of ωm so that the unconditional average portfolio weight6 of the family in assets of market m matches the average market share for the m’th quintile portfolio
from Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006). Our calibration procedure chooses these
parameters simultaneously with the parameters σ̄, φ, σǫv of the stochastic process for
cross-sectional endowment volatility. We keep the values of the preference parameters
β, γ and the aggregate growth parameters ḡ, σǫg at their benchmark values. If there
was only one market type, then this calibration procedure coincides with the procedure
used for our benchmark model above.
Calibration of market-specific λm : results. The calibrated parameters from this
procedure are listed in Panel A of Table 4. We find that the m = 1 market, with the
lowest idiosyncratic volatility, has a segmentation parameter λ1 = 0.00 (to two decimal
places). These assets are essentially frictionless. This m = 1 market consists of 20% of
assets by number, by construction, but it accounts for 50% of the total market by value.
By contrast, the m = 5 market has segmentation parameter λ5 = 0.33 but accounts
for only 2% of total market value. Across markets the segmentation parameters λm
are monotonically increasing in m while the weights ωm are monotonically decreasing
P
in m. Averaging over the five markets λ̄ = m λm ωm = 0.11. Thus this economy,
6

The standard derivation of portfolio weights for the family is given in Appendix A below.

21

which matches the same aggregate moments as the benchmark model, hits its targets
with an average amount of segmentation λ̄ = 0.11 roughly half that of the single
parameter benchmark λ = 0.20. This suggests that there may be a significant bias when
aggregating a collection of heterogeneously segmented markets into a “representative”
segmented market.
Relative to the benchmark, the model’s endowment volatility process now has a
lower unconditional average, more time-series variation, and slightly less persistence.
Panel B of Table 4 shows that with these parameters the model matches the target
moments closely but not exactly. In particular, while the average idiosyncratic volatility
across the m markets is about 4.18% monthly as opposed to 4.17% in the data, this is
achieved with slight discrepancies at the level of each market, e.g., the 1st market has
volatility of 4.1% against 3.8% in the data.
Market-specific asset pricing implications. In Panel A of Table 5 we show the
risk premia for each market type in the model and their empirical counterparts. In the
data, the equity premia for the low volatility m = 1 market is 0.53% monthly (roughly
6.5% annual) whereas in the model it is 0.18% monthly. This market accounts for half
of total market value. As we go to markets with higher volatility, the model predicts
that risk premia monotonically increase, reaching 0.61% monthly (or 7.6% annual) for
the m = 5 market. However, the data predicts a hump-shaped pattern for the crosssection of equity premia, with the premia reaching a maximum at about 0.69% monthly
for the m = 3 market before falling to −0.53% for the 5th and most volatile market.
Thus the model fails to account declining equity premia of the smallest, and highest
idiosyncratic volatility, markets.

Aggregate asset pricing implications. In Panel B of Table 5 we show the aggregate asset pricing implications of the model with market-specific λm . The aggregate
equity premium is just 34 basis point lower than in the benchmark single λ model,
2.93% annual, despite the fact that the average segmentation here is only λ̄ = 0.11, half
the single λ benchmark. For comparison, the table shows the asset pricing implications
for an otherwise identical single λ economy with λ = λ̄ = 0.11. The aggregation of the
micro segmentation frictions across the different markets adds some 1% annual to the
equity premium, taking it from 1.9% to 2.9%. Compared to the benchmark model, the
risk free rate has about the same level and if anything is even more volatile.

22

Conclusion

We propose a tractable consumption-based model in order to explain and quantify
the macro impact of financial market frictions. We envision an economy comprised of
many micro financial markets that are partially segmented from one another. Because
of segmentation, traders in each micro market have to bear some local idiosyncratic risk.
Assets in every markets are priced by a convex combination of the local trader marginal
utility (who has to bear some of the idiosyncratic risk), and of the average marginal
utility in the rest of the economy (who can diversify the remaining idiosyncratic risk
in a large portfolio). We calibrate the model when all markets share the same level
of segmentation and show that it can generate a sizeable equity premium. We also
allow segmentation to differ across markets and show that aggregation matters: we can
obtain essentially the same aggregate asset pricing implication with a much smaller
average level of segmentation.

family. As show in the text, this results in a sequential budget constraint of the form:
cm + λm pm s′m + (1 − λm )T ′ ≤ λm (pm + ym )sm + (1 − λm )T − tm ,

where the new term tm are lump-sum taxes levied on market m by the government.
As in the main text T and T ′ represent the cum-dividend value of the family portfolio

Computational details

Setup. Let utility be CRRA with coefficient γ > 0 so u′ (c) = c−γ . Assume markets
come in M different types m ∈ {1, . . . , M}. Note that this is an abuse of notation given
that we previously used m to index a single market within the [0, 1] continuum. There
is an equal measure of assets, 1/M, in each market type. The total measure of traders
in a market of type m is denoted by ωm . Thus, we have the restriction:
M
X

ωm = 1.

m=1

The supply of asset per trader in a market of type m is Sm , so the total supply in that
market is Sm ωm . The dividend is ym = y ŷm where E [ŷm | g, σ] = 1. Since the aggregate
endowment is y, we have the restriction:
M
X

Sm ωm = 1.

m=1

27

The segmentation parameter in a market of type m is λm and the supply per trader is
Sm . In equilibrium, consumption in a market of type m is given by:
cm = y (Am + Bm ŷm ) ,
where
Am := (1 − λm )
and

M
X
1 − λn
n=1

1 − λ̄

Bm := λm Sm .
We then have qm = θm y −γ where:

En (An + Bn ŷn )−γ ωn ,

where En [·] is expectation conditional on past and current realizations of the aggregate
state. By the LLN this expectation calculates the cross-sectional average of x within
type n markets. We explain below how to compute this expectation. Now let p̂m :=
pm /y be the price/dividend ratio in a type m market. This solves:

Specification. The aggregate state is a VAR for log consumption growth and log
idiosyncratic volatility:
log gt+1 = (1 − ρ) log ḡ + ρ log gt + εg,t+1
log σt+1 = (1 − φ) log σ̄ + φ log σt − η (gt − log ḡ) + εv,t+1 ,
where 0 ≤ ρ, φ < 1 and where the two components of innovation, ǫg,t+1 and ǫv,t+1 , are
assumed to be contemporaneously uncorrelated. The dividend in market m is:
log ym,t = log yt + log ŷm,t ,

(33)

where the log idiosyncratic component is conditionally IID normal in the cross section:
2
2
log ŷm,t ∼ IID across m and N(−σmt
/2, σmt
)

σmt = σt σ̂m ,

for some time-invariant market specific volatility level σ̂m .

28

Approximation. Each market is characterized by 3 states: two aggregate states
(g, σ) and one idiosyncratic state ŷm (to simplify notation, we omit the ‘log’). Given
the specification above, the transition density is of the form:
f (g ′ , σ ′ , ŷ ′ | g, σ, ŷ) = f (g ′ , σ ′ | g, σ)f (ŷ ′ | σ ′ )
Our approximation follows Tauchen and Hussey (1991). First, we pick quadrature
nodes and weights for the aggregate state: consumption growth, Qg and Wg (column
vectors of size Ng ) and volatility, Qσ and Wσ (column vectors of size Nσ ). Following
the recommendation of Tauchen and Hussey, these nodes and weights are generated
according to the transition density evaluated at the mean, i.e., a bivariate Gaussian
density f (g ′ , σ ′ | ḡ, σ̄) which is the product of two independent normal densities with
means log ḡ, log σ̄, respectively, and variances σg2 and σv2 .
Then, for every value of σ, we generate quadrature nodes and weights in each market
m
type m, Qm
ŷ | σ and Wŷ | σ for the log idiosyncratic state log ŷ, according to a Gaussian
2
2
density with mean −σmt
/2 and variance σmt
. The resulting nodes and weights column
vectors have length Nσ × Nŷ . We adopt the convention that “idiosyncratic endowment
comes first:” that is, in the quadrature node vector, idiosyncratic endowment i under
volatility j is found in entry i + Nŷ (j − 1).
Combining these together, we have for each market a state space of size Ng ×Nσ ×Nŷ .
We Kroneckerize the weights and nodes vectors into vectors of length N ≡ Ng ×Nσ ×Nŷ ,
the size of the state space:
Vg = Qg ⊗ eNσ ⊗ eNy
Vσ = eNg ⊗ Qσ ⊗ eNy

Vŷm = eNg ⊗ Qm
ŷ | σ ,

where eN denotes a N × 1 vector of ones. The order of the Kronecker products follows
our convention that the state of idiosyncratic endowment i ∈ {1 . . . , Nŷ }, volatility
j ∈ {1, . . . , Nσ }, and aggregate consumption growth k ∈ {1, . . . , Ng } is found in entry
n = i + Nŷ (j − 1) + Nŷ Nσ (k − 1).
For instance, entry n of vector Vσ contains consumption growth if the state of market m is n. In other words, idiosyncratic endowment comes first, volatility second,
and consumption growth third. To get the quadrature weights, we use the following
calculation:
A = Wg ⊗ eNσ ⊗ eNy
B = eNg ⊗ Wσ ⊗ eNy

C m = eNg ⊗ Wŷm| σ ,

29

so that the quadrature weight for the state are:
W m = A. ∗ B. ∗ C m
where .∗ denotes Matlab coordinate-per-coordinate product.
Transition Probability Matrix. To implement the method of Tauchen and Hussey
(1991), we define a Matlab function:
f m (s′ | s) = f m (ŷ ′ | σ ′ ) × f (σ ′ | σ, g) × f (g ′ | g),
as well as the quadrature weighting function:
ω m (s) = ω m (ŷ | σ) × ω(σ) × ω(g).
Letting N ≡ Nŷ × Nσ × Ng , the matrix formula for the transition matrix is:
G = f m (eN Vŷ′ | eN Vσ′ ). ∗ f (eN Vσ′ | Vσ e′N , Vg e′N ). ∗ f (eN Vg′ | Vg e′N )


. ∗ (eN ∗ W ′ )./ eN . ∗ ω(Vŷ′ | Vσ′ ). ∗ ω(Vσ′ ). ∗ ω(Vg′ ) ,

which we then normalize so that the rows sum to 1.

Calculating cross-sectional moments. In many instance in the program we need
to calculate
E [xm | g, σ] ,
for some random variable xm . To do this, we consider:
Kσ = (INg ×Nσ ⊗ e′Nŷ ) [xm . ∗ W m ] ,
where
W m = eNg ⊗ Wŷm| σ .
The coordinate-wise product multiplies each realization of xm by its probability conditional on (g, σ), and the pre-multiplication adds up. We then re-Kroneckerize this in
order to obtain a N × 1 vector:
Kσ ⊗ eNŷ .

Table 3: Aggregate asset pricing implications of single λ model.
Aggregate asset pricing moments in postwar US data. All return data is monthly 1959:1-2007:12 and reported in annualized percent. The stock market index is the value
weighted NYSE return from CRSP, and the risk-free return is the 90 day T-bill rate. We obtain real returns after deflating by the CPI from
√ the BLS. Data on price/dividend
ratios is annual 1959-2007. To annualize monthly returns we multiply by 12 and to annualize monthly standard deviations we multiply by 12. In Table 6 below, we compare
annualized monthly returns to returns calculated by explicitly time-aggregating from monthly to yearly. The Benchmark model has a single common segmentation parameter
λ and time-varying idiosyncratic endowment volatility σt . The Constant σ model sets σt = σ̄ i.e., to the Benchmark unconditional mean, for all t. The Feedback model has
counter-cyclical endowment volatility, with feedback from aggregate growth gt to volatility σt governed by the elasticity η. See the main text for further details.

Table 6: Aggregate statistics in annualized monthly data and in monthly data time-aggregated to yearly.
Aggregate postwar US data. All return data is monthly 1959:1-2007:12 and reported in annualized percent. The stock market index is the value weighted NYSE return from
CRSP, and the risk-free return is the 90 day T-bill rate. Real consumption growth refers to the growth of real nondurables and services consumption per capita from the BEA.
The first column shows annualized
statistics for monthly data. To annualize monthly returns and consumption growth, we multiply by 12, and to annualize monthly standard
√
deviations, we multiply by 12. The second column shows statistics for yearly data, which are obtained by compounding returns and growth over the relevant time interval.
The only statistics that are substantially different in this second column concern the price dividend ratio: this is because, in the first column the dividend that enters the ratio
is the dividend per month, while in the second column it is the dividend paid over the entire year.
