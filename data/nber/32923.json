    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the distribution of political speech across U.S. firms. We develop a measure of political engagement based on firms\u2019 communications (earnings calls, regulatory filings, and social media), by training a large language model to identify statements that contain political opinions. Using these data, we document five facts about firms\u2019 political engagement. (1) Political engagement is rare among firms. (2) Political engagement is concentrated among large firms. (3) Firms tend to specialize in specific topics and outlets. (4) Large firms tend to engage in a wider set of topics and outlets. (5) The 2020 surge in firms\u2019 political engagement was associated with an increase in the engagement of medium-sized firms and a change in the mix of political topics.\n\n",
