    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a new equilibrium model in which households\u2019 labor supply choices form the link between sorting on the marriage market and sorting on the labor market. We first show that in theory, the nature of home production\u2014whether partners\u2019 hours are complements or substitutes\u2014shapes equilibrium labor supply as well as marriage and labor market sorting. We then estimate our model using German data to empirically assess the nature of home production, and find that spouses\u2019 home hours are complements. We investigate to what extent complementarity in home hours drives sorting and inequality. We find that home production complementarity strengthens positive marriage sorting and reduces the gender gap in hours and in labor sorting. This puts significant downward pressure on the gender wage gap and on within-household income inequality, but fuels between-household inequality. Our estimated model sheds new light on the sources of inequality in today\u2019s Germany, and\u2014by identifying important shifts in home production technology toward more complementarity\u2014on the evolution of inequality over time.\n\n",
