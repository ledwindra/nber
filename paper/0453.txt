Disequilibrium Dynamics With
Inventories and Anticipatory Price-Setting
ABSTRACT

This paper studies the sequence of short-run quantity-constrained
equilibria of a model with a single storable output, labor and money.
The durability of output gives rise to inventory fluctuations which
influence the course of the equilibria attained.
One special feature of interest is the assumption that prices are
not at the level which would equilibrate all markets if there were no
stochastic shocks to the economy.

With prices frozen at this level, the

nature of the realized shocks determines the type of disequilibrium realized
and the unintended component of inventory change.
The analysis concentrates on two questions: What is the statistical
nature' of the process governing the real wage, output, employment and
inventories?

And is it possible to test this model against the alternative

hypothesis that prices are continually flexible even after the shocks
have disturbed the system?

We find that although these theories are similar

in their qualititive structure, tests can be developed.

We also show

how the frequencies of different types of quantity-constrained equilibria
vary with the stochastic specification.

This may shed some insight on why

it is commonly believed that some types 9f disequilibrium phenomena have
not been observed.

Introduction
The microeconomic foundation of macroeconomics has two fairly wellarticulated paradigms.

The neo-classical paradigm maintains that "markets

are working":competitive behavior achieves a Pareto optimal outcome under
the guidance of the price system.

Authorities should interfere as little

as possible with this allocation mechanism as long as competitive behavior is
maintained.

The lack of future and contingent markets pointed out by some

has been overcome through the assumption of rational expectations.

The

Keynesian paradigm on the contrary maintains that "markets are not working".
Price rigidities, even with competitive behavior, lead to a misallocation of
resources which can be partially remedied by government interventions.

This

malfunctioning of the price system is explained by informational considerations in the absence of a complete set of markets.

The Keynesian paradigm

has recently received an extreme formalization in the work of Barro and
Grossman [1971], Benassy [1975], Dr~ze [1975], Malinvaud [1977] and others,
through the theoretical construct of fixed-price equilibria.
Although the assumption of fixed prices provides a reasonable explanation of a number of short-run phenomena, such as the multiplier effect
or the accelerator principle, it is incomplete in that it fails to provide
a theory to determine the level at which prices are fixed.

The short-run

equilibria attained will be markedly affected by the mechanism used to
describe price formation.

Via this route, the dynAmics of macroeconomic

fluctuations are affected by the price change proc(-'ss as well.
,

The basic assumption of this paper is an attempt to be specific about
price formation while retaining a fixed-price, qllantity-constrained equili-

bration in the short-run.

We assume that prices are.fixed at the beginning

of the period' at the level which would be the Halrasian· equilibrium i f all
random factors in the economy had their average levels.
this as anticipatory

pricing.

We will refer to

Thus there is a tendency toward market

clearing, but short-run disturbances continually keep it from being achieved.
This assumption should be contrasted with that previously used in the
disequilibrium literature where measured excess demands were responsible for
price changes in the following period.

Anticipatory pricing has the advan-

tage of being simpler, especially in the analysis of the stochastic evolution
of the system.

Furthermore, as the empirical evidence does not provide'

support for the hypothesis that excess demand is a principal determinant of
price changes, we felt that it was necessary to explore an alternative. Our assumrt:ion is
somewhat intermediate between the Walrasian (flexible prices) and Keynesian
short-run

(fixed prices) models, and it has n certain "rational expectations"

flavor.*
The second theme of this paper is the role of inventories in macrodynamics
ceived much

a topic of long-recognized importance, but one which has not reattention within the disequilibrium literature.** This is rather

ironic, as it is commonplace to assert that the role of such stocks is to
cushion the effects of unforeseen fluctuations in demands and supplies,
presumably those that are undesired at the prevailing prices.

We will

*

It is not, however, a full "rational expectations" model because the
rational forecasts of future prices do not enter the current notional demand
curves. This will be discussed further in the next section.
**

Blinder-Fischer (1979) have examined flexible price models with inventories in which the rate of interest is a determinant of the desired level
of inventory stocks. They do not address the stochastic nature of the dynamics explicity, whereas this is our principal focus. Blinder (977) has examined
a Keynesian model with inventories and a price dynamics that responds to
lagged excess demands. Muellbauer and Partes (1978) have a short-run quantity
constrained model with inventories based on explicit maximization by rational
agents. They derive the effective demand functions to which our specification
can be regarded as a first-order approximation. Although they have obtained
many short-run comparative statics results they have not linked the successive
quantity-constrained equilibria together in a dynamic analysis.

-3-

analyze how the level of inventories interacts with the level of prices
and wages, and how the spillover effects in a fixed-price equilibrium
produce certain testable characteristics in

macro time series data.

We will argue that these can be used to discriminate between a model of the
type we study and the analagous flexible-price system.
In Section 1 we set out the basic model and discuss its assumptions.
Section 2 derives the short-run quantity-constrained equilibrium as it
depends on initial inventory stocks and on the random disturbances within
the period.

Section 3 presents, for comparison purposes, the analagous

results under conditions of full price flexibility after these shocks
are realized.
Sections 4 and 5 are the heart of the paper.

We first derive the

probabilistic nature of the equilibrium under a variety of stochastic
specifications.

The probabilities of different types of quantity constrained

equilibria can be compared under these alternative hypotheses.

Then, we

use these results to present the dynamics of inventory behavior and the
statistical relationships between real wages, inventories and employment.
We emphasize the possibility of using this type of analysis to test the
disequilibrium hypothesis with anticipatory pricing, against the marketclearing assumptions.
Our theoretical model suggests several lines of empirical investigation.
In an appendix, we present some time series evidence on the relationships
between the important variables of our system.

These are of a preliminary

nature and are not des1gned to test our view of the theory presented.

They

are nevertheless suggestive particularly because of the unexpectedly large
effect of inventories on the real wage.

The Model

Basic Structure
The model to be described below has two stores of value, money and inventories, which interact together with the flow demands and supplies on
the labor and output markets to determine a short-run equilibrium.

Successive

short-run equilibria are linked together by the dynamics of inventory movements and the prices and wages which result from them.
Before deriving the stochastic structure of this dynamic disequilibrium
process, we should discuss the nature of the model -- and especially the
central role to be played by inventories and the price formation mechanism.
Inventories are accumulated as the result of an excess of output over sales
to consumers. * It is assumed that such sales of output are entirely consumed; the inventories are owned exclusively by firms.
balances are held only by households.
of goods in excess of labor income.

Similarly, money

They are used to finance purchases
Both inventory levels and real money

balances are desired because they provide the individual decision makers
with flexibility in case they are unable to fully execute their desired transactions.

In the aggregate, therefore, we will assume a positive desired in-

ventory stock and that the level real balances enters the demand and supply
function of households.

** ***

*

Bl inder (1978) offers an extensive discussion of inventories as inputs, but
finally assumes that their role as residual output is dominant, as we do.

** It should be mentioned, or rather confessed, at the outset, thattl1is formulation does not treat the role of firms' profits and their imputation back
to the household sector in a consistent fashion. Implicitly, any money balances
accumulated by firms are immediately transferred back to the household sector,
but these profits are not anticipated at all. Hnner competitive conditions -that is with many households, each of whom treats profit income as independent
of their own actions -- this formalization is consistent with a 100% profits
tax and a monetary policy designed to keep the nominal stock of money constant.

Because firms wish·to maintain some inventories, part of planned production may be intended for inventory accumulation.

An increase in inven-

tory stocks is not, by itself, enough to indicate that fi rms could not sell
all they wanted to.

The actual variation in these stocks is a composite of

the intended and unintended changes.
The price-setting process is conceptualized as follows:
in discrete intervals.
each period.

Time is measured

The level of inventories is known at the beginning of

Further the expected values of demands and supplies of goods and labor

as functions of the nominal prices and the stocks of money and inventories
are known.

These functions may differ from their expected values because

of unforeseeable, random events.

Prices are set during the period at

the values that would clear the market if these expectations were all
realized.

During the period they remain rigid, and it is this inflexibility

which is the source of the disequilibrium dynamics that we will be studying.
Obviously the extreme nature of this process is not to be justified
on the grounds that it precisely represents the workings of any economy.
Moreover, the length of the period affects the extent of the disequilibrium
generated by the temporarily frozen price levels in a serious way, and no
one choice can really be defended.

Nevertheless we believe that the study

of this model can provide useful insights and that it can be viewed as an
approximation to an actual economy in which a variety of disequilibrium
adjustments are taking place simultaneously.

After giving an algebraic

statement of the model, we will return to such a discussion.

-6-

Mathematical Specification
In order to make the model tractable we will impose a linear structure on the supply and demand functions.

Following Barra - Grossman (1971)

and Malinvaud (1977) the amount by which an agent is constrained below his
desired level of purchase or sale in one market enters

The theory of household behavior differs from the theoryeor firma
because it is the households who hold money balances.

Since we will treat

the case of a constant money stock throughout, nominal prices and price
expectations are sufficient to specify the level of real balances.

Because

we take the view that the unit of time is rather short compared with the
planning horizon of the household, the principal determinant of the households' demand for real balances is its expectation of future prices and
wages.

It will be shown below that prices in any period depend solely on the

predetermined inventory level.

Moreover, because inventories will follow

astationary Markov process, in the long run the average level of prices
and wages is known.

Under these conditions the price and wage expectations

relevant to demands at any moment in time can, to a first approximation, be
regarded as exogenous and fixed.

Thus (1.9) and (1.10) include prices

and wages because of their short run effects, but need include neither
expectations nor money balances explicitly. *

While these quantity adjustment rules can be criticized on several grounds,
they have the great advantage of providing analytical tractibility.

They

also lead to a theory that can, in principal, be tested against a corresponding equilibrium theory.

Discussion of the Model
Although there is no firm microeconomic foundation for our assumption
that prices are fixed at their anticipated Wa1rasian levels, and are then
frozen there for the ensuing period, we had several reasons for adopting
such a formulation.

It is clear that in any macroeconomic model that deals

with sufficiently short time periods, neither the assumption of perfect
price flexibility nor the assumption of quantity flexibility would be
rea~onable.

The world is in continual disequilibrium to a much greater

extent then either pure formalization admits.

In this paper we will

emphasize quantities as the equilibrating vRr:l.ables. while recognizi.ng
that this is but one extreme among a continuum of possibilities.

In any

context where one adopts either the strict price-flexibility or quantityflexibility paradigms, the length of the period in question makes a big
difference as to whether the model does or does not approximate the reality.
Our choice of the price level at the anticipated Wa1rasian equilibrium
should be compared with several other possibilities.

Most of the literature

on disequilibrium macroeconomics * has assumed that prices adjust from their
lagged values according to the lagged value of excess demand.

*

In our model,

In the econometrics literature, both adjustment of prices to past excess
demands and partial adjustment to current excess demands have been used (see
for example Fair and Jaffee [1974], Laffont and Garcia [1977]. In the
economic theory literature adjustment to past excess demands has been the
rule (see Honkapohja [1979], Laroque (forthcoming».

one of the impacts of previous disequilibria is to alter the level of
stocks.

Therefore prices in our model will be higher after a period of

excess demand for goods, as in these systems.

The analogous property

does not apply to the wage rate, as labor services are not durable, nor
is there explicitly intertemporal substitution of labor for leisure over
individuals' lifetimes.
These two price adjustment hypotheses are hard to compare on empirical
grounds.

One reason why prices are likely to appear responsive to lagged

excess demands is the auto correlation of errors.

monitoring and responding to the current state of disequilibrium t the firms
and workers might try to use pricing rules designed to approximate an
efficient market-clearing system. *
In planned economies there is some evidence that prices are set so
as to approximate equilibria that are forecasted.

This may provide a justi-

fication of our anticipatory pricing assumption in modelling such systems.

To take one alternative, we might suppose that prices are set at the
mathematical expectation of the ex post equilibrium. The difficulty
with this assumption is that the bias of these prices away from

depends upon the distribution of the disturbances € . Therefore a complicated
pair of non-linear equations would have to be sOlvea to find the prices and
wages, in contrast to the simple system (1.20) .- (1.21).
Another price-setting mechanism is that prices are only incompletely flexible
within the period. They end up somewhere between their lagged values and the
location of the market-clearing equilibrium. This amounts to an adjustment
in response to current, rather than lagged, excess demands. This hypothesis
is attractive in that the length of the period can be reflected in the specification of the adjustment speed. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain
tractable dynamic results.

Short-run equilibria

flexibility

For future reference, it is useful at this point to derive the
prices, wages and equilibrium quantities that would arise if prices and
wages were to adjust so as to clear both markets after the realization of
the disturbances.

Setting (1.14) equal to (1.15), (1.16) equal to (1.17)

and ignoring all the terms involving sp,illover

effects we can derive the

following expression for the equilibrium real wage:

These stability con-

ditions will be satisfied whenever 01 and 02 are relatively small (see
the right hand side of (1.24».

The comparative statics of the equilibrium

model with respect to inventories and shocks can be derived in a straightforward way.

It may be seen that the real wage responds negatively to

initial inventories, positively to shocks that increase the excess demand
for labor, and positively to shocks that increase the excess demand for
goods.

These comparative statics are in accordance with one's intuition

that initial inventories are a substitute for labor inputs in the short-run
production process.

4. ' Probabilistic structure of the short-run quantity'- constrained equilibria
The principal question answered in this section is how the stochastic
specification of the model induces the probabilities that each of the four
types of quantity-constrained equilibria will arise.

In complete generality,

the symmetry with which our model treats the goods and labor markets makes
it impossible to derive specific conclusions about this distribution.

But

employing plausible qualitative conditions on the parameters, combined
with assumptions on the relative variances of the errors, we find limitations
on the forms of the disequilibria that can arise.

Depending on the specification

used, one or two of the regimes can be proven to be much less likely than
the others.
First one should note the obvious point that anticipatory price
setting makes the nature of the equilibrium independently determined from
one period to the next.
Let us assume that the

It is probably reasonable to expect that firms are more

sensitive to constraints than are individuals.

The permanent income hypothesis

in its purest form would not leave any room for spillover effects in consumption or in labor supply.

Firms, although infinitely 11ved in principal,

do not allow their inventories to serve as a complete buffer when plans
cannot be carried out.

Some of the impact of sales constraints is to

lower production, even in the short-run.

The highest probabilities are associated with the Keynesian unemp1oyment (Regime 1) and repressed inflation (Regime 3) modes, where the correlations are positive.

An intuition for this result can be derived from

the observation that when errors occur one at a time only Regime I and 3
are possible.

This point is due to the fact that the first effect of a

shock is to constrain one agent (firms or consumers) in one market and by
the spillover effect the other agent in the other market.

The stability

conditions imply that one remains then in a regime where both agents are
constrained, i.e. either Keynesian unemployment or repressed inflation.
The comparison between Regimes I and 3 and between Regimes 2 and 4 is
difficult and depends on the variances and on the spillover coefficients.
One possibility to obtain further results can be obtained if we are willing
to make the assumption that shocks originating on the consumers' side of
both markets are small compared to producers shocks.*

either way. *

Three Cases of Non-Independent Shocks
We shall now consider three cases where the errors are interpreted
as shocks to the technology and preferences of a particular form and are
not, therefore, independent across the equations.

For individuals the argument is slightly more involved, but one obtains similar extreme cases as approximations.

Therefore the appropriate increase in

demand for goods, under the hypothesis that all of this income is to be

is more likely than repressed inflation, one would have to invoke a bias

This would make the analysis of the quantity-

constrained equilibrium virtually as complex as the system with independent
errors.

It is more tractable if we take the approximation that w - Pt is,
t
in the long-run, equal to the real marginal product of labor g. This would

give us
(4.4)

which is analagous to (4.2). Alternatively, we can suppose that the extra
earnings are divided between spending on goods and accumulation of money
balances in the same proportion that the individual allocates his constrained
labor income.

Since one unit less of labor supply causes goods demand to

drop by b, we obtain

It is possible to examine each of the four possible combinations of

cases.

We will see that the results are rather sensitive to this specification.

We now consider the case where none of the effects of the shocks
impact upon the stocks of inventories or of money balances:

(4.2) and (4.4):

for flows.)

example, suitable unemployment/vacancy data would be relevant to
the labor market. Evidence in the goods market is harder to ascertain
since intended inventory movements may be confounded with flow disequilibrium.

Dynamic Behavior of Quantity-Constrained

E~ui1ibrium

Process

In this section we will utilize the stochastic structure derived
above to study the dynamics of inventories, employment, output, the real
wage and correlations among them.

We will compare the results of the

disequilibrium model to those arising from a system where prices are
flexible

the realization of the shocks, as described in Section 3.

In particular we will ask whether or not these systems are "observationally
equivalent", and we will suggest methods for testing one of these hypotheses against the other.

The dynamics of

In this model inventories are entirely composed of unsold stocks of
final goods.

Because there is no depreciation, the change in stocks is

simply the difference between production and sales.

The evolution of in-

ventories is described by

As the details are straightforward, we will only summarize the results here.
If the four shocks are independent, little can be said in general
about the Markov process defined by (5.4).

The mean value of the error

term averaged over the four regimes will not be zero because they enter
in a piecewise linear, rather than a linear, fashion.

Therefore the long-

"

run average for St will be biased away from its target s.
It is interesting to ask whether the time series behavior of inventories can be used to distinguish between this model and the equilibrium
model of Section 3.
Using (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3) we can see that in the equilibrium stock
adjustment equation will be of the same general form as (5.5) but the
errors enter linearly.

This suggests the following test of the equilibrium

model.
Write the equilibrium model as

These qual i-

the four regimes:

the estimated constants in Regime 1 exceed those of Regimes

Moreover these constraints

can provide an algorithm for partitioning the data, if (4.2) and (4.5)
are adopted as maintained hypotheses.

For example, if

We might therefore begin by running the unconstrained regression

ignoring the biased error term, and then assign that half of the data

with the largest residuals to Regime 4 and the others to Regime 2.

This method is reminiscent of the Fair - Jaffee (1972) procedure.

Another case of interest, paralleling the treatment of the last section,
occurs where the shocks affect current notional demands and desired stocks
in the same proportion as would quantity constraints:

test of the disequilibrium

model under the maintained hypotheses (4.3), (4.5), is to segregate the data
into two subsets, presumably those in or out of Regime 4, and test for the
inequality of the constants in these separate regressions.

(Of course this

will be a weaker test than the full maximum likelihood procedure, but the
computational advantages may be significant.)
Other combinations .of (4.2) (4.3) and (4.4) (4.5) can be studied with
similar results.

In the equilibrium model employment is given by (3.2).

Note that the

systematic dependence of employment on inventories is the same under either
theory.
As in the case of the autocorrelation of the inventory series, the
difference lies in the stochastic structure.

Different constant terms in

the regressions within each regime would provide evidence for the disequilibrium hypothesis.
We will not elaborate upon the possibilities under all the stochastic
specifications treated previously.

It is useful, however, to examine one of

them again because it indicates how a combination of evidence on inventories
and employment can help identify regimes and provide a sharper discrimination
between these theories.
Consider the case of (4.3) and (4.5), where disturbances impinge upon
notional demand for stocks in both sectors.

Correlation between real wages

Both the disequilibrium and equilibrium models predict a negative
correlation between real wages and employment when (01 + 02) is relatively

Tests based on the stochastic structure similar to those described

above can be constructed, but we believe that they will be harder to use.

Appendix
We gather together a few regression results that are related to the
results of this paper.

No attempt is made to give a detailed treatment of

problems in structural estimation of macroeconomic systems.

These results

should be viewed merely as exploring some correlations in the data, and not
as necessarily confirming or disproving specific hypotheses.
Nevertheless we believe they are of interest.

In particular they

point out the strong influence of inventories on the real wage.
The variables used are:
W, wage The real wage in the manufacturing sector.

Computed as the

ratio"of hourly earnings to the implicit price deflator for
personal consumption expenditures.
H, hours

The measure of total manufacturing employment.

Computed as

the product of weekly hours for production workers with total
employment in the manufacturing sector.
INV, inventories

Total inventories in the manufacturing sector.

IMP, import price
index

Index of unit-values of imported goods.

All data are seasonally adjusted.
We present three sets of regressions for monthly, quarterly and annual
data.

In accordance with the theory, we treat as exogenous the initial level

of inventories.
In the monthly regressions we use the previous month's value.

In

both quarterly and annual regressions we use the value associated with the
last month of the previous time period.
The wage, hours inventories and import prices are used in logarithms,
time is not used as a logarithm.

Summary of Results
The principal reason for performing three separate types of regressions
is that we do not know the timing of the anticipatory pricing and the shocks
which are supposed to be accomodated by disequilibrium quantity adjustments.

No attempt was made to search for regressions with more explanatory

power, but we do present two forms of the equations according to whether
the import price index variable is included.

It was felt that this variable

is largely exogenous and that it exerts a strong influence on prices and
output quite independent of the inventory situation.
