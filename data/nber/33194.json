    "abstract": "\n\nWe evaluate private equity (PE) performance using investor-specific stochastic discount factors, and examine whether investors could benefit from changing their allocation to PE. Plans invest in PE funds with higher average risk-adjusted performance. This is mainly due to access to successful PE managers, not superior selection skill. Decomposing returns into risk-compensation and \"alpha\",  we find that some plans obtain higher PE returns by taking more risk without earning higher, and in some cases earning lower, risk-adjusted returns, broadly consistent with agency problems within plans.\n\n",
