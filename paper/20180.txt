ABSTRACT
The use of directed giving - allowing donors to target their gifts to specific organizations or functions
- is pervasive in fundraising, yet little is known about its effectiveness. We conduct a field experiment
at a public university in which prospective donors are presented with either an opportunity to donate
to the unrestricted Annual Fund, or an opportunity of donating to the Annual Fund and directing some
or all of their donation towards the academic college from which they graduated. While there is no
effect on the probability of giving, donations are significantly larger when there is the option of directing.
However, the value of the option does not come directly from use, as very few donors choose to direct
their gift.

Introduction

The use of directed giving - allowing donors to target their gifts to specific organizations or functions - is pervasive in fundraising. As early as 1994, United Way
responded to a drop in contribution levels by introducing donor choice, for the first
time allowing donors to select the organization to receive their donation (Barman,
2002). Targeting proved popular, and grew to 18.4% of donations by 1999. United
Way’s 2012 annual report notes that 47% of assets are unrestricted, reflecting the
overall pattern of giving nationwide.1 However, surprisingly little is known about
its effectiveness for increasing donations, nor the potential costs and other ramifications. In particular, if a large proportion of giving is restricted in its use, charities’
flexibility in allocating their resources would be reduced.2
While directed giving clearly plays an important role in fundraising, there are
no previous controlled studies designed to directly assess its impact in the field. We
conduct a field experiment in conjunction with the Association of Former Students
(AFS) at Texas A&M University in which prospective donors can either donate to
the Annual Fund (the standard way in which AFS raises money), or have the option
of directing some or all of their gift to an Academic Fund benefiting the academic
college housing the department from which they graduated. We randomly assign
former students to one of these two treatments and find no effect on the probability
of giving, yet much larger donations from those who did give. Surprisingly, very
few donors choose to direct any part of their gift. Altogether, our results suggest
that donors who would have given regardless respond to being offered a choice by
giving more, but do not take up the option; at least in our context, concerns about
earmarking are unfounded.
Several experimental studies explore topics related to directed giving. Li et al.
(2013) provide the first lab-experimental evidence (to our knowledge) measuring the
1

The United Way national organization does not report donations by restricted status. The
regional organizations vary considerably, but average around half of giving as unrestricted.
2
No less an authority than the online humor magazine Cracked discussed this problem in an
article entitled “5 Popular Forms of Charity (That Aren’t Helping),” giving a number of examples
in which earmarked donations caused a “massive imbalance in funding that leads to some serious
bureaucratic absurdities.” (Hill, 2012)

impact of targeted giving. In a “real charity” lab experiment, where subjects make
donations from their earnings to charitable organizations, they show that targeting
has a positive impact on donations. The study compares directed giving to two
specific causes – disaster relief and cancer research – with donations to the United
Way general fund. A similar comparison is made for government organizations, with
the “Gifts to the United States” fund, which feeds into federal revenue, as the general
fund. They find that targeting specific causes more than doubles the likelihood of
giving and the size of contributions, relative to the general funds. The impact of
targeting is significantly greater for government organizations, most likely due to the
broader portfolio of functions under the government umbrella.
Two additional types of experimental studies provide insight into the potential
value of directed giving. Small and Loewenstein (2003) use lab and field experiments
to explore the “identifiable victim” phenomenon: people will often give substantially
more to an identifiable than a statistical victim. For example, in 1987, one child,
“Baby Jessica,” became a media sensation when she fell into a well near her home
in Texas, and she received over $700,000 in donations from the public. They find
that a recipient who has already been selected from a list of possible targets receives
larger donations that one who has not yet been selected from the list: the difference
was 62% in a lab experiment and 26% in a field experiment. This suggests that
allowing donors to target a specific victim may substantially increase giving. It
is this impulse that is exploited in fundraising campaigns such as World Vision,
Compassion International, or Children International, which ask donors to sponsor a
specific child through regular donations.
A second type of study examines “paternalistic” donor restrictions. For example,
a donor might be willing to contribute more if they can control how a recipient is
allowed to spend the money. Batista et al. (2014) report the result of lab-in-thefield experiments in Tanzania where the recipient is the closest person to the donor
outside their family. They show that donors are willing to give about 14% more
when they have the option to give goods rather than in cash. The magnitude of the
effect is larger than other experimental manipulations such as the price of giving or
the endowment to the donors. In a related study, Jones (2014) shows that even when
2

such paternalistic restrictions are costly, about 60 percent of subjects are willing to
pay to restrict the use of a donation so that it cannot be spent on cigarettes, alcohol
or drugs. These studies illustrate the responsiveness of giving when donors have the
ability to target the use of the funds.

2

Experimental Design

In order to isolate the impact of directed giving, we designed a natural field experiment centered around creating exogenous variation in the option to direct a donor’s
gift. The experimental design consisted of two subject groups: standard (Annual
Fund Only) and directed (Annual or Academic Funds). Both groups received an
e-mail describing the values of Texas A&M University and asking for support in the
form of a donation. The e-mails received are identical, including the subject line,
with one exception: the directed group was also provided an option of directing a gift
to the donor’s academic college. The control group did not receive any option, as is
standard for the AFS Annual Fund. All other aspects of the request for a donation
were the same as AFS’s normal solicitations.
Subjects were contacted via nearly identical e-mails, with the only difference in
solicitation consisting of one additional sentence for the directed group. For the control group, the e-mail appeal only gave the Annual Fund as the possible recipient:
“Your gift to The Association of Former Students’ Annual Fund supports scholarships, academic excellence, and student organizations across the university.” The
e-mail to the directed group included a sentence presenting an option of directing
a donation (addition in italics): “Your gift to The Association of Former Students’
Annual Fund supports scholarships, academic excellence, and student organizations
across the university. You can also choose to direct some or all of your gift specifically
to support programs at your academic college.”
Each e-mail contained a hyperlink to a web page for the donor to make a donation.
Two web pages were designed, one for each group, in order to provide the directed
group an entry option for donations to the academic college from which the donor
graduated. The option to donate to the academic college was in addition to the
3

standard entry option for the Annual Fund which was included in both the directed
and control web pages.3
The control and directed groups were created from a list of donors that had given
in 2012, but had not yet given in 2013. Subjects were randomly assigned, stratifying
the sample on college, year of graduation and gender, into two groups, with 5,303
control recipients and 5,302 directed recipients. Table 1 shows p-values for balance
between the two samples; it is clear that the randomization was successful. The two
lists of potential donors were provided to the AFS to administer the appeal. The
AFS handled the lists separately to ensure the correct e-mail body was sent but
otherwise the appeal operated in the standard fashion.4
The first round of e-mails was sent on December 19, 2013. A second e-mail for
non-respondents was sent on December 27, 2013. Donations were received through
the two websites administered by the AFS as well as by check. Donations stopped
being recorded for our data on December 31, 2013. The results which follow utilize
all donations received by the control and directed groups during this time period.
The randomization in the sample permits the interpretation that the experimental
trigger caused donations through any channel.

Results

There is little difference in the probability of giving across the conditions; 442 donors
(8.3%) gave in the control (Annual Fund Only) treatment, while 454 donors (8.6%)
gave in the directed (Annual and Academic Funds) treatment. Figure 1 shows the
distribution of donations, conditional on making a gift, by treatment; it is evident
that there are somewhat fewer small gifts and somewhat more very large gifts when
donors are given a choice. This is borne out by the comparison of means in Table
2, in which we show that while there is no difference in the giving rate between the

two treatments, the average gift is substantially larger in the choice condition. The
unconditional average gift size is $7.61 larger when donors can target their gift (p
= 0.01). Since the giving rates do not differ, it is unsurprising that this pattern
carries over to the gift size conditional on giving, which is $82.33 larger in the choice
condition. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows that the distributions of the two groups are
different at p = 0.092.
Due to the presence of a number of large gifts in the choice condition, we examine
the results after Winsorizing the gifts conditional on giving at 1% and 5%. That is,
we set the top 1% (or 5%) of the conditional distribution of donations equal to the
99th (or 95th ) percentile; thus, the observations are still counted in the statistics but
have a less-outsized influence. The results are unchanged: the differences for both
1% and 5% Winsorizing are still statistically significant; we therefore conclude that
our results are not entirely driven by outliers, though much of the impact of choice
seems to be driven by a greater proportion of very large gifts.
Given that our experiment focuses on the effects of choice, we next turn to
whether donors choose to direct their gifts when the choice is available. Strangely,
despite clearly giving greater amounts in response to the availability of choice, few
donors choose to actually utilize that choice. Only 11 donors in the choice condition
made any gift to the Academic Fund, just 2.4% of respondents.5 Among these 11
individuals, 56.0% of dollars were directed to the Academic Fund, with a median of
50%; only two donors chose to direct the whole of their gift. These donors gave $209
more than their non-directing counterparts in the choice condition, but the sample
is so small that this difference is significant only at p = 0.22.

Conclusion

Taken together, our results suggest that donors who were planning on giving regardless have a preference for being offered a choice; the choice condition has no impact
on the probability of making a gift, but a large impact on the amount given condi5

tional on making a gift. However, these donors do not, in general, avail themselves
of the option to give. This has implications for charities considering whether to allow donors to direct their gifts. In all, the Association of Former Students raised
approximately $40,000 more by allowing for choice than it would have otherwise,
with only about 2% of the $148,914 raised in the choice condition being restricted to
the Academic Fund. It appears that allowing for choice increases donations without
limiting charities’ flexibility in allocating donations.
Future work will allow for a wider set of choices, including short or long menus
that do or do not include the unrestricted Annual Fund as an option. This will allow
for further investigation of both the hypothesized “paradox of choice” in the context
of charitable giving, as well as whether donors merely value the appearance of choice.
