The questions I try to answer are: What are the factors determining the wife's productivity at home? What is the value of home production and how does it compare with the family's money in-come? How does the value of home production differ among families with different socioeconomic backgrounds? How is it affected by the wife's labor force participation and by the existence of young children? How does it changeover the family's life cycle?\n\n",
