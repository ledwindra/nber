    "abstract": "\n\nDisplaced workers su\ufb00er large and persistent earnings losses. These losses can be mitigated by returning to school, yet the extent to which such workers enroll in post-secondary education in response to displacement is poorly understood. Using employer-employee-student matched administrative data from Ohio, we provide the \ufb01rst direct evidence of workers\u2019 enrollment responses following mass layo\ufb00s in the United States. Close to 10% of these displaced workers enroll in public two- or four-year colleges after displacement, with the typical enrollment persisting for \ufb01ve semesters and 29% completing a degree. However, much of this enrollment may have occurred regardless of the displacement. To estimate a causal e\ufb00ect, we compare displaced workers over time to similar non-displaced workers. We estimate that for every 100 displaced workers, only about 1 is ever induced to enroll in a public college as a result. This e\ufb00ect is concentrated almost entirely among displaced manufacturing workers, who enroll at a rate of 2.5 per every 100. Such workers with lower within-\ufb01rm earnings and from local labor markets with limited for-pro\ufb01t college options are the most likely to enroll in public institutions.\n\n",
