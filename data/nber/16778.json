    "abstract": "\n\nHow does a country's productivity growth a\u00a4ect worldwide real incomes through international trade? In this paper, we take this classic question to the data by measuring the spillover e\u00a4ects of China's productivity growth. Our framework features traditional terms-of-trade e\u00a4ects and new trade home market e\u00a4ects as suggested by the theoretical literature and works from a reference point which perfectly matches industry-level trade. Focusing on the years 1995 to 2007, we find that the spillover e\u00a4ects of China's productivity growth are small causing the real incomes of China's trading partners to increase by only 0.1 percent on average.\n\n",
