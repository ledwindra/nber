Cross Country Fairness Considerations and Country Implications of Alternative Approaches
to a Global Emission Reduction Regime

ABSTRACT
The UNFCCC process of negotiating multilateral carbon emissions reductions thus far has focused
on approximately equiproportional cuts in annual carbon emissions by country along the lines of the
Kyoto Protocol agreement. But now, with the objective of involving large developing countries such
as China and India in a post 2012 regime, broader considerations imply alternative approaches to emissions
reduction arrangements by countries be considered. Here we consider the implications of alternative
cross country fairness considerations entering the global negotiation process using a numerical simulation
model which captures the potential impacts of alternative emission reductions across major economies
which in turn reflect different fairness arguments. We put other fairness considerations, such as intergenerational
equity, on one side. We use a global equilibrium emissions and trade model with transfers which are
calibrated to a 2005-2050 BAU scenario and treats damage from climate change as utility damage.
It thus captures the benefit side of emissions reduction agreements as well as the implications of such
considerations for financial transfers agreed as a part of the process. Our analyses consider four alternative
justices formulations. One is equal per capita allocation of absorptive capacity of the atmosphere given
a temperature change target for global emissions. Yet another is where cuts by countries yield equal
benefits per capita to other countries. A third is where there are equal costs per capita to countries
making cuts. Finally, we also consider financial transfers to developing countries to compensate them
for the costs of meeting emission restraints. The impacts of alternative emissions reductions differ
sharply from the equi-proportional cuts of annual emissions implied by a continuation of the Kyoto
process. These impacts emphasize the large and ill defined bargaining set for a post Kyoto Process
involving large developing countries in a significant way.

1. Introduction
The proposals for carbon emission reductions by country that were made during the
various UNFCCC COP meetings over the period 2008-2012 for the post 2012 period after
present arrangements under the Kyoto protocol expire have been based largely on equal
proportional reductions in annual emissions by countries of greenhouse gases measured in
carbon equivalent terms. These proposed cuts were seen as simple and based on apparent
similar treatment to all. It was seemingly assumed by major participant developed countries
that the main point of contention remaining was the depth of cuts.
The cuts resulting from this approach have, however, been vigorously opposed by
developing countries who fear that such commitments will truncate their development, and
emphasize how the “common but differentiated responsibility” declaration in the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) gives them rights to special
treatment. Countries who have only recently industrialized, such as China and India, have
also argued that cumulative, not annual emissions should be used. And they have also
argued that historical emissions should be taken into account and differential impacts
implied by their high growth rates be taken into account.
The implied departures from equiproportional reductions increase further if other
fairness arguments are allowed. Countries with large resource producing industries can also
claim larger than average adjustments will ensure for them, and hence they should receive
special treatment. Economies with lax migration policies and hence growing populations can
claim that allowance should be made for their changing numbers. And countries with already
high excise taxes on gasoline and fuels can argue their case for smaller reductions.
While the negotiating process has seemingly reached on impasse in Durban in cuts 2011,
there remains a commitment to continued negotiation out to 2015. Here, in light of this
commitment, we assess the potential implications of adopting various concepts of cross
country fairness as the basis for country cuts in a post Kyoto regime, rather than appealing to
the simplicity of equiproportional reductions. We develop several inter-related equity
notions to explore their implications in a global emission reduction model capturing both
costs and benefits of reductions. One uses the global emissions reductions implied by equal
2

per capita allocation of the emissions constraint on the absorptive capacity of the
atmosphere given a target for global temperature change by a specific date. This allocation
may or may not take into account historical emissions. Another appeals to reductions which
yield equal benefits to other country residents per capita for countries making reductions,
yet other appeals to equal costs per capita for countries making costs. We also consider
transfers from richer developed countries that compensate poorer developing countries for
losses incurred by them when taking on climate policies commitments. These losses can be
thought of as forgone development opportunities for them from emission countries
limitations.
We use numerical simulation methods and our results show sharp departures in country
impacts from the equi proportional reductions discussed thus far in UNFCCC negotiations,
and produce a wide range of outcomes. From these results we draw the conclusion that the
bargaining set for the post Kyoto, post 2012, post Durban process is likely large. This
continues to point to a complex and difficult to conclude negotiation.

2. Cross country fairness and the post Durban process for a global climate regime
Appealing to fairness considerations in the ways in which Post Kyoto Climate change
policy regime evolves will likely be a central element in the discussions to follow after the
Durban meeting in December 2011 and the end of the Kyoto period of reductions. The aim of
negotiations had been to agree a global policy regime to follow on after in 2012 from the
earlier 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Only a minimal platform agreement resulted from this process in
the 2009 Copenhagen accords. Further progress seemingly involves the resolution of a series
of issues which were not touched on in any depth in Copenhagen and subsequent meetings,
but which directly follow from arguments involving fairness or justice cross countries.
These include emissions reductions based on annual versus cumulative emissions, the
allocation on a per capita basis of a global constraint on emissions consistent with a
temperature change target and how historical emissions enter such allocations. Also arising
are the interpretation of the Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR)
commitment in the UNFCCC for developing countries; the use of a consumption or
production basis for emissions reductions; the use of level or intensity targets for emissions
3

reductions; the choice of a base date for calculating reductions; the length of commitment
period; the depth of cut and the implied temperature change target; the form and size of
accompanying

financial arrangements; and the allowable use of accompanying border

adjustments.
In Copenhagen and subsequent UNFCCC meetings and the run up to them, these issues
were not centrally discussed, but they remain key to the emergence of any agreed post Kyoto
global climate framework. Justice or fairness notions in debates on resolution of these issues
can be made in abstract form largely independently of the constraints implied by agreements
already entered into the UNFCCC; or can be applied considering the constraints over the
bargaining set already agreed to in a form of prior agenda formulation negotiations. Here we
link to cross country fairness agreements, putting other dimensions of fairness (such as
intergenerational equity) on one side.
Justice in economic decision making is one of the perennial themes in philosophy (ethics)
tracing back at least to Aristotle, and there is a large amount of work which can be drawn on
among which Rawls (1971) is perhaps one of the best known. In Rawls's, justice theory
condenses into two key theorems. One is the difference rule, which implies maximizing the
well-being of the worst off member of society. Applying this to the post Kyoto negotiation
process (using Beitz's (1979) corollary of Rawls' justice in the international sense), one could
argue for justice based arrangements on two levels. On the first, those countries most
vulnerable to climate changes should be compensated for damage incurred but not caused
their own emissions. This could take the form of exemptions for cost burdens of global
policies to combat climate changes in the future. On a second level, the developing world as
a whole claim compensation in the long run for combating climate change, via financial aid
and subsidized clean energy technology transfer from the developed world to offset forgone
development.
More recent economics literature also contributes to justice debates using new
formulations. A central issue is the definition of fairness. At the heart of these analyses is a
description of a stable state as one in which no one is willing to change his own wealth
(consumption) by changing positions with others, i.e., relative fairness. Using to this relative
fairness concept, Fehr and Schmidt (1999) define a utility function for climate change
4

embedded with fairness. Fairness in this case is defined as an unfairness aversion coefficient
times the minimum of the difference between what the agent and his peer in society are
offered, and zero. The discussion of this in Kirman (1999) seemingly rejects the
equiproportional burden-sharing mechanisms of the Kyoto process and suggests that
developed and developing countries should not be treated on the same basis, since the
implied initial allocation of usable atmosphere for development is unfair.
We use four alternative notions of cross countries fairness in model based analyses of
the potential impacts of alternative emissions reductions proposals and financial transfers.
One is to allocate scare atmospheric capacity in meeting targets for global temperature
change on an equal per capita basis across countries. This can be done either on the basis of
remaining atmospheric capacity at a point in time, or on the basis of remaining capacity net
of historical usage by countries. Another is to use country reductions which yield benefits to
other countries such that the costs per capita for countries making the reductions are the
same. One can also consider the financial transfers between developed and developing
countries under each approach which compensates developing countries for forgone
development opportunities due to emission reductions.
In an earlier paper, Tian and Whalley (2010) used equilibrium computational methods
to analyze the country and global impacts of post Kyoto proposed multilateral emission
reductions, accompanying financial transfers and trade based measures reflecting actual
proposals made during negotiation. There was an 8 country calibrated equilibrium structure
which used a base data of 2006 out to either 2020 or 2030 as a single BAU base period and
with climate change benefits captured directly in preferences. Their results indicated large
country variation in country impacts of alternative equiproportional reduction formula (such
as using annual or cumulative emissions), as well as the need for significant financial
transfers to non OECD countries (China, India, Brazil) to induce their participation. They also
explored the role which could be played indirectly by the use of trade measures by OECD
countries against non participant (presumably non OECD) countries.
We use a similar calibrated equilibrium model to analyze the impacts of alternative
emission reductions, financial transfers, and border measures based on the alternative
notions of fairness indicated above. We discuss what these alternative approaches suggest
5

for country participation in three components of global environmental negotiations:
mitigation, adaptation (financial transfers), and trade measures. As we sequentially apply
these alternative notions, what emerges is that the bargaining set for the Post Copenhagen
negotiation seems ever widening, highlighting further the large difficulties in concluding a
global climate negotiation. The precise size and dimensions of the bargaining set remain
inevitably highly uncertain due to the further ambiguities of which analytical construct to use
to analyze the potential countries or region impacts of emissions reductions as well as the
ambiguities of which functional forms and parameter values to use in judging alternative
outcomes.
In performing our analyses we adopt of a target for global climate change regime not to
exceed 2 degree temperature change by 2050. Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) suggest there is no specific temperature threshold for dangerous
climate change, and negative effects are gradually increasing, but over one hundred
countries have adopted this “2°C target”. Two recent studies by a group of German, Swiss and
British researchers in the journal Nature (Meinshausen et al. 2009, Allen et al. 2009) also
suggest that, to contain global warming, and its risks and consequences, warming related to
pre-industrial times (pre 1900) should not exceed two degrees Celsius. These two studies
published in Nature suggest that from 2000 to 2050 in meeting a 2℃ target, a maximum of
1000 billion tones of CO2 may be emitted into the atmosphere. Around one third of this has
already been emitted. If emission remains at current levels, or even increase, the global
emissions budget would be exhausted by 20302. These calculations suggest that the time to
act remains short and cross country fairness considerations seemingly must inevitably enter
the debate on how to do it.

3. A Modeling Framework for the Evaluation of the Impacts of Cross Country
Fairness Considerations in Post 2012 Emissions Reduction Arrangements
To analyze the potential impacts of the various alternative global arrangements based
on fairness considerations, we have adapted a modeling framework used earlier by Cai,
2

Nordhaus (2010) reports similar results: his cumulative emissions target for 2055 is 376.73 GTC (equivalent
1382.60 billion tones of CO2) for limiting global warning to 2C.
6

Riezman, and Whalley (2009) and Tian and Whalley(2010) to analyze linkages between trade,
trade policy and climate change arrangements under Kyoto type arrangements. Here we
elaborate on this framework and use it to evaluate the impacts of alternative potential
emissions reductions which take fairness into account. We focus on impacts on the large
population rapidly growing developing economies of China, India, Russia and Brazil. We also
explore the impacts of border taxes, tariffs, and/or transfers as part of equity motivated
packages.

3.1 Modelling Temperature Change and Top Level Country Utility Functions
We analyze a single period of a number of years during which each of a number of large
national economies is assumed to grow at a constant compounding rate3. Each country in the
period is assumed to be able to consume or export one country heterogeneous good whose
potential consumption (or use) grows at this rate in the base case. We assume that
consumption of the good either by the country directly or by others through trade generates
emissions of carbon which in turn raise global temperature. Countries have an upper bound
on the use of their own good reflecting a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario. If they use
(consume or export) less than the upper bound, they experience less temperature change as
do all other countries. Countries receive positive utility from consumption, but negative
utility from temperature change. Countries export their own good and import other country
goods. If countries are small, their own actions have little or no effect on temperature change.
The amount of resources needed to be put aside to achieve given reductions reflects
abatement cost estimates.
As we later work with the impacts of agreements which reduce carbon emissions over a
given period of time, we use a single period from 2012 out to 2020, 2030 or 2050. These
reflect possible commitment periods for a global agreement on a post 2012 regime. In this
multi year period, we focus on changes in consumption (use of own and foreign goods) and

3

Because the model uses a single period, discounting does not formally enter the analytic structure. Discounting
does, however, arise with the use of a discount rate in calculating the discounted present value of GDP over the
model period. We consider cases with a common discount rate of 1% across all countries in sensitivity analysis,
since the growth rates of key OECD countries (EU, Japan) are low. See also the discussion of discounting and
climate change policy in Weitzman (2007) and Dasgupta (2008), and the key role discounting plays in the
conclusions of the Stern (2006) report.
7

utility, and measure changes in these variables relative to the outcome of zero growth over
the period. We report changes in utility in money metric (Hicksian) form in US$ amounts.
The utility impacts of possible reduction agreements for each country over the period is
reflected in a utility change function relative to utility under zero growth, with arguments
given by the own country change in a composite of consumption as well as the temperature
change of the world. The utility function is thus defined over multiyear changes in
consumption and temperature. The potential use of each country good thus reflects changes
in potential output from the economy over the same period.
We first analyze a business as usual (BAU) scenario which assumes current observed
growth rates remaining unchanged over the model period, and with no global or single
country emissions limitation initiatives in place. We initially assume the utility change
function for each country has the form

 H  T 
U  U (Ci , T )  Ci *  (
)
H


i



(1)

In this specification, ΔCi represents the change in consumption for each country i over
the period. This is a composite of their own good and other country’s goods which they
acquire by importing other country’s goods and exporting their own good. This provides a
link between trade, tariffs and emission reduction incentives which we use to also explore
the possible impacts of accompanying trade measures for a post 2012 arrangement.
In this, H can be thought of the global temperature change at which all economic
activity ceases (say 20℃). As ΔT approaches H, utility change goes to zero and ΔT goes to
zero and there is no welfare impact of temperature change. Utility change over any model
period increases as temperature change falls.
The share parameter β determines the severity of damage (in utility terms) from any
given temperature change. We later calibrate the model to various damage estimates from
business as usual global temperature change reported by Stern (2006) and Mendelsohn
(2007), and this procedure determines β. For simplicity, we assume β is the same value
across countries.
Global temperature change, in turn, is determined by the change in carbon emissions
over the period across all countries in the model. We adopt a simple global temperature
8

change function and assume that emissions by each country equal the change in
consumption times country emissions intensity (emissions/GDP) so as to allow for differing
emissions intensities by country. Defining the emissions intensity of country i as ei, we use a
power function (2) to capture global temperature change due to changes in emissions by all
countries over the model period.

T  g ( ei Si )  a( ei Si )b  c
i

(2)

i

where ΔSi represents the change in the use (consumption plus exports) of the own good
for each country i.4 In the central case formulation of the model, ei is exogenous and fixed
at its 2006 base case level. Consumption of each country good by all countries is less than or
equal to ΔSi; and ΔSi is less than or equal to the upper bound Si associated with the base
case scenario since countries can choose whether to participate in emission reductions
initiatives. The typical scenario we consider is where countries in the model can commit to
emission reductions which are a given percentage of their Si . We also conduct sensitivity
analyses in which the ei change over time to reflect increased efficiency of energy use over
time. Finally we consider accompanying trade and finance mechanisms under which
developing countries have the option of joining a negotiated percentage reduction (and also
possibly receiving transfers) or not joining and forgoing the transfer(and possibly facing
border adjustments and/or tariffs).

3.2 Composite consumption by country
In this model structure, a carbon reduction commitment by a single country implies a
reduction in composite consumption (a composite of the country specific goods reflecting
international trade), and this has both negative and positive effects on utility change for all
countries over the model period. On the one hand, a reduction in consumption lowers utility
for the consuming country. But on the other hand, country consumption reductions lower
global emissions and hence world temperature change, and increases the utility both of the

4

Ideally, this power function should have the property that there is increasing marginal impact on temperature
change for progessive increases in consumption, i.e., b > 1. We however calibrate this function to estimates of

temperature change of 3 C by 2030 and 5 C by 2050 given in the Stern (2006) report, which jointly implies b < 1.

country reducing emissions and all other countries.
The composite consumption good Ci is a CES function of domestic and imported
consumption goods, similar to that used in nested CES Armington trade models (see Whalley
(1985)). The model is thus effectively an Armington N good N country pure trade economy in
which the endowment is variable.
The Ci are determined by solving the country optimization problems.

The composition of M i is determined by a third level of nesting in the model, and

given by sales of own good Si at the world price pi . Unlike in a conventional Armington
trade model, Si is endogenous and also the outcome of a discrete choice optimization
problem involving participation or non participation in proposal climate change agreements.

3.3 Composites of Imported Goods
The CES import composites M i are composites of imported goods from each
supplying country. Given that each country has one good it can sell, but N-1 goods it imports,

We use the same central case settings of elasticities as Cai, Riezman and Whalley (2009) of

(11)

The Si take on the values Si in the base case and one of two values in
counterfactual analyses. Si can be the implied reduction in Si for countries meeting
emissions reduction commitments. Alternatively, Si is equal to Si for non OECD
countries if they do not participate.
In this structure, when countries participate in a global climate agreement, if they
reduce emissions by reducing GDP there will be general equilibrium implications for all prices
and quantities. Importantly, if there are accompanying mechanisms, tariffs against countries
will cause the price of their own good i to fall giving a terms of trade loss for the country not
making the emissions reduction. This will, in turn, increase the willingness of countries to
11

participate in global emission reductions negotiations. Transfers do not exert this direct term
of trade effect through a relative price intervention, but as countries receiving transfers
spend most of their income on their own good, in the calibrated Armington structure a terms
of trade effect will come into play through income effects.

3.5 Costs of Mitigation
A further element in the model is the cost of mitigating damage from climate change
through emission reduction, or abatement costs. We capture these in a simple mitigation
cost function where country mitigation costs are a linear constant marginal cost function of
use of own good (consumption plus export). Stern (2006) places these costs at 1% of GDP±
3% for a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050. We use a central case estimate of 2.5% and
then use sensitivity ranges for this key parameter. The mitigation (abatement) cost function
is;

MCi  

(Ei  Ei )
Si
Ei

(12)

where MCi are the mitigation costs of country i for emissions mitigation of an amount
given by ( Ei (base case) - Ei (new emission)). Ei are the new emissions implied by

the reduction and Ei are the emissions changes along the BAU path.
thus the proportional change in emissions.

(Ei  Ei )
is
Ei

 is the emission reduction cost factor linking

the proportional change in emissions to use of resources. We set

 equal to 0.025 in the

base case, and conduct sensitivity analysis with parameter values of 0.01 and 0.04.

3.6 Incorporating Alternative Cross Country Fairness Based Approaches to Global
Emissions Reductions
We use the model to analyze different counterfactuals relative to the BAU scenario and
these reflect the various fairness approaches to emission reductions. As discussed earlier one
is that from the global capacity constraint on emissions implied by a temperature change
target (say 2℃) that the emissions to be allocated on an equal per capita basis. These
12

allocations may or may not take into account historical emissions by country. Another is that
the temperature change benefit to other countries created through a country's emission
reduction (net of abatement costs) should be equallised per capita globally. Yet another is to
allow for equal per capita costs to countries making emission reductions. Developing
countries can also be compensated (as agreed under CBDR) for forgone development via
financial transfers; or domestic producers in participating countries can be compensated via a
setting of trade measures for loss of competitiveness due to non participation in global
climate policy by non joining parties.
In doing this, the model can be extended to capture border tax adjustments, tariffs, and
financial transfers as penalties or inducements to participate in negotiations. The size of
transfers, either as a percentage of recipient country GDP or of donating country GDP, or as
an amount in $ transferred from developed countries is taken as exogenous, but can be
varied in sensitivity analyses. Tariffs and border adjustments apply to the prices of goods
crossing national borders and generate revenues and are considered in Tian and
Whalley(2010). Trade imbalances (including transfers) are exogenous in the model.

4. Data and Model Calibration
We calibrate the model set out above both to a temperature change function for
prospective changes in temperature under business as usual scenarios out to 2020, 2030 and
2050 and to preferences given damage estimates for climate change in a BAU scenario. These
time periods correspond to possible commitment periods in a potential global agreement. We
construct a BAU growth profile using forward projections of 2006 data, and model calibration to
this profile determines key model parameters. In performing these calibrations we use varying
estimates of associated damage in the ranges reported by Stern (2006) and Mendelsohn (2007)
and abatement cost estimates as in Stern (2006). We use an 8 country grouping, of Brazil, Russia,
India, China, US, EU, Japan, and the Rest of the World (ROW).

4.1 The Base Case Scenario Data Sources
We use GDP growth as the measure of change in potential consumption by country over
13

the various periods of analysis. China, India, Russia, Brazil, USA, EU, Japan and the Rest of the
World (Row) are assumed to have BAU growth rates of 0.09, 0.07, 0.07, 0.032 0.026, 0.020, 0.17,
and 0.30 respectively, given by average growth rates of 2000 to 2006 (data from World Bank
website). We then use the BAU growth path data to calibrate the temperature change function
using estimated BAU temperature change estimate over the period from key literature sources,
including Stern (2006) and Mendelsohn (2007). This implies that in high growth scenarios
emissions are larger and also temperature change is higher.
Table 1 reports the 2006 output and emissions data used in our period projections for the
base case, and the growth rates used. Preferences towards goods and temperature change are
determined for each country using alternative damage estimates from the same sources.

4.2 Calibration of Model Parameters
In calibration, we use data on consumption and trade for OECD and non-OECD economies
along with country growth profiles and various damage and temperature change assumptions as
business as usual (BAU) scenarios. We undertake numerical investigation with our analytical
14

structure using calibration to determine model parameters values followed by counterfactual
analyses of various forms. The base data we use are for 3 different periods 2006-2030 and
2006-2050 with assumed yearly growth rates over the period.
We first discuss the calibration of preference parameters. According to the Stern Review
(2005), Mendelssohn (2006) and other literature, on BAU paths the damage costs from emissions
range from 1 to 20% of GDP out to 2050. We treat damage from climate change in the model as
utility change of the same proportion over the same time and use it to calibrate the preference
parameters in the model.
Without temperature change, the utility change function is:

U i*  Ci

(13)

And with damage we have :

U i* / U i  (

H  T 
)
H

(14)

With temperature change, there will thus be a utility change loss from damage. We can
thus calibrate  using equation (14) above for given different values of H. For illustrative
purposes, in Table 2 we report calibrated  values for a time period of 50 years as the base case.
In our simulation analysis, we use H=10 as the base case, and perform sensitivity analysis with
H=20 and H=30.
The temperature change function is written as a function of emission changes over the
same period, and we treat it as a power function of total emission (not output) change for the
world. Based on the discussion in Stern (2006), we assume the BAU path of emissions will lead to
about 3 degree temperature increase around the year 2030, and near to 5 degrees by around
2050. For simplicity, we assume that zero growth in the global economy will lead to no
temperature change.
T  a( Ei )b

(15)

i

With data on growth rates and emission intensities for each country under the BAU growth
scenarios, we can then calibrate the parameters a and b. We have data for year 2006 and
projections of emissions and output data for 2030 and 2050. We choose 2006 as the base year,
and assume that 25 years later, that is by 2030, the global average temperature will increase by 3
degrees, and 5 degrees by 2050. We assume that the BAU path implies output growth for each
15

country comparable to that of 2000-2006, while emission intensities are unchanged from the
year 2006. Table 2 reports the calibrated values of a and b.6
We are able to relax these assumptions to allow for autonomous (exogenous)
improvements in energy efficiency (intensity) over time.

5. Model Results

We analyze the implications of alternative cross country fairness considerations entering
multicounty emissions reductions by first calibrating our model to our base period BAU scenario
data for the single period 2006-2050, and then performing counterfactual experiments which
incorporate a series of alternative emissions reductions. Each of these captures different fairness
approaches and arrangements.
Table 5.1 sets out the base case (BAU) projected cumulative emissions by country as well as
the emissions implied by each of four cross country fairness approaches and uniform
equiproportional reductions in annual emissions for comparative purposes. These are then each
applied in the model as a scenario in which the global emission reduction is that projected as

Given the Stern estimates, b < 1 which implies diminishing not increasing impacts of growing consumption on
temperature change.

required to meet a global temperature change target of 2℃. BAU cumulative emissions globally
for the period 2006-2050 are 7935.86 equivalent of carbon. To meet a 2℃ temperature change
target globally, we adopt the target from Nordhaus (2010) of 376.73 billions of metric tons of
carbon7 (equivalent 1382.60 billion metric tons of CO2 ) for limiting global warning to 2C.
We use alternative country allocation schemes based on the fairness considerations
discussed in the earlier sections of the paper to calculate implied emission reductions reported in
Table 3 as follow:
a) That the global emissions target and emissions allocation by country is based on an
equal per capita allocation of absorptive capacity in the atmosphere across the world.
These are calculated both with and without emissions of historical responsibility for
emissions.
b) That the emission allocation instead is one where the benefits to other countries than
the country making the cuts are equal on a per capita basis for the country making the
cuts.
c) That the costs to countries making the cuts are equal on a per capita basis. We also
consider cases where there are financial transfers between developed and developing
countries.
Table 3 reports differences in the country allocation of emissions reductions among these
approaches. The uniform equi-proportional cut is that implied by Table 1 to meet the target of a
2℃ change in temperature by 2050. The equal per capita capacity cuts are those giving equal
emissions per person across all countries consistent with the same target. These calculations are
made both taking account of emissions by country prior to 2012, and not taking these into
account. Equal per capita benefit allocations involve model calculations of benefits to other
countries of reduction divided by populations of other countries. Equal burden per capita for
reductions calculates money metric utility costs divided by the populations of the country making
the cuts. These reductions vary greatly both by country and for some countries across cases. The
high growth rates for China compounded out to 2050 account for their large shares of reductions.
On an equal emissions capacity per capita basis, these range from 33.61% for Brazil to 98.85% for
Russia. Total world population is 8752.25 million, and total world cumulative emissions are
7

Nordhaus uses GTC as the units, which are the same as billions of metric tons of carbon.
17

9440.82, with an average emission per person in the world of 1.079. Considering the large
population in the future and the small emission stock in history, China and India, receive more
space to emit (17.64% and 20.46% of the total in Table 5.1), while Russia receives only 0.41% due
to its small population in 2050.
These distributions are reversed when the alternative fairness criteria are applied. When
equal per capita benefits are used, the per capita contributions to the world of China, India,
Russia, Brazil, USA, EU, Japan and the Rest of the World (Row) are separately 0,005, 0,0057,
0.0832, 0.0655, 0.0171, 0.0258, 0.1118 and 0.0017. Japan is given more emission space due to its
high per capita benefit contribution to the world. When equal per capita burdens are considered,
per capita costs of China, India, Russia, Brazil, USA, EU, Japan and the Rest of the World (Row) are
separately 0.0028, 0.0052, 0.0480, 0.1622, 0.0731, 0.1477, 0.5072 and 0.0030. Japan again is
given more emission space due to its high per capita burden.
In Table 3, due to both China and US’s dominant carbon emission position in the long run
(almost half of the world), how emission targets are allocated has limited impact on these two
countries’ potential emissions reduction commitments. Both need to cut around 95% under the
various allocation assumptions. These do, however, have different impacts on other developed
countries, including EU and Japan and other emerging economies’ reduction commitments
(including India, Brazil and Russia). For example, when allocated emission targets are set in terms
of equal per capita emission capacity for the world, India and Brazil’s reduction targets contract
by nearly half (compared to the other two forms of allocation). When the emission targets are
allocated in terms of equal per capita benefit for the world, Russia and Japan benefit with more
emission space allocated, while India and Brazil lose, and China, US and EU are negatively
affected. When equal per capita burdens are considered as the basis to allocate emission
targets, almost all BRIC countries lose, and most developed countries benefit, except for the US.

In Table 4 we report model calculations of the welfare impacts of emissions reductions based
on equal per capita allocations of atmosphere absorptive capacity across regions. These are
calculated both with and without adjustments for historical responsibility. These are money
metric measures in US$ for the period 2012-2050. Relative to eqiproportional reductions, welfare
impacts over the commitments periods change sharply using these fairness criteria. Significant
gains for the US and EU under uniform eqiproportional reductions become significant losses.
Losses for China increases further, and small losses for India, and Brazil become significant gains.
Differences with history considerations added are small since the majority of emissions out to
2050 occur after 2006.

Table 5 reports the welfare impacts by country for reductions over the period 2006-2050
based on equal per capita benefits and equal per capita burdens with the equiproportional
20

reductions case again reported for comparative purpose. Losses for China increase, with a similar
outcome for India and Russia. Japan is a large gainer in all cases. We report Hicksian equivalent
variations in $trillion, and also report these as a % of BAU base case discounted income between
2006 and 2050.

Table 6 reports model calculations of the required financial transfers to the different larger
developing countries in the model needed as to compensate them for any losses incurred when
undertaking the emissions reductions set out in Table 3. The financial transfers to China of nearly
$11 trillion exceed the negative welfare impacts in Table 3, since the welfare impacts include the
money metric equivalent welfare gain through preferences from temperature change reduction.

Table 8 reports model results which show the impacts of changing the basis for calculating
emissions reductions from production of emissions to emissions implied by consumption under
each of the fairness criteria. The impacts are small for most regions, except for the US where the
trade imbalance is large.
Finally Table 9 reports sensitivity analyses for the results in Table 3. These involve alternative
settings for underlying BAU scenario assumptions and model parameters. We report impacts of
changes in assumed energy efficiency improvement growth rates, assumed discount rates,
assumed utility damage from climate change in the BAU case, and also the use of PPP measures
to calibrate base case GDP and income over the period 2006-2050. The latter imply large
differences in the data used to represent the relative size of China and India and impacts for
these countries change accordingly. Results also indicate potential significant sensitivity in results
when damage and discount rate parameters vary.

6 Concluding Remarks
Negotiations on a global climate policy regime to follow on after the Kyoto Protocol in 2012
represent a size and form of social engineering on a global scale way beyond anything previously
attempted in trade and finance. As such they will inevitably be difficult to conclude in a single
comprehensive effort. The UNFCCC process has made the successful conclusion of these
negotiations even more problematic by first restricting negotiations to relatively similar
developed countries in Kyoto, and then attempting to add poorer countries with divergent
characteristics in a second stage. These range from fast growing large manufacturing based
economics, such as China, to poor low growth economies in Africa. Not surprising a
homogeneous treatment faces difficulties in achieving consensus.
Here we use a calibrated global model of consumption, production and trade with climate
change entering preferences to investigate the potential differing impacts of alternative
approaches to these negotiations based on fairness arguments used to allocate country emissions
reductions. Due to China and the US’s dominant carbon emission position in the long run, how
emission targets are allocated has limited impact on these two countries’ potential emission
reduction commitments, but they do have potentially sharply impacts both on other developed
countries, including EU and Japan and other emerging economies commitments (including India,
Brazil and Russia). Equal per capita allocations of emission capacity hurts the US and the EU
relative to proportional cuts, and also hurts China in the BAU scenario due to China’s
compounding growth out to 2050. When equal per capita burdens are considered as the basis
to allocate emission targets, most BRIC countries lose, and most developed countries benefit,
except for the US.

These levels suggest larger differences in impacts, and hence that fairness

debate on country emissions reductions allocations will continue. If damage is predicted to
increase sharply, so that joint gains for negotiations increase, then more progress may occur.
