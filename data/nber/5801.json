To achieve the objectives of this study, we have developed a framework that integrates several strands of the available approaches in the literature: the GNP function approach suggested by Burgess (1974) and Kohli (1978), the spillover models proposed by Bernstein and Nadiri (1988), Bernstein and Mohnen (1994), Coe and Helpman (1995) and Park (1995), and the familiar interrelated factor demand and cost models.\n\n",
