Theory and Evidence on Employer Collusion in the Franchise Sector

ABSTRACT
In this paper we study the role of covenants in franchise contracts that restrict the recruitment and
hiring of employees from other units within the same franchise chain in suppressing competition
for workers. Based on an analysis of 2016 Franchise Disclosure Documents, we find that "nopoaching of workers agreements" are included in a surprising 58 percent of major franchisors'
contracts, including McDonald's, Burger King, Jiffy Lube and H&R Block. The implications of
these no-poaching agreements for models of oligopsony are also discussed. No-poaching
agreements are more common for franchises in low-wage and high-turnover industries.

Notes: Mean of dependent variable is 0.58. Franchise chain share is total of franchisor's units as a
percent of the number of establishments in 6‐ digit NAICS industry. Industry‐Franchise Share is percent
of workers in 6‐ digit NAICS industry employed by a franchise. New hire rate is percentage of workers in
industry with 1 year or less of tenure. Standard errors allow for clustering at the two‐digit CPS industry
level.
