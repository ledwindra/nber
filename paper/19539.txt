Measuring the Accuracy of Survey Responses using Administrative Register Data: Evidence
from Denmark

NBER Working Paper No. 19539

JEL No. C42,D31
ABSTRACT
This paper shows how Danish administrative register data can be combined with survey data at the
person level and be used to validate information collected in the survey. Register data are collected
by automatic third party reporting and the potential errors associated with the two data sources are
therefore plausibly orthogonal. Two examples are given to illustrate the potential of combining survey
and register data. In the first example expenditure survey records with information about total expenditure
are merged with income tax records holding information about income and wealth. Income and wealth
data are used to impute total expenditure which is then compared to the survey measure. Results suggest
that the two measures match each other well on average. In the second example we compare responses
to a one-shot recall question about total gross personal income (collected in another survey) with tax
records. Tax records hold detailed information about different types of income and this makes it possible
to test if errors in the survey response are related to the reporting of particular types of income. Results
show bias in the mean and that the survey error has substantial variance. Results also show that the
errors are correlated with conventional covariates suggesting that the errors are not of the classical
type. The latter example illustrates how Denmark can be used as a “laboratory” for future validation
studies. Tax records with detailed information about different types of income are available for the
entire Danish population and can be readily merged to survey data. This makes it possible to test the
ability of respondents to accurately report different types of income using different interviewing techniques
and questions. The examples presented in this paper are based on cross section data. However, the
possibility to issue surveys repeatedly to the same persons and linking up to longitudinal tax records
provides an opportunity to learn more about the time series properties of measurement errors, a subject
about which little evidence exist, in the future.

1. Introduction
Danish administrative register data can readily be combined at the person level with survey data. This
makes it possible to compare survey based measures directly with corresponding measures based on
information from administrative registers. Because register information is collected by third‐party
automatic reporting and completely independently from the survey collection we believe this provides
an inexpensive and powerful way to validate survey measures.
The objective of this paper is to illustrate how Danish register and survey data may be combined at the
person or household level and used for validating measures collected by survey, and we illustrate the
potential of this methodology by two examples. In the first example we use administrative records
about disposable income and wealth to validate the total expenditure measure collected in the Danish
family expenditure survey. In the second example we use third party reported information about gross
personal income from the income‐tax register to validate a survey measure of gross personal income.
Validating total expenditure requires assumptions as the register measure of total expenditure is itself
ridden with error. The most important assumption is that the errors of the two measures are
uncorrelated. This is not likely to be a restrictive assumption since the data are collected from
completely independent sources. We find that total expenditure from the expenditure survey is mean
unbiased, but noisy.
In the second example, where we validate survey information about gross income, the register
measure of gross personal income is collected entirely from third‐party automatically reported
information. This is thought to be very close to the “truth” and the validation exercise therefore relies
on few assumptions. We find that survey answers are noisy and mean biased. We also compare our
results about the magnitude of income mismeasurement with the results from Bound et al 1994 .
They compared survey responses with payroll data from a single US manufacturing company where
workers are homogenous and received regular and well‐defined payments. Consistent with our
broader income measure and broader sample, we find larger errors than the study by Bound et al.
The methodology presented in this paper is simple but powerful. In the Danish context, it is possible to
match survey and register data for any subsample of the population and it can be done at relatively
low costs. In this way Denmark can be thought of as a “laboratory” for very detailed and focused
validation studies to investigate the impact of survey methodology on the accuracy of survey
responses so as to optimize the survey methodology across different groups and balancing this with
survey costs.1 It is possible for international researchers or statistical agencies to conduct new studies

1 Reducing measurement error is the primary mission of the Gemini project. The Gemini Project Vision Document

initiatives to reduce measurement error should be balanced with the potential negative effects on response rates.

on Danish data through collaboration with researchers based in Denmark or directly with Statistics
Denmark if necessary funding is available.
The next section outlines the Danish institutional setup facilitating the collection of administrative
register data and the merging of register and survey records. Section 3 outlines the analytical
framework that we use to asses the importance of measurement error in the survey data. Section 4
shows how income‐tax records with information about income, tax payments and wealth have been
used to impute a measure of total household expenditure that is then matched at the household level
to data from the Danish expenditure survey in order to check how well the total expenditure measure
in the survey matches the register based imputation. The analysis presented in that section
complements the analysis presented in Browning and Leth‐Petersen 2003 and is based on the same
data. In section 5 we combine income‐tax records with new survey data containing a measure of total
gross personal income to directly validate the survey measure of gross income. Section 6 sums up and
discusses the possibilities for future validation studies based on combining Danish register and survey
data.

2. Matching administrative register data with survey data
All persons in Denmark are assigned a unique personal identification number CPR . This number is
used by all government institutions to store person specific information including information
relevant for taxation, for example the information contained in tax returns, but also information about
car ownership, contacts to the health care system, the educational system, and about family
composition and place of residence, allowing for the construction of household units. Many
administrative registers, including population registers and income tax registers, are collected by
Statistics Denmark which merges them and provides access to researchers working at authorized
Danish research institutions. The data are confidential, are kept on servers at Statistics Denmark, and
are accessed under comprehensive security precautions. The data must be kept at the servers and only
aggregated numbers such as regression coefficients can be extracted.
The register data have many outstanding features, but the features most important in this context are
that they covers the entire population and contains tax records with third party reported information
about income and wealth. In this study we shall rely on register data from the income tax registers to
validate survey information about spending and income. The income‐tax register is collected by the
tax authorities in order to calculate the amount of taxes to be paid by all persons in Denmark by the
end of each calendar year. The tax authorities collect information from many sources. Most important
for this study are earnings and employers’ pension contributions collected directly from employers,
3

information about transfer income from government institutions, and information about interest
payments/income and the value of assets and liabilities by the end of the year collected directly from
banks. A recent study by Kleven et al. 2011 conducted a large scale randomized tax auditing
experiment in collaboration with the Danish tax authorities and documents that tax evasion in
Denmark is very limited, in particular among wage earners. This means that the third party reported
income information collected by the tax authorities is of very high quality.
The tax authorities use the information for different purposes. Information about earnings and capital
income is preprinted on the tax return, whereas wealth information is used to cross check if reported
income is consistent with the level of asset accumulation from one year to the next. While the tax
authorities collects this information at a high level of detail corresponding to individual entries at the
tax return for income and at the account level for wealth, this information is in some cases transferred
to Statistics Denmark’s research database as summary variables only; for example, we observe the
sum of earnings from different employers, and for some capital income sub‐components only net
income is available. In addition to covering the entire population and being based on third party
reported information, the income‐tax registers also have the attractive features that income and
wealth information is not top coded and that longitudinal information can be retrieved as far back as
1980 for some variables.
A crucial feature for the present purpose is that it is possible to link to survey data via the CPR
number. Matching surveys with register data is done at relatively low cost; for example, the survey
used in the second part of this paper consists of 40 questions, was was carried out as telephone
interviews and includes 6,000 completed interviews. The sample was randomized from the population
based on register data covering the entire population, and the survey data was merged on to register
data after collection. The total costs were about 200,000 USD.2

3. Analytical framework
There are several ways of summarizing the accuracy of the survey data. In this paper we focus on the
magnitude of the attenuation bias in OLS regressions of the register measure on the survey measure.
The analytical setup is a generalization of the setup presented by Bound and Krueger 1991 .
Consider

A number of survey agencies are specialized in conducting surveys and linking to administrative register data. Two of those
are SFI survey http://www.sfi.dk/Default.aspx?ID 2832 and Epinion www.epinion.dk who have collected the survey
used in example 2. Also Statistics Denmark www.dst.dk conduct surveys that can subsequently be merged on to register
data.

where z S is the observed survey based measure, z * is the true but unobserved measure, and u S is the
survey measurement error. Correspondingly, z R is the observed register based measure, and u R is the
register measurement error. All variables are measured in natural logarithms.3 This amounts to
assuming that the measurement error is multiplicative in levels. Subscripts identifying that each
observation of

z , z
*

R

, z S , u R , u S  pertains to an individual are suppressed. In the case of gross

income, we believe that the register based measure is very close to the “truth”, while this is obviously
not the case in the other example, where we compare total expenditure from survey data with imputed
measures from the register data.
Assume

cov  z * , u R   0

 A.1

cov  u S , u R   0

 A.2 

A.1 assumes that the error of the register measure is uncorrelated with the true level. This
assumption is not testable with the data used in this paper and may in some cases be a reasonable
assumption while in others it may not. For example, it could be that people with a low level of true
income have different errors than people with a high level of true income because they have different
cognitive skills that influence the quality of their answer or have total income consisting of different
subcomponents and different complexity, or because low level income people have different amounts
of undeclared income. Similarly, in the case of total expenditure, consumers with a high level of
expenditures are likely to have total expenditure consisting of different types of consumption than
consumers with a low level of expenditures, and this may give rise to different measurement errors if
subcomponents of total expenditure have different errors. Because we assume that the measurement
error is multiplicative in levels, we do allow for the level of errors being larger at high levels than at
low levels of income/total expenditure, but this is entirely determined by the logarithmic functional
form that we employ in the applications. A.2 assumes that the error of the survey measure is
uncorrelated with the error of the register measure. This seems to be a reasonable assumption in both
of the examples as will be discussed in connection with each example.

The analytical framework, of course, does not require that the variables are measured in logarithms.

Consider a regression of z R on the true but unobserved measure z * :

z R   0  1 z *  u R

3

Now substitute in the survey measure for the true measure

z R   0  1 z S  u R  1u S

4

Using A.1 and A.2 the probability limit of the OLS estimator of 1 can be written

p lim 1  1

var  z S  is just the OLS regression of the register measure on the survey

measure. The bias due to the measurement error in the survey measure is then 1    .
Maintaining assumption A.1 and A.2 this expression covers the case with classical measurement error
where u S are iid and    u2S

 but is not limited to this special case. In particular, the

present framework is more general since it allows for cases where the errors are not iid .

Example 1: Total Expenditure
Total expenditure is one of the most important variables collected in expenditure surveys and this
variable is central to numerous studies of demand and intertemporal consumption allocation.
However, there is little evidence on the quality of the information collected in expenditure surveys. In
Denmark it is possible to link the household level information from the Danish Family expenditure
survey to administrative income tax records including third party reported information about income
and wealth that can be used to impute total expenditure.

4.1 data
The sample used consists of the households entering the Danish Family expenditure survey DES
1994‐1996. The households in this survey have been contacted at different times of the year so that
6

observations are distributed across the calendar year. Each household has participated in a
comprehensive interview, where they have answered questions about purchases of durables within
the past 12 months from the interview date. Furthermore, each household has kept a diary for two
weeks, where they have kept a detailed account of all expenditures in the household. This information
is scaled to obtain an expression of annual consumption.
For the households entering the DES administrative register, data are collected on income, tax
payments and wealth at the end of the year corresponding to the survey year together with wealth
information for the previous year, and this is merged with the DES data. Total expenditure is then
imputed from the income and wealth information by simply calculating ct  yt  Wt , where yt is
disposable income and Wt is net wealth measured at the end of period t. While simple in theory, there
are many details involved in implementing this and we refer to Browning and Leth‐Petersen 2003
for details. For the analysis we use the same sample selection criteria as Browning and Leth‐Petersen
2003 . This leaves us with a sample of 3,352 observations.

4.2 Results
We start out by presenting in figure 1 the distributions of the two measures of total expenditure and
their individual level difference. The left panel shows that the distributions have modal points very
close to each other and the right panel shows that at the individual level the differences are centered at
zero. It is, however, also evident that there are important differences in the spread of the distributions
of the two measures, with the register based measure exhibiting larger dispersion. The way the data
are constructed implies that a fair amount of noise is expected. First, the interviews are distributed
across the calendar year, and this means that recall questions about durable purchases, for example,
do not necessarily pertain to the calendar year. Moreover, Browning and Leth‐Petersen 2003 show
that the measurement error in the imputed measure is related to capital gains on wealth components
used in the imputation.4

4 The Danish data hold information about the value of stocks and bonds at the household level, and this gives rise to
measurement error. Without direct information about both the quantities and the prices of assets it is not possible to
distinguish active savings decisions from capital gains. Koijen et al. 2011 use Swedish register data with exact information
about the holdings of stocks and bonds and are therefore able to address this issue.

attenuation bias. One thing to notice is that the blue line is almost linear and it is also noticeable that
the bias is apparent.

Table 1 presents the results from estimating the regression line by OLS. The estimate in column 1
shows that the bias is 0.21, suggesting that there is a fair amount of noise in the survey measure.
Restricting the size of the errors does not change the estimate much indicating that the bias is not
caused by outliers. Of course, concluding that the survey measure is noisy relies on assumptions 1 and
2 being correct, in particular that the measurement errors of the two measures are uncorrelated. Since
errors in the survey are related to the accurateness of the survey response and the register error is
related to capital gains on the portfolio, this assumption does not appear restrictive. The assumption
that the register error be uncorrelated with the true but unobserved level is not testable with our
data and will, for example, be violated if respondents with a low level of true consumption over‐report
and people with high true levels of consumption underreport.
Using Swedish data, Koijen et al 2011 run regressions similar to the ones presented in table 1 in
order to quantify the amount of noise in their data, and it appears that there is more noise in the
Swedish data than in our data. While there are differences between the two studies in terms of the
imputation method and the timing of the surveys, it is not clear why this pattern emerges.

4.3 Summary, example 1
In this example the possibility to construct a register based measure of total expenditure that can be
compared with the survey measure is illustrated. While the validity of this exercise hinges on two
important assumptions, we believe that the register approach provides an inexpensive way to get
some insights on the precision of the survey measure that is difficult to obtain otherwise.

4. Validating survey questions about gross income using third party reported
information from the income tax registers
An income variable is included in almost any survey collected by social scientists, and surveying is
often the only way to collect income jointly with other variables of interest. Danish register data on
income are of very high quality because they are automatically third party reported and are reported
separately for different types of income. In this section we compare the responses to a one‐shot recall
question about gross personal income collected by telephone interview in January 2010 to the tax
records of the respondents in order to assess the quality of the survey measure. As opposed to the
previous example the register information is now perceived to be close to the “truth”, and we
therefore expect to be relying much less on assumptions A.1 and A.2

5.1 data
In January 2010 the authors of this paper organized a telephone survey including 6004 completed
interviews. The purpose of the survey was to obtain information about their response to a stimulus
policy implemented in 2009.5 The sample is drawn randomly from the population of persons in
employment at some point in the period 1998‐2003, totaling 3.9 million persons or about 75% of the
Danish population. As part of the survey, respondents were asked a one‐shot recall question about
their gross annual income in 2009. The question was:
“We are also interested in knowing about the development in your income before taxes. We are
thinking about income such as earnings incl. employers pension contribution , pension payments,
payments from unemployment insurances, cash benefits or other forms of transfer income. What was
approximately your income before taxes in 2009?”
5

The results are available in Kreiner, Lassen and Leth‐Petersen 2012 , posted on our personal web sites.

10

5.394 persons answered the question. Self‐employed persons effectively self‐report income to the tax
authorities and we therefore do not have as much faith in the register information for this group as we
have for wage earners and persons receiving transfer income. We therefore select away persons with
own‐business income. Finally, we deselect two observations with negative gross income6 and are left
with 4,793 observations. The survey data were subsequently merged at the person level with
administrative register data about income from the income tax register covering the tax year 2009, i.e.
exactly the same period that the survey question was intended to cover.

5.2 Main results
Figure 3 presents the densities of the survey and the register measure left panel and the density of
the individual level differences between the two measures right panel . The left panel clearly reveals
that the means of the two measures are not equal. It also suggests that the spread of the survey
measure is larger as would be expected if the survey measure carries an error and the register
measure is accurate. The right panel confirms that the means are different when individual level
differences are considered and also that individual level errors have considerable spread, i.e. that the
survey measure is noisy.
Figure 4 graphs the register measure against the survey measure together with a smooth line through
the data and a diagonal. The picture shows some very large outliers and also that the regression line
has a smaller slope than the diagonal, indicating that the attenuation appears to be considerable.7

Negative gross income can occur because some components of capital income are available in our data set only as net
measures and therefore adds negatively to gross income if the net‐value is negative. This seems to be a small problem in the
data set. For most people the major capital expenditure components are constituted by interest payments on bank debt and
mortgages. Interest payments on bank and mortgage debt are observed, and when we take these components out 62 cases
are observed with negative capital income and half of these observations’ negative capital income is less than 1000USD. We
therefore conclude that this is a minor problem.
7 There is a graphically striking cluster of data points in the north eastern corner of the graph appearing to fall along a fairly
tight regression line that is different from the mass of the data points. The apparent importance of this cluster is a visual
deception because the cloud consists of only 64 observations. We have not been able to identify any significant differences
between these observations and the rest of the data set apart from finding that they are on average 4 years younger than the
rest of the sample. We also checked if interviewer effects could explain the pattern, but this was not the case.

This is confirmed by a parametric regression reported in table 2. Regressing the register measure on
the survey measure using the unrestricted sample yields an estimate of  of 0.57 indicating important
individual level deviations between the survey and the register measure. In column 2 the errors are
restricted to be within the ‐2;2 interval and this increases the estimate of  to 0.84 suggesting that a
limited number of outliers are responsible for a large part of the attenuation bias.

In table 3 the two measures of gross income and the individual level errors are regressed on a set of
“external” covariates. The idea is to see how the noise influences the covariance with other variables
often used in empirical analyses. Comparing the numbers in column 1 and 2 in table 4.2 suggests
that the register and the survey measure have similar covariance with the set of external variables, but
the parameter estimates obtained using the survey measure do differ significantly from the parameter
estimates obtained using the register measure for age, woman, number of children, single, and owner.
Regressing the individual level error on the same set of covariates suggests differences for the same
variables. If one take the register measure to be the “truth” then the results of column 3 suggests that
the measurement error associated with the survey measure is not classical.

5.3 Robustness
The survey question asks people to recall gross income including earnings, employers’ pension
contributions, transfer income, and capital income. Some of these are probably less salient to the
respondent; employers’ pension contribution is likely included in this category. This number does not
appear separately on the pay check nor on the tax return or the annual statement from the tax
authorities, since it is not liable to taxation before it is paid out. In a robustness check we subtract
employers’ pension contributions from the register measure and repeat the analysis of the previous
section to check if the survey measure performs better when compared to the adjusted register
measure. To do this we define an alternative gross income measure constructed from the registers
where employers’ pension contributions are deducted from the register measure used in the previous
section. The idea is to investigate if respondents are more likely to have stated their income without
employers’ pension contributions even though it is clearly stated in the survey question that it should
be included.
Figure 5 shows density graphs for the survey measure, the original register measure, and the register
measure where employers’ pension contributions are subtracted. The right panel shows densities of
differences between the register measures and the survey measure. The figure shows that subtracting
employers’ pension contributions reduces the mean bias, but also that the spread is almost unaffected.
Estimating  by OLS reveals that this has not improved on the precision at the individual level. In fact,
if anything the estimates of  in table 4 suggest that the attenuation bias has become more serious.

Further, examining the correlation with the external covariates reveals even stronger correlations
between the external covariates and the differences between the register and the survey measure.
These results are presented in table 5. In the regression of individual level differences between the
two measures on external covariates, column 3 , the parameters are now more significant, in
particular in the case of education dummies. This suggests that the ability of the respondents to

15

2

include employers’ pension contributions when reporting their income varies across educational
levels.
It is, of course, possible to construct many other concepts where other income components are
subtracted. The most salient feature of income is arguably earnings and transfer income which are
received at regular intervals and where the recipient receives a letter stating the amount paid out.
Capital income arrives in a less regular fashion and may therefore also be difficult to give an account
for. We have experimented with subtracting capital income from the register measure, but this made
little difference to the results and we therefore leave the results unreported. The calculations provided
in this paper are merely examples intended to illustrate the possibilities for identifying different
subcomponents of income and how this may be used to identify what components of income
respondents find it difficult to report in surveys.

5.4 Comparison to US findings
CEX and PSID use annual recall questions about income but ask about different income components
separately, e.g. earned income, transfer income and capital income. Bound et al. 1994 performed a
validation study of the earnings question in the PSID by comparing answers to the PSID questions
about earnings with company records for 418 workers from a single manufacturing company in 1983.
This sample is called the PSID Validation Study. They find that the mean difference between the survey
and the register measure is small but that the standard deviation of the difference is substantial
amounting to 0.67 of the standard deviation of the company records. The corresponding measure in
our data is 0.89. The slope coefficients from regressions of record on interview measure are similar
between the two studies, 0.76 in the Bound et al. study and 0.84 in the trimmed version in our study.8
Both studies suggest substantial measurement error. One limitation of the Bound et al. study is that it
is confined to validate the survey responses for a homogenous and small group. This could explain the
smaller error. Our results suggest that the survey error is correlated with standard covariates and that
the error is therefore not of the classical type. This leaves open the possibility that validation studies
based on narrowly defined samples such as the PSID Validation Study do not give a complete picture of
the size of the error in the main sample.
Another difference is that our study focuses on gross income including transfer income and capital
income. This leaves open the possibility that our income measure is more noisy only because we
include non‐earned income. Gottschalk and Moffitt 2011 show evidence about the development of
transitory family non labor income from the PSID, but to our knowledge the measures of transfer
income and capital income in the PSID have not been validated.
Overall the results from the present study and the study by Bound et al. have implications for studies
in many areas, but perhaps in particular for the interpretation of estimates from studies decomposing
income variances in to temporary and permanent components. The validation results suggest that
there is considerable noise in survey measures. This may explain why studies estimating income
processes on US data collected in different ways find different results. Specifically, in a series of papers
Gottschalk and Moffitt 1994 and Moffitt and Gottschalk 2002, 2011 use the PSID to decompose
income into permanent and transitory variations and find that the transitory component is relatively
big and increasing in the 1980s. For example, Moffitt and Gottschalk 2002 find that the variance of
transitory log earnings for males is around 0.15‐0.3. Kopczuk, Saez and Song 2010 use Social
Security Administration longitudinal earnings data for the period 1937‐2004 and find that the
Bound et al. 2001 survey nine studies validating survey based earnings measures from different US surveys
against administrative records. Four of these studies report regression coefficients from a regression of the
administrative record measure on the survey measure and three of these report regression coefficients in the
vicinity of 0.75 using different data sets.
8

transitory component is almost constant across time and relatively small, about 0.06‐0.08 for the
whole period and about 0.06 for the period 1980‐, and that it cannot explain the increase in the
variance of log earnings in the US during the 1980s. While there are many other differences between
these studies than the data collection mode, this does suggest the possibility that the size of the
measurement error is important and not constant across time.

5.5 Summary, example 2
The analysis of the quality of the recall question about annual gross income revealed that a one‐shot
recall question is inaccurate. Respondents tend to underreport their income level and the survey
measure is noisy. Changing the definition of the register measure by excluding employers pension
contributions corrected for some of the mean bias, but did not reduce the spread much, and in
particular did not reduce the attenuation bias in a regression of the register measure on the survey
measure. The analysis also suggested that the individual level differences between the survey and the
register measure were correlated with observed characteristics of the respondents suggesting that the
errors associated with the survey measure are not of the classical type.

6. Summary and suggestions for future work
This paper has provided two examples illustrating how Danish third‐party reported register data can
be matched at the individual or household level to survey records and used to validate the accuracy of
responses to survey questions. The first example suggests that expenditure survey evidence on total
expenditure is mean unbiased but noisy, and the second example suggests that a one‐shot recall
question about annual gross income is both mean biased and noisy.
The analyses presented in this paper are possible because all persons living in Denmark are assigned a
unique identification number to which all public authorities link up person specific information and
because surveys can be collected using the same person identifier. The potential of this validation
methodology is big. In the Danish context, it is possible to match survey and register data for
potentially the entire population, and it is also possible to match in the longitudinal dimension. In
this way Denmark can be thought of as a “laboratory” where much more detailed and focused
validation studies can be organized and where the impact of survey methodology on the accuracy of
the survey responses are investigated so as to optimize the survey methodology across different

18

groups and balancing this with survey costs.9 For example, in the context of validating income
questions the Danish setup allows researchers to merge survey records with tax records containing
detailed information about different types of income and this provides a unique opportunity to test the
ability of respondents to accurately report different types of income using different interviewing
techniques and questions. Using the register data it is also possible to consider individual as well as
household units and to assess the extent to which it is important to ask all household members or just
one in order to assess household income accurately. Finally, the Danish register data also contain very
detailed information about car purchases with information about the exact type of car and the time of
purchase. As in the Swedish case, see Koijen et al. 2011 , this can be mapped directly to survey
answers about purchases in order to test, for example, the impact of recall period length on precision
of answers for that particular good.
This study focused on cross sections of Danish households and persons. The Danish setup also allows
asking the same people repeatedly and to match with panel data on income and wealth. Very little is
known about the time series properties of measurement error in recall data. Bound et al. 1994 used
panel data on earnings for the PSID validation study, but this is limited in size and only concerns a very
narrowly defined group of people for two years. The Danish setup is much broader in scope since it
potentially covers the entire Danish population with longitudinal information from the administrative
registers. This provides a unique opportunity to learn about the time series properties of survey errors
in the future. For example, it should be critical to understand if the size of the survey error is constant
across time, if it always over‐/undershoots at the individual level, if the error is mean reverting but
persistent, etc. The survey used in example 2 in this study has been repeated to cover questions
concerning income in 2010 and will be repeated to cover 2011 through to 2013. When register data
have been released, we will be able to examine the time series properties of the survey errors.
The Danish setup allows matching new survey data with register data relatively easy and at relatively
low costs. Matched survey and register data are kept at Statistics Denmark’s servers and only
researchers working at authorized Danish research institutions can get access to working with the
matched data. However, researchers or statistical agencies with good research questions and
appropriate funding wishing to start new research projects using combined survey and register data
can do that in collaboration with Danish based researchers. This can for example be done by
contacting one of the authors of this paper.
9 For example, Olson et al. 2010 explore if giving people their preferred survey mode increases the response rate. This
possibility, however, potentially has a cost side to it by changing the level of precision for respondents who would have
participated irrespective of the mode. Safir and Goldenberg 2008 attempts to measure this using natural data, but this
approach ignores potentially important selection effects. In the Danish setting it would be possible to implement a
randomized design that would be able to quantify the impact of self selected mode choice on the precision of answers. As
another example, it would be possible to asses the loss in precision by applying proxy reporting
http://www.bls.gov/cex/methwrkshpproxyrpting.pdf by which survey responses are provided by a respondent about
another member of the sampled unit or household.
