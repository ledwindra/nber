Poor Quality Drugs and Global Trade: A Pilot Study

ABSTRACT
Experts claim that some Indian drug manufacturers cut corners and make substandard drugs for markets
with non-existent, under-developed or emerging regulatory oversight, notably Africa. This paper assesses
the quality of 1470 antibiotic and tuberculosis drug samples that claim to be made in India and were
sold in Africa, India, and five mid-income non-African countries. We find that 10.9% of those products
fail a basic assessment of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), and the majority of the failures
are substandard (7%) as they contain some correct API but the amount of API is under-dosed. The
distribution of these substandard products is not random: they are more likely to be found as unregistered
products in Africa than in India or non-African countries. Since this finding is robust for manufacturer-drug
fixed effects, one likely explanation is that Indian pharmaceutical firms and/or their export intermediaries
do indeed differentiate drug quality according to the destination of consumption.

Introduction

Free trade allows specialization, encourages competition and generally enhances efficiency.
However, when it comes to heavily regulated products such as prescription drugs, globalization implies a
patchwork of uneven regulations and, as a result, the outcomes of free trade are less certain. Countries
differ greatly in their product registration process, quality standards, price controls, customs and law
enforcement. For a drug to be produced in country A and exported to country B, legitimate manufacturers
have to meet multiple regulatory targets in both countries, which increases the cost of compliance and
commerce while introducing incentives for cheating and even trading falsified or substandard medicines.
In this paper, we examine 1470 samples of antibiotics and tuberculosis (TB) medicines claiming
to be made in India. They were collected from five cities inside India as well as 17 low-to-middle-income
countries outside of India, and tested for quality using the Minilab protocol. We find that a significantly
higher fraction of these Indian-made drugs are of poorer quality if they were purchased from Africa than
from India or from Non-African mid-income countries such as China, Brazil, Turkey, Thailand and
Russia. These patterns persist even after we control for manufacturer fixed effects, suggesting that they
are driven by variations within the same manufacturer as labeled on the package. Moreover, the above
pattern is driven more by non-registered substandard products that contain insufficient active
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) than by falsified drugs that contain zero API.
Pharmaceutical experts anecdotally have observed that some Indian manufacturers sell inferior
medicines to markets where drug regulatory oversight is weak, and better medicines to markets where
oversight is more effective.1 This paper attempts to test whether this perception is validated by the data.
In doing so, there are some challenging factual confounders: isolated reports2, now several years old,
indicate Chinese organized criminals counterfeited Indian drugs; and even genuine, top quality Indian
drugs can degrade with improper handling so as to become substandard. Neither of these circumstances is
the fault of Indian companies. However, our findings suggest that the main problem for inferior quality in
Africa of Indian products is more likely in the manufacturing than in counterfeiting or careless storage.

1 On May 13, 2013, Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, a major Indian drug manufacturer, pleaded guilty with seven
US federal criminal charges on selling adulterated generic drugs, fabricating data, and committing fraud. The
company was reported to have a culture that was ―for management to dictate the results it wanted and for those
beneath to bend the process to achieve it.‖ Dinesh Thakur, the whistle blower, described ―how Ranbaxy took its
greatest liberties in markets where regulation was weakest and the risk of discovery was lowest.‖ (Fortune, May 15,

Some Indian manufacturers as labeled in our drug samples do appear to differentially supply poor quality
products to African markets where GDP per capita is low and local regulations are weak.
We review the related literature in Section 2 and then describe how we arrive at the above data
patterns in Section 3. Section 4 explores a few potential explanations. While it is often difficult to pin
down the intent of organized crime, we crosscheck our samples with their product registration status at
the destination country, as failure to register a medicine is unlawful in most countries and prima facie
evidence of wrongdoing. We argue that the significant cost of product registration affects the incentive of
quality choice by manufacturers. Section 5 discusses the implication of our findings for various parties.

II. Literature
Our work is related to two strands of literature, one on drug quality in global markets and the
other on international trade of medicines.
The literature on global drug quality aims to document the extent of quality problems. As
summarized in IOM (2013), industrial databases, international police investigations, case studies, news
reports, and scientific works based on retail drug samples have all pointed to a non-trivial problem of
falsified and substandard drugs. However, existing evidence often suffers from reporting bias, a small
number of observations, and lack of representative coverage. As a result, public data are limited in
estimating the magnitude of the problem. That being said, data from the Pharmaceutical Security Institute
indicate that poor-quality medicines were found in 124 countries in 2011, with the problem more severe
in low- and mid-income countries than in developed countries (IOM 2013). One potential explanation is
that developing countries have weak regulatory oversight and lax law enforcement, which attract the
manufacture and trade of poor-quality drugs.
The international trade literature stresses patent protection. Using the implementation deadline of
the World Trade Organizations Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), researchers have
shown that patent protection led to faster market launch, higher sales, and increased prices for innovatorbranded drugs (Kyle and Qian 2013; Duggan and Goyal 2012).3 Better patent protection is also found to
encourage drug innovation and patent applications (Arora et al. 2008, Kyle & McGahan 2012).
Chaudhuri, Goldberg and Jia (2006) examined the impact of patent protection on generic entry and
consumer welfare. For one type of antibiotic in India, they first estimated demand elasticity and marginal
production cost and then simulated the effect of reducing domestic generic entry in response to more

3

Similar to patent protection, other pharmaceutical regulations may affect the diffusion of new drugs as well. For
example, Cockburn, Lanjouw and Schankerman (2014) show that stringent price control tends to delay new drug
launches in both low- and mid-income countries.

3

stringent patent protection. They found that greater patent protection would reduce the total welfare of
domestic consumers.
Patent-protected drugs are less prominent in low- to mid-income countries, where they may be
only affordable by a small share of the population. Most people have to rely on cheaper, generic drugs for
most diseases. As shown in Bate, Mathur and Jin (2010), the likelihood of poor-quality drugs is much
greater in cheap, generic drugs than in expensive, innovator branded drugs. Moreover, according to a
report by McKinsey (2013), the international market penetration of generic drugs is greater than that of
innovator brands. From the public health perspective, international trade is arguably more important on
the low end than on the high end of drug quality, but little academic work has looked at the trade of poorquality drugs in global markets.
Our pilot study aims to address this gap in the literature. In particular, we focus on generic
antibiotics and tuberculosis (TB) medicines that are labeled ―made in India.‖ In the past two decades,
India has grown to be the third largest manufacturing country for pharmaceuticals, accounting for 13% of
the global pharmaceutical production (in value) and 22% of international trade in generic medicines
(Sharma, Kumar and Sharma 2008; KPMG 2006). Thousands of pharmaceutical companies operate in
India, some are large and licensed while others are small and informal (KPMG 2006). According to an
Indian government report on the industry (MCFDP 2012), nineteen of the twenty-one large Indian
pharmaceutical manufacturers devoted at least 50% of their net sales to export in 2010-11, of which nine
exported more than 75%.4 One primary advantage of Indian drugs is their cheap price (Cameron et al.
2008). Health Action International’s interactive map shows that Indian generic ciprofloxacin is the
cheapest in the world, often by two orders of magnitude from richer market innovator versions.5
We choose to focus on common broad-spectrum antibiotics and specialized tuberculosis
antibiotics in solid oral form (tablets and capsules) because these anti-bacterial medicines are among the
most commonly used in developing countries. Inferior versions can be both fatal to the patient, and
promote drug resistance that undermines the future effectiveness of even good quality medicines. Antiinfectives are also one of the drug categories most affected by poor drug quality (IOM 2013).
Making poor-quality anti-bacterials can be a lucrative business because the quality problem is
hard to detect by end users. Most patients recover from bacterial infections even without treatment, so
effective treatment simply accelerates the natural process. Even in the worst, fatal cases, it is seldom
possible to prove that inferior drug treatment is the cause of death. This is especially true of tuberculosis,
where treatment typically lasts 6 to 24 months, and the effect of good or bad quality medicines is not
immediately obvious. Only in settings where physicians may be treating hundreds of patients with inferior

medicines are problems with the medicines likely to be spotted. For example, in 1995 Niger discovered
the tens of thousands of meningitis vaccine doses it received from Nigeria were fake, because over 2,500
people died as a result.6 7 Such tragic clusters are often the only reasons investigations are undertaken in
emerging markets. In short, faking antibiotics and TB medicines, and cutting corners in making
substandard quality, can be a profitable exercise and one unlikely to be punished.
Not only will inferior medicines harm individual patients, but intermittently effective medicines
containing some but not sufficient anti-bacterial ingredients evolve drug resistance (Bate et al 2013,
Binagwaho et al 2013). Experience teaches that drug resistance does not stay confined, but spreads to
other countries. Thus poor quality medicines consumed in poor countries can evolve resistance that
diminishes from treatment outcomes even in rich countries where good quality medicines predominate.
Anecdotes suggest that international trade may have facilitated the spread of poor-quality
medicines. For instance, in 2013 US Government and Ghana’s Food and Drug Authority (GFDA)
published a report showing that 95% of the imported medicines to treat postpartum hemorrhage (from
India and China) failed quality control, since then GFDA has banned some of those companies from
exporting (USP 2013; Bate 2013). Even relatively impoverished and corrupt nations like Nigeria have
detected quality problems in international trade and prevented 22 Indian companies from exporting to
Nigeria in 2008.8 Quality concerns have also motivated major NGOs like World Vision, which is one of
the largest private donors of medicines, including antibiotics, to emerging markets, to assess the quality of
the products they procure. Even the US, which relies on Indian manufacturers for 40% of its over-thecounter medications, is concerned about imported drug quality after the Ranbaxy scandal. 9 While
screening efforts from a single import country or a single NGO may address the problem for a particular
destination of import, we seek to uncover systematic patterns regarding the international trade of poorquality drugs.

III. Data Description
Over 2,500 treatments of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, isoniazid and rifampicin, were collected
from pharmacies in 22 cities of 18 low- to mid-income countries between 2009 and 2012. The sampling
methodology is detailed elsewhere (Bate et al 2014). Briefly, in each target city, we instructed covert
shoppers from the local population to randomly walk into pharmacies and claim that a family member

needed a specific type of drug. To mimic real patients as much as possible, the covert shoppers did not
present a doctor’s prescription and always purchased the pharmacist-suggested brand. Informal drug
vendors (bus vendors, mobile carts, etc.) are prevalent in some locations, but to be able to compare across
all locations, our shoppers only visited pharmacies with a regular storefront. As a result, our samples are
likely to understate the problem of poor-quality drugs, given the expectation and existing evidence that
informal vendors sell worse drugs (IOM 2013).
All medicines were assessed following the Global Pharma Health Fund (GPHF) e.V. Minilab®
protocol to identify substandard or counterfeit medicines. The key test for our sample is the semiquantitative thin-layer chromatography (TLC), which assesses the presence and concentration of active
ingredient in a test sample as compared to the reference standard.10 Given the size of our sample and our
funding constraint, TLC is the best test method we can afford.11 Following the classification in Bate, Jin
and Mathur (2014), a drug sample is referred to as falsified if it contains zero correct API12, and referred
to as substandard if it contains some correct API but the amount of API is under-dosed (below 80%).
As acknowledged in other studies (Attaran et al 2012), the legal distinction between falsified and
substandard products is one of intention: both sorts of compromised medicines are not as labeled and
violate the relevant technical standards, but substandard medicines are compromised accidentally or
negligently, while falsified medicines are compromised intentionally, with this difference not always
being apparent from the content of the medicine. In other words, legally speaking, falsified products are
the product of organized criminal intent, but substandard medicines are wrongfully produced by otherwise
legitimate, law-abiding manufacturers.13 However, this legal distinction breaks down when a legitimate
manufacturer intentionally cheats on the ingredients of the medicine. In light of the difficulty to detect the
intent of manufacture, this paper distinguishes substandard and falsified drugs by API only.
The API results on ciprofloxacin, isoniazid and rifampicin have been reported in several peer
review papers (Bate, Jin, Mathur 2011; Bate et al. 2013; Bate, Jin, Mathur 2014) but none of them

10

The TLC test requires the tested product to have 80-100% of the correct active ingredient, when compared to the
reference standard. The principal spot obtained with the test solution should travel the same distance on a TLC plate
and yield highly similar shapes, colors, intensities, and sizes as the reference standard. The distance that the sample
travels informs of the drug identity; the intensity of the spot informs of the amount of active ingredient (Jähnke et al.
2001).
11
TLC test has strengths and drawbacks as compared to more advanced techniques such as high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and spectroscopy (IOM 2013). Its main strength is the ability to yield ―versatile and
robust‖ results at a low cost (Kaale et al., 2011).
12
Only a few samples have obvious falsified packaging and they all turn out to have zero API.
13
There are no publications in the literature demonstrating non-zero API for fake antibiotics or TB drugs, and
personal communications with two investigators at pharmaceutical companies and one drug regulator indicated that
while non-zero API has been found for some falsified products (notably antimalarials), it has not so far been found
for antibiotics or TB drugs. See Bate (2012) for more details.

compares drug quality of the same manufacturer across different purchase countries. The data on
erythromycin are used for the first time in this paper.
Our sample contained medicines from 29 countries of manufacture as stated on the packaging,
among which India is the largest. We focus here only on the 1470 products that claim to be ―made in
India‖. The label of these products reveals 17 unique Indian manufacturers.14 Note that being labeled
―made in India‖ does not necessarily mean the actual manufacturer is an Indian firm. In a few instances,
we obtained information that samples were faked by organized criminals from China. This is borne in
mind in analyzing the data and exploring potential explanations.
Table 1 shows the distribution of drugs by drug type and purchase country. Among the four drug
types, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin are mainstream broad-spectrum antibiotics, isoniazid and
rifampicin are first-line antibiotics for tuberculosis (TB) mycobacteria. Because drug availability varies
across purchase countries (in part because the targeted disease varies), we have 691 ciprofloxacin from all
18 purchase countries, 286 erythromycin from 11 countries, 223 isoniazid from 10 countries and 270
rifampicin from 11 countries. Out of the total 1470 ―made-in-India‖ samples, 956 were bought within
India, 430 bought from Africa, and 84 bought from Non-African countries outside of India (including
China, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Thailand). In the rest of the paper, we refer to the three exclusive groups of
purchase countries as Indian domestic, Africa, and Non-Africa.
Table 1 summarizes drug quality and price by drug type and purchase country group. Prices are
converted to US dollars by the exchange rate at the time of purchase and deflated to 2010 dollars. As
detailed above, quality is measured by conformity to active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content in a
chromatographic assay. We define a sample as failing the basic quality test if its API is below 80% of the
correct amount of API (as in the benchmark authentic sample), with 0% API as falsified. Out of the 1470
samples, 10.9% failed basic quality tests, 103 (7%) were substandard and 57 (3.9%) were falsified.
Both antibiotics and TB drugs had more substandard than falsified products, which is consistent
with negligence being more widespread than outright crime. As shown in Table 1, India domestic drugs
are substantially cheaper than drugs purchased out of India, consistent with the literature (Cameron et al.
2008). However, drugs purchased from Africa are more likely to fail the TLC test than the same type of
drugs in the Indian domestic group. In comparison, drugs from Non-Africa have a greater passing rate
than the Indian domestic ones within the same drug type.
Many studies have shown that product registration is arguably the most important drug regulation
in developing countries, although its practice varies greatly from one country to another (Bate et al 2010,

14

Our IRB commitment prevents us from revealing the identity of individual manufacturers as labeled on the
package.

7

Torstensson and Pugatch 2010). Our previous studies also show that registered and unregistered products
differ significantly in both price and quality (Bate, Mathur and Jin 2011, 2014). In light of this, Table 2
groups the data by purchase country group and product registration status. Consistent with previous
findings, registered products charge a higher price and are more likely to pass the TLC test.
Conditional on failing the TLC test, we find that registered products are more likely to be falsified
than to be substandard, which is consistent with legitimate manufacturers at least making a diligent effort
to abide by the law through the regulatory process. The correlation between product registration status
and purchase country group is interesting. Among registered products, we observe more falsified drugs
than substandard drugs out of India, for both Africa and Non-Africa. Inside India, the percent of
substandard drugs is slightly higher (3.3%) than falsified drugs (2.5%). Overall, the passing rates of
registered products are similar across the three purchase groups, ranging from 91.9% to 94.4%. However,
among non-registered products, the composition of passing, falsified and substandard drugs is vastly
different across country groups. The passing rate in Africa is even below 50%, and the majority of
failures are driven by substandard drugs. The passing rate inside India is also low (67.8%), with
substantially more substandard drugs (22.6%) than falsified drugs (9.6%). Non-African countries are the
best (100% pass), but the number of observations is very small. To summarize, these patterns suggest that
the quality difference by purchase country group is mostly driven by non-registered products and
substandard drugs account for the majority of problems in non-registered products.
Could these patterns be driven by Indian manufacturers exporting products of different quality to
different countries? Table 3 regresses the dummy of passing the quality test on drug purchase country
groups, with and without manufacturer-drug fixed effects (drug type fixed effects are included in the
regression without manufacturer-drug fixed effects). We use linear probability model instead of probit in
order to facilitate comparison with and without a large number of manufacturer-drug fixed effects.15 The
error terms are clustered by drug and purchase country group. Using the full sample, the first column
finds significantly lower quality in Africa than in India domestic, while Non-Africa is statistically better
than India domestic. This negative coefficient on Africa is even more conspicuous after we control for
manufacturer-drug fixed effects in Column 2. With the fixed effects, Non-Africa and India domestic
become statistically similar to each other. In the third and fourth columns, we redo the regressions for
registered drugs only and find no significant difference across the three country groups. When we focus
on non-registered drugs only, quality in Africa is significantly worse than Indian domestic, and quality in
15

Some of the 30 manufacturer-drug combinations have less than 10 observations in the cell, and these small cells
may generate incidental parameter problem in probit with fixed effects. That being said, results are robust if we use
probit instead of linear probability model (with the manufacturer-drug fixed effects). The probit results are available
upon request.

8

Non-Africa is the best. Again this pattern becomes even stronger in magnitude when we control for
manufacturer fixed effects, suggesting that they are driven by variations within the manufacturer-drug
combination.

IV. Further Data Analysis and Potential Interpretations
So far, we have discovered two interesting patterns regarding drug quality: first, ―Indian made‖
drugs purchased from Africa are of the worst quality, followed by the domestic purchases within India,
and those purchased from Non-Africa countries outside of India. This pattern is robust to manufacturer
fixed effects. Second, the above pattern is mostly driven by non-registered substandard products. This
section attempts to use data analysis and economic logic to explain these data patterns.

IV.1 Why do we observe the worst drug quality in Africa?
To highlight the differences between Africa, India domestic and Non-Africa, we collect
country/city specific data in six dimensions: GDP per capita, adult literacy, the presence of any price
control, maximum penalty for counterfeiting, Rule of Law (ROL) index, and International Property Right
Index (IPRI).
In particular, the year- and city-specific GDP per capita data (adjusted for PPP) were constructed
for 2009, 2010 and 2012 using city GDP estimates from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC 2009) and city
population estimates from the 2009 revision of the UN’s World Urbanization Prospects Report (UK 2009;
UN 2009). The PWC city GDP estimates for 2008 were extended to 2009-2012 using country level GDP
growth rates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF 2009-2012). City population estimates were
extended forward to 2012 using the UN report’s 2005–2010 average population growth and its 2015
estimated population growth figures (UN revisions for 2005-2010). For Accra, Kampala, Kigali,
Lubumbashi, Lusaka and Maputo, city-level data were not available in some years, so we used countrylevel GDP per capita data from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database as of July 2014 (IMF 2014).
Male and female adult literacy rates were obtained from country-specific UNESCO data from
2009 and 2012, compiled from censuses and surveys conducted between 1999 and 2012. For four
countries (Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa) UNESCO did not have 2009 figures. In these cases,
we relied on the 2009 UNDP Human Development Report (UNDP 2009), which compiles countryspecific data from censuses and surveys conducted between 1999 and 2007, which are also compiled by
UNESCO (UN 2009). The literacy rates of these four countries are therefore slightly older than the rest.
We take the average of female and male literacy rates as they are highly correlated (correlation coefficient
= 0.89).

9

Price regulations include whether a purchase country issues price ceilings, mandatory retail
prices, and/or price guidance. We hand-collected these regulations from each country’s most recent
government documents. Given the wide variety of price regulations across countries, a binary variable
was defined as equal to one if a country has adopted any price regulation on pharmaceuticals in the data
collection year and zero otherwise. For two observations, we use the closest later-year data to impute
missing values in 2009.
We proxy ex post penalty for counterfeiters by the number of months a person will be sentenced
to prison if he is found guilty for counterfeiting drugs. Minimum and maximum penalty were hand
collected from the latest legal documents we could find in each country. To accommodate diverse
sentencing guidelines, monetary fines are coded as zero months and the death penalty is coded as 360
months (30 years). We use maximum penalty in the analysis. For six countries, we could not find any
information on maximum penalty, which accounts for 8.3% of the analysis sample.
Rule of Law index was constructed by the World Justice Project. Based on 100,000 household
and expert surveys in 99 countries and jurisdictions, this index describes a nation’s rule of law status by
summarizing 47 indicators along nine themes: constraints on government powers; absence of corruption;
open government; fundamental rights; order and security; regulatory enforcement; civil justice; criminal
justice; and informal justice (WJP 2014). ROL index was first available in 2010, and has increased its
country coverage from 66 countries in 2010 to 99 countries in 2014. If a country was covered by the ROL
index since 2010, we use its 2010 ROL index for the data collection years before 2010 and its 2012 ROL
index for the sample year of 2012. If a country was first covered by the ROL index in 2012 or 2014, we
use the closest later-year ROL index to impute its missing value in earlier years. Of the 1470
observations, 10.9% have imputed ROL index, another 3.1% have missing values in the ROL index as
ROL never covered 3 countries in our sample.
The IPRI index was constructed by the Property Rights Alliance (PRA), with the help of 74
international organizations and the Hernando de Soto Fellowship Program (PRA 2013). It measures the
intellectual and physical property rights of 131 nations. The IPRI index was first available in 2007 and
updated yearly since then. We use the IPRI index corresponding to the data collection year. If a country
has missing values in a specific year, we use its closest later-year IPRI index to impute the missing value
(2.1% of observations have imputed IPRI index).
Both ROL and IPRI indices provide a large number of indicators by detailed categories. Because
these indicators are highly correlated, we use the overall ROL and IPRI indices. Countries that have
missing values in the ROL index or maximum legal penalty carry a dummy variable indicating the
missing data for the specific variable.
Table 4 summarizes the country/city specific characteristics in our sample. Table 5 shows their

10

correlations. As expected, GDP per capita is positively correlated with adult literacy, rule of law, and
IPRI index. Richer countries are more likely to have any price regulation, but the correlation between
GDP per capita and maximum penalty for counterfeiting is much weaker.
In Table 6, we first repeat the basic regression from Table 3 Column 2 (dependent variable is
whether a drug sample passes the TLC test), and then add country/city characteristics one by one to detect
their influence on drug quality. Manufacturer-drug fixed effects are always included. GDP per capita,
adult literacy rate and having any price regulation has a significant coefficient in the regression when they
are the only country attribute on the right hand side. The coefficients for the ROL and IPRI indices are
insignificant, probably because they are subject to more measurement errors. The last column of Table 6
includes all country/city characteristics. Only the coefficients of GDP per capita and having price
regulation remain significant at the 95% level, but the coefficient of Africa is much closer to zero in
magnitude and no longer significant.
Overall, these results suggest that GDP per capita has the biggest statistical power explaining the
quality differences across purchase country groups, but GDP per capita plus the other country/city
characteristics explain more than GDP per capita alone.

IV.2 Which part of the supply chain is likely responsible for poor drug quality in Africa?

While income, education and local regulations may all contribute to worse drug quality in Africa,
the fight against poor drug quality requires more knowledge about the source of poor drug quality. Is it
because Indian manufacturers cut corners before exporting, or do some criminal counterfeiters pretend to
be legitimate manufacturers? Maybe distributors also do a poor storage job along the supply chain which
affects drug quality? Answering these questions will help improve drug quality, but direct evidence is
extremely hard to get.
Even if the manufacturer label is correct, the manufacturer may prefer to claim a poor quality
sample counterfeit and therefore circumvent its responsibility. It is even harder to pin down the intent of
cheating in legal terms, without hard evidence pointing to the status of the manufacturer’s mind at the
time of manufacture. Given these difficulties, below we try to use economic logic to infer the most likely
party responsible for poor-quality drugs. Readers should be aware that our inference is based on data,
anecdotes, and assumptions, and therefore is at most an intelligent guess.
There are several possibilities regarding the true responsible party behind poor-quality drugs. In
the first possibility, all manufacturer labels are correct but some Indian manufacturers intentionally export
inferior products to Africa. This could happen because African countries are typically poorer, have a less
educated population, and do not function well in regulating drug quality (Seiter 2010). The second

11

possibility is that counterfeiters who pretend to be the labeled Indian manufacturer produce poorer-quality
drugs in Africa because the risk of being caught is lower in African countries. Thirdly, wholesale
distributors obtain the same good-quality drugs from India but they do a worse job in storing and
distributing drugs in Africa. This could happen either because the cost of proper storage is too high in
Africa or because distributors cut corners intentionally.
While poor distribution undoubtedly occurs in some settings (Bate 2012), it is unlikely to reduce
API from 100% to 0%. Hence, poor distribution cannot explain falsified products. Moreover, our
previous paper analyzed a larger dataset of ciprofloxacin samples including both SRA-approved and other
types (Bate, Jin and Mathur 2014), where SRA approval refers to production approved by at least one
western country with a stringent quality standard (e.g. US). In that paper, we found that SRA-approved
ciprofloxacin, if containing any correct API, always passed the basic quality test regardless whether they
were purchased from Africa or elsewhere.16 This suggests that degradation should not be the main factor
driving poor drug quality in Africa. This finding is consistent with a study undertaken in Ghana, which
found poor performance of ―Indian-made‖ products, but no product quality problems for European
manufactured medicines sampled (USP 2013). For this reason, we ignore the role of distributors and
focus on the potential identity of manufacturer.
To obtain an intelligent guess of whether the true manufacturer is the labeled Indian firm or a
counterfeiter, we need a few more assumptions. In particular, we assume individual consumers cannot
discern drug quality at the time of purchase, although there is some chance that sophisticated consumers
or third-parties (e.g. government, NGOs, researchers) may discover poor quality drugs in the future.17
This implies that today’s market demand (q) only depends on observable manufacturer characteristics but
it is more valuable to continue the business beyond today if the quality of today’s product is good. For
simplicity, let us assume drug quality can be good (G, with >80% API), substandard (S, with > 0% and <
80% API), or bad (B, with 0% API), and denote the value of continuing the business after today as V.
Now consider three types of ―Indian‖ manufacturers that produce drug X in purchase country A:
the first type is a real Indian firm that has registered with the government of A (referred to as ―registered
firm‖); the second type is a real Indian firm that has not registered in A (referred to as ―unregistered
firm‖); and the third type is a counterfeiter who may choose to pretend to be the registered firm or the
unregistered firm. Consumers observe the labeled manufacturer identity and its registration status. All
three types of manufacturers may choose to produce good (G), substandard (S), or bad (B).

16

As reported in Bate, Jin and Mathur (2014), there are 89 SRA approved ciprofloxacin in our data: 88 of them
passed the basic quality test and one was found to be falsified.
17
It should be noted that arguably the most sophisticated NGO in the health sphere, Doctors Without Borders, was
itself a victim of buying falsified HIV medications. So while NGOs may discover a problem, it is invariably after the
fact.

Because product registration is costly, registered products often enjoy better price on the market and
selling unregistered products is technically illegal, we believe the long run loss of producing poor quality
is greater for registered firms. In other words, under the assumption that

and

, registered firms should have more incentives to produce good quality products
than unregistered firms.
The incentives of the counterfeiter are somewhat different. Because most counterfeiters are flyby-night, we assume they only care about profit in the near future net of the potential risk of being caught
for counterfeiting. Since the penalty for counterfeiting is usually independent of whether the counterfeits
contain any API, this implies that producing zero-API drugs always generates higher profits than
producing drugs with correct API, regardless whom the counterfeiter pretends.
If counterfeiters will only produce bad quality drugs, the question is whether they should
counterfeit registered products or unregistered products. Recall that registered products imply higher
prices and a larger demand. Let
being caught is

be the penalty of counterfeiting if caught. Assuming the chance of

for counterfeiting an unregistered

product, the counterfeiter would prefer to pretend to be a registered firm if

∙

∙

∙

∙ . In other words, the main tradeoff for the counterfeiter is

the higher profit of counterfeiting registered products versus the potentially higher risk of being caught if
he counterfeits registered products. If the chance of being caught is the same for counterfeiting registered
and unregistered products, the counterfeiter will prefer to counterfeit registered products.
Above all, we argue that the counterfeiter most likely counterfeits registered products and
produces the worst quality drug, as long as the drug quality is not observable to consumers, the penalty

13

for counterfeiting is independent of drug quality, and the chance of being caught counterfeiting is about
the same regardless of who the counterfeiter pretends to be. These arguments imply that the substandard
drugs in our data are unlikely driven by counterfeiters. If they are not driven by counterfeiters, they
should be more likely driven by unregistered Indian firms than by registered Indian firms, because we
know from the above paragraph that registered firms have already paid the cost of product registration
and therefore should have more incentives to produce good quality drugs than non-registered firms.
Following this logic, we expand our data analysis by product registration status and detailed
quality categories. In the first two columns of Table 7, we first repeat the basic quality regression (as in
Column 2 Table 3, dependent variable = passing the basic quality test) and then add in the dummy of
product registration as well as its interaction with the Africa and Non-Africa dummies. Manufacturerdrug fixed effects are always included. As we expect, registered products are more likely to pass the TLC
test. The coefficient of Africa*product registration is of similar absolute magnitude but opposite sign to
the coefficient of the Africa dummy. This suggests that drug samples purchased in Africa are similar in
basic quality from India domestic, if the samples are registered in the purchase country. Similar results
apply to Non-Africa countries. In contrast, unregistered products still show significant quality difference
between Africa (worst), India domestic, and Non-Africa countries (best).
In the next four columns of Table 7, we repeat these regressions but redefine the dependent
variable as whether the drug sample is falsified, or whether the drug sample is substandard. The last two
columns of Table 7 switch the dependent variable back to whether a drug sample passes the basic quality
test, but restrict the sample to non-falsified samples only. Consistent with Table 2, these columns suggest
that the biggest quality difference across purchase country groups concentrate in non-registered
substandard products. According to the logic above, we believe the most likely explanation is that the
labeled Indian manufacturers have produced the substandard products and they are not registered in the
African destination.

V. Discussion
Overall, our sample of ―Indian-made‖ medicines reveals two data patterns: first, drug quality is
inferior among drugs purchased inside African countries compared to those purchased inside India or
middle-income countries. Second, the biggest driver of this quality difference is the substandard drugs
that contain insufficient API and are non-registered in the African destination. These findings are based
on crude API assessment of a limited number of drug samples, thus their generalizability is subject to
future research. Our sample frame is also limited in geography and the type of retail outlets, both of which
restrict our ability to link the presence of substandard and falsified drugs to more detailed country-specific
attributes.

14

That being said, these findings support what has been known anecdotally for years, that some
Indian drug companies segment the global medicine market into portions that are served by different
quality medicines. While the notion of ―export grade‖ marketing is familiar in other sectors such as
agriculture, it appears to exist for medicines also, with Indian manufacturers exporting lower quality
goods to Africa. They can do this because, presumably, African regulatory oversight is weaker (resulting
in fewer registered products) as compared to middle-income countries, and because of reluctance to sell
the worst medicines in India itself. Even allowing for differences in GDP this finding is robust.
There are alternative explanations, though none as likely. It is known that some organized
criminals from China have counterfeited Indian products, although after this practice came to light several
years ago there have not been subsequent reports that we know of. Poor storage of initially good Indian
products can also lead to degradation, although the environmental conditions favoring degradation (heat,
light, humidity) are not especially worse in Africa than other tropical settings such as India, where a lower
rate of product failure was observed. Neither of these circumstances is the fault of Indian companies, but
neither seems sufficient or likely to explain the data observations either, under our assumptions on the
substantial cost of product registration and the risk of being caught in producing substandard or falsified
drugs.
Africans are aware of their vulnerability to substandard and falsified medicines. At the time of
this writing, West Africa and East Africa are trying to harmonize and improve their drug regulation
practices. 18 Individual countries such as Nigeria and Ghana have banned sales from some Indian
companies, and have pressured the Indian drug regulator. On one occasion, India’s minister of state for
commerce and industry even visited Nigeria and divulged the names of Indian companies producing fake
medicines to boycott (Raufu 2003; Akunyili 2005). Since apparently India’s drug regulator feels that
approach is necessary, regional, rather than simply national, regulatory action and boycotts of specific
Indian manufacturers might drive better performance from all Indian exporters.
There is also scope for collective security approaches. For example, in the civil aviation industry,
regulators aim enforcement actions not against any single foreign airline that breaches safety standards,
but all airlines of any foreign country that fails to uphold certain minimum standards. Under this
collective regulatory response, recently all Indian airlines were downgraded and lost the right to expand
their flight operations in the United States—a development that gives India’s aviation regulator powerful
incentive to raise safety standards across the board. 19 Applying this approach to medicines, if drug
regulators from Africa, America and Europe jointly decide to impose tougher quality inspection practices

on Indian-sourced products as a whole, it may help to eliminate the incentive for Indian manufacturers to
target their failing medicines preferentially toward Africa.
A softer response to these findings would be simply to increase informational flows to African
doctors and pharmacists about the possible inferior quality of some Indian drugs; even naming Indian
companies repeatedly found to sell substandard medicines. While many African doctors anecdotally are
already wary of Indian medicines, such an effort might further drive the African middle classes away
from many Indian products.
Lastly, although this paper has focused on Indian produced medicines, India is by no means the
only large exporter of drugs. Further research into the drug quality of Chinese and other export countries
would be useful to understand how widespread the problem may be.

Notes: Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Default group is India domestic. All regressions use linear
probability model. All regressions control for missing-value dummies for Rule of Law index and maximum legal penalty, as well as
imputed-value dummies for the Rule of Law index, IPRI index, maximum legal penalty, and price regulation. Errors are clustered by drugcountrygroup where countrygroup is defined Africa, Non-africa and India domestic.
