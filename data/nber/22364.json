    "abstract": "\n\nDynamic economic  models make predictions about impulse responses that characterize how macroeconomic processes respond to alternative shocks over different horizons.   From the perspective of asset pricing,  impulse responses  quantify the exposure of  macroeconomic processes and other cash flows to macroeconomic  shocks.  Financial markets provide compensations to  investors who are exposed to these shocks.  Adopting an asset pricing vantage point, we describe and apply methods for computing exposures to macroeconomic shocks and the implied compensations represented as elasticities over alternative payoff horizons. The outcome is a term structure of macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\n",
