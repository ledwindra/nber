Resolving Intertemporal Conflicts: Economics vs Politics
Antony Millner and Geoffrey Heal
NBER Working Paper No. 20705
November 2014
JEL No. D9,H43,Q2
ABSTRACT
Intertemporal conflicts occur when a group of agents with heterogeneous time preferences must make
a collective decision about how to manage a common asset. How should this be done? We examine
two methods: an 'Economics' approach that seeks to implement efficient allocations, and a 'Politics'
approach in which agents vote over consumption plans. We compare these methods by varying two
characteristics of the problem: are agents' preferences known or are they hidden information, and can
they commit to intertemporal collective plans or not? We show that if commitment is possible the
Economics approach always Pareto dominates the Politics approach, in both full and hidden information
scenarios. By contrast, without commitment the group may be better off if the Politics approach is
adopted. We investigate when Politics trumps Economics analytically, and then apply our model to
a survey of economists' views on the appropriate pure rate of time preference for project appraisal.
For a wide range of model parameters, and under both full and hidden information, the Politics approach
is supported by a majority of agents, and leads to higher group welfare.

Introduction

Many important decisions require groups of people with different time preferences to decide
how to manage a common asset. Examples abound: family members must decide on savings
and intra-household resource allocation, corporate partners must decide on investment and
dividend policy, communities with property rights over a natural resource must decide how
to manage it, and countries must decide how to manage sovereign wealth funds. In each
of these examples an asset is held in common and requires a dynamic management plan,
and the stake-holders in the decision very often have heterogeneous time preferences. How
should such decisions be made, given people’s different attitudes to time? This is the
subject of this paper.
The heterogeneity in people’s time preferences is now well documented. Frederick et al.
(2002) summarize the empirical literature, which uses experimental and field studies to
infer individuals’ rates of time preference. Estimates vary from -6%/yr to infinity across
the studies they cite, and within study variation in estimates is also large. These studies are
positive in nature – they tell us how people behave, and not how they think they, or society,
should behave for normative purposes. However, the time preferences economists prescribe
for normative applications, e.g. in public project appraisal (Arrow et al., 2013), are also
highly heterogeneous. This has been highlighted by the long-standing debate about the
appropriate rate of time preference for the evaluation of climate change policy (Nordhaus,
2008; Stern, 2007; Weitzman, 2007). A recent survey of economists who have published on
social discounting (Drupp et al., 2014) shows significant variation in prescriptions for the
pure rate of time preference, as demonstrated in Figure 1.1
The pervasive heterogeneity in attitudes to time raises difficulties for collective decisionmaking. Strotz (1955) and Koopmans (1960) showed the necessity of a single constant discount rate2 for time-consistent choice in the standard discounted utilitarian model. Jackson

The debate over the appropriate pure rate of time preference for public choices stretches back at least as
far as the seminal contribution of Ramsey (1928), who argued that ‘discounting of future utilities is ethically
indefensible and arises purely from a weakness of the imagination.’ Nevertheless, Ramsey acknowledged
that many might disagree with this ethical prescription (see also Arrow, 1999), and considered positive
rates of time preference too. Koopmans (1969) famously observed that very low rates of time preference
can lead to the ‘paradox of the indefinitely postponed splurge’, in which the current generation saves 100%
of its income, bankrupting itself for the sake of its descendants. Subsequent commentators have argued
the merits of a variety of discount rates without a clear ‘best’ value emerging, and different governments
have adopted different values for public decision-making.

Throughout the paper we use the term ‘discount rate’ to refer to the pure rate of time preference, i.e.
the discount rate on utility. The discount rate on consumption will be referred to as the ‘real discount
rate’.

& Yariv (2012, 2014) build on these insights to shows that methods of aggregating individual time preferences that are efficient cannot be time consistent.3 Their work highlights
the difficulties that arise in group decision making when people disagree about time; our
paper examines possible solutions to these intertemporal conflicts.
We focus on a problem in which a group of agents who are identical except for their
time preferences must decide how to manage a common asset. The group must choose
a collective decision rule that specifies both how much is consumed in aggregate at each
point in time, and how to divide consumption between individuals. We examine two
natural methods for making such decisions: an ‘Economics’ method, in which the decision
rule specifies all aspects of the allocation, and seeks to implement an efficient plan, and
a ‘Politics’ method, in which the rule only specifies an income share for each agent, and
agents then vote on the group’s aggregate consumption plan.
If full information about agents’ time preferences is available, and the group commits to
always evaluate intertemporal plans from the perspective of social preferences at an initial

Our concept of time consistency is the same as that in Strotz (1955), and is a special case of Koopmans
(1960); Jackson & Yariv (2014). Let X ∗ (T, τ ) denote an optimal action T units of time in the future as
prescribed at calendar time τ . Then time consistency requires that for all τ1 , τ2 such that τ2 > τ1 , and all
T ≥ 0, X ∗ (T, τ2 ) = X ∗ (T + (τ2 − τ1 ), τ1 ).

Table 1: The four versions of our model of intertemporal conflict. Information about
agents’ preferences varies across the columns of the table, and ability to commit to intertemporal plans varies across the rows. Economics implements a first-best optimum
under full information and if commitment is possible. However, in each of the three other
versions of the model it is unclear a priori whether an Economics or Politics approach to
resolving intertemporal conflicts will lead to higher group welfare.
time τ = 0, the Economics approach implements first-best allocations, and thus trivially
leads to higher group welfare than the Politics approach. These efficient allocations, and
the representative collective time preferences that emerge from them, have been studied
by Gollier & Zeckhauser (2005) and Heal & Millner (2013).4 However, since this decision
rule is efficient, it cannot be time consistent unless commitment is possible (Jackson &
Yariv, 2012). In addition, implementing a given point on the Pareto frontier generically
requires full information about agents’ preferences. It is thus natural to ask what happens
if we relax the commitment and full information assumptions, one by one. This leads us
to contrast Economics with Politics in the four versions of the model summarized in Table
1.
Retaining the commitment assumption, but assuming that agents’ preferences are hidden information, allocations are tightly constrained by the requirements of incentive compatibility in both the Economics and Politics approaches. The effects of these constraints
on individuals’ preferences between the two approaches, and the group’s welfare, could in
principle go either way. Although the incentive compatible Economics approach is still
Pareto efficient, we show that it corresponds to a particular choice of Pareto weights, and
could thus lead to lower group welfare than Politics if a different set of weights is used to
evaluate outcomes. Despite this possibility, we show that the Economics approach Pareto
dominates the Politics approach in both full and hidden information versions of the model
with commitment. Thus if commitment is possible, a ‘technocratic’ welfare economics
4
The efficient allocations in our model can replicate any market equilibrium in which agents trade
claims on future consumption, assuming that complete futures markets exist. The market mechanism
does not however alleviate incentive problems, as agents’ initial endowments determine the equilibrium.
Any allocation of endowments will lead to an efficient equilibrium, but this may not be the collectively
desired outcome if agents’ preferences are hidden information. The market equilibrium will also not be
welfare optimal unless the group commits to evaluating welfare with τ = 0 social preferences. See further
discussion below.

based approach to resolving intertemporal conflicts is the clear winner, regardless of the
weights assigned to individual agents’ welfare.
Without the commitment assumption, the allocations in the Economics approach are
not implementable, and the group will rationally discard them. Rather, if they seek to implement efficient allocations, they will choose the best current allocations they can, given
the allocation strategy they will follow in the future. This induces a dynamic game between
the current and future selves of the group (Phelps & Pollak, 1968). The Markov Perfect
Equilibrium of this game is time-consistent and intratemporally efficient, but intertemporally inefficient. We show that the equilibrium of the Politics approach is intertemporally
efficient, and thus also time consistent, but intratemporally inefficient. Thus without commitment the choice between Economics and Politics boils down to a horse-race between two
different inefficiencies, one across time (Economics), the other between agents (Politics).
The question is, under what conditions will one dominate the other? Asking this question
under both full and hidden information scenarios leads to the two versions of the model in
the second row of Table 1.
To begin to answer this question we derive analytic conditions that determine when
Politics trumps Economics under both informational scenarios, assuming that agents’ have
logarithmic utility functions, and for a choice of welfare weights that ensures that agents
are treated equally on all constant consumption paths. Under full information we show
that Politics is always preferred by a majority of agents, and leads to higher group welfare,
for a large and empirically relevant class of distributions for agents’ discount rates. Under
hidden information we are able to show that for any distribution of discount rates, and
any model parameters, Politics is always preferred by a majority of agents. However
the welfare contest between the two approaches is tighter in this case. To investigate
these findings further we apply our analysis to the empirical sample of discount rates in
Figure 1 for a wider set of utility functions. We find that Politics always leads to higher
group welfare under full information, and also for an empirically relevant range of model
parameters under hidden information. Thus, the results we obtained under commitment
are partially overturned – if commitment is not possible the group will often be better off if
the collective decision rule does not seek to implement efficient plans, but instead submits
aggregate consumption decisions to a vote.
Our work relates to three strands of literature. The most closely related work deals
with the aggregation of time preferences, or real (i.e. consumption) discount rates more
generally. The efficient approach to aggregating time preferences was originally explored

5

by Gollier & Zeckhauser (2005). They consider a model in which an exogenous common
stream of consumption is divided between heterogeneous agents efficiently, and derive the
representative time preferences of the group. Generically the representative rate of time
preference is non-constant, reflecting the implicit commitment assumption that is necessary if the efficient equilibrium is to be implemented as a collective decision rule. Thus this
work does not address the time inconsistency problem explicitly, and also assumes that
agents’ preferences are public information. Similarly, Li & Löfgren (2000) explore the consequences of efficient time preference aggregation in a public goods setting with endogenous
resource management. They too assume full commitment, and information and incentive
problems do not arise in their work, which is motivated via the purely normative intertemporal decision criterion of Chichilnisky (1996).5 A parallel literature in finance investigates
representative time preferences when agents make private decisions and interact through
the market (e.g. Lengwiler, 2005; Cvitanić et al., 2012). Although representative time
preferences are in general declining in this case, there is no time inconsistency problem, as
each agents’ individual decisions are time consistent. The tension between efficiency and
time consistency arises only in collective decisions that attempt to reflect a variety of time
preferences (Jackson & Yariv, 2012).
A related literature, stemming from the work of Weitzman (2001), focuses on aggregation of real discount rates, rather than pure rates of time preference. Weitzman takes
a sample of opinions as to the appropriate (constant) real discount rate, treats these as
uncertain estimates of the ‘true’ underlying rate, and takes expectations of the associated discount factors to derive a declining term structure for the ‘certainty equivalent’ real
discount rate. As Freeman & Groom (2014) observe, opinions about real discount rates
conflate ethical views about welfare parameters (e.g. the pure rate of time preference)
with empirical estimates of consumption growth rates – they mix tastes and beliefs. This
suggests that it is important to pursue approaches that treat preference aggregation as a
distinct problem, before addressing the issue of empirical uncertainty. Our work contributes
to this task.6
The second strand of literature studies time preference aggregation empirically. Several papers (e.g. Mazzocco, 2007; Adams et al., 2014) have developed revealed preference
5

The importance of the commitment assumption in this context has recently been explored by Asheim
& Ekeland (2014).
6
Weitzman’s insistence that his survey participants provide a constant value for the real discount rate
has also been criticized (Dasgupta, 2001, pp. 187-190). We avoid these issues by focussing only on collective
choices when people disagree about the pure rate of time preference. Individuals have good reasons for
preferring constant values of this parameter in normative applications.

methodologies for identifying how households’ collective decisions reflect their members’
time preferences, and intra-household decision-making power. Microdata on household
expenditures are used to estimate models of collective decision-making, and test which
assumptions about individual time preferences and household decision-making rationalize
the data. In a complimentary approach, Jackson & Yariv (2014) study a choice experiment
in which representative ‘planners’ are asked to decide between different public consumption streams for a group of other participants. They find that most planners are timeinconsistent due to their desire to aggregate the group’s time preferences. In contrast to
these positive studies, our work takes a normative approach to the problem of collective
dynamic choice, asking which methods groups might wish to use to resolve intertemporal
conflicts.
Finally, our work relates to a diverse literature on disadvantageous power in second-best
settings. In the version of our model without commitment the collective decision rule controls all aspects of decision making in the Economics approach, but control over aggregate
consumption decisions is relinquished in the Politics approach. Nevertheless, the group
may realize higher welfare under Politics than under Economics. Without commitment
we are in a second-best world, and the constrained efficient equilibrium in the Economics
approach may be improved upon by giving up some decision-making power to the agents
themselves. This finding has analogues in the theory of market power (Salant et al., 1983;
Maskin & Newbery, 1990), international cooperation (Rogoff, 1985), and government regulation (Krusell et al., 2002).
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets out the basic structure of the model
we employ. Section 3 develops the Economics approach to resolving intertemporal conflicts, first treating the case of commitment before characterizing the equilibrium of the
dynamic game that arises in the version of the model without commitment. Both full and
hidden information versions of the model are developed in each of these cases. Section
3 develops the Politics approach, and derives the equilibrium that emerges when agents
vote over dynamic aggregate consumption plans. Again, the model is analyzed in both
full and hidden information scenarios. Section 4 compares Economics to Politics in each of
the four versions of the model in Table 1. Several general results are obtained, as well as
some analytic results under specific parametric assumptions. Section 5 applies the results
of the previous sections to the empirical sample of discount rates in Figure 1, and investigates when Politics trumps Economics over a wide range of model parameters. Section 6
concludes.

The setting

We assume a set of N agents indexed by i, each of whom has idiosyncratic discount rate
δi ∈ [0, ∞).7 To focus on the core issue of intertemporal conflict we assume away all
other sources of heterogeneity between agents. In particular, they have a common utility
function

U (c) =

Thus if agent i is allocated a consumption path cit at time t in the future, his realized
welfare computed at time τ is

The group of agents derives consumption from a common asset or resource S, which grows
at constant rate r. The resource thus evolves according to
Ṡt = rSt −

and the initial value of the resource stock at time τ = 0 is S0 .
A collective decision rule must specify how to distribute consumption between agents
over time, taking into account the heterogeneity in their discount rates. We assume that
the group has an opinion as to how much weight to place on agent i’s welfare, denoted by
P
wi > 0, ( i wi = 1). To ensure that the welfare integrals in (2) always converge we assume
η ≥ 1 in (1).8
In what follows it will sometimes be useful to use shorthand notation, which we collect
7

The assumption of idiosyncratic discount rates greatly simplifies notation, but all our results can be
easily extended to the case where agents share discount rates. A distribution of discount rates in which
some agents share values of δ may also be arbitrarily closely approximated by a distribution in which
discount rates are idiosyncratic by adding a small amount of of noise to each discount rate.
8
All our results may be extended to η < 1 by placing appropriate restrictions on the model parameters,
but no additional restrictions are needed for η ≥ 1. Since η ≥ 1 in empirical applications we focus on this
case, but comment on the case η < 1 in the appendices.

Economics

In this section we describe an approach to resolving intertemporal conflicts based on traditional welfare economics. In this approach the group seeks to allocate consumption
between agents and over time efficiently. The decision rule thus maximizes a weighted sum
of agents’ intertemporal welfare integrals. If commitment to intertemporal allocations is
possible, and agents’ discount rates are public information, any Pareto efficient allocation
can be implemented. We initially describe this efficient equilibrium, and show that it is
only implementable if commitment is possible. We then relax both the full information
and commitment assumptions. If agents’ true discount rates are private information, they
will in general have incentives to lie about their discount rates. In the case of commitment
we show that if a special rule for determining agents’ consumption allocations is used they
will be incentive compatible in dominant strategies. We then study the group’s allocation
problem without commitment. Following in the tradition established by Phelps & Pollak (1968), we treat the problem as a dynamic game – the group still seeks to maximize
a weighted sum of agents’ intertemporal welfare, but knows that its ‘future selves’ will
make different decisions to the ones it would like. It thus chooses the best allocations it
can, given the decisions these future selves will make. We describe the Markov Perfect
Equilibrium of this game, and analyze the constraints incentive compatibility imposes on
equilibrium allocations in this case. The section thus provides a complete description of
the ‘Economics’ approach, both with and without commitment, and with full and hidden

The superscript E in WiE reminds us that this is the welfare agent i receives when
consumption allocations are efficient.
10

This proposition relies on the assumption that the group commits to implementing an
efficient plan at time τ = 0.9 To see this, let agent L have the lowest discount rate, δL .
From (9) we see that the ratio of agent i 6= L’s consumption to agent L’s consumption at
time t is proportional to e−(δi −δL )t/η . This ratio is decreasing in time for all i 6= L. Thus,
regardless of the choice of welfare weights, an increasing share of aggregate consumption
is allocated to the agent with the lowest discount rate as time passes.10 While such an
allocation is efficient at time τ = 0, it is not time-consistent without the commitment
assumption, as the group will want to allocate consumption to impatient agents if it is
allowed to revise its plan at a later time. The necessity of commitment is also reflected in
the representative discount rate (12), which decreases monotonically to the lowest discount
rate (Heal & Millner, 2013). Only constant discount rates lead to time consistent optimal
plans in the absence of commitment (Strotz, 1955).
Sticking with the commitment assumption for the moment, we now ask how hidden
information about agents’ time preferences constrains which efficient allocations are implementable.11 If full information about agents’ discount rates is available the choice of
consumption allocations is unconstrained. By contrast, under hidden information, agents
have incentives to lie about the value of their discount rate. As an example suppose that
wi = 1/N for all i. In this case (9) shows that agents’ consumption paths are Pareto ordered, with the agent with the lowest discount rate receiving a path that Pareto dominates
the allocation of the agent with the next lowest discount rate, and so on. Thus, all agents
have an incentive to announce the lowest possible discount rate, regardless of their true discount rate. If the group wishes to avoid such incentive problems, while still implementing
Pareto efficient allocations, its choice of allocations will be tightly constrained. It needs to
ensure that all agents cannot improve their welfare (computed with respect to their true
discount rate δi ) by announcing a different discount rate δi0 . This can be achieved if a spe9

The efficient allocations in this proposition can be decentralized if complete futures markets exist.
The commitment assumption is not necessary in a market context, as decisions are made by individual
time consistent agents, and not by a decision rule that aggregates agents’ preferences to make a social
decision. The welfare weights {wi } can be mapped to agents’ initial endowments, and trading at t = 0
leads to an efficient and time consistent market equilibrium. While this equilibrium will clearly be Pareto
efficient, it will not be welfare optimal from the perspective of a future social planner unless we commit
to evaluating allocations using τ = 0 social preferences. If a future planner at τ > 0 continued to evaluate
agents’ intertemporal welfare according to (2), she would want to reallocate their current endowments and
reopen the market. If she rationally anticipates all such future reallocations the resulting set of market
equilibria will correspond to the equilibrium of the dynamic game we study in the following sub-section.
10
Heal & Millner (2013) prove this in much more general models than the one we’re considering.
11
We focus on incentive compatibility in dominant strategies. Aside from being the simplest, strongest,
and most practically useful form of incentive compatibility, this ensures comparability between the Economics and Politics approaches, as we show below.

cific rule for mapping agents’ announced discount rates into their consumption allocations
is used:
Proposition 2. The efficient allocations in (9) will be incentive compatible in dominant
strategies if and only if an agent who announces discount rate δi is assigned Pareto weight
(δi + (η − 1)r)η
wi = P
.
η
j (δj + (η − 1)r)

(13)

Proof. See Appendix B.
The intuition for the qualitative features of this result can be understood as follows. In
order to avoid the Pareto ordering of consumption streams that obtained in our example
of efficient allocation when the welfare weights are equal, it is necessary for the weights
to be adjusted in favor of agents with high discount rates. In particular, it should always
be the case that an agent with a high discount rate δh receives a larger initial share of
consumption than an agent with a lower discount rate δl < δh , and agent h’s consumption
should fall faster than l’s. Inspection of the formula (9) shows that this constrains the
welfare weights to be increasing in δi , as in (13). But this is not sufficient for incentive
compatibility in dominant strategies. We also require that agents’ realized welfare should
not depend on the discount rate announcements of other agents. Appendix B demonstrates
that the weights in (13) are the unique Pareto weights that achieve this.

3.2

No Commitment

We now consider the case where intertemporal commitments are not possible. In this
case a planner at time τ1 who wants to implement an efficient policy knows that at time
τ2 > τ1 her ‘future self’ will implement what she views as the best consumption allocation.
However, the allocation that the time τ2 planner makes will not coincide with what the
τ1 planner would have liked. For example, the planner at τ1 would like to assign weight
wi e−δi (τ2 −τ1 ) to agent i’s welfare at time τ2 when deciding on consumption allocations, but
from the perspective of the planner at τ2 the appropriate weight on agent i’s welfare at
time τ2 is just wi . Hence the time inconsistency problem.
The traditional economics approach to solving models of intertemporal choice with
time inconsistent preferences is to treat them as a dynamic game between current and
future selves (Phelps & Pollak, 1968). This method has become the norm in a host of
applications including consumer behavior (Laibson, 1997), growth theory (Barro, 1999),
12

political economics (Persson & Tabellini, 2000), and environmental economics (Karp, 2005).
In this approach the planner at τ1 rationally anticipates the consumption allocations of her
future selves at all τ2 > τ1 . She makes the best decision she can, subject to what these
future selves will do. This induces a dynamic game between current and future selves, and
we look for Markov Perfect Equilibria (MPEs) of this game. Since equilibrium strategies
are conditioned only on payoff relevant state variables, and not on calendar time, they will
be time consistent.
A Markov allocation rule in our context is a profile of state dependent functions P =
{σi (S)} such that cit = σi (St ) for all t ≥ τ . A profile is an MPE if, in the limit as  → 0,
when planners at times t ∈ [τ + , ∞) in the future use profile P , the best response of the
current planner in t ∈ [τ, τ + ) is also to use P . The fact that we are after a profile of N
allocation rules raises considerable computational problems if we take a direct approach to
deriving the equilibrium conditions.12 However, it is possible to reduce the problem to one
that only requires us to solve for a single unknown function. The key observation is that the
current planner only influences what happens in the future through her choice of aggregate
consumption – how she distributes a given level Cτ of current aggregate consumption across
agents has no effect on the actions of future planners, and her stream of future welfare.
This is so since future allocations depend only on the state St , which is affected only by
aggregate consumption decisions. Since the actions of future selves are independent of the
distribution of current consumption, the current planner will rationally allocate whatever
consumption Cτ she chooses between the agents so as to maximize their current collective
welfare. Specifically, given any (as yet unknown) choice of aggregate consumption Cτ , the
current planner chooses ciτ to maximize

Thus, in equilibrium, the planner will always allocate a share w̃i of aggregate consumption
to agent i at each point in time. This implies that the equilibrium allocation to agent

For example, if we look for a linear equilibrium in which the profile of allocation rules takes the form
σi (S) = ai S, the equilibrium conditions for the set of N coefficients {ai } are a coupled nonlinear system
of N algebraic equations.

i must satisfy σi (S) = w̃i σ(S) for some function σ(St ), where aggregate consumption is
given by Ct = σ(St ). Clearly, for each τ , the planner views her current allocations at time
τ as intratemporally efficient.
Now we need to solve for the equilibrium aggregate consumption rule σ(S). To do this,
note that the value the planner at t = τ gets from aggregate consumption Ct consumed by
the group at time t ≥ τ is:

the problem is to find the MPE of a modified single agent problem with utility function
Ũ (C) and discount factor β(t), and where the resource stock evolves according to Ṡt =
rSt − Ct .
An immediate question that arises is whether there is a unique MPE in this dynamic
game. In general models with non-constant discount rates admit a continuum of MPEs
(Krusell & Smith, 2003; Karp, 2007; Ekeland & Lazrak, 2010). If however we view our
model as the infinite time horizon limit of a set of finite horizon games, the equilibrium is
unique, and coincides with the linear MPE (see e.g. Krusell et al., 2002).13 We thus focus
on the linear equilibrium, which is characterized in the following proposition:
Proposition 3.
1. The linear MPE of the modified planner’s problem without commitment is given by an aggregate consumption rule Ct = σ(St ) = ASt , where A satisfies


A
δi + (η − 1)(r − A)


= 1.

2. The aggregate consumption path in the linear MPE is equivalent to the optimal path
of a time-consistent planner with discount rate
δN C := r + η(A − r).

A proof of this claim for our specific model is available on request.

Proof. See Appendix C.
The superscript “NC” on WiN C reminds us that this is the welfare agent i realizes
in the ‘No Commitment’ version of the model. Note that although the equilibrium is
observationally equivalent to the time-consistent equilibrium associated with discount rate
δN C , it is not intertemporally efficient, as originally observed by Phelps & Pollak (1968).
δN C is an artificial construct, and the equilibrium does not correspond to the optimal
consumption plan of any of the individuals the planner is attempting to represent.
Understanding the constraints that incentive compatibility imposes on consumption
allocations is simpler in this case than in the version of the model with commitment.
Under full information the choice of welfare weights is again unconstrained. To analyze
incentives under hidden information, notice that each agent gets a constant share w̃i of
aggregate consumption at each point in time in equilibrium. Thus the consumption streams
allocated to agents will be Pareto ranked if the w̃i are not equal, leading to incentive
problems. If we set w̃i = 1/N , although all agents now receive the same allocation, they
may still have incentives to lie about their discount rates so as to manipulate the aggregate
consumption path to their advantage. We will assume that N is large, so that each agent’s
announced discount rate has a negligible effect on the value of A, and thus the aggregate
consumption path.14 In this case, provided that w̃i = 1/N , all agents’ realized welfare is
exogenous to their announced discount rate, and they gain nothing by lying.

Politics

In this section we present an alternative method for resolving intertemporal conflicts. In
contrast to the Economics approach described above, this method requires the collective
decision rule to cede some control over consumption allocations to agents themselves. In14

Technically, we also require an (arbitrarily large, but finite) upper bound on permissible discount rate
announcements.

15

stead of prescribing the group’s aggregate consumption, a political institution is established
for deciding on intertemporal consumption plans in this approach.
The political approach requires the group to choose a set of constant income shares
si , so that agent i receives a share si of aggregate consumption at all times. The si are
endogenously determined, either from welfare considerations or from incentive constraints,
as we explain below. Agents are then allowed to nominate an aggregate consumption plan
for the group to follow. All agents vote over each pair of nominated plans, and the plan
that gets a majority of votes wins each pairwise contest. A Condorcet winner (if it exists) is
a plan that wins every pairwise contest. If there is a Condorcet winner, it is implemented.
In general, voting over arbitrary consumption plans can lead to intransitive collective
choices (Jackson & Yariv, 2012). If however we restrict attention to votes over aggregate
consumption plans that are optimal for a given agent, the problem has a lot more structure,
and a unique Condorcet winner exists under mild conditions, as we now show.
Let the optimal aggregate consumption plan of an agent with discount rate δi be C(δi ) =
δi
(Ct )t≥0 . Agent i’s consumption at time t under such a plan is si Ctδi . Thus C(δi ) is the
solution of
Z ∞
U (si Ct )e−δi t dt s.t. Ṡt = rSt − Ct .
(21)

We are interested in agents’ preferences over the set of optimal plans {C(δi )}. We begin
with a lemma:
Lemma 1. Suppose that:
1. Initial optimal aggregate consumption C0δ is an increasing function of δ.
2. Each pair of aggregate consumption paths {C(δ), C(δ 0 )} has exactly one intersection
point, i.e. for any δ 0 > δ, there exists a time T such that
0

∀t > 0, (T − t)(Ctδ − Ctδ ) > 0.
Then all agents have single-peaked preferences over optimal aggregate consumption paths.
Proof. See Appendix D.
Using this lemma, we have the following result:
Proposition 4. The unique Condorcet winner of a vote over optimal aggregate consumption plans is the optimal plan of the median agent, with discount rate δm .
16

Proof. Since the utility function is iso-elastic, agents’ preferences over optimal aggregate
consumption plans are independent of their income shares si . So we can set si = 1 for all i,
and focus on individually optimal consumption plans. Theorem 2 in Becker (1983) shows
that optimal initial aggregate consumption is an increasing function of δ for any concave
production function. As t → ∞, the path C(δ) tends to zero if δ > r, and +∞ if δ < r.
Thus the limiting value of Ctδ is non-increasing in δ. In addition, all optimal consumption
paths are monotonic functions of time (see e.g. Kamien & Schwartz, 1991). All pairs of
consumption paths must therefore cross exactly once. The two conditions of Lemma 1 are
thus satisfied, and agents have single-peaked preferences over optimal plans. Application
of the classic results of Black (1948) then yields the result.15
Our analysis of the voting equilibrium has thus far assumed that there is a once-off
vote on the aggregate consumption plan at time τ = 0. One could also allow agents to
vote over aggregate consumption in each period. In this case the problem of proving that
agents’ preferences over aggregate consumption are single peaked is simpler, and it can
be shown that the same equilibrium would obtain in this case.16 The political mechanism
for resolving intertemporal conflicts is time consistent, as aggregate consumption decisions
are determined by a single discount rate δm . Moreover, since the aggregate consumption
path associated with δm is also an optimal path for the median agent, the equilibrium is
intertemporally efficient. In contrast to allocations determined by the Economics mechanism however, allocations determined by the Politics mechanism are not intratemporally
efficient – the group’s instantaneous welfare at any time t could be increased by redistributing aggregate consumption between the agents. Doing so however would require agents’
consumption shares to vary with time, and thus lead us back to a time inconsistency
problem.
Given that aggregate consumption is determined by the median agent’s preferred policy
15

The proof is no more difficult for an arbitrary concave production function F (S) that admits an interior
steady state. In this case the steady state value of consumption on a path C(δ) is given by F ((F 0 )−1 (δ)),
which by the concavity of F , is again a non-increasing function of δ. The rest of the proof goes through
unchanged.
16
Consider a discrete time, finite horizon version of our model. Then by using backwards induction the
problem reduces to proving single peakedness for a sequence of static consumption choices, rather than for
a full dynamic plan (Boylan & McKelvey, 1995). Taking an infinite horizon and infinitesimal time step
limit of this result extends it to our continuous time model.

Incentive compatibility imposes constraints on the choice of income shares {si } in the
political mechanism. As in the Economics mechanism, any income shares are feasible when
agents’ discount rates are public information. If the group is rational, it will choose these
shares to maximize collective welfare computed with the welfare weights wi , given that
aggregate consumption will be determined by the median voter’s preferred plan:

These income shares are As Efficient As Possible (AEAP), given that control of aggregate
consumption decisions has been given up.17 The set of AEAP income shares is uniquely
specified, given any set of welfare weights {wi }. Crucially, the AEAP income shares are
independent of the current level of the resource stock St . This means that the time consistency of the voting equilibrium is preserved with this choice of income shares. If we
allowed revision of the choice of income shares at a later period they would not change.
Under hidden information, the choice of income shares is tightly constrained if incentive
problems are to be avoided. Since the consumption allocated to each agent is Pareto
ordered (higher income shares Pareto dominate lower income shares), the only way to
ensure incentive compatibility is to choose si = 1/N for all i. In this case, the median
voter equilibrium is well known to be incentive compatible in dominant strategies (e.g.
Moulin, 1980).18

is always real and positive if r ≥ δm when η ≥ 1.
Note that even though agents’ preferences over aggregate consumption are single peaked for any si ,
individual allocations are only incentive compatible when income shares are equal. This is different to the
standard result on the strategy-proofness of the median voter equilibrium with single-peaked preferences.
In the setup of the standard result all agents always receive the same outcome from a policy selection,
whereas in our case agents’ outcomes are differentiated for non-equal income shares.

Economics vs. Politics

In this section we compare the Economics and Politics mechanisms in each of the four
versions of our model in Table 1. We will show that if commitment is possible Economics
dominates Politics, under both full and hidden information. By contrast, Politics may well
be preferred by the majority of agents, and yield higher group welfare than Economics, if
commitment is not possible. In the case of no commitment, our task will be to characterize
the conditions under which one mechanism trumps the other.
We will compare Economics with Politics using two metrics: which mechanism does
the majority of agents prefer, and which mechanism leads to higher group welfare? The
first criterion is an ordinal measure that reflects the group’s political preferences – which
method would win a majoritarian ‘meta-vote’ between the two alternatives? The second
criterion is a cardinal measure that tells us which mechanism leaves the group better off,
given a choice of welfare weights {wi }.

5.1

Commitment

In the case of full information, it is trivially true that regardless of the choice of welfare
weights {wi }, the group will be better off under Economics than under Politics. In the
Economics mechanism an unconstrained optimum can be implemented, which dominates
all other allocations by definition. While we immediately know that Economics guarantees
higher group welfare, the following result tells us something much stronger:
Proposition 5. Commitment, full information: All agents strictly prefer the Economics
mechanism to the Politics mechanism with AEAP income shares (23).
Proof. See Appendix E.
This result holds for any welfare weights {wi }. Thus, not only does the Economics
mechanism lead to higher group welfare, it also has the unanimous support of all agents.
Under hidden information, both the Economics mechanism and the Politics mechanism
are tightly constrained. There is a unique set of welfare weights in the Economics mechanism, and a unique set of income shares in the Politics mechanism, that induce dominant
strategy incentive compatible consumption allocations. Given these constraints on feasible allocations, it is a priori possible that if the group’s welfare is evaluated using a set
of weights wi0 , it could be better off under Politics than Economics, despite the former’s
inefficiency. However, the following proposition rules out this possibility:
19

Proposition 6. Commitment, hidden information: All agents strictly prefer the incentive
compatible Economics mechanism to the incentive compatible Politics mechanism, except
the median agent, who is indifferent.
Proof. See Appendix F.
Once again, Economics receives unanimous support, regardless of the choice of welfare
weights. Thus, the superiority of Economics over Politics holds under both full and hidden
information versions of the model when intertemporal commitments are possible.

5.2

No commitment

The previous sub-section showed that Economics is a clear winner under the assumption
that commitment is possible. We now consider a setting in which the group cannot commit
to evaluating collective welfare with respect to social preferences at time τ = 0. We again
compare the two mechanisms in both full and hidden information scenarios, and show that
the results we obtained under commitment are often reversed.
5.2.1

Full Information

In order to analyze the tradeoff between Economics and Politics in detail in this case it is
necessary to specify the welfare weights wi . We use a specific choice, which we will refer
to as ‘equitable’ weights:
δi
(24)
wi = P .
j δj
This choice ensures that if every agent is allocated the same constant consumption path
cit = c, each agent makes an equal contribution to group welfare. This follows since agent
i’s welfare on constant consumption paths is
Z
Wi =

∞

U (c)e−δi (t−τ ) dt = U (c)/δi .

(25)

τ

Thus wi Wi is equal for all i on constant paths when the equitable welfare weights (24) are
chosen.
To make initial analytical headway it is also helpful to specialize to the case η = 1, as
the equilibrium condition (18) is analytically solvable in this case. Substituting η = 1 and
(24) into the expression (23) for the AEAP income shares in the Politics model, we see

20

that

1
.
(26)
N
Thus, for this choice of welfare weights, the welfare maximizing income shares in the Politics
mechanism distribute income equally amongst all agents.
Using this finding, the formula for the equitable welfare weights (24), and the expressions (20) and (22) for agent’s welfare under Economics and Politics, we can calculate
agents’ individual welfares, and the group’s collective welfare, under the two approaches.
The results of these calculations are summarized in the following proposition:
s∗i =

Proposition 7. No commitment, full information: Assume that η = 1, and equitable
welfare weights (24). Define
zi := δi /δm .
(27)
1. Politics is preferred to Economics by a majority of agents if and only if hzi i > 1 (i.e.
the δi are positively skewed). If hzi i = 1 (i.e. the δi are symmetrically distributed),
the population is evenly split between the two mechanisms.
2. Group welfare is higher under Politics than under Economics if and only if
hln zi i < (hzi i − 1)hzi−1 i.

(28)

3. A mean-preserving spread in zi decreases the difference between group welfare under
Economics and group welfare under Politics.
Proof. See Appendix G.
The first point in the proposition show that the group’s ordinal preferences between
the two mechanisms are entirely captured by the skewness of the distribution of δi –
at least a majority prefers Politics (Economics) if δi is positively (negatively) skewed.
Welfare preferences between the two mechanisms are characterized by points 2 and 3
of the proposition. As condition (28) demonstrates, welfare comparisons depend on the
distribution of δi in a complex manner in general. The following proposition shows however
that for a large class of distributions sharper results are possible:
Proposition 8. No commitment, full information: Assume that η = 1, equitable welfare
weights, and that δi is log-symmetrically distributed. Then
1. The majority of agents prefers Politics to Economics.
21

2. Group welfare is higher under Politics than Economics.
Proof. Since ln δi is symmetrically distributed by assumption, ln zi = ln(δi /δm ) is also
symmetrically distributed. In addition, we must have hln zi i = 0. This follows since, by
definition, the median of zi is 1. Since ln zi is symmetric, the median of zi is also equal to
ehln zi i , and hence hln zi i = 0. Thus since 0 = hln zi i < lnhzi i by the concavity of the log,
we must have hzi i > 1. By Proposition 7.2, we conclude that the majority always prefers
Politics. The condition (28), which determines when Politics yields higher group welfare,
becomes
0 < (hzi i − 1)hzi−1 i.
But since zi > 0 for all i, and we have shown hzi i > 1, this inequality is always satisfied.
Thus for log-symmetric distributions of δi – a classic example being the log-normal distribution – the group would favor a Political approach to resolving intertemporal conflicts,
both in welfare terms, and in a majoritarian meta-vote between the two mechanisms.
The feature of log-symmetric distributions that delivers this result is that they are
always strongly positively skewed, with a long upper tail of values above the median.
Figure 1 shows that this is an empirically plausible property. Large outliers are a significant
presence for these distributions. To gain intuition for why Politics will tend to be favored
for distributions with large outliers, it is helpful to study the group’s representative time
preferences under the two approaches. Substituting η = 1 into (18) and (19), we see that
the group’s aggregate consumption path in the Economics approach is equivalent to the
optimal path of a time consistent agent with discount rate
δN C |η=1 = hδi−1 i−1
wi .

(29)

With equitable welfare weights, this becomes
δN C |η=1 = hδi i.

(30)

Thus aggregate behavior is controlled by the mean discount rate in the Economics approach, and the median discount rate in the Politics approach. It is well known that outliers have a disproportionately large effect on the mean of a distribution, but will have no
effect on its median. Thus, if the distribution of discount rates is highly positively skewed,
the representative discount rate in the Economics approach will be biased upwards relative
to the median. By contrast, the Politics approach is comparatively unaffected by outliers –
22

the median is robust to their presence. Now consider how the two mechanisms determine
intratemporal allocations: income shares are equal under Politics, but proportional to δi
under Economics. Thus the Economics mechanism is doubly slanted towards high values
of δi when the distribution is strongly positively skewed – both intra- and intertemporally.
Since each agent’s realized welfare contributes to group welfare roughly equally for equitable welfare weights, this bias means that Economics is too sensitive to the needs of agents
with high δi .
This finding is further confirmed by point 3 of Proposition 7, which holds regardless of
the distribution of δi . To understand this result note that implementing a mean-preserving
spread in zi requires us to hold hδi i/δm fixed. We are thus holding a measure of the
skewness of the distribution of δi fixed, while increasing the spread in the distribution of
δi /δm . A simple example of a transformation of the distribution of δi that implements
this is as follows: Take an empirical sample of δi , divide each value by δm , apply a mean
preserving spread to the result, and finally multiple the resulting values by δm . It is clear
that this procedure pushes out the upper tails of the distribution of δi . Roughly speaking,
as the proportion of ‘outliers’ in the sample increases (holding the ratio of the mean to the
median fixed), Politics looks increasingly attractive relative to Economics.
Propositions 7.3 and 8 thus suggest that the more positively skewed the distribution
of δi , the more the Politics approach provides a better means of achieving consensus on
intertemporal plans, as it is less subject to the whims of large outliers. This will be born
out in our empirical application in Section 6, which also considers the case η > 1.
5.2.2

Hidden information

If agents’ discount rates are private information, allocations must be determined by choosing wi = 1/N in the Economics mechanism, and si = 1/N in the Politics mechanism, if
incentive problems are to be avoided. Thus, since agents receive equal constant income
shares under both mechanisms, their preferences between the approaches depend only on
the aggregate consumption plan that is implemented. Using this fact, we immediately
obtain the following result, which holds for all values of the model parameters:
Proposition 9. No commitment, hidden information: The majority of agents always
prefers Politics to Economics.
Proof. By Proposition 4, agents have single-peaked preferences over time consistent optimal aggregate consumption plans. Under Politics, agents’ allocations are determined by
23

an optimal plan corresponding to the median discount rate δm , and under Economics allocations are determined by an optimal plan corresponding to discount rate δN C . But the
median plan is a Condorcet winner, so at least a majority of agents prefer it to any other
time-consistent plan, including the plan corresponding to discount rate δN C .
Even though the majority of agents always prefers Politics, this doesn’t mean that the
group always realizes higher welfare under this mechanism, as the next proposition shows.
Proposition 10. No commitment, hidden information: Set η = 1, and suppose that incentive compatible allocations are evaluated using welfare weights qi . Then, Politics yields
higher group welfare than Economics if and only if



hzi−1 iqi
lnhzi−1 i > 1 − hzi−1 i−1
−2
hzi iqi

(31)

In the case of equitable welfare weights (qi ∝ δi ), Economics always yields higher group
welfare than Politics.
Proof. See Appendix H.
The proposition shows that the choice of η = 1 and equitable welfare weights for
evaluating incentive compatible allocations is very special – Economics always yields higher
welfare than Politics in this case. To understand this result note that with equitable
weights, equation (29) shows that the group’s representative discount rate is δN C |η=1 =
hδi−1 i−1 under Economics, and the representative discount rate is again δm under Politics.
Since hδi−1 i−1 is a generalized mean, Economics is again more sensitive to outliers than
Politics. However in the hidden information case aggregate consumption is necessarily split
equally between agents in both mechanisms – there is no ‘double bias’ in the Economics
approach. This can mean that sensitivity to outliers is a good thing – it can shift the
aggregate consumption path in a welfare enhancing direction.
There is however a complex interaction between the fact that more weight is placed on
the welfare of agents with high δi , that agents with high δi have intrinsically lower welfare
values when consumption shares are equal, and the different representative discount rates
that the two mechanisms prescribe. Only for equitable welfare weights do things work out
so that, regardless of the distribution of δi , Economics is always preferred. To illustrate the
non-robustness of this result, consider an example in which δi is log-normally distributed,
and the weights qi are chosen proportional to δi2 . In this case one can show that Politics will
24

always yield higher welfare than Economics.19 The dominance of Economics is also highly
non-robust to changes in the value of η. When η > 1, the group’s welfare is often higher
under Politics even for equitable welfare weights. We demonstrate this empirically in the
next section. Nevertheless, these results do suggest that in the hidden information case the
contest between Economics and Politics will be tighter than in the full information case,
even for strongly positively skewed distributions. This will be born out in our empirical
analysis.

6

Empirical Application

In order to move beyond the case η = 1, which was required for some of the results in the
previous section, it is necessary to use numerical methods to solve the equilibrium condition
(18) in the version of the Economics approach without commitment, given an empirical
distribution of discount rates. The distribution of discount rates we will use is taken from
the Drupp et al. (2014) survey. Economists who published on social discounting since the
year 2000 were asked for their opinions as to the appropriate values of the parameters of
the social discount rate, including the pure rate of time preference. 180 responses were
collected, and the distribution of opinions is shown in Figure 1.
To begin our analysis of the data, we plot the group’s representative discount rate in
each of the four versions of our model, assuming that the δi are distributed according to
the distribution in Figure 1, and for η = 2, r = 2%/yr, in Figure 2. The figure shows
the declining term structure of the representative discount rate under commitment, and
the constant representative rates δN C without commitment, assuming equitable welfare
weights. The group is more patient under hidden information than under full information
in both commitment scenarios. It is straightforward to understand this finding in the
case of no commitment. In this case, the welfare weights are proportional to δi under
full information, and uniform under hidden information. Thus more weight is placed on
high discount rates, and less on low discount rates, under full information.20 This causes
the group to be more impatient under full information. The result is more complex in
the case of commitment, as there is no simple stochastic dominance relationship between
the equitable welfare weights (24) and the incentive compatible weights (13). Empirically,
19

Log-normal distributions are log-symmetric, so by Proposition 8 we know that hzi i > 1. For qi ∝ zi2 ,

hzi−1 iqi
hzi−2 iqi

= hzi i. For log-normal distributions we also know that hzi−1 i = hzi i > 1, so that lnhzi−1 i > 0.

Substituting these relationships into (31), and using the fact that ln x > 1 − x−1 for all x, yields this result.
20
The two sets of weights are ranked by the monotone likelihood ratio order.

commitment, and Politics yields higher group welfare under both informational scenarios
without commitment.
we find that the incentive compatible weights are greater than the equitable weights for
δi ∈ [0, 0.65%] ∪ [6.17%, ∞), while the converse is true for δi ∈ [0.065%, 6.17%], when
η = 2, r = 2%/yr. Thus the hidden information welfare weights emphasize low and very
high discount rates, and down-weight intermediate values, relative to the full information
case. Since there are many more low discount rates than very high discount rates in
the sample (the median is 0.53%/yr), this suggests that the hidden information case will
correspond to less collective impatience than the full information case, as is born out in
Figure 2.
From Propositions 5 and 6, we know that all agents prefer Economics to Politics under
commitment. Without commitment, Proposition 7 showed that when η = 1, and with
equitable welfare weights (24), the majority of agents will prefer Politics if the distribution

of δi is positively skewed. The empirical distribution of δi is strongly positively skewed
(δm = 0.53%/yr < hδi i = 1.15%/yr), so we might expect this result to continue to hold.
Proposition 9 showed that the majority of agents always prefers Politics when information
is hidden. Figure 3 plots the percentage of agents who prefer Politics in both full and
hidden information versions of the model, for a range of values of r and η. A significant
supermajority prefers Politics in the full information version of the model for all parameter
values. Politics is also always preferred by the majority in the hidden information model,
as we expect, but the contest between the mechanisms is tighter in this case. The ordinal
preferences of the group are nevertheless clear: Politics would always win a ‘meta-vote’
between the two approaches if commitment is not possible.
We also find empirically that Politics leads to higher group welfare for all values of
η and r when commitment is not possible but full information is available about agents’
preferences. Thus the analytical result we obtained in Proposition 8 for log-symmetric
distributions and η = 1 continues to hold for our empirical sample, and when η > 1.
Figure 4 demonstrates this by plotting the percentage welfare loss, relative to the efficient
allocation under commitment, of the allocations under Economics without commitment,
and Politics. Politics always achieves a lower welfare loss. Both mechanisms perform better
relative to the efficient allocation for larger values of r.
Finally, Figure 5 plots the regions of the (η, r) parameter space where Politics yields
27

higher welfare under hidden information and no commitment, assuming that allocations
are evaluated using equitable welfare weights. The tradeoff between the two mechanisms
is tighter in this case, with Economics yielding higher welfare for some parameter values,
and Politics yielding higher welfare for others. Nevertheless, in contrast to the findings of
Proposition 10 with η = 1, Politics does better for many empirically plausible values of η
and r (e.g. η = 1.5, r ≈ 1 − 4%/yr, see Drupp et al. (2014)).

Conclusions

Collective decisions that involve groups of people with heterogeneous time preferences
must face up to an inherent tension between efficiency and time consistency if it is not
possible to make unbreakable commitments (Jackson & Yariv, 2012). Yet such decisions
are encountered in a host of real world contexts, from the smallest scales (families) to the
largest (countries). The democratic requirement that collective decisions should not be
executed by a de facto dictator leads us to seek methods of reaching agreement that reflect
the distribution of individuals’ views, despite the acknowledged difficulties of doing so.
Our paper has proposed two such methods, each rooted in long traditions in Economics
and Politics respectively. We have analyzed which of these approaches would be preferred
both when agents’ preferences are known and when they are not, and commitment to
intertemporal plans is, and is not, possible. The findings are stark: Economics trumps
Politics if commitment is possible. Without commitment, under many empirically plausible
model specifications, Politics trumps Economics.
These results have applications in many group decision problems. Take as an example
the problem of choosing a social (i.e. consumption) discount rate for public project appraisal. This parameter is probably the single most important economic input to many
public investment decisions. Many countries (including e.g. the USA, EU member states,
China, and India), have project evaluation guidelines that stipulate its value. These rules
affect billions of dollars of investment annually, and play an important role in determining
the set of public assets our generation will leave for the next. Owing to the restrictive
perfect market assumptions that are necessary to identify market interest rates with social
shadow prices, many government bodies (e.g. the US Congressional Budget Office, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the UK Treasury) use explicit welfare computations
to set the social discount rate via the famous Ramsey formula (see e.g. Gollier, 2012). The
pure rate of time preference is a crucial input to this formula, and can have a significant im-

pact on a country’s choice of social discount rate. Yet until now, prescriptions for its value
have been based on dictatorial value judgements, with one form of ethical reasoning given
precedence over all others. Given the importance of this choice for intertemporal resource
allocation, it would seem natural for governments to attempt to represent a variety of legitimate viewpoints, rather than putting all their ethical eggs in a single basket (Sen, 2010).
Doing so requires an engagement with the difficulties of temporal preference aggregation,
and a method for cutting through them. Our paper offers precisely such methods, and
allows us to select the ‘best’ approach, given the nature of the decision problem at hand.
In common resource settings, and when the government cannot commit (which is often the
relevant case), our analysis suggests that it may be appropriate to adopt a representative
pure rate of time preference of roughly 0.5%/yr. This is the median discount rate from the
Drupp et al. (2014) study, which corresponds to the equilibrium of the Politics approach.
We have shown that this leads to higher group welfare than the Economics approach for all
model parameters under full information, and also for empirically plausible parameter values under hidden information. Similar exercises could inform the management of sovereign
wealth funds, and natural resources.

where λt is the shadow price of the resource, and St evolves according to

A standard application of the Maximum principle yields
wi U 0 (cit )e−δi t = λt

(34)

λ̇t = −rλt .

Solving the equation for λt , and using the functional form (1) for the utility function, we
have

3) For a proof of this result see Heal & Millner (2013).

A.2

Politics

To solve for the agents’ equilibrium welfare under Politics, notice that agents’ income shares
si don’t affect their optimal aggregate consumption plans. To find the optimal plan of the
median agent, we may thus simply set wm = 1, wi = 0, i 6= m in (9) to find that aggregate
consumption is given by

Computing the integral explicitly using the utility function (1) yields (22).

A.3

Economics: No commitment

In the version of the Economics mechanism without commitment, we know that in equilibrium agent i receives a share w̃i of aggregate consumption, and that the aggregate
consumption path corresponds to the optimal path of a time-consistent agent with discount rate δN C . Thus the welfare agent i achieves in this mechanism is identical to her
welfare under Politics, except that we need to send si → w̃i , and δm → δN C in (22). Thus
agent i’s welfare in the no commitment model for η > 1 is simply

When η = 1 the equilibrium condition (18) may be solved explicitly, to find
A = hδi−1 i−1

(45)

Substituting η = 1 into (19), we see that δN C = hδi−1 i−1
wi . Using this expression in (22),
and sending si → wi , δm → δN C yields the result for η = 1.

Notice that the welfare weights only enter (47) through this factor, which is homogeneous
of degree zero in the wi , and thus independent of the normalization of the welfare weights.
For the choice of wi in (13), we have
wi
∝ (δi + (η − 1)r)η .
λ0

(49)

Plug (49) into (47), to find that
W (δi , δ 0 ) ∝

1
(δi + (η − 1)r)1−η
,
1 − η (r − δi )(η − 1) + ηδ 0

(50)

where the proportionality constant is positive. Differentiating explicitly with respect to δi ,
one finds that
∂W
= sgn(δ 0 − δi )
(51)
sgn
∂δi
This implies a unique maximum at δi = δ 0 , and hence we have incentive compatibility in
dominant strategies.
To see that this solution is the unique set of weights that induces incentive compatibility
in dominant strategies, notice from (48) that the choice of welfare weights (13) is the
only one that will make each individual’s realized welfare independent of everyone else’s
announced discount rate. For any other choice agent i’s realized welfare depends not only
on his announced discount rate δi and his true discount rate δ 0 , but also on the discount
rate announcements of other agents. This means that dominant strategy implementation
of an efficient allocation cannot be possible.

C

Proof of Proposition 3

1) Let the aggregate consumption policy function be Ct = σ(St ) = ASt . Suppose that
planners from t ∈ [τ + , ∞) follow strategy σ(S). The planner at τ ’s welfare from this is
just
Z ∞
V (Cτ , , A) =
Ũ (ASt )β(t)dt
(52)
τ +

34

where St is the solution of the differential equation
Ṡ = rS − AS; S(τ + ) = S

(53)

⇒ St = S e(r−A)t ,

(54)

and S is the stock the current planner bequeaths to his future self at t = τ + . Using the
state equation, and assuming that  is small, we find
S ≈ Sτ (1 + (r − Cτ /Sτ )).

(55)

A straightforward calculation then shows that

(59)

where the approximation becomes exact as  → 0. We wish to solve for the optimal Cτ in
the limit as  → 0. We can expand V (Cτ , , A) in powers of  as follows:
V (Cτ , , A) = V0 + 

∂V
∂

+ O(2 )
=0

Since the contribution of Cτ to welfare in the current period is first order in , we care
only about the part of V (Cτ , , A) which is also first order in , and which depends on Cτ .
Computing the derivative, evaluating at  = 0, and keeping only the terms that depend on
Cτ , we find that

D

Proof of Lemma 1

Let the optimal aggregate consumption path for an individual with discount rate δ be
C(δ) = (cδt )t≥0 , and let her (fixed) income share be s. Denote the preferences over aggregate
consumption paths of an agent with discount rate δ by ≺δ .
We first prove that under the conditions of the lemma, given any pair of discount rates
0
δ < δ 00 , for any δ < δ 0 we must have C(δ 00 ) ≺δ C(δ 0 ), and for any δ > δ 00 , we must have
C(δ 0 ) ≺δ C(δ 00 ). Consider the case δ > δ 00 , and let δ = δ 00 + , where  > 0. We will evaluate
the difference in welfare of agent δ under the two consumption paths C(δ 0 ) and C(δ 00 ). Let

≥ 0.
The last inequality follows from the optimality of C(δ 00 ). Thus we have shown that for
any δ > δ 00 , C(δ 0 ) ≺δ C(δ 00 ). A similar argument shows that for any δ < δ 0 , we must have
C(δ 00 ) ≺δ C(δ 0 ).
It is straightforward to see that with these properties in hand, agents’ preferences over
consumption paths must be single peaked. Consider two paths C(δ 0 ) and C(δ 00 ), and an
agent with discount rate δ, where δ < δ 0 < δ 00 . From the above properties, we must have
C(δ 00 ) ≺δ C(δ 0 ). Similarly, for any paths C(δ 0 ) and C(δ 00 ) with δ 00 < δ 0 < δ, we must have
C(δ 00 ) ≺δ C(δ 0 ). Thus all agents’ preferences are single peaked.

(67)

Thus this factor attains its maximum value at αi = αm . The second factor in (66) is
common for all i, so if we can show that Ri < 1 when i = m, we will be done. Note that,
since η > 1, all welfare integrals are negative, which means that Ri < 1 implies agent i
prefers Economics to Politics.

The sign of the derivative is positive for αj > αm , and negative for αj < αm . Thus the left

is thus satisfied for all j, and strictly satisfied for any j 6= m. This establishes the result.
38

The case η < 1 follows analogously, however in this case we need to worry about the
convergence of welfare integrals. We require δi + (η − 1)r > 0 for all i in order to be able
to compare all agents’ welfare under the two mechanisms. If this condition is satisfied,
the proof goes through with only minor modifications, noting that now the Economics
mechanism is preferred if Ri > 1. If there are some agents with δi + (η − 1)r < 0 their
welfare is undefined under both mechanisms, so we cannot determine their preferences. To
avoid these complications we focus on η ≥ 1.

(76)

Now since αi , αm > 0 when η > 1, this means that

(77)

Thus, when η > 1, Ri has a global maximum at αi = αm (i.e. δi = δm ), at which it takes
the value 1. This implies Ri ≤ 1 for all i. Since welfare values are negative for η > 1,
39

if Ri ≤ 1 for all i, the Economics mechanism is preferred by everyone expect the median
agent, who is indifferent. The case η < 1 follows analogously, with the same caveats as
required in Appendix E.

P
NC
Wi ≥ Wi
⇐⇒ δi ln
≤ hδi i − δm .
(80)
δm
To analyze this condition it is useful to work with the dimensionless variable zi = δi /δm .
The condition (80) then reduces to
ln zi ≤

hzi i − 1
zi

(81)

In what follows we make use of the identities:
ln z ≥ 1 − z −1

(82)

ln z ≤ z − 1.

(83)

Using the identity (82) in (81), in order for agent i to prefer Economics to Politics, it
is sufficient for
1 − zi−1 ≥

hzi i
− zi−1
zi

⇐⇒ zi ≥ hzi i.

40

(84)
(85)

If hzi i < 1, this means that at least a majority of agents will prefer Economics to Politics
(since zi = 1 is the median agent).
Next, using identity (83) in (81) implies that in order for agent i to prefer Politics to
Economics, it is sufficient for
zi − 1 ≤

hzi i − 1
zi

(86)

⇐⇒ zi2 − z + (1 − hzi i) ≤ 0.

(87)

Assume that hzi i > 1. Since zi ≥ 0, this inequality is solved for any zi ∈ [0, z+ ], where
z+ =

1+

p
1 + 4(hzi i − 1)
>1
2

(88)

Thus at least a majority will prefer Politics to Economics when hzi i > 1.
Finally, substituting hzi i = 1 into (81) shows that the population is evenly split between
the two mechanisms in this case.
2) When does Politics lead to higher group welfare than Economics? Calculating the

Politics thus leads to higher group welfare if and only if:
hln zi i < (hzi i − 1)hzi−1 i.

(92)

3) Consider the effect of a mean-preserving spread in zi on the terms in (28). Since ln z
is concave in z, the term on the left hand side decreases under a mean-preserving spread.
The first factor on the right hand side of (28) is constant by assumption, and the term
hzi−1 i increases, since z −1 is convex in z. Thus we find that a mean-preserving spread in zi
41

must necessarily decrease the welfare difference V N C − V P . Increasing the spread in the
distribution of zi thus increases the appeal of the Politics approach.
