    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper describes the Destination-Based Cash-Flow Tax (DBCFT), as proposed in 2016 by Republicans in the US House of Representatives, and its potential economic effects. As a new approach and a major departure from the existing business tax system, the DBCFT and its motivation have been poorly understood by many in government, the business community, and the economics profession.\n\n",
