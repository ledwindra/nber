    "abstract": "\n\nWe present a model of endogenous schooling and earnings to isolate the causal effect of parents\u2019 education on children\u2019s education and earnings outcomes. The model suggests that parents\u2019 education is positively related to children\u2019s earnings, but its relationship with children\u2019s education is ambiguous. Identification is achieved by comparing the earnings of children with the same length of schooling, whose parents have different lengths of schooling. The model also features heterogeneous preferences for schooling, and is estimated using HRS data. The empirically observed positive OLS coefficient obtained by regressing children\u2019s schooling on parents\u2019 schooling is mainly accounted for by the correlation between parents\u2019 schooling and children\u2019s unobserved preferences for schooling. This is countered by a negative, structural relationship between parents\u2019 and children\u2019s schooling choices, resulting in an IV coefficient close to zero when exogenously increasing parents\u2019 schooling. Nonetheless, an exogenous one-year increase in parents\u2019 schooling increases children\u2019s lifetime earnings by 1.2 percent on average.\n\n",
