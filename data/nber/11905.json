    "abstract": "\n\nWhen local cost discovery generates knowledge spillovers, specialization patterns become partly indeterminate and the mix of goods that a country produces may have important implications for economic growth. We demonstrate this proposition formally and adduce some empirical support for it. We construct an index of the \"income level of a country's exports,\" document its properties, and show that it predicts subsequent economic growth.\n\n",
