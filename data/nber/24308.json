    "abstract": "\n\nUsing police accident reports for Tippecanoe County, Indiana, and exploiting the introduction of the augmented reality game Pok\u00e9mon GO as a natural experiment, we document a disproportionate increase in crashes and associated vehicular damage, injuries, and fatalities in the vicinity of locations where users can play the game while driving.  We estimate the incremental county-wide cost of users playing Pok\u00e9mon GO while driving to be in the range of $5.2 to $25.5 million over the 148 days following the introduction of the game.  Extrapolating these estimates to nation-wide levels yields a total ranging from $2.0 to $7.3 billion.\n\n",
