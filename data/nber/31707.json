    "abstract": "\n\nPsychologists have developed effective survey methods of measuring how happy people feel at a given time. The relationship between how happy a person feels and utility is an unresolved question. Existing work in Economics either ignores happiness data or assumes that felt happiness is more or less the same thing as flow utility. The approach we propose in this paper steers a middle course between the two polar views that \u201chappiness is irrelevant to Economics\u201d and the view that \u201chappiness is a sufficient statistic for utility.\u201d\nWe argue that felt happiness is not the same thing as flow utility, but that it does have a systematic relationship to utility. In particular, we propose that happiness is the sum of two components: (1) elation\u2013or short-run happiness\u2013which depends on recent news about lifetime utility and (2) baseline mood\u2013or long-run happiness\u2013which is a subutility function much like health, entertainment, or nutrition. In principle, all of the usual techniques of price theory apply to baseline mood, but the application of those techniques is complicated by the fact that many people may not know the true household production function for baseline mood.\nIf this theory is on target, there are two reasons data on felt happiness is important for Economics. First, short-run happiness in response to news can give important information about preferences. Second, long-run happiness is important for economic welfare in the same way as other higher-order goods such as health, entertainment, or nutrition.\n\n",

Our discussions with him from the very first beginnings of this paper clarified many things for us, particularly about the empirical evidence on happiness measures. However, we need to make clear that there are important aspects of our theoretical position he would not agree with. In addition to Norbert Schwarz, we would like to thank George Akerlof, Toni Antonucci, Robert Barsky, Kerwin Charles, Fred Conrad, Mick Couper, Michael Elsby, Gwenith Fisher, Bruno Frey, Christopher House, Michael Hurd, Helen Levy, Charles Manski, Randolph Nesse, Fumio Ohtake, Antonio Rangel, Luis Rayo, Matthew Shapiro, Daniel Silverman, Alois Stutzer, Yoshiro Tsutsui, Janet Yellen and participants in seminars at Osaka University, the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics, University of Michigan, Harvard, and Brown for helpful discussions and comments on early versions of this material. They must also be absolved from complicity in any errors we perpetrate, small or large. We are grateful for support from National Institute on Aging grant P01 AG026571-01.
