    "abstract": "\n\nDisagreements about normative aspects of social time preferences have led to estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) that differ by orders of magnitude.  We investigate how disagreements about the SCC change if planners are non-dogmatic, i.e., they admit the possibility of a change in their normative views, and internalise the preferences of future selves.  Although non-dogmatic planners may disagree about all the contentious aspects of social time preferences, disagreements about the SCC reduce dramatically.  Admitting the possibility of a change in views once every 40 years results in a 4.6-fold reduction in the range of recommended SCCs.\n\n",
