This emerges\nfrom a model in which the firms are assumed to sustain collusion by the threat\nof reversion to more competitive pricing. We consider both prices and\nquantities as the strategic variables and study competition both in the\ndomestic and the foreign market taken individually, and in the two markets\ntaken together.\n\n",
