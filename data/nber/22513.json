    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper we document significantly steeper declines in nondurable expenditures in the UK compared to the US, in spite of income paths being similar. We explore several possible causes, including different employment paths, housing ownership and expenses, levels and paths of health status, number of household members, and out-of -pocket medical expenditures. Among all the potential explanations considered, we find that those to do with healthcare\u2014differences in levels and age paths in medical expenses\u2014can fully account for the steeper declines in nondurable consumption in the UK compared to the US.\n\n",
