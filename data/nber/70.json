    "abstract": "\n\nA variety of qualitative dependent variable models are surveyed with attention focused on the computational aspects of their analysis. The models covered include single equation dichotomous models; single equation polychotomous models with unordered, ordered, and sequential variables; and simultaneous equation models. Care is taken to illucidate the nature of the suggested \"full information\" and \"limited information\" approaches to the simultaneous equation models and the formulation of recursive and causal chain models.\n\n",
