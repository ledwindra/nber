    "abstract": "\n\nRegressions of ex post changes in floating exchange rates on appropriate interest differentials typically imply that the high- interest rate currency tends to appreciate, the `forward discount puzzle.'  Using data from the European Monetary System, we find that a large part of the forward discount puzzle vanishes for regimes of fixed exchange rates.  That is, deviations from uncovered interest parity appear to vary in a way which is dependent upon the exchange rate regime.  By using the many EMS realignments, we are also able to quantify the `peso problem.'\n\n",
