    "abstract": "\n\nFirms often restrict workers\u2019 mobility with Noncompete Agreements (NCAs). Using state-level law changes, we find that making NCAs easier to enforce (\u201cstricter\u201d enforceability) leads to fewer patents, an effect that we show reflects a loss in innovation. While stricter enforceability encourages firms\u2019 R&D investment, consistent with alleviating hold-up concerns, it also limits inventors\u2019 job mobility and new business formation; supplementary evidence indicates the decline in mobility stifles knowledge diffusion. Analyses of technology-specific nationwide exposure, as well as cross-state spillovers via firms\u2019 corporate networks, reveal that our state-level estimates, if anything, understate the economy-wide effects of NCA enforceability on innovation.\n\n",
