    "abstract": "\n\nCurrency denomination is a prominent feature in the analysis of the structure of international bond markets, but is largely absent from analyses of cross-border investment in debt securities. This omission owes in part to the limitations of widely used datasets such as the IMF\u2019s CPIS data (on positions) and its BOP data (on flows): Neither identifies the currency denomination of the underlying bonds and both combine bonds of various currencies in a single data point. In this paper we show that bonds denominated in the investor\u2019s currency are special. We show this indirectly in a global dataset of bilateral bond holdings\u2014indirectly because the global holdings dataset does not differentiate by currency denomination\u2014and then more directly in datasets of US holdings of foreign bonds that do differentiate by currency. We find that the share of a country\u2019s bonds denominated in investors\u2019 currencies is an important determinant of the amount of cross-border investment it receives; factors associated with greater (or less) cross-border investment in bonds differ by currency denomination; and one phenomenon of international portfolios\u2014the ever-present home bias\u2014in some cases actually disappears when bonds are denominated in the investor\u2019s currency, suggesting that the home bias is to some extent a home currency bias.\n\n",
