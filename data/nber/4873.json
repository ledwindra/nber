    "abstract": "\n\nWe construct a simple model in which high inflation imposes welfare costs because it affects the ability of the financial sector to screen between high and low cost producers.  Consumers search for a low price and inflation reduces the incentives to search, resulting in an increase in the demand of high cost producers.  We show that beyond a certain level of inflation there is a switch from a separating equilibrium to a pooling equilibrium, where financial institutions become unable to distinguish among clients.  In this pooling equilibrium a larger share of credit is allocated to less efficient firms.\n\n",
