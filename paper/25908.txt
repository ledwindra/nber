ABSTRACT
In lower-income economies, stocks exhibit less idiosyncratic volatility and business groups are
more prevalent. This study connects these two findings by showing that business group affiliated
firms’ stock returns exhibit less idiosyncratic volatility than do the returns of otherwise similar
unaffiliated firms. Global commodity price shocks are common shocks that contribute to firmlevel idiosyncratic risk because they affect industries heterogeneously. Idiosyncratic components
of commodity shocks are incorporated less into idiosyncratic returns of group affiliates than
unaffiliated firms in the same industry and economy. Identification follows from difference-indifference tests exploiting successful and matched-exogenously-failed control block transactions.

Introduction
Stocks move more synchronously (Morck et al., 2000) in less developed economies and

in economies that allocate capital less efficiently across industries (Wurgler, 2000). Business
groups are also more important in less developed economies (La Porta et al., 1999; Fogel 2006;
Masulis et al. 2011) and are associated with compromised economy-level capital allocation
efficiency (Almeida and Wolfenzon 2006b; Morck, Yavuz and Yeung 2011). This study
connects these two lines of research by showing that business group affiliated firms’ stocks move
less idiosyncratically than the stocks of otherwise similar unaffiliated firms in the same
industries subjected to the same commodity price shocks.
Idiosyncratic shocks are more important in some firms and economies than in others due
more active risk taking, entrepreneurship and creative destruction (Chun et al.,2011; Bartram,
Brown and Stulz, 2012) or a more competitive environment (Irvine and Pontiff, 2009).
Differences in the importance of observed idiosyncratic shocks may also reflect differences in
transparency and insiders’ private-benefits (Jin and Myers, 2006), the marginal costs and benefits
of producing firm-specific information (Veldkamp, 2006) and media coverage (Kim, Yu and
Zhang, 2016). Numerous studies, surveyed in Morck et al. (2013), support all of these
explanations with the common theme being higher firm-specific return volatility reflecting better
functioning financial systems in more developed economies. Panel A of Figure 1 summarizes
this stylized fact.
At the same time, the prevalence of business groups, defined here as collections of firms
under common control through equity blocks, correlates negatively with economic development.
This pattern, evident in the data, is plotted in Panel B of Figure 1. Business groups can shift
income from firms with excess free cash flow to firms with unfinanced profitable investments

1

(Almeida and Wolfenzon, 2006a). Business groups may also shift income to fund private
benefits for their top insiders (Johnson et al., 1999; Bertrand, Mehta and Mullainathan, 2002),
and Jin and Myers (2006) argue that shifting firm-specific income to corporate insiders is less
observable to public shareholders. Business groups may also prop up ill-run affiliates (Morck
and Nakamura, 1999) and share risks (Hoshi, Kashyap and Scharfstein, 1990, 1991; Friedman,
Johnson and Mitton, 2003; Khanna and Yafeh, 2005; Gopalan, Nanda, and Seru, 2007).
Investors, expecting business groups to behave in any or all of these ways, may rationally expect
idiosyncratic shocks to have less impact on the share prices of a group affiliate than on the share
prices of an otherwise comparable unaffiliated firm.
To understand whether group affiliated firms and unaffiliated firms incorporate firmspecific shocks differently and avoid explanations contaminated by differences in shocks and/or
their observability, one would ideally like to observe the responses of group affiliated and
unaffiliated firms to the same shock, which would be observable by all market participants. This
is precisely what we do in this paper. We test whether or not global commodity price shocks,
observable simultaneously to all investors throughout the world, have different impacts on the
share prices of group-affiliated and unaffiliated firms in commodity-sensitive sectors.
This requires matching commodities to industries - - and thus to firms. We do this in
three main ways. One approach uses statistically estimated out-of-sample sensitivity of U.S.
industries to commodity shocks, emulating Rajan and Zingales’ (1998) methodology for flagging
external finance-dependent sectors. The major advantage of the statistical method is that it
gauges an industry’s sensitivity to commodity price-related shocks through all possible channels,
including supply and demand effects, linkages to untraded commodities or other factors
(Anderson and Danthine, 1981). The second approach uses constrained statistical matches, those

2

that best satisfy the criteria of the statistical method subject to the industry being a direct users or
producers of the commodity linked to it.

The third approach simply links industries to

commodities that constitute large fractions of their inputs or outputs by using Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA) input-output tables.

Because business groups are relatively

unimportant in the US (La Porta et al., 1999; Masulis et al. 2011), the statistical method and
constrained statistical method mitigate attenuation bias due to group affiliated firms possibly
being less responsive to commodity shocks. The third method sidelines this problem by focusing
on commodity inputs and outputs rather than estimating sensitivities in sample.
We find that the idiosyncratic returns of business group affiliated firms are less
responsive to idiosyncratic commodity price shocks than are the idiosyncratic returns of
unaffiliated firms after controlling for time-varying country-industry level latent variables. The
results are not driven by firm-level observable characteristics such as hedging, diversification
across industries, its equity ownership of other firms, leverage, size or R&D activity. The results
are robust to battery of tests that vary industry-commodity matching, business group affiliate
identification, regression specifications, samples and the asset pricing model used in calculation
of idiosyncratic returns.
Further identification follows from difference-in-difference tests exploiting changes in
group affiliation, control block acquisitions and failed control block bids. The stocks of
previously unaffiliated firms that become group affiliated immediately become less sensitive to
such commodity price shocks compared to a matched group of firms not changing group
affiliation and the stocks of previously affiliated firms that cease to be group affiliated
immediately become more sensitive to such commodity price shocks compared to a matched
group of firms not changing group affiliation. Potential selection problems in control block

3

transactions are precluded by comparing successful acquisition attempts with matched control
block bids that failed for defensibly exogenous reasons (Seru, 2014), which reaffirms our results.
We also show that the stocks of group firms’ in other sectors, including sectors that are
not sensitive to commodity shocks, react to idiosyncratic commodity shocks affecting industries
in which other firms in the same business group operate. These results are consistent with
investors expecting risk sharing or income shifting within business group firms to attenuate firmspecific stock return volatility associated with idiosyncratic commodity shocks.
If group affiliation attenuates share price responses to commodity shocks, it may well
attenuate share price responses to other firm-specific shocks and increase stock price
synchronicity across all the firms in the business group. Indeed, Khanna and Thomas (2009)
report significantly elevated synchronicity in the stock returns of Chilean firms with director
interlocks and equity ties. Attenuated firm-specific shocks would increase a stock’s
synchronicity with its market measured by its market model R2. Firm-level tests show that
business group affiliates’ stocks have higher synchronicity with their markets than do otherwise
similar unaffiliated firms. Finally, Panel C of Figure 1 shows that stock returns are more
synchronous in economies where more firms are group affiliated. Thus, we show business group
prevalence to be a complementary explanation, in addition to others surveyed by Morck et al.
(2013), to market level stock synchronicity.
Finally, our results expose basic issues regarding the fundamental role of the stock
market in capitalizing firm-specific information into stock prices (Grossman 1976) and
allocating resources to their highest value uses (Tobin 1984). Group firms’ stocks moving less
than otherwise similar unaffiliated firms’ stocks on the same commodity price shock can be
viewed as the market efficiently reflecting information about real differences in how that shock

4

is expected to affect the two firms. Thus our paper highlights how expected intragroup resource
and risk reallocation reduce group firms' idiosyncratic stock return volatility from commodity
shocks and presumably from non-systematic shocks in general. This leaves each individual
group firm's stock price less able to provide feedback to inform its capital providers and
managers (Bond et al. 2012).

2.

Data and Methodology

There are several steps in the construction of our sample: First, we identify group affiliated firms
as outlined below. Next, we calculate idiosyncratic components of stock returns and
idiosyncratic components of commodity shocks. Finally, we identify which industries (and hence
firms) would be sensitive to shocks to the prices of key commodities using three different
methods of matching.
2.1

Group Affiliation

Ownership data for publicly traded firms worldwide are from three sources: Worldscope for
1993 through 2009; Thomson Reuters Ownership for 2005 through 2012; and Datastream Asset
4 Universe for 2002 through 2013.1 For an economy to be included in our sample, we require
that it have at least 50 publicly traded firms for which we have ownership data at any time during
the entire sample period. This leaves a sample of 43 economies.
Each of these data sources provides the name and the cash flow (i.e., ownership) rights of
each firm’s largest shareholder. We presume that the largest blockholder has a controlling stake
if her ownership stake in the firm is at least 20%. This cut-off is also employed by La Porta et al.

1

All three datasets have been discontinued.

5

(1999) to infer control.2 Using this relatively high ownership threshold minimizes problems due
to cross-economy differences in the precise threshold that triggers ownership disclosure. Our
data provide ownership stakes, not voting control stakes, which depend on control enhancement
devices such as dual class shares, golden shares, reserved board seats, or pyramiding via unlisted
affiliates. This almost certainly leads to misclassifying some group affiliates as unaffiliated, and
therefore introduces an attenuation bias, biasing point coefficient estimates on measures of group
affiliation towards zero.
Controlling shareholders are classified as governments, corporations, investment funds or
individuals (including families) using lists of words and abbreviations commonly found in the
names of each sort of entities. Faccio, Marchica, and Mura (2011) provide a list of terms
commonly found in the names of government shareholders (in various languages) and Faccio
and O’Brien (2015) provide an analogous list for corporate entities. For example, a controlling
shareholder whose name contains the term “Ltd”, or its equivalent in another language, is
presumed a corporation; while a controlling shareholder whose name contains the term
“municipal” is presumed a government entity. Investment funds are flagged using an analogous
list we develop for this purpose. Terms such as “fund” identify investment funds.3 Any

2
3

Robustness tests in Section 5.2 alternatively use a 15% ownership threshold.
In some countries, business families control business groups via pension funds – e.g. Brazil (Perkins et al., 2014),
closed-end mutual funds – e.g. Sweden (Högfeldt, 2005), or other institutional investment funds. In recent years,
increasing numbers of US firms have investment funds as common equity block holders (Gilje, Gormley and
Levit, 2018). The Investment Companies Act of 1940 proscribes US investment companies from intervening in
listed firms’ management decisions except as shareholders operating via channels legally open to shareholders, so
the effects we explore are less likely to be evident in such cases. Disputed findings (e.g., Rock et al., 2017;
Schmalz, 2018) nonetheless associate common institutional investor ownership with coordinated corporate
strategies, notably price fixing. To avoid counting US ETFs or investment funds as controlling shareholders in
defining business groups, common blockholders are screened for English terms associated with institutional
investors (listed in Appendix A3). This presumes English terms flag US-based institutional investors and miss
those based in other countries. Robustness tests (not shown) that retain investment companies associated with a
business family (using a list of keywords like “family”, “estate” etc.) as common controlling shareholders for the
purpose of detecting business groups yields results (not shown) similar to those in the tables. The list of words
used to identify investment funds is available on request.

6

controlling shareholder not classified as a government, corporation or as investment fund is
presumed an individual.
Firms whose controlling shareholder is a government entity are dropped from the sample
because state owned enterprises’ (SOEs) soft budget constraints (Kornai, 1986) could affect the
link between their fundamentals and stock returns. SOEs’ public shareholders might anticipate
bailouts to smooth earnings fluctuations; and natural monopoly SOEs might pass shocks to
consumers, partially immunizing shareholders. SOE shares’ reactions may thus resemble those
of group affiliates even if the SOEs are not formal affiliates of state-controlled groups of listed
firms, such as existed in Austria and Italy until recently and remain important in China.
We classify a firm as group affiliated if (1) its controlling shareholder is a corporation;
(2) its controlling shareholder is an individual who controls at least one other firm in our sample;
or (3) the firm itself is the controlling shareholder of at least one other firm in our sample. All
other firms, including those controlled by investment funds, are designated unaffiliated. This
classification algorithm follows prior studies (e.g. Faccio, Lang and Young, 2001; Bae, Kang,
and Kim, 2002; Bertrand, Mehta, and Mullainathan, 2002; Baek, Kang, and Lee, 2006; Masulis,
Pham and Zein, 2011) in defining business groups as collections of separate legal entities under
common control through equity blocks.
To identify controlling shareholders who own control blocks in multiple firms in the
sample, the names of controlling shareholders are matched by Levenshtein (1965) distance: the
minimum number of single character edits (excluding punctuation, multiple consecutive spaces,
and spaces at the beginning or at the end) required to change one name into the other, normalized
by the length of the shorter name. If the Levenshtein distance between two names is 20% or less,
the algorithm infers a match. The algorithm allows for minor name variations that exact

7

matching would miss, but is far from perfect.
False and missed matches are inevitable. The vagaries of languages and the complexities
of control chains (see Almeida et al., 2011) combined with a relatively stringent (20%) threshold
likely leave missed matches predominating. Our approach misses group affiliates controlled via
multiple control chain that sum to over 20% if each falls below that threshold as well as those
controlled via the control enhancement devices mentioned above. This further potential
misclassification of group affiliates as unaffiliated also adds attenuation bias in the tests below.
An opposite problem arises if we misidentify targets in the process of being acquired or divisions
in the process of being divested as group affiliates. This is a potentially more serious problem in
economies, such as the US, with more merger and divestiture activity.4
This yields 55,671 unique firms and 390,186 firm-years of ownership data. Table 1 Panel
A summarizes firm-year observations classified as group affiliated versus unaffiliated, by
economy. Consistent with prior studies, business groups are prevalent around the world, and
more prevalent in some economies than others. For example, group affiliated firms account for
large fraction of firms in Chile, Italy, Hong Kong and Peru, but lower fractions of firms in
Taiwan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Stulz (2005) shows how the
percentage of shares held by control block holders varies across economies. Although presence
of a control blockholder does not imply business group affiliation, Stulz’s (2005) ranking of
economies by percentage of shares held by blockholders is consistent with our ranking by the
prevalence of business groups: Taiwan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada rank
low, while Peru and Chile rank high.
4

Many instances of listed US firms holding equity blocks exceeding 20% in other listed firms may be corporate
control transactions in progress. Acquirers often begin with toehold acquisitions followed by bids for all the
target’s shares (Betton et al., 2009). Lasting toeholds exist, for example between firms undertaking a joint venture,
but the stakes are typically far smaller than 20% and do not indicate common control (Ouimet, 2013).

2.2

Firm-level control variables

Table 1 Panel B summarizes the means of key firm-level characteristics across group affiliated
and unaffiliated firms. The panel reports statistics both from the entire sample and from the
sample excluding US firms. We report both because in some tests we exclude US firms as
explained below. The firm diversification variable is minus one times the Herfindahl index of the
firm’s industrial focus, measured using Datastream annual segment-level revenues in up to ten
product segments, so a value of minus one indicates an undiversified firm.5 Leverage is book
value of total debt divided by book value of total assets. Hedging activity is an indicator variable
equal to 1 if Datastream reports that the firm discloses financial data associated with hedging or
derivative usage: these are “Comprehensive Income Hedging Gain/Loss”, “Unrealized Valuation
Gains/Losses Hedges/Derivatives”, “Derivative Assets Current”, “Derivative Liabilities
Current”, “Derivative Assets Non-Current”, “Derivative Liabilities Non-Current”. The proxies
for firm size, market capitalization in million USD or total assets in thousand USD, enter the
regressions as logs. R&D activity is R&D expenses over total assets. If R&D expenses are
missing, R&D spending is presumed insubstantial and set to zero.
Compared to unaffiliated firms, group affiliated firms are on average smaller, more
leveraged, less invested in R&D, more diversified, and less actively hedging. The tests below
must thus allow for these differences between group affiliated and unaffiliated firms in
contrasting their responses to idiosyncratic shocks.

Firm-specific Shocks

If segment-level sales are unreported we assume the firm’s sales are in one segment.

9

For each firm, Datastream weekly (Wednesday-to-Wednesday) total returns are used. These
include price changes and dividends and are adjusted for stock splits, reverse splits, and stock
dividends. Stocks that trade for fewer than 12 weeks during our sample period are dropped, as
are firm-week observations with three or more missing daily returns in the week. Following the
prior literature, in particular Jin and Myers (2005), we use a version of global CAPM to define
firm specific shocks. Since we investigate the link between two lines of prior research, for the
sake of transparency, we believe it useful to avoid changing the methodology. However, in
robustness tests, we consider an alternative asset pricing model based on Fama and French’s
(2015) global 5-factor model.
Firm-specific shocks are the residuals from separate regressions for each firm in the
sample period:
2

𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + ∑ (𝛽1,𝑖,𝑡+𝑙 𝑟𝑚,𝑡+𝑙 + 𝛽2,𝑖,𝑡+𝑙 (𝑟𝑈𝑆,𝑡+𝑙 + 𝑒𝑈𝑆,𝑚,𝑡+𝑙 )) +𝜀𝑖,𝑡

[1]

𝑙=−2

The explained variable, 𝑟𝑖,𝑡 , is the total return of firm i’s stock in week t in the local
currency. The explanatory variables are 𝑟𝑚,𝑡+𝑙 , the stock market return of economy m where i’s
stock trades, in local currency, 𝑟𝑈𝑆,𝑡+𝑙 , the US stock market return (in US dollars), and
𝑒𝑈𝑆,𝑚(𝑖),𝑡+𝑙 , is the return from buying US dollar at the beginning of the week and selling at the
end of the week in 𝑚’s domestic currency. Including leads and lags, l, of -2,-1, 0, 1 and 2 weeks
for the explanatory variables accounts for differences in time zones, illiquidity, and
nonsynchronous trading. The residual, 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 , is the firm-specific shock of stock i in week t. We
focus on how shocks to idiosyncratic component of stock returns, the 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 , react to idiosyncratic
shocks to commodity prices.

10

2.4

Idiosyncratic Commodity Shocks

We construct economy-specific idiosyncratic commodity price shocks by considering how
different commodities’ prices can affect different economies’ fundamentals differently. For
example, an oil price increase might have a more widespread impact across all sectors in a
heavily oil export dependent economy, such as Norway, than a more diversified economy such
as Germany.
Datastream provides daily price indexes for major commodities, whose prices are
globally determined, starting in 1993.6 Table 2 lists these and their Datastream identifiers.
Following Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2004), commodity returns are changes in spot prices.
Economy-level commodity shocks are the residuals from separate regressions of the form [2] for
each commodity economy pair:
2

𝑟𝑐,𝑚,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑐 + ∑

(𝛽1,𝑐,𝑡+𝑙 𝑟𝑚,𝑡+𝑙 + 𝛽2,𝑐,𝑡+𝑙 (𝑟𝑈𝑆,𝑡+𝑙 + 𝑒𝑈𝑆,𝑚,𝑡+𝑙 )) +𝜀𝑐,𝑚,𝑡 .

[2]

𝑙=−2

The explained variable 𝑟𝑐,𝑚,𝑡 is commodity c’s weekly (Wednesday to Wednesday) return in
economy 𝑚’s local currency at time t. The explanatory variables are as in [1]. The idiosyncratic
shock to commodity c’s price change in economy m in week t is the residual, 𝜀𝑐,𝑚,𝑡 .

2.5

Identifying Industry-Commodity Matches

The tests below require identifying industries that are sensitive to shocks to the price of each
commodity. In-sample estimation of these sensitivities is problematic because our hypothesis is
that group affiliation may dampen the observable effects of commodity shocks on share prices.

6

Commodities, such as natural gas, whose pricing is subject to segmented markets problems, are excluded from the
sample.

11

Three alternative methods of matching industries to commodities are employed to circumvent
this problem.

2.5.1

Statistical Method

This method reapplies the methodology of Rajan and Zingales (1998), who use US data to
estimate external finance-dependence across industries in that economy and infer that the same
industries are apt to require external financing elsewhere. We likewise use US data, which is left
out-of-sample in tests using this methodology, to estimate commodity price-dependence across
industries in the US and infer that the same industries are commodity price-sensitive in other
economies too.
Following Rajan and Zingales (1998) in using US data to identify industry-commodity
has several advantages. First, because business groups are relatively rare in the US (La Porta et
al., 1999; Villalonga and Amit, 2009; Masulis et al., 2011), group affiliation is relatively less
likely to damp the observable effects of commodity shocks on share prices there. US industries’
commodity price sensitivities are thus a useful out-of-sample benchmark, against which to gauge
how business group affiliation might dampen commodity price-sensitivity in economies where
business groups are important. Second, US stock prices appear to incorporate more firm-specific
information (broadly defined) than do stocks in most other economies (Bartram, Brown and
Stulz, 2012). Finally, because the US has, on average, more listed firms per industry, US data
provide more precise point estimates in the exercise below.
Firm-level US data are from Compustat and CRSP. Using FF-30 industries ensures a
large number of firms in each industry to estimate industry sensitivity to commodities. Firms that
hedge commodity risk may exhibit a lower sensitivity to commodity shocks; however, smaller

12

US firms are less likely to hedge (Nance, Smith, and Smithson, 1993; Geczy, Minton, and
Schrand, 1997; Carter, Rogers, and Simkins, 2006; Rampini, Sufi, and Viswanathan, 2014). We
therefore use the smallest quartile (by market capitalization) of US firms in each industry at the
beginning of each month to match industries to commodities.
Each US industry is matched to one commodity by assessing how sensitive firm-specific
return shocks in an industry are to idiosyncratic shocks in the prices of different commodities.
This is accomplished by estimating the following three sets of regressions:

2

∀ firms 𝑖,

𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + ∑

( 𝛽𝑖,𝑡+𝑙 𝑟𝑈𝑆,𝑡+𝑙 ) +𝜀𝑖,𝑡 ,

[3a]

( 𝛽𝑐,𝑡+𝑙 𝑟𝑈𝑆,𝑡+𝑙 ) +𝜀𝑐,𝑈𝑆,𝑡 ,

[3b]

𝑙=−2

2

∀ commodities 𝑐,

𝑟𝑐,𝑈𝑆,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑐 + ∑

𝑙=−2

19

∀ industries 𝑗,

𝜀𝑖(𝑗),𝑡 = 𝛼𝑗 + ∑

( 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 𝜀𝑐,𝑈𝑆,𝑡 ) + 𝜏𝑖,𝑡 .

[3c]

𝑐=1

Regressions [3a] and [3b] adapt [1] and [2] to US firms. Regression [3c], which runs
pooled regressions for each industry j, explains residuals 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 from [3a] with contemporaneous
residuals 𝜀𝑐(𝑈𝑆),𝑡 from [3b]. That is, [3c] explains variation in the firm-specific shocks in week 𝑡
stock return of small US firms i in industry j with variation in the US economy-specific
idiosyncratic components of the return to holding commodity c that week. The 𝜏𝑖,𝑡 are regression
residuals in [3c]. A tighter link between commodity c and industry j is inferred from a more
statistically significant loading 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 in the regression [3c] for that industry.
We require a minimum threshold of three for the absolute value of the t-statistic of the
loading 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 and then select the commodity-industry pair with the highest absolute t-statistic

13

among these as a potential match. We then run a univariate second pass regression analogous to
[3c] – namely, 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 𝜀𝑐(𝑈𝑆),𝑡 + 𝜏𝑖,𝑡 – for the potential match. We declare a match between
industry j and commodity c only if the commodity’s coefficient has the same sign as in the firstpass regression and the t-statistic in this second pass regression also exceeds three in absolute
value. This extra step is done to cull false matches due to multicollinearity (no false matches are
identified).
The major advantage of the statistical method is that it gauges an industry’s sensitivity to
commodity prices through all possible channels. For example, a shock to oil prices might affect
the auto industry by affecting input prices (supply shock) or consumer preferences as to the type
of car (demand shock). The commodity matches identified with this procedure could proxy for
the prices of goods that affect an industry, but for which no global commodity market exists
(Anderson and Danthine, 1981), other fundamental shocks that affect an industry, substitutes for
industry’s main product, or other such factors. In all such cases, the industry-commodity match
is valid for our analysis as long as the shock to the matched commodity is a good proxy for the
unobserved fundamental shock to the matched industry.
The major disadvantages of statistical matching are that type one and type two errors
inevitably arise, missing genuine matches and declaring spurious matches. Spurious or missed
matches are likely to induce attenuation bias in the tests that follow. We therefore test whether
industry commodity matches are valid out-of-sample in section 3 below.
Columns 1-3 in Table 2A list the industry-commodity matches detected using the
“statistical” method. Some matches are intuitive, such as that between the “Precious Metals,
Non-Metallic, and Industrial Metal Mining” industry and “Gold” and that between “Petroleum
and Natural Gas” industry and “Crude Oil”. Others link seemingly unrelated industries and

14

commodities, such as “Fabricated Products and Machinery”, matched to “Feeder Cattle”. Closer
investigation provides economic intuition for some of these. For example, farm equipment is
included in the “Fabricated Products and Machinery” industry. Regardless, validating matches
intuitively is subject to ex-post justification bias. We therefore take the matches as determined by
the data.
We supplement tests using this approach with tests using matches based on a constrained
statistical matching method and on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) input-output (I-O)
tables that list industries direct dependence on commodities. These alternative methods are
discussed below.

2.5.2

Constrained Statistical Method

The method above generates statistically highly significant matches between some industries and
commodities that may not be directly related. If these commodities capture genuine supply and
demand, cross-industry, or latent factor effects, the method is useful. If these matches are false
positives, tests using them suffer from attenuation bias.
The modified statistical method is designed to mitigate any such attenuation bias. This
method uses the same algorithm as the statistical matching method, but adds the requirement that
the commodity and industry be directly related. This retains the matches between “Petroleum and
Natural Gas” and “Crude Oil”, “Precious Metals” and “Gold”, but drops several matches with
“Feeder Cattle” and adds matches at finer (4 digit SIC) industry-levels between industries and
commodities they directly produce or consume. We verify that, in the univariate second pass
regression analogous to [3c], the t-statistic of the loading 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 on commodity shocks exceeds
three in absolute value for the additional industry-commodity matches introduced in this way.

15

This adds matches between “Roasted Coffee” and “Coffee”, “Meat Products” and “Feeder
Cattle”, “Lumber and Wood Products” and “Lumber” etc. Table 2-A Columns 4-6 list industrycommodity matches determined by this method.
The constrained statistical matching method potentially mitigates concerns about noisedriven matches and mismatches; but reduces the sample size by 74% because many fewer firms
end up in industries matched to a commodity. This potentially gives rise to issues related to
power in regressions. Therefore, we view this method as a robustness test.

2.5.3

BEA Method

An alternative and qualitatively different approach uses Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
input-output (I-O) tables. These list every industry’s use of inputs produced by every other
industry for approximately 56,000 industry pairs in the US. This matching method is not
statistical-based, and thus avoids noise-driven matches and mismatches. However, it does not
capture all possible channels through which commodity price shocks might affect an industry.
For example, an increase in oil prices might boost the profits of coal mines, which produce a
substitute for oil but do not use much oil as input.
The BEA matching method proceeds as follows: First, a set of basic commodity-linked
industries is determined by identifying industries that produce each given commodity or use it as
their predominant input. For example, “Cotton Farming” is linked to the commodity “Cotton”,
“Cattle Ranching and Farming” to “Feeder Cattle”, “Petroleum Refineries” to “Crude Oil”, and
so on. We declare these “base” industries matched to that commodity and report them in Table
2B.
We then identify industries that depend on a commodity by summing each industry’s

16

inputs from the base industries that are already linked to the commodity. If at least 10% of an
industry’s inputs are from industries already linked to the commodity, we match that industry to
the same commodity. For example, the base industries matched to “Crude Oil” provide 22% of
the inputs of “Asphalt shingle and coating materials manufacturing”, so we also match that
industry to “Crude Oil.” We repeat this matching process for two additional rounds, increasing
the threshold for declaring a match to 20% in the second and 30% in third round because the
number of industries matched to each commodity increases prior to each round.7 Table 2B lists
the 86 matches of (6 digit I-O classification) industries to commodities.8

The Incorporation of Idiosyncratic Commodity Shocks into Stock Prices

Regression [4] tests whether or not group affiliated firms’ stock returns incorporate idiosyncratic
information differently vis-à-vis unaffiliated firms. Following Jin and Myers (2005) we employ a
variant of Fama-MacBeth estimation, which Petersen (2009) finds appropriate in panel
regressions explaining abnormal returns. The regressions explain weekly shocks to firm-specific
stock returns with idiosyncratic components of weekly shocks to the prices of matched
commodities, calculated separately for each economy thus:
𝑁

𝜀𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑏1 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 𝑠𝑔𝑛(𝛽𝑐,𝑗 ) + 𝑏2 𝐺𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑏3 𝐺𝑖,𝑡 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 𝑠𝑔𝑛(𝛽𝑐,𝑗 ) + ∑ 𝑏𝑣 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑗,𝑚 + 𝑢𝑖,𝑡
𝑣=4

The explained variable 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 is the firm-specific shock to the return of stock i in week t from [1].

7

Alternative thresholds and additional rounds of matching generate similar results (unreported).We stop at the third
round because a fourth adds only 2 additional matches.
8
A concordance table provided by the BEA matches its I-O industry classification system with the NAICS industry
classification and a second concordance table provided by the US Census Department links NAICS industries to
the SIC classification system available in Datastream.

17

[4]

The first explanatory variable, 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 is the idiosyncratic commodity shock 𝜀𝑐,𝑚,𝑡 to country m
from equation [2] that is matched to the firm 𝑖’s industry j. Multiplying the idiosyncratic
component of commodity shock by 𝑠𝑔𝑛(𝛽𝑐,𝑗 ), which is one or minus one as 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 in [3c] is
positive or negative, respectively, sgn ensures that expected sign of 𝑏1 is positive regardless of
whether shocks to the price of commodity 𝑐 affect industry 𝑗 positively or negatively9. If firm i’s
industry, j, is not matched with any commodity c the firm is dropped from the sample. The
second explanatory variable is an indicator variable, denoted 𝐺𝑖,𝑡 , set to one if firm i is a group
affiliate at time t and to zero otherwise.
In some specifications, we include firm-specific control variables, 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 and industryeconomy fixed effects, denoted 𝛿𝑗,𝑚 , based on 30 Fama-French industries. Industry-economy
fixed-effects subsume all latent factors with variation at the industry, economy, or industryeconomy levels. Moreover, the estimates in the tables are the means of week-by-week FamaMacBeth regressions, so the coefficients of the industry-economy fixed effects take different
values each week, effectively leaving the regressions subsuming all time-varying industry,
economy, and industry-economy level latent factors as well. In this context, Fama-MacBeth
estimation also has the advantage of mitigating potential bias due to cross-sectional correlation in
the firm-specific stock returns. The dependent variables are estimated idiosyncratic returns and
so ought not to be autocorrelated, but to err on the size of underestimating significance levels, we
allow for any potential autocorrelation in the firm-specific stock returns by assessing the
significance of the means of the coefficients in [4] using Newey-West t-statistics, adjusted for 4week lags.

9

The sign of 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 is similarly calculated using the regression specification [3c] for the BEA matched industrycommodity pairs.

18

The coefficient 𝑏1 can be estimated if industry-economy fixed-effects are not introduced.
A positive and significant coefficient for 𝑏1 implies that, on average, commodities are correctly
matched to industries. The coefficient of interest in [4] is 𝑏3 , that of the sign-adjusted interaction
of the commodity shock measure 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 with the group affiliation indicator, 𝐺𝑖𝑡 . A negative and
significant 𝑏3 implies that group-affiliated firms exhibit a muted response to economy-specific
commodity shocks as compared to unaffiliated firms.
Table 3 summarizes the main regression results. Regressions 3.1 and 3.2 use the variant
of 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 calculated in [2] and matched to industries using the statistical method. Regressions
3.3 and 3.4 use the variant of 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 matched to industries using the constrained statistical
method and regressions 3.5 and 3.6 use the variant of 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 matched to industries using the
BEA matching method. Regressions 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6 include industry-economy fixed effects.
In regressions 3.1, 3.3 and 3.5, the coefficient 𝑏1 on the commodity shock measure is
positive and statistically significant. This affirms that, on average, the industry-commodity
matching procedure successfully identifies commodity shocks relevant to the firm-specific
shocks to the returns of firms in those industries even out of sample. The coefficient 𝑏1 in 3.1
links a one-percentage point idiosyncratic shock to commodity prices to a five basis point
idiosyncratic shock to the stock prices of unaffiliated firms. The coefficient of the group
affiliation indicator, 𝑏2 , is positive and significant in most regressions, implying that group
affiliated firms have higher average idiosyncratic returns than unaffiliated firms have.
The key coefficient of interest is 𝑏3 , on the interaction of the commodity shock measure
with the group affiliation indicator. This is negative and statistically significant in all
specifications. This indicates a muted incorporation of commodity shocks into the idiosyncratic
stock returns of group affiliated firms on average. Specifically, the interaction coefficient in 3.1
19

links a one-percentage point shock to commodity prices to a three (5.82 – 2.46 = 3.36) basis
point shock to the firm-specific stock returns of group affiliated firms. This is about 40% less
than the shock to unaffiliated firms’ share prices and the difference between the two is highly
statistically significant across all specifications. The regressions in Table 3 demonstrate a
statistically and economically significant damping of the impact of idiosyncratic commodity
price shocks on the idiosyncratic return of group affiliated firms relative to unaffiliated firms.

4.

Identification of Group Affiliation as the Culprit

The results above show group-affiliated firms’ stocks to be less responsive to a given economyspecific commodity shock than are unaffiliated peer firms in the same economy, industry and
time. The primary vulnerability of the findings in Table 3 that remains is that group affiliated
and unaffiliated firms might differ along other firm-level dimensions, some perhaps
unobservable given data constraints. This section presents tests designed to mitigate these
concerns.

4.1.

Mitigating Omitted Variables

Table 1 Panel B shows group affiliated and unaffiliated firms differing from each other in
diversification, leverage, hedging activity, size and R&D activity. We therefore next include
these control variables to mitigate concerns that group affiliation might be proxying for these
other differences in firm characteristics.
A firm diversified across industries may exhibit a muted response to a commodity shock
that affects only some of its industry segments. We also control for each firm’s leverage. The
stock prices of more leveraged firms are plausibly more sensitive to shocks. Group affiliated

20

firms might hedge commodity risk more aggressively to shield the wealth of their controlling
block holders (Tufano, 1996). We proxy for hedging activity in two alternative ways. One is a
hedging indicator set to 1 if Datastream reports that the firm has financial accounts related to
hedging or derivative usage as described in detail above. The second is firm size, reflecting prior
findings showing larger firms to employ more extensive hedging strategies (Nance, Smith, and
Smithson, 1993; Geczy, Minton, and Schrand, 1997; Carter, Rogers, and Simkins, 2006;
Rampini, Sufi, and Viswanathan, 2014). The log of market capitalization or log of total assets
proxies for firm size. We also control for each firm’s R&D spending each year. R&D intensive
firms’ valuations are thought to depend more on future growth opportunities than on current
conditions (and shocks that primarily affect current cash flows). All variables are measured
annually at the prior fiscal year-end.
Table 4 summarizes these regressions, all of which expand regression 3.2 in Table 3 by
including diversification, leverage, R&D activity, total assets or market capitalization and their
interactions with the industry-economy-specific commodity shock. Industries and commodities
are matched using the statistical matching method. Regressions 4.1-4.6 incorporate the new
control variables and matching interactions one pair at a time; regression 4.7 includes them all.
No interaction is statistically significant in 4.1-4.6; however some interactions are significant in
4.7. More importantly, the interaction between the group affiliation indicator and the commodity
shock measure remains uniformly negative and statistically significant. This suggests that
omitting these firm-level characteristics in the previous analyses cannot explain group affiliated
firms’ muted stock price responses to commodity shocks.
Clearly, the tests in this section cannot mitigate all potential concerns about sources of
confounding variation. In particular, the conclusions in this section are subject to the caveat that

21

group-affiliated and unaffiliated firms might differ along other dimensions, including dimensions
unobservable to us due to data limitations.

4.2.

Changes in Group Affiliation: Difference-in-Difference Tests

An alternative identification strategy is based on a difference-in-differences setting, where
changes in group affiliation act as the “treatment”. These difference-in-differences tests explore
differences in how sensitive the firm-specific shocks (in commodity-sensitive industries) to
relevant commodity price shocks before versus after the firms’ status as group affiliated versus
unaffiliated changes (the “treatment” group). These are compared to contemporaneous
differences in the firm-specific shocks of firms whose group affiliation status does not change
(the “control” group). Identification comes from firms whose group affiliation status does not
change serving as a counterfactual for how “treated” firms’ firm-specific stock returns would
have responded to the commodity shocks had their affiliation status not changed. As in all
difference-in-difference tests, the identification assumptions are that omitted firm-level
characteristics do not significantly change around the treatment and that the change in group
affiliation is exogenous. Relaxing these identification assumptions is explored in the next subsection.
The treatment group consists of firms that are unaffiliated in one year and group affiliated
in the following year (positive treatment firms) or affiliated in one year an unaffiliated in the
following (negative treatment). These tests require that the firms we designate as “treated”
genuinely do change affiliation status. Recall that group affiliation is inferred from a firm having
another firm as its controlling shareholder, controlling another firm, or being controlled by a
controlling shareholder who controls another firm. We use a 20% minimum threshold for

22

designating any given equity block sufficient to exercise control, and thus to make a firm a group
affiliate. We do not want blocks that either meet or fail to meet the threshold briefly or by small
margins to count as changes in group affiliation status. The treatment group therefore is
restricted to firms whose group affiliate status changes because the control block(s) relevant to
its status change(s) by at least five percentage points and whose status does not change during
the prior or subsequent two-year periods. This effectively excludes, from the treatment group,
firms attached to their groups due to stakes varying around the threshold because such
fluctuations might reflect seasoned equity issues, share buybacks, stock dividends, or share
creation associated with stock options, rather than genuine changes in group affiliation status.
The data excludes firms that either list or delist within the same windows because differences in
betas cannot be calculated for these firms.
We use propensity scores matching to match each treatment firm with a control firm,
whose group affiliation status does not change, within the same industry, economy, and year
using the nearest neighbor matching (Abadie et al., 2004) by firm size, leverage, R&D over
assets and commodity beta in the prior year (estimated as explained below). If no match is
available from the same country-industry-year, we default to a global match from the same
industry-year. We require differences in propensity scores to be within the 0.05 range. Positively
and negatively treated firms are matched separately. Matching is done with replacement to
preclude the order of the observations from affecting the results.
Commodity betas for each treatment firm and control firm are estimated with respect to
the industry-matched commodity return for each year. This entails estimating a variant of
regression equation [3c] separately for each firm. In these, the explained variable is firm-level
idiosyncratic return shocks and the explanatory variable is the idiosyncratic shock to the

23

commodity matched with the firm’s industry. Firms with fewer than 24 weeks of data are
dropped from the sample, and betas are symmetrically winsorized at the five percent level to
mitigate the impact of outliers. First differences in the commodity betas of each firm are then
calculated. The tests then focus on the difference between treatment and control firms in these
differences in commodity beta.
These difference-in-difference tests, summarized in Table 5, align with the findings in the
previous tables. Group affiliation mitigates the sensitivity firm-specific stock returns to industryspecific commodity price shocks. The commodity beta of unaffiliated firms that become
affiliated (positively treated firms) on average falls significantly, by -3.96 (p-value = 0.00); while
the commodity beta of their nearest neighbor firms, whose group affiliation does not change,
remains constant on average. The commodity beta of affiliated firms that become unaffiliated
(negatively treated firms) on average rises significantly, by 2.88 (p-value = 0.07); while the
average beta of their nearest neighbor firms displays a statistically insignificant decline of -0.45.
The difference-in-difference point estimate for negatively treated firms is a statistically
significant 3.33 (p-value = 0.08). Because the first differences of treated firms are always in the
predicted direction and statistically significant, while those of the nearest neighbor firms are
statistically insignificant, the results are driven by the changes in treated firms rather than
changes in the control group.
Pooling positively and negatively treated firms (after multiplying negatively treated
firms’ differences in commodity beta by minus one) generates a highly statistically significant
difference-in-difference estimate of about -3.57 (p-value = 0.00).
Thus, shocks to the firm-specific returns of group-affiliated firms that become
unaffiliated are immediately more sensitive to commodity price shocks and shocks to the firm-

24

specific returns of unaffiliated firms that become affiliated are immediately less sensitive to
commodity price shocks.

4.3.

Placebo Tests Exploiting Failed M&A Transactions

Identification in the previous section relies on the assumption that firms become affiliated or
unaffiliated for exogenous reasons. If changes in group affiliation status are endogenous, a
sample selection bias problem arises. The results would be also consistent with, for example,
groups taking on firms that are expected to become less sensitive to commodity shocks and
divesting firms expected to become more sensitive to commodity shocks. One approach to
mitigating such concerns follows Seru (2014) in comparing successful control block acquisition
attempts to (unsuccessful) acquisition attempts that failed for plausibly exogenous reasons. If
control block targets are selected in anticipation of changes in their sensitivity to commodity
risk, rather than group affiliation being the cause of those changes, we would observe changes in
the sensitivity to commodity risk also among targets of unsuccessful acquisition attempts.
Control block acquisition attempts recorded in the Thomson One database are merged
with our ownership data. We require that the bidder seek to own at least 20% of the target’s
shares after the transaction and that the target be classified as unaffiliated in the year prior to the
bid. Instances of firms purchasing their own shares are dropped.
The treatment group consists of target firms that are (1) unaffiliated prior to the
acquisition announcement; (2) become group affiliated as a result of a successful acquisition; and
(3) continue to be publicly traded so their commodity betas can be estimated after the
acquisition. The latter requirement is especially important in this context because acquisitions in
most economies entail acquiring a sufficient block of stock to exercise effective control, and are

25

not bids for all of the target firm’s shares as is generally the case in the US.
The control group consists of targets that are (1) unaffiliated prior to the acquisition
announcement; (2) remain unaffiliated because the acquisition attempt failed due to a plausibly
exogenous reason; and (3) continue to be publicly traded after the failed acquisition attempt.
Acquisition bids that failed due to “plausibly exogenous reasons” consist of acquisition attempts,
as reported in Thomson One, that failed because of (1) intervention by regulatory bodies (Savor
and Lu, 2009; Seru, 2014; Faccio and Hsu, 2017); (2) court decisions (Seru, 2014; Faccio and
Hsu, 2017); (3) employee opposition; or (4) unexpected adverse market-wide conditions (e.g.,
the 2008 financial crisis, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, etc., as in Seru, 2014). Acquisition bids
that failed due to fluctuations in commodity prices are excluded, as are takeovers that failed
because a rival bidder acquired a control block. The latter are excluded because the rival’s
takeover is included in the treatment group. The reasons behind the failure of each given
transaction are determined based on the deal description in Thomson One, Capital IQ, and
newspapers articles in Factiva and Lexis-Nexis.
In these tests, identification follows from the targets of unsuccessful acquisition attempts
(placebo treatment firms) serving as counterfactuals for how successfully acquired targets’
(actual treatment firms) sensitivities to commodity shocks would have changed had they not
been acquired.
As in the previous section, we use propensity score matching to match targets of
successful acquisitions with targets of unsuccessful acquisitions within the same economy,
industry and year (if possible) using the nearest neighbor matching (Abadie et al., 2004) using
total assets, leverage, R&D expenses as a fraction of total assets and commodity beta in the prior
year as covariates. If no match is available from the same country, we default to a global match

26

from the same industry-year. As before, the matching is done with replacement.
Betas with respect to industry-matched commodities are estimated for treatment and
control firms over the 52 weeks before and 52 weeks after the takeover announcement date,
excluding the announcement week. Firms with fewer than 24 weeks of observations are dropped
and betas are winsorized at the five percent level.
As Table 6 shows, the results of the tests based on takeover attempts that failed for
plausibly exogenous reasons do align with those in the previous tables. Firm-specific stock
returns become significantly less sensitive to commodity shocks after a firm becomes affiliated
with a business group following a successful takeover, in contrast to control firms that remain
unaffiliated after a takeover attempt that failed for plausibly exogenous reasons. These tests
mitigate the concern that our previous results might be due to self-selection.

4.4.

Within-Group Risk Sharing

If a commodity shock to a one group firm is diffused across the group, other firms in the group
would appear sensitive to the shock. Tests for this “second-hand commodity shock sensitivity”
must therefore focus on business groups containing one or more firms in industries sensitive to a
given commodity and one or more firms in industries insensitive to that commodity. These tests
are best illustrated by a simple example. Consider a business group of three firms: Firm F1 in an
industry sensitive to commodity C1; firm F2 in an industry sensitive to commodity C2; and firm
F3 in an industry insensitive to any commodities. One set of tests explores whether F1 is
sensitive to C2, F2 is sensitive to C1, and F3 is sensitive to both C1 and C2.
We employ a variant of the Fama-Macbeth regressions [4] of the form,

27

𝜀𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑏1 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 𝑠𝑔𝑛(𝛽𝑐,𝑗 ) + 𝑏2 𝜀¬𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 𝑠𝑔𝑛(𝛽¬𝑐,𝑗 ) + 𝑢𝑖,𝑡 .

[5]

As in [4], the explained variable 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 is the firm-specific shock to the return of stock i in week t
from [1]. Unlike in [4], where the explanatory variable 𝜀𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 was idiosyncratic shock to the
price of commodity 𝑐 matched to i’s industry 𝑗 in its economy 𝑚 in week 𝑡; in [5] the
explanatory variable of interest, 𝜀¬𝑐(𝑗),𝑚,𝑡 , is shock to the price of a commodity ¬𝑐(𝑗), which is
not 𝑐(𝑗), but a different commodity matched to the industry of another firm in firm 𝑖’s group. As
in [4], 𝑠𝑔𝑛(𝛽¬𝑐,𝑗 ) is one or minus one as 𝛽¬𝑐,𝑗 is positive or negative, respectively, and inverts
the sign of the explanatory variable if the industry loads negatively on its matched commodity.
If there were no risk sharing across groups, shocks to the industries of a firm’s fellow
group affiliates would not affect its own shares and the regression coefficient 𝑏2 in [5] would be
zero. If group-level risk sharing or income shifting are important, 𝑏2 would be significantly
positive.
Table 7 summarizes Fama-MacBeth regressions of [5]. Regression 7.1 considers firm’s
reaction to all commodities that affect the industries of its fellow group firms but do not affect
the firm’s own industry. The coefficient of 𝑏2 is statistically significant and its point estimate,
0.86 is about 25% of the main coefficient in regression 3.1, which is 3.36. These point estimates
indicate that a second hand commodity shock, affecting the industry of one or more of a firm’s
fellow group affiliates, moves its stock by about 25% as much as does a commodity shock to the
firm’s own industry.
However, commodity shocks are on average positively correlated and even if a firms’
industry does not match with the other group firms’ commodity a positive coefficient may ensue
28

as a result of this correlation. Regression 7.2 controls for the shocks to firms’ own matched
commodity. The coefficient of 𝑏2 is now 0.7 and barely statistically significant at 10%. Second
hand commodity shocks would stand out more clearly if the shocks they echo are larger. To
restrict our analysis to severe second hand commodity shocks, we sort commodity shocks by
their absolute values for each economy and retain only the top quartile of these for each
economy. Regression 7.3 repeats the test with this sample. The coefficient 𝑏2 increases to 1.1
and becomes statistically significant at 2% level. More severe commodity shocks to a firm’s
fellow group affiliates thus tend to affect its own share price more. This indicates that grouplevel risk sharing intensifies in response to more intense commodity shocks to a group member
firm.
Finally, a group affiliate not matched to a commodity might show a stock return response
if its industry is somewhat sensitive to that commodity, but not sensitive enough to meet the tstatistic > 3 matching threshold in regression [3c]. Such a high threshold makes sense for our
other tests, where misattributing commodity sensitivity to an industry that is actually not
commodity sensitive must be avoided. In these tests, we instead need to avoid falsely classifying
a sector as commodity insensitive. To address this concern, we focus on firms in industries that
do not statistically significantly load on any commodity shocks in regression [3c] by requiring
the absolute value of t-statistics of beta to be less than 0.5 for the firms’ industry and commodity
to be included in the test in regression 7.1. Results are displayed in regression 7.410. The
coefficient on other group firm shock is 2.5 and is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.08.
Overall, we find a statistically significant, albeit attenuated, effect in the idiosyncratic
10

In this test the total number of observations is less than 40,000, which corresponds to about 36 observation per
week. We use monthly regressions, instead of weakly, to mitigate concerns related to running cross-sectional
regressions with few observations. When we run Fama-Macbeth regressions at the weekly level, we obtain a
coefficient of 6.2 that is statistically significant with p-value=0.04.

29

stock returns of group firms to shocks to other firms within the same business group. This is
consistent with shocks being spread across firms in the same group.

5.

Robustness Tests

We run a number of robustness tests using the specification in regression 3.2 of Table 3. If the
coefficient of the interaction between group affiliation and idiosyncratic commodity shock
measure is negative and significant at the 10% level, we say that the tests generate results that are
qualitatively similar to those in table 3.

5.1

Alternative Method of Matching Commodities with Industries

An alternative to matching based on statistical significance considers economic significance as
well. The statistical matching method assumes that a more statistically significant loading 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 on
commodity c implies a tighter link between the commodity and industry j. A plausible variant of
the statistical method infers a tighter link if the economic impact of a shock to a commodity
price, defined as the standard deviation of shocks to that commodity multiplied by the point
estimate 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 , is the tightest. This approach matches an industry to the commodity with the
highest economic impact, assessed in this way, whose loading 𝛽𝑐,𝑗 also (1) has a t-statistic
exceeding three in absolute value and (2) retains the same sign in the second step single
regressions as in the first step multivariate regression, as defined above in the description of the
statistical matching method. While new matches emerge, most intuitive matches remain (the list
of matches are available on request). For example, the “Petroleum and Natural Gas” industry
remains matched with the commodity “Crude Oil” because that commodity has both the most
statistically significant and most economically important loading for stock returns in that
30

industry. Regression 8.1 of Table 8, using matches determined by this method, generates results
that are qualitatively similar to those in Table 3.

5.2

Diversification through Share Ownership

We have controlled for firms with sales diversified across industries. Similarly, firms that are at
the top of the business groups pyramids could be diversified if the firms in which they hold
stakes operate in different industries. As a result, firms at the top of pyramids could be less
sensitive to commodity shocks. To mitigate this concern, we repeat our main test using only
firms that are at the bottom of a pyramid. To do this, we drop group affiliates that control other
firms in the sample. Regression 8.2 in Table 8 shows that our results continue to hold when we
focus on firms that are at the bottom of the business group pyramid.

5.3

Alternative Ways of Identifying Business Groups

Our main tests in Table 3 use a 20% threshold for designating a firm’s largest shareholder as its
controlling shareholder. Using a relatively high stake may under-identify group affiliated firms if
smaller stakes suffice to lock in control if other equity is diffusely held and small shareholders do
not vote at shareholder meetings. Erroneously classifying some group-affiliated firms as
unaffiliated introduces attenuation bias in our tests. To explore the sensitivity of our tests to this
concern, we construct an alternative version of the group affiliation indicator variable, 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑖,𝑡 ,
reclassifying controlling shareholders as those with stakes exceeding 15% and then reassessing
group as described in Section 2.1. Regression 8.3 in Table 8, shows that this change yield results

31

qualitatively similar to those in Table 3.11

5.4

Alternative Samples

Our results are not driven by a few economies or extreme observations. For example, regression
8.4 in Table 8, which is also based on the statistical matching, shows that dropping Japan and the
UK (the US is again excluded), which have the largest number of observations, yields
qualitatively similar results.
Qualitatively similar results are ensue after winsorizing firm-specific stock returns and
economy-specific commodity returns at 1% (unreported).
We have roughly 20 years of ownership data in the sample; however, ownership data
coverage becomes more comprehensive in the latter 10 years. Fama-MacBeth regressions give
equal weights to every time period regardless of the number of observations. Dropping the initial
10 years of data and repeating our tests using only the 2003-2013 period yields results,
summarized in regression 8.5 of Table 8, that are qualitatively similar to those in Table 3.

5.5

Alternative Regression Specification

We employ Fama-MacBeth estimation following Jin and Myers (2006) and Petersen’s (2009)
finding that this approach is appropriate in panel regressions explaining abnormal returns. An
alternative is to run panel regressions where we control for country*industry*time fixed effects
and double cluster at the country*industry and business-group level. Regression 8.6 in Table 8
shows that the coefficient of Idiosyncratic Commodity Return * Group Affiliated Firm is
negative and statistically significant although the coefficient is -0.98, which is slightly smaller
11

The number of observations drops slightly when 15% threshold is used because the number of firms identified as
controlled by governments, which are dropped from the sample, increases.

32

than the corresponding coefficients estimated by Fama-MacBeth regressions.

5.6

Alternative Asset Pricing Model

Since our goal is to test whether idiosyncratic shocks are differently incorporated into the stocks
prices of group affiliated firms versus non-affiliates, we focus on the relationship between
idiosyncratic shocks to stock returns and idiosyncratic shocks to commodity prices with respect
to the international version of CAPM developed by Jin and Myers (2006) precisely to provide
such a variance decomposition. A priori we do not expect the Jin and Myers international CAPM
to result in biased estimations of idiosyncratic shocks for group affiliated versus unaffiliated
firms. Nonetheless, it is useful to test whether results are affected by the choice of the particular
asset pricing model.
We use a global version of Fama and French (2015) 5 factor model, where we change
specifications [1] and [2] to include local market returns and Fama-French global 5 factors on the
right hand side in estimating idiosyncratic component of firm and commodity returns,
respectively. Regression 8.7 in Table 8 shows that the coefficient of Idiosyncratic Commodity
Return * Group Affiliated Firm is negative, slightly larger in magnitude than in regression 3.2
and highly statistically significant.

6.

Business Groups and R-squared around the World

We interpret the tests above as evidence that business group affiliation damps firm-specific
shocks associated with commodity price changes. If business group affiliation similarly buffers
other firm-specific shocks, share prices in general might co-move more in economies where
business groups are more important. Therefore, we explore whether firm and economy level

33

stock price co-movement correlates with the incidence of business groups.
To do this, we define the co-movement of firm 𝑖’s stock return with its market return in
year 𝑡 to be
Υi,t = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (

2
𝑅𝑖,𝑡
2 )
1 − 𝑅𝑖,𝑡

[6]

2
where 𝑅𝑖,𝑡
is the regression R-squared statistic of [1] run on weekly returns for each firm in each

year. The logistic transformation [6], which follows Morck et al. (2000), generates a variable
with a roughly normal distribution and that is more positive for stocks whose shares more closely
track market returns and more negative for stocks whose prices move more idiosyncratically.
We then run regressions explaining Υi,t with firm-level group affiliation controlling for
economy-level variables shown elsewhere to correlate with stock return co-movement: log GDP
per capita (Morck, Yeung and Yu, 2000), property rights (Morck, Yeung and Yu, 2000) and
accounting standards (Jin and Myers, 2006).12
Table 9 displays Fama-MacBeth regressions of Υi,t on these explanatory variables. We
use Newey-West estimator with 10 years lag to adjust for persistence in country level variables.
As in prior studies, log GDP per capita attracts a negative coefficient across all specifications and
is uniformly significant. Property rights enters insignificantly if alongside other variables but is
significant when included alone (not reported). These results accord with the prior literature.
The primary variable of interest, Group Affiliation, attracts a positive and significant
coefficient in all specifications. Group-affiliated firms’ stock returns have significantly higher
comovement with their markets or, in other words, less idiosyncratic volatility as a fraction of

total volatility than do unaffiliated firms.
These findings suggest that more pervasive business group affiliation might be added to
the list of economy characteristics associated with greater stock return co-movement. Figure 1
Panel C visually confirms this pattern, with economy level co-movement measure from Morck et
al. (2013) on the vertical axis and the fraction of observations that are form group affiliates, from
Table 1, on the horizontal axis. Stocks in countries with more group affiliated firm observations
have statistically significantly (p=0.09) higher economy level stock return co-movement. The
considerable scatter around the positive correlation line leave abundant room for other
mechanisms and chains of causality.
These findings link the prior literature, surveyed in Morck et al. (2013), explaining more
idiosyncratic stock return co-movement with less developed market institutions to the literature,
surveyed by Khanna and Yafeh (2007), explaining business groups prevalence with less
developed market institutions. And our difference-in-difference findings, especially those using
failed control block bids, also affirm a direction of causation at the firm-level: business group
affiliation damps idiosyncratic stock return volatility, which in return causes share price comovement.13 Firm-level data on business groups causing attenuated commodity shock-related
firm-specific stock return volatility thus provides new economic intuition to explain, partially at
least, economy-level patterns in stock return co-movement.

Conclusions

Business group member firms are less sensitive to commodity shocks than are otherwise similar

13

Khanna and Thomas (2009) find interlocking boards, more than common controlling owners, in Chilean firms
correlated with share price co-movement.

unaffiliated firms at the same time and in the same economy and commodity-sensitive industry.
Difference-in-difference tests are consistent with business group affiliation damping a firm’s
stock return sensitivity to commodity price shocks. Further tests show damped firm-specific
volatility more generally in the stocks of business group affiliates and link cross-economy
differences in overall stock return co-movement to differences in the prevalence of business
groups.
Business groups, as a second best hierarchical allocation mechanism (Coase 1937) in
response to inefficient financial and other markets (Morck et al. 2005; Khanna and Yafeh 2007),
allocate capital internally within the group (Almeida and Wolfenzon, 2006b; Morck, Yavuz and
Yeung 2011). Internal capital markets may also be used to maximize ultimate controlling
shareholders’ private benefits (Bertrand et al. 2002), for example, by siphoning off group
member firms’ firm-specific abnormal earnings (Jin and Myers 2006). The extent to which
business group affiliates’ share price responses to commodity price shocks are attenuated relative
to unaffiliated firms’ share price responses may be a useful empirical variable measuring the
extent to which investors expect business groups to shift resources and risk across their affiliates.
We welcome research using shock sensitivity to better discern how business groups are
governed.
Where markets expect more extensive resource and risk shifting across group affiliates,
their stock prices provide less information feedback to each individual firm’s managers and
capital providers (Bond et al. 2012). That is, by responding to market imperfections with more
active hierarchical allocation, business groups may impair this important information
transmission role of the stock market.

Table 1. Group Affiliated Firms
The Panel A tabulates the count of firm-year observations in our final ownership sample during 1993-2013. Panel B
reports mean characteristics of group affiliated and unaffiliated firms averaged across all available firm-year
observations. We classify firms as group affiliated if they satisfy one of the following criteria: (1) The controlling
shareholder is a corporation (with the exclusion of investment funds); (2) the controlling shareholder is an individual
who controls at least one other firm in our sample; or (3) the firm itself is the controlling shareholder of at least one
other firm in our sample. Firms that do not fit the above classification are classified as unaffiliated firms. State
owned enterprises are excluded from the sample. Market size and total assets are in million USD.

Table 3: Incorporation of Idiosyncratic Information into Stock Prices
The Table reports mean coefficients from Fama-MacBeth cross-section regressions, run separately for each of
1,095 weeks. Industries are matched to commodities using the statistical matching in regressions 3.1 and 3.2,
modified statistical matching in regression 3.3 and 3.4 and BEA matching in regressions 3.5 and 3.6. US firms
are excluded from the sample in the first 4 regressions as they are used to identify the industry-commodity
links. US firms are included in the sample in regressions 3.5 and 3.6. The dependent variable is the weekly
idiosyncratic stock return in local currency, measured from Wednesday to Wednesday. Coefficients are
multiplied by 100. The numbers in parentheses are p-values. Significance levels of means of coefficients from
weekly cross-sectional regressions are adjusted for potential autocorrelation using Newey-West methodology
with 4 lags. Boldface indicates coefficients significant at 10% or better in two-tailed tests.

Table 5. Firms Changing Group Affiliation Status
The table reports a difference-in-differences analysis of changes in the sensitivity of firm-specific stock
returns to commodity price shocks. The treatment group consists of firms experiencing a change in
affiliation status between year t-1 and year t+1, by either becoming group affiliated (positive treatment) or
ceasing to be affiliated to a business group (negative treatment). Group affiliates have a controlling
shareholder with a block of 20% or more; unaffiliated firms do not. Block acquisitions or sales that
change firms’ group affiliation status must be for at least 5% of the firm’s shares. The firm’s group
affiliation must be stable going forward 1 year. The difference (third column) is the sensitivity of firms’
firm-specific stock returns to commodity shocks after the change in group affiliation status minus that
before the change in status. The matched group is firms that did not experience a change in group
affiliation status and that are in the same economy-industry selected using the nearest neighbor matching
on total assets, leverage, R&D expenses/total assets and commodity beta in the year prior to the event.
The sample includes all economies. Coefficients are multiplied by 100. When both positive and negative
treated observations are pooled, the difference-in-differences coefficients of negatively treated
observations are multiplied by -1. Industry-commodity matching is by statistical method. The left hand
side variable is winsorized at the 5% level. Boldface indicates coefficients significance at 10% or better in
two-tailed tests.

Table 6. Targets of Successful Control Block Bids versus Bids that Failed Due to Plausibly
Exogenous Reasons
The table reports a difference-in-differences analysis of changes in idiosyncratic stock returns’ beta with
respect to idiosyncratic commodity shocks. The treated group consists of targets of successful control
block acquisitions, where targets were unaffiliated in the year prior to the bid announcement, which left
the acquirer owning 20% or more of the target’s shares after the transaction. The matched group consists
of targets of similar bids that failed for plausibly exogenous reasons. The targets were unaffiliated in the
year prior to the bid announcement and the acquirer sought to own at least 20% of the target’s shares
after the transaction. Firms in the matched group are selected using nearest neighbor matching criteria
based on total assets, leverage, and R&D expenses/total assets and commodity beta in the year prior to
the acquisition or failed acquisition attempt, and are, when possible, from the same economy-industryyear as each target of successful bid. The sample includes all economies. Industry-commodity matching
is by the statistical method. Coefficients are multiplied by 100. The dependent variable is winsorized at
the 5% level. Boldface indicates coefficients significance at 10% or better in two-tailed tests.

Table 7. Within Group Transmission of Commodity Shocks
The table tests whether a firm’s stock price reacts to commodity shocks to other firms within the same
business group that matches with a commodity other than the firm’s own matched commodity. For this
exercise we use a sample of firms that belong to the same business group, i.e. have a common controlling
shareholder, such that at least two firms of the group are in our sample and at least one of the firms
matches with a different commodity than matched commodities of other group firms. In regression 7.4, we
only include cases that a group firm’s industry beta does not statistically significantly load on the
commodity shocks in regression [3c], i.e. we require the absolute value of t-statistics of beta to be less than
0.5 when commodities are entered individually. The dependent variable is the weekly idiosyncratic stock
return in local currency, measured from Wednesday to Wednesday. Coefficients are multiplied by 100.
The numbers in parentheses are p-values. Estimation is by weekly Fama-MacBeth regressions in
regressions 7.1-7.3 and monthly in 7.4. In regression 7.4 low number of observations results in few
extreme coefficients when Fama-Macbeth regressions are run for each week; in this case the average
coefficient of idiosyncratic commodity shocks to other group firms is 6.2 and p=0.04. We adjust standard
errors for time series autocorrelation of 4 weeks using the Newey-West methodology. Boldface indicates
coefficients significance at 10% or better in two-tailed tests.

Table 8: Robustness Tests
We repeat the test in regression 3.2 of Table 3 using alternative methods and samples. Regression 8.1 modifies the statistically matching as described in
Appendix Table A5. Regression 8.2 drops group affiliated firms that control other firms in the sample. In 8.3 we use a 15% threshold to presume control
and. Regression 8.4 excludes Japan and the UK from the sample. These two economies have the largest number of observations in the sample that already
excludes the US. Regression 8.5 limits the time period to the latest 10 years. Regression 8.6 uses panel data regression instead of Fama-MacBeth.
Regression 8.7 uses local market returns and Fama-French global 5 factors to estimate the idiosyncratic component of stock and commodity returns.
Coefficients were multiplied by 100. The numbers in parentheses are p-values. When we use Fama-MacBeth regressions we adjust the standard errors for
time series autocorrelation of 4 weeks using the Newey-West methodology. Boldface indicates coefficients significance at 10% or better in two-tailed
tests.
