ABSTRACT
This study aims to measure the causal effect of informal caregiving on the health and health care use
of women who are caregivers, using instrumental variables. We use data from South Korea, where
daughters and daughters-in-law are the prevalent source of caregivers for frail elderly parents and
parents-in-law. A key insight of our instrumental variable approach is that having a parent-in-law with
functional limitations increases the probability of providing informal care to that parent-in-law, but
a parent-in-law's functional limitation does not directly affect the daughter-in-law's health. We compare
results for the daughter-in-law and daughter samples to check the assumption of the excludability of
the instruments for the daughter sample. Our results show that providing informal care has significant
adverse effects along multiple dimensions of health for daughter-in-law and daughter caregivers in
South Korea.

1. INTRODUCTION
While much economic research on informal care focuses on the health and health care
use of an elderly parent, informal care may also adversely affect the health of the caregiver.
Several mechanisms may lead to this effect (Schulz et al., 1995). Caregiving can worsen health
through increased emotional stress and physical strain. Caregiving also inevitably involves
observing a loved one’s decline and anticipatory bereavement, which itself may affect the
caregiver’s health (Bobinac et al., 2010; Amirkhanyan and Wolf, 2006). Through these negative
health effects, caregiving may increase a caregiver’s health care use.
The provision of informal care may, however, be endogenous to caregivers' health,
making the modeling of the endogeneity problem important to uncover the true effect (Coe and
Van Houtven, 2009). Health status may affect the individual and family decisions on who
provides informal care ("selection in") as well as whether the caregiver continues or ceases
caregiving ("selection out") (Coe and Van Houtven, 2009). The selection criteria may not be
monotonic in health. While a healthier family member is more likely to take up the caregiving
role because of the burdensome nature of caregiving, it is also possible that a less healthy or less
productive family member may choose to provide informal care instead of participating in paid
employment. Selection out may arise when less healthy caregivers are more likely to stop
providing informal care. This endogeneity issue makes it difficult to untangle the causal effect of
informal caregiving on caregivers' health in observational data.
This study aims to measure the causal effect of caregiving on caregivers' health and
health care use, using instrumental variables (IVs). We use nationally representative data from
South Korea, where daughters and daughters-in-law are the prevalent source of caregivers for
frail elderly parents and parents-in-law. A key insight is that having a parent-in-law with one or

1

more Activity of Daily Living (ADL) limitations increases the probability of providing informal
care to that parent-in-law, but a parent-in-law's ADL limitation does not directly affect the
daughter-in-law's health. We focus, therefore, on daughter-in-law caregivers and use the health
of their parents-in-law as our instruments. We begin with a simple Wald estimator and perform
careful robustness and falsification tests of the instruments to show that our instruments are
theoretically and empirically valid in their application to informal caregiving in South Korea.
This paper makes several contributions to the empirical literature on caregiver health.
First, we estimate the causal effect of caregiving on the health of the caregiver, controlling for
the endogeneity between informal care and health using empirically strong instrumental
variables. Second, we estimate how caregiving affects a caregiver’s own health care use and
expenditures to provide policy-relevant information about how the health effects of caregiving
may translate to public health care costs in an aging society. Third, we use data from South
Korea, which has a unique cultural context about filial duty and caregiving as well as an
emerging strong market of publicly provided long-term care. The unique data source allows us to
estimate caregiver health effects separately for daughters and daughters-in-law, the latter being
an important source of informal care in South Korea. The comparison between daughters and
daughters-in-law is interesting empirically.
We find that informal care has adverse effects on health and health care for daughter-inlaw and daughter caregivers in South Korea. Caregiving has significant spillover effects to
caregiver health care expenditures. For example, compared to their non-caregiving counterparts,
caregiving daughters-in-law annually spend on average 47 percent more out-of-pocket on their
own outpatient costs among those who use any outpatient care.

2. BACKGROUND
A large body of research has found negative health effects of caregiving (for reviews and
meta-analyses see Schulz et al., 1990; Schulz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1995; Bookwala et al.,
2000; Yee and Schulz, 2000; Dilworth-Anderson et al., 2002; Pinquart and Sörensen, 2003;
Vitaliano et al., 2003; Pinquart and Sörensen, 2006; Pinquart and Sörensen, 2007). Despite
considerable differences in the study design and outcome measures, the literature finds that,
compared with non-caregivers, caregivers experience overall poorer psychological and physical
health (Schulz et al., 1995; Pinquart and Sörensen, 2003; Vitaliano et al., 2003).
The main empirical challenge of the literature on caregiver health effects has been that
caregiving (or care intensity among caregivers) is potentially endogenous. In their critical review
of the earlier literature, Barer and Johnson (1990) point out that much of the literature uses selfselected samples. Schulz (1990) also suggests that health status may determine who will provide
informal care in the family. While well acknowledged, this methodological challenge has not
been adequately addressed in the caregiving literature, with one recent exception (Coe and Van
Houtven, 2009). Coe and Van Houtven (2009) address the endogeneity of both selection in and
selection out of caregiving using different sets of instrumental variables. They use the death of a
parent to instrument for selection out of caregiving, and sibling and family characteristics to
instrument for selection into caregiving. In their longitudinal study, they find no evidence of
endogeneity for selecting into caregiving, but do find evidence of endogeneity for selecting out
of caregiving.
We extend the literature by taking into account the endogeneity of informal caregiving in
the instrumental variable framework, using data from an Asian cultural setting — South Korea.
South Korea provides a particularly interesting setting for our empirical work. Although South

3

Korea has become one of the fastest aging societies in the world, its strong tradition of filial piety
means caregiving for frail elderly parents is the responsibility of adult children. Informal
caregiving for disabled parents is embedded as an inseparable component of old-age support in
traditional Korean culture (Sung, 1990), as in other East Asian cultures (Hsu and Shyu, 2003;
Yamamoto and Wallhagen, 1997). Filial piety, an essential element of Confucianism, served as
the major principle for the everyday lives of ordinary people, helping to keep the family as well
as society in harmony (Chee, 2000). In an agrarian society until the 1960s, the Korean extended
family served as a production unit as well as a communal living unit. Traditional Korean
extended families continued with the eldest son’s marriage and intergenerational co-residence
with his parents. An eldest son inherited a larger share of bequests than his siblings would, in the
form of house, farming land, and other real estate assets. The disproportionately larger bequest to
the eldest son implied that the eldest son assumed the greatest role in familial responsibilities,
which included co-residing with, supporting, and caring for elderly parents. The daughter-in-law
married to the eldest son played a central role in familial responsibilities, including caring for ill
and disabled parents. In a sense, the extended Korean family started with a designated future
caregiver, the daughter-in-law, for aging parents (Choi, 1993).
Although the traditional form of parental caregiving is care by the eldest son's wife,
recent decades have seen important changes in attitudes towards parental support. Eldest sons'
wives now are less likely to assume their traditional role of parental caregiving than they were in
the historically patrilineal society; at the same time, daughters increasingly play a greater role in
caring for their own parents. Traditionally, daughters were viewed as leaving their family to join
their husband’s family after marriage, and therefore did not receive equal bequests from their
own parents. A trend toward gender equality coupled with weakening traditional norms has

4

changed this pattern. Therefore, when a woman has both parents and parents-in-law who need
care, it is now less clear for whom she will provide care than in the past. Still, older women,
especially those married to an eldest son, are more likely to uphold the traditional practice of
daughters-in-law sharing the responsibility of caregiving in the husband’s family. A younger
woman who is the eldest daughter in her pre-marriage family and lives close by her parents tends
to play an increasingly greater role in parental caregiving than in the past, suggesting potential
heterogeneity among women who serve as caregivers to their parents or their parents-in-law.
When faced with the competing demands for caregiver time (i.e., a woman has both a parent and
a parent-in-law with limitations), the decision for whom a woman will provide care involves a
more complex set of factors, including her birth order, her husband’s birth order, the availability
of substitutes (e.g., whether both parents-in-law are living together), and geographic proximity.
It is also less clear who should provide parental care in an extended family with several
adult children. Economic theory suggests that the primary informal caregiver selected is more
likely to be the one with the lowest opportunity cost of time, which in turn may be correlated
with poorer health and other socioeconomic disadvantages. There is, however, a growing
consensus among Koreans that “more able” children, who have higher incomes and spacious
houses, should take care of their parents. Despite these changes, parental caregiving by
daughters-in-law and daughters remains the major form of elderly long-term care in South Korea.
In this cultural and institutional context, functional limitations of elderly parents and inlaws can be a strong predictor of caregiving by daughters and daughters-in-law, and therefore a
good source of instruments. However, parental care needs may have direct influences on adult
children's psychological health (Amirkhanyan and Wolf, 2006). Having a functionally dependent
parent may adversely affect the health of adult children, which is termed as "the family effect"

5

independent of "the caregiving effect" (Bobinac et al., 2010). For example, an extra-residential
daughter with a demented mother may still suffer psychological consequences even though she is
not providing informal care to her mother. In the same vein, Amirkhanyan and Wolf (2003)
distinguish non-caregiver stress from caregiver stress. Moreover, parents' functional limitations
may also be correlated with adult children's (but not children-in-law’s) health outcomes through
genetic and behavioral similarities. For example, a 55-year-old daughter of an 85-old-year
mother bedridden with stroke may share an increased susceptibility to many chronic diseases.
There is less concern with instrument validity in models of physical health effects for the sample
of daughters-in-law (where the instruments are functional limitations of parents-in-law, who
obviously have no genetic link to the caregiver). The relatively high prevalence of caregiving by
daughters-in-law in South Korea allows for studying daughter-in-law caregivers separately from
daughter caregivers.
The foregoing discussion provides a conceptual framework for a woman’s caregiving
decisions. Although the functional limitations of elderly parents and parents-in-law are the
primary determinant of this decision, the availability of alternative sources of care, as well as
location and the opportunity cost of time, are also likely to influence the decision process.

3. METHODS
We estimate several models to predict a woman’s adverse health outcome or health care
use (y) as a function of whether she provides informal care to her parents (or parents-in-law) and
other personal characteristics (X).
y = f(Informal care, X)

6

The test of the main hypothesis is whether the coefficient on the informal care variable is
statistically significant. We hypothesize that the coefficient on informal care will be positive,
indicating that women who are informal caregivers have worse health and greater health care
use. The goal is to obtain causal estimates of this relationship.
There are two main econometric issues. First, the dependent variables (health and health
care use) are multifaceted, and therefore can be measured in several different ways. We estimate
two models of health and we estimate both extensive and intensive models of health care use and
costs.
Second, informal care may be endogenous in a model that predicts health. Informal care
is not provided randomly. The decision to provide informal care will depend in part on
unobservable dimensions of health. Whether selection occurs in or out of caregiving, informal
caregivers are likely selected, at least partially, based on health status. We need instrumental
variables to correct for the potential endogeneity of informal care. These instruments must be
correlated with the decision to provide informal care but unrelated directly to the potential
caregiver’s health. We use indicators of any ADL limitations of the mother-in-law and of the
father-in-law as two instruments for the sample of daughters-in-law. Having a parent-in-law with
ADL limitations is highly predictive of providing informal care for that parent-in-law.
Counter examples are instructive. Infectious diseases can spread within families, but we
are not measuring infectious disease. Some health problems are inherited, but in-laws are not
typically closely genetically related. Assortative mating could lead to a correlation in the health
and health behaviors of daughters-in-law and parents-in-law; however, this link cannot be as
strong as the link between daughters and parents. While some women may develop strong
emotional bonds with their in-laws, in general the daughter-in-law will be less emotionally

7

vested in the health decline of the parent-in-law. In short, we argue that a parent-in-law’s health
problems primarily affect a daughter-in-law’s health through caregiving, rather than directly. The
exclusion argument is harder to make for daughters caring for their parents due to heritability
and closeness, but for completeness and comparison we also estimate models with daughters as
caregivers.
Before running the full IV models, we first obtain Wald estimators for each of our health
outcome measures to show the plausibility of the proposed instruments and the rough estimate of
the magnitude of the effect. The simple Wald estimator is calculated as follows (Angrist and
Evans, 1998). Consider the following regression model.
y = α + βIC + ε
where y is a health outcome measure, and IC is the endogenous binary variable of interest,
whether the respondent provided any informal care. Let α be the constant term and β be the
coefficient of interest. The random error is ε. Now we consider a binary instrument (z) for the
sample of daughters-in-law  whether either parent-in-law has any ADL limitations (z=1 if any
ADL limitations, 0 otherwise). The IV-Wald estimate of β is the ratio of two differences. The
numerator is the difference between the expected value of y for those whose parents-in-law have
ADL limitations ( y1 ) and for those whose parents-in-law do not have ADL limitations ( y 0 ).
The denominator is the difference between the expected value of informal care for those whose
parents-in-law have ADL limitations ( IC 1 ) and for those whose parents-in-law do not have
ADL limitations ( IC 0 ). The estimate βIV-Wald is the average treatment effect of informal
caregiving on a particular health outcome in question (y) for the subgroup of individuals whose
probability of providing informal care (IC) has been affected by having a parent-in-law with any
ADL limitations (z).
8

 IV Wald 

( y1  y 0 )
( IC 1  IC 0 )

In this sense, βIV-Wald can be interpreted as a local average treatment effect (LATE) (Imbens and
Angrist, 1994; Angrist et al., 1996; Angrist and Evans, 1998). Robust standard errors for these
Wald estimators can be easily obtained by running regression models with the only endogenous
explanatory variable of informal care for parent(s)-in-law and one IV of whether either parent-inlaw has ADL limitations. In a similar way, we also calculate Wald estimators for the samples of
daughters, using a different binary instrument of whether either mother or father has any ADL
limitations.
As a next step, we conduct falsification tests of the Wald estimator by using the wrongly
matched instrument for each sample; namely using the instrument of whether either mother or
father has any ADL limitations to predict the probability of providing informal care for parentsin-law for the sample of daughters-in-law, and using the instrument of whether either the motherin-law or father-in-law has any ADL limitations to predict the probability of providing informal
care for parents for the sample of daughters. The Wald estimators from these falsification tests
should not produce sensible results.
We then estimate the full IV models controlling for other observable characteristics.
These other characteristics include daughter(-in-law)'s age, education, wealth, home ownership,
health insurance, and whether both parents(-in-law) are living together. In this step, we use two
instruments for each sample, allowing for overidentification: whether the mother-in-law has any
ADL limitations (z1) and whether the father-in-law has any ADL limitations (z2) for the sample
of daughters-in-law, and whether the mother has any ADL limitations (z1) and whether the father
has any ADL limitations (z2) for the sample of daughters. We use specification tests to assess the
instrument validity and the exogeneity of the potentially endogenous variable of informal care.
9

Another potential method of dealing with endogeneity is to use longitudinal data and
exploit within-individual variations while also possibly controlling for baseline health status
(Coe and Van Houtven, 2009). Our data from South Korea have only three waves and thus have
limited variation between waves in key variables. We estimated random- and fixed-effects
models as well as models including lagged health variables, but found most estimation methods
show signs of insufficient variation and limited sample size, particularly for the models with a
binary dependent variable. Given the data limitations, our preferred method is the IV model
using repeated observations.
As a sensitivity test, we repeat our analysis using logged informal care hours instead of
the indicator variable of informal caregiving, and examine whether accounting for the extent of
caregiving changes our main results. Because the results from the alternative specification
remain largely similar, we present our results using the specification of the indicator variable of
informal caregiving. Other results are available upon request.

4. DATA
This study uses data from the first three waves (2006, 2008, and 2010) of the Korean
Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA). The KLoSA is a nationally representative study of noninstitutionalized South Korean adults aged 45 or older in 15 large administrative areas. The
KLoSA is designed to be comparable to aging panel studies from other regions, including the US
Health and Retirement Study and the European Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe (Boo
and Chang, 2006). The KLoSA contains detailed information on the respondents as well as their
children, siblings, and parents. In its first wave, conducted in 2006, 10,254 individuals (5,788
women) in 6,171 households were interviewed face-to-face using the computer-assisted personal

10

interviewing method. In the second (2008) and third (2010) waves, 84.7% and 77.2% of the
original sample were respectively followed up without replacement.
We restrict our study sample to women with any living parents-in-law and women with
any living parents, leaving 2,531observations in the daughter-in-law sample and 4,110
observations in the daughter sample. Because information on parents-in-law can only be
identified among currently married women in our data, the daughter-in-law sample is smaller in
number than the daughter sample. There are 1,348 observations with both “any living parents-inlaw” and “any living parents.” After removing five observations with missing values for the
study variables, our main statistical analysis uses the final daughter-in-law (N=2,528) and
daughter (N=4,108) samples.

4.1. Outcome Variables
Various outcome measures have been used to capture the effects of informal caregiving
on psychological and physical health as well as on health care use and medication (Schulz, 1990;
Haley et al., 1987; Pang, 2000; Yong and McCallion, 2003). In this study, we focus on physical
health outcomes, and health care use and costs, rather than psychological health outcomes,
because of the concern that psychological outcomes are likely prone to the family effect
(Bobinac et al., 2010).
First, we define a dichotomous variable indicating pain affecting daily activities.
Caregiving often involves physical efforts and may produce physical pain. Moreover, individuals
with psychological distress often present with physical symptoms, which is known as
somatization (Pang, 2000). While this argument for somatization may raise the concern that pain
can result from the family effect, we believe this concern is lessened among daughter-in-law

11

caregivers. Second, we construct a binary variable of fair to poor self-rated health to capture
overall subjective health. Although additional health variables are available from the data, most
of these variables are excluded because their psychological or disease-specific nature fails to
meet two criteria: being able to capture physical health and being sufficiently generic.
Our health care use and costs variables are derived from information on outpatient care
use and regular prescription drug use in the past 12 months. We define a binary indicator
variable of any outpatient care use = 1 if the respondent reported having visited a doctor’s office
and hospital outpatient office, including the emergency room, at least once in the past 12 months.
For those with any outpatient care use, we create a continuous variable of the total out-of-pocket
spending for outpatient care paid by the respondent during the same period. We also create two
variables for regular prescription drug use in the same way as for outpatient care use: any regular
prescription drug use and out-of-pocket spending for regular prescription drug use conditional
on any use during the past 12 months. We focus on the use of outpatient care and prescription
drugs, rather than inpatient care use and other types of health care use that may be limited in
capturing the patient’s overall health status. Although our measures of health care use and costs
may reflect influences other than health status itself (e.g., insurance status and health seeking
behavior) and possibly pose concerns over the accuracy of reporting, we choose to use these
measures because they are relatively objective and they allow for summarizing multiple sources
of the negative health effects of caregiving. In presenting the potential effect of caregiving on
health care financing, the use of these measures becomes highly policy relevant. Because the
distribution of out-of-pocket spending shows the typical right-skewed pattern, we tested for the
most appropriate Box-Cox transformation and use the natural logarithm of these two cost

12

variables.

4.2. Explanatory Variables
The key explanatory variable is a binary indicator variable of any informal care provided
to parents-in-law (daughter-in-law sample) or a binary variable of any informal care provided to
parents (daughter sample). In the KLoSA, ADL care was asked regardless of co-residential status,
but IADL care was only asked about care provided to non-co-residing parents(-in-law).
Our statistical models control for a set of demographic and socioeconomic factors,
including age, education, home ownership, health insurance status, whether both parents(-in-law)
are living together, type of residential area, and survey year. In South Korea, every Korean
citizen is insured by either National Health Insurance or Medical Aid. Medical Aid, which is a
public assistance program for the poor and other specified groups, has two types. Medical Aid
Type 1 is for the poorer among the poor, and charges lower out-of-pocket costs than Type 2. In
addition to these statutory medical security programs, individuals can purchase supplemental
voluntary private health insurance for protection from the financial burden of out-of-pocket
medical expenditures.

5. RESULTS
The main instrument is largely balanced across other covariates, providing evidence that
the instrument is unlikely to be correlated with anything other than the probability of being a
caregiver. Comparisons of the daughters-in-law by having at least one parent-in-law with ADL
limitations (Table 1A) show that the women are similar on all measured characteristics except
age, home ownership and, of course, caregiver status. Women with at least one parent-in-law

13

with ADL limitations are slightly older on average (55.3 years versus 53.3 years) and are more
likely to own a home; 60.0% of these women provided informal care to their parents-in-law
compared with only 0.2% (4 out of 2,433) of the women who had parents-in-law without ADL
limitations. These four caregivers are non-residential caregivers who provided IADL care only.
Thus, parent-in-law ADL limitations satisfy one criteria for a good instrument, namely that it be
highly correlated with the potentially endogenous variable. The Wald estimators based on ADL
limitations for at least one parent-in-law show statistically significant adverse health effects
(p<0.1) in the outcome measures except for any outpatient care use and the log of out-of-pocket
prescription drug costs, conditional on any regular prescription drug use (see Table 1B). The
basic results also hold for the estimates that control for other covariates, as will be shown later.
Group comparisons and Wald estimators for the daughter sample show similar patterns
(Table 2), although daughters having parent(s) with ADL limitations are also less educated, more
likely to be on the Medical Aid program, and are slightly older. Among daughters having
parent(s) with any ADL limitations, 26.3% provided informal care to their parent(s), while
informal caregiving was reported by only 0.3% (=10/3850) of women whose parent(s) had no
ADL limitations (last row of Table 2A). The Wald estimator for the difference in outcomes
measures based on parental ADL limitations show significant adverse effects (p<0.05) for all
outcome measures except the log of out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, conditional on any
regular prescription drug use (Table 2B).
The falsification tests for the Wald estimators in Table 3 (based on the effect of parental
ADL limitation on the probability of providing informal care for parents-in-law in the daughterin-law sample and that of parent-in-law ADL limitation on the probability of providing informal
care for parents in the daughter sample) show no statistically significant adverse health outcomes

14

(p<0.10), even suggesting beneficial effects. The estimated differences in outcomes are
extremely large for many measures and have large standard errors. The erratic results from using
a “nonsensical” instrument for each sample, combined with the Wald estimators shown in Tables
1B and 2B, suggest that the differential probabilities of providing parental care induced by
conceptually appealing instruments (i.e., the presence of functionally dependent parents or
parents-in-law for the corresponding sample of daughters or daughters-in-law) can be used to
identify the estimated health effects of caregiving. Therefore, the main limitation of the Wald
estimators in Tables 1B and 2B is the fact that they are based only on the allocation into groups
according to ADL status of parents (for the daughter sample) and parents-in-law (for the
daughter-in-law sample) and do not adjust for any of the observed characteristics of the women.
The relatively high proportions of women (daughters or daughters-in-law) who respond
to the corresponding instruments of ADL status (for parents or parents-in-law) by providing care,
and the negligible proportion of women providing care for parents or parents-in-law without
ADL limitations suggest that the instruments should have a strong predictive power in the firststage regression (Angrist et al., 1996). Indeed, the indicators of ADL limitations among parents
or parents-in-law are essentially the most important predictors of informal caregiving by
daughters or daughters-in-law (Table 4), which is not surprising since those IVs are the reason
for providing parental care. The F-test at the bottom of Table 4 indicates the instruments are
strong (F-statistics 86 and 37). In contrast, most other factors have small coefficients and fail to
reach statistical significance at the 10% level. All else being equal, having both parents(-in-law)
living together reduces the probability of a daughter(-in-law) providing care by 0.8 (1.4)
percentage points, and these effects are statistically significant despite the small magnitude. The

15

surprisingly small magnitude is likely reflected in the small proportion (<20%) of daughters(-inlaw) with both parents(-in-law) living together in our study sample (Tables 1 and 2).
Table 5 provides the IV estimates of the effect of caregiving on health outcomes and the
results from specification tests (for overidentification and exogeneity) for the separate samples of
daughters-in-law and daughters. The tests for overidentification (column 8) show support for
valid identification in all models. The tests for exogeneity are more equivocal, with statistical
evidence of endogeneity in five of the 12 models estimated.
For the daughter-in-law sample, the models show an adverse impact of caregiving on
caregiver health for the following outcome measures (p<0.10, the magnitude of effect in
parenthesis): having pain affecting daily activities (13 percentage points), having fair or poor
self-reported health (16 percentage points), and out-of-pocket outpatient care costs if any use (47
percent), although the specification test does not reject exogeneity of the IV-Probit estimates.
For the daughter sample, the models show an adverse impact of caregiving on caregiver
health for the following outcome measures (p<0.10, the magnitude of effect in parenthesis):
having pain affecting daily activities (41 percentage points), having fair or poor self-reported
health (56 percentage points), having any outpatient care use (30 percentage points), out-ofpocket outpatient care costs if any use (75 percent) and having any regular prescription drug use
(34 percentage points).
No beneficial and statistically significant impacts on health outcomes from caregiving
were estimated for any model, as expected. Therefore, although controlling for additional
covariates in a full IV framework reduced the number of health measures with adverse impacts
from caregiving, adverse impacts from caregiving appears to have occurred for a number of
measures. We find that most of the coefficient estimates on the alternative specification of

16

logged informal care hours do not change qualitatively from the coefficient estimates on the
indicator variable of caregiving (Table 6), suggesting the robustness of our results.

6. DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that informal care has adverse health effects along multiple
dimensions for daughter-in-law caregivers in South Korea. Our study has carefully tested for the
possibility that selection into caregivers by health status might affect the estimation results of
caregiver health effects. In doing so, we show IV estimation can help control for endogeneity,
starting with more intuitive Wald estimators.
The main methodological contribution of this paper is that our IV approach solves the
problem of endogeneity and allows us to estimate causal parameters. The LATE interpretation is
directly meaningful because the instruments are directly related to why most informal care is
provided. Informal care is more likely provided when an elderly family member has more ADL
limitations. Finding appropriate instruments has been a problem in this literature, making most of
the published results inconclusive about the causal effects of informal caregiving on caregivers'
health.
This study has limitations. First, because of the multiple eligibility criteria required for
our IV estimation (e.g., currently married women aged 45 and over with any living parent-inlaw) combined with the strict definition of caregiving in the data (i.e., not including coresidential IADL caregiving), our daughter-in-law sample has a modest size with a small number
of caregivers, even after three waves of data are combined. One related concern is that our
estimates may have been influenced by possible outliers when outcome variables are continuous.
Further examining our data, however, excludes this possibility because extreme outliers for the

17

two continuous outcome variables were observed in the comparison group (i.e., non-caregiver)
rather than the treatment group (i.e., caregiver). Second, we focus on obtaining valid populationlevel estimates of the health effects of informal care, and our models do not account for specific
caregiving contexts. Our data do not allow for examining contextual factors: whether the care
recipient showed problem behaviors often seen in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia; how
important the caregiver’s choice was in the caregiving decision; what the quality of the dyadic
relationship between caregiver and care recipient was; what the main type of caregiving tasks
was; and whether the caregiver had role conflict. These limitations, of course, apply to all studies
that use large national data sets. Although many of these factors may moderate the health effects
of caregiving, several subgroup analyses attempted were limited by small sample sizes even
when necessary variables were available. Third, our data do not allow for examining potentially
differential effects by phase and duration of caregiving. On the one hand, caregiver health effects
can be more pronounced in the earlier phases than later phases. New caregivers may experience
numerous changes in their lives and suffer adverse health effects. On the other hand, it is also
possible that caregivers who have provided care for an extended period may have poorer health
outcomes than new caregivers. The accumulation of longitudinal data would help in accounting
for this heterogeneity in future research.
Despite these limitations, we found statistically significant effects of providing informal
care on the health of caregivers. In addition to effects on specific measures of health, we found
that health care costs of caregivers increased. Thus, given the public financing of health care in
South Korea, there are potential tradeoffs between encouraging informal care over long-term
care for elders and expending more on the caregiver’s health care.

18

Our study has two policy implications. First, the results support the perspective that
informal caregiving is an emerging public health issue (Talley and Crews, 2007). Our results
suggest that caregivers may suffer multiple negative health effects across many domains of
physical health. Given the demographic trends in South Korea and a strong tradition of informal
care, the number of female informal caregivers will likely grow sharply.
Second, our results on increased health care costs among informal caregivers suggest that
informal caregiving also has direct economic costs that partially offset any savings from lower
formal health care costs for elderly. Estimating the costs of informal care has traditionally
focused on the opportunity costs of caregivers’ time (Arno et al., 1999; Van Houtven and Norton,
2008). Our results, however, suggest that cost-effectiveness analyses related to long-term care
policies also need to take into account the health care costs associated with informal caregiving.
