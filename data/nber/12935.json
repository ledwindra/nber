    "abstract": "\n\nRecent research has argued that psychological well-being is U-shaped through the life cycle.  The difficulty with such a claim is that there are likely to be omitted cohort effects (earlier generations may have been born in, say, particularly good or bad times).  Hence the apparent U may be an artifact.  Using data on approximately 500,000 Americans and Europeans, this paper designs a test that makes it possible to allow for different birth-cohorts.  A robust U-shape of happiness in age is found.  Ceteris paribus, well-being reaches a minimum, on both sides of the Atlantic, in people's mid to late 40s.  The paper also shows that in the United States the well-being of successive birth-cohorts has gradually fallen through time.  In Europe, newer birth-cohorts are happier.\n\n",
