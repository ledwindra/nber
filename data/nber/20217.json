    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide new theory and evidence on the role of external and internal integration in structural transformation and economic development using Argentina\u2019s integration into the world economy in the late-19th century. Our theoretical model provides microfoundations for a spatial Balassa-Samuelson effect, in which locations closer to world markets have higher population densities, urban population shares, relative prices of non-traded goods, and land prices relative to wages, and specialize in transport-cost-sensitive traded goods. We estimate the model\u2019s parameters, provide evidence in support of this spatial Balassa-Samuelson mechanism, and find substantial effects of both external and internal integration on economic development.\n\n",
