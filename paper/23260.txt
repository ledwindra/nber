ABSTRACT
We formalize pass-through over-shifting as a simple yet under-utilized test for market power. We
apply this test in the market for solar energy. Specifically, we estimate the pass-through of solar
subsidies to solar system prices using rich micro-level transaction and subsidy data from
California. Buyers of solar systems capture nearly the full subsidy, while there is more-thancomplete pass-through to lessees. We conclude that solar markets are imperfectly competitive by
ruling out alternative explanations for over-shifting, and reinforce this conclusion with a test of
solar demand curvature. This procedure can serve to detect market power beyond the solar
market.

Introduction

Pass-through of taxes and subsidies—or more generally, cost shocks—to prices plays an important
role in economic analysis and policy evaluation across numerous fields of economics. In public
economics, pass-through holds a prominent position in the theory of tax incidence and distributional
equity (Busse et al. 2006; Marion and Muehlegger 2011; Sallee 2011; Weyl and Fabinger 2013; Ito
2015; Ganapati et al. 2016; Kopczuk et al. 2016). The topic has also attracted considerable attention
in industrial organization, particularly because pass-through can elucidate the welfare implications
from various types of price discrimination or imperfect competition (Fabra and Reguant 2014).
Under certain conditions, there is a direct connection between pass-through and the existence
of market power. While theory predicts—and empirical studies confirm—that pass-through rates
fall between 0 and 100 percent across a wide range of market structures, those above 100 percent
cannot be ruled out theoretically. Such “over-shifting” is not just an economic curiosity. In fact,
it is often observed (Besley and Rosen 1999; Delipalla and O’Donnell 2001; Kenkel 2005). More
importantly, it can reveal important characteristics about supply, demand, or market power, as
theory only rationalizes it under a narrow set of assumptions. For example, the theory of incidence
tells us that markets characterized by various forms of imperfect competition exhibit over-shifting
if demand is very convex (Seade 1985; Weyl and Fabinger 2013).
In this paper, we formalize under what conditions over-shifting can be used as a simple and
direct test for market power and demonstrate how estimating demand convexity can corroborate
such a conclusion. In doing so, we strengthen the connection between theory and data which
has remained loose in existing empirical papers that find over-shifting and discuss the presence of
market power as a way to explain their findings.1 We provide alternative explanations for overshifting that do not rely on imperfect competition and argue that they are unlikely to be relevant
in many markets. Thus, when judiciously applied, a finding of over-shifting from a straightforward
pass-through estimation can serve as evidence of market power, without the need for a structural
model of the market in question.
We study these issues in an important empirical setting that, perhaps surprisingly, exhibits
pass-through over-shifting: the market for residential solar systems in California, where about half
of all U.S. residential solar systems are located (Borenstein 2017).2 The availability of transactionlevel microdata makes solar markets well-suited for econometric estimation of subsidy pass-through.
Furthermore, beyond its exposition of over-shifting, this market is especially interesting and important in its own right. Governments around the world spent $120 billion subsidizing renewables
1
Ritz (2015) points out that the empirical literature has rarely tested whether standard theory can explain specific
pass-through patterns. The context discussed is asymmetric pass-through, but the same observation applies for overshifting and other “surprising” patterns of pass-through.
2
Governments use these subsidies to (indirectly) address environmental externalities by increasing renewable energy uptake. Another motivation is to correct for non-appropriable learning-by-doing spillovers in solar installation
technology (van Benthem et al. 2008; Bollinger and Gillingham 2014). While the impact of solar subsidies on solar
system adoptions has been studied (Burr 2014; Hughes and Podolefsky 2015), much less is known about their passthrough to consumers, which is a crucial input in the calculation of who ultimately benefits from the subsidies (i.e.,
the economic incidence).

in 2014 and $50 billion on solar alone (International Energy Agency 2016). In the United States,
it is not unusual for federal- and state-level incentives to add up to half the total system costs
(Gillingham and Tsvetanov 2017).
There are several other unique characteristics that make the solar market particularly interesting
from an economist’s perspective. First, solar adopters use different system ownership structures—
namely, host-ownership (HO) versus third-party ownership (TPO)—analogous to buying versus
leasing in other markets such as the automobile market. We can therefore estimate how passthrough differs between owners and lessees of the same product. Such comparisons are rare in
the literature. Second, the incidence of renewable energy subsidies has been a topic of intense
debate and there are direct concerns about low pass-through in the TPO solar market.3 Consumer
advocacy groups have accused solar companies of deceptive sales tactics (Greentech Media 2016)
and “scamming” homeowners out of their tax credits instead of transferring them to consumers
(Watchdog Wire 2014). Lastly, and central to the focus of this paper, there have been worries
about market power in solar markets (Gillingham et al. 2016; Nemet et al. 2017; Pless et al. 2017).
In fact, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission held a workshop in 2016 to examine a variety of solar
market competition issues (Kalpin et al. 2016). Market power concerns are particularly pertinent in
the TPO context as a number of mergers between financing and installation companies have taken
place. These vertically integrated firms include some of the industry’s biggest players like SolarCity
and Vivint who controlled 34 percent of the market in 2013 (McIntosh and Mandel 2014).4
We therefore estimate pass-through for both HO and TPO systems, test if they differ and
exceed 100 percent, and if so, if we can take this as evidence that the solar market is imperfectly
competitive. To further connect our empirical results with theory, we estimate demand curves in
a sufficiently flexible form that allows us to test if our over-shifting finding is consistent with our
estimated curvature of demand.
Specifically, we study the multi-billion dollar California Solar Initiative (CSI) program, the
largest state rebate program for solar so far in the United States, which provides lump-sum upfront
payments for solar system installations. An attractive econometric feature of the program is that it
involved sharp drops in rebate levels across time and space. We collect solar system-level data on
rebates received and system characteristics. However, while public data include transaction prices
for HO systems, the prices for TPO systems are known to be inconsistently reported, making any
analysis of TPO systems using CSI data “fundamentally flawed” (Greentech Media 2013). A novel
feature of our analysis is that we construct (post-incentive) prices for TPO systems by calculating
the (subsidy-inclusive) net present cost based upon actual contract terms—such as monthly lease
3

A separate incidence concern relates to regressivity. Borenstein and Davis (2016) show that most clean energy
tax incentives, including solar subsidies, are highly regressive: the top income quintile has received about 60 percent
of all government support.
4
Green subsidies have also been criticized for having mixed environmental success due to infra-marginal uptake.
They suffer from an additionality problem as some green behavior would occur even in absence of the subsidies.
Boomhower and Davis (2014) study how this problem affects the cost-effectiveness of an energy-efficient appliance
subsidy program in Mexico and find that about half of the participants would have adopted the technology with no
subsidy. Accounting for the additionality problem, Ito (2015) finds that energy conservation subsidies in California
did not lead to any conservation in coastal areas (though it did in inland regions).

payments, term lengths, upfront payments, and more—agreed upon between customers and third
parties. This entailed sampling and transcribing about 2,000 TPO contracts to build a database
of TPO contract terms.
We estimate the pass-through rate of the CSI rebate to post-incentive system prices for both
HO and TPO customers. Intuitively, the main identifying variation that we leverage comes from
large and sudden jumps in rebate levels—across utility territories and over time—relative to smooth
price trends that control for pricing trends such as declining costs and technology uncertainty. As
with any empirical study of a specific market, our strategy yields a pass-through estimate local to
the market conditions in California. With that said, the California solar market is large and often
predictive of nationwide or even global solar trends. Therefore, results from California should be
of interest to policy makers in many states and countries who are increasingly interested in how
the benefits of green subsidies accrue across different types of consumers and firms.
We find that pass-through is remarkably high and differs substantially for consumers who buy
versus lease solar systems. Consumers who buy capture nearly the full subsidy amount—about
78 cents for every dollar increase in subsidies—while there is more-than-complete pass-through to
consumers who lease. For lessees, our estimates imply that a $1 increase in subsidies translates,
on average, into a decrease in solar system prices of $1.53. We thus find that solar subsidies are
predominantly or more than fully passed through to consumers, despite popular claims to the
contrary. We also conclude that—even as the burden of a subsidy drop (or the benefits of a subsidy
increase) shifts from consumers to firms as the market becomes less competitive—consumers likely
receive a large majority of the extra surplus when subsidies increase, regardless of the market
structure.
The difference in pass-through rates between buyers and lessees is striking considering both
markets offer nearly the same product. Nonetheless, several factors could explain this, such as
consumer selection and differences in market structure. Perhaps even more surprisingly, however,
is that we find substantial over-shifting in the leasing market. It is natural to ask what explains
this over-shifting. Imperfect competition combined with “sufficiently convex” demand is a leading
explanation, but there exist other conditions under which over-shifting can occur. We formalize pass-through over-shifting as an under-utilized test for market power by outlining alternative
explanations that need to be ruled out.
These alternative explanations are uncommon in most markets and certainly unlikely to apply
to the solar market. We demonstrate that over-shifting can occur in competitive markets in the
presence of Giffen behavior, decreasing marginal costs, nominal pricing rigidities (Conlon and Rao
2016) or—by extending the analysis in Kopczuk et al. (2016)—when firms can inflate their subsidy
amounts in a manner unobserved to the econometrician. Such manipulation is nearly impossible
in the context of the CSI rebate, although TPO installers have allegedly inflated federal solar tax
credits (Greentech Media 2013). These practices do not affect our analysis, however. We also
demonstrate that tax salience, while clearly affecting pass-through (Chetty et al. 2009), cannot
explain over-shifting in a perfectly competitive market. Hence, except under conditions that are

4

unlikely in most markets, over-shifting implies imperfect competition.
Finally, we connect the theory of pass-through over-shifting under imperfect competition—which
we argue can be only rationalized by sufficiently convex demand in the setting of the California
solar market—with an empirical test of demand curvature. While this may seem to be a natural
test to perform in an empirical paper that reports pass-through above unity, earlier papers have
not explicitly made this connection.5 We estimate demand for solar systems in the HO and TPO
markets separately and, subject to a range of caveats, find that the curvature of demand in the
solar sector appears broadly consistent with the possibility of over-shifting. This is—to the best of
our knowledge—the first empirical test of consistency between over-shifting and demand curvature
and allows us to provide supporting evidence for our empirical findings and our conclusion about
the presence of market power. The feasibility of such a supporting demand curvature test depends
on the availability of sufficiently rich data, which may not be available in all settings.
There is a rich empirical literature on tax incidence and pass-through, with most papers finding
pass-through rates between 0 and 100 percent (see, e.g., Nakamura and Zerom 2010; Goldberg
and Hellerstein 2013). Studies also occasionally document over-shifting. For example, analyses
of alcohol taxes (Young and Bielinska-Kwapisz 2002; Kenkel 2005), cigarette taxes (Barzel 1976;
Barnett et al. 1995; Delipalla and O’Donnell 2001), and—in some cases—fuel taxes (Stolper 2016)
have found that pass-through exceeds unity.6 In fact, more than complete pass-through is actually
quite common. Besley and Rosen (1999) study pass-through patterns of transaction taxes for many
commodities and find evidence of over-shifting for more than half of them, such as milk, shampoo,
and soda.
This paper makes several contributions. First, and most importantly, we show under what
conditions a straightforward pass-through estimation can serve as a useful diagnostic test for market
power, and how estimating demand convexity—in addition to ruling out alternative explanations—
can corroborate such a conclusion. A positive result justifies further investigation by economists
and competition authorities, for instance using detailed structural modelling that can shed light on
market structure, markups, and the deadweight loss from imperfect competition.
Our pass-through estimates also contribute to the literature on renewable energy subsidies and
leasing markets. Pass-through rates serve as important inputs in other calculations such as the
incidence of taxes or subsidies under a range of assumptions about competition (Ganapati et al.
2016). Our findings suggest that subsidy incidence falls primarily on the consumer. We are the
first to find over-shifting in clean energy markets, and as one of the few papers to estimate how
pass-through differs between owners and lessees of the same product, this paper is the first to
5

Several papers (see, e.g., Besley and Rosen (1999) and several more that are cited in the next paragraph) discuss—
but do not test for—demand convexity as a potential explanation for over-shifting. Stolper (2016) uses measures of
market concentration and spatial isolation to explain pass-through patterns, but the paper does not empirically test
for demand convexity either.
6
Marion and Muehlegger (2011) also find that pass-through exceeds unity in gasoline markets, however the result
is not statistically distinguishable from 100 percent. Furthermore, while the main finding in Ganapati et al. (2016)
is incomplete pass-through in the U.S. manufacturing context, they note that over-shifting also occurs in industries
with inelastic demand and/or relatively high markups.

find over-shifting in a leasing context.7 Despite the widespread use of leasing, other studies of
solar subsidy pass-through have not estimated pass-through for lessees because of data limitations,
which we overcome by obtaining TPO contracts (Podolefsky 2013; Dong et al. 2016; Gillingham
and Tsvetanov 2017). In fact, to the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to differentially
estimate pass-through for owners and lessees in any non-property setting.8
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out the theory of pass-through under perfect
and imperfect competition. Section 3 details institutional facts about solar energy subsidies and
describes the data that we use. Section 4 discusses our empirical strategy and presents solar subsidy
pass-through estimation results and their robustness. In Section 5, we discuss alternative explanations of over-shifting besides market power and conclude that they are highly unlikely in our
context. Section 6 describes how we flexibly estimate demand to perform an empirical test of consistency between demand curvature and over-shifting theory, and connect this to our pass-through
estimates. We conclude in Section 7.

Theory of Pass-Through and Market Power

Under the commonly applied simplifying assumptions of perfect competition, upward sloping supply, and downward sloping demand, economic theory predicts that the absolute pass-through of
a tax or subsidy to consumers ranges between 0 and 100 percent. However, (local) pass-through
varies substantially according to the slopes and shapes of demand and supply curves, as well as the
level of market competition. Pass-through even exceeds 100 percent under certain conditions, and
as previously noted, such “over-shifting” is not unheard of.
To explore how over-shifting can occur, we begin with a discussion of pass-through theory under
the standard assumptions of a competitive market with upward sloping supply and downward
sloping demand as a baseline. Both consumers and producers take prices as given and choose
quantities that maximize their welfare. Let p be the price paid by consumers. Suppliers pay a perunit tax t and therefore receive price p − t. All firms are identical and there is a single market price
that equates aggregate demand and competitive supply in equilibrium so that D(p) = S(p − t). We
then ask how an increase in the per-unit tax (or analogously, a per-unit subsidy) affects prices. It is
common to think of producers directly bearing the cost or benefit and then “passing through” the
tax or subsidy indirectly to consumers. We are thus interested in the pass-through rate, ρ = dp/dt,
7

The paper also contributes to the small but growing literature on subsidy incidence, which has received less
attention than tax incidence, particularly in the context of green technologies. Exceptions include Borenstein and
Davis (2016) (distributional equity of clean energy tax credits), Kirwan (2009) (agricultural subsidies) as well as West
(2004), Beresteanu and Li (2011), and Sallee (2011) (vehicle subsidies).
8
Busse et al. (2006), Sallee (2011), Busse et al. (2012), Kaul et al. (2016), and Gulati et al. (2017) estimate
pass-through in automobile markets but do not allow for heterogeneous pass-through between buyers and lessees.
On the other hand, pass-through has been estimated for those who lease properties and land in the housing and
agricultural sectors. Kirwan (2009) examines how renters of farmland capture agricultural subsidies. Nafari (2017)
studies residential property tax incidence in owner-occupied and renter-occupied contexts. None of these papers find
over-shifting.

Due to Jenkin (1872), in a competitive market, the pass-through of a tax or subsidy to the
prices consumers face is

ρ=

,
1 + εεDS

where εD ≡ −(D0 p/q) is the elasticity of demand, εS ≡ S 0 p/q is the elasticity of supply and q is
quantity.
Equation 1 is the classic result demonstrating how pass-through in perfectly competitive markets
is bounded between 0 and 100 percent and determined entirely by the relative elasticity of supply
and demand. Complete pass-through occurs when either demand is perfectly inelastic or supply is
perfectly elastic and zero pass-through occurs when demand is perfectly elastic. In other words,
the more inelastic side of the market bears the greater burden of the tax or reaps the larger benefit
of the subsidy.

2.1

Pass-Through in the Presence of Market Power

We next consider the case of a monopoly. We assume that the monopolist’s profit function is concave
in quantity and that the cost, c(q), and demand functions are smooth. Revenues are p(q)q and from
this we can find marginal revenues as mr(q) = p(q) + p0 (q)q and marginal cost as mc(q) = c0 (q). A
per-unit tax on producers uniformly raises marginal cost by t, or analogously, a per-unit subsidy
on producers uniformly reduces marginal cost by s. As first shown in Bulow and Pfleiderer (1983)
and Seade (1985), and more recently in Weyl and Fabinger (2013), pass-through under monopoly
can be calculated by solving the monopolist’s optimization problem and then finding the rate at
which price changes with marginal cost. The monopolist maximizes profits by choosing quantity
such that mr(q) = mc(q) + t, and we detail in Appendix A that pass-through can be shown to
equal

where ms = −p0 q, the marginal consumer surplus, is what consumers earn when quantity expands, and εms = ms/ms0 q is the elasticity of the inverse marginal surplus function. This extra
component—as we explain below—measures the curvature of the logarithm of demand.
There are two changes from the pass-through formula under perfect competition (Equation 1).
First, εD − 1 has replaced εD , however this does not introduce any new determinants of passthrough.9 Second, more importantly, there is the new term containing the inverse elasticity of

marginal surplus. This is the key distinctive factor when considering pass-through for a monopolist
relative to the case of perfect competition. It is essentially a “convexity parameter” that measures
the curvature of (the logarithm of) demand. Weyl and Fabinger (2013) discuss this more extensively,
but we can see this using marginal surplus ms = −p0 q:

From Equation 4 it follows immediately that demand is logarithmically concave (or log-concave)
when 1/εms > 0 and logarithmically convex when 1/εms < 0. Since the logarithm is a concave
function, log-convex demand implies that the original demand function is highly convex (often
referred to as superconvex). Hence, all log-convex functions are convex, but not vice versa. One
familiar form of log-convex demand is isoelastic demand such as the case of constant elasticity
where εms = −ε. Another useful threshold to bear in mind is that if demand is concave, then
1/εms > 1, and if it is convex, then 1/εms < 1. We show this in Appendix A.
This demonstrates how pass-through under monopoly does not just depend on the relative
elasticities of supply and demand but also on other parameters that define the shape of the demand
curve, specifically on whether demand is concave, convex, or very convex.10 If we assume constant
marginal costs and consider the case of linear demand (i.e., 1/εms = 1), we can see that Equation
2 reduces to one-half since the component containing elasticity of supply drops out (because the
elasticity of supply is infinite). When demand is concave and 1/εms > 1, pass-through decreases
so that it is between 0 and 50 percent. Alternatively, when demand is convex and 1/εms < 1,
pass-through increases so that it is more than 50 percent, and it can exceed 100 percent if demand
is “convex enough”. More specifically, under linear costs, pass-through exceeds unity if and only if
1/εms < 0 (i.e., when demand is log-convex).
Figure 1 illustrates pass-through for a monopoly with constant marginal costs facing log-convex
demand and thus ρ > 1. We also show cases where over-shifting cannot occur in Appendix Figure
C.1. Panel A represents the case of perfect competition, where pass-through is strictly between 0
and 100 percent despite very convex demand. Panel B represents the case of monopoly but with
linear demand, where pass-through is always exactly 50 percent.
The threshold requirement of 1/εms < 0, or simply εms < 0, for pass-through to exceed unity
generalizes to other common models of imperfect competition. As shown in Weyl and Fabinger
10

Bulow and Pfleiderer (1983) and Seade (1985) first emphasized the connection between the elasticity of marginal
surplus and demand curvature. See also Katz and Rosen (1985), Stern (1987), and Delipalla and Keen (1992)
for additional early theory on over-shifting when demand is sufficiently convex in single-product oligopoly models.
Anderson et al. (2001) show that this is also true in an oligopoly with differentiated goods.

where θ is a conduct parameter ranging between zero for perfect competition and one for a pure
monopoly. For many standard models of imperfect competition like Cournot, θ is invariant to
changes in q, and thus the term θ/εθ is absent because 1/εθ = 0. As such, analogous to the case
of the monopoly, pass-through exceeds unity if and only if εms is negative (with constant marginal
costs).11

2.2

Over-Shifting as a Test for Market Power

The observation that pass-through can exceed unity is not new. Economists have long understood
that over-shifting occurs under many familiar models of imperfect competition when demand is
sufficiently convex. However, as we discuss in Section 5, there are other—albeit unlikely—conditions
under which pass-through can exceed unity. To the extent that these alternative explanations can
11
The acceptable range of values for εms also should be checked against the second order and stability conditions for
the problem to ensure consistency with stable symmetric market equilibrium. We detail these conditions in Appendix
A. They imply stricter conditions than εms < 0 in order to obtain over-shifting.

9

be carefully ruled out, however, over-shifting implies the existence of market power.12 This result
has not explicitly appeared in the literature, to our knowledge.
This suggests that estimating pass-through and finding that it over-shifts is an under-utilized
test for detecting market power. While more detailed structural modeling can provide important
information about market structure, the degree of market power, markups, and the deadweight
loss from imperfect competition, such an analysis typically imposes large time, data, and resource
demands. Alternatively, estimating pass-through of even industry-wide input costs—such as taxes
and subsidies—to prices in a partial equilibrium setting, which is often relatively straightforward,
can serve as a useful first diagnostic market power test.

Institutional Background and Data

3.1

The California Solar Initiative

The empirical context examined in this paper is solar energy subsidies, a highly prevalent policy
tool used to promote clean energy technologies. We study how they are passed through to the solar
system prices consumers face in the context of the California Solar Initiative (CSI). In an ideal
experiment, we would consider a market characterized by similar installers that offer similar prices
to a homogeneous group of potential solar adopters on systems with identical characteristics (size,
performance, solar output, design, etc.). We would then randomly vary rebate amounts across
consumer groups. Unsurprisingly, actual solar subsidies are not implemented in this way. However,
the CSI program design provides unique and exogenous time and cross-sectional variation that
allows us to use sudden changes in subsidy levels to identify pass-through with some additional
assumptions.
The CSI program took effect on January 1, 2007 with a 10-year planned budget of $2.167 billion
(although the program was mostly exhausted by mid-2013) and was available to the customers of
California’s three major Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs): San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E),
Southern California Edison (SCE), and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). The IOUs cover
the vast majority of California’s ratepayers, making the CSI program representative of California’s
solar market. Rebate levels started at $2.50 per watt and “stepped down” over ten pre-determined
rates based upon cumulative installed capacity in each IOU service region, declining to $0.20 per
watt over the program lifetime (Figure 2, panel A). This introduced sharp changes in rebate levels
(or the per watt value of the subsidy). Figure 2 (panel B) illustrates the CSI rebate level over time
and across utilities from 2010 through Q2 2013. Note that the rebate steps change at different
times for each IOU.13
Figure 2 conveys the essence of our estimation strategy outlined in Section 4. The sharp changes
in rebate levels across IOUs and over time provide us with useful price variation, even when we
12

Pass-through will not always exceed unity when there exists market power (e.g., demand must be sufficiently
convex), so finding that pass-through is less than 100 percent does not imply the absence of market power.
13
The timing of subsidy steps depends on solar adoption rates and can vary by utility. PG&E and SDG&E exhibit
a very similar pattern. SCE was initially lagging behind but almost caught up with the other two utilities by 2013.

Host- versus Third-Party Owned Systems and Market Power

Residential solar customers in California choose to use either HO or TPO, which is analogous to
buying versus leasing a consumer product in other markets. This choice has direct implications for
solar subsidies, which are nominally directed to the system owner. In the case of HO, residential
homeowners own the solar system and all output that it generates over its lifetime. On the other
hand, under the TPO model, homeowners sign a lease or power purchase agreement (PPA) with
a third-party solar company who then owns the system. In other words, subsidies are directed to
homeowners for the case of HO and to solar companies for the case of TPO.
The TPO model for solar was first introduced for residential customers in California in 2007, and
it quickly became popular—by 2012, over 70 percent of new systems in the state were installed using
TPO options (Figure 3). Under typical TPO contracts, consumers immediately reap the benefits
of installing solar (i.e., electricity bill savings) and avoid taking on debt. Third-party financiers
secure investor capital and tax equity to purchase solar systems on behalf of residential homeowners
who then lease the systems while incurring little or no upfront cost. The TPO providers also offer
additional services such as system monitoring and operations and maintenance over the lease term.
At the end of the lease term, homeowners typically have the option to purchase the system at fair
market value, renew the lease, or remove the system at no extra cost.
Initially, TPO market traction was largely driven by SolarCity, a firm that offered vertically
integrated installation and leasing services. Soon afterwards, competitors like Sunrun began offering TPO contracts as well. Various mergers have taken place over time between financing and
installation companies (e.g., Sunrun and REC Solar in 2014), leading to an increasing number of
vertically integrated firms that have large market shares, including some of the biggest players

for TPO like SolarCity and Vivint (McIntosh and Mandel 2014). As such, although the industry
has seen market entrants over time and many companies offer TPO options, the TPO market is
mostly dominated by just a few large firms. On the other hand, there are many small independent
installers that offer HO system sales and services.14

3.3

Solar Subsidy and System Data

We collect solar system-level data from the CSI database, which includes the total amount of rebate
received by residential solar adopters. These data also include system characteristics such as size,
location, module type, module manufacturer, module model, number of inverters, and installer.
This provides us with a rich set of controls. We include additional controls by matching our
system-level data to census tract-level demographic data. Details are provided in Appendix B.1.
We include only residential systems in our sample and define the rebate date as the “first
reservation request review date”, since rebate amounts are determined when the rebate reservation
is made as opposed to when the project is completed. Following Hughes and Podolefsky (2015), we
view the reservation date as the best approximation of the customer’s decision timing. We begin
our sample in 2010 due to TPO contract data availability and we end our sample at the end of Q2
2013. This is when subsidy rates had become very low (or exhausted) across IOUs.
The total CSI rebate amounts listed in the database are determined by the rebate rates that
14

The public CSI data that we use in our study suggest that the top 5 TPO companies were responsible for about
56 percent of TPO installations from 2010 through Q2 2013. In contrast, the top 5 HO companies were responsible
for just 17 percent of HO installations.

12

existed at the time the customer made a reservation through their IOU as well as the system and
geographical characteristics that contribute to expected system performance. The rebate application process requires submitting information on system characteristics that determine performance,
such as module type, inverter type, system size, installation location, site shading, system orientation, etc. These characteristics determine the system’s “design factor”, or the expected electrical
output of the solar system relative to a reference system. The design factor is multiplied by the
rebate rate to find the total subsidy amount. This amount is reported back to the customer, and
once the system is connected to the grid, the solar system owner receives a check for the total
subsidy amount. We describe a few other steps we took to prepare the data in Appendix B.1.

3.4

System Price Data

The effective price of a solar system to a consumer reflects government incentives. These are either
factored into the transaction price paid to the installer if the company receives the subsidy, or
alternatively, the consumer receives a rebate directly from the government that should be subtracted
from the transaction price. Under TPO, contractors negotiate contract terms based upon the rebate
they receive and presumably pass through subsidies to consumers to some degree in the form of
more favorable contract terms.
The price measure used in this paper, post-incentive price, is the transaction price inclusive of
cash rebates and other incentives. Our primary challenge is in obtaining an equivalently measured
post-incentive price for TPO and HO systems. The CSI dataset includes “total reported cost”
before incentives. This is considered a reliable measure for HO systems, so the post-incentive
price for HO consumers is simply the reported total cost minus incentives. These include the CSI
incentive amount as well as a pre-existing federal incentive, the federal investment tax credit (ITC),
which provides a 30 percent tax credit to all solar PV system owners.
We do not observe the actual ITC for each consumer. To overcome this, we derive the implied
ITC by assuming that it is fully monetized.15 For an HO system, the CSI rebate is considered a
price reduction for tax credit purposes. Thus, the ITC applies to the after-rebate net price paid by
the customer, calculated as

(6)

IT CHO,i = 0.3 ∗ (T CHO,i − CSIHO,i ),

where IT CHO,i is the federal ITC received by HO consumer i, T CHO,i is the total pre-incentive
system cost reported in CSI, and CSIHO,i is the total CSI rebate amount received. The postincentive price for HO consumers is then the total reported cost minus CSI and ITC.
15

It is possible that the cost of the system reported to the CSI is not the cost reported on tax forms for ITC
purposes. Furthermore, the credit is non-refundable and cannot be carried forward beyond 2016. As such, the
customer must have enough tax liability to absorb the credit. Our calculation follows Borenstein (2017) and assumes
that the ITC is fully monetized. This likely overstates its value somewhat (Borenstein 2017). However, the ability
to monetize the ITC does not affect pass-through for HO because post-incentive prices and the effective CSI rebate
both scale with 1 minus the effective ITC rate. See Appendix B.2 for details.

13

Importantly, the total costs in the CSI database for TPO systems are reported inconsistently.
It has been widely recognized that any analyses of CSI data that use reported costs as a proxy
for fair market value of TPO systems are “fundamentally flawed” (Greentech Media 2013). They
are installer-reported appraised values of the system as opposed to the actual prices consumers
pay. Deriving a post-incentive price faced by TPO consumers requires information on the actual
TPO contract terms agreed upon between customers and third parties. As such, we construct
the post-incentive price for TPO consumers by calculating the (subsidy-inclusive) net present cost
(NPC) based upon actual contract terms. This requires data on monthly lease payments or power
purchase agreement (PPA) rates, estimated solar production (for PPAs), contract term length,
upfront payments, and the annual escalation rate.
We obtained a non-disclosure agreement with the California Public Utilities Commission to
gain access to residential TPO contracts signed during 2010-2013. We sampled about 2,000 of
the contracts following a stratified sampling strategy described in Appendix B.1. We manually
transcribed this set of contracts to build a unique database of TPO contract terms. This provided
us with the relevant information needed to calculate the NPC of each contract based upon a
standard discounted cash flow methodology. We assume a 7 percent discount rate as a baseline
(see Section 4.3 for sensitivity analysis around this assumption), and calculate the NPC as follows:

(7)

N P Ci = Ui +

t
X
paymentiy
y=1

(1 + d)y

,

where Ui is the upfront payment for system i, paymentiy is the total annual payment in year y, d
is the discount rate, and t is the number of years on the contract term.
For leases, annual payments are derived from monthly payment amounts and escalation rates.
For PPAs, annual payments are calculated based upon the PPA rate as well as estimated year
one production (also provided in the contract) and assuming a 0.5 percent annual output degradation rate over the contract term length (following Jordan and Kurtz (2013)).16 For prepaid
TPO systems—the case where a TPO agreement was signed but the consumer pays for all monthly
payments upfront—the NPC is simply the amount paid upfront.
Like HO consumers, TPO installers were eligible for other existing incentives as well; TPO
installers can take advantage of an accelerated depreciation scheme, the Modified Accelerated Cost
Recovery System (MACRS), in addition to the ITC. However, there is no need to net out such
incentives from the NPC in order to obtain a post-incentive price as we do in the case of HO
systems, because the TPO installers receive all subsidies directly and these are embedded in the
final contract price offered to consumers. In other words, the NPC for TPO consumers is already
a post-incentive price.
Figure 4 illustrates how post-incentive prices evolved in the California solar market, both for

HO and TPO consumers. They decline gradually, but more so for HO than for TPO. Given
the simultaneously declining path of CSI rebates, pre-incentive prices decrease more rapidly. The
difference in time trend for HO versus TPO is one indication that these markets are different and
further motivates why we allow pass-through and time trends to vary across contract types.

Table 1 presents summary statistics of our data from 2010 through Q2 2013, including the CSI
rebate amounts, post-incentive prices, other system characteristics, and demographics. In general,
differences for HO and TPO systems are statistically significant but they are relatively modest in
terms of their economic magnitudes. Post-incentive prices and CSI rebates tend to be somewhat
lower for TPO consumers, which is consistent with HO systems being more prevalent in the early
years of our sample when prices and rebates were higher. There are no demographic differences that
stand out; the similar (and high) median household incomes for both types of customers suggest
that they are similar populations.

Empirical Pass-Through Results
Econometric Framework

To understand how solar subsidies are passed through to consumers, we estimate the effect of the
CSI rebate on post-incentive system prices using the following linear specification that allows for
heterogeneous effects between TPO and HO consumers:
(8) pi = α + β1 rebatei + β2 rebatei ∗ T P Oi + β3 T P Oi + Xi φ + γj + δk + ϕu + ωz + λc + µt + εi ,
where pi is the post-incentive price ($/watt) of system i (henceforth “price”), rebatei is the CSI

fixed effects, δk are county fixed effects, ϕu are IOU territory (utility) fixed effects, ωz are module
model fixed effects, λc are installer fixed effects, µt are contract type specific weekly quadratic time
trends, and εi is an error term.
Importantly, we adjust the CSI rebate to correct for its interaction with pre-existing federal
incentives (ITC and MACRS) for which solar customers were eligible throughout the sample period.
These subsidies mechanically reduce the value of the CSI rebate amount. For example, for HO
systems, the ITC is calculated as 30 percent of the after-rebate net consumer price. Hence, a onedollar increase in the CSI rebate is effectively worth only 70 cents, because the extra CSI dollar
decreases the value of the ITC by 30 cents. We thus need to multiply the CSI rebate by a correction
factor of 0.7 in order to interpret our pass-through coefficient as the price impact of a full one-dollar
subsidy increase. More details, including a similar correction for TPO systems, can be found in
Appendix B.2. Other papers estimating solar subsidy pass-through have not addressed this issue.
We include a rich set of fixed effects to control for time-invariant mean differences in prices
across IOUs, counties, module models, module manufacturers, and installers. Controls include
census tract level demographic and housing characteristics. We also include a dummy if more than
one inverter is installed, since inverters are an important component of the cost of the system.
Our identification strategy uses smooth weekly quadratic time trends for each contract type
(HO, lease, PPA, or prepaid lease).17 These trends control for general pricing trends such as declining costs and technological progress. Intuitively, the main identifying variation that we leverage
comes from large and sudden jumps in CSI rebate levels—across utilities and over time—relative
to smooth price trends (see Figure 2, panel B).
Lastly, we account for consumer selection issues around rebate drop dates. Certain consumers
and installers may exhibit strategic timing behavior, as they attempt to apply for the CSI rebate before an anticipated rebate level drop. Although such dates could not be perfectly foreseen, Appendix
Figure C.2 shows that some degree of bunching in CSI applications was indeed present, consistent
with Hughes and Podolefsky (2015). See Appendix C.2 for more details. If consumers who strategically submit reservation requests differ systematically from those who do not, a comparison of
prices just before and after rebate level changes will be based on different types of consumers. For
instance, consumers who act strategically might be more price-elastic or better informed. We therefore exclude observations in time windows around the rebate level drop dates (though, reassuringly,
we find that our main conclusions hold up even without excluding any observations).18
17

Table 5 shows that a less flexible specification that allows time trends to vary only for HO vs. TPO yields very
similar results.
18
On a related note, one might think that the sharp rebate level changes lend naturally to a regression discontinuity
design. However, the possibility of economic agents influencing on which side of a threshold they end up complicates
the interpretation of a regression discontinuity estimation.

Main Results

Table 2 presents our main results, which measure the effect of a $1/watt rebate level increase for HO
and TPO consumers on post-incentive prices. In panel A, we show our main regression results for
varying sizes of the exclusion window to account for consumer selection around rebate drop dates
as discussed above. We exclude observations within a symmetric window of two weeks before and
after the rebate level drop dates for each IOU in column 2, which we label our baseline specification.
We also show the results when no observations are dropped (column 1) and when the size of the
exclusion window is increased (columns 3 and 4). In panel B, we show the pass-through coefficients
from separate regressions for HO and TPO.

Notes: Dependent variable is the post-incentive system price per watt. Data cover systems installed in California for consumers
who applied for the CSI rebate during the period 2010-Q2 2013. Controls include census tract level demographics and a dummy
if there is more than one inverter. A 7 percent discount rate is assumed for the net present cost and MACRS calculations.
Standard errors clustered by zip code. In Panel A, the p-value labeled “HO pass-through > −1” is the one-sided p-value of
H0 : β1 ≤ −1 vs. Ha : β1 > −1. p-value labeled “TPO pass-through < −1” is the one-sided p-value of H0 : β1 + β2 ≥ −1
vs. Ha : β1 + β2 < −1. In panel B, all tests are performed on the single coefficient on the incentive variable. Asterisks denote
*p <0.10, **p <0.05, ***p <0.01 for H0 : β = 0 vs. Ha : β 6= 0.

18

Throughout all specifications in panel A, we find that the difference in pass-through between
TPO and HO consumers is large and highly statistically significant. In our preferred baseline
specification (column 2), the pass-through rate is 78 percent for HO and 153 percent for TPO.19
When using other exclusion window sizes, pass-through for HO changes little relative to column 2
(75-77 percent compared to 78 percent). Using a one-sided test, we always reject that pass-through
is at least complete, which provides strong evidence for incomplete—but still high—pass-through
for HO (see row “p-value: HO pass-through > −1”). The estimates for TPO range from 143-197
percent compared to 153 percent. Pass-through for TPO is statistically and economically greater
than 100 percent, providing evidence of substantial pass-through over-shifting (see row “p-value:
TPO pass-through < −1”).20 The coefficient estimate on the TPO indicator captures time-invariant
factors that account for price differences between TPO and HO.
The pass-through estimates from separate regressions in panel B are similar in magnitude to
the pooled regression results in panel A, however the estimates for TPOs are somewhat noisier.
In our baseline specification, pass-through for TPOs is 133 percent (and not statistically greater
than 100 percent) when separated versus 153 percent (and statistically greater than 100 percent)
when pooled (see panel A). Note that TPO pass-through in panel B is statistically greater than
100 percent when widening the exclusion window in columns 3 and 4 (one-sided p-values are 0.038
and 0.039, respectively); from that perspective, our baseline specification is a conservative choice.
The conclusions from panels A and B are similar. We maintain the pooled regression specifications throughout the remainder of the paper—the benefit of efficiency from pooling the data is
appealing in this setting, especially given the somewhat limited sample of TPOs.
In summary, our main estimates show that pass-through for solar systems is strikingly high.
They also demonstrate significant over-shifting for TPO systems. We discuss and interpret these
findings in more detail in the following sections, but first we turn to showing the robustness of our
estimates.

4.3

Robustness Checks

One critical assumption of our identification strategy is that price trends are smooth over time
except for sudden changes in the CSI rebate. To be more confident that our results are not sensitive
to the degree of flexibility of the time trend, we estimate additional specifications with more and
less flexible contract type specific weekly time trends. We also add utility quadratic time trends
to account for the possibility that time-varying factors differ between utility regions. These results
are presented in Table 3.
19
Our estimate for HO systems is similar to pass-through rates found in other studies of HO markets, providing
additional confidence in our estimation strategy. Gillingham and Tsvetanov (2017) find a pass-through rate of 84
percent in Connecticut and Dong et al. (2016) find nearly 100 percent pass-through in California. Podolefsky (2013)
finds a very low pass-through rate for a different type of incentive (the solar ITC). None of these studies examine
TPO markets.
20
When clustering standard errors by county, TPO pass-through is still statistically greater than 100 percent: the
one-sided p-value of a test that there is no TPO pass-through overshifting is 0.016, only slightly higher than the
reported 0.013 in panel A, column 2.

We find that the magnitude and significance of our estimates are stable at different levels of
time trend flexibility (columns 1-5; baseline estimates in column 2). We also add a specification
in which weekly polynomial time trends are replaced with quarter by year fixed effects for each
contract type (column 6). This hardly affects our pass-through estimates. Adding utility quadratic
time trends to the baseline specification slightly increases pass-through. The final two rows indicate
that there is incomplete pass-through for HO for all but one specification; TPO pass-through is
always significantly above 100 percent.
We also test if our estimates are sensitive to the discount rate assumption used in the TPO
contract NPC calculations. We estimate pass-through assuming discount rates ranging from 2 to 12
percent. The pass-through estimates are stable across specifications (see Table 4; baseline estimates
in column 3). They are slightly higher when assuming a lower discount rate and slightly lower when
assuming a higher discount rate, but overall the discount rate affects pass-through only modestly.
As anticipated, however, the sign of the TPO dummy coefficient is sensitive to the discount rate
choice. As we are interested in pass-through, we do not need to take a strong stance on the correct
discount rate.

We perform a number of further robustness checks in Table 5. Column 1 shows that the
estimates are almost identical when we include time trends that differentiate between HO vs. TPO
only, rather than allowing separate trends for leases, PPAs and prepaid leases. In column 2, we
account for the possibility that there are solar panel manufacturer-specific time-varying factors that
affect pricing, for example for foreign-based vs. domestic manufacturers. The results show that our
results are robust to interacting manufacturer and contract type specific time trends.
We further explore robustness by using propensity score matching to compare differences in
pass-through between matched TPO and HO systems sold in similar markets. The propensity
score matching helps address the concern that the choice between HO and TPO is not as good as
randomly assigned relative to other determinants of prices.21 We match on the system and census
tract level demographic controls used above as well as the utility region. The results are similar
to the main estimates, with pass-through for HO slightly below 100 percent and over-shifting for
TPO (column 3). The degree of over-shifting for both HO and TPO is about 10 percent higher
than in our baseline specification.
It is possible that our pass-through estimates vary over time because HO installations are frontloaded to earlier years in our sample and market conditions can change over time. We therefore ran
a version of our regression in which we allow pass-through to vary in the first and second half of the
21
A related issue is that there might be household-specific unobservables that create a correlation between HO/TPO
and price. Propensity score matching can only partially alleviate this concern, although the results in Table 5 below
are reassuring.

sample period. Column 4 shows that our main conclusions hold for both time periods. TPO passthrough in the second period is somewhat lower. In columns 5 and 6, we check the robustness of
our results to the corporate tax rate assumption since smaller firms face somewhat lower corporate
tax rates. We vary the corporate tax rate assumption between 25 and 35 percent and find the
expected pattern of lower (higher) TPO pass-through under lower (higher) tax rate assumptions;
TPO pass-through still over-shifts even when assuming a tax rate of 25 percent, which we argue
is too low.22 Finally, we add electricity rates as controls, based on location and date at which
the household applied for the CSI rebate. Higher electricity prices increase electricity bill savings
realized from solar adoption and hence may affect solar panel prices.
Overall, the various sensitivity and robustness checks in Tables 3-5 show that our results are
stable across specifications in significance and magnitude.23 We consistently find pass-through
below 100 percent for HO and above 100 percent for TPO. This is reassuring and provides additional
confidence in our pass-through estimates. The high pass-through estimates also lead us to conclude
that—even as the burden of a subsidy drop (or the benefits of a subsidy increase) shifts from
consumers to firms as the market moves from perfect to imperfect competition—consumers likely
receive a large majority of the extra surplus when subsidies increase. Using the incidence bounds
in Ganapati et al. (2016), we calculate that the consumer share of the burden for TPO is bounded
between 60 and 153 percent as the market moves from monopoly to perfect competition; incidence
for HOs is bounded between 44 and 78 percent. Although consumers receive the majority of the
extra surplus from increased subsidies even under most forms of imperfect competition, total surplus
in such markets will be lower than in competitive markets, which ultimately hampers the speed of
solar adoption.

5

Alternative Explanations

In Section 2, we discuss how the presence of market power can theoretically explain over-shifting.
While there are several alternative explanations for more-than-complete pass-through besides imperfect competition, such conditions are uncommon in most markets and could be considered
special cases. We discuss them in this section and argue that they are also unlikely to occur in
solar markets. We also discuss how one phenomenon that is widely known to affect pass-through,
tax salience, cannot explain over-shifting in a competitive market.
Giffen Behavior.—Equation 1 demonstrates how Giffen behavior, εD < 0, could lead to over22

The marginal corporate tax rate in the U.S. differs by a firm’s taxable income and varies between 34-39 percent
for firms with taxable income above $75,000. Corporate tax rates are lower for firms with very low taxable income:
15 percent between $0-$50,000; 25 percent between $50,000-$75,000. As the leasing market is dominated by a couple
of large firms, our baseline assumption of 30 percent appears conservative, if anything. An average corporate tax rate
of 25 percent is almost certainly too low.
23
We also interacted HO vs. TPO pass-through with an indicator of market concentration, defined as “less” vs.
“more” competition based on the median Herfindahl-Hirschman Index at the zip code (or county) level. The results
are consistent with theory but lack statistical power: pass-through is higher in less competitive markets and this
effect is stronger for TPO than for HO. Results available on request.

shifting. However, Giffen goods are strongly inferior goods (i.e., goods in very high demand by
low-income consumers), while the household income among solar adopters strongly suggests that
solar systems are luxury goods (Table 1). Furthermore, empirical evidence of upward sloping demand is extremely sparse; the literature so far has found evidence exclusively in the developing
country context.24 For the U.S. residential solar market, empirical estimates of the price elasticity of solar systems show that solar markets are indeed characterized by the expected downward
sloping demand curves (e.g., Gillingham and Tsvetanov (2017)). Our own demand elasticities in
Section 6, while admittedly imprecise, confirm this finding. We conclude that Giffen behavior is
unreasonable for solar markets and indeed highly unlikely in most markets.
Salience.—We know that tax salience affects pass-through from Chetty et al. (2009). However,
we now show that salience cannot explain over-shifting under perfect competition. Chetty et
al. (2009) show that consumers underreact to taxes that are not salient.25 In their experiment,
consumers make purchasing decisions based on the pre-tax posted price, but they end up paying
a tax-inclusive price at the supermarket’s register. Analogously, consumers may underreact to
subsidies if they are not salient.
To investigate whether tax (or subsidy) salience can explain over-shifting, we first discuss how
imperfect salience affects pass-through. We follow Chetty et al. (2009)’s derivation of pass-through
that allows for salience effects (and other optimization errors) with respect to taxes and refer to
that paper for details. Let p̂ denote a good’s pre-tax price and assume t is a per-unit tax so that
the tax-inclusive price is p = p̂ + t. Z denotes wealth of the representative consumer. Under perfect
competition, the market-clearing price p̂ satisfies D(p̂, t, Z) = S(p̂) and implicit differentiation of
this yields the pass-through to consumers as

(9)

dp
dp̂
εS + (1 − η)εD
=1+
=
,
dt
dt
εS + εD

where η is the degree to which agents under-react to the tax t.26 When a tax or subsidy is perfectly
salient, or η = 1, Equation 9 is identical to the standard pass-through under perfect competition
(Equation 1). When η = 0 and the tax or subsidy is fully non-salient (i.e., consumers completely
ignore the tax or subsidy), a new positive term enters the numerator of the pass-through formula.
Hence, the pass-through of a tax increases as salience decreases. Since dp/dt = −dp/ds, the passthrough of a subsidy also increases with lower salience—consumers underreact to the subsidy and
their ex-post subsidy-inclusive price ends up being lower.
24

Until Jensen and Miller (2008)’s demand estimation for dietary staples among extremely poor households in
China, there were no well-identified empirical papers demonstrating the existence of markets with upward sloping
demand. To our knowledge, the existence of Giffen behavior has not been shown to exist in any other markets since,
either.
25
We follow Chetty et al. (2009) in using the term “tax salience” to refer to the visibility of the tax-inclusive price.
26
Chetty et al. (2009)’s original formulation multiplies the εS terms by p/p̂, however we follow most of the literature
in assuming small changes in the tax/subsidy for consistency with our main analysis in Section 2, and thus p/p̂ ≈ 1.

24

From Equation 9 it becomes clear that salience cannot explain over-shifting in a perfectly
competitive market; pass-through will be strictly bound between 0 and 100 percent for 0 ≤ η ≤ 1.27
As such, even under imperfect salience, over-shifting still implies imperfect competition.
Nonetheless, although limited salience cannot explain over-shifting, differences in the salience
of the CSI rebate between HO and TPO could provide one of many possible reasons why their
pass-through rates differ. We now argue that limited salience is unlikely to describe either solar
market in California. First, consider the case of TPO, where companies receive the CSI rebates, list
rebate amounts on customer TPO contracts, and then quote final contract terms so that consumers
see prices that fully embed the subsidies. This makes the tax-inclusive price in this market fully
salient to consumers. They are not surprised ex-post by a rebate check that they receive some time
after purchasing the solar system.
Next, consider the case for HO customers. In this market, the host owner receives the rebate
check directly (ex-post) in some cases; in other cases the company receives it and then quotes a
subsidy-inclusive price (as well as the subsidy amount) to the customer. In the first case, consumers
pay pre-subsidy prices. In the second case, consumers pay subsidy-inclusive prices, analogous to
the case for TPO consumers. It is the first type of HO transactions in which CSI subsidies could
be less than fully salient.28 However, as the rebate amount is always reported to the consumer at
the time of purchase, the calculation method is transparent and easily verifiable, and the subsidy is
large, it would be highly surprising if not all buyers and installers were aware of it. Thus, imperfect
salience of CSI rebates is highly unlikely in both HO and TPO markets.
Another form of imperfect salience can arise from interactions between different subsidies. For
example, regardless of whether the federal investment tax credit (ITC) and the CSI rebates themselves are salient to solar buyers, their interaction may not be (see Section 4). This issue does
not apply to TPO; firms are certainly aware of the ITC and its interactions with the CSI, and
consumers face fully salient, subsidy-inclusive prices. An HO customer, however, may overestimate
the value of the CSI rebate; being unaware that the higher CSI rebate reduces the ITC amount,
she may be unpleasantly surprised ex-post when learning from her tax return that the ITC is lower
than expected. In terms of the discussion above, this is a case where the consumer would overreact
to the CSI subsidy—the lack of salience of the subsidy interaction means that the subsidy itself is
“too salient”, so η > 1 in Equation 9. As discussed in footnote 27, this reduces pass-through for HO
and implies that if the interaction were more salient to HO customers, pass-through would increase.
Subsidy Manipulation.—Another factor that can explain differences in pass-through rates is a
27

Although η < 1 for most commodity taxes, η > 1 can occur if consumers overestimate tax or subsidy rates, as
appears to occur for opaque estate tax systems (Slemrod 2006). However, this case of the tax or subsidy being “super
salient” would decrease pass-through even more to some amount less than pass-through under full optimization.
Furthermore, η < 0 would imply that consumers implicitly count on a tax actually being a subsidy, which we rule
out as unreasonable.
28
However, if subsidy-inclusive prices are indeed less salient for HO consumers than for TPO consumers, we would
expect higher pass-through for HO systems. This is the opposite direction from what we find empirically in Section
4.

25

differential ability of firms to evade taxes. We use Kopczuk et al. (2016)’s framework to argue that,
in theory, over-shifting can occur in markets with a high degree of unobserved tax evasion. Analogously, subsidy over-shifting can also happen when companies are able to substantially manipulate
or exaggerate the variables that determine the total subsidy so that they receive higher payments
than the official subsidy amount observed by the econometrician. While we argue in this section
that subsidy manipulation is nearly impossible in the context of the CSI rebate,29 we begin by
discussing how it could theoretically explain pass-through that exceeds unity.
We consider the case of perfect competition and a per-unit tax t (or a per-unit subsidy s)
that is remitted by suppliers. The standard statutory incidence irrelevance result states that a tax
levied on the demand side would leave pass-through and incidence unaffected. However, Kopczuk
et al. (2016) show that allowing for differences in the ability to evade taxes between consumers and
firms alters this well-known result. Pass-through then depends on remittance responsibility and
the degree of tax evasion. Differentiating the equilibrium condition D(p) = S(p − t) with respect
to the tax rate yields the following pass-through expression for consumers:

(10)

dp
εS
εN E[e|t]
=
−
,
dt
εS + εD
εS + εD q

where q is total output, e is the total amount of tax evasion, εN is the price elasticity of the number
of firms in equilibrium, and other variables are as previously defined.
We refer to Kopczuk et al. (2013) for the derivation but demonstrate here that their result
implies the possibility of over-shifting. First, note that if there is no tax evasion (e = 0), the
pass-through expression is identical to Equation 1. Next, when there is evasion (e > 0), there is
a negative adjustment term applied to the standard pass-through expression. In other words, the
tax-inclusive consumer price increases by less when firms (or consumers) can evade taxes. This is
intuitive: firms and consumers together remit fewer taxes to the government than the official tax
rate would suggest. This mitigates price changes. As econometricians, we interpret this as lower
pass-through to consumers, even though firms end up paying lower taxes, too.30
The case of unobserved subsidy manipulation differs slightly. First, dp/ds = −dp/dt. Second,
subsidy exaggeration in Kopczuk et al. (2016)’s setting goes in the opposite direction from tax evasion e (i.e., e is negative, as exaggeration is “negative evasion”): higher subsidies lead to more rents
from manipulation, part of which benefits consumers in the form of lower subsidy-inclusive prices.
Taken together, the effect of subsidy manipulation on dp/ds is negative—the same official subsidy
leads to a larger decrease in subsidy-inclusive consumer prices in the presence of manipulation. In
29

Subsidy manipulation (or tax evasion) is conceivable in other markets or with other subsidies. For instance, in
the U.S. solar market, there were allegations that the investment tax credit was subject to manipulation. We discuss
below that this does not affect our pass-through estimates.
30
Our analysis assumes that the firm has full remittance responsibility. However, if firms or consumers have
differential abilities to evade taxes, the evasion effect on pass-through is larger when the remittance responsibility of
the tax is shifted towards the side of the market with better abilities to evade. See Kopczuk et al. (2016) for a full
treatment of this intuitive result.

26

our regression framework, we would interpret that as higher pass-through. Intuitively, there is more
subsidy money to be distributed between consumer and firm, which benefits consumers (“higher
pass-through”) even if the firm captures most of the manipulated subsidy increase.
Importantly, Equation 10 does not prevent the pass-through coefficient of the manipulated
subsidy from exceeding 100 percent. In fact, if subsidy pass-through was close to 100 percent in a
market without manipulation, even a modest amount of subsidy exaggeration could lead to overshifting. Note that this issue only arises if the actual (manipulated) subsidy received is unobserved
and the econometrician only knows the statutory subsidy amount. If firms manipulate subsidies but
we observe what they actually receive, the usual pass-through results from Section 2 apply and the
subsidy exaggeration cannot explain over-shifting. We thus conclude that subsidy manipulation,
if unobserved, increases estimated pass-through coefficients and can move them above 100 percent
under special circumstances.
Although this sheds light on another potential explanation for over-shifting, the CSI rebate is
almost certainly not subject to unobserved subsidy manipulation, ruling out this potential explanation for our over-shifting finding. The rebate amount is not determined based upon reported
prices or imputed values but rather by the effective (i.e., location- and system-adjusted) system size.
Manipulating such system features, which are transparent and easily verified through inspection,
is extremely difficult or even impossible.31
For completeness, we mention that recent stories in the media report that third-party solar leasing and installation firms manipulated a different solar subsidy: the ITC (Greentech Media 2013).
The ITC is 30 percent of the estimated value of solar systems, which some firms have allegedly
inflated in order to reap larger ITCs. This manipulation was only possible for TPO systems, as
there is no arm’s length transaction price between the installer and the new owner (the leasing
department of the same integrated company). For HO systems, the ITC was calculated based on
the actual transaction price between the homeowner and the installation company, which is much
harder to manipulate. These practices do not affect our estimates as we study the pass-through of
CSI (not ITC) subsidies.32
Decreasing Marginal Costs.—Standard short-run analyses assume diminishing returns to inputs,
or in other words, increasing marginal costs of production, and thus the supply elasticity εS > 0. It
follows immediately from Equation 1 that pass-through cannot exceed unity under this assumption
in perfectly competitive markets (barring Giffen behavior). Nonetheless, over-shifting theoretically
can occur if εS < 0. However, this could only happen in industries with such strong returns to scale
that the marginal cost function is decreasing in the short run. Also note that increasing returns to
inputs often leads to an unstable equilibrium that requires government intervention (e.g., natural
31

Furthermore, such manipulation would have been a very high-risk endeavor considering a proportion of projects
were inspected to ensure accurate reporting, and thus the program was administered in a way that safeguarded
against such behavior. An official administering the CSI program confirmed this.
32
In addition, the value of the CSI rebate is independent of whether or not companies manipulated the ITC. As
discussed in Appendix B.2, an extra dollar of CSI rebates reduces the value of the total ITC received by $0.30,
regardless of whether the ITC amount was overstated or not.

27

monopoly).
Decreasing marginal costs are highly uncommon in general and are certainly not observed in the
California solar market in the short run. Consideration of the TPO market’s cost structure strongly
suggests non-declining short-run marginal costs. The majority of the solar system cost is driven by
“soft” costs such as labor, inventory and marketing. The TPO market is already characterized by a
few dominant firms that employ sophisticated methods to take advantage of their scale in reducing
such costs. Although one can imagine longer-run scale advantages from more efficient installation
procedures or customer acquisition for small firms, it is difficult to imagine how increasing returns
to labor and other installation cost inputs would have occurred in the short run for mature firms.
We are only aware of two empirical examples of markets with decreasing marginal costs: brick
production (Bower 1964) and health insurance when adverse selection is present (Einav et al. 2010).
It should be to no surprise that empirical evidence for decreasing short-run marginal costs is scant.
The traditional micro model of a firm says that firms have increasing short-run marginal costs,
based on the idea that in the short run there are fixed inputs and that variable inputs exhibit
decreasing marginal products; in the long run, all factors can be changed. Of course, many industries with high fixed costs exhibit increasing marginal costs but decreasing average costs. The
only models—as far as we know—that assumes decreasing short-run marginal costs are models of
adverse selection.
Nominal Pricing Rigidities.—Conlon and Rao (2016) demonstrate that nominal rigidities in
prices can rationalize pass-through over-shifting regardless of the shape of the underlying demand
curve. While price changes that occur in coarse increments exist in specific contexts, such as in
their empirical setting of distilled spirits markets, this is not the case in many markets and certainly
not for solar systems.

6

Demand Curvature and Over-Shifting

Our empirical estimates in Section 4 show that the pass-through rate of solar subsidies in the residential sector has been high, with baseline pass-through for HO of 78 and 153 percent—substantially
above 100 percent—for TPO. In Section 2, we discuss that such over-shifting is theoretically possible under imperfect competition when demand is sufficiently convex and indeed observed in various
markets.
We now connect the theory of over-shifting—as elegantly laid out by Weyl and Fabinger (2013)—
with our solar market data. We aim to test if our data support a demand specification that is
consistent with the over-shifting observed in the California solar market. In other words, we need
to investigate if demand for residential solar systems is sufficiently convex to explain pass-through
above unity in an imperfectly competitive market. To do this, we construct an empirical test of the
over-shifting theory. While this may seem to be a natural subsequent inquiry in an empirical paper
that finds more-than-complete pass-through, earlier papers that estimate pass-through rates have

28

not explicitly connected the theory of pass-through under imperfect competition with an empirical
test of demand convexity.
We begin by estimating demand for solar systems in the HO and TPO markets separately. In
doing so, it is of crucial importance to specify a flexible enough demand function that allows for
concave, convex or very convex demand. We therefore take the approach of estimating quadratic
demand specifications for HO and TPO systems, computing the range of prices (if any) over which
Seade (1985) and Weyl and Fabinger (2013) would predict over-shifting, both for HO and TPO,
and testing whether our pass-through estimates are consistent with these price ranges.
As it turns out, this analysis is complicated by the fact that the relevant convexity parameter
εms from the pass-through theory (defined below Equation 2)—and therefore the range of prices
over which one would expect over-shifting in a market characterized by imperfect competition—
is sensitive to the parameters of a flexibly estimated demand specification. Therefore, the main
contribution of this exercise is not to provide precise price ranges over which over-shifting occurs
in the solar markets studied here but rather to illustrate how the theory of over-shifting can be
empirically tested with a standard demand estimation. We provide—to the best of our knowledge—
the first empirical test of consistency between over-shifting and demand curvature. As such, we
show that empiricists can directly test pass-through theory to lend additional credibility to empirical
estimates of pass-through rates that exceed 100 percent by taking demand curvature seriously.
The power of this demand curvature test to support over-shifting depends on the availability of
sufficiently rich data. We cannot emphasize enough, however, that our demand estimates are noisy,
so our conclusions about the exact price range over which we predict over-shifting under imperfect
competition need to remain modest. We consider the analysis below to be a compromise between
a full-fledged test based on a complete and precise demand estimation and an extensive numerical
example. Nonetheless, the exercise illustrates the mechanics of how one could implement such a
test when sufficiently rich data is available.

6.1.1

Demand Estimation
Econometric Framework

We estimate a demand equation that flexibly allows for different degrees of convexity or concavity.
We choose the simplest form: demand for solar systems as a quadratic function of their prices.
The coefficient on the squared price term directly measures convexity. The usual simultaneity bias
justifies an instrumental variables estimator. We estimate the following equation by 2SLS with
data aggregated at the zip code by year level:

(11)

qit = β1 pit + β2 p2it + Xit θ + δj + τt + εit ,

where i indicates zip code and t denotes year. The dependent variable qit is the installation rate
defined as the number of residential solar systems installed in a particular zip code and year per
29

1,000 inhabitants. We normalize by population given the vast differences in population across zip
codes in California. On the right-hand side, pit is the post-incentive price per watt, δj are county
fixed effects, τt are year fixed effects, and εit is an error term. Xit includes the same demographic
controls that we use in the pass-through regressions in Section 4 as well as electricity rates.
Although our model includes year fixed effects, electricity rates—which affect demand for solar
because higher electricity prices increase electricity bill savings realized from solar adoption—change
within year. Electricity prices in California follow a tiered rate structure, where electricity rates
increase with household consumption. We follow Hughes and Podolefsky (2015) and include each
IOU’s rates for the three highest tiers.
We identify our demand parameters based on zip code and time variation in the solar installation
rate and price after controlling for observables and instrumenting for the price. We instrument for
pit and p2it using a set of supply shifters. We follow Gillingham and Tsvetanov (2017) in using the
rebate and its square (in dollars per Watt; as defined and used in the pass-through regressions from
Section 4) as well as the county-level electrician/wiring wage rate and its square. The latter is a
proxy for solar installer wages.
Both CSI rebates and wages are credible instruments. Electricians’ wages act as an exogenous
cost shifter which plausibly affects demand only through its effect on the price of the solar system.
The sharp variation in rebate levels from the step changes described in Section 3.1 provides a
source of exogenous solar panel cost variation. As firms earn such rebates, their supply curve shifts
downwards by the incentive amount. Hence, rebates can be used as cost shifters that can aid in
identifying demand.33
Any instrumental variables estimator assumes an exclusion restriction—ours is that any omitted
variables that end up in the error term are uncorrelated with our instruments (rebates and wages).
The inclusion of year and county fixed effects flexibly account for time trends in installation rates
that are common across counties, as well as time-invariant differences across counties. These absorb
some complications from swings in macroeconomic conditions during our sample period. However,
the CSI program might have had general equilibrium effects on electricians’ wages through increased
demand for electricians. Also, there might be omitted demand shifters, such as changes in tastes
for the visual aspects of solar panels or preferences towards being less reliant on the incumbent
utility company, that exhibit different trends in different zip codes. Such omitted variables could
introduce bias insofar as they correlate with our instruments. Through the exclusion restriction,
we maintain the assumption that the impact of such variables is negligible.
6.1.2

Data

The underlying dataset is the same as in the pass-through analysis (see Section 4 for details), except
that we add to each installation the corresponding tiered electricity rates (based on location and

This description applies directly to the TPO market, where firms receive the CSI rebates. In the HO market, the
rebates are sometimes paid to the firm. In other cases, they are paid to the consumer. In our setting where we model
post-incentive prices for consumers, and assuming the standard statutory incidence irrelevance result, the latter case
is analogous to the firm’s supply curve shifting down while the demand curve remains fixed.

date at which the household applied for the CSI rebate) and county-level data on electricity/wiring
wages from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, we keep all TPO installations, not
just those whose contracts have been transcribed. We then aggregate the data to create a balanced
panel. Statistical power forces us to trade off temporal and cross-sectional price variation, so
we follow others in the literature by using annual installations but small geographic regions due
to the likely heterogeneity across regions in environmental preferences and other characteristics
(Gillingham and Tsvetanov 2017). We aggregate to the zip code by year level, separately for
HO and TPO systems.34 This leaves some zip code-year observations with missing data for some
variables, mostly where there are zero installations in a given zip code-year or where there are
TPO installations but we do not have TPO contract prices (because our pricing data covers a
relatively limited fraction of TPO contracts). We interpolate missing data using observations from
surrounding areas, as described in Appendix B.1. The final dataset contains data on installations
rates, contract types, prices and control variables for 1,958 zip codes for each of the years 20102013. Our main specifications exclude zip codes with less than 100 inhabitants, as these are mostly
non-representative commercial districts or remote areas. See Appendix B.1 for more details on the
data for the demand regressions.
Appendix Table B.1 contains summary statistics of the data used for the demand estimations.
Demand rates for HO and TPO are not statistically different. Differences for HO and TPO rebates,
post-incentive prices, and system size are statistically different in some cases but relatively modest
in terms of economic magnitudes. There are no significant demographic differences that stand out.
6.1.3

Results

Table 6 shows the results of the demand estimation. We provide OLS results in columns 1 and
2 and IV estimates in columns 3 and 4. Across all specifications, we find that demand is convex,
as indicated by the positive coefficients on the squared price term. For both HO and TPO, the
IV estimates pass the weak instruments test (as indicated by the two Sanderson-Windmeijer Fstatistics), but they are imprecisely estimated, not statistically significant, and they differ from the
OLS estimates. Still, IV is the theoretically correct way to estimate demand. While acknowledging
the limitations from large standard errors, we continue to illustrate the implications of our estimated
demand parameters for over-shifting.
When translating the parameter estimates from the IV specifications in Table 6 to price elasticities, we find that, at the average price in our sample of $3.70 per watt, the demand elasticity is
-0.85 for HO and -0.42 for TPO.35 Demand becomes more elastic as prices decrease. The relative
inelasticity of demand for TPO versus HO systems suggests one reason why pass-through rates are
34
We caveat that aggregating data across geography and/or time masks responses to price changes within, e.g.,
years or zip codes—an issue that is common to many demand estimations.
35
Our estimates are generally in the same range as others in the literature. Gillingham and Tsvetanov (2017) find
a price elasticity of demand for solar PV systems of -1.76 in Connecticut. However, using California data, Hughes
and Podolefsky (2015) estimate a “rebate elasticity” of approximately -1.2, which is most usefully comparable to our
estimate for HO systems. No other studies have estimated elasticities for the TPO market.

Notes: Dependent variable is the solar system installation rate. Observations are at the zip code by year level for zip codes with
100 inhabitants or more. Data cover systems installed in California for consumers who applied for the CSI rebate during the
period 2010-Q2 2013. Controls includes the same demographics that we use in Table 2, as well as tiered electricity rates. A 7
percent discount rate is assumed for the net present cost and MACRS calculations. IV estimates in columns 3 and 4 instrument
for (squared) price using the (squared) CSI rebate and the (squared) county-level electrician/wiring wage rate. F-statistic is

higher for TPO, yet this alone cannot explain over-shifting.36
Appendix Table C.3 shows how the demand parameters vary with alternative sample selection
or variable construction rules. First, we define the solar installation rate based on the number
of people who live in houses they own instead of total population. Second, we include the lowpopulation zip codes. The estimates are similar to those in Table 6. Finally, we discuss the IV
results when only a subset of instruments is used. The IV estimates for HO are broadly similar to
those in Table 6, but the IV results for TPO are very noisy. We therefore prefer the estimates in
Table 6.

6.2

Implications for Over-Shifting

Theory predicts that, under monopoly and many other forms of imperfect competition, over-shifting
occurs when demand is sufficiently convex, i.e. 1/εms < 0, as summarized by Equation 5. Having
estimated separate demand functions for HO and TPO consumers, we now calculate 1/εms using
our estimated demand coefficients along different points of these demand curves (see Appendix C.3
for details).
Figure 5 shows the inverse demand curves for HO and TPO. The shaded areas indicate the
36

Note that our market demand elasticities at the average price of $3.70 are greater than -1. A firm with market
power will price on the elastic portion of its residual demand curve, which is more elastic than the market demand
curve. Hence, our inelastic market demand estimates do not contradict optimal pricing.

price range over which the demand curves are log-convex. The solid red line shows the mean price;
the dotted red lines indicate the “95 percent range” for prices. As the demand curve is a quadratic
in price, the inverse demand curve can bend backward for high prices if there are high-price and
high-installation areas. We can conclude from these graphs that there is a sizeable price range over
which demand is log-convex; for both HO and TPO. This provides suggestive evidence that the
solar market is indeed a candidate for over-shifting when market power is present, over at least
some range of prices that are reasonable for this market and time period.
As discussed above, we include this analysis to demonstrate how flexibly estimating demand can
help provide further evidence to support empirical estimates of over-shifting. While the curvature of
demand in the residential solar sector appears consistent with the possibility of over-shifting, we also
remind the reader that our demand equations are imprecisely estimated and the convexity ranges
are sensitive to demand parameters. Nonetheless, this procedure can be applied more broadly to
provide supporting evidence for empirical findings of over-shifting, which can in turn be used to
argue for the presence of market power if alternative explanations can be convincingly ruled out.

Conclusion

Pass-through is an important tool of economic analysis as it can reveal important characteristics
about supply, demand, or market power. In this paper, we demonstrate how an empirical finding of
pass-through over-shifting can serve as a simple test for the existence of market power. We estimate
pass-through in an important empirical setting: the market for solar systems in California under
the California Solar Initiative, the largest state solar rebate program to date in the United States.
We allow pass-through to differ between buyers and lessees of solar systems. We find that pass33

through is remarkably high in both markets and over-shifts for lessees. Pass-through to consumers
who purchase their solar panels is about 78 cents for every dollar increase in subsidies. For leases,
a $1 increase in subsidies translates to a decrease in solar system prices of $1.53. These estimates
do not support popular claims that solar companies appropriate most of the subsidies. However, at
the same time, we provide evidence that the TPO solar market is imperfectly competitive, which
implies that consumer surplus is lower than in a competitive market.
The substantial over-shifting in the leasing market can be explained by imperfect competition
combined with “sufficiently convex” demand, but there exist other conditions—including but not
limited to Giffen behavior, decreasing marginal costs, and unobserved subsidy manipulation—under
which over-shifting can occur. We formalize pass-through over-shifting as an under-utilized test
for market power by outlining and ruling out these alternative explanations. We conclude that,
in the setting of the California solar market, over-shifting can only be rationalized by imperfect
competition and sufficiently convex demand. We reinforce this conclusion with an empirical test
of demand curvature for solar systems, which indeed suggests sufficiently convex demand. While
this more-than-complete pass-through may seem surprising, over-shifting has been found in many
markets.
This paper is the first to estimate pass-through of green energy subsidies in a third-party market
and to contrast pass-through for buyers and lessees of (virtually) the same product. Our results
shed light on how the benefits of such subsidies accrue across different types of consumers and
firms, which should be of interest to policy makers. The substantial difference in pass-through is
not only interesting to highlight that HO and TPO systems cannot be treated as a single market for
solar panels, but also because it suggests that buy and lease markets could differ in other contexts,
such as automobiles, planes, and computers. Consequently, future research could focus on how tax
incidence differs across the buy and lease segments of such markets.
Most importantly, we argue that estimating pass-through and finding that it over-shifts can serve
as a powerful diagnostic for detecting market power that can be applied beyond the solar market.
The appeal of this approach lies in the simplicity of a pass-through estimation that usually imposes
only limited data and computational demands. Economists and competition authorities therefore
should be particularly interested in industries characterized by over-shifting, as this is often a
strong signal that they are at risk of imperfect competition and may require further investigation.
Of course, the absence of pass-through over-shifting does not imply that the market is perfectly
competitive.

Pass-Through in the Presence of Market Power

We provide the equation for pass-through under monopoly in Equation 2 of the main text. Drawing
directly from Weyl and Fabinger (2013), we derive this equation here by considering the monopolist’s optimization problem and solving for the pass-through rate ρ, or the rate at which the price,
p, changes with marginal cost, mc. The monopolist’s revenues are p(q)q with marginal revenue
mr(q) = p(q) + p0 (q)q and marginal cost mc(q) = c0 (q). The monopolist maximizes profits by
choosing quantity such that mr(q) = mc(q) + t, where t is a per-unit tax on producers. Thus,

Marginal revenue, mr = p + p0 q, is made up of two terms, the price p and the negative of the
marginal consumer surplus ms = −p0 q, which is what consumers earn when quantity expands. As
such, we can write

As discussed in the main text of the paper, there are two key differences between pass-through
under perfect and imperfect competition. First, εD − 1 has replaced εD . Second, more importantly,
there is the new term containing the inverse elasticity of marginal surplus, εms , which measures the
curvature of (the logarithm of) demand. In other words, pass-through under imperfect competition
is not just determined by the elasticity of supply and demand but also the curvature of demand.
As Weyl and Fabinger (2013) discuss more extensively, the inverse elasticity of marginal surplus,
εms , measures the curvature of the logarithm of demand. Recall ms = −p0 q and D ≡ D(p), so

Hence, demand is log-concave when 1/εms > 0 and log-convex when 1/εms < 0. Another
threshold of interest is that 1/εms > 1 for concave demand and 1/εms < 1 for convex demand. This
is because the inverse elasticity of marginal surplus is

and given that q > 0 > p0 , the second term p00 q/p0 is positive if p00 < 0 and 1/εms > 1, and vice
versa.
One can follow similar steps to derive pass-through for the more general case of symmetric,
imperfect competition, which Weyl and Fabinger (2013) show is

where θ is a conduct parameter between zero for perfect competition and one for a pure monopoly.
Analogous to the case of the monopoly with constant marginal costs (infinite εS ), pass-through
exceeds unity if and only if εms is negative since 1/εθ = 0 for many standard models of imperfect
competition, such as Cournot.

Second Order and Stability Conditions

We primarily focus on the threshold for pass-through over-shifting to occur. For completeness, we
note that one may also wish to check the range of εms values against the second order and stability
conditions for the firm’s profit maximization problem to ensure consistency with stable symmetric
market equilibrium. The second order condition states that the second derivative of the profit
function is non-positive. Stability implies that equilibrium is restored when disturbing an initial
equilibrium by changing each firm’s output by any specified amount δ.
Seade (1985) derives these conditions. In our notation, the second order condition under symmetry can be written as

(A.10)

εms <

,
1 − 2n

where n is the number of firms in the market. The stability condition that is necessary and sufficient
under symmetry can be written as

εms < − .

(A.11)

This implies that a stable equilibrium requires stricter conditions than εms < 0 on the range of
prices over which over-shifting occurs.

Additional Details on Data Preparation
Data for the Pass-Through Regressions

The CSI dataset that we start with is the public “working dataset” file posted on the CSI website
on June 24, 2015.37 We took a few other steps to prepare the data in addition to what we describe
in Section 3. First, through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), we obtained a
non-disclosure agreement with the California Public Utilities Commission to gain access to and
transcribe detailed terms from a proprietary dataset of residential third-party solar contracts in
California. Obtaining usable price data from these required our manual transcription because they
lacked consistency across contract type and company, and they were often hand-written. As such,
we stratified the data by quarter and drew a random sample of 200 observations per quarter of all
residential TPO projects with a CSI completion date. Not all contracts that we sampled contained
enough data to construct a net present cost (NPC), leaving us with 1,346 contracts in total with
usable data.
37

The CSI data are available online at https://www.californiasolarstatistics.ca.gov/data_downloads/

41

We impose a number of sample selection rules on the full dataset. We drop a small number
of observations that are most likely data errors. These include two systems with prices above
$20/watt and seven systems with prices below $0.50/watt. Next, we limit the data to installations
with status listed as “installed” or “pending” because if “cancelled” the recorded contract terms
likely do not reflect market conditions. We also drop 13 systems for which the listed incentive
amount exceeds the total reported system cost, which is infeasible and thus data entry error.
We keep only residential systems and those who participate in the Expected Performance Based
Buydown (EPBB) program, which was the upfront lump-sum rebate option offered by CSI. While
residential customers could use a Performance Based Incentive (PBI) instead, more than 99%
of residential consumers opted for EPBB. We also drop observations filed under the Multifamily
Affordable Solar Housing (MASH) program as decision-making for multi-family housing is fundamentally different from individual households. Another non-representative class of contracts that
we drop is those with “GRID Alternatives”, a nonprofit that brings together community partners,
volunteers, and installers to implement projects for low-income families.
We restrict our dataset to systems up to 10 kilowatts, as larger systems are highly unlikely to
have a residential-only purpose. Almost all residential solar electric systems require between 50
square feet and 1,000 square feet, and a general rule that is often applied is that 100 square feet
of solar panels will generate 1 kilowatt of electricity (Hois, 2016). For systems above 10 kilowatts,
there is a high risk of data errors and confusion with small commercial systems, which are outside
the scope of the market we are interested in studying.
We reduce dimensionality in the installer fixed effects by grouping together firms with few
installations. The smallest firms that together install 5% of solar systems are combined into one
category. We apply the same rule for manufacturer and module model fixed effects.
We extend the dataset by merging in demographics at the census tract level using demographics
from the American Community Survey. For that purpose, researchers at NREL geocoded the CSI
data with latitudes and longitudes from address locations. We merged this with the post-incentive
price data as well as the CSI data.
Finally, we end our sample at the end of June 2013. At that time, the CSI program was nearly
exhausted. While Southern California Edison (SCE) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E)
territories still provided CSI rebates at the lowest level, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) ran out of
CSI funding at the end of April 2013.
B.1.2

Data for the Demand Regressions

The dataset we use for the demand regressions is similar to that for the pass-through regressions,
but we modify it in a number of important ways.
First, we need to include all TPO installations in order to capture TPO demand, not just those
whose contracts we transcribed. Second, as the CSI applied to the three IOUs but not municipal
utilities, we need to treat zip codes with partial IOU-coverage carefully. To that end, we obtained
information on all California zip codes serviced by one of the three IOUs as well as zip codes covered
42

by California’s municipal and other utilities, which were not eligible for the CSI.38 We then drop
zip codes that are not serviced by one of the three IOUs or serviced in part by an IOU and in part
by a municipal utility.
Finally, we applied a few more detailed sample selection rules. We manually went through all
zip codes and dropped 13 zip codes that are not flagged as partially outside IOU territory, but a
detailed service area map from the California Energy Commission disagrees.39 We also drop 133
zip codes with zero population; these are business districts or P.O. boxes.
Third, we aggregate the data to the zip code by year level. When doing so, we are faced with
missing variables in the zip code-year combinations where there were no installations. We are
also missing demographic data and electrician worker wages data in some cases, as well as TPO
prices in zip code-years where there are TPO installations but we do not have contract prices. We
interpolate missing data so that we have a balanced panel. We employ the following procedure
to fill in zip code by year level prices and control variables. When such variables are missing for
a particular observation (most commonly for zip code-year observations with zero installations),
we take the county by year average, separately for HO vs. TPO systems. If the county by year
aggregate is still missing (highly unlikely, but possible for some variables, such as electricians’ wages
that are missing for a few sparsely populated counties), we take the population-weighted average
over neighboring counties. In the few cases where we are still missing data (all of which are TPO
prices in zip code-years where we do not have transcribed contracts in our sample), we use utilityyear averages. In this aggregation process, we sum the installations by year for each zip code and
contract type. Since we have a limited time series but only partial coverage of the year 2013, we
pro-rate the installation rate for 2013 using the end date for each utility (discussed above) and the
fraction of systems that were installed in the sample period over the period 2010-2012 (44.34% for
SCE, 42.61% for SDG&E, and 26.42% for PG&E).
Table B.1 provides summary statistics of our demand estimation data from 2010 through 2013.
Demand rates for HO and TPO are not statistically different. As was the case for the pass-through
data, differences for HO and TPO system rebates and post-incentive prices are statistically different
but relatively modest in terms of economic magnitudes, and no demographic differences stand out
besides HO households having just slightly older heads of household and slightly more household
ownership.

Notes: Dataset is a balanced panel with 5,384 observations for both HO and TPO at the zip code-year level. Asterisks

throughout the sample period include the investment tax credit (ITC) for both HO and TPO systems, and the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) benefits for TPO systems
only. We begin by examining the case of HO systems. Recall that the post-incentive price for HO
consumers is the reported total cost minus incentives, such that

(B.1)

pHO,i = T CHO,i − CSIHO,i − IT CHO,i ,

where pHO,i is the post-incentive price for HO consumer i, T CHO,i is the total reported pre-incentive
cost in the CSI database, CSIHO,i is the total CSI rebate amount awarded, and IT CHO,i is the
implied federal ITC benefit. We do not observe the ITC, so we calculate this assuming that it is
fully monetized for all cases. For HO consumers, the CSI rebate is considered a price reduction
for tax credit purposes. Thus, the 30% tax credit applies to the after-rebate net price paid by the
customer:

(B.2)

IT CHO,i = 0.3 ∗ (T CHO,i − CSIHO,i ).

The pass-through of the ITC and CSI incentives cannot be separately identified in our regression
model because they are linear functions of each other, however we must account for the way in which
44

they interact. As implied by Equation B.2, a one-dollar increase in the CSI rebate is effectively a
70 cent increase in total subsidies because the CSI mechanically decreases the value of the ITC by
30 cents. We account for this interaction by adjusting the CSI rebate amount that is used in our
pass-through regressions. To do that, note that we can re-write Equation B.1 such that

(B.3)

pHO,i = 0.7 ∗ (T CHO,i − CSIHO,i ).

However, if we did not adjust our measure of the CSI subsidy, our regression would estimate

(B.4)

pi ∼ α + βCSIi + εi ,

where a one-dollar increase in the CSI subsidy would be interpreted as a one-dollar increase in the
total subsidy received. As the actual one-dollar increase in the CSI is worth only 70 cents from the
consumer’s and installer’s perspectives, we multiply the CSI subsidies by a correction factor of 0.7,
as we want to interpret our pass-through coefficient β as the impact on prices of a full one-dollar
subsidy increase.
Adjusting for federal incentives for TPO systems differs somewhat from the HO adjustment
for two reasons: the ITC is calculated in a slightly different way, and TPO systems also benefit
from MACRS. The post-incentive price that we construct for TPO systems is a net present cost
calculation that embeds all incentives (since contract terms are subsidy-inclusive). As such, we do
not need to explicitly net out the ITC and MACRS from a gross cost measure (as we do for HO
consumers). However, we note that for TPO consumers

(B.5)

pT P O,i ≡ N P CT P O,i = Ui +

t
X
paymentiy
y=1

(1 + d)t

,

where pT P O,i is the post-incentive price of system i, or the net present cost of the contract to the
customer as described by Equation 7, which embeds the ITC and MACRS. As before, we need to
account for these other incentives in our pass-through regressions as they interact with the CSI
rebate. First consider the ITC for TPO consumers. The CSI rebate is not a price reduction for
tax credit purposes as it is for HO consumers. Instead, the federal ITC received by third parties
is based on gross installed cost: IT CT P O,i = 0.3 ∗ T CT P O,i . The ITC is thus unaffected by the
CSI as the basis for the 30% credit is not reduced by the CSI rebate amount. However, the IRS
considers the CSI rebate to be earned income and therefore subject to corporate taxes. Hence, the
effective CSI subsidy is (1 − tc )CSI, where tc is the corporate tax rate. Hence, we need to multiply
the CSI subsidies by (1 − tc ) in the TPO case in order to interpret our pass-through coefficient as
the impact of a full dollar increase in the rebate. We do not observe the effective marginal tax
rate of each installer in our sample, but following Borenstein (2017), we assume it is 30%—close
45

but somewhat lower than the 35% rate for large companies. Using 35% would scale up our ITC
pass-through estimates and make the estimated difference between HO and TPO pass-through even
more pronounced.
The second federal subsidy to take into account is MACRS. Over our entire sample period,
residential solar PV systems were eligible for 5-year accelerated depreciation as well as an especially
high “bonus” depreciation in the first year. For systems placed into service after September 8, 2010
and before January 1, 2012, the first-year bonus depreciation rate was 100%; it was 50% during the
other periods in our sample. Under 50% first-year bonus depreciation, the depreciation schedule
was (50% bonus + 10% MACRS =) 60%, 16%, 9.6%, 5.76%, 5.76% and 2.88% for years one through
six, respectively. Under 100% first-year bonus depreciation, the system was fully depreciated for
tax purposes in year one.
Our goal is to calculate a MACRS “adjustment factor” based upon the structure of the MACRS
program assuming a one-dollar increase in the CSI rebate. We use Borenstein (2017)’s assumptions.
Again, we want to interpret a one-dollar increase in the CSI subsidy as a one-dollar increase in
total subsidy received. The reasoning is similar to that for the ITC adjustment in the case of HO:
there is a reduction in the present value of the MACRS benefit following a one-dollar increase in
CSI because firms were able to depreciate 85% of the system cost after state rebates. In other
words, the allowable depreciable basis is equal to 0.85 ∗ (T C − CSI). The net present value of the
reduction in tax savings (depreciation benefits) resulting from a one-dollar increase in the CSI for
TPO systems is

(B.6)

where my is the MACRS recovery rate in year y, r is the firm’s discount rate, and tc is the firm’s
marginal corporate tax rate (which we assume to be 30%, following Borenstein (2017)). D is the
allowable depreciable basis, which is equal to 0.85 for solar PV systems.
We calculate real adjustment factors for a range of nominal discount rate assumptions that align
with our NPC calculations (2% to 12%). Furthermore, we calculate different sets of adjustment
factors based on when the program allowed for 50% and 100% bonus depreciation. We assume that
all third parties took advantage of the MACRS program. We thus determine if systems qualified
for 50% or 100% bonus deprecation based upon installation date, since eligibility was determined
based on the date the system went into service. This date is not included in the CSI database, so
we matched the CSI data to the publicly available NEM interconnection dataset. fM ACRS ranges
from 0.21 to 0.25 depending on the discount rate and the type of bonus depreciation.
Finally, we adjust the CSI rebates for ITC, corporate taxes, and MACRS benefits for our
pass-through regressions such that

Additional Theory Figures

In Figure 1 of the main text we show how over-shifting occurs in the presence of market power when
demand is log-convex. Figure C.1 demonstrates two related cases where pass-through cannot exceed
unity to further illustrate why both sufficiently convex demand and market power are needed to
explain over-shifting. Panel A illustrates how pass-through falls between 0 and 100% under perfect
competition but with convex demand. Perfectly vertical marginal costs would imply 0% passthrough and flat marginal costs would imply 100% pass-through. Panel B shows how pass-through
is exactly 50% for the case of monopoly but with linear demand and constant marginal costs.

Additional Figures and Tables for the Pass-Through Estimates

Figure C.2 shows the total daily installations in each of the three IOU territories for our sample
period 2010Q1-2013Q2.40 The figures demonstrate some amount of bunching of applications just
before the rebate drop dates. This is consistent with the findings in Hughes and Podolefsky (2015).41
This bunching reflects a certain degree of strategic timing behavior on part of consumers and
installers. These drop dates could not be perfectly foreseen as they were triggered by reaching a
threshold of cumulative installed capacity within each IOU. This date is hard to predict exactly,
however the CSI announced on a public website how many CSI megawatts (MW) worth of rebates
remained in the current incentive step level. This web-based CSI Trigger Tracker allowed users
to anticipate when the rebates were going to drop to the next level by comparing “MW Under
Review” with “MW Remaining”. The rebate level is determined at the time of the reservation, not
the time of project completion, so it was possible to strategically submit reservations as each IOU
approached step capacity targets.
Table C.1 shows our baseline specification with increasingly flexible controls and fixed effects.
Columns 1-7 gradually add more controls. Throughout all specifications, we find that the difference
in pass-through between TPO and HO consumers is large and statistically significant, but we need
detailed controls to estimate pass-through more accurately, especially for HO consumers.

C.3.2

Robustness Checks

Table C.3 shows how the demand parameters vary with two important alternative sample selection
or variable construction rules. First, we compute the solar installation rate by dividing installations
by the number of people who live in houses they own (using information on owner-occupied housing
from the census) instead of total population. Renters are unlikely to install solar systems as they do
not always capture the full benefits because of limited housing tenure, their apartments or houses
are typically less suitable for solar panels, and they need to get property owner approval. Relatedly,
homeowners who lease their properties to others may be unlikely to install solar panels when they
40
Note that daily “installations” are actually “rebate reservations”, since the dates refer to the day when rebate
reservations were filed as opposed to when installations were completed.
41
CSI residential rebates in the SDG&E region were briefly suspended after January 31st , 2013, but it became clear
soon afterwards that residential rebates would continue at the same rate per watt as $5 million from the commercial
solar project budget was shifted to residential installations (Center for Sustainable Energy 2014). Around January
31st , however, some consumers may have thought the CSI rebates had run out while in fact they had not. We
therefore show this date as a dotted vertical line in Figure C.2, panel B.

Notes: Dependent variable is the post-incentive system price per watt. Data cover systems installed in California
for consumers who applied for the CSI rebate during the period 2010-Q2 2013. Controls include census tract level
demographics and a dummy if there is more than one inverter. A 7% discount rate is assumed for the net present cost
and MACRS calculations. Standard errors clustered by zip code. In Panel A, the p-value labeled “HO pass-through

Notes: Dependent variable is the solar system installation rate, either based on owner-population (panel A) or based
on total population (panels B and C). Observations are at the zip code by year level. Data cover systems installed
in California for consumers who applied for the CSI rebate during the period 2010-Q2 2013. Controls includes the
same demographics that we use in Table 2, as well as tiered electricity rates. A 7% discount rate is assumed for the
net present cost and MACRS calculations. IV estimates in columns 3 and 4 instrument for (squared) price using
the (squared) CSI rebate and the (squared) county-level electrician/wiring wage rate. F-statistic is the SandersonWindmeijer multivariate F-test of excluded instruments (for each of the first-stage regressions). Standard errors
clustered by zip code. Asterisks denote *p <0.10, **p <0.05, ***p <0.01.

We conclude that the results when adjusting for homeownership are similar to those in the
main specification in Table 6. The parameter values are larger in absolute value, but note that
the mean of the dependent variable (the installation rate) is about twice as large since we divide
by owner-occupied housing population, not total population. The implied elasticities are also
similar. Similarly, dropping small zip codes does not qualitatively affect our results: the estimates
are smaller but still indicate substantial convexity. Similarly, including small zip codes does not
qualitatively affect our results: the estimates still indicate substantial convexity.
We also ran IV specifications using only the linear CSI rebate and electrician/wiring wage rate
52

(but not their squares) as instruments. In this case, we have a weak instruments problem for
the TPO regression. The coefficient on the squared price indicates convexity, but the TPO point
estimates are large and noisy yet still not statistically different from any of the point estimates
from alternative specifications.42
C.3.3

Calculating Convexity Measures

In order to calculate the convexity parameter εms of Equation 2, we need inverse demand and
therefore we invert our estimated demand equation. This is straightforward using the quadratic
formula and price and squared price parameters estimated in Table 6. We first calibrate the
constant by evaluating our estimated demand equations (one for HO and one for TPO) at a fixed
price and with all other control variables at their sample means. From this, we obtain a simplified
demand expression q = ap2 + bp + c (with a and b as the estimates from Table 6 and c calibrated
as described above). Next, we solve for p(q) using the quadratic formula. We differentiate the
resulting expression to obtain p0 (q) and p00 (q). This allows us to evaluate the criterion given by
Equation A.8 along different points at the demand curves, where 1/εms < 0 indicates over-shifting
under the assumptions of the model. The results are discussed in Section 6 of the main paper.

For HO, the coefficients on price and squared price equal -0.812 and 0.062, respectively. For TPO, these coefficients
are -48.304 and 6.443. None of these coefficients are statistically significant. For TPO, the p-value of the SandersonWindmeijer F-statistics for price and squared price are 0.22 and 0.22, respectively.
