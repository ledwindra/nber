    "abstract": "\n\nAn impatient and risk-neutral government can sell bonds at any time to a more patient group of competitive lenders. The key problem: the government cannot commit to either a particular financing strategy,  or a default strategy.  Despite risk-neutrality,  in equilibrium debt adjusts slowly towards a target  debt-to-income  level,  exacerbating  booms  and  busts.   Most  strikingly,  for  any  debt  maturity structure,  the  gains  from  trade  are  entirely  dissipated  when  trading  opportunities  are  continuous, as  lenders  compete  with  each  other  and  the  government  competes  with  itself.   Moreover,  citizens who are more patient than their government are strictly harmed by the unrestricted borrowing.  We fully characterize debt dynamics, ergodics, and comparative statics when income follows a geometric Brownian motion, and analyze several commitment devices that allow the sovereign to recapture some gains from trade: self-imposed restrictions on debt issuances and levels, as well as \u201cmarket-imposed\u201d discipline.\n\n",
