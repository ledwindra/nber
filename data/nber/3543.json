Daily data for the European Monetary System are used to explore the importance of non-linearities in the relationship between the exchange rates and fundamentals. Many implications of existing \"target-zone\" exchange rate models are tested; little support is found for existing non-linear models of limited exchange rate flexibility.\n\n",
