ABSTRACT
The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly disrupted the economy. This paper attempts to
quantify the macroeconomic impact of costly and deadly disasters in recent US history, and to
translate these estimates into an analysis of the likely impact of COVID-19. A costly disaster
series is constructed over the sample 1980:1-2020:04 and the dynamic impact of a disaster shock
on economic activity and on uncertainty is studied using a VAR. While past natural disasters are
local in nature and come and go quickly, COVID-19 is a global, multi-period event. We therefore
study the dynamic responses to a sequence of large disaster shocks. Even in a fairly conservative
case where COVID-19 is a 5-month shock with its magnitude calibrated by the cost of March
2020 Coronavirus relief packages, the shock is forecast to lead to a cumulative loss in industrial
production of 20% and in service sector employment of nearly 39% or 55 million jobs over the
next 12 months. For each month that a shock of a given magnitude is prolonged from the base
case, heightened macro uncertainty persists for another month.

Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 has signi…cantly disrupted the economy. This paper attempts to
quantify the macroeconomic impact of costly and deadly disasters in recent US history, and to
translate these estimates into an analysis of the likely impact of COVID-19. A costly disaster
series is constructed over the sample 1980:1-2020:04 and the dynamic impact of a disaster shock
on economic activity and on uncertainty is studied using a VAR. While past natural disasters
are local in nature and come and go quickly, COVID-19 is a global, multi-period event. We
therefore study the dynamic responses to a sequence of large disaster shocks. Even in a fairly
conservative case where COVID-19 is a 5-month shock with its magnitude calibrated by the
cost of March 2020 Coronavirus relief packages, the shock is forecast to lead to a cumulative loss
in industrial production of 20% and in service sector employment of nearly 39% or 55 million

from the base case, heightened macro uncertainty persists for another month.

Introduction

Short term ‡uctuations in a typical economic model are presumed to be driven by random
shocks to preferences, factor inputs, productivity, or policies that directly impact the supply
or demand of goods and services. While there is some scope for considering ‡uctuations attributable to shocks driven by natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis, these types
of “conventional” disaster shocks are typically assumed to be short-lived, with an initial impact that is local in nature. It is only when these shocks propagate across sectors, states, and
countries that the aggregate e¤ects are realized.
Figure 1 shows the responses of US ‡ight departures, initial claims for unemployment insurance, and macro uncertainty from Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng (2015) to Hurricane Katrina in
2005:08. The number of ‡ight departures dropped immediately in response to Katrina’s landfall
and both initial claims and macro uncertainty rose sharply. But the impact on initial claims
was highly transitory, while the peak e¤ects on macro uncertainty and ‡ight departures slowly
build.
A global pandemic is likewise a natural disaster that functions as an exogenous shock with
potentially grave economic consequences. But unlike a conventional natural disaster shock, the
Coronavirus (COVID-19) shock is a multi-period event that simultaneously disrupts supply,
demand, and productivity channels, that is almost perfectly synchronized within and across
countries, and that has cataclysmic health, social, and economic implications not just for the
foreseeable few weeks after the crisis, but for a long time period.
The ability to design policies to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19 requires reference estimates of the e¤ects of the shock. This paper provides some preliminary estimates of
these e¤ects. Our analysis has two ingredients. The …rst is the construction of a costly disaster
(CD) time series from historical data to measure the pecuniary costs of previous disasters. The
second is an analysis of the dynamic impact of a costly disaster shock on di¤erent measures of
economic activity and on a measure of uncertainty. We then design di¤erent pro…les for the
shock to engineer the dynamic e¤ects of a natural disaster interpreted as a large, multi-period,
constraint on the ability to produce and consume, as would be characteristic of a pandemic.
We …nd that the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 is larger than any catastrophic event
that has occurred in the past four decades. Although the CD series has short memory, the
e¤ects on economic activity are more persistent. Even under a fairly favorable scenario where
the shock persists for only …ve months and where the initial magnitude is calibrated by the
cost of Coronavirus relief packages passed in March of 2020, the estimates suggest that there

will be a peak loss in industrial production of 12% and in service sector employment of 5.28%
respectively. This translates into a cumulative ten-month loss in industrial production of 20.5%,
an employment loss of nearly 39% (or 55 million jobs), and …ve months of elevated macroeconomic uncertainty. Estimates that allow for nonlinear e¤ects give more pessimistic predictions
entailing steeper and longer losses. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the very
few time-series analyses of natural disasters on aggregate economic activity, and the …rst such
study of COVID-19.

Data and Methodology

Our analysis uses monthly data on disasters a¤ecting the U.S. over the last forty years taken
from two sources. The …rst is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

2

(NOAA), which identi…es 258 costly natural events ranging from wild…res, hurricanes, ‡ooding,
to earthquakes, droughts, tornadoes, freezes, and winter storms spanning the period 1980:12020:04 for T = 482 data points, of which 198 months have non-zero cost values.1 These data,
which can be downloaded from ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events, record both the …nancial
cost of each disaster as well as the number of lives lost over the span of each disaster. As
explained in Smith and Katz (2013), the total costs reported in NOAA are in billions of 2019
dollars and are based on insurance data from national programs such as ‡ood insurance, property claims, crop insurance, as well as from risk management agencies such as FEMA, USDA,
and Army Corps. We take the CPI-adjusted …nancial cost series as provided by NOAA, and
mark the event date using its start date. To obtain the monthly estimate, we sum the costs of
all events that occurred in the same month.

ten costliest catastrophes in the US reported in 2018 dollars. The data, available for download
from www.iii.org/table-archive/2142, covers property losses only. Thus the cost for the
same event reported in the III dataset is lower than that reported in the NOAA dataset. But in
agreement with the NOAA data, the III dataset also identi…es Hurricane Katrina as the most
costly disaster in US history. The III dataset is of interest because it records 9/11 as the fourth
most costly catastrophic event, arguably the most relevant historical event for the purpose of
this analysis given the large loss of lives involved. But as 9/11 is not a natural disaster, it is
absent from the NOAA data. We therefore use the III data to incorporate the event into the
NOAA data. To deal with the fact the two data sources de…ne cost di¤erently, we impute the
cost of September 11 as follows. We …rst compute the ratio of cost (in 2018 dollars) of Katrina
relative to 9/11 from the III data, which is 1.99. We then divide the cost of Katrina in NOAA
data by this ratio to get the insurance-based estimate of 9/11 cost in the same units as those
reported in NOAA.
It is more challenging to measure the dollar cost of the COVID-19 shock. Ideally, one would
measure the total dollar cost of mandatory stay-at-home orders across the United States. Although …rm-level insurance against losses attributable to business closures exists, these policies
cover only short-term closures due to idiosyncratic incidents such as …re and ‡ooding–they do
not cover losses due to pandemics or legally mandatory shut-downs. We therefore instead use
the dollar value of the Coronavirus relief packages that were passed by U.S. Congress and signed
into law in March 2020 as a crude estimate of the dollar cost of COVID-19.2 These packages
total 3.01 trillion dollars, authorized in four separate measures.3 This dollar cost dwarfs any of
those associated with previous U.S. natural disasters in our dataset. The nonlinearities implied
by outlier shocks are partially addressed in the penultimate section of the paper.
An important limitation of the data needs to be made clear at the outset. With the exception
of Hurricane Sandy, the natural disasters in our data have been concentrated in the southern
states with FL, GA, or LA having experienced disasters most frequently. However, industrial
production is concentrated in the New England area, the Great Lakes area, the mid-West, and
the Mid-Atlantic States which have been much less impacted by natural disasters. The data
may not be able to establish a clear relation between industrial production and disasters.

We also use a more conservative estimate from the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, as
discussed below.

The packages include 26 billion for testing, 217 billion for state and local governments, 312 billion for public
health, 513 billion for all businesses in the form of tax breaks meant to help all businesses, 532 billion for large
corporations in the form of loans, 784 billion for individuals, and 871 billions for small businesses in the form
of forgivable loans under certain conditions.

The cost measures are based on monetary damages but do not include the value of lives
lost, which is another measure of the severity of the disaster. Separately reported in NOAA is
the number of deaths associated with each event. Since the number of deaths directly linked
to 9/11 is known to be 2,996, we are able to construct a deadly disaster series that tallies the
number lives lost for all 259 events considered in the analysis.4
Figure 2 plots the resulting costly disaster (CD) series, in units of billions of 2019 dollars,
and the deadly disaster (DD) series, in units of lives lost. There are four prior events in the
CD series that stand out: Hurricanes Katrina in 2005, Harvey/Irma/Maria in 2017, Sandy in
2012, and 9/11 in 2001. As a point of reference, the value of CD at these four events are at
least four standard deviations away from the mean of the series. In terms of the number of
deaths, the sum of the DD series over the sample is 14,221, but three events, namely, Hurricane
Harvey/Irma/Maria, 9/11, and Katrina, accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total deaths.
Both disaster series are evidently heavy-tailed, and we will return to this point below.5 Because
the size of the increases in both our calibrated COVID-19 CD shock and COVID-19 deaths
dwarfs the previous disasters, the latter are shown in inset on the …gure, where the COVID-19
values appear on the far right.
Because both the CD and the DD values for COVID-19 represent extreme observations even
relative to any of the previous U.S. natural disasters in our dataset, we estimate the parameters
of all of our empirical speci…cations on pre-COVID-19 data, from 1980:01 to 2020:02. Where
we use the COVID-19 observations on CD and DD, instead, is in engineering shock pro…les
that may be deemed more appropriate for the COVID-19 disaster. Speci…cally, we use these
data to help calibrate the size and duration of the COVID-19 event as they pertain to shocks to
CD. We use the deaths data in the penultimate section of the paper in a nonlinear speci…cation
designed to capture the e¤ects of extreme disasters that are also deadly.
We will also make use of two additional pieces of information from these two data …les. The
…rst is the number of states being a¤ected as reported in III. For example, Katrina directly
impacted six states: AL, FL, GA, LA, MS, TN, while the direct impact of 9/11 was local to the
city of New York and the D.C. region. The second is the duration of the event. As reported in
NOAA, Katrina was a …ve-day event, Superstorm Sandy was a two-day event, while the 9/11
attack was a one-day event. From 1980 to 2019, the average duration of an event is 40 days
and ranges from one day (e.g., 9/11 and 2005 Hurricane Wilma) to one year (e.g., the 2015
Western Drought). These statistics will be helpful in thinking about the size of the COVID-19

We also considered CD scaled by real GDP (in 2019 dollars). The VAR analysis using scaled series delivers
quantitatively similar results. It’s worth noting that 1992 Hurricane Andrew and 1988 Drought costed more,
scaled by 1992 and 1988 real GDP, than 2012 Hurricane Sandy.

To estimate the macroeconomic impact of a disaster shock, we begin as a baseline with a

one of four measures of real activity that will be discussed below. The long-run trends of all
three variables are removed using the methodology in Müller and Watson (2017) before the
VAR estimation.6
We estimate the VAR using monthly data from 1980:01 to 2020:02, and thus exclude the
extremely high value of CD during the COVID-19. The reduced form VAR is

series is ordered …rst given that the disaster events are, by their very nature, exogenous. The

the last from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and is available from 2000 onwards. IP
is a common benchmark for economic activity, while unemployment claims are perhaps the
most timely measure of the impact on the labor market. In the data, initial claims one month
after Katrina (i.e., September 2005) increased by 13.3% compared to its level the previous
year. The variable ESI is studied because non-essential activities such as going to restaurants,
entertainment, repairs, and maintenance can be put on hold in the event of a disaster, and
these are all jobs in the service sector. Disasters tend to disrupt travel due to road and airport
closures. Data constraints limit attention to air tra¢ c disruptions, as measured by the number
of scheduled ‡ight departures, SFD.

Responses to a One

For each measure of Y, we estimate a VAR and compute the response coe¢ cient

scaled

so that it corresponds to a one standard deviation increase in the innovation to CD. In what
follows, the blue line depicts the median response and the dotted lines refer to 68 percent
con…dence bands. Since the dynamic responses of CD and U to a CD shock are insensitive to
the choice of Y and U, we only report these two impulse response functions using the VAR with
IP as Y.
The top left panel of Figure 3 is based on the measure of macro uncertainty in Jurado,
Ludvigson, and Ng (2015) (JLN). It shows that the impact of a one-standard deviation positive
CD shock on itself dies out after two months, suggesting that the CD is a short-memory process
that does not have the autoregressive structure typically found in SVARs for analyzing supply
and demand shocks. The top right panel of Figure 3 shows that JLN uncertainty rises following
a positive CD shock, and that the heightened uncertainty persists for three months. The bottom
panel replaces the JLN measure of macro uncertainty by the measure of …nancial uncertainty
developed in Ludvigson, Ma, and Ng (2019) (LMN). A CD shock raises …nancial uncertainty
for one month but quickly becomes statistically insigni…cant. The bottom right panel uses the
measure of policy uncertainty (EPU) in Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016). A costly disaster shock
increases policy uncertainty for about three months, similar to the duration of the impact on
JLN uncertainty. In both cases, uncertainty is highest one month after the shock. These results
suggest that short-lived disasters have statistically signi…cant adverse e¤ects on uncertainty that
persist even after the shock subsides.
Next, we consider the e¤ect of a one standard deviation CD shock on four measures of Y , all

using JLN macro uncertainty in the VAR. The left top panel of Figure 4 shows that monthly IP
immediately drops by 0.05% on impact but becomes statistically insigni…cant after two months.
As seen from Figure 3, two months is also the duration needed for the CD series to return to
zero. There is, however, some evidence of a strong rebound in the economy but the e¤ect is not
statistically well determined. The small estimated e¤ect of CD on IP may be attributable to
the fact that natural disasters have not had much direct impact on regions of the U.S. where
the bulk of industrial production takes place. The top right panel shows that a CD shock
triggers a statistically signi…cant rise in unemployment claims IC for about two months with a
statistically signi…cant decline in claims (i.e. a rebound in employment) thereafter.
The bottom left panel of Figure 4 shows that a CD shock leads to an immediate and
statistically signi…cant drop in the number of employed workers in the service industry, ESI.
Unlike results using IP and IC as Y, the ESI response is more persistent, with the e¤ect
bottoming out at about 4 months. It is worth noting that ESI is a national measure of service
employment and may mask the higher impact in some regions. The bottom right panel shows
that a CD shock forces an immediate and persistent decline in the number of scheduled ‡ights,

the largest, but also the most sustained. Though recovery follows right after the shock, the
process is slow, taking up to six months for the e¤ect to become statistically insigni…cant.

distributions of all VAR parameters are estimated using Bayesian estimation with ‡at priors and the 68%
con…dence bands are reported in dotted lines. The sample spans 1980:01 to 2020:02.

Taken together, this baseline estimation using pre-COVID-19 data suggests that a oneperiod, one-standard-deviation increase in CD will have statistically signi…cant adverse e¤ects
on real economic activity. Though there are variations in how long the impact will last, for all
four real activity measures considered, the e¤ects of the one period shock will die out within a
year.
COVID-19 di¤ers from historical disasters in several dimensions. The initial impact of
the historical disasters had been local in terms of both the geographical area and population
a¤ected. In fact, never in the 30 years of data was there a disaster that involved more than
one of the …ve largest states in the country simultaneously. The historical disasters were also
short-lived, and with the exception of a drought that lasted over a year, they have an average
duration of only one month. Even with 9/11, the North American airspace was closed for a few
days while Amtrak stopped service for two days, but activity resumed by September 14, albeit
9

14

gradually.
The same cannot be said of COVID-19. COVID-19 is a global pandemic and the e¤ects
traverse across states and countries. In April 2020, 91% of the world population live in countries
with restricted travel.7 By contrast, the most disastrous events in our CD disaster series in terms
of loss of life were Katrina and 9/11, but the number of deaths due to COVID-19 far exceeds
the deaths due to Katrina and 9/11 combined. Moreover, …ve months into the pandemic, the
crisis had yet to reach its peak, and there is a good deal of uncertainty as to whether normalcy
will return by the end of 2020. Social distancing was not imposed in past disasters, and
Gascon (2020) documents that the consequence of social distancing may be particularly harsh
for those employed in the service sector. Past disasters created destruction in physical capital,
while COVID-19 creates no such damage. Instead, the labor force is constrained from working
e¢ ciently, and resources are diverted to unanticipated uses. Finally, as mentioned above,
industrial production was not severely impacted by past natural disasters. Taken together,
these considerations suggest that the dynamic e¤ects of CD need to be altered to re‡ect shock
pro…les commensurate with our understanding of COVID-19, which means shocks that last
longer than one period, and much larger than one standard deviation.

E¤ects of Prolonged Shocks

This section addresses the problem that COVID-19 is not a one-shot shock. Ideally, the duration
of the shock is the life of the virus which is not only unobservable, but potentially endogenous.
To the extent that a COVID-19 shock can be thought of as an economic shock that constrains
consumers and producers from conducting economic activities, we use the expected duration of
the ‘stay-at-home’policy as the government’s expected duration of the shock.
Let Xt collect all information in X at time t and at all lags. From the moving-average
representation of the SVAR given in (1), we see that if there are two consecutive shocks of one
standard deviation, the dynamic response of Xt+h is

If the shock in t is of size :5 , and the one at t + 1 is of size 2 , the desired response matrix is
:5 h + 2 h 1 . Scaling and summing the h coe¢ cients allows us to evaluate all the dynamic

Figure 5 reports the response of CD and U, similar to Figure 3, except that there are now
three consecutive one-standard deviation shocks. To avoid clutter, the con…dence bands are
not plotted as their signi…cance can be inferred from Figure 3. The red line is the same as the
one period shock reported in Figure 3 and serves as a benchmark. Evidently, the CD series now
requires three months to die out after a two-period shock, and four months after a three-period
shock. The e¤ects on all measures of uncertainty become larger and more persistent. Taking
the JLN measure as an example, U peaks after three months instead of one, and is four times
larger.

single period, presumably because initial claims can only be …led once, and the losses are front
loaded, and always occurs one month after the shock. However, multi-period shocks slow the
time to recovery from two months to four. For ESI and SPD, there is a clear ampli…cation
e¤ect due to consecutive shocks. At the worst of times, employment loss in the service sector
is tripled that due to a one-shot shock, and the series is not back to control for well over three
quarters. Similarly, instead of an immediate recovery, multi-period shocks reduce scheduled
‡ight departures by two more months before a slow recovery begins.

Results for Multiperiod Multi- Shocks

We now engineer the shock pro…le to re‡ect our understanding of the COVID-19 disaster.
For this, we consider dynamic responses to multi-period large shocks. To get a sense of the
magnitude of COVID-19, note that by the end of March 2020, 10 million Americans had made
initial unemployment insurance claims, which is a 900% increase compared to February 2020,
comparable in magnitude to that during the Great Depression. Furthermore, as of August
2020, COVID-19 has already resulted in 159,000 deaths in the US, which has more fatalities
12

12

than the Korean War (92,134) and has exceeded the number of deaths due to the Vietnam War
(153,303).8
Thus, for the magnitude of the shock, our baseline pro…le of COVID-19 is based on the
fact that Hurricane Katrina was a 11 shock and the magnitude of the CD series for 2020:03
based on the March relief package is 17.5 times larger than the cost of Katrina. We therefore
take 192 (11 times 17.5) as the benchmark magnitude of COVID-19. We also consider a more
conservative pro…le based on an estimated cost of business closure provided to us by American
Property Casualty Insurance Association, which results in a one-trillion dollar cost during the
peak of COVID-19.9 This translates into a cost of COVID-19 that is 5.9 times larger than that
of Katrina, and therefore we take 65 as the magnitude of COVID-19 for this case.
As for the duration, we calibrate the shock pro…les by using the fraction of states that are
listed as “not reopening”weighted by their GDP contributions as of 2019:Q4. Table 1 reports
the fraction of GDP (2019:Q4) earned in states that are categorized as reopened/reopening
versus those that are not. As of July 31, 52.4% of 2019:Q4 GDP was earned in states that are
not reopening. Some of these states are pausing or reversing previous reopening plans because
of the surge of new COVID-19 positive cases in late June and early July. Therefore, we …rst
calibrate the size of shock in July to be 52.4% of the size of shock in March (192 ) or 100
shock. If we assume that the shock was zero in the interim months, then the …ve-month shock
pro…le from March 2020 to July 2020, is a (192,0,0,0,100) standard deviation shock pro…le.
As an alternative pro…le, we also consider a …ve-month (192,0,88,79,100) shock pro…le. This
alternative pro…le is based on the fraction states that were not reopening weighted by their
GDP contributions from May to July.
A large shock shifts up the dynamic responses relative to a one-standard-deviation shock
presented in Figure 4, while a multi-period shock shifts the dynamic responses to the right as
shown in Figure 6. It is of interest to ask how the dynamic responses would change if the disruption is spread over more periods. Figure 7 plots the dynamic responses of a (192,0,0,0,100)
shock pro…le in dark blue. Plotted next in dotted blue is a …ve-month (192,0,88,79,100)

These preliminary estimates were calculated by the American Property Casualty Insurance Association
(APCIA), in the framework of looking at Business Interruption type of coverages (which do not normally cover
pandemics). So they do not directly re‡ect assumptions about total revenue and/or total operating expenses,
which would result in larger numbers. According to APCIA, the main component driving these estimates
are payroll and bene…ts. These estimates consider potential insurance type costs per month if all businesses
in the US are closed and all receive compensation for the relevant costs – lost pro…t, payroll/bene…ts, and
partial/additional expenses.

The source of the data is from the New York Times (link: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/statesreopen-map-coronavirus.html). “Reopening”states include all those that are either “reopening”or “reopened.”
“Not reopening” includes all states that are assigned to one of the following categories: “regional opening,”
“shutdown,” “pausing,” and “reversing.” The state-level 2019 GDP estimates are obtained from Bureau of
Economic Analysis.

The picture that emerges from Figure 7 is that cumulative losses are primarily determined
by the total magnitude of the shock rather than the magnitude in any one period. But the
longer the duration holding the shock size each period …xed, the larger are the losses and the
slower the recovery. The losses for ESI and SFD are particularly steep and persistent.
We report in Table 2 the maximum response in a 12-month period, where the location of
the maximum can be inferred from Figure 6. Table 2 also reports the cumulative loss over the
months with negative responses.10 These maximum and cumulative losses are reported for four
di¤erent shock pro…les. The …rst two shock pro…les, (192,0,0,0,100) and (192,0,88,79,100) ,
have initial magnitudes that are calibrated based on the Coronavirus relief package passed
in March 2020. The next two shock pro…les, (65,0,0,0,34) and (65,0,30,27,34) , have initial
magnitudes that are calibrated based on the APCIA insurance cost. Then the size of the
subsequent shocks are calibrated based on the fraction of states that are not reopening, as
de…ned above.
Table 2 shows that our …rst shock pro…le (192,0,0,0,100) will lead to a maximum drop in
industrial production of 12.04% occurring after one month, a 5.28% maximum loss in service
sector employment (over 7 million jobs) occurring after four months, and a 118.63% reduction
in scheduled ‡ights after two months. The reduction in service sector employment implications
are not trivial because over 75% of workers (or over 140 million) are employed in the service
sector. The implied cumulative reduction of 39%, or loss of nearly 55 million service sector jobs
10

The cumulative responses could be overestimated because the response can be statistically zero at lags much
earlier than the point estimate of the response crosses the zero line.

Nonlinearities

While there were 259 disasters in our data, most of these were small. A linear model may underestimate the e¤ect of large shocks. We therefore consider a model that allows the coe¢ cients
to be di¤erent for severe disasters, where the degree of severity is measured by the number of
deaths. Let St be an observable variable. We estimate a series of single equation regressions,
one for each h, to obtain the dynamic response at lag h

is a logistic function in the number of deaths in our deadly disaster series,
where St = 1+exp(

DD, normalized to be mean zero and variance one. By construction, St is bounded between

zero and one and downweights extreme observations to a degree that depends on the parameter
. St is close to one in the most deadly disasters (when DD is large) and close to zero in the
least deadly disasters. To form a benchmark for comparison, we consider using the values St
would take during three di¤erent disasters: using deaths during the month of hurricane Katrina
in August of 2005, the month of September 11 of 2001, and using the average monthly deaths

su¢ ciently large, St is approximately the same value (unity) for all these three deadly events,
so a high- calibration would be unable to distinguish them. (See Figure A1 for a plot of St
under di¤erent values of ). Therefore we choose

= 0:25 for the baseline estimation, resulting

in St = 0:85, 0:95, and 1 for Katrina, September 11, and COVID-19, respectively.

and more persistent. The sensitivity of to these results to the choice of

(A2). Naturally, real variables have larger negative responses to CD shock when

since smaller values give greater weight to extreme values of DDt .
Table 3 summarizes the maximum and cumulative negative responses for the shock pro…les
studied above, but this time using the nonlinear model under the COVID-19 calibrated value
of SDDj = 1.12 Compared to estimates from linear VAR reported in Table 2, the maximum
impact of the disaster shock is much larger for all measures of activity, particularly so when
the shock extends more than one period. The …rst pro…le of (192,0,0,0,100) shocks now leads
to a maximum one-month reduction in IP of 50:02% after one month, a 742% reduction of
scheduled ‡ights after nine months, and service employment loss of 31:80% after nine months,
which is roughly 45 million jobs. The cumulative 12-month losses are also much larger than the
VAR estimates imply, generating a cumulative drop of 143% in IP and 286% in service sector
employment. For the (192,0,88,79,100) pro…le, the numbers are even larger, with a cumulative
decline in service sector employment of 445%. This more pessimistic scenario may have seemed
inconceivable at the beginning of 2020, but between March to July 2020 alone there were 55
million new unemployment insurance claims in the US.
12

The estimated CD shock for Katrina from the regression of CD series on the RHS variables in equation (2)
is 11.4 above its mean. Therefore, we continue to take 192 as the benchmark magnitude of COVID-19 for
the nonlinear model.

Conclusion

From monthly data on costly disasters a¤ecting the U.S. over the last forty years, we provide
some preliminary estimates of the macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 over the next 12 months
from the start of the crisis in February/March of 2020. We …nd that even in a fairly conservative
scenario without nonlinearities, large multiple-period shocks like COVID-19 could plausibly
create a 12% monthly drop in IP, a cumulative loss of more than 55 millions jobs in the service
industry, sustained reductions in air tra¢ c, and heightened macroeconomic uncertainty several
months. The nonlinear model suggests even more pessimistic outcomes.
There are, of course, caveats to the analysis. First, COVID-19 is di¤erent from past disasters
in many ways, and the historical data may well over- or under-estimate the e¤ects. As mentioned
above, the disasters in history have not led to serious disruptions in industrial production. The
smaller losses found for industrial production must be interpreted in this light. Second, we
have focused the dynamic responses under one year because the longer horizon results are not
well determined. This could be a consequence of the short-memory nature of disaster shocks.
Third, to the extent that the CD series is heavy-tailed, it is fair to question whether standard
Bayesian sampling procedures or frequentist asymptotic inference based on normal errors are
appropriate. Nonetheless, the di¤erent pro…les all suggest steep declines in economic activity,
with the longer the duration of the shock, the larger the cumulative losses.

Note: The …gure plots the dynamic responses to a positive one-standard deviation CD shock from the non-linear
model with di¤erent values of speci…ed in the subtitle. The red line is the dynamic responses using COVID-19
calibrated value for S corresponding to DD = 40,000 average monthly deaths and the black line uses value of
DD series from Katrina. The dynamic responses for the nonl-inear model are estimated via local projection.
The sample spans 1980:01 to 2020:02.
