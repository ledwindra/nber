Inequality and Market Concentration, When Shareholding is More Skewed than Consumption
Joshua Gans, Andrew Leigh, Martin Schmalz, and Adam Triggs
NBER Working Paper No. 25395
December 2018
JEL No. D42,D43,D61,D63
ABSTRACT
Economic theory suggests that monopoly prices hurt consumers but benefit shareholders. But in a
world where individuals or households can be both consumers and shareholders, the impact of
market power on inequality depends in part on the relative distribution of consumption and
corporate equity ownership across individuals or households. The paper calculates this
distribution for the United States, using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances and the
Consumer Expenditure Survey, spanning nearly three decades from 1989 to 2016. In 2016, the
top 20 percent consumed approximately as much as the bottom 60 percent, but had 13 times as
much corporate equity. Because ownership is more skewed than consumption, increased markups increase inequality. Moreover, over time, corporate equity has become even more skewed
relative to consumption.

1. Introduction *
In 2009, Aspen Pharmacare announced its acquisition of five cancer medicines from its
competitor GlaxoSmithKline. As the sole producer of those drugs, Aspen didn’t just acquire
medicines, it also acquired substantial market power. The implications were swift. The price
of Busulfan, a medicine used by leukaemia patients, increased 1,100 per cent by 2013: from
£5.20 to £65.22 in the United Kingdom. The price of Chlorambucil, another leukaemia drug,
rose from £8.36 to £40.51 (Kenber, 2017). But it wasn’t just the price of medicines that
increased. From the time of the acquisition to after it had increased prices, Aspen
Pharmacare’s share price increased almost seven-fold (Marketwatch, 2017). The result of
increased market power, therefore, was a wealth transfer from consumers to shareholders.
More generally, over the past generation, most advanced nations have seen an increase in
inequality (Alvaredo et al 2018). At the same time, a growing body of evidence points to an
increase in market power, both in terms of rising market concentration (eg Economist 2016)
and increasing markups (De Loecker and Eeckhout 2018). A burgeoning literature suggests
that superstar firms are capturing increasingly high market shares, allowing them to use their
market position to earn excess profits (Andrews et al 2015; Autor et al. 2017). As the gap
between ‘frontier firms’ and ‘laggard firms’ widens, shareholders of frontier firms may enjoy
larger returns.
Market power has been further increased in some markets through the increased prevalence
of horizontal shareholding – where common investors own competing firms (e.g. Azar,
Schmalz and Tecu, 2018). Indeed, the rise in economic inequality since 1980 corresponds to
a period when institutional investors’ share of corporate stock grew to record levels (Elhauge,
2016). In addition to these changes in market structure and indications of reduced
competition from increased price-cost margins, other measures of competition also declined.
For example, the word ‘competition’ is used 75 per cent less frequently since 2000 in the
annual reports of US companies (The Economist, 2017). These developments have led
scholars to ask whether market power may be one of the causes of growing inequality
(Posner and Weyl 2015; Furman and Orszag 2015; Barkai, 2016; Ennis et al 2017).
Answering this question is very important, because the purported increases in market power
have often been defended on the basis that many citizens own shares in these firms, see e.g.
Novick (2017). However, if a large fraction of consumers are systematically less affluent and
hold a smaller fraction of shares than more affluent shareholder-consumers, then market
concentration may worsen income inequality.
We inform this debate with a formal theoretical argument as well as new empirical facts.
Specifically, we explore under which conditions market power can transfer wealth from
consumers to shareholders, what impact these mechanics can have on income inequality,
whether these conditions are met in practice, and how those facts have changed over the past
three decades. The answer to the question whether increases in corporate market power

increase inequality largely depends on where consumers and shareholders are located across
the respective distributions of consumption and equity ownership. If all families are identical,
increased monopoly power does not change inequality, as all households are treated similarly.
Moreover, the loss of families’ consumer surplus from monopoly prices is compensated by
increased returns on their shareholdings. 1 But if wealthier families are more likely to be
shareholders and poorer families are more likely to be consumers, then monopoly pricing can
have a direct effect in worsening inequality. 2
We document that, in the United States, the distribution of corporate equity is skewed
towards the top of the distribution, more so than the skewness of consumption. That fact
indicates that, to the extent that market power benefits equity holders, these gains flow
overwhelmingly from the less to the most affluent.
Our analysis follows the empirical strategy of Ennis et al (2017), but with the difference that
we focus on a single country (the United States). This allows us to focus on corporate equity,
rather than assuming that the distribution of equity holdings mirrors the distribution of wealth
(a potentially problematic assumption, given that residential property constitutes a large share
of the wealth of many families). It also permits us to look at changes over time as opposed to
a single cross section, since our data span the period 1989 to 2016. Using these data, we are
able to document the extent to which holdings of corporate equity have become substantially
more unequal over time, and how this magnifies the adverse effect of market power.
The related literature is long and rich. Comanor and Smiley (1975) found that possibly onehalf of existing wealth holdings by the richest few per cent of American households was due
to monopoly gains. Subsequent empirical research using Australian data found that the
welfare loss associated with monopoly power is largest for poor households (Creedy and
Dixon 1998, 1999). Others have looked at the industries in which those who populate the rich
list made their money (Blitz and Siegfried, 1992). Another strand of research has speculated
on the role that increased dividends and capital gains from monopoly pricing can play in
increasing wealth at the top (eg Khan and Vaheesan, 2017). Others have shown how
imperfect competition contributes to the ‘poverty penalty’ - the relatively higher cost
shouldered by the poor compared to the non-poor in their participation in certain markets
(e.g. Mendoza, 2011; Atkinson, 2015).
Perhaps the most similar study to ours is Ennis et al (2017), who analyze data for eight
OECD countries. They posit an equation under which the impact of market power on
inequality can be estimated from the average mark-up, the labour income share, average
savings rates, the marginal propensity to save, and observed income and wealth shares. Their
results suggest that market power has a significant impact on increasing the wealth of top
groups, and reducing the income of bottom groups.
1
However monopoly pricing may have effects on inequality through other variables such as reduced output and
reduced labour income, and monopoly pricing will still have negative welfare effects through reduced output.
2
If holders of corporate equity internalize their preferences as consumers, they may use their voting power
within the firm to bring about the competitive price. But, as shown by Farrell (1985), this logic also relies on
assuming perfect homogeneity of shareholder-consumers.

3

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 elaborates the theory on how monopoly pricing
can increase inequality and models the circumstances under which the internationalization of
consumer preferences by shareholder-consumers could offset this effect. Section 3 introduces
the data and methodology used to calculate the distributions. Section 4 explains the results
from our distributional analysis. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of what these findings
could mean for competition policy.

2. Theory
A critical question in the literature is to what extent shareholder-voting power can defeat the
link between market power and higher product market prices. Farrell (1985) considered the
situation where a consumer’s utility is the sum of their consumer surplus and their share of
firm profit in a single-firm economy. He found that consumers will unanimously vote for the
competitive pricing only if ownership shares are equal to consumption shares for all
consumers.
To see this point formally, consider an economy with a single firm and a continuum of
. Each consumer has identical utility, u(xi), a non-decreasing function of
consumers,
their consumption of the firm’s output, xi. The per unit price of the good is p. In addition,
consumers receive a fixed (identical) labor income, y. Finally, consumers have an equity
share, i, in the firm. For simplicity we assume that i is non-decreasing in i. Let

.

The firm has costs, C(X), that are assumed to be non-decreasing and convex. Therefore, the
value of i’s shareholding is simply, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝜋𝜋 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 − 𝐶𝐶(𝑋𝑋)). We consider owner-consumer
preferences over p.
First, it is useful to review Farrell’s (1985) result in this framework. He assumed that
consumers solved:
surplus

. This yields a demand function:

and a

both of which are, under our symmetry assumptions, the same for all

consumers. However, in voting over the firm’s pricing policy, a shareholder’s preferences are
the solution to: 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑝𝑝 𝑣𝑣(𝑝𝑝) + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑝𝑝) − 𝐶𝐶(𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛(𝑝𝑝)) which gives FOC:
−𝑣𝑣 ′ (𝑝𝑝) = 𝑥𝑥(𝑝𝑝) = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 (𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛(𝑝𝑝) + �𝑝𝑝 − 𝐶𝐶 ′ �𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛(𝑝𝑝)�� 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛′(𝑝𝑝))

(1)

where the first equality follows from Roy’s identity. If each consumer has a shareholding of
1/n, then it is clear that (1) becomes
; the efficient outcome. In our symmetric
case, this corresponds to a proportional allocation of shareholdings. 3
Farrell’s characterisation is only of a unanimity condition: everyone prefers the efficient
price. He does not consider the outcome of voting per se (as we would expect to arise
amongst shareholders). Of course, for efficiency to be the outcome of voting, only the median
voter has to have this preference. To see this, note that i’s voting objective, 𝑣𝑣(𝑝𝑝) + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝜋𝜋(𝑝𝑝)
3

When consumers have heterogeneous demands, the proportional allocation would involve

satisfies the (strict) single crossing property in (p, αi) as (𝑣𝑣′(𝑝𝑝) + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝜋𝜋′(𝑝𝑝))/𝜋𝜋(𝑝𝑝) is
increasing in αi for p less than the profit maximising price. This means that if i prefers

over

, then so does any

; i.e., those with more shares prefer higher prices. By

Theorem 1 of Gans and Smart (1996), this means that the outcome of majority voting over
prices will be the same as the median voters preference ordering. From this it is easy to see
𝑛𝑛
that if the median shareholder (i.e., i such that 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ∫𝑖𝑖 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ≥ 12) has a shareholding of 1/n,

then the efficient price will be the voting outcome amongst shareholders.

In contrast to Farrell (1985), we assume that the consumer chooses consumption to solve:
subject to 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝜋𝜋 + 𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 . This yields indirect utility function, 𝑉𝑉(𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝜋𝜋 + 𝑦𝑦, 𝑝𝑝) =

𝑢𝑢(𝑝𝑝1(𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝜋𝜋+𝑦𝑦)). That is, at prevailing prices, consumers allocate all of their income to
consumption expenditure; i.e., 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑝𝑝1(𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝜋𝜋+𝑦𝑦)). Notice that this assumes that, when choosing xi,

i does not take into account its own impact on π. This is reasonable given the infinitesimal
nature of consumers.

In this circumstance, equilibrium profits are 𝜋𝜋 = 𝜋𝜋 + 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 − 𝐶𝐶(𝑝𝑝1(𝜋𝜋+𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛)) ⇒ 𝜋𝜋 = 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶 −1 (𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛) −
𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛. Note that this means that
then

for the firm to be financially viable. Note also that if

, for all i, and

.

We can equilibrium profits to consider a voter’s preferences over p. Note that a voter will
seek to maximise their equilibrium consumption subject to the firm’s break-even constraint.
If shares were allocated proportionately with 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 = 1/𝑛𝑛, then
. In this situation,
no voter has a preference over price with every equilibrium involving all non-profit income
allocated to the firm’s costs, C(X). Thus, with proportionate allocation, the equilibrium
consumption is always socially efficient and p is redundant.
For other share allocations, taking the derivative of consumption with respect to p gives:
𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖
1
= 2 (𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝑛𝑛 − 1)𝑦𝑦
𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝

This means that i will have a preference for a high price if 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 > 1/𝑛𝑛 but will prefer

if 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 < 1/𝑛𝑛. If 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 = 1/𝑛𝑛, then i is indifferent as to the price level. Note that 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 ) has the
single crossing property in (p, αi) as 𝑝𝑝1(𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝑛𝑛−1)𝑦𝑦/𝜋𝜋 is increasing in αi for all feasible p.
Moreover, for this single good model, as individual utility increases in their consumption the
single crossing property holds for preferences. 4 Thus, so long as the median voter’s share
does not equal 1/n, the voting outcome will either be

or the monopoly price. 5

The Farrell (1985) approach that does not make this assumption would require a more complicated analysis to
examine whether this property held.
5
The model assumes that each agent has the same exogenous income, y. We did this to illustrate the main
effects of the theory. Simon Cowan usefully points out that we could give individuals different income. In this
case,

5

This result extends the domain of share allocations that can achieve an efficient outcome as a
voting equilibrium; namely from the median voter having share 1/n to this being the upper
bound on their share. This arises because of a combination of the break-even condition and
the single good nature of the economy. The former condition is one that Farrell (1985) did
not explicitly consider as it did not bind in his formulation. Importantly, it also shows that if
the distribution of voting shares is more concentrated relative to consumption shares amongst
individuals, then there will be a preference amongst shareholders for higher than efficient
prices and the exercise of market power.

3. Data and methodology
Our principal data source is the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. The survey
conducted triennially, starting in 1989. Our results thus include ten years over a 27-year span,
starting in 1989 and ending in 2016. Our measure of corporate equity sums stock holdings
and business equity. Analysis is conducted on a family basis, with families ranked on their
percentile of income before taxes.
We supplement this with expenditure data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Although
the Consumer Expenditure Survey is an annual survey that covers a longer timespan than the
Survey of Consumer Finances, we restrict our analysis to years in which the Survey of
Consumer Finances was conducted. The Consumer Expenditure Survey is conducted on the
basis of a ‘consumer unit’. In multi-family households, this corresponds to groups of people
who make joint expenditure decisions, so conceptually consumer units are closer to families
than households. Henceforth we refer to them as ‘families’ for simplicity. As with the Survey
of Consumer Finances, the Consumer Expenditure Survey ranks families on their percentile
of income before taxes. We focus our analysis solely on total expenditure.
Following Ennis et al (2017), we estimate the impact of market power on inequality for a
given quantile group as a function of the observed share of income and corporate equity in
the presence of market power, the average excess mark-up, the income share of labour, the
average saving rate, and the marginal propensity to save. Where superscripts c and m index
the competitive and monopolistic cases, subscript i indexes quantile groups, y denotes income
share, f denotes wealth share, µ is the excess markup, ∝𝐿𝐿 is the labour share, s' is the marginal
propensity to save, and 𝑠𝑠̅ is the average saving rate, the counterfactual income share of a
quantile group without market power is given by the following formula:
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑐𝑐 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚 +

1−

𝜇𝜇 − 1

𝑠𝑠 ′
𝑠𝑠̅

(1 − 𝜇𝜇𝛼𝛼𝐿𝐿 )

(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚 − 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚 )

that a consumer’s demand increases in price if their share of profit income is larger than their share of
exogenous income.

6

Ennis et al (2017) present three sets of results, for 𝑠𝑠 ′ = 𝑠𝑠̅ (a conservative scenario),
(a central scenario), and

𝑠𝑠 ′

= 1.5

= 2 (an optimistic scenario). For reasons of parsimony, we simply

present results for a central scenario, in which

𝑠𝑠 ′
𝑠𝑠̅

= 1.5.

4. Distributional analysis
Figure 1 shows the distribution of expenditure by each income quintile. The 20 percent of
families with the lowest incomes accounted for 9 percent of all expenditure in 1989, the same
figure as in 2016. The 20 percent of families with the highest incomes comprised 38 percent
of all expenditure in 1989. By 2016, the expenditure share of the top fifth had risen to (only)
39 percent. In other words, the distribution remained roughly similar.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of income across families. Because our analysis is based on
pre-tax family income, our income measure is more skewed than in analyses that look at
individuals, or at post-tax income. In 1989, the bottom fifth of US families earned 3 percent
of national income, and this share was also 3 percent in 2016. However, the top fifth of US
families received 57 percent of income in 1989, and 64 percent in 2016. Hence, by contrast to
consumption, the distribution of income has become more skewed in the past three decades.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of corporate equity, being the sum of stock holdings and
business equity. 6 Note that because we are ranking families by pre-tax income, the corporate
equity shares of the population will not necessarily rise monotonically. In fact, we observe
that from 2007 onwards, the bottom quintile has a larger share of corporate equity than the
second-bottom quintile. These families in the bottom quintile may include those with badlyperforming small businesses, or elderly families whose asset holdings are disproportionate to
their incomes.
The lowest-income fifth of families had 1.1 percent of corporate equity in 1989, and 2.0
percent in 2016 (over the same timespan, the second-bottom quintile share went from 3.5
percent to 1.6 percent, so the total share of corporate equity of the bottom 40 percent fell). By
contrast, the highest-income quintile had 77 percent of corporate equity in 1989, and 89
percent of corporate equity in 2016. Hence, corporate equity is considerably more skewed
than expenditure or income, and has become considerably more skewed over the past three
decades.

The Survey of Consumer Finances data that we rely upon do not allow us to separately identify stock holdings
within retirement accounts.

In Figure 4, we show the ratio of the top 20 percent share to the bottom 60 percent share for
each of the three measures: expenditure, income and corporate equity. In 1989, the top 20
percent consumed 0.97 as much as the bottom 60 percent, a ratio that had risen only to 1.02
by 2016.
The ratio of income increased more dramatically over this period. In 1989, the top fifth had
2.4 times as much income as the bottom three-fifths. By 2016, this had risen to 3.3 times as
much.
The most marked increase is in corporate equity. In 1989, the top 20 percent had 6 times as
much corporate equity as the bottom 60 percent. This ratio rose to 13 in 2001, dropped to 8 in
2010, and has since risen back to 13. On this particular metric, corporate equity is 13 times as
concentrated as expenditure.

Finally, we calculate the impact of market power on the distribution of income. Figure 5
shows income shares for the top fifth and the bottom three fifths as they are currently
measured (solid lines) and in the hypothetical case of fully competitive markets (dashed
lines). In 2016, removing market power would cause the bottom 60 percent income share to
rise from 19 percent to 21 percent, and would cause the top 20 percent income share to fall
from 64 percent to 61 percent.
These results show that the absence of market power would somewhat equalise the
distribution of incomes, but also puts into perspective the size of the impact. The rise in
income inequality over the period that we study has been considerable, and even in the
absence of market power, incomes would be more concentrated in 2016 than they were in
1989.

5. Conclusion
A common rule of thumb in inequality analysis is that wealth is more unequally distributed
than income, which is in turn more unequally distributed than consumption. A similar pattern
holds true when we narrow our analysis to corporate equity.
Our documentation of this fact corroborates one previously hypothesized channel through
which market concentration may increase inequality. By increasing producer surplus and
decreasing consumer surplus, monopoly power effectively acts to transfer resources from
low-income families to high-income families. Moreover, as our extension of Farrell (1985)
shows, the fact that voting shares are more concentrated than consumption leads to a
preference amongst shareholders for higher than efficient prices and the exercise of market
power, which can exacerbate the problem still further.
This effect is likely to be magnified in capital-intensive industries. For example, the
increasing use of industrial robots in a market where firms have significant market power
may act to increase equity returns, increase consumer prices, and reduce the labor share.
Additionally, it is worth noting that our analysis does not take account of the fact that some
14 percent of equities are held by foreigners (Department of the Treasury, 2018). These nonUS stock holders, such as sovereign wealth funds, also benefit from a rise in market power.
This result implies that engendering more competition would not only have efficiency
benefits, but attenuate the rise of inequality as well. Whether going down this route is a
desirable policy choice is a question beyond the scope of this paper and left for future study
and debate.
