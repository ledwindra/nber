R&D Investments with Competitive Interactions

NBER Working Paper No. 10258
January 2004
JEL No. G31, O32, O22
ABSTRACT
In this article we develop a model to analyze patent-protected R&D investment projects when there
is (imperfect) competition in the development and marketing of the resulting product. The
competitive interactions that occur substantially complicate the solution of the problem since the
decision maker has to take into account not only the factors that affect her/his own decisions, but
also the factors that affect the decisions of the other investors. The real options framework utilized
to deal with investments under uncertainty is extended to incorporate the game theoretic concepts
required to deal with these interactions. Implementation of the model shows that competition in
R&D, in general, not only increases production and reduces prices, but also shortens the time of
developing the product and increases the probability of a successful development. These benefits
to society are countered by increased total investment costs in R&D and lower aggregate value of
the R&D investment projects.

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

1. Introduction
Among all types of investment projects patent-protected R&D (research and development) investment
projects pose one of the most diﬃcult tasks for evaluators. The main reason for this is that there are
multiple sources of uncertainty in R&D investment projects and that they interact in complicated ways.
The problem is so complex that until recently it was not possible, even with numerical methods, to analyze
them. The development of numerical simulation methods that deal with optimal stopping time problems
(Longstaﬀ and Schwartz 2001) has now made this possible.
R&D investment projects typically take a long time to complete and since there is a learning process about
the R&D project as investments proceed, there is large uncertainty about the investment costs required for
the R&D project. There is not only uncertainty about the total costs of the development, but also about
the time it will take to complete the development. In essence, there is learning while investing. Moreover,
during the development phase there exists a possibility that exogenous factors such as political or technical
disasters can put an end to the R&D investment project. These type of catastrophic events are very common
in R&D investment projects because of the long investment time horizon.
Once the development phase is completed, the resulting product is produced and marketed. During this
marketing phase there is uncertainty about the demand for the product as well as the supply of competing
products. Seen from the start of the development phase these uncertainties are magniﬁed by the fact that
it is not even clear what the exact product that comes out of the R&D investment project would be. In
addition, if the resulting product is patent-protected and the patent is obtained during the development
phase of the R&D investment project, there will be uncertainty not only about the level of the cash ﬂows
produced, but also about the duration of these cash ﬂows since the starting date of the marketing phase is
uncertain but the expiration date of the patent is ﬁxed.
The possibility of competing products during the marketing phase plays a crucial role for the R&D
investment decisions during the development phase since also the competing products have to go through a
similar development phase. Moreover, competition in the development phase feeds back into the marketing
phase in the sense that the competitive interactions in the development phase may have the eﬀect that some
of the competitors terminate their R&D investment projects even before they complete their development.
In this article we develop a model to analyze patent-protected R&D investment projects that takes into
account all the sources of uncertainty described above. In particular, we combine elements of real options
theory with equilibrium concepts from game theory to study this problem where the R&D investment
decisions of one player depend critically on the decisions of the other players. These competitive interactions

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

aﬀect the valuation problem both in the development phase and in the marketing phase. The possibility of
an oligopolistic outcome in the marketing phase aﬀects the decisions taken by the players in the development
phase.
We have concretized our problem by taking as an example an R&D investment project from the pharmaceutical industry. This is a particularly interesting problem since the investments required to develop a
new drug are in the magnitude of hundreds of millions of dollars and typically take more than ten years to
complete. Moreover, these R&D investment projects are usually patent protected at a very early stage of
the development phase. Without taking competitive interactions into account Schwartz and Moon (2000)
and Schwartz (2001) have also studied R&D investment projects in the pharmaceutical industry using a
real options framework. In this article we mainly focus on the competitive interactions between competing
ﬁrms. In the monopoly situation the owner of the R&D investment project can assume that the probability
distribution of the underlying is exogenously given, whereas in the oligopoly situation the decisions of all
players aﬀect this probability distribution. Hence, the probability distribution of the underlying becomes
endogenous and it is therefore part of the equilibrium outcome.
Many of the aspects of our R&D investment problem have been analyzed separately in a number of
articles in the literature. Grenadier and Weiss (1997) and Bernardo and Chowdhry (2002) concentrate on
the experience obtained in the investment process, but do not consider competitive interactions. The idea
is that the option to invest is also an option to get more experience with a certain technology, i.e. learning
by investing, and that this should be taken into account when analyzing the optimal time to invest. The
aspect of competition is considered by Williams (1993), who analyzes the competitive exercise of options
to invest. The main point is that as more investors exercise their options, the less attractive it is for other
investors to exercise their options because of a downward sloping demand curve. The aspect of competition
and especially the problem of coordinating the investment behavior is further analyzed by Huisman and
Kort (1999) and Huisman, Thijssen, and Kort (2001). Huisman and Kort (1999) argue that the perfect
coordination between the competing investors assumed by Williams (1993) is not an equilibrium outcome
without cooperation between investors; in a non-cooperative setting it can happen in equilibrium that more
than one investors invest simultaneously. Huisman, Thijssen, and Kort (2001) generalize these results by
allowing for mixed strategies by competing investors. The aspect of asymmetric competing ﬁrms is analyzed
by Pawlina and Kort (2001). Smit and Ankum (1993) is the ﬁrst article to combine sequential investment
options with competitive issues. Their discrete two-period binomial model captures some of the same features
as our model. A similar model but in continuous time is developed by Baldursson (1998), who shows that

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

4

the problem can also be solved as a central-planner problem for a speciﬁcally engineered ﬁctitious social
planner. Finally, Grenadier (2002) adds a time-to-build feature to this model. The models in the last three
articles have in common that investors have a number of capacity options they can exercise. In deriving the
optimal exercise strategy for these capacity options investors take into account both the impact that their
own exercise strategy, as well as the exercise strategies of the other investors, have on the market. None of
these models have the feature of a ﬁnite time horizon, which is essential to deal with patents with ﬁnite life.
Since these models deal with capacity expansion, they do not distinguish between a development phase and
a marketing phase, which is critical in R&D investment projects. Some of these models capture learning
by investing in the sense that exercising an investment option reveals more information; Grenadier (2002)
adds a time-to-build feature in the sense that it takes a certain amount of time from when the decision to
exercise an option is taken and until the pay oﬀ is realized. But none of the models capture learning while
investing in competitive markets in the sense that investments take time and information is revealed while
investing, so that it can become optimal to abandon the investment project even before completion because
of competitive interactions.
Grenadier (1999) and Lambrecht and Perraudin (1999) introduce asymmetric information issues in the
competitive exercise of options to invest. In these one-investor-one-option models there are no compound
option aspects. Grenadier (1999) shows that asymmetric information can lead to informational cascades.
Lambrecht and Perraudin (1999) concentrate on preemption in winner-takes-it-all competitive investment
games.
In our model we consider two ﬁrms which are investing in R&D for two diﬀerent drugs targeted to cure
the same disease, so that if both are successful they would have to share the same market. The fact that,
if both are successful, they will obtain duopoly proﬁts instead of monopoly proﬁts in at least part of the
marketing phase of the product, implies that during the development phase, each ﬁrm will take into account
not only its own situation but also the situation of its competitor, to make its R&D investment decisions.
The costs to completion of the R&D investment project for each ﬁrm are assumed to follow stochastic
processes through time with two types of shocks, i.e. technical shocks, which are idiosyncratic to each ﬁrm,
and input cost shocks, which are common to both ﬁrms. In addition, during the development phase there is
a Poisson probability of catastrophic events for each R&D investment project in the sense that it may have
to be terminated because of some terrible side eﬀect in the clinical trials or other reasons. The winning firm,
that is, the ﬁrm that ﬁrst successfully completes the R&D investment project, starts receiving monopoly
proﬁts in the sale of the drug until the losing firm eventually completes the R&D investment project, at

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

5

which point both ﬁrms share the duopoly proﬁts from the sale of the drug. The demand for the drug is
also stochastic and we assume that the demand shocks follow a geometric Brownian motion. We allow also
for the input cost shocks, common to both R&D investment projects, to be correlated with the demand
shocks since both can depend on general market conditions. The equilibrium investment and production
strategies for both ﬁrms are derived in a Cournot-Nash framework. During the development phase we focus
for each ﬁrm on the optimal stopping time to exit the R&D investment project which represents the optimal
exercise of the option to abandon the R&D investment project. Note that the optimal exercise strategy
for the abandonment option for one ﬁrm depends on the exercise strategy of the other ﬁrm and vice versa,
so that the values of both R&D investment projects and the optimal exercise strategies have to be solved
simultaneously.
While the problem is initially formulated in continuous time, it is solved using a discrete time approximation. Since there is no closed form solution to the complex problem we formulate, we solve the problem
using numerical simulation methods. We apply an extended version of the least-squares approach proposed
by Longstaﬀ and Schwartz (2001) for valuing American options, to determine the optimal stopping time for
both ﬁrms, taking into account the competitive interactions.
For comparative purposes, when we report the results of the analysis for the duopoly situation, we also
report the corresponding results for the monopoly situation. The monopoly situation corresponds closely
to the real option problem solved by Schwartz (2001). However, in order to make this comparison more
fair to the monopoly situation in our model, the monopolist has access to both R&D investment projects.
Obviously, the monopolist will invest in the most valuable of the two projects, but, in addition, she/he
has the option to invest in the second project as a backup project. The value of a backup project to the
monopolist is, however, limited in the sense that she/he will only get beneﬁts from the project if either the
main project is hit by a catastrophic event or if it turns out that the main project is more expensive to
develop than the backup project.
In reporting the results we mainly concentrate on the symmetric case, that is, when both R&D investment
projects are identical in the duopoly situation. Though the computer program we have developed to solve
the problem numerically is able to handle a great deal of generality, most of the interesting insights of the
model can be better observed in the symmetric case. Without loss of generality, we concentrate on the case
where the patents for both competitive drugs expire at the same date. If, on the other hand, the patents
have diﬀerent expiration dates, there is no value in the second patent protection when the ﬁrst patent expires
since generic drugs related to the ﬁrst drug will be introduced and be able to compete with the second drug.

The model provides some interesting results with potentially important policy implications. As expected,
the value of the R&D investment project to the monopolist is higher than the aggregate value of the R&D
investment projects for both duopolists since both have to share the same demand. Unless the R&D investment projects are very marginal, the amount produced is on average higher for the duopolists, not only
because when both are producing simultaneously they produce a larger amount (at a lower price), but also
because the probability that at least one of the duopolists eventually produces is higher than the probability
that the monopolist produces, and on average the time until the ﬁrst project is completed is shorter. If the
R&D investment projects are very marginal competition in R&D can actually harm the development if there
is no mechanism to select which of the two duopolists who should invest and who should abandon. Hence,
if the objective of the policy maker or regulator is to promote the production of the largest possible amount
of drugs at the lowest possible price in the shortest period of time, competition in R&D accomplishes this
objective in most cases. Only in the cases where the R&D investment projects are very marginal can it be
beneﬁcial to protect one single developer from competition in order to accomplish these goals. One should,
in addition, have in mind that the total costs to R&D are higher in the duopoly situation and that the
value of the R&D investment projects is lower. The model presented can also be used to derive other policy
implications such as the eﬀect of subsidies or drug price and/or quantity commitments on the amount of
R&D investments.
The article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and derives the Cournot-Nash type
equilibrium. Section 3 explains the numerical solution procedure used in the implementation of the model.
Section 4 describes the numerical results and performs sensitivity analysis of these results with respect to key
parameters of the model. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the article and provides some concluding remarks.

2. The Model
We assume that two ﬁrms are each investing in R&D for a drug that is targeted to cure the same disease.
Both ﬁrms take out a patent on their speciﬁc drug at date zero based on their earlier (pre patents) R&D.1
The two patents are based on diﬀerent molecules and will lead to diﬀerent drugs, but both drugs are targeted
to cure the same disease. Before the drugs can be marketed, some post patents R&D must be conducted
(further research, development, testing, clinical trials, etc.). When the ﬁrst drug is marketed, the drug will
be protected from competition by the patent so that the owner would be able to earn a monopoly proﬁt until,
eventually, the second ﬁrm markets its competing drug. When that second drug is marketed, the two ﬁrms
will still be protected from further competition by their two patents. Hence, the two ﬁrms have the only two
drugs for this disease and will therefore be able to earn a duopoly proﬁt.2 This situation continues until the
two patents expire.3 When this happens, we assume that generics will ﬂood the market and drive all proﬁts to
zero in a perfect competitive market setting.4 The whole time line of our model is summarized in Figure 1.
The important decision variables for our two ﬁrms are the post patents R&D investment/abandonment
decisions. That is, based on the information of both the ﬁrm’s own and its competitor’s estimated remaining
R&D investments and forecasts of the demand for the drug, each ﬁrm must consider whether it is worthwhile
for it to continue investing in R&D or whether it should abandon its R&D investment project. In order to
solve that problem we ﬁrst have to develop a model for the consumption market where the drug is eventually
going to be sold.
We start by modeling the market for drugs for a given disease. We assume that the price of the drug,
denoted Pt , at any given date, t, is given by
Pt = Yt Q(qt ),
when the date t instantaneous production rate is qt . Here Y is an exogenously given stochastic process that
models demand shocks to the model. That is, Y captures stochastic shocks that change the demand of the
drug, e.g., epidemics, acts of terror, development of vaccines, non-anticipated alternative drugs, etc. We

The assumption that both ﬁrms take out their patents at the same date is not important. The game could also (without loss
of generality) start at the date when the second ﬁrm takes out its patent.
2
Note that here we have abstracted from the fact that one of the drugs may be more eﬃcient than the other and, thus, may
capture a larger share of the market.
3
If the two patens do not expire on the same date, then this situation only continues until one of the two patents expire.
4
It would be easy to introduce some terminal value to the R&D investment projects at the expiration of the patent period.

duopoly supply situations.7 For a = 15 and b = 0.1 we have depicted the inverse demand function, Q(·), in
Figure 2.
If there is only one ﬁrm which has monopolistic supply of the drug at date t, this ﬁrm would simply
control the production rate, qt , to maximize the instantaneous proﬁt rate, Πt , given by
2

Πt ≡ Pt qt = Yt aqt e−bqt .
Note again that for simplicity we have assumed that the variable direct production cost rate is zero. The
optimal monopoly production rate at date t, q M , is easily derived as

qM = √ ,

which is independent of t. Since in the monopoly case there is only one ﬁrm producing, this production rate
will also be the total production rate at any date. It implies a monopoly price at date t of

and a monopoly proﬁt rate at date t of

The superscript M indicates monopoly.
If there are two ﬁrms, indexed one and two, competing for selling drugs to cure the same disease at date
t, we assume that these two ﬁrms compete in a Cournot competitive fashion. In order to calculate the
corresponding market equilibrium we ﬁrst would have to calculate the two ﬁrms’ response functions. Given
ﬁrm j ∈ {1, 2} has set its production rate at date t to qjt , consider the problem of ﬁnding the optimal
production rate for the other ﬁrm, which is indexed i = 3 − j,8 at date t. Given ﬁrm j ∈ {1, 2} has set its
production rate at date t to qjt , ﬁrm i = 3 − j should maximize its instantaneous proﬁt rate at date t as a

7For simplicity we assume that variable production costs are zero, because this signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes our analysis. Basically,

the only role for the inverse demand function, Q, is to provide two diﬀerent production levels, one for the situation where there
is only one producer, the monopoly situation, and one for the situation where there are two producers, the duopoly situation.
Production costs would only matter for the decision of how much to produce when the drug is marketed. If there are positive
production costs, the inverse demand function, Q, should just be altered so that it gives the two optimal production rates as
solutions when the production costs are included in the optimization and so that the corresponding function values are the
proﬁt rates. The whole analysis can then be carried out the same way as it is in the article. In the pharmaceutical industry
variable production cost rates have little importance relative to R&D investment costs. That is, variable production cost rates
can be neglected from the problem without any signiﬁcant alterations of the qualitative conclusions from our analysis.
8There are exactly two ﬁrms in our model, indexed one and two. Hence, if one ﬁrm has index j ∈ {1, 2}, the other ﬁrm must
be indexed 3 − j.

dropped by a factor e ≈ 1.65 and total proﬁt rates have dropped by a factor 2e ≈ 1.17, see Figure 2.
If there is perfect competition, standard microeconomic arguments give that the proﬁt of each (identical)
ﬁrm is driven to zero. In our model we have assumed that variable production cost rates are zero so this
means that the sum of the production rates for all the ﬁrms would converge to inﬁnity and the corresponding

The superscript P C indicates perfect competition.
This characterizes the situation our two ﬁrms will face when their respective R&D investment projects
eventually develop into a drug that can be marketed. That is, in real options terms we have characterized the
underlying security. However, in order to develop the drug the ﬁrms have to go through an uncertain phase
of R&D. At date zero when the ﬁrms take out their patents, each of the two ﬁrms has an estimate of the
costs of the remaining R&D investments, K10 and K20 , that they each still have to conduct. These estimates
of remaining R&D investment costs are assumed to be public information, i.e. common knowledge.9 At any
given date t the estimated remaining R&D investment costs for ﬁrm i ∈ {1, 2} is given by the stochastic
variable, Kit . For tractability we assume that the whole process of past and present estimated remaining
R&D investment costs, {(K1s , K2s )}s∈[0,t] as well as the past and present values of the demand shock process,
{Ys }s∈[0,t] , are public information. As long as ﬁrm i has not yet abandoned its R&D investment project,
the stochastic process, Ki , for i ∈ {1, 2}, develops over time under an equivalent martingale measure, Q,
according to the stochastic diﬀerential equations
(2)

dKit = −Ii dt + γi



Ii Kit dzti + µik Kit dt + σik Kit dWtk .

Here z 1 , z 2 , and W k are standard Brownian motions under Q. The ﬁrst term in equation (2) reﬂects the
rate at which the ﬁrm invests in R&D for the drug at date t.10 Since the decision to continue investing
in R&D is an irreversible decision, the current investment rate, Ii , must at any date t be non-negative.
Furthermore, since it takes time to conduct R&D, the current investment rate, Ii , must at any date t be
ﬁnite. The second term in equation (2) reﬂects the uncertain nature of the R&D process itself over time
9In this article we have abstracted from the interesting issues arising from asymmetric information, and concentrated our

attention on capturing the competitive interactions.

10Purely for expositional simplicity we have assumed that the investment rate of ﬁrm i is a constant, I . In our numerical
i

implementation of our model, cf. Section 3, it could as well have been a deterministic function of time or even a deterministic
function of the current values of the governing state variables.

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

12

due to technical uncertainty. The more R&D investments the ﬁrm estimates it still has to conduct and the
higher the current R&D investment rate is, the more uncertainty will be revealed per time unit. Moreover,
we assume that these type of technical shocks are independent between the two ﬁrms and also independent
of the demand shocks and the R&D input cost shocks. That is, z 1 and z 2 are independent of each other and
also independent of W y and W k .11 γi is a ﬁrm speciﬁc volatility parameter measuring the size of technical
shocks. The two last terms in equation (2) reﬂect that the estimated remaining R&D investment costs vary
not only because of technical shocks but also because of general uncertainty in the surrounding market, e.g.,
labor costs, input costs to the R&D process, etc. We assume that these input cost shocks are the same for
both ﬁrms; thus it is the same Brownian motion, W k , that enters into both ﬁrms’ estimated remaining R&D
investment cost processes. Moreover, W k may be correlated with W y to reﬂect that the general market
conditions are also related to the demand of the drug.12 That is, we assume
dW y , W k t = ρyk dt.
The drift terms µik and volatility terms σik parameterize the uncertainty in the surrounding market, which
may be diﬀerent for the two ﬁrms. For example, ﬁrm speciﬁc expected increases in labor costs and input
costs over time is parameterized via µik . At date zero when the ﬁrms take out their patents, their estimated
remaining R&D investment costs are of course positive, so Ki0 > 0, i ∈ {1, 2}. The speciﬁcation of the
development of the estimated remaining R&D investment costs from equation (2) is very similar to the
speciﬁcations used in Pindyck (1993), Schwartz and Moon (2000), and Schwartz (2001).13
Schwartz and Moon (2000) and Schwartz (2001) consider also the possibility of catastrophic events. This
reﬂects the fact that besides costs uncertainty and demand uncertainty there is also a risk that the R&D
investment project can simply fail for other reasons independent of how much the ﬁrm invests in it and
independent of how high the demand for the drug will be. It may be that the clinical trials reveal that

11This assumption is not essential, but it simpliﬁes the development of the model.
12Both positive and negative correlations as well as no correlation are economically plausible. A positive correlation could be

explained by a higher than expected demand for the drug if the general economy booms, which would then also lead to higher
than expected input costs to the R&D investment project. This would, e.g., be the case for a drug like Insulin. A negative
correlation could be explained by a higher than expected demand for the drug if the general economy ends up in a recession.
This would be the case for a drug like Prozac. Naturally, there are also cases where there is no connection between the demand
for the drug and the general state of the economy. In our main numerical examples in Section 4 we use a small negative
correlation, but we also perform sensitivity analysis with respect to this correlation parameter.
13It should be pointed out that the models in these articles are formulated as stochastic optimal control problems, whereas
our problem is formulated as an optimal stopping time problem. The optimal solutions to these stochastic optimal control
problems are typically bang-bang solutions and therefore they are very similar to the solution obtained by solving an optimal
stopping time problem. However, the optimal stopping time solution does not allow for costless temporary shut-down of the
R&D investment project. Since we are dealing here with a ﬁnite time horizon, the option to temporary shut down is not
important and, in addition, probably unrealistic for a drug development project.

Figure 3. Illustrative sample paths of the two estimated remaining R&D investment cost
processes, K1 and K2 , from equation (2) for K10 = K20 = 100, I1 = I2 = 10, γ1 = γ2 = 0.2,
µ1k = µ2k = 0, and σ1k = σ2k = 0.1. In these sample paths we have assumed that both R&D
investment projects continue until their corresponding estimated remaining R&D investment
cost processes, K1 and K2 , hit zero. The competitive R&D phase (marked R&D) takes
place in the time period from date zero and until the ﬁrst process hits zero around date
10.6. The monopoly phase (marked M) takes place in the time period from when the ﬁrst
process hits zero around date 10.6 and until the second process hits zero around date 16.6.
Finally, the duopoly phase (marked D) takes place in the time period from when the second
process hits zero around date 16.6 and until the patents expire at date T , which is 20 years
in this example. After date T (20 years) the perfect competition phase (marked PC) takes
over.

the drug has some terrible side eﬀects, it may turn out that it simply is not technically feasible to develop
the drug, it may be that the government prohibits certain classes of drugs, etc. We model this type of
catastrophic events as two Poisson processes, denoted Q1 and Q2 , one for each ﬁrm, with intensities λ1 and
λ2 . These two Poisson processes are independent of each other and also independent of the other three
governing state variables, K1 , K2 , and Y . For tractability we also assume that past and present values of
the Poisson processes, {(Q1s , Q2s )}s∈[0,t] , are public information.
We have depicted illustrative sample paths of the two estimated remaining R&D investment cost processes,
K1 and K2 , in Figure 3 in an example where both ﬁrms are exactly equal (the symmetric case): both ﬁrms
have at date zero estimated remaining R&D investment costs of 100 (K10 = K20 = 100) and both invest

10 per year in R&D (I1 = I2 = 10). Both ﬁrms face technical shock volatility of 20% (γ1 = γ2 = 0.2) and
equal drift and volatility parameters of the input cost shocks to the R&D investment project of zero and 10%
(µ1k = µ2k = 0 and σ1k = σ2k = 0.1). In these sample paths we have assumed that the R&D investment
projects continue until the corresponding estimated remaining R&D investment cost processes, K1 and K2 ,
hit zero. The competitive R&D phase (marked R&D in Figure 3) takes place in the time period from date
zero and until the ﬁrst process hits zero around date 10.6. The monopoly phase (marked M in Figure 3)
takes place in the time period from when the ﬁrst process hits zero around date 10.6 and until the second
process hits zero around date 16.6. Finally, the duopoly phase (marked D in Figure 3) takes place in the
time period from when the second process hits zero around date 16.6 and until the patents expire at date
T , which is 20 years in this example. After date T (20 years) the perfect competition phase (marked PC
in Figure 3) takes over. Cf. Figure 1 for the complete time line of our model. The parameter values used
to create Figure 3 are identical to the ones that we will use in our numerical examples in Section 4. Note
that the four phases of our model, the competitive R&D phase, the monopoly phase, the duopoly phase, and
the perfect competition phase, are deﬁned based solely on the development of the two estimated remaining
cost processes, K1 and K2 . Because of optimal abandonment of the R&D investment project and/or the
occurrence of catastrophic events, it may very well be the case that there is only one ﬁrm (or even no ﬁrms)
producing drugs in the duopoly phase. Similar things can happen in the other phases. The names of the
diﬀerent phases are based on what would have happened if there were no abandonment and the catastrophic
events never occurred. The reader should only use the names of the diﬀerent phases to be able to distinguish
the four phases of the model and not necessarily as a statement of what type of economic activity that will
occur in these phases.
The drug developed by ﬁrm i ∈ {1, 2} is marketed as soon as the corresponding (estimated) remaining
R&D investment cost process, Ki , hits zero unless either an optimal abandonment decision has been taken
earlier on or catastrophic events have occurred to the R&D investment project earlier on.14 In order to keep
track of when this happens we introduce some stopping times.15 Deﬁne τi to reﬂect when ﬁrm i’s product
will be marketed, i ∈ {1, 2}, if its project is still alive, i.e., if neither an optimal abandonment decision has
been taken earlier on nor catastrophic events have occurred to the R&D investment project earlier on. As a

14We place estimated in parentheses because when the (estimated) remaining R&D investments are exactly zero, they are not

just estimates any more, they are truly zero: the drug is ready.

15Formally, a stochastic variable, τ , is a stopping time related to the ﬁltration F if the event {τ ≤ t} ∈ F , for all t ∈ [0, T ].
t

Moreover let S(F) denote the set of all stopping times related to the ﬁltration F. For the rest of the article the ﬁltration F will
be the ﬁltration generated by the governing state variables, i.e. Ft = σ{(Ys , K1s , K2s , Q1s , Q2s )|s ∈ [0, t]}.

ﬁrst attempt we can specify this as
inf{t ≥ 0|Kit = 0}.
However, the patents the ﬁrms take out at date zero have a certain life span, normally twenty years, which
we here denote T . If none of the two ﬁrms have been able to market a drug within that life span, they will
not be able to derive any proﬁts from their R&D eﬀort. There are many possible scenarios leading to that
conclusion. One of them is that if they continue their R&D eﬀort even after date T and eventually market
their drug, an instant later the generics are ready with competing drugs because the patents have already
expired. So they will not be able to derive any proﬁts from their R&D eﬀort. A more likely scenario is the
following: since it would never be optimal to continue the R&D investment projects after date T , the R&D
investment project will be abandoned at date T at the latest, and very likely much earlier. Hence, there will
be no drugs marketed and therefore no generics either. Again, they will not be able to derive any proﬁts
from their R&D eﬀort. Thus, our stopping times are only interesting when they are strictly smaller than
T since there can be derived no proﬁts after date T . That is, we would like to reﬁne our deﬁnition of τi ,
i ∈ {1, 2} to16



τi ≡ min inf{t ≥ 0|Kit = 0}, T .

Hence, the monopoly phase starts at date τ deﬁned as
τ ≡ min{τ1 , τ2 },
and the duopoly phase starts at date τ deﬁned as
τ ≡ max{τ1 , τ2 }.
As long as the ﬁrms are still investing in R&D, they can decide to abandon their R&D investment project if
they ﬁnd that it is not proﬁtable to continue. We will denote the stopping time when the ﬁrms stop investing
in their R&D investment projects for economic reasons by νi , i ∈ {1, 2}.17 Surely, they will stop investing no
later than when their R&D investment project is completed, hence νi ≤ τi . The event {νi = τi } now means
that the ﬁrm did not ﬁnd it optimal to abandon its R&D investment project before completion, whereas

16We do not include the catastrophic events into our stopping times since these are much more eﬃciently dealt with explicitly by

multiplying the relevant expressions with the probability that the catastrophic events will occur under an equivalent martingale
measure, Q.
17We still do not include catastrophic events into our stopping times, cf. footnote no. 16.

the event {νi < τi } means that the ﬁrm did ﬁnd it optimal to abandon its R&D investment project before
completion.18
We are now ready to more formally set up the objectives of the two ﬁrms. Deﬁne the winning ﬁrm as the
ﬁrm which, if its project is alive, markets its drug at the entrance date into the monopoly phase and let w
denote the index of the winning ﬁrm. That is,

w≡




1,

τ1 = τ ,



2,

τ1 = τ .

Moreover, let l denote the index of the losing ﬁrm, i.e., the ﬁrm which, if its project is alive, markets its
drug at the entrance date into the duopoly phase.19 That is,
l ≡ 3 − w.
In order to ﬁnd the values of the two ﬁrms’ R&D investment projects as well as their optimal R&D
investment/abandonment strategies we have to value their projects in all three phases of our model starting
from the last phase, i.e. the duopoly phase. At the entrance date into the duopoly phase there are three
possible situations: there can be either two, one, or no projects alive to be marketed. If there are still two
projects alive to be marketed at the entrance date into the duopoly phase, the ﬁrms will compete in the
usual Cournot fashion. At any given date t in the duopoly phase, i.e. t ∈ [τ , T ), the total value to each of

sense equal to the expected remaining R&D investment costs. That is, in general Kit is not equal to

not even conditional on completion. Clearly this expectation will (among other parameters) depend on µik , T , and λi . In the
model the state variable Kit governs how far the R&D investment project is from completion. The value of Kit is never directly
used as expected remaining R&D costs.
19Note that in the event that the two ﬁrms’ estimated remaining R&D investment cost processes hit zero exactly at the same
instant in time or none of them hit zero before the patent expires at date T , ﬁrm one would be called the winning ﬁrm and ﬁrm
two would be called the losing ﬁrm. But as we will see in the derivation of the objective functions below in these two special
cases, there will be no diﬀerence between the winning ﬁrm’s and the losing ﬁrm’s objective functions. Hence, it does not really
matter which of the two we assign as the winning ﬁrm and which we assign as the losing ﬁrm in these two special cases.

only depend on the value of the state variable Y and the date t. The two state variables measuring the
estimated remaining R&D investment costs, K1 and K2 , are already zero so they are not relevant any more.
The superscript D2 indicates that this is the project value in the duopoly phase if there are still two projects
alive, i.e. if both projects have survived the catastrophic events and none of them have been abandoned for
economic reasons.
If one of the ﬁrms is hit by catastrophic events or if one of the ﬁrms abandons its R&D investment project
prior to the duopoly phase, the other ﬁrm would be able to earn a monopoly proﬁt even in the duopoly
phase. At any given date t in the duopoly phase, i.e. t ∈ [τ , T ], the total value to the surviving ﬁrm of all
cash ﬂows after that date can similarly be derived as

The superscript D1 indicates that this is the surviving project value in the duopoly phase if only one of the
projects is alive.
If none of the two projects are alive in the duopoly phase, obviously no proﬁts will be made and the value
is therefore zero.
20Since we have already developed all our stochastic processes under an equivalent martingale measure, Q, the value of all

future proﬁts and costs can be calculated by just summing (integrating) all the expected cash ﬂows (cash ﬂow rates) discounted
using the riskless interest rate.

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

In the monopoly phase, i.e. from date τ to date τ , the winning ﬁrm makes a monopoly proﬁt (if its project
is still alive) while the losing ﬁrm is (perhaps) still investing in R&D. For this period we will have to separate
the calculations of the values of the two ﬁrms. If the losing ﬁrm’s project is still alive, it is still investing
in R&D and, therefore, it is still exposed to catastrophic events. The conditional probability (under an
equivalent martingale measure, Q) that the losing ﬁrm is hit by catastrophic events during a period from
date t to date s in the monopoly phase, given that its project was alive at date t is 1 − e−λl (s−t) . Similarly,
the conditional probability (under an equivalent martingale measure, Q) that it is not hit by catastrophic
events throughout the period from date t to date s in the monopoly phase, given that its project was alive at
date t is e−λl (s−t) . The winning ﬁrm, on the other hand, is no longer exposed to catastrophic events since it
has already completed its R&D investment project at the entrance date into the monopoly phase. However,
the objective function of the losing ﬁrm depends on whether or not the winning ﬁrm’s project is alive at
the entrance date into the monopoly phase, since this determines whether the losing ﬁrm will be earning
a monopoly or a duopoly proﬁt when its R&D investment project is eventually completed. If the winning
ﬁrm’s project is still alive at the entrance date into the monopoly phase, then, at any given date t in the
monopoly phase, i.e. t ∈ [τ , τ ), the total value to the losing ﬁrm (if its project is alive) of all cash ﬂows after
that date can be derived as

Note that the value will only depend on the value of the state variable Y , the estimated remaining R&D
investment costs for the losing ﬁrm, Kl , and the date t. The state variable measuring the estimated remaining
R&D investment costs for the winning ﬁrm, Kw , is already zero and therefore not relevant any more. The
superscript M 2l indicates that this is the losing ﬁrm’s value in the monopoly phase if the winning ﬁrm’s
project is still alive. Note the two terms in equation (5): the ﬁrst term is the losing ﬁrm’s R&D investment
costs in the monopoly phase after date t and until it is either hit by catastrophic events, it decides to
abandon its R&D investment project, or until its R&D investment project is completed; the second term is

the losing ﬁrm’s share of the duopoly proﬁt in the duopoly phase in the event that the losing ﬁrm is not hit
by catastrophic events in the period from date t and until the entrance date into the duopoly phase and it
does not decide to abandon its R&D investment project before completion. In equation (5) we use a so-called
indicator function of the form 1A , where A is some event. This function takes the value one if the event, A, is
true and zero otherwise. The value in equation (5) is the result of a maximization problem, since the losing
ﬁrm should decide at each instant in time whether to continue investing in R&D or to abandon the R&D
investment project. This decision must at each date be taken based on the available information, i.e. the past
and current values of the governing state variables. That is, the R&D investment/abandonment strategy
must be a stopping time related to the ﬁltration F. We have indicated this restriction in equation (5) by
requiring νl to be a member of the set S(F). Denote the optimal R&D investment/abandonment strategy
for the problem in equation (5) as νlt2∗ . Note that the optimal R&D investment/abandonment strategy
will depend on the valuation date t in the problem in equation (5), i.e., it is the (date t) optimal R&D
investment/abandonment strategy for the rest of the monopoly phase, given that the losing ﬁrm has not
yet abandoned its R&D investment project at date t. The superscript 2∗ indicates that this is the (date t)
optimal R&D investment/abandonment strategy, given that the winning ﬁrm’s project is still alive at that
date.
Intuitively the optimal stopping time problem in equation (5) can be solved by dynamic programming.
The boundary condition is given by the value at the entrance date into the duopoly phase. That is,
(6)

VlM 2l (Yτ , 0, τ ) = V D2 (Yτ , τ ).

The optimal stopping time problem is solved by starting with the boundary condition and then going
backward in time in the usual dynamic programming fashion. That is, we solve for the value of the R&D
investment project at date t (in the monopoly phase) conditional on that we have already solved for the
value at any later date s. Let VlM 2l (Ys , Kls , s) denote the total value at date s in the monopoly phase to
the losing ﬁrm (if its project is still alive) of all cash ﬂows after date s when it follows the optimal stopping
time rule. The value at date t to the losing ﬁrm, if it continues investing in its R&D investment project at
date t, can then (intuitively) be written as

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

20

If V̂lM 2l (Yt , Klt , t) is positive, the losing ﬁrm should continue investing at date t, otherwise it should abandon
its R&D investment project. That is,
(8)



VlM 2l (Yt , Klt , t) = max V̂lM 2l (Yt , Klt , t), 0 .

To make this method rigorous in continuous time, we must derive a partial diﬀerential equation to solve for
V̂lM 2l , assuming that the ﬁrm continues investing, and at each instant in time check whether its value is
non-negative. As soon as it becomes negative, it is time to abandon the R&D investment project. This is
the same as the standard solution method normally applied to value an American option in a Black-Scholes
setting. Details can be found in Appendix A.
If the winning ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive at the entrance date into the monopoly phase,21 then at
any given date t in the monopoly phase, i.e. t ∈ [τ , τ ), the total value to the losing ﬁrm (if its project is
alive) of all cash ﬂows after that date can similarly be derived as

Here the superscript M 1l indicates that this is the losing ﬁrm’s project value in the monopoly phase if the winning ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive. In this case we denote the date t optimal R&D investment/abandonment
strategy for the problem in equation (9) as νlt1∗ . Here the superscript 1∗ indicates that this is the (date t)
optimal R&D investment/abandonment strategy, given that the winning ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive at
that date. This optimal stopping time problem can be solved in the same way as sketched in equation (7).
Details can be found in Appendix A.
In the valuation of the winning ﬁrm’s future cash ﬂows we must take into account both the fact that the
losing ﬁrm is (perhaps) still investing in R&D and is therefore still exposed to catastrophic events, and the
fact that it will follow the just derived optimal R&D investment/abandonment strategy. At any given date

t in the monopoly phase the winning ﬁrm (if its project is alive) can observe whether or not the losing ﬁrm’s
project is still alive. This observation is important for the valuation of the winning ﬁrm’s future cash ﬂows
since this indicates whether there is still uncertainty about whether the losing ﬁrm will eventually complete
its R&D investment project or not. At any given date t in the monopoly phase, i.e. t ∈ [τ , τ ), if the losing

The superscript M 2w indicates that this is the winning ﬁrm’s project value in the monopoly phase if the
losing ﬁrm’s project is still alive. Note the three terms in equation (10): the ﬁrst term is the winning ﬁrm’s
monopoly proﬁt from date t and until the end of the monopoly phase; the second term is the winning ﬁrm’s
share of the duopoly proﬁt in the duopoly phase in the event that the losing ﬁrm is not hit by catastrophic
events in the period from date t and until the entrance date into the duopoly phase and the losing ﬁrm
does not abandon its R&D investment project before completion; ﬁnally the third term is the winning ﬁrm’s
monopoly proﬁt in the duopoly phase in the event that the losing ﬁrm is either hit by catastrophic events
before the entrance date into the duopoly phase or the losing ﬁrm ﬁnds it optimal to abandon its R&D
investment project before completion.

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

22

Finally, if the losing ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive, the winning ﬁrm will be able to make a monopoly
proﬁt until its patent expires. Hence, we can value its proﬁt in the same way as in the duopoly phase. That
is, at any given date t in the monopoly phase, i.e. t ∈ [τ , τ ), if the losing ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive at
that date, the total value to the winning ﬁrm of all cash ﬂows after that date can be derived as,

even though, strictly speaking, V D1 is not deﬁned to be used in the monopoly phase. Note that the value
will only depend on the value of the state variable Y , and the date t. The state variable measuring the
estimated remaining R&D investment costs for the losing ﬁrm, Kl , is no longer relevant since that ﬁrm has
either been hit by catastrophic events or has abandoned its R&D investment project before completion. The
superscript M 1w indicates that this is the winning ﬁrm’s project value in the monopoly phase if the losing
ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive.
In the competitive R&D phase before any of the two drugs are marketed, i.e. from date zero to date τ , the
two ﬁrms are competing to market their drug before the competitor markets its drug. Therefore, the actual
R&D investment/abandonment decision itself is somewhat trickier in this phase. In the monopoly phase
there was no element of competitive interaction between the two ﬁrms in the R&D investment decision itself:
the losing ﬁrm simply considers, given that the winning ﬁrm is already making a monopoly (production)
proﬁt in the monopoly phase, whether it is more proﬁtable to continue investing in R&D or whether it is
more proﬁtable to abandon its R&D investment project. In the competitive R&D phase, when both ﬁrms
are still investing in R&D, there is a competitive interaction element to the R&D investment/abandonment
strategy. There is a clear advantage to the ﬁrm which markets its drug before its competitor. Moreover,
it may very well be the case that the value to one of the ﬁrms of all future cash ﬂows is negative, if the
other ﬁrm continues investing in R&D, but positive if the other ﬁrm abandons its R&D investment project.
Hence, the R&D investment/abandonment strategy may not only depend on the valuation of the ﬁrm’s own
R&D investment project. That is, we will have to use the same kind of reasoning in order to ﬁnd the optimal
R&D investment/abandonment strategies for both of the ﬁrms as we did in the derivation of the duopoly
production rates, i.e., a Cournot-Nash type equilibrium. Therefore, we must investigate at any given date t
the two ﬁrms’ response functions in terms of their date t optimal R&D investment/abandonment decision, as
a reaction to their competitor’s given date t R&D investment/abandonment decision. To solve that problem
we ﬁrst need to know the date t value of the project as well as the optimal R&D investment strategy if the
other ﬁrm is hit by catastrophic events or if it abandons its R&D investment project for economic reasons.

This is a standard optimal stopping time problem that can be solved by the same methods as applied for the
losing ﬁrm in the monopoly phase. That is, at any given date t in the competitive R&D phase, i.e. t ∈ [0, τ ),
if the other ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive, the total value to ﬁrm i of all cash ﬂows after that date can be

In equation (12) we have exploited the fact that V D1 and V M 1w are identical, even though, strictly speaking,
they are not deﬁned on the same time intervals, cf. equation (11). Note that the value will only depend on
the value of the state variable Y , the estimated remaining R&D investment costs for the ﬁrm itself, Ki , and
the date t. The state variables measuring the estimated remaining R&D investment costs for the competing
ﬁrm, Kj , for j = 3 − i, is no longer relevant since that ﬁrm has either been hit by catastrophic events or has
abandoned its R&D investment project before completion. The superscript R&D1 indicates that this is the
project value in the competitive R&D phase if the other ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive. Note the two terms
in equation (12): the ﬁrst term is ﬁrm i’s R&D investment costs from date t and until it is either hit by
catastrophic events, it decides to abandon its R&D investment project, or until its R&D investment project
is completed; the second term is ﬁrm i’s monopoly proﬁt in the event that its project is completed. In this
case we denote the date t optimal R&D investment/abandonment strategy for the problem in equation (12)
1∗
. Again the superscript 1∗ indicates that this is the (date t) optimal R&D investment/abandonment
as νit

strategy, given that the other ﬁrm’s project is no longer alive at that date. This optimal stopping time
problem can be solved in the same way as sketched in equation (7). Details can be found in Appendix A.
Now that we know the date t value of ﬁrm i’s R&D investment project if the other ﬁrm decides to abandon
its R&D investment project, we need to derive the date t value of ﬁrm i’s R&D investment project if the
other ﬁrm continues investing in its R&D investment project in order to ﬁnd the best response function.
In order to derive the date t value of ﬁrm i’s R&D investment project if the other ﬁrm continues investing
in its R&D investment project, we must take into account both the fact that both ﬁrms are exposed to
catastrophic events and the fact that both ﬁrms follow R&D investment strategies that are Cournot-Nash
equilibria at any later date s ≥ t in the competitive R&D phase. Therefore, in the case where both ﬁrms are
still investing in their R&D investment projects, we cannot just write the objective function of ﬁrm i at date
t as a simple optimal stopping time problem as we have done in the monopoly phase for the losing ﬁrm and
in the competitive R&D phase when there is only one project left. Because of the competitive interactions

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

24

we are only able to derive the objective function as a solution to a dynamic programming problem. If both
projects are alive in the competitive R&D phase, the boundary conditions for the project values are given
by the value at the entrance date into the monopoly phase. That is,22
VwR&D2 (Yτ , Klτ , 0, τ ) = VwM 2w (Yτ , Klτ , τ )

(13)

and
VlR&D2 (Yτ , Klτ , 0, τ ) = VlM 2l (Yτ , Klτ , τ ).

(14)

The valuation problem in the competitive R&D phase is then solved by going backward in time in the usual
dynamic programming fashion. That is, we solve for the value of the R&D investment project at date t (in
the competitive R&D phase) conditional on that we have already solved for the value at any later date s.
Let ViR&D2 (Ys , K1s , K2s , s) denote the total value to ﬁrm i at date s of all cash ﬂows after date s in the
competitive R&D phase if both projects are still alive and both ﬁrms follow R&D investment strategies that
are Cournot-Nash equilibria at any later date u ≥ s in the competitive R&D phase. From equation (12) we
have, in addition, derived the total value at date s in the competitive R&D phase to ﬁrm i of all cash ﬂows
after date s when it follows the optimal stopping time rule in the case where the other ﬁrm abandons its R&D
investment project. This value is denoted ViR&D1 (Ys , Kis , s). The total value at date t in the competitive
R&D phase to ﬁrm i (if its project is still alive) of all cash ﬂows after date t, if both ﬁrms continue investing
in their R&D investment projects at date t, can then (intuitively) be written as
V̂iR&D2 (Yt , K1t , K2t , t) = E Q −e−(r+λi )dt Ii dt

The superscript R&D2 indicates that this is the ﬁrm’s value in the competitive R&D phase if the other
ﬁrm’s project is still alive.

22In this derivation of the boundary conditions we have implicitly assumed that ﬁrm two is the winning ﬁrm and that ﬁrm one

is the losing ﬁrm. If the opposite situation is the case, then Klτ and zero should be interchanged in the arguments of both
V R&D2 s on the left hand sides of the equations.

Table 1. Normal form representation of the R&D investment game with competitive interactions between the two ﬁrms at date t in the competitive R&D phase. The table contains
the date t value to each of the two duopolists of all future cash ﬂows after that date (ﬁrm
one’s value before the comma and ﬁrm two’s value after the comma) given that both ﬁrms
follow the decisions indicated in the margin of the box at date t and that both ﬁrms follow
R&D investment strategies that are Cournot-Nash equilibria at any later date s ≥ t in the
competitive R&D phase.

To ﬁnd the Cournot-Nash type equilibrium R&D investment/abandonment decisions at date t for the two
ﬁrms in the competitive R&D phase, we will have to consider the game in Table 1. Table 1 contains the date t
value to each of the two duopolists of all future cash ﬂows after that date (ﬁrm one’s value before the comma
and ﬁrm two’s value after the comma) given that both ﬁrms follow the decisions indicated in the margin of
the box at date t and that both ﬁrms follow R&D investment strategies that are Cournot-Nash equilibria at
any later date s ≥ t in the competitive R&D phase. Take, e.g., the upper right corner of the box in Table 1.
The two numbers, V1R&D1 (Yt , K1t , t), 0, indicate that if ﬁrm one continues investing in its R&D investment
project and ﬁrm two abandons its R&D investment project, then the value of all future cash ﬂows to ﬁrm one
would be V1R&D1 (Yt , K1t , t), whereas the value of all future cash ﬂows to ﬁrm two would be zero. Naturally,
V̂iR&D2 (Yt , K1t , K2t , t) < ViR&D1 (Yt , Kit , t), for both i = 1 and i = 2, i.e., the value to ﬁrm i of all future
cash ﬂows if it continues investing in R&D is lower if the other ﬁrm also continues investing in R&D than if
the other ﬁrm abandons its R&D investment project, ceteris paribus. If V̂iR&D2 (Yt , K1t , K2t , t) ≥ 0, for both
i = 1 and i = 2, there is a unique Nash equilibrium in simple strategies. This equilibrium is that both ﬁrms
continue investing. If, for one i, V̂iR&D2 (Yt , K1t , K2t , t) ≥ 0 and V̂jR&D2 (Yt , K1t , K2t , t) < 0, for j = 3 − i,
then the unique Nash equilibrium in simple strategies is that ﬁrm i continues investing in R&D, whereas
ﬁrm j = 3 − i abandons its R&D investment project. If ViR&D1 (Yt , Kit , t) < 0, for both i = 1 and i = 2,
then the unique Nash equilibrium in simple strategies is that both ﬁrms abandon their R&D investment
projects. If, for one i, ViR&D1 (Yt , Kit , t) ≥ 0 and VjR&D1 (Yt , Kjt , t) < 0, for j = 3 − i, then the unique Nash
equilibrium in simple strategies is that ﬁrm i continues investing in R&D, whereas ﬁrm j = 3 − i abandons
its R&D investment project. Finally, if ViR&D1 (Yt , Kit , t) ≥ 0 and V̂iR&D2 (Yt , K1t , K2t , t) < 0, for both i = 1
and i = 2, then there are multiple Nash equilibria in simple strategies. It is a Nash equilibrium in simple
strategies that one of the ﬁrms continues investing in R&D and the other abandons its R&D investment

project. The question is how the two ﬁrms should select a rule for which of the two ﬁrms should continue
investing in R&D and which of them should abandon its R&D investment project. Any rule that given
the information set available to the two ﬁrms unambiguously selects which of the two ﬁrms should continue
investing in R&D and which of them should abandon its R&D investment project is a Nash equilibrium. In
our numerical solution procedure presented in Section 3 we have implemented the rule that the ﬁrm with
the highest value of continuing investing in R&D, given that the other ﬁrm abandons its R&D investment
project, continues investing in R&D, and the other ﬁrm abandons its R&D investment project. In the
zero-probability event that both ﬁrms have identical values of continuing investing in R&D, given that the
other ﬁrm abandons its R&D investment project, we say that ﬁrm two continues investing in R&D and
ﬁrm one abandons its R&D investment project.23 That is, we have implemented the rule that it is ﬁrm
one which continues investing in R&D and ﬁrm two which abandons its R&D investment project if and
only if V1R&D1 (Yt , K1t , t) > V2R&D1 (Yt , K2t , t). This Nash equilibrium among all Nash equilibria is the one
that gives the highest ex ante values of the two ﬁrms’ projects and therefore it should be the one Nash
equilibrium that both ﬁrms would prefer to play. One economic motivation for this reﬁnement criterion is
a story related to mutual threads of war of attrition.24 First of all we can think of the two ﬁrms as the
two opponents of a potential war of attrition. Firm i’s gain from winning this war of attrition by forcing
ﬁrm j = 3 − i to abandon its R&D investment project at date t is ViR&D1 (Yt , Kit , t). Both ﬁrms know their
own and their opponent’s potential gains from winning this war of attrition. Since the value of losing the
potential war of attrition is zero, ViR&D1 (Yt , Kit , t) can also be interpreted as the maximum amount that
ﬁrm i would be willing to spend in order to win this war of attrition. Faced with these facts we ﬁnd it
plausible that the ﬁrm with the lowest value of V R&D1 voluntarily abandons its R&D investment project
without even starting the war of attrition. This implies that the ﬁrm with the highest value of V R&D1
can continue its R&D investment project as a monopolist without having to spend any money to win the
war of attrition. It is also possible to think about this reﬁnement in terms of mergers and acquisitions. In
these cases the equilibrium outcome would be the same, i.e. the ﬁrm with the highest value of V R&D1 will
continue its R&D investment project and the other ﬁrm would abandon its R&D project, but typically a
Nash bargaining game would be involved and there would be a wealth transfer from the ﬁrm with the highest
value of V R&D1 to the ﬁrm with the lowest value of V R&D1 . In this case there could also be an increase in
23Since we assume that both projects are identical at date zero, i.e. we are working with symmetric ﬁrms, this event happens

with probability one at date zero when the projects are marginal. This means that whenever it is not optimal for both duopolists
to initiate their R&D investment projects at date zero, only ﬁrm two would initiate its R&D investment project and we will de
facto have a monopoly situation.
24Other articles that consider wars of attrition in duopoly situations are Ghemawat and Nalebuﬀ (1985), Fudenberg and Tirole
(1986), and Lambrecht (2001).

value to above the highest value of V R&D1 if the two R&D investment projects can be combined in some way
as a result of a merger or an acquisition. Finally, there is also a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies. For
comparison we have also implemented this rule in our numerical solution procedure presented in Section 3.
This equilibrium is that ﬁrm i = 3−j continues investing with probability
and abandons with probability 1 −

, for both ﬁrms i = 1 and i = 2. Note

that ViR&D1 (Yt , Kit , t) ≥ 0 and V̂iR&D2 (Yt , K1t , K2t , t) < 0, for both i = 1 and i = 2, such that the
probabilities for continuing investing are positive and strictly less than one. This alternative equilibrium,
while theoretically appealing in the sense that it provides the same value (namely zero) to both projects at
date t, does not provide the highest ex-ante value for the projects. Hence, we have found the Cournot-Nash
type equilibrium investment decisions for date t. The date t values for each of the two projects corresponding
to the outcome of this Cournot-Nash type investment game can then be assigned to V1R&D2 and V2R&D2 ,
cf. equations (16) and (17) in Appendix B. This last step replaces equation (8) in the optimal stopping
time problem. To make this method rigorous in continuous time we must derive two partial diﬀerential
equations to solve for V̂1R&D2 and V̂2R&D2 assuming that both ﬁrms continue investing, and at each instant
in time check that it is a Nash equilibrium for both ﬁrms to continue investing. As soon as one of the other
three outcomes of the game becomes a Nash equilibrium the competitive interactions come to an end and
the corresponding values from equation (12) can be substituted in as a boundary condition. Details can be
found in Appendix B.
The way to solve for the date zero Cournot-Nash type equilibrium R&D investment/abandonment strategies for the two ﬁrms is to successively solve for Nash equilibria in the game in Table 1 at each instant in time,
starting with equations (13) and (14) at the entrance date into the monopoly phase and going backwards in
time using equation (15) until date zero.
3. Numerical Solution Procedure
We solve the model numerically by applying a variation of the Longstaﬀ-Schwartz method (Longstaﬀ and
Schwartz 2001). This is done by ﬁrst simulating 100,000 discretizised25 sample paths of the three governing
state variables Y , K1 , and K2 . It is then easy to determine the two stopping times τ and τ for each sample
path, cf. Figure 3. The value of all future proﬁts to each of the two ﬁrms can easily be calculated at date τ by
equations (3) and (4) in both the case where the ﬁrm will be the only one on the market, i.e. a monopolist, and
in the case where the ﬁrms will be sharing the market, i.e. duopolists. The reason that we have to calculate
25In our implementation we have used a discretization based on three-month intervals. That is, we have separated the twenty-

year time period, [0, T ], into 80 quarters.

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

28

both proﬁt values is that we do not know if and when one of the two ﬁrms will abandon its R&D investment
project or if and when it may be hit by catastrophic events. The losing ﬁrm’s value in the monopoly phase
is, however, a little bit more problematic in that it involves the R&D investment/abandonment decision,
cf. equations (5) and (9). The value of the losing ﬁrm, at any given date in the monopoly phase, of all
future cash ﬂows, if the ﬁrm continues investing in R&D, can be approximated by the following backward
procedure similar in spirit to equation (7): regress the continuation value along each of the sample paths
which are in the monopoly phase at the same date on a speciﬁc function of the current values along the
corresponding sample paths of the two governing state variables, Kl and Y . The regression coeﬃcients from
this regression is used to approximate the value, at this date in the monopoly phase, of all future cash ﬂows,
if the ﬁrm continues investing in R&D, simply by applying the regression to the current values of the two
governing state variables.26 If the value of continuing investing in R&D is greater than the costs of investing
in R&D for another quarter, the ﬁrm should continue investing in R&D, otherwise it should abandon its
R&D investment project. This procedure gives us the value of all future cash ﬂows for the losing ﬁrm back
to date τ as well as the ﬁrm’s R&D investment/abandonment decisions along each sample path for each
quarter in the monopoly phase both in the case where both projects are alive and in the case where there
is only one project alive. With the losing ﬁrm’s R&D investment/abandonment decisions along each sample
path for each quarter in the monopoly phase it is quite easy to calculate the winning ﬁrm’s value of all future
proﬁts at date τ by equations (10) and (11).
In the competitive R&D phase, the same method is applied to approximate the value of all future cash
ﬂows, given the current value of the (now three) governing state variables, K1 , K2 and Y , cf. equation (15).
However, as we saw in Section 2 the actual R&D investment/abandonment decision is somewhat more tricky
in this situation as we, for each quarter, have to go through the game in Table 1 to ﬁnd the Nash equilibrium
R&D investment/abandonment decisions based on the values from equations (12) and (15). Note that in
the case where we allow for mixed strategies the investment/abandonment decision is not just an eitheror decision (either the ﬁrm continues investing in its R&D project, or it abandons its project), the mixed
strategy is implemented as a probability of continuing to invest.

26The Longstaﬀ-Schwartz method exploits the fact that the continuation value, i.e. the date t value of all future cash ﬂows from

the R&D investment project if the ﬁrm continues investing in R&D (including the option to abandon later on), is simply the
date t conditional expectation of the value of the true future cash ﬂows from the R&D investment project under an equivalent
martingale measure, Q. Since the current date t value of the two governing state variables is a suﬃcient statistic of all date t
information, it follows that the conditional expectation under Q is some (unknown) function of the current realized values of
the two governing state variables. It is this unknown function that we try to approximate/estimate at each instant in time.
This is done by estimating ten coeﬃcients in a cubic polynomial parameterization of the function.

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

29

When this backward procedure is carried out starting from date T = 20 and quarter by quarter going
backwards through the duopoly phase, the monopoly phase, and the competitive R&D phase back to date
zero, all the R&D investment/abandonment decisions (possible as mixed strategies) for the two ﬁrms have
been determined for each quarter and for each of the 100,000 sample paths, both in the case where there are
still two projects alive and in the case where there is only one project alive. The actual values of all future
cash ﬂows from continuing the R&D investment project which are the results of the regressions that has been
run are not used in the computation of the value of the projects, only the R&D investment/abandonment
decisions they have caused are used.
In order to value the R&D investment projects for the two ﬁrms at date zero we implement a forward
procedure that ﬁnds the value by evaluating the proﬁt along each sample path taking into account the R&D
investment/abandonment decisions (possible as mixed strategies) derived by the backward procedure and
averaging over all the sample paths.

4. Numerical Results
In this section we provide a numerical illustration of the model. Since we solve the problem using numerical
simulations, we are able to characterize the solution in great detail. We ﬁrst develop a base case and then
we perform sensitivity analysis with respect to some of the key parameters of the model. We emphasize the
diﬀerences between competitive (duopoly) and monopoly solutions to the R&D investment project. We have
two diﬀerent competitive solutions: one using the war of attrition reﬁnement and one using mixed strategies
and also two diﬀerent monopoly solutions: one where the monopolist only has access to project one and one
where the monopolist has access to both projects.
Table 2 contains the data for the base case. The inverse demand function parameters are the same as
the ones used to construct Figure 2. Note that parameter a is a measure of the size of the market for the
product and that parameter b is a measure of the depth of the market, i.e., a measure for how much the
price would change for a given change in supplied quantity. The R&D investment cost parameters are the
ones used to construct the sample paths in Figure 3. The other parameters are chosen to represent a typical
drug development project (Schwartz 2001).
The results of the numerical simulations for the base case are shown in Table 3. As expected the value of
the R&D investment project in the monopoly situation is higher than the sum of the values of the two R&D
investment projects in the duopoly situation. The monopolist not only optimizes its production rate after
completion of the R&D investment project in order to maximize its own per period production proﬁts, but it

also uses an optimal R&D investment/abandonment strategy during the period of R&D investments without
having to consider competitive interactions. In the base case it turns out not to be optimal to initiate a
backup project.27 Hence, the results are identical for the monopolist who has access only to project one and
for the monopolist who has access to both projects. Note that the present value of the revenues generated
during the production period is 27% higher in the duopoly situation than in the monopoly situation even
though on average the price per unit sold is lower in the duopoly situation than in the monopoly situation.
27

In fact, it turns out only to be optimal for a monopolist to initiate the backup project for very proﬁtable R&D investment
projects. In our numerical examples this only happens when a = 17.5 or higher, cf. Figure 4 below.

This is due to the fact that, on average, the total number of units produced is 36% higher in the duopoly
situation than in the monopoly situation. There are three reasons, all working in the same direction, for this
higher production in the duopoly situation. Firstly, there is a higher probability that a product is developed
in the duopoly situation than in the monopoly situation since (i) catastrophic events are diversiﬁed over
the two duopolists and (ii) the R&D investment costs for the winning duopoly ﬁrm are on average smaller
than the R&D investment costs for the monopoly ﬁrm because the winning duopoly ﬁrm typically has the
estimated remaining R&D investment cost process which hits zero ﬁrst. Secondly, on average the time to
completion for the ﬁrst product is shorter in the duopoly situation than in the monopoly situation so there
is a longer time period to produce before the patents expire. Thirdly, in those cases where both duopolists
complete their R&D investment projects, the production rate is higher after the second ﬁrm completes its
R&D investment project (see ﬁgure 2). The ﬂip side of the beneﬁts of having more units produced in the
duopoly situation is that the total present value of the R&D investment costs is higher in the duopoly
situation than in the monopoly situation. Even on a per unit basis the present value of the R&D investment
costs is higher in the duopoly situation than in the monopoly situation, since there is a duplication of the
R&D investment costs. The results are practically identical for the two diﬀerent implemented reﬁnements
of the duopoly situation. Practically it does not matter for this case whether the duopolists play mixed
strategies or play a war of attrition game. Therefore, in the following we will only report on the duopoly
results with war of attrition reﬁnements. We will, however, comment on the results related to duopoly
with mixed strategies when there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the results when using war of attrition
reﬁnement and mixed strategies.

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

32

Now let us turn to the analysis of the probabilities of abandonment.28 The probability of abandonment of
the R&D investment project because it is no longer proﬁtable to continue investing (economic abandonment)
for each of the two duopolists is much larger (50.8–51.0%) than it is for the monopolist (32.3%), since the
expected future cash ﬂows to each of the two duopolists are smaller. A consequence of this is that on
average the life time of an R&D investment project initiated by a duopolist is shorter than the life time of
an R&D investment project initiated by a monopolist, and therefore the probability of catastrophic events is
smaller for a given R&D investment project if it is initiated by a duopolist (24.3–24.4%) than if it is initiated
by a monopolist (33.5%). The outcome of these two opposing eﬀects is that, on a per project basis, the
probability of completion of the R&D investment project is higher if the R&D investment project is initiated
by a monopolist than if it is initiated by a duopolist. If we take into account that there are two duopolists,
each with an R&D investment project; however, the probability that at least one of the two duopolists will
complete is higher (43.3–43.4%) than the probability that the monopolist will complete (34.3%). Finally, in
our base case, the probability that both duopolists complete is only 5.6%. That is, the conditional probability
that the second duopolist completes, conditional on the ﬁrst completing, is only 22.3–22.6%, which is lower
than the unconditional probability that a given duopolist will complete (24.7–24.8%).
In summary, if we only take into account the value of the R&D investment projects, the monopoly
situation is the superior alternative for society. But, if society’s objective criteria include the number of
units produced, the price per unit produced, the time to complete the R&D investment project, and the
probability of successful completion, the duopoly situation may very well be the superior alternative. Note
that these beneﬁts of the duopoly situation came about not only because of the lower price charged when
both duopolists are producing, but also because of the fact that the chance of completion is higher and the
expected time to completion of the ﬁrst R&D investment project is shorter. These results are robust to
most of the numerical simulations we have performed. Only when the R&D investment projects are very
marginal will monopoly induce higher probability of successful completion and thereby a higher number of
units produced than duopoly with mixed strategies. If the duopolists are playing war of attrition, the results
are identical to the monopoly case since the R&D investment projects are so marginal that one of the two
duopolists abandon at date zero.
To get to a deeper understanding of the insights of the model, we now perturb some of the key parameters
of the model and analyze their impact, for both the duopoly and monopoly situations, on valuation, number
of units produced, and probabilities of completion. We ﬁrst analyze the sensitivity to the size of the market.

Note that these are risk neutral probabilities since we have only developed the stochastic processes under an equivalent

The parameter a of the inverse demand function captures the number of units demanded for a given price
or the price that can be charged for a given quantity produced.29 We vary a from 11.5 up to 20 in Figure 4.
When a = 11.5, the market is so small that it is not optimal to initiate the R&D investment project even
in the monopoly situation, so that the value of the R&D investment project is zero, the number of units
produced is zero, and the probability of (economic) abandonment is 100%. When a = 12, 12.5, or 13, it is
optimal for the monopolist to initiate the R&D investment project, but the market is still not large enough
to make it optimal for both of the duopolists to initiate their R&D investment projects. However, according
to the rules of the R&D investment game given by our choice of reﬁnement criterion in the competitive R&D
phase, cf. Table 1 in Section 2, in this situation one of the ﬁrms’ (ﬁrm two’s) R&D investment projects is
initiated and the other ﬁrm’s (ﬁrm one’s) R&D investment project is immediately abandoned. Thus, the
duopoly (with war of attrition reﬁnement) and monopoly situations are identical when a = 12, 12.5, or 13.
With mixed strategies both duopolists initiate their R&D investment projects at date zero when a = 12,
12.5, or 13, cf. Figure 5 for comparison between the two diﬀerent reﬁnements in the duopoly situation. When
a is 13.5 or higher, both duopolists initiate their R&D investment projects at date zero and the diﬀerences
between the duopoly and monopoly situations start arising. The scenario when a = 15 corresponds to the
base case discussed in detail above, cf. Table 3.
Figure 4(a) shows that as the size of the market increases, the values of the R&D investment projects
in both the duopoly and the monopoly situations increase, but the R&D investment project values in the
monopoly situation (solid line) increase more than in the duopoly situation (dashed line) such that the
absolute diﬀerence between the monopoly and the duopoly situations also increases. Figure 4(b) shows that
the number of units produced also increases with the market size. The increase is, however, stronger for
the duopoly situation (dashed line) than for the monopoly situation (solid line). The three reasons for a
larger production in the duopoly situation than in the monopoly situation mentioned above get stronger
the larger the size of the market. This is because as the demand increases, the better the projects are, and
therefore the later will one of the duopolists eventually abandon for economic reasons. This implies that the
diversiﬁcation eﬀects and the eﬀect that one of the duopolists completes on average earlier are increased, and
at the same time the probability that both of the duopolists complete increases. In Figure 4(d) we present
the present values of the R&D investment costs per unit produced and the present value of revenues per
units produced for both the duopoly and monopoly situations. As the size of the market increases, the price
29Our speciﬁcation of the demand function is such that the optimal quantity produced both in the monopoly and duopoly

situations is independent of a, such that there is only a price eﬀect when the size of the market is changed. Note, however, that
there is an indirect eﬀect on the quantity produced since, as the price increases, on average more R&D investment projects are
completed, which implies a higher average number of units produced.

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

per unit sold also increases, and then also the present value of the revenue per unit produced will increase
in both the monopoly (dashed-dotted line) and the duopoly (dotted line) situations. As the present value
of revenues per unit produced increases, the ﬁrms are willing to incur more R&D investment costs per unit
produced in order to obtain these per unit revenues. Hence, also the present value of R&D investment costs
per unit produced increases in both the monopoly (solid line) and the duopoly (dashed line) situations. The
two inner curves correspond to the duopoly situation and the two outer curves correspond to the monopoly
situation. The diﬀerence between the two inner curves and the diﬀerence between the two outer curves are
the R&D investment project values per unit produced to the duopolist and monopolist, respectively. The
probabilities of completion are depicted in Figure 4(c). As we can see, both the probability that at least one
of the duopolists completes (dashed line) and the probability that both of the duopolists complete (dotted
line) increase with market size in absolute terms as well as relative to the monopoly situation (solid line).
Figure 5 shows that when a is 13.5 or higher there is practically no diﬀerence between the two diﬀerent
reﬁnements in the duopoly situation. The value of the R&D investment projects will always be highest with
the war of attrition reﬁnement, since this reﬁnement is the one with the highest ex-ante values. A closer
look at Figure 5(a) shows that the values with war of attrition reﬁnement (dashed line) is higher than the
values with mixed strategies reﬁnement (solid line) even for values of a at 13.5 or higher, most signiﬁcantly
for a = 13.5 and a = 14.0 when the chances for scenarios where the distinction actually matters are the
highest. It is interesting to see that when the R&D investment projects are very marginal, i.e. for a = 12,
the probability of completion as well as the number of units produced are higher for the duopoly situation
with war of attrition reﬁnement (which for this case is de facto a monopoly situation) than for the duopoly
situation with mixed strategies. Already for a = 12.5 the probabilities of completion and the number of
units produced become almost equal. For a = 13 the mixed strategy reﬁnement gives signiﬁcantly higher
probabilities of completion, more units produced, and lower price per unit produced. This is because when
the projects are very marginal the probabilities of continuing investing for each of the two ﬁrms with the
mixed strategy reﬁnement is low. However, when the projects are a little better (but still marginal) the
mixed strategy reﬁnement gives a higher probability that each of the projects will be completed and there
is even a small chance that both projects will be completed, cf. Figure 5(c).
The intensity of catastrophic events, λ, measures the probability per unit of time that the value of the
R&D investment projects will vanish due to unforeseen external circumstances and thereby quantiﬁes how
challenging the R&D investment projects are. An increase in the value of λ clearly decreases the value of the
R&D investment projects both in the duopoly and monopoly situations, but it also increases the advantage

that diversiﬁcation has on the R&D investment project values in the duopoly situation compared to the
monopoly situation. In Figure 6 we vary λ for both ﬁrms (λ = λ1 = λ2 ) from zero (no catastrophic events)
up to 0.10. When λ = 0.10, we get the same scenario as explained above where the R&D investment project
is so marginal that only one of the two duopolists would optimally initiate investment in the R&D investment
project, and therefore the results for the monopoly and duopoly situations are identical in this scenario. (It
is also the case here that this is the only value of λ where there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two
diﬀerent reﬁnements in the duopoly case.) For all other values of λ in Figure 6 we get that both duopolists
optimally initiate their investment in the R&D investment project at date zero. Recall that in the base case
λ = 0.07. Keep in mind that for this analysis we maintain the inverse demand function ﬁxed, so that all
the results are due to the eﬀect that the catastrophic events have on the completion of the R&D investment
projects. Figure 6(a) shows that the value of the R&D investment projects in the monopoly situation (solid
line) is more than twice what it is in the duopoly situation (dashed line) for λ = 0; this is mostly because
the duopolists incur much higher R&D investment costs without getting the beneﬁts of the diversiﬁcation
of the catastrophic events (since there are no catastrophic events). But when λ increases, the value of the
R&D investment project in the monopoly situation (solid line) decreases much faster than the value of the
R&D investment projects in the duopoly situation (dashed line) mainly due to the increased diversiﬁcation
of catastrophic events in the duopoly situation. In Figure 6(b) we see that the number of units produced
decreases as λ increases in both situations. However, the relative diﬀerence between the number of units
produced in the monopoly situation (solid line) and in the duopoly situation (dashed line) is smaller than
the relative diﬀerence between the values of the R&D investment projects because the R&D investment
duplication eﬀect does not directly inﬂuence the number of units produced.
Figure 6(d) illustrates the eﬀect of λ on the present value of revenues and the present value of R&D
investment costs per unit produced for both the monopoly and the duopoly situations. The present value
of revenues per unit produced increases in both the monopoly (dashed-dotted line) and the duopoly (dotted
line) situations because as λ increases, the R&D investment projects become more and more marginal and
the threshold level of the demand shocks for abandonment becomes higher, ceteris paribus. Hence, as λ
increases the average price conditional on production occurring also increases. R&D investment costs per
unit produced also increase both in the monopoly (solid line) and the duopoly (dashed line) situations
because since the revenues per unit produced are higher, the ﬁrm is willing to incur higher R&D investment
costs per unit produced, but they even go up faster than the revenues per unit produced so that the project
values per unit produced go down. In Figure 6(c) we observe that the probabilities of completion decrease

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

39

as λ increases. As a measure of the catastrophic events diversiﬁcation eﬀect we compute the conditional
probability that a monopolist would complete, given that at least one of the duopolists completes (dasheddotted line). Since the conditional probabilities decrease, the advantage of diversiﬁcation increases. This
continues until the last value of λ, where the monopoly and duopoly situations are identical so in this case
there is no diversiﬁcation eﬀect. Even for λ = 0 there is a small diversiﬁcation eﬀect due to the fact that
on average the surviving duopolist would be the one with the lowest realized R&D investment costs; i.e. the
duopolist with the estimated remaining R&D investment cost process that hits zero ﬁrst.
Figure 7 analyzes the eﬀects of changing the correlation between demand shocks and the input cost
shocks. As mentioned earlier this correlation will depend on the type of product being considered. We
change the correlation between −0.3 and +0.3. The base case has ρyk = −0.1. Clearly, the more negative
the correlation is, the better the R&D investment projects are since this implies a higher probability that,
when R&D investment costs turn out to be low, demand is high and vice versa. De facto this gives a higher
volatility of the cash ﬂows. A simple option argument implies that this results in higher values for the R&D
investment projects, higher number of units produced, and higher probabilities of completion in both the
monopoly and duopoly situations. In addition, a more negative correlation implies that on average higher
demand shocks for the cases that are completed and therefore a higher on average revenue per unit produced
both in the monopoly (dashed-dotted line) and the duopoly (dotted line) situations, cf. Figure 7(d).
Up to now we have concentrated on analyzing the eﬀect of competition on patent-protected R&D investment projects for the case where both duopolists are identical. Now we look at a particular case of
asymmetry which highlights a new angle of competition between the duopolists. In Figure 8 we change the
level of technical shocks for ﬁrm two, γ2 , from 0.1 to 0.3 while keeping constant ﬁrm one’s technical shocks
at γ1 = 0.2 as well as all other parameters. Figure 8 reports the valuation results of this exercise. First
note the value of the R&D investment project for a monopolist when its technical shocks change (dotted
line). As expected, higher uncertainty increases the value of the R&D investment project. This result follows
from standard real option arguments. The corresponding duopoly ﬁrm value (solid line) grows faster with
uncertainty than does the value of the corresponding monopoly ﬁrm in percentage terms. For the lowest
uncertainty in the ﬁgure, γ2 = 0.1, it is not optimal for ﬁrm two to initiate the R&D investment project
and therefore its value is zero. Most interesting, the value of ﬁrm one’s project (dashed line) decreases
dramatically. Recall that for this ﬁrm all parameters have been kept constant. We can see here that changes
in the other ﬁrm’s technical uncertainty have a big impact on this ﬁrm’s value, and all of this impact is due
to the competitive interactions between the ﬁrms. At γ2 = 0.1, because ﬁrm two does not invest, ﬁrm one

becomes a monopolist. Hence, its value (dashed line) will be the same as that of the pure monopolist (dotted
line) for γ2 = 0.2. In summary, as the uncertainty of ﬁrm two’s project increases, the value of ﬁrm two’s
project increases, the value of ﬁrm one’s project decreases, but the aggregate value of both ﬁrms’ projects
still increases (dashed-dotted line) except for γ2 = 0.1, where ﬁrm two does not initiate investment. This
example illustrates the importance of taking into account competitive interactions in real option valuation.
Even without any changes in the parameters of a particular ﬁrm, its value can vary because of changes in
the competitive environment such as changes of a parameter in a competing ﬁrm.

5. Conclusion
In this article we have developed a model to analyze patent-protected R&D investment projects when
there is competition in the development and marketing of the resulting product (in our case a medical
drug). The competitive interactions that occur substantially complicate the solution of the problem since
each of the duopolists has to take into account not only the factors that aﬀect its own decisions, but also

R&D INVESTMENTS WITH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS

42

the factors that aﬀect the decisions of the other duopolist. The real options framework utilized to deal with
investments under uncertainty is extended to incorporate the game theoretic concepts required to deal with
these interactions.
Implementation of the model shows that competition in R&D in most cases not only increases production
and reduces prices, but also shortens the time of developing the product and increases the probability of a
successful development. These beneﬁts to society are countered by increased total investment costs in R&D
and lower aggregate value of the R&D investment projects. We have also seen that if the R&D investment
projects are very marginal, competition in R&D may actually harm the development if there is no mechanism
to select which of the two duopolists who should invest and who should abandon. Only in the these cases
would it be beneﬁcial to protect one single developer from competition.
Some extensions of the model would be easy to implement. For example, the current implementation of
the model assumes that both patents expire at the same date and that net cash ﬂows revert to zero. It would
be trivial to add a terminal value for the R&D investment projects. It would be somewhat more diﬃcult
to implement diﬀerent expiration dates for the patents in our numerical procedure, though strictly in our
formulation of the model this would be of no beneﬁt since generic drugs would be introduced as soon as the
ﬁrst patent expires. A more challenging task would be to increase the number of competitors, but we believe
that the qualitative nature of the results would not change.
In some sense our war of attrition reﬁnement criterion in the case of multiple Nash equilibria in the
game played by the duopolists favors the duopoly situation. This criterion says that when it is not optimal
for both duopolists to continue investing, but it would be optimal for a monopolist to continue investing,
then the duopolist with the highest value of continuing to invest will proceed investing while the other
will abandon. This reasonable rule is not just any Nash equilibrium, it is the Nash equilibrium that gives
the highest ex-ante value for the duopolist’s R&D investment projects and we motivated this choice of
reﬁnement criterion by an economic argument of mutual threats of war of attrition. It is, however, not the
only possible Nash equilibrium; mixed strategies among other equilibria would also be possible, (cf. Huisman
and Kort 1999, Huisman, Thijssen, and Kort 2001), we have also implemented this alternative and found
that unless the R&D investment project is fairly marginal, the results of the two diﬀerent implementations
are basically identical. It is also possible to think in terms of mergers and acquisitions but we have not
pursued any of these two last reﬁnements further in this article.
A more interesting and complex extension would be to add asymmetric information to the model. In the
development of the model we assumed that all participants know the value of the state variables at each

date and that they use these values to make their decisions. It is somewhat unrealistic to suppose that a
duopolist has as good an estimate of the remaining R&D investment costs to complete the other duopolist’s
project as it has of its own project. More realistically, it estimates the competitor’s cost with some error.
The model developed here could potentially help in the formulation of a public policy with respect to
the encouragement of investments in R&D. At the very least it contributes to our understanding of these
important issues in economic development.

Appendix A. The Partial Differential Equation for the Value of the Losing Firm’s
Project
The partial diﬀerential equation (PDE) corresponding to the intuitive derivation in equation (7) can be
derived by Itô’s lemma and (other) standard arguments from stochastic control theory. Basically, the PDE
is derived by applying Itô’s lemma to VlM 2l (Yt + dYt , Klt + dKlt , t + dt), eliminating the martingale terms
by taking the expectation under Q, and diﬀerentiating on both sides of equation (7) with respect to time,
i.e. ‘dividing’ by dt. Starting with the boundary condition from equation (6)
VlM 2l (y, 0, t) = VlD2 (y, t),
for y ≥ 0 and t ∈ [0, T ], the function VlM 2l must fulﬁll the PDE,

VlM 2l (y, k, t) ≥ 0.
That is, the R&D investment continuation region is {(y, k, t) ∈ R2 ×[0, T ] : VlM 2l (y, k, t) ≥ 0}. VlM 2l (y, k, t) <
0 is the condition for when the optimal economic abandonment decision should be taken.
