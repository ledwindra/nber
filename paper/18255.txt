Does Seeing the Doctor More Often Keep You Out of the Hospital?

JEL No. I12,I13
ABSTRACT
By exploiting a unique health insurance benefit design, we provide novel evidence on the causal association
between outpatient and inpatient care. Our results indicate that greater outpatient spending was associated
with more hospital admissions: a $100 increase in outpatient spending was associated with a 2.7%
increase in the probability of having an inpatient event and a 4.6% increase in inpatient spending among
enrollees in our sample. Moreover, we present evidence that the increase in hospital admissions associated
with greater outpatient spending was for conditions in which it is plausible to argue that the physician
and patient could exercise discretion.

1. Introduction
There are plausible scenarios in which a trip to the doctor’s office leads to the detection
and successful treatment of a condition that, if left untreated, would result in illness and
hospitalization. For example, hyperlipidemia, if untreated, is significantly associated with
coronary artery disease, but appropriate diagnosis and treatment with statins substantially
reduces future illness and hospitalization. However, there are equally plausible scenarios in
which a visit to the doctor leads to a referral to a specialist for additional evaluation and potential
invasive treatment for a condition that, if left untreated, would resolve itself in time (or is best
left untreated). For example, a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) exam for prostate cancer that is
abnormally high may lead to a referral to a urologist, a biopsy and surgery.
These two tests for common illnesses are illustrative examples of primary care, one
effective and cost reducing and the other ineffective and cost increasing, that are central to the
current health care reform debate. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)
includes several provisions that bolster the supply of primary care physicians and subsidize
receipt of primary care. Underlying this policy is the belief that primary care is preventive and
cost reducing (see, for example, Starfield et al. 2005; Rittenhouse and Shortell 2009). In
addition, the expansion of health insurance coverage, which is also a prominent part of the ACA,
is often justified with references to the cost-effectiveness of primary care, which is known to
increase among newly insured persons. On the other hand, almost everyone agrees that there is
significant waste in the US health care system. Important evidence supporting the waste
argument comes from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care (e.g., Wennberg et al. 2005; Fisher et
al. 2009). The Dartmouth view is that much spending on medical care is due to “supplysensitive” care, which is care that is intensive (e.g., many visits to specialist), expensive (e.g.,

2

invasive procedures), and driven by provider preferences (e.g., no clearly defined evidence-based
guidelines). Much of this “supply sensitive” care has little proven health benefits. If the
Dartmouth view is correct, then greater insurance coverage and greater use of primary care will
result in more hospitalizations because visits to the doctor often result in aggressive treatment
that involves hospitalization and arguably little health benefit (Fisher et al. 2009).
Empirical evidence on the association between primary (outpatient) care and inpatient
care is sparse, particularly evidence that may be interpreted as causal, despite the importance of
this relationship to health economics and health policy. Research that comes closest to providing
such evidence are studies that examine the association between health insurance status and
hospitalizations because of the known increase in primary care that comes with insurance
coverage.1 Three recent studies provide mixed evidence as to the association between health
insurance coverage and hospitalization using quasi-experimental methods. Using a regression
discontinuity design, Anderson et al. (2012) found that young adults who lost family health
insurance coverage had significantly lower rates of emergency department use and hospital
admissions than those who did not lose family health insurance coverage. Kolstad and Kowalski
(2010) examined the Massachusetts health care reform and found that gaining insurance was
associated with a decrease in hospital admissions through emergency department, an increase in
hospital admissions through other channels, and no change in total hospitalizations. Miller
(2011), who also studied the Massachusetts reform, found that reform was associated with a
decrease in outpatient emergency room visits, particularly those that are preventable with
primary care.

1

However, health insurance changes the price of both inpatient and outpatient care and studies of the association
between health insurance and hospitalization do not necessarily provide information on the association between
primary care and hospitalization.

3

Experimental findings from the Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) showed that
health insurance coverage (i.e., more generous coverage) was associated with an increase in use
of emergency room services and hospitalization (Newhouse 1993). Specifically, emergency
department use was 30% to 35% lower for those with the least generous insurance (95%
coinsurance) than for those with the insurance plan that paid all costs (i.e., free plan), and any
use of inpatient services was 25% lower for those with the least generous insurance (95%
coinsurance) than for those with the insurance plan that paid all costs. Similarly, evidence from
the Oregon Medicaid experiment also shows that obtaining health insurance, in this case,
Medicaid, is positively associated with hospitalization (Finkelstein et al. 2011).
Another line of research related to the question of whether outpatient and inpatient care
are substitutes or complements are studies examining the association between changes in
prescription drug use (or prices), which is a distinct type of outpatient care, and use of inpatient
services. There have been several studies and the evidence from these studies is mixed.2 For
example, Chandra et al. (2010) reported that increases in co-payments for prescription drugs
among employees in the California Public Employees Retirement System were associated with a
decrease in the use of prescription drugs and an increase in the probability of hospitalization.
However, Kaestner and Khan (2012) found that gaining prescription drug insurance through
Medicare Part D was associated with a 28% increase in prescription drug use, a 45% increase in
spending on prescription drugs, and no change in inpatient spending among a sample of
Medicare recipients drawn from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Results from other
studies offer similarly mixed evidence. More importantly, the evidence from these studies is

2

Studies in this area include: Soumerai et al. (1991); Johnson et al. (1997); Briesacher et al. (2005); Hsu et al.
(2006); Chandra et al. (2010); Afendulis et al. (2011); McWilliams et al. (2011); and Kaestner and Khan (2012).

limited by the focus on prescription drugs, which is an important, but small part of outpatient
care.
In sum, there is virtually no evidence, particularly evidence that can be interpreted as
causal, as to whether outpatient and inpatient care are substitutes or complements. This is an
important gap in knowledge because of the importance of this question to understanding how the
health care market operates. Evidence as to whether outpatient and inpatient care are substitutes
or complements is central to both health economics and health policy.
In this paper, we obtain estimates of the association between outpatient and inpatient
care. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to directly assess whether outpatient and inpatient
care are substitutes or complements. Importantly, the research design underlying our empirical
analysis supports the case for interpreting our estimates as causal. Our research takes advantage
of a unique health insurance benefit design in which funds contained in a savings account
(technically a health reimbursement arrangement or HRA) can by design only be used to pay for
outpatient and pharmacy services, not inpatient care and outpatient surgery services. The
inability to use HRA dollars for inpatient care, in contrast to the better known Health Savings
Account (HSA) products, is the key to our research design because it provides an exogenous
change in the price of outpatient care without affecting the price of inpatient care. Capitalizing
on the exogenous change in outpatient plan features contrasts to other studies that, for example,
focus on the association between health insurance or changes in health insurance benefits and
inpatient care, because the changes typically alter the price of both outpatient and inpatient care.
The design was a feature marketed by the insurer intended to prevent a costly hospitalization
from depleting the account balance. The insurance product was designed and sold by a health

5

insurer offering exclusively high-deductible health plans on a full replacement basis in the small
group market.
Results of our analysis indicate that a $100 (4%) increase in outpatient spending was
associated with a 4.6% increase in inpatient spending among employees in the employersponsored insurance plans in our sample. Moreover, the increase in hospital admissions
associated with greater outpatient spending was concentrated among conditions in which there is
significant geographical variation in admission rates and for which physicians exercise
considerable discretion—care consistent with “supply sensitive” treatment that has been shown
to be without clinical evidence of its effectiveness. In contrast, there was no association between
outpatient spending and admissions for low-discretion (variation) procedures such as major
cardiovascular care or for births.
2. Setting and Data
Data for the empirical analysis are drawn from the universe of claims for a small
Midwestern health insurance company that was an early leader in the “consumer-driven” health
plan market. The data include claims and enrollment information for employees and their
dependents within firms offering a high-deductible health plan sponsored by the health insurance
company from 2000 through mid-2006. We have information on all paid claims for inpatient,
outpatient, and pharmaceutical services throughout the policy year. We use only observations
that included full policy years. In addition, we have information on health plan characteristics
including HRA “deposits” at the beginning of each policy year, roll-over account balances from
the prior year, deductible amount, coinsurance rates for both in- and out-of-network care (the
claims data contain an indicator for network status of the provider), out-of-pocket maximum

6

levels, and copayments for pharmaceuticals. Employers are able to change plan characteristics
annually.
The HRA plan design used notional (non-transferable) accounts for first-dollar coverage
of pre-specified health care purchases. Employers and employees could fund their accounts on a
tax-free basis and unspent dollars roll over into subsequent years. As noted earlier, a key feature
of the insurance plan design was that HRA dollars could not be used to pay for expenditures
associated with inpatient care or outpatient surgery; a separate hospital and surgery deductible is
specified in the benefit design to impose cost-sharing on that type of utilization. Note that this
plan feature is distinct from HSA designs, which allow account dollars to be used for inpatient
and outpatient health care expenditures.3 Another advantageous feature of the HRA plans in our
study is that the insurer sold the insurance policies exclusively on a total replacement basis;
employers do not offer competing plans from this or other insurers and almost all firms offer just
one insurance plan to employees.4 Therefore, employees do not choose among insurance plans
and we do not have to address the selection issue that comes from employee plan choice. We
limit our sample to firms that had five or more enrollees because of the possibility that changes
in health and use of services for specific enrollees will determine insurance plan features. In
larger firms, insurance plan features are plausibly exogenous with respect to individual enrollee
behavior.5

3

The insurer began offering HSAs after they were created in the 2004 Medicare Modernization Act, but given the
timing of our data very few firms offered them to employees. A small number of enrollees (<1%) were dropped
because they were enrolled in HSAs.
4
A small number, 3%, of employers offered more than one plan design to employees in the study period. Most
commonly, employees could select a higher or lower deductible option. However, results reported below did not
change appreciably when these few employers were excluded from the sample.
5
Results are virtually unchanged if we limit the sample to firms with 10 employees, suggesting that results are not
being driven by employer-responses to employee health care spending, which are more likely to occur in very small
firms.

7

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for individual enrollees by policy year. Our data
include 2,380 company-years representing 959 unique firms. Note that the period represents the
start-up period for the insurer’s operation, which began operation in 2000, thus there are very
few employers in the early years. We limit the analysis to firms with information for full policy
years. Therefore, because our data only include completed policy years ending by 7/31/06 the
number of firms (observations) in the sample is reduced substantially in 2005. The average firm
size is approximately 25 employees. The average age of the employee is about 40 years.6 In just
over half of cases the employee is a single enrollee. Not surprisingly, and consistent with
national trends, spending in all categories increased over time. Outpatient spending increased
from $2350 in 2001 to $2872 in 2005 and average pharmaceutical spending more than doubled
over the period. The fraction of enrollees using inpatient services stayed relatively constant at
15% over the period, though average spending on inpatient care increased.
3. Research Design and Econometric Methods
Our objective is to obtain estimates of the association between outpatient care (spending)
and inpatient care (spending). This empirical objective is motivated by two hypotheses grounded
in theory as to the causes of an association between outpatient care (spending) and inpatient care
(spending). The first hypothesis is that outpatient care consists of treatments that repair health
subsequent to illness and/or prevent illness. This hypothesis is consistent with the human capital
model of the demand for health and health care (Grossman 1972). In this case, outpatient care is
health improving and, all else equal, will decrease inpatient care, which is an indicator of serious
illness. The all else equal assumption is particularly important because the association between
the quantity of outpatient and inpatient care is almost surely positive if health (shocks) are not
well measured. The second hypothesis is that outpatient care consists of treatments that have

8

little value in terms of repairing health or preventing illness. This hypothesis is consistent with
theories of physician agency and supplier induced demand (e.g., McGuire 2000), and the
geographical variation in treatments documented by the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. In this
case, more outpatient care results in greater inpatient care, as physicians exercise discretion and
treat marginal illnesses “aggressively” using intensive, inpatient care. The two hypotheses are
not mutually exclusive and it is highly likely that outpatient care has characteristics consistent
with both hypotheses. Here, we estimate the average association between outpatient and inpatient
care.
Ideally, our estimates are interpretable as causal estimates. To obtain such estimates, we
estimate the following regression model:

(1)

.

In equation (1), inpatient utilization (i.e., any use) of employee/family i in firm j in year t
depends on a firm-specific fixed effect,

, year fixed effects,

, coinsurance for in-network care

(COIN), coinsurance for out-of-network care (COOUT), the hospital-specific deductible
(HOSPDEDUCT), the out-of-pocket maximum (OOPMAX), and personal characteristics (X) of
the employee/family (e.g., age, gender, number of dependents, year of tenure in the plan). Our
interest is in the effect of outpatient spending (OUTSPEND) on inpatient use. Note that only
those plan features that will affect inpatient spending directly are included because we include

9

outpatient spending in equation (1), and plan characteristics that affect outpatient spending such
as the outpatient deductible and the employee HRA are omitted.
The main challenge in estimating equation (1) is that outpatient spending may be
influenced by unmeasured characteristics that also affect inpatient spending, most notably health
status. Additionally, there is a mechanical, reverse causal relationship in which inpatient care
necessitates follow-up outpatient treatment. To address the potential endogeneity concern we use
an instrumental variables approach. The instruments for outpatient spending are the employer’s
contribution to the spending account (HRA) and other benefit design features that are determined
prior to the start of the year and affect only the cost of outpatient use. For example, a change in
the amount of employer’s contribution to the HRA, which by design is only relevant to
outpatient spending, will affect outpatient use, but not inpatient use beyond how outpatient use
affects inpatient use.7
The identifying assumption of the instrumental variables approach is that employers
make decisions regarding HRA contributions and other benefit design features independently of
employee health and preferences for health care. Plausible explanations for employer changes in
benefit design include the rising costs of health care, changes in firm profitability or the firm’s
competitive position that affect decisions about compensation (including health care benefits),
and potential adjustments to a new benefit plan for which the firm had no prior experience. It is
important to note that equation (1) includes firm-specific fixed effects that control for time
invariant employer-specific factors that might be associated with both health care spending and
health plan characteristics. Below, we present evidence that supports the identification
assumption underlying the instrumental variables approach.
7

It is possible that an employer’s contribution to the account could have an income effect on the household and thus
indirectly change inpatient spending, but given the relatively small magnitudes involved the size of such an effect
would be exceedingly small.

10

In Table 2, we present data on benefit plan characteristics that are the source of variation
used to instrument for outpatient spending. The figures in Table 2 have been adjusted for the
changing composition of firms in order to provide a description of how plan features have
changed over time within firm, which is the key source of variation that we use to obtain
estimates of the association between inpatient and outpatient spending. The values in Table 2
indicate that employers tend to decrease plan generosity systematically over time: employer
account contributions fall over time within firm by approximately $100 per year and the
outpatient deductible increases by approximately $50 per year. 8 The observed changes represent
compelling and substantial sources of within-firm variation in outpatient benefit generosity that
are expected to affect outpatient spending decisions by enrollees. Importantly, the changes
pertain only to outpatient spending and therefore provide a source of plausibly exogenous
variation to identify the association between inpatient and outpatient spending.
The specification of the first stage model used to predict outpatient spending is:

(2)
.

In equation (2), outpatient spending depends on the following excluded instruments that by
design can only affect outpatient spending: employer contribution to the account
We do not directly observe the employer contributions to the HRA in our data because the insurer only recorded
the total contribution to the account balance at the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, we are able to proxy for the
employer’s contribution by determining the minimum observed account balance measured at the beginning of the
policy year among employees in firm j and year t. The minimum account balance is specific to employees in each
coverage option: single, employee plus one dependent, employee plus two or more dependents. Hence to the extent
that at least one employee in each coverage option-firm-year cell chooses not to contribute to their account (the
calculation excludes rollover dollars), our approach will identify the true contribution of the firm to the account. If
all employees contribute some amount to the HRA, the minimum observed amount is a reasonable proxy to the
generosity of the employer contribution. See Lo Sasso et al. (2010) for additional details.

11

(EMPCONTRIB), the outpatient deductible (OUTDEDUCT), and the pharmacy copayment level
(COPAY). In addition, the other plan features that may affect inpatient care and personal
characteristics described in equation (1) are included in the model.
Instrumental variables estimates obtained from equations (1) and (2) represent local
average treatment effects (LATE). As illustrated in Table 2 the primary sources of variation
driving changes in outpatient care are changes in employer contributions to the HRA and
changes in the outpatient deductible. Thus the employees who are induced to alter their
consumption of outpatient care are a relatively healthy group of employees and unlikely to be
chronically ill.
To this point we have ignored dynamic aspects of the problem. However, outpatient care
this year may affect inpatient care in the subsequent year. That is, outpatient spending in period t
may result in treatment that improves health in period t+1 and reduces inpatient care in period
t+1. Such a direct relationship between lagged outpatient spending and future inpatient care is
consistent with the human capital model of the demand for health and the hypothesis that
primary care is preventive and cost reducing. Alternatively, if outpatient spending involves
largely “supply sensitive” care then previous outpatient spending has little effect on current
health (perhaps even a negative effect) and will have little influence on current inpatient care. In
fact, outpatient spending in period t that is largely “supply sensitive” may increase inpatient care
in period t+1 because of the persistence of such physician-induced care.
To summarize, if outpatient care is largely preventive in nature and health improving,
then it may have dynamic effects that reduce future inpatient care (and outpatient care).
Alternatively, if outpatient care is “supply sensitive” in nature with little health benefit, then
lagged outpatient care may have dynamic effects that either have no association or a positive

12

association with current inpatient care. In order to assess the influence of lagged outpatient
spending on current inpatient care, we reformulate our model as:

(3)

,

where inpatient use in time t is function of lagged outpatient use. We are able to instrument for
lagged outpatient spending with same (lagged) instrument set described earlier. The specification
of equation (3) yields estimates of the total effect of lagged outpatient spending on inpatient care
that includes the direct association and the indirect associations that operate through current
outpatient spending and lagged inpatient spending. If outpatient spending is truly preventive, and
the relationship is dynamic, we expect the estimate of the association between lagged outpatient
spending and inpatient care to be negative. One necessary compromise in the lagged
specification is that it requires three, not two, years of consecutive enrollment by firms, thus
reducing our sample size considerably.
We also estimate an alternative specification in which we include current outpatient
spending in the model:

(4)
.

13

The only difference between equations (3) and (4) is the inclusion of contemporaneous
outpatient spending. Including current outpatient spending eliminates the indirect association
between lagged outpatient spending and inpatient care that operates through current outpatient
spending.
4. Results
4.a. First Stage—Associations between Plan Characteristics and Outpatient Spending
Table 3 displays estimates of the effect of a hypothetical $100 increase in the employer
contribution to the HRA on outpatient spending.9 The employer contribution is only one of three
excluded instruments in our model, but it provides a representative breakdown of how the
change in outpatient care is manifested. The estimate indicates that an additional $100
contribution to the HRA account yields a $32 increase in outpatient spending. The estimate is
statistically significant suggesting a strong first stage relationship between the employer’s
contribution to the HRA and outpatient spending.10
In order to understand what components of outpatient care change when the employer
contribution changes, we estimated similar first-stage regression models for three major
components of outpatient spending plus a residual category, which we refer to as “other”. The
three non-residual components of outpatient spending are outpatient specialty services that
includes services provided by otorhinolaryngology, pulmonologist, allergist, neurologist,
dermatology, and rehabilitation, among others; spending on office visits defined as office-based
evaluation and management for new or established patients ranging from 10 minutes to 1 hour;
and spending on prescription drugs. Estimates indicate that a $100 increase in employer
contribution to the HRA is associated with a $11 increase in spending on outpatient specialty
9

A full set of estimates is presented in Appendix Table 1.
The F-statistic associated with the excluded instruments is 23.

10

14

services; an $8 increase in spending associated with office visits; a $6 increase in spending on
prescription drugs; and a $7 increase in “other” outpatient spending. The results in Table 3
suggest that a more generous employer contribution to the account leads patients to visit the
doctor’s office more frequently (25% of the total effect), which in turn leads to referrals to
outpatient specialty care (one-third of the total effect) and some change in pharmaceutical use
(20% of the total effect). In the next section we consider whether the observed increases in
outpatient care are associated with changes in inpatient utilization.
4.b. Associations between Inpatient and Outpatient Spending
Table 4 reports OLS and instrumental variables (2SLS) estimates of the association
between inpatient spending and outpatient spending. Two dependent variables are used: a binary
variable representing the presence of any inpatient spending and the amount of inpatient
spending. For each dependent-independent variable combination, we estimate two model
specifications that differ according to whether we include age by gender interaction terms. We
provide the alternative specifications to assess whether changes in employee characteristics over
time that are known to affect health and spending on medical care affect estimates. If the agegender interaction terms have little effect on our main coefficient of interest, it is evidence in
support of the research design. We present estimates of equation (1) for both dependent variables
obtained using linear regression methods.11
OLS estimates in the left hand side of Table 4 indicate that a $100 increase in outpatient
spending is associated with a 0.2 percentage point increase in the probability of having any
inpatient spending. IV estimates indicate that a $100 increase in outpatient spending is associated
with a 0.4 percentage point (2.7% of mean) increase in the probability of having any inpatient
11

We have also estimated binary models and, for analyses of inpatient spending, generalized linear models using a
gamma distribution with log link. Estimates from the alternative models were very similar to the linear models and
are available upon request of the authors.

15

spending. To put this estimate in context, consider that the employer contribution to the HRA
account declined by approximately $500 on average between 2000 and 2005. Using the estimate
from Table 3, this decline in the employer contribution is associated with a $160 decrease in
annual outpatient spending. Based on the estimate of the association between outpatient spending
and the probability of any inpatient care, this $160 decrease in outpatient spending decreased the
probability of having any inpatient care by 4.4%. This is a clinically and economically
significant effect of the observed change in the employer contribution to the HRA account. Also
note that the addition of age-by-gender interaction terms to the model has virtually no effect,
which suggest that changes in employee composition are not affecting estimates. Not
surprisingly, given the results in Table 3, the F-statistics for the joint significance of the excluded
instruments are between 23 and 25 depending on the model. Also, we fail to reject the null
hypothesis in the over-identification test, which is important evidence supporting the validity of
the research design.
The right hand panel of Table 4 presents estimates of associations between outpatient
spending and inpatient spending. The OLS estimate of the association between outpatient
spending and inpatient spending indicates that a $100 increase in outpatient spending is
associated with a $77 (4 percent) increase in inpatient spending. The 2SLS estimate of same
relationship indicates a slightly larger effect size of $89 (4.6%). Consider the effect of the $160
decrease in outpatient spending as a result of the change in average employer contributions
between 2000 and 2005 on inpatient spending. Such a decrease in outpatient spending decreased
inpatient spending by $144.
Table 5 presents estimates from the simple, dynamic model described earlier. Here, we
allow for a lagged effect of outpatient spending. We focus our discussion on the instrumental

16

variables estimates. The estimate of the association between lagged outpatient spending and any
inpatient care is 0.0025 and statistically significant. The IV estimate of the association between
lagged outpatient spending and inpatient spending is positive, small and not statistically
significant. Notably, both estimates are positive, which is inconsistent with the argument that
outpatient care is largely preventive and more consistent with the argument that outpatient care is
largely of the “supply sensitive” type.
Estimates presented in the third and fourth columns of Table 5 are obtained from a model
that includes both lagged and current outpatient spending. IV estimates of associations between
lagged outpatient spending and inpatient spending are small and not statistically significant.
Overall, estimates in Table 5 suggest that lagged outpatient spending has little effect on current
inpatient care, which is evidence inconsistent with the argument that the association between
outpatient spending and inpatient care is dynamic and that outpatient spending is largely
preventive.
In contrast, IV estimates of associations between current outpatient spending and
inpatient care in Table 5 remain positive, statistically significant and more or less the same
magnitude as estimates obtained from models that omit lagged outpatient spending. So again, we
find evidence consistent with the argument that, on average, outpatient care increases the
quantity and spending on downstream care (i.e., inpatient care).
In order to assess what types of inpatient conditions are affected by changes in outpatient
care, we examined the association between outpatient spending and inpatient admissions grouped
by the amount of geographical variation in admission rates. Geographical variation in inpatient
admissions is often used as a marker for physician discretion—decisions for which there is
uncertainty over whether an admission is necessary and/or clinically beneficial (Sirovich et al.

17

2008). Changes in outpatient care should plausibly have larger effects on high-variation hospital
admissions for which there is a great deal of physician discretion than for low-variation hospital
admissions for which there is little physician discretion. For example, we might expect to
observe some enrollees induced into back and neck surgical procedures and other care that is
subject to greater physician discretion when people are exogenously exposed to greater amounts
of outpatient care.
We grouped hospital admissions into categories using diagnosis related group (DRG)
codes and the classification system employed by Silber et al. (2010) that was developed to
distinguish between inpatient events with low variation across providers (example: major
cardiovascular procedures), middle variation across providers (example: laparoscopic
cholecystectomy), and high variation across providers (example: spinal fusion surgery). The full
list of procedures and DRG codes is available in Appendix Table 2.
Table 6 presents estimates of associations between outpatient spending and hospital
admission rates classified by the extent of potential provider discretion. Estimates are generally
consistent with expectations. Changes in outpatient spending have minimal effect for low
variation procedures, and the effect size increases in absolute value with the degree of variation
in care. High variation inpatient care, including back and shoulder procedures increase
significantly when individuals use more outpatient health care services. A $100 (4%) increase in
outpatient spending is associated with a 0.1 percentage point (5% of mean) increase in the
probability of admission for a high-variation condition.
We also assessed whether outpatient spending had an association with hospital
admissions for ambulatory-care sensitive (ACS) conditions. ACS conditions are widely thought
to be preventable when access to primary care is unimpeded and have been defined by the

18

Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs)
and include admissions for diabetes complications, hypertension, asthma, and bacterial
pneumonia (AHRQ 2012). Previous work has examined ambulatory care sensitive conditions as
an outcome in different populations that could be affected by insurance coverage (e.g., Bindman
et al. 1995; Pappas et al. 1997; Shi et al. 1999; Kaestner et al. 2001; Dafny and Gruber 2005). If
outpatient spending is largely prevention, then the association between outpatient spending and
ACS admissions is expected to be negative. However, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care has
examined ambulatory care sensitive conditions and documented that admission rates for these
conditions are highly variable across geography, at least in the Medicare population. The high
degree of geographic variation implies that the ambulatory care sensitive conditions identified by
AHRQ and others may be more discretionary than the developers of these measures believe.
Specifically, the Dartmouth authors write: “When science-based guidelines are weak, physicians
must be guided by their subjective opinions about the effectiveness of admitting such patients to
hospitals, rather than providing treatment in another setting. Hospitalization rates for these – and
for most medical conditions – are also highly correlated with the local supply of hospital beds”
(Dartmouth Atlas 2012).
The fourth column of Table 6 presents the instrumental variables estimate of the
association between outpatient spending and admission for an ambulatory-care sensitive
condition. Consistent with Dartmouth Atlas view, we find that increases in outpatient spending
results in a statistically significant increase in hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive
conditions. The effect size, 0.07 percentage points, is close to the estimate associated with highvariation admissions.

19

Finally, we examined whether outpatient spending was associated with births. Births
represent largely a falsification test related to the measurement of key variables in our
specification. While there is little reason to expect increases in the employer contribution to the
HRA to have a causal effect on births, if savings account contributions were improperly
measured or if employer contributions were altered based on potential health care need an effect
might manifest when examining births. Thus it is reassuring that the effect of outpatient spending
on births is very close to zero and statistically insignificant.
5. Conclusion
An important issue in assessing recent health care reform is the likely costs and benefits
of expanded access to primary care. Proponents of expanded use of primary care often argue that
in addition to improving health, expanded primary care use may reduce the costs of health care
because increased contact with primary care providers will allow for greater detection of
previously unknown and untreated conditions, hence leading to reduced hospitalizations. In this
article, we take advantage of a unique health insurance benefit design to assess the causal
relationship between outpatient services and hospitalization.
Using proprietary data from an insurer, we employ an instrumental variables strategy to
investigate whether variation in the use of outpatient services were associated with changes in
hospitalizations. To our knowledge, ours if the first paper to provide such estimates, at least
estimates that are plausibly interpretable as causal. Estimates indicated that greater outpatient
spending was associated with more hospital admissions and greater inpatient spending. For
example, a $100 increase in outpatient spending was associated with a 2.7% increase in the
probability of having an inpatient event and a 4.6% increase in inpatient spending among
employees in the employer-sponsored insurance plans in our sample. Moreover, we presented

20

evidence that the increase in hospital admissions associated with greater outpatient spending was
for conditions in which it is plausible to argue that the physician could exercise more
discretion—treat “aggressively”. In contrast, there was no association between outpatient
spending and admissions for births or low-variation procedures such as major cardiovascular
care.
The nearly dollar for dollar positive association between changes in outpatient spending
and changes in inpatient spending has significant implications for both theory and policy. In
terms of theory, our results suggest that outpatient spending and inpatient spending are
complements, at least at the margin for which our LATE estimates apply. More importantly, the
positive association between outpatient and inpatient spending that we find is not, as is often the
case, because unmeasured health confounds the association. Tests of the validity of the
instrumental variables research design we employed support its validity, which implies that
changes in outpatient spending that result from changes in insurance plan benefit designs are
plausibly exogenous. Thus, the positive association between outpatient spending and inpatient
spending we find is consistent with the Dartmouth view that much health care spending, in this
case outpatient spending, is “supply sensitive” and largely without substantial health benefit.
This result persisted even when we estimated a dynamic model that allowed lagged outpatient
spending to influence current inpatient care.
It is interesting to note that the context of our results was a high-deductible, “consumer
driven” insurance plan with a focus on demand side cost sharing. Our results suggest that
consumers appear to respond significantly to changes in cost sharing, and that even though the
initial change in consumer health care use in response to changes in cost sharing is for relatively
low cost, outpatient care, there is also a decrease in subsequent use of more expensive inpatient

21

care. For example, the $500 average decrease in the employer contribution to the HRA that
occurred between 2000 and 2005 was associated with a $160 decrease in outpatient spending and
a $144 decrease in inpatient spending. Thus, total spending decreased by $304, or approximately
5%. Our results suggest that high deductible insurance plans targeted at reducing outpatient use
of services may be effective at reducing the discretionary use of inpatient services that other
researchers have suggested have marginal health benefit. The consumer-directed approach is a
contrast to administrative and supply-side approaches to reduce the same supposed unnecessary
use of services such as the establishment of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that
identifies cost-effective prevention services that merit no cost sharing; the establishment of the
Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute; and payment reforms linking payments to clinical
outcomes and how the delivery of care is organized (e.g., accountable care organizations).
Overall, the findings from our study are consistent with the argument made in Sirovich et
al. (2008) and others associated with the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. In this view, using
more primary care services leads to more hospitalizations as a result of physicians’ discretionary
decisions regarding aggressive and intensive treatment. Cleary not all physicians need to practice
medicine in an “aggressive” treatment style for such findings to obtain; when individuals are
exogenously induced to use more outpatient care through a more generous insurance plan design,
enrollees merely need to have a positive probability of seeing a physician with an aggressive
treatment style. In addition, health insurance has a direct effect on hospitalization because it
lowers the price of inpatient care. The implication of these findings is that expanding health
insurance, as recent federal reform (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) proposes, will
be cost increasing. While the greater costs associated with increased use of primary care may

22

come with improvements in health, a hypothesis in need of more credible evidence, costs will
increase nevertheless. Claims that costs will decrease do not appear to be well founded.
