The Nature of Surgeon Human Capital Depreciation
Jason M. Hockenberry and Lorens A. Helmchen
NBER Working Paper No. 20017
March 2014
JEL No. I10,J24
ABSTRACT
To test how practice interruptions affect worker productivity, we estimate how temporal breaks affect
surgeons’ performance of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Using a sample of 188 surgeons
who performed 56,315 CABG procedures in Pennsylvania between 2006 and 2010, we find that a
surgeon’s additional day away from the operating room raised patients’ inpatient mortality risk by
up to 0.067 percentage points (2.4% relative effect) but reduced total hospitalization costs by up to
0.59 percentage points. In analyses of 93 high-volume surgeons treating 9,853 patients admitted via
an emergency department, where temporal distance effects are most plausibly exogenous, an additional
day away raised mortality risk by 0.398 percentage points (11.4% relative effect) but reduced cost
by up to 1.396 percentage points. These estimates imply a cost per life-year saved ranging from $7,871
to $18,500, rendering additional treatment intensity within surgery cost-effective at conventional cutoffs.
Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that after returning from temporal breaks surgeons
may be less likely to recognize and address life-threatening complications, in turn reducing resource
use. This form of human capital loss would explain the decrease in worker productivity and the
simultaneous reduction in input use.

I. Introduction
Fluctuations of human capital and worker productivity have been the subject of a long literature
stretching back to Ben-Porath (1967). This early work on human capital and productivity
spurred multiple lines of inquiry. One of these has focused on organizational forgetting, in that a
firm’s productivity may erode because its workers’ human capital decays or because of turnover
or breaks in production (Argote, 1999, Darr, Argote and Epple, 1995; Benkard 2000; Thompson
2007, David and Brachet, 2009 & 2011).

Previous research has measured the reduction in individual worker productivity when the
temporal distance between tasks increases. These reductions have been documented for jobs with
routine tasks ranging from data entry (Globerson Levin and Shtub, 1989) to mechanical
assembly (Bailey, 1989) and car radio production (Shafer, Nembhard, and Uzumeri, 2001).
Recent work has focused on more complex tasks arising in the provision of health care. These
studies suggest temporal distance effects may substantially impact patient outcomes in surgery
(Hockenberry, Lien and Chou, 2008) and in the delivery of emergency medical services (David
and Brachet, 2011).

In this paper we make three contributions. First, we develop a framework for distinguishing
between two mechanisms that explain how a decline in surgeon human capital, measured here as
increased temporal distance, might impair surgeon productivity, measured here as patient
outcomes. Previous literature has documented that organizational and individual skill
depreciation between performing temporally distant tasks adversely affects health care

1

outcomes, but the underlying mechanism has not been established (Hockenberry, Lien and Chou,
2008; David and Brachet, 2011).

Increasing temporal distance could lead to either inefficient care or inattentive care. After
temporal breaks, surgeons may fail to identify and treat life-threatening complications
(inattentive care). For instance, surgeons may be less likely to notice small but potentially lifethreatening anomalies during surgery that require additional tests or procedures to ensure the
patient’s survival. This form of human capital depreciation will reduce the patient’s survival
probability and at the same time reduce resource use.

Alternatively, temporal breaks may erode surgeons’ proficiency and thus prompt them to apply
more treatment (inefficient care). For instance, surgeons may take longer to complete a given
procedure or compensate for lower proficiency with additional testing and procedures. This form
of human capital depreciation will raise the surgeon’s resource use without raising the patient’s
survival probability.

We observe the resource use and survival probabilities of patients undergoing coronary artery
bypass grafting (CABG) and thus can distinguish between these two forms of surgeon human
capital depreciation empirically. We find that the time since the surgeon last performed the
procedure raises peri-procedural mortality in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant
way. The temporal distance effects are lasting in that they also predict in-hospital mortality. We
also find that temporal distance is associated with reduced resource use. This pattern is consistent
with the hypothesis that temporal breaks lead to inattentive care in that surgeons tend to miss

altogether and therefore fail to address life-threatening complications, rather than notice but
address them less efficiently. Policies that affect surgeons’ procedure schedules may reduce
operative mortality for patients undergoing coronary revascularization but they may also raise
cost.

Second, we test and compare how two measures of temporal distance affect surgeon
performance. We examine both the impact of the number of days since the surgeon last
performed CABG surgery, which captures the effect of depreciation in procedure-specific human
capital, and the impact of the number of days since the surgeon performed any procedure, which
proxies for depreciation in general surgical human capital.1 Our empirical results suggest that
general surgical human capital affects patient outcomes substantially more than procedurespecific human capital.

Finally, we exploit the variation in resource use induced by variation in temporal distance to
measure the productivity of additional medical spending on the margin. Our back-of-theenvelope calculation suggests that the cost per life-year saved resulting from more attentive, and
thus intensive treatment within a chosen procedure, ranges from $7,400 to $17,500, in line with
other recent estimates (Doyle, 2005 & 2011; Chandra and Staiger 2007; Almond, Doyle,
Kowalski and Williams, 2010) and well below the conventional $100,000 per life-year threshold
(Cutler, 2004).
1 We examined the frequency distributions of the other procedures and found those that are
typically performed by the surgeons who perform CABG include heart valve procedures,
procedures on thoracic vessels (other than bypass), and device implants.

2. Background
2.1 Background on human capital depreciation
There is an extensive literature in industrial engineering that seeks to establish the degree of
human capital depreciation, also referred to as forgetting, in productive tasks. Several studies
have examined the speed of human capital depreciation by randomizing individuals engaged in a
repetitive task, ranging from breaks of one day to a few weeks to even a few months (Globerson,
Levin and Shtub, 1989; Bailey, 1989: Shafer, Nembhard and Uzumeri, 2001). Worker
productivity declined a few percentage points after an interruption lasting a single day
(Globerson, Levin and Shtub, 1989) and increased at an increasing rate with each additional day
of interruption (Jaber, 2011).

While studies of human capital depreciation in manufacturing settings have focused on the
performance of repetitive tasks, they have ignored more complex cognitive tasks like those often
found in health care delivery. For instance, highly variable “inputs” in health care delivery, such
as each patient’s individual anatomy and disease progression profile, differ from the largely
homogeneous inputs found in manufacturing. Thus healthcare delivery, and in our case surgery,
places significant demands on workers’ cognitive skills. Earlier work examined how breaks in
the performance of cardiac surgery affect patient outcomes, arguing that these outcomes reflect
productivity differences (Hockenberry, Lien and Chou, 2008). For CABG surgery in Taiwan,
the authors estimated that relative to a 0-2 day break, a break from performing CABG of 3-14
days raised mortality by 11-14%, and a break of more than 15 days raised mortality by 22%.

That study only measured temporal distance between performing CABG procedures. Yet,
studies on forgetting suggest that other activities in which workers engage during breaks from
the productive task of interest may play an equally important role in human capital depreciation
(Jaber, 2011). In our context, many surgeons will perform other procedures, such as isolated
heart valve procedures and other vascular procedures that require the same cognitive skill set as
CABG and that therefore may slow the rate of skill depreciation between CABG procedures.
Thus, to the extent that Hockenberry et al. did not account for the performance of skillpreserving tasks between the CABG surgeries they observed, their results would underestimate
the true effect of skill depreciation on surgeon productivity. In this paper, we contrast the
performance effects of the number of days since the surgeon last performed CABG with the
performance effects of the number of days since the surgeon performed any procedure to assess
the role of CABG-specific skill components in explaining the productivity loss after temporal
breaks.

2.2 The performance and organization of CABG
Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a major surgical procedure intended to improve the
heart’s supply with oxygen. A surgeon harvests part of a vessel from a different area of the body
(typically the groin or chest wall), opens the chest cavity, and implants the harvested vessel
segment to bypass the diseased section of the artery. CABG surgery takes approximately four
hours and patients generally spend at least one week recovering in the hospital. In some cases
the patient will also need a concomitant valve replacement or repair procedure, which lengthens
surgery time further (Hockenberry et al, 2011).

3. Methods
3.1 Empirical model
We assume that a surgeon’s human capital Q0 decays exponentially over time at rate δ (Rubin
and Wenzel, 1996; Kahana and Adler, 2012):
Q(t) = Q0e-δt.
or
lnQ(t) = lnQ0 - δt (1)
If we further assume that patient outcomes improve with human capital, (1) predicts that a
surgeon’s longer temporal break will reduce patient survival.
Our proxy for the current stock of human capital Q(t) is based on the literature on organizational
learning and forgetting.2 This literature has shown that past production experience impacts
productivity (Argote, Beckman and Epple, 1990; Benkard, 2000), which in our setting would be
reflected in increased survival. These studies also conclude that the stock of past production
experience will depreciate with t, the time since it was accumulated (Argote, Beckman and
Epple, 1990; Benkard, 2000). This form of organizational forgetting is thought to be tied, at
least in part, to individual worker human capital decay (David and Brachet, 2011). Furthermore,
a long literature indicates that provider quality is a function of experience, specifically there is a
relationship between a provider’s volume of procedures and patient outcomes (Luft, Bunker,

2

The lifetime stock of accumulated capital and its depreciation will be captured empirically by

individual fixed effects and surgeons’ years of experience, measured by the time since they
graduated from medical school. In line with the industrial engineering literature on forgetting,
we focus here on the short-term fluctuations of this stock.

Enthoven, 1979; Luft, Hunt and Maerki, 1987; Halm, Lee and Chassin, 2003; Gaynor, Seider
and Vogt, 2005: Hockenberry, Lien and Chou, 2010). 3

Thus we estimate the following equation:
mi,j,k,y = β0 + β1 ln(hospital volume) i,j + β2 ln(surgeon volume) i,k + β3 days since last
procedurei,j + β4 Xi + ρj + φk + ψy + εi,j,k,y (2)
3

There is disagreement on whether this is due to patients sorting to better providers (selective

referral) or whether experience itself in the form of volume actually improves outcomes (practice
makes perfect). Our identification strategy is based on the inclusion of hospital and surgeon
fixed effects, ρj and φk respectively. All the hospitals and nearly all the surgeons in our data were
performing CABG on patients prior to the start of our study period. Thus we argue that hospital
and surgeon fixed effects control for provider quality that has been revealed to the market at the
start of the study period. Furthermore, in the case of the depreciation effect, any positive
selection effect where an increased demand for a surgeon’s service is attributable to unobserved
surgeon characteristics is likely to bias the estimate of the temporal distance effect, represented
by β3 in equation (2), toward zero. Pennsylvania has a public report card system for both
hospitals and surgeons performing CABG, which appears to steer patients away from poorly
performing and low-volume surgeons (those performing fewer than 30 procedures annually)
whereas distance from home is the main driver of hospital choice (Wang, Hockenberry, Chou
and Yang, 2011; Epstein, 2010). There is little variation in these report cards over time.
Nevertheless we conducted robustness checks by including recent report card information in our
specifications. The effects of report cards on mortality were not precisely estimated, and did not
change the coefficients or statistical significance of our temporal distance measures.

where mi,j,k,y is a mortality indicator for patient i at hospital j whose procedure was performed by
surgeon k in calendar year y. Hospital and surgeon volume are measured as the volume in the
year leading up to and including the procedure on the patient surgeon k operated on just before
operating on patient i.4 X are the observable characteristics of patient i including gender, race,
age, source of insurance coverage and comorbidities. Each of our models also includes hospital
and surgeon fixed effects, ρj and φk, as well as year fixed effects, ψy.

The coefficient β3 for “days since last procedure” is the empirical estimate of δ; it captures the
depreciation of human capital, measured by its effect on the patient’s mortality risk, due to
increased temporal distance since CABG or any surgical procedure was last performed by the
patient’s surgeon. Since we measure time as the number of days since last performing CABG or
any procedure, β3 is the effect of an additional elapsed day on the patient’s probability of death,
and is expected to be positive. To distinguish between depreciation in procedure-specific and
general surgical human capital, we estimate separate models in which we define temporal
distance as the number of days since last performing CABG or last performing any inpatient
procedure. We estimate linear probability models and cluster the standard errors at the surgeon
level to account for within-surgeon correlation of the disturbances across procedures.

4

By construction, temporal distance and surgeon volume will be correlated. The correlation

between surgeon volume and time since the surgeon last performed CABG was -.21. The
correlation between surgeon volume and time since the surgeon last performed any inpatient
procedure was -.12. We estimated specifications of our models excluding surgeon volume with
nearly identical results.

To distinguish between the two competing forms of surgeon human capital depreciation
(inattentive care versus inefficient care), we model the total cost C of treating a patient whose
health and socio-demographic characteristics at the time of admission are represented by x and
whose surgeon last performed a procedure t days ago:
C(t, x) = a(x) + p(x)r(t)c(t)
where a is the fixed cost of performing the procedure, p is the probability that the patient will
suffer a life-threatening complication during the procedure, r is ratio of the potential
complications the physician observes and treats successfully, and c is the effort and time cost to
the surgeon of addressing the complication. In line with our model of inattentive care we assume
that r decreases with t: r’ < 0. Thus, the patient’s mortality risk is p(1-r) and an increase in the
surgeon’s time away will increase the patient’s mortality risk by –pr’ > 0. In line with our model
of inefficient care, we assume that the cost of addressing a complication c increases with the time
since the last procedure t: c’ > 0.

A priori the effect of time away from the operating room on total cost is ambiguous:
Ct =p[ r’c + rc’]. (6)
The first term in brackets, r’c < 0, represents “inattentive care” resulting from increased temporal
distance: the surgeon will be less likely to spot, and consequently address successfully, a lifethreatening complication, thus raising mortality but reducing cost. The second term in brackets,
rc’ > 0, represents “inefficient care” resulting from increased temporal distance: the surgeon will
expend more resources to rescue the patient and thus raise cost without raising mortality. Our
data allow us to assess empirically which of these effects dominates.

To obtain empirical estimates of the impact of temporal distance on resource use we estimate the
following equation:
ln(costs) i,j,k,y = β0 + β1 ln(hospital volume) i,j + β2 ln(surgeon volume) i,k + β3 days since last
procedurei,j + β4 mortality + β5 Xi + ρj + φk + ψy + εi,j,k,y (7)
where costs are total inpatient costs.5 An indicator for the patient’s death before discharge (inhospital mortality) is included to avoid conflating differences in charges with differences in
patient mortality outcomes. All other covariates are defined as in the mortality model (2).

3.2 Robustness Checks
Increases in temporal distance could be correlated with unobserved determinants of patient
survival or hospital charges and thus endogenous. For instance, surgeons aware of and
concerned about skill depreciation might select relatively healthier patients to operate on
immediately after returning to work, in which case our mortality estimates would understate the
true impact of temporal breaks and any reduction in cost would be explained at least in part by
patient selection. If, on the other hand, surgeons returning to work triage patients in that they
operate first on those patients who are at highest risk of death, our mortality estimate will
overstate the true effect. To mitigate this endogeneity concern, we perform a series of robustness
checks.

As a first robustness check, we restrict the sample to patients who were admitted emergently and
thereby reduce further the possibility that selection on unobservables may be driving the results.6

5

We also estimated models where we looked at post-operative length of stay, a more objective

measure of resource use, and found the results to be consistent with the charges results.

When patients are admitted emergently, surgeons have little scope for patient selection, thereby
mitigating the effect of unobserved patient heterogeneity in confounding the measured effect of
temporal distance on outcomes. Moreover, as emergently admitted patients are typically more
acutely ill than electively admitted patients, the mortality outcomes for emergently admitted
patients should be particularly sensitive to surgeon skill and thus to the time since last
performing CABG or any inpatient procedure.

As a second robustness check, we restrict the sample to CABGs performed by surgeons
performing at least 100 CABG procedures per annum. This is the threshold used by the Leapfrog
Group, a coalition of large health care purchasers, to define high procedures volumes, which are
thought to improve performance. This robustness check mitigates the possibility that the
temporal distance effect could be confounded by systematic unobservable quality differences
between high and low volume surgeons and the severity of the patients they treat.7
Third, we test if temporal distance predicts differences in observable patient characteristics that
are likely correlated with unobserved patient severity or complexity. Specifically, we test
6

The Pennsylvania claims data we use indicate whether the patient’s procedure was emergent,

urgent or elective. These classifications are based on clinical criteria established by the National
Uniform Billing Committee.
7

We also estimated models with interaction terms for volume and temporal distance to

differentiate between the effects of volume and temporal distance directly. However, the
coefficients on the volume term and the interaction term were not significant. This could
indicate that low-volume surgeons typically treat otherwise healthier patients, which would mute
possible the inattention effects for that group.

whether temporal distance was is correlated with the number of patient comorbidities and with
the probability that the patient was admitted with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a common
marker of patient complexity.

3.3 Data
We use the Pennsylvania Inpatient Hospital Discharge Data from the Pennsylvania Health Care
Cost Containment Council (PHC4) from the third quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of
2010. The PHC4 data include patients' demographic characteristics, insurance coverage,
comorbid conditions as captured by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
Clinical Modification (ICD-9CM) codes, hospital identifiers, and surgeons’ license numbers.
From these data we identify all adults (age 18 years or older) undergoing CABG in Pennsylvania
hospitals using relevant procedure codes.8
3.3.1 Outcomes
We estimate the effect of the surgeon’s temporal break on two dimensions of performance: the
patient’s risk of death during hospitalization, and the natural logarithm of total hospitalization
cost. We use two mortality measures as proxies for overall procedure quality9: peri-procedural
mortality, defined as death within one day of the procedure, and in-hospital mortality, defined as
death at any time before discharge. The PHC4 data include hospital charges, which we convert
to cost using Medicare cost-to-charge ratios.
8

ICD-9 CM procedure codes 36.10-36.17 and 36.19.

9

The standard 30-day mortality measure is not available in these data because we only have

information through discharge from the current admission, and most patients are discharged
within a week of the procedure.

3.3.2 Time Since Last Procedure
We measure the covariate of interest, the time since the surgeon last performed surgery, in two
ways: the number of days since the surgeon last performed a CABG procedure and the number
of days since the surgeon last performed any inpatient procedure. PHC4 used restricted date-ofprocedure data to construct an additional variable coded as the number of days since the
operating physician was last listed as the operating physician for any inpatient procedure and a
variable indicating the sequence of all the records for which a physician was listed as the
operating physician.10

3.3.3 Provider Characteristics
We include hospital CABG volume and surgeon CABG volume. Both volume measures are
defined as the number of CABG procedures performed at the hospital or by the surgeon during
the 365 days leading up to each procedure included in the sample. We also include categorical
variables for hospital size (beds) and each physician’s years of experience, defined as the number
of years since graduation from medical school at the time of the procedure.

3.3.4 Patient and Discharge Characteristics
10

This was provided to us upon request from PHC4. In order to get access to this variable,

PHC4 had to remove day of week information from the data to limit the risk identification of
patients, and we are therefore unable to consider day of the week effects. However,
Hockenberry Lien and Chou (2008) examined this issue and found that “weekend effects” did
not explain the temporal distance effect on mortality.

Patient-level independent variables include patient age in years, gender, race/ethnicity indicators,
and primary payer (private payer, Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured). To capture the effect of comorbidities that might affect the outcome independently of the surgeon’s time since last
procedure, we also include a comorbidity index developed by Elixhauser et al. (1998), the
number of vessels bypassed (indicator variables from 1 to 4 or more), the type of admission
(elective, urgent, or emergent), an indicator that the admitting diagnosis was acute myocardial
infarction (AMI), and the number of days from patient admission to procedure (to capture the
effects of patients who were frail enough to require hospitalization for stabilization before the
procedure, or who were admitted for unrelated reasons and the vascular occlusion was
subsequently discovered). We also include indicators that the procedure included
cardiopulmonary bypass and that it included a concomitant valve procedure, as both indicate
potentially more complex procedures and more time under anesthesia, which in turn could affect
outcomes.

4. Results
4.1 Provider and Patient Characteristics
The study sample includes 56,315 discharges, 188 surgeons, and 62 hospitals. Mean 1-day
mortality was 0.62%, mean in-hospital mortality was 2.72%, and average total cost was $35,343.
For surgeons performing at least 100 CABG procedures per annum, mean 1-day mortality was
0.52%, mean in-hospital mortality was 2.47% and total cost was $32,900, consistent with the
hypothesis that high-volume providers are more efficient and effective. As would be expected,
emergently admitted patients had higher mortality rates and cost, and the procedures performed

by high-volume surgeons on this group again resulted in lower mortality and lower cost (Table
1).

The mean number of days since last performing any inpatient procedure was 1.99 for all
surgeons and 1.52 for high-volume surgeons. The number of days since last performing CABG
was 3.96 for all surgeons and 2.64 for high-volume surgeons. Figures 1 and 2 show the
distributions of the two measures of temporal distance for all physicians in the sample. Figure 3
shows the mean number of comorbid conditions among patients as a function of the number of
days since their surgeon last performed any inpatient procedure. Given the nature of the
condition and the procedure, most patients were elderly and covered primarily through Medicare.
Seven in ten patients were male and nearly ninety percent were white (Table 1).

4.2 The Effect of Temporal Breaks on Mortality
In the full sample, an additional day without performing any inpatient procedure was associated
with an increase in 1-day mortality by nearly 0.05 percentage points, or 7.4% relative to the
sample mean (Table 2). The absolute effect on in-hospital mortality was larger at nearly 0.07
percentage points, but on a relative basis it was smaller, 2.5%. The effect was smaller in relative
magnitude and not statistically significant when temporal distance was defined as days since last
CABG rather than last inpatient procedure.

The estimated impact of days since last inpatient procedure on mortality was larger in the
restricted samples. Among emergent patients (Table 2), an additional day increased 1-day
mortality by .11 percentage points (12.5%) and in-hospital mortality by .20 percentage points

(5.0%). Compared to 1-day mortality, temporal breaks had a larger absolute effect on in-hospital
mortality but their magnitude relative to in-hospital mortality was smaller.

Among all patients whose CABG was performed by a high-volume surgeon (Table 2), an
additional day away from the OR increased 1-day mortality by 0.09 percentage points (a 17.5%
relative effect) and in-hospital mortality by 0.17 percentage points (a 6.8% relative effect). In
contrast to the results for the full sample, a one-day increase in time since CABG also
significantly increased 1-day mortality by .03 percentage points and in-hospital mortality by .08
percentage points, effects that were still smaller in magnitude than the impacts from an
additional day since any inpatient procedure.

Finally, among emergently admitted patients whose CABG was performed by a high-volume
surgeon (Table 2), an additional day away from the OR increased 1-day mortality by 0.22
percentage points (31.5%) and in-hospital mortality by nearly a 0.40 percentage points (11.44%).
Again, a one day increase in time since CABG also significantly increased 1-day mortality by
nearly 0.08 percentage points and in-hospital mortality by nearly 0.21 percentage points, effects
that were still smaller in magnitude than the impacts from an additional day since any inpatient
procedure.

4.3 The Effect of Temporal Breaks on Costs
In the full sample, an additional day without performing any inpatient procedure was associated
with a statistically significant decrease in total cost of about 0.6 percent, or nearly $210 (Table
3). Consistent with the results for patient mortality, the reduction was only 1/6 as large at 0.1

percent, or $36, for an additional day since last performing CABG. In the case of emergently
admitted patients an additional day away from the OR reduced cost by about 0.8 percent, or
about $329. Again the impact was generally smaller when temporal distance was defined as the
number of days since last performing CABG, at 0.1 percent.

Finally, among those treated by a high volume surgeon, an additional day without performing
any inpatient procedure was associated with a statistically significant decrease in total cost of
about 1.1 percent, or nearly $349 (Table 3). The reduction was only 40% as large for an
additional day since CABG at 0.4 percent, or $141. In the case of emergently admitted patients
treated by high volume surgeons, an additional day away from the OR reduced cost by about 1.4
percent, or about $518.

Again, the impact was generally smaller when temporal distance was

defined as the number of days since last performing CABG, at 0.4 percent.

4.4 Robustness checks
To test whether there was evidence that our temporal distance effects were the result of selection
bias, we estimated a set of additional regression equations. If observed patient comorbidity or
the probability of the patient having an AMI at admission were associated with temporal
distance, this would indicate some patient selection. The results of these estimations are reported
in Table 4. As is evident, none of the point estimates of the effect of temporal distance on
patient comorbidity or AMI are precisely estimated, nor are they clinically significant. Since
comorbidity represents one of the main characteristics a surgeon would use to engage in
selection behavior, it is unlikely that our effects are driven by selection.

4.5 The Implied Cost of Saving an Additional Life-Year
We use the simultaneous increase in mortality and decrease in cost associated with increased
temporal distance to calculate the implied cost of saving an additional year of life. In Table 5 we
summarize the previous results and derive the implied cost per life-year saved for each
subsample. Specifically, we reproduce the percentage-point reduction in in-hospital mortality
associated with a shortening the temporal distance (defined as time since last inpatient
procedure) by one day and translate the mortality reduction into the implied increase in life
expectancy assuming that patients could expect to live an additional 17.6 years after surviving
CABG (van Domburg, Kappetein, and Bogers, 2009). The resulting cost per life-year saved
ranges from $7,871 to $18,500.

5. Discussion
We find that, after accounting for patient and provider characteristics, an additional day since the
surgeon’s last inpatient procedure raised peri-procedural mortality of CABG patients on average
by 7.4% and in-hospital mortality by 2.5%. Hockenberry, Lien and Chou (2008) found that the
impact of increasing time away to be monotonically increasing, so the implied cumulative effect
of several days away from the operating room on outcomes could be substantial. The large
effects we observe here are likely attributable to differences in how temporal distance was
measured. The earlier work used a reference group of 0-2 days and compared procedures
grouped into 2-14 day and 15+ day breaks. However, learning theory suggests that forgetting
follows an exponential or power function path. As such, the largest reductions in human capital
would occur in the first few of days.

In the data used here, most procedures were performed by surgeons who had been in the
operating room in the last 7 days. One might ask whether we expect surgeons to experience
skill depreciation so quickly. In fact, the industrial engineering literature suggests the
depreciation is quite rapid, and continues out for months. The more recent literature also finds
that this depreciation effect is independent of how quickly or how much learning was
accumulated (Jaber, 2011).

In this study, the data did not allow us to parse out which of the multiple skills that surgeons use
to perform CABG procedures were depreciating and how rapidly. They could be primarily
cognitive in nature and thus consistent with our hypothesis of inattentive care, which in turn is
supported by the results we report here. They could also include dexterity or the ability to
manage a surgical team. If it were possible to randomize surgeons to longer breaks from surgery
and measure these different types of skill, then one could estimate more accurately skill-specific
depreciation functions.

While temporal breaks raise mortality risk, we also find that they reduce the total cost of
hospitalization, again consistent with the inattentive-care hypothesis.11 The reduction in resource
11

Conceivably, the temporal-distance effects might be muted or even reversed for 30-day

mortality. For instance, surgeons returning from relatively short breaks away from the operating
room might also discharge patients sooner, i.e. before they die in-hospital. To test for this
possibility, we estimated multinomial logit models but found no evidence that the number of
days since performing any or a CABG procedure last was systematically associated with the
patient’s likelihood of being discharged to a skilled nursing facility rather than home. This

use after a practice interruption runs counter to studies of other settings, which found more inputs
were needed to produce a given unit of output as human capital declined (Argote, Beckman and
Epple, 1990; Benkard, 2000). However, the result is consistent with the hypothesis that surgeons
returning from a temporal break may be more likely to miss complications that arise during or
after the procedure. Surgeons who miss life-threatening complications raise their patients’
mortality risk but they also use fewer resources than surgeons who notice and address these
complications.

As in any study using administrative data, we were limited in the clinical information we could
bring to bear in our risk adjustment. Even after controlling for surgeon fixed effects, endogenous
scheduling of patients by severity may have confounded the estimates. For instance, surgeons
may have scheduled electively admitted patients with the least (unobserved) risk of lifethreatening complications to be treated after returning from longer temporal breaks. In this case,
we would underestimate the effect of days between procedures on patient mortality. To the
extent that unobserved patient characteristics on which the surgeons sort patients are correlated
with the patient severity measures that we do observe in our data, sorting on observables reveals
the likely extent of any bias imparted by unobserved heterogeneity (Altonji, Elder and Taber,
2005). In sensitivity analyses we examined the contribution of our clinical severity measures on
the effects of temporal distance. The effect estimates without the severity controls were slightly
finding is consistent with the fact that in our data the temporal distance effects for perioperative
mortality are qualitatively identical to those for in-hospital mortality. Borzecki et al. (2010) also
reported strong concordance between in-hospital and 30 day mortality across facilities for a
variety of conditions..

smaller in magnitude than in the adjusted model but still statistically significant. Assuming high
correlation between these observables and the unobserved severity characteristics, our estimates
of the temporal-distance effects should be viewed as conservative.

We also did not find any systematic association between temporal distance and other markers of
patient complexity, such as the number of comorbidities or the probability of having been
admitted with acute myocardial infarction. This is perhaps not too surprising, as the organization
of cardiac surgery and referral patterns vary widely across hospitals and markets, as do surgeons’
affiliations with hospitals (Berenson, Ginsburg and May, 2006). Cardiac surgeons still take call
with affiliated hospitals regardless of the employment relationship (i.e. employed by the hospital
or independent).

In addition, the PHC4 data did not include the time of day that each procedure was performed.
Thus, we had to use admission times to classify the first procedure of the day for the purpose of
assigning temporal distance. To the extent that we measured temporal distance with error, our
estimates would suffer from attenuation bias and again should be viewed as conservative.
Sensitivity analyses that included an indicator for procedures performed on a day with other
procedures did not materially change the estimated impact of temporal distance.

To minimize possible selection bias, we estimated the equations for the subsample of the
approximately 3 out of every 10 patients who were admitted emergently. The emergent nature of
the admission places a premium on timely decisions and interventions, which should be
particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the surgeon’s attention and application of skill. For these

reasons, estimates based on this subset of patients should be less vulnerable to selection bias and
more accurate in capturing the effect of temporal distance on mortality. For emergently admitted
patients essentially all the sorting is determined by a call schedule which is fixed ex ante. Of
course, it is possible that surgeons with below-average temporal-distance measures also succeed
in securing slots on the call schedule during which emergently admitted patients are healthier on
average. To minimize the confounding effect of this type of unobserved heterogeneity, we
included surgeon and hospital fixed effects. For both mortality measures and both measures of
temporal distance, we find larger effects on mortality and resource use.

As a second robustness check, we estimated the equations for the subsample of procedures
performed by high-volume surgeons. High-volume surgeons would be expected to develop more
effective routines than low-volume surgeons of maintaining their performance potential during a
break and of regaining it after a break, resulting in a smaller estimated effect size. On the other
hand, high-volume surgeons might be more likely to operate on patients with more complex, yet
unobserved disease and therefore more likely to miss a life-threatening complication. This would
be the case if low-volume providers are more selective and avoid emergently admitted patients,
allowing them to treat patients who are healthier and more robust than the acutely ill patients
treated by high-volume providers. Healthier patients are unlikely to die in the short term unless
the procedure was performed very poorly. For these patients, mortality may be too coarse a
measure to capture any temporal-distance effects on productivity. In addition, surgeons who
perform only a few procedures a year are away from the operating room for more days on
average than high-volume surgeons. Because our models include surgeon fixed effects, the
departures from their best performance may not be as pronounced. On balance, we did not find

statistically significant reductions in effect size for any of the measures of mortality and temporal
breaks; to the contrary, for several specifications the effect size increased when the sample was
limited to high-volume surgeons.

For patients who were admitted emergently and treated by a high-volume surgeon, extending the
surgeon’s temporal break by an additional day raised the patient’s 1-day mortality risk by 31.5%
and the in-hospital mortality risk by 11.4%.

In conclusion, we find that practice interruptions in the form of a surgeon’s additional day away
from the operating room raised patients’ mortality risk by up to 0.4 percentage points but
reduced the total cost of hospitalization by up to 1.4%.

Moreover, in both the outcome and spending models, the results were stronger when the
temporal distance since last performing any inpatient procedure was used rather than temporal
distance since last performing CABG. While an earlier study examined the temporal distance
between specific procedures only (Hockenberry, Lien and Chou, 2008), our estimates suggest
that the outcome and spending effects are largely accounted for by the depreciation of general
surgical human capital rather than procedure-specific human capital. Thus surgeons who are
performing other procedures between performing CABG appear to be able to maintain
proficiency, which is important in an era of declining CABG volume.

Our findings also raise the question which policies might mitigate the adverse impact of temporal
breaks on physician performance. If temporal breaks compromise focus or attention to possible

complications, as our results suggest, greater reliance on other members of the surgical team and
the use of surgical safety protocols and checklists may be warranted (Haynes, et al, 2009;
Birkmeyer 2010, de Vries et al. 2010). Such interventions aimed at aiding surgeons regain their
pre-break performance levels, along with changes in scheduling that reduce the average time
away from the operating room, might be justified if they improve expected patient outcomes
sufficiently. Our most conservative estimates imply that raising patients’ pre-operative life
expectancy by one year would raise costs by as little as $7,871, more than 25% less than the
median cost per life-year saved reported by a well-known study of over 500 medical
interventions (Tengs, Adams, Pliskin, et al, 1995).
