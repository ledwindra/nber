    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore a variety of models and approaches to bond pricing, including those associated with Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, Ho and Lee, and Heath-Jarrow-Morton, as well as models with jumps, multiple factors, and stochastic volatility.  We describe each model in a common theoretical framework and explain the reasoning underlying the choice of parameter values.  Our framework has continuous state variables but discrete time, which we regard as a convenient middle ground between the stochastic calculus of high theory and the binomial models of classroom fame.  In this setting, most of the models we examine are easily implemented on a spreadsheet.\n\n",
