    "abstract": "\n\nWe empirically characterize how China is internationalizing its bond market by staggering the entry of different types of foreign investors into its domestic market and propose a dynamic reputation model to explain this strategy. Our framework rationalizes China\u2019s strategy as trying to build credibility as a safe issuer while reducing the cost of capital flight. We use our framework to shed light on China\u2019s response to episodes of capital outflows.\n\n",
