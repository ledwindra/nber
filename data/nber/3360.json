Two important themes include (1) reasons to be interested in models of purely endogenous fluctuations, even though actual economics are admittedly subject to exogenous stochastic shocks; and (2) the importance  of market imperfections in making possible equilibria characterized by endogenous fluctuations of either of the two types.\n\n",
