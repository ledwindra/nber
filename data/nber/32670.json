    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper asks how search costs, limited awareness of schools, misperceptions of schools\u2019 attributes, and inaccurate beliefs over unknown schools affect families\u2019 search and application decisions in Chile\u2019s nation wide school choice process. We combine novel data on search activity with a panel of household surveys, administrative application data, randomized information experiments, and a model of demand and sequential search with subjective beliefs. Descriptively, households hold inaccurate beliefs and misperceptions along multiple dimensions which distort the perceived returns to search. Most importantly, they do not know all schools, and misperceive quality ratings of the schools they know and like. Improving the search technology would raise households\u2019 search effort and welfare. Correcting misperceptions about known schools\u2019 observables would cause students to match to schools with higher quality, equal to what can be achieved under a full-information benchmark. Models with out misperceptions would incorrectly predict quality reductions.\n\n",
