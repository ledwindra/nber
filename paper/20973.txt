ABSTRACT
Older wealthholders spend down assets much more slowly than predicted by classic life-cycle
models. This paper introduces health-dependent utility into a model in which preferences for
bequests, expenditures when in need of long-term care (LTC), and ordinary consumption
combine with health and longevity uncertainty to explain saving behavior. To sharply identify
motives, it develops strategic survey questions (SSQs) that elicit stated preferences. The model is
estimated using these SSQs and wealth data from the Vanguard Research Initiative. A robust
finding is that the desire to self-insure against long-term-care risk explains a substantial fraction
of the wealthholding of older Americans.

Introduction

The elementary life-cycle model predicts a strong pattern of dissaving in retirement. Yet this strong dissaving
is not observed empirically.1 Establishing what is wrong with the simple model is vital for understanding
behavior and the optimal design of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, retirement savings plans, and private
insurance products. Given the aging of the U.S. population, identifying the determinants of late-in-life saving
behavior is an increasingly important endeavor.
At present there is no consensus on why there is so little spend down of assets. Explanations typically
involve longevity risk and either bequest motives, precautionary motives associated with high late-in-life
health and long-term-care (LTC) expenses, or both, but the quantitative contribution of each motive is in
debate. Long-term-care needs are a quantitatively plausible driver of saving because the chance of needing
care is non-trivial and the costs of care are large. Around one third to one half of older Americans will
spend time in a nursing home and, according to the Genworth (2016) survey available at http://www.
longtermcare.gov, one year in a private room in a nursing home averages $92,000 and ranges from $55,000
to $250,000.2 This range in costs partially reflects large variation in quality of care and comfort, which
suggests spending when in need of long-term care involves a choice with an intensive margin reflecting the
utility of spending when in need of care.
Both bequest and health-related motives can by themselves generate the high levels of observed savings
late in life. Estimates of the importance of these motives range widely. Kopecky and Koreshkova (2014)
finds LTC expenses to be a significant driver of savings; De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) finds medical
expenses to be important in replicating the slow spend-down of wealth. Others, including Hubbard, Skinner,
and Zeldes (1994) and Palumbo (1999), estimate the contribution of such expenses to late-in-life savings to
be low. Bequests as a saving motive have been studied extensively, with Kotlikoff and Summers (1981)
and Hurd (1989) providing early analysis of the effect of a bequest motive on wealth decumulation. Most
recent empirical work models an end-of-life bequest motive with the non-homothetic utility functional form
proposed in De Nardi (2004). While such studies broadly agree that the bequest motive is present and
active primarily for richer individuals (and even found in Lupton and Kopczuk (2007) to be present for
individuals without children), its quantitative importance is debated. Lockwood (2018) estimates a bequest
utility function with high marginal utility in the relevant domain, which can by itself largely explain the high
saving rates of the elderly. Others such as De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) and Ameriks, Caplin, Laufer,
and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011) estimate the motive to be somewhat weaker, diminishing more rapidly in the
bequest level, leaving more room for health related saving motives to drive saving among the sample who
could feasibly purchase private LTC. See De Nardi, French, and Jones (2016b) for a survey of the literature
on savings after retirement.
We provide new estimates of the relative importance of bequest and precautionary motives. First, we
find that there is a significantly stronger preference for spending when in need of LTC than for leaving a
bequest. By estimating utility functions, we can show that the marginal utility from an additional dollar

Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2013) and Love, Palumbo, and Smith (2009) similarly show that household wealth is relatively stable
at later ages absent divorce or death of spouse.

spent is higher when in need of LTC than when leaving a bequest at all levels of expenditure. Also, reported
spending when faced with a hypothetical direct tradeoff between leaving a bequest or spending on self when
in need of LTC reveals a strong desire to spend when in need of LTC, even at the direct cost of leaving a
smaller bequest. Second, we show that features of the health and economic environment lead both of these
motives to contribute substantially to saving over the life cycle. Simulations of the full model, which takes
into account not just preferences but also the probabilities of health and death events and the availability of
government provided means-tested care, show that LTC-related and bequest motives are roughly coequal in
determining late-in-life saving, although the effect of each saving motive on saving behavior varies by wealth.
Our results derive from four interrelated innovations. The first concerns the modeling strategy. We build
a heterogeneous agent incomplete markets model of individuals, who save precautionarily when faced with
health risks, the potential need for long-term care, and an uncertain life span. People value consuming,
leaving a bequest, and receiving long-term care if they need it. From at least as early as Arrow (1974),
economists have postulated that utility may be state dependent and that health may be an important state
that determines utility. A critical element of our modeling strategy is to allow for an intensive margin of
LTC expenditure that is valued using a non-homothetic LTC-state dependent utility function. Specifically,
we model LTC utility symmetrically with the bequest utility function proposed in De Nardi (2004). Existing
models are asymmetric in this regard, allowing bequests to have a flexible state dependent utility, yet treating
long-term care as either a fixed expense or as a portion of standard consumption, sometimes with a distinct
marginal utility multiplier. Allowing this additional flexibility reflects the distinctive nature of the spending
options and desires when in need of long-term care. We also model the option for individuals to utilize the
publicly provided insurance against LTC and health risks. We incorporate these social insurance programs
as means-tested consumption floors, with a separate provision for LTC and non-LTC health states. While
clearly social insurance programs provide consumption for the U.S. population with no wealth, the perceived
value of these social insurance programs affects savings across the wealth distribution.3
Our second innovation is one of measurement. We develop a series of strategic survey questions (SSQs) to
help identify preference parameters (see Ameriks, Caplin, Laufer, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011) and Barsky,
Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997)). Our use of this variant of the stated preference method is related
to work by van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2008) and van der Klaauw (2012) by the use of non-behavioral
data to estimate structural model parameters. In contrast, those papers use subjective expectations data,
while we implement SSQs that elicit stated strategies in structured hypothetical scenarios to estimate utility
functions.
Our third innovation is our estimation approach. We estimate a structural life cycle model in the spirit
of De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010), French and Jones (2011), Lockwood (2018), and Gourinchas and
Parker (2002). Most importantly, we use not only standard behavioral data but also non-standard SSQ
3

For evidence on the effect of such social insurance programs see, e.g., Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995), Scholz, Seshadri,
and Khitatrakun (2006), Brown and Finkelstein (2008), Ameriks, Caplin, Laufer, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011) and Braun,
Kopecky, and Koreshkova (2017).

data to jointly estimate risk aversion, LTC utility parameters, and bequest utility parameters.4 While
our favored specification leverages both types of data and estimates the model jointly combining wealth
and SSQ moments, we also provide separate estimates using moments of the wealth distribution alone and
SSQs alone.5 Additionally, in order to perform this estimation, we develop a method to efficiently compute
optimal policies that builds on the endogenous grid method of Fella (2014). The individual’s value function
is non-concave in wealth, which generates discontinuous optimal saving policies. Efficient computation of
the optimal policies using this modified endogenous grid algorithm and parallelization greatly facilitates
estimation of the model.
Our final innovation relates to the sample. We derive our results in the context of a new sample,
the Vanguard Research Initiative (VRI), that explicitly targets the half of older Americans with non-trivial
financial assets and obtains high-quality measurements of wealth. While not randomly selected from the U.S.
population, we document in detail in Ameriks, Caplin, Lee, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2014) that this sample has
much in common with the appropriately conditioned Health and Retirement Study (HRS). In Section 9.2 we
show that our estimated model predicts well saving patterns out-of-sample in the HRS population. Analysis
of the VRI enables the use of SSQs while simultaneously providing new data on a previously under-sampled
relevant population for the question at hand.6
Ultimately, we examine the implications of the estimated preferences for savings and expenditure profiles.
These estimates suggest that spending when in need of long-term care is highly valued on the margin
4

In previous literature there have been two primary empirical strategies used to identify health-state dependent utility.
The first is to use panel data to analyze health profiles over time and the corresponding levels of consumption (Lillard and
Weiss (1997)) or utility proxies (Finkelstein, Luttmer, and Notowidigdo (2013)). The primary alternative has been to use a
compensating differentials approach (Viscusi and Evans (1990); Evans and Viscusi (1991)), asking survey respondents how much
they would need to be paid to compensate for hypothetical health risks, often in the context of physically dangerous jobs.
Finkelstein, Luttmer, and Notowidigdo (2009) provides an overview of the empirical strategies used to identify preferences in
poor health states. See Hong, Pijoan-Mas, and Rı́os-Rull (2015) for an alternative method using Euler equations to estimate
the effect of health on the marginal utility of consumption.
5
Our estimation procedure is related to other strategies in which stated choices are used to estimate models in the same
manner as are data on observed choices. For a recent example that highlights the similarities and differences between the classic
stated-preference and our strategic survey methodologies, see Blass, Lach, and Manski (2010). The closest paper to ours in this
dimension is Brown, Goda, and McGarry (2016), who use a related survey methodology to study the degree to which there
exists health-state dependent utility. As in our paper, they do find evidence of state dependence. They do not estimate a
state-dependent utility function.
6
Ameriks, Briggs, Caplin, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2018) uses the VRI to study the demand for insurance against the risk of
needing help with activities of daily living. It examines both model-implied and stated demands for idealized LTC insurance and
compares them to demand for LTC insurance that the market provides. The findings point to substantial unmet demand for
good LTC insurance and therefore points to imperfections and frictions in the insurance market. This paper has no insurance
market, so the hedge against risk is asset accumulation. Additionally, this paper presents a method-of-moments estimator
targeting wealth and SSQ data to estimate homogeneous preference parameters while Ameriks, Briggs, Caplin, Shapiro, and
Tonetti (2018) targets SSQs exclusively to estimate different parameters for each respondent.

and contributes substantially to savings.7 It is striking that this broad conclusion holds not only for the
estimates based on both wealth and SSQ data, but also for either type of data taken in isolation. With
the flexible health-state utility functional form, even estimates targeting exclusively the traditionally-used
wealth moments suggest the importance of LTC for savings, but imprecisely. Combining SSQ and wealth
moments confirms that much of late-in-life saving is driven by LTC-related desires by providing much sharper
identification of preferences.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the model; Section 3 describes
the financial and demographic data in the VRI; Section 4 details the strategic survey questions; Section 5
describes the estimation methodology that allows us to estimate the structural life cycle model without (and
with) data on observed behavior; Section 6 presents our baseline parameter estimates obtained by matching
both wealth and SSQ moments; Section 7 examines the resulting behavioral implications of the estimated
preferences; Section 8 compares our baseline estimates to those obtained by exclusively targeting either
wealth moments or SSQ moments to disentangle the relative contribution of the SSQs and also compares the
baseline estimates to those found in the literature; Section 9 performs sensitivity analysis by re-estimating
the model under alternative model and parameter assumptions; Section 10 concludes.

The Model

2.1

Individual States

Individuals are heterogeneous over wealth (a ∈ [0, ∞)), age (t ∈ {55, 56, ..., 108}), income age-profile (y ∈
{y1 , y2 , . . . , y5 } with yk = {yk (t)}Tt=55 ), sex (g ∈ {m, f }), health status (s ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}), and health cost (h ∼
Hg (t, s)). Time is discrete and the life-cycle horizon is finite. Each period, consumers choose consumption
(c), savings (a0 ), and whether to use government care (G ∈ {0, 1}). The model groups consumers into five
income groups with deterministic age-income profiles. For tractability, we abstract from labor-income risk
which, while essential to model for younger individuals, is less a determinant of behavior for older individuals
out of the labor force or near retirement who have a larger ratio of financial to human wealth.8 Assets receive
a risk free rate of return of (1 + r) on savings. Thus, the only uncertainty an individual has is over health
and death.
7

In contrast to our findings, Koijen, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Yogo (2016), who allow for similar motives, but use different
estimation methods and data on the observed demand for insurance products, find a strong preference for leaving a bequest and
a lower marginal utility when in poor health. Similarly, while not featuring health-specific utility, Lockwood (2018) matches
moments of the cross-sectional wealth distribution and LTC insurance demand by cohort and finds a strong preference to leave
a bequest. The findings of low utility when in need of LTC result from matching low holdings of long-term care insurance.
Low LTCI ownership could arise because the poor quality LTC insurance products available in the market are worse than the
idealized state-contingent assets in the model. See Ameriks, Briggs, Caplin, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2018) for analysis of LTCI
demand that makes the distinction between idealized and actual insurance products, which reconciles why individuals may have
a strong preference to spend when in need of help with LTC and simultaneously not buy LTCI.
8
The model abstracts from labor supply decisions, including retirement. These labor market decisions are taken into account
through the exogenous income profiles.

2.2

Health and Death

There are four health states: s = 0 represents good health, s = 1 represents poor health, s = 2 represents
the need for long-term care (LTC), and s = 3 represents death. People are defined to need LTC (s=2) if
they need help with the activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, eating, dressing, walking across
a room, or getting in or out of bed. Thus, state 2 is interchangeably referred to as the LTC or ADL state.
The health state evolves according to a Markov process, where the probability matrix, πg (s0 |t, s) is sex,
age, and health state dependent. Health status affects the distribution of out-of-pocket health expenditure
shocks and the distribution of health status in the following year (including mortality risk). Out-of-pocket
health expenditures (h) are lognormally distributed as a function of age, health status, and sex. Section
5.1.2 describes the mapping of health variables between model and data.
Health-State Dependent and Bequest Utility. In addition to affecting health costs and survival
probabilities, health status affects preferences. There is a health-dependent utility function, such that
spending when a consumer needs LTC is valued differently than spending when a consumer does not need
LTC. When in good or poor health (s ∈ {0, 1}), consumers value consumption according to standard CRRA
preferences with parameter γ > 0:
Us∈{0,1} (c) =

c1−γ
.
1−γ

(1)

Utility when in need of help with LTC (s = 2) associated with chosen expenditure level c is:
Us=2 (c) = (θADL )−γ

(c + κADL )1−γ
.
1−γ

(2)

Upon death (s = 3), the agent receives no income and pays all mandatory health costs. Any remaining
wealth is left as a bequest, b, which the consumer values with a warm glow utility function:
v(b) = (θbeq )−γ

(b + κbeq )1−γ
.
1−γ

(3)

When an individual is healthy or sick, utility is given by a power utility function of consumption. Bequests
are valued using the standard warm glow utility function developed in De Nardi (2004). When an individual
needs long-term care, utility is given by a similar formula, which treats LTC and bequests symmetrically
in theory, allowing differences in preferences to be determined empirically through estimated parameter
differences.9 Two key parameters are θ and κ; θ affects the marginal utility of an additional dollar spent and
9

We follow most papers in this literature, e.g., De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010, 2016a) and Lockwood (2018), by using the
same exponent in the healthy and bequest utility functions. We explore the sensitivity of our results to allowing for a bequestspecific exponent, γbeq , in Section 9. De Nardi, French, and Jones (2016a) also model a health-state dependent utility function
to study late-in-life saving patterns. Their focus is on medical spending more generally among a less wealthy population; they
model an additively separable homothetic medical expenditure utility function with a marginal utility multiplier that varies as a
function of nursing home need and other medical states (e.g., broken bones). By contrast, our health-dependent utility function
is over total consumption in the LTC state and represents non-homothetic preferences via κADL . Thus, our parameterization
provides the LTC utility function the same flexibility as the bequest utility function in terms of generating varied spending and
saving behavior across wealth levels.

5

κ controls the degree to which an expenditure is valued as a luxury good or a necessity, in the sense that
it provides a utility floor or need. Since it is raised to the power −γ, increases in θ decrease the marginal
utility of a unit of expenditure. κ allows the model to represent non-homothetic preferences; an increase in
κ indicates that the expenditure is valued as more of a luxury good; negative κ can be interpreted as the
expenditure being a necessity.

2.3

Government

A person always has the option to use a means-tested government provided care program. The cost of
using government care is that a consumer’s wealth is set to zero, while the benefit is that the government
provides predetermined levels of expenditure, which depend on the health status of the individual. If a
person chooses to use government care when not in need of LTC (i.e., when s = 0, 1), then the government
provides a consumption floor, c = ωG , that is designed to represent welfare.
If an individual needs LTC (s = 2), then he or she must either purchase private long-term care or use
government care. Capturing the fact that LTC provision is essential for those in need and private long-term
care is expensive, there is a minimum level of expenditure needed to obtain private LTC parameterized by
χ, i.e., c ≥ χ if s = 2 for those not using government care. In the model, government-provided care is loosely
based on the institutions of Medicaid. If a person needs LTC and uses government care, the government
provides c = ψG . The value ψG parameterizes the individual’s value of public care, since that parameter
determines the utility of an individual who needs LTC and chooses to use government care.

2.4

The Individual Problem

The individual takes r as given and chooses a0 , c, and G to maximize utility. This problem, written recursively, is,
V (a, y, t, s, h, g) = 0max Is6=3 (1 − G)
a , c, G

+ Is6=3 G





Us (c) + βE[V (a0 , y, t + 1, s0 , h0 )]

Us (ωG , ψG ) + βE[V (0, y, t + 1, s0 , h0 )] + Is=3 {v(b)}

s.t.
a0 = (1 − G)[(1 + r)a + y(t) − c − h] ≥ 0
c ≥ χ if (G = 0 ∧ s = 2)
c = ψG if (G = 1 ∧ s = 2)
c = ωG if (G = 1 ∧ (s = 0 ∨ s = 1))
b = max{(1 + r)a − h0 , 0}
Us (c) = Is∈{0,1}
v(b) = (θbeq )−γ

c1−γ
(c + κADL )1−γ
+ Is=2 (θADL )−γ
1−γ

1−γ
(b + κbeq )
.
1−γ

The value function has three components, corresponding to the utility plus expected continuation value of a
living individual who chooses not to use government care, that of one who chooses to use government care,

6

and the warm glow bequest utility of the newly deceased individual.10 G = 1 if the consumer chooses to use
government care and G = 0 if the consumer chooses not to use government care. A person using government
care has expenditure levels set to predetermined public care levels and zero next-period wealth. The budget
constraint shows that wealth next period is equal to zero if government care is used, and is otherwise equal
to the return on savings plus income minus chosen expenditures minus the health cost shock. The individual
cannot borrow, cannot leave a negative bequest, and private expenditure when in need of LTC must be at
least χ.

2.5

Describing Optimal Behavior

In this section, we explore key properties of optimal individual behavior to illustrate how each force in the
model contributes to consumption and savings patterns over the life cycle and across the income and wealth
distributions. The individual’s saving behavior is largely determined by the confounding influence of the
precautionary saving motive and bequest motive in the presence of government policies. Long-term care
needs occur with non-trivial probability and paying for such care privately is very costly. The fact that the
government offers a means-tested public care option induces interesting behavior. Because the individual
has the option to choose government care, the value function is non-concave and the optimal saving policy
is discontinuous. The model does not permit analytic solutions and must be solved numerically, with details
of our solution algorithm presented in “Vanguard Research Initiative Technical Report: Long-term Care
Model.”11
Discontinuous saving policies. The option to use means-tested government care induces discontinuous
saving policies, in a manner similar to that studied in Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995). Roughly
speaking, very high wealth individuals have enough savings to ensure they will obtain a high level of personal
consumption and leave a large bequest, regardless of whether or not they need to pay for private longterm care. For low wealth individuals, even if they saved almost all of their money and consumed very
small amounts each year, they would not be able to save enough to make it optimal for them to purchase
private long-term care if they eventually needed it. Thus, it is the middle-wealth people—like those in the
VRI—whose actions are most likely to be affected by precautionary saving motives. If these middle-wealth
individuals are frugal and save, they will have enough wealth to purchase private LTC if they need it late in
life. If they do not save, but rather consume at a high rate over their life cycle, they will have higher utility
when alive and healthy, but will forgo a bequest and rely on public provision of LTC if they need it later
in life. There exists some threshold wealth level, conditional on all other idiosyncratic state variables, such
that it is optimal for all agents with more wealth to follow the frugal path and for all agents below to follow
the spendthrift path, with a discrete difference in their saving policy for a tiny difference in their wealth
state. To illustrate optimal consumer behavior we present model simulations at certain parameter values.
Parameters will be estimated and discussed further in Section 6.2.
10

Technically, there is a fifth health state that is reached (with certainty) only in the period after death and is the absorbing
state, so that the consumer only receives the value of a bequest in the first period of death.
11
The non-concavity of the value function and the discontinuity in the optimal savings policy introduce computational complications. We use a modified endogenous grid method, building on insights from Fella (2014). The model solves approximately
ten times faster when using the modified endogenous grid algorithm compared to value function iteration, which is essential
since estimation of the model requires computational efficiency.

7

Fig. 1.—Saving Policy Discontinuity. Assets a, $1000s.

The discontinuity of the saving policy is demonstrated in Figure 1 by plotting the objective function that
corresponds to the non-optimized value function across saving policies for different initial levels of wealth.
That is, plotted on the horizontal axis is age t + 1 wealth, and on the vertical axis is the value associated
with that amount of saving. The three lines depict the graph for an individual with identical states aside
from the three different age-t wealth levels: $33K in the red dashed line, $36K in the solid black line, and
$39K in the dotted blue line.
In this example, the optimal value of saving for the low wealth individual is zero. This person is forgoing
all precautionary saving and consuming as much as possible today. The higher wealth individual has enough
money that it is worth it to save to help smooth consumption across states and time. This can be seen in
the top line, in which the maximum of the value function is achieved with savings around $32K, attaining
a significantly higher value than if this individual saved zero. As presented in the middle line, there exists
an age-t wealth level for which the global maximum value jumps from the lower to the higher savings local
maxima. An individual with $33K in this example is near indifferent between saving around $31K and
saving zero. It is around this level of current wealth where there is a discrete jump in the optimal saving
policy (the value function is kinked, but remains continuous).
How preferences and states determine saving behavior.

Saving decisions are ultimately determined

by the preferences of individuals and by their environment. As was highlighted by Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes
(2002), a dollar saved today is fungible in its future use. Saving early in the person’s life could be to insure
against future uncertain events like LTC as well as to ensure suitable savings remain at end of life to leave
a desired bequest. If the bequest motive is weak, over-saving for an uncertain late-in-life event that never
occurs is costly, as the individual would much rather have had a smooth higher consumption path over his
life. However, with a strong bequest motive, “extra” savings at the end of life are highly valued, which
reduces the cost of ex-post over-saving.
To demonstrate how savings are influenced by bequest and LTC-induced saving motives, we plot various
age-profiles for wealth and expenditure for a simulated individual, in response to different sequences of

health shocks, for different initial states, and for different preference parameters. Unless otherwise stated,
the figures plot the wealth and expenditure profiles of a male who starts healthy at age 55 and has the
median income profile, median wealth, and preference parameters from our preferred baseline estimation.
Unshaded areas indicate behavior when healthy (s = 0) while gray-shaded regions indicate behavior when
in need of long-term care (s = 2). It is important to note that these patterns will not be representative of
wealth and expenditure profiles of the population, as these are individuals and shocks selected to illustrate
the workings of the model and are not necessarily typical or representative of the VRI sample or the U.S.
population.
As a baseline, Figure 2 shows the wealth and consumption paths of a man who receives a shock sequence
such that he remains in good health until death at T = 108. Wealth accumulates until age 75 and then
steadily decumulates with age. Early on the individual saves, driven by a combination of LTC and bequest
motives. As the individual ages, the probability of needing LTC for any given year tends to increase, but
eventually the chance that LTC will be needed for any given large number of years decreases. The increase in
consumption with age occurs because the individual was saving precautionarily for LTC and as he continues
to receive such a good run of positive health shocks, he starts to consume the ex-post extra savings slowly.
Figure 3a demonstrates the rapid dissaving and high expenditure associated with the need for LTC. This
person received health shocks such that he was healthy his entire simulated life, except for one period in
which he needed LTC for ages 74-76, highlighted by the gray shaded region. At the onset of needing LTC,
expenditures jump from around $60,000 per year to around $110,000 per year, resulting in a large decrease
in wealth. Expenditure remains high and roughly constant during the three year LTC period, as savings
decline rapidly. After three years of LTC, the individual steadily dissaves and consumes, as no other adverse
health shocks occur until death. Saving and expenditure behavior depend on an individual’s level of wealth.
Figure 3b plots the behavior of an individual that is similar in all ways except for having lower wealth at
age 55. The low wealth individual saves more aggressively early on in order to build a buffer stock of wealth
in case LTC is needed and in order to be able to leave a bequest. Similar patterns of rapid dissaving and
high levels of expenditure are associated with the LTC event. However, the low wealth individual actually
increases wealth after exiting long-term care to return to a desired buffer-stock level of wealth.

Figure 4a documents the behavior of a lower wealth individual who also has the lower first-quintile income
profile. Furthermore, compared to the previous figure, in this simulation his need for LTC lasts for nine
years instead of three. At first he purchases private LTC, but the high level of expenditure associated with
his need for LTC depletes his wealth to near zero, at which point he chooses to use publicly provided LTC
for the rest of his LTC episode, and then live hand to mouth afterwards. Note that public-care expenditure
(dashed line) is included in the total expenditure reported.12 Figure 4b shows what happens if the individual
started at age 55 with $30,000 in savings instead of $100,000. He consumes very little and saves up until
he needs LTC. His wealth is so low that he immediately uses public care as soon as he needs LTC. When
he no longer needs public care, he simply consumes his roughly $20,000 a year income. As is apparent, the
need for extended LTC rapidly depletes savings and can lead to extended periods of low consumption for
the remainder of life.
Quantitatively, the levels of expenditure are quite reasonable across the wealth and income distribution.
An individual who has $750,000 in wealth at age 74 and earns around $50,000 a year spends around $110,000
a year during a three-year LTC stay, while an individual who has $150,000 in wealth at age 74 and earns
$20,000 a year spends around $70,000 a year for the same three-year LTC stay.

(b) Strong Bequest Utility

These saving and expenditure patterns are strongly influenced by people’s preferences. To demonstrate
the importance of the health-state utility function, Figure 5a recreates the simulation presented in Figure
3a, except for an individual with preferences such that spending when in need of long-term care is valued
just as spending when healthy (θADL = 1, κADL = 0). The original behavior induced by baseline preferences
is drawn with dashed lines and that associated with alternative preferences is drawn with solid lines. This
analysis shows that much of the increase in wealth during the individual’s 50’s and 60’s was driven by the
precautionary saving motive associated with LTC. Furthermore, expenditure levels when in need of longterm care are much closer to expenditure when healthy, with a slight uptick due to the increased mortality
risk associated with the worse health state. This major change in expenditure patterns foreshadows that
our estimated health-state utility function induces higher marginal utility of expenditure when in need of

LTC, not less.
Both the health-state utility function and the bequest function affect saving and spending behavior.
Figure 5b plots the life-cycle behavior of the same median wealth and income individual, but with parameters
such that bequests are more strongly valued. As can be seen, the stronger bequest motive increases savings
early on. Furthermore, the stronger bequest motive has a significant effect on late-in-life wealth levels,
leading an individual to reach age 100 with near double the wealth of the baseline individual. This person
needed to save so much early on because he had a strong desire to spend when in need of LTC and to leave a
bequest. Later in life, expenditure patterns look similar, because consumption similar to that in the baseline
case can be sustained without depleting wealth, due to the higher level of financial income generated by a
larger stock of wealth.

Fig. 6. —Wealth and Expenditure Profiles with (black dotted line) and without (blue solid line) Health-State Utility
for Different Health Paths.

Finally, to give a sense of the effect of health-state utility on saving and bequest behavior in the data, we
plot in Figure 6a a more typical health pattern in which a median wealth and income man is healthy from age
55 to 84, needs LTC for age 85–89, and then dies. The figure plots wealth over the life cycle with the baseline
parameters and also with no ADL-state utility. Without ADL-state utility, this person accumulates wealth
roughly from ages 55 to 70, and then starts steadily dissaving. When in need of LTC, his rate of dissaving
is only marginally faster, driven by changes in life expectancy. In contrast, with the baseline ADL-state
utility function, this person accumulates wealth more rapidly from age 55-70 and continues to accumulate
wealth until age 80. Furthermore, when the negative health shock realizes, dissaving is rapid, driven by the
higher utility of expenditure in this health state. This desire to spend when in need of help with ADLs is to
a large degree why he was saving in the first place. In this scenario, the baseline parameterization results
in almost double the bequest compared to the no ADL-state utility case, even with the rapid health-related
spend down at the end of life due to the increased precautionary saving earlier in life. Many people die
without ever needing long-term care. Figure 6b plots savings over the life cycle for a man who is healthy
until death at age 100, with and without the health-state utility function. This figure demonstrates that
the health-related precautionary saving motive generates a large incidental bequest even though there is the
typical spend down late in life due to mortality risk absent LTC needs.
12

With an understanding of the key features of optimal saving behavior in the model and how they relate
to important state and parameter values, we turn to a description of the data, with which these parameter
values will be estimated.

Financial and Demographic Data

In order to examine late-in-life wealth patterns, it is essential to have data on a population with large enough
financial resources to face non-trivial spending, saving, and giving decisions. This paper draws on the newly
developed Vanguard Research Initiative (VRI) that combines survey and administrative account data. In
this section we briefly describe the VRI, highlighting the advantages of the sample population for addressing
the question at hand.
The VRI consists of approximately 9,000 individuals drawn from Vanguard account holders who are
at least 55 years old. Additionally, we require Vanguard assets of at least $10,000 (to assure non-trivial
engagement with Vanguard) and Internet registration with Vanguard (to allow for surveys administered
over the Internet). As a point of comparison, the VRI is cross-sectionally about the same size as the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS) and around 4 times larger than the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) in
the relevant age group. Surveys are administered over the Internet and ask respondents about their and
their spouse’s or partner’s wealth, income, and decision-making motives.
A sample drawn from Vanguard account holders is, of course, not random or representative of the U.S.
population. For example, by design, the sample is drawn from individuals who have positive financial wealth.
Hence, we exclude the large fraction of households who approach or reach retirement age with little or no
financial assets. Use of this new dataset is a significant contribution of this paper. It provides a large sample
of older Americans with sufficient financial assets to face meaningful trade-offs between consumption across
time, between spending when well and when in need of assistance, between long-term care in private or
publicly-funded facilities, and between leaving bequests versus spending while alive.
Since we do not explicitly model the family, in this paper we restrict our data to only include single
respondents, who were oversampled to ensure a large single subsample. For the remainder of this paper we
focus on a sample of 1,241 singles with no missing survey responses to mandatory questions.
For points of comparison, we construct “VRI-eligible” subsets of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
and the Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) by imposing sample screens to parallel the VRI: age 55 years
and older, financial assets of at least $10,000, and access to the Internet. After imposing these screens, the
characteristics of the VRI sample are similar in many dimensions to these subsets of the 2012 HRS and
2013 SCF, representing individuals in roughly the upper half of the wealth distribution. Financial wealth is
defined as the sum of IRA, employer sponsored retirement, checking, saving, money market, mutual fund,
certificate of deposit, brokerage, and educational related accounts plus the current cash value (if any) of
life insurance and annuities. Income is defined as the sum of labor income, publicly and privately provided
pensions, and disability income. Table 1 compares wealth and income of the VRI and VRI-eligible subsets of
the HRS and SCF restricted to the single households considered in this paper. Our sample is well positioned
to complement existing samples with a highly relevant population. In Table 1, we see VRI respondents have
more wealth than the VRI-eligible HRS and SCF respondents, but the differences are much less stark than
compared to the overall population, which has close to zero wealth at the median. Furthermore, although

Note.—Financial wealth is the sum of IRA, employer sponsored retirement, checking, saving, money market,
mutual fund, certificate of deposit, brokerage, and educational related accounts plus the current cash value
(if any) of life insurance and annuities. Income is defined as the sum of labor income, publicly and privately
provided pensions, and disability income. The sample comprises single households meeting VRI sample
screens: age 55 years and older; assets of at least $10,000, and Internet access. Income is total household
income (excluding distributions from defined-contribution pension plans). Data are from the 2014 HRS and
the 2013 SCF. See Ameriks, Caplin, Lee, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2014), Appendices B and C, for a discussion
of the definitions of variables in the HRS and SCF and for a detailed comparison of the VRI, HRS, and SCF.
the income is somewhat higher in the VRI than in the VRI-eligible HRS, the VRI and the VRI-eligible SCF
have very similar levels of income. A downside of using VRI data is that we only have a cross-section of
measurements, which does not allow us to adjust for cohort or time effects and may reflect mortality bias.
For more details we refer the reader to Ameriks, Caplin, Lee, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2014), which provides
an exhaustive analysis of the VRI, both on the survey methodology that measures wealth from an accountsbased construct and on the resulting collected data. For the purposes of this paper, it is most important to
note that the VRI contains high quality measures of individuals’ wealth and income and, crucially, responses
to SSQs that were specifically designed to identify parameters of the model just developed. The VRI also
has measures of self-reported health status and need for help with activities of daily living, elicited using the
same questions as in the HRS that we use to estimate health-state transition matrices. To estimate both
the health-state transition probabilities and the out-of-pocket health expenditure shock distributions, we use
HRS panel data, as detailed in Section 5.

Strategic Survey Questions

SSQs are stated-preference questions, with scenarios that are quite closely linked to important life decisions
faced by our respondents. Behavior in the model is driven by the preferences of individuals and the economic
14

environment in which they make choices. Since a main goal of this paper is to identify the relative contributions of different saving motives associated with different preferences, it would be ideal if survey respondents
could accurately and directly report their preference parameters. Of course, we can not ask survey respondents to report their coefficient of relative risk aversion, much less θADL . Thus, if we want to develop direct
measures of preferences, we need to develop survey instruments that allow respondents to provide us with
information that identifies preference parameters in a language in which they are comfortable, but also in a
format that allows a precise mapping to structural parameters of interest.
Along these lines, revealed preference methodology uses observed choices to perform inference about
preferences. If a utility function is assumed to represent preferences, often these observed behaviors can
be used to estimate preference parameters. In a similar vein, we develop strategic survey questions that
use choices made in hypothetical scenarios to estimate preference parameters. In constructing our survey,
we create a highly structured hypothetical environment with a very restricted choice set that allows us
to make fewer assumptions on the unspecified economic environment. Though necessarily incomplete per
se, our scenarios are significantly more detailed than in typical hypothetical questions. Our questions are
designed to provide the survey respondent precise details on all relevant individual states of the world
from the perspective of the structural model. SSQs ask the respondent to comprehend and imagine complex
scenarios. As with any hypothetical question, there are legitimate concerns about whether survey respondents
can understand the scenario and whether they can respond from the perspective of that scenario. To make
these tasks as easy as possible for the survey participant, we paid close attention to the presentation of the
material and developed the survey with input from survey design experts and cognitive psychologists in a
process of exploratory cognitive interviews, pilot surveys, and then production surveys; we also perform tests
of respondent comprehension and of the coherence and consistency of responses to address such concerns.
See Section 4.3 for analysis of SSQ responses and Ameriks, Briggs, Caplin, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2018) for
further evidence on the credibility and coherence of SSQ responses.
The SSQs are one ingredient in our overall estimation strategy to identify preference parameters. We
treat each individual as an optimizer in a specific problem and characterize the individual by financial and
demographic variables and preference parameters. The SSQs ask people to make choices that would be
very revealing about their preference parameters if only we were to observe them making such choices. A
key feature of the SSQ approach is that it provides data about the priority of LTC risks and desires for all
individuals in the sample, not just the ones who end up needing LTC. We add as moments in the GMM
estimation the mean of each SSQ so that we are estimating preferences of an optimizer who would answer
the SSQs in a manner consistent with the central tendencies of how the survey respondents answered the
SSQs. Because these are deep structural preference parameters, they also affect all other behavior of these
modeled individuals, including their saving behavior. In addition to the SSQs, we include wealth moments
conditional on age to make sure our optimizing individual has preferences that are also consistent with the
saving behavior of our survey respondents. There is a weighting matrix that determines the weight on the
different moments, but all moments are informative of all preference parameters. In the context of this
study, it turns out that two very different types of individuals could equally well have generated the wealth
data: one with strong bequest motives and weaker LTC-related spending desires or vice versa. The SSQs
allow us to sharply identify behavior that is only weakly identified in the wealth data alone: an individual
with a very strong active bequest motive and weak LTC utility would not answer the SSQs as the survey

15

respondents did, while an individual with strong LTC utility and a somewhat weaker active bequest motive
would answer the SSQs like our survey respondents.

4.1

Detailing SSQ 2: Spending in Good Health vs. when Needing LTC

Ultimately the model is estimated on responses from four types of SSQs and wealth data. In this section,
we will first illustrate the key features of SSQs by detailing one particular SSQ related to LTC (SSQ 2) and
then we will present the other three SSQs. In Section 5, we detail more precisely how we construct moments
and use model simulations to estimate parameters.
In SSQ 2, we are interested in understanding how individuals trade off having wealth in states of the
world when they do not need LTC and when they do need LTC. At the core of the question, we are asking
individuals to solve a simple portfolio allocation problem. The researchers specify that the respondent has
some wealth (W ), faces some chance they will need LTC (1 − π) and some chance they will not need LTC
(π), and that they must allocate their resources by purchasing state-contingent assets (z1 , z2 ) given a relative
price of z2 (p2 ) to finance expenditure in the two possible states of the world. In the survey, we set p2 =

1
1−π .

The mathematical representation of the survey question that we use for estimation is:
max
z1 ,z2

(θADL )−γ (z2 + κADL )1−γ
z11−γ
+ (1 − π)
π
1−γ
1−γ

s.t.

(4)

z1 + p2 z2 ≤ W
z1 , z2 ≥ 0; z2 ≥ −κADL .

Identification. The first order condition of the optimization problem gives the optimal allocation as a
function of preference parameters. By inverting this function, we map the allocations chosen by survey
respondents to preference parameters. For example, the optimal decision rule of the above problem is given
by:

z2 =

The scenario exogenously specifies π and W . By obtaining responses for two different combinations of
W and π for which allocations to both states are positive, we are able to identify θADL and κADL , given γ.
Combining these with the results of SSQ 1 that identify γ we are thus able to identify all three parameters
from responses to these questions.
The key survey design challenge is that most individuals can not understand the allocation problem in
the mathematical language of optimal control. We present below the SSQ that is designed to help survey
respondents provide (z1 , z2 ) such that they are making a choice that we are confident corresponds to that
in the optimization problem, but in a format in which they are capable of doing so. Identification for all
preference parameters proceeds similarly, as demonstrated below.

16

Survey Design. To ease respondent comprehension these questions are presented in five steps. In the
first screen, we begin by telling the respondent explicitly what trade-off we are asking them to think about.
This is done to prompt the respondent to weigh the relevant risks we are interested in, and to alleviate
their concern over not understanding the point of the question and guessing about the motives of the survey
designers. Second, the question presents the specific scenario and details the choices that the respondent
must make. This screen is the complete scenario, and is made available to the respondents as they are giving
their final answers if they would like to check any features of the scenario. Third, we present a set of rules
that further defines the environment and clarifies the span of options and resources available to the survey
respondent in each scenario. Fourth, we verify comprehension and reinforce key features of the question with
a set of multiple choice questions about the scenario. Finally, we record an answer using a custom-designed
interactive slider. See Ameriks, Briggs, Caplin, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2018) for a detailed discussion of the
SSQ design process and further analysis of individual responses that demonstrate the credibility of SSQs.
The Scenario. The survey instrument first states the scenario precisely, but as simply as possible consistent with being precise. Specifically, the survey displays a screen with the following text.13
We are interested in how you trade off your desire for resources when you do and when you do not
need help with activities of daily living (ADLs). This scenario is hypothetical and does not reflect a
choice you are likely ever to face.
Suppose you are 80 years old, live alone, rent your home, and pay all your own bills. Suppose that
there is a chance that you will need help with ADLs in the next year. If you need help with ADLs you
will need long-term care.
• There is a 25% chance that you will need help with ADLs for all of next year.
• There is a 75% chance that you will not need any help at all with ADLs for all of next year.
You have $100,000 to divide between two plans for the next year. This choice will affect your
finances for next year alone. At the end of next year you will be offered the same choice with another
$100,000 for the following year.
• Plan C is hypothetical ADL insurance that gives you money if you do need help with ADLs.
– For every $1 you put in Plan C, you will get $4 to spend if you need help with ADLs.
– From that money, you will need to pay all your expenses including long-term care at home or
in a nursing home and any other wants, needs, and discretionary purchases.
• Plan D gives you money only if you do not need help with ADLs.
– For every $1 you put in Plan D, you will get $1 to spend if you do not need help with ADLs.
– From that money, you will need to pay for all of your wants, needs, and discretionary purchases.
13

In previous sections of the survey the definition of “needing help with ADLs” is given and understanding is verified. Further,
a reminder of this definition appears if respondents move their mouse over the word “ADLs” in the scenario.

Presenting the Rules of the Scenario.

Immediately after the scenario is presented, the respondents

are provided with a recap and elaboration of the specific rules that govern their choice. This recaps the
previous screen but is presented in a bulleted, easy to read format. In addition, some features which were
hinted at in the first screen, e.g., that there is no public care option and that determination of which plan
pays out is made by an impartial third party, are stated explicitly. These rules are designed to ensure that
the word problem corresponds as closely as possible to the intended optimal control problem.
• You can only spend money from Plan C or Plan D next year. You do not have any other money.
• If you want to be able to spend whether or not you need help with ADLs, you need to put money
into both plans.
• If you need help with ADLs, all money in Plan D is lost.
• If you do not need help with ADLs, all money in Plan C is lost.
• Any money that is not spent at the end of next year cannot be saved for the future, be given away,
or be left as a bequest.
• You must make your choice before you know whether you need help with ADLs. Once you make
your choice, you cannot change how you split your money.
• Regardless of whether or not you need help with ADLs, your hospital, doctor bills, and medications
are completely paid by insurance.
• Other than Plan C, you have no other resources available to help with your long-term care. You
have to pay for any long-term care you may need from Plan C.
• There is no public-care option or Medicaid if you do not have enough money to pay for a
nursing home or other long-term care.
• An impartial third party that you trust will verify whether or not you need help with ADLs
immediately, impartially, and with complete accuracy.

Verification Questions. In order to reinforce details of the scenario and measure comprehension, we ask
the respondents a sequence of questions about the specifics of the scenario, including payoffs in different
states, potential uses of money, potential expenses, and rules regarding the payouts. When answering these
questions the respondents do not have access to the screens describing the scenario, but have a chance to
review the information before retrying any missed questions a second time. If the respondents fail to answer
questions correctly a second time, they are presented the correct answers. As documented in Ameriks,
Briggs, Caplin, Shapiro, and Tonetti (2018), the vast majority of individuals answered almost all verification
questions correctly before recording their responses to the strategic survey questions.
Recording the Response. Having reinforced and measured understanding, we are finally prepared to ask
the question: how would respondents split their wealth between the two plans? After again presenting them
with the original scenario, we present them a screen—a snapshot is shown in Figure 7—with a link in the top
right corner to the full scenario. The responses are recorded through an interactive slider that we developed
for the purpose of eliciting responses to SSQs. The slider allows the respondent to experiment with different
answers and dynamically displays the trade-offs implicit in the SSQs—in this case the trade-off between
spending when well and spending when needing LTC. The axis is not labeled with dollar amounts. Instead,
18

Fig. 7.—SSQ 2 Response Screen.

the screen contains indications that moving the slider right places more money in Plan D and moving to the
left places more money in Plan C. These amounts are displayed dynamically at the ends of the slider. See
http://ebp-projects.isr.umich.edu/VRI/survey_2.html for an interactive demonstration of the SSQ
survey instrument including the slider.
This mode of presentation likely contributes to the high-quality responses we were able to elicit to the
SSQs. Use of the slider is effective because it summarizes the key tradeoff in each of the SSQs and allows the
respondent to see how the tradeoff operates. The implementation of the slider also addresses several issues
with surveys in general. First, there is no value on the slider when it is first presented. The respondent
must click to establish an initial value. Second, the survey asks the respondent to move the slider from this
initial point (and indeed requires that they do so before recording a response). Together, these two features
of the presentation serve to reduce the effect of anchoring. Indeed, we observe little effect of a respondent’s
first click on their final answer.
After recording a response to this initial question, we ask two variations of this SSQ with different
wealth levels and probabilities of needing LTC. This provides further information about how they value
having wealth in different states and provides us with a consistency check of individual choices.

4.2

Overview of the Other SSQs

In addition to the SSQ presented above that examines the trade-off between wealth when in need and not
in need of assistance with ADLs, the survey presents three other SSQs that examine trade-offs that are
relevant to understanding the late-in-life saving motives. Like the previously presented SSQ, these questions
present situations which individuals may be unlikely ever to face. Yet, they capture the same type and scale
of risks and tradeoffs that individuals do need to confront in making lifetime saving decisions. The choices
that individuals make when confronted with these hypothetical situations provide information regarding the

relative values of having wealth in different states of the world. These three additional SSQs are outlined
below and the full text of all four SSQs, as well as histograms of the survey responses, are available in “VRI
Technical Report: Strategic Survey Questions.”
SSQ 1: Risk Aversion. The first type of SSQ posed is a modified version of the Barsky, Juster, Kimball,
and Shapiro (1997) question which examines an individual’s willingness to trade a certain lifetime income for
a lottery over lifetime income that has a higher expected payoff. Their original question measured tolerance
for risk, and has been used frequently to identify the coefficient of relative risk aversion parameter in a power
utility function. In the VRI formulation, we refine this question by specifying a more precise environment
in which age, health expense, labor income, unexpected expenses, and outside sources of wealth are all
controlled for. More generally, the framing of SSQ1 relative to BJKS represents an evolution of thought
favoring being more explicit about the precise environment of SSQ scenarios at the expense of having longer
and more complex survey questions. We also make the decision a (repeated) static choice, by allowing
the individuals to only bet over a single year’s spending at one time. This significant departure from the
standard BJKS formulation is necessary to avoid confusion with late-in-life health-state utility and bequest
preferences.
Specifically, in the VRI question we present individuals an option of choosing between two plans that
affect their consumption for the upcoming one year. The first plan guarantees $100,000 for certain, and
the second plan will with 50 percent probability double income to $200,000 and with 50 percent probability
20

reduce income by some fraction. The individuals are then asked a series of questions that categorize them
into ranges of proportional losses that they would be willing to risk, and then prompted to provide a point
estimate of the largest possible loss for which they would choose the risky lottery over the certain income
option. SSQ 1 follows BJKS by asking about preference over discrete gambles. At the end of the sequence,
SSQ 1 uses plain language to ask respondents to provide the ξ that satisfies

with the choice of ξ point-identifying γ. A variant of this question is then presented, comparing lotteries to
$50,000 in certain income.
SSQ 3: Bequest vs. LTC Utility. In the third type of SSQ that we posed (the second being described
in the previous section), we ask individuals to make an irreversible portfolio decision that allocates money
between bequests and expenditure while alive when the individuals need help with ADLs. This question,
which is similar to one posed in Ameriks, Caplin, Laufer, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011), removes the
possibility of an incidental bequest and thus allows us to focus on an intentional bequest motive. Because
bequests observed in standard data sources also include unused precautionary savings, it is difficult to identify
how strong the bequest motive is. By removing the option of saving money usable for both precautionary and
bequest purposes, we are able to separately identify the relative strength of the two motives. To formulate
this question, we present individuals with $100,000 and tell them that they have exactly one year left to
live. Furthermore, they will need help with ADLs for the entire year. They then must allocate money
between two plans, the first that is available for them to spend during the coming year but can not be left
as a bequest, and the second that is only accessible as a bequest upon their death. This response is then
recorded and the individuals are asked how their portfolio allocation would change if they had $150,000 or
$200,000 of wealth. SSQ 3 maps to the following optimization problem:

z1 , z2 ≥ 0; z1 ≥ −κADL ; z2 ≥ −κbeq .

SSQ 4: The Value of Public Care. In the final SSQ, we focus on an individual’s willingness to utilize
public LTC. The environment is similar to that of SSQ 3 in that the respondents are told they only have
one year to live, told they will need help with ADLs for the entire year, and the only two spending channels
accessible to them are spending on themselves during the year and leaving money as a bequest. In this
scenario there is a publicly funded care option that is available to them. Using the public care option will
allow them to leave all of their wealth as a bequest, but they will receive the level of care that a typical public
care facility would provide. We then ask for the level of wealth at which they would be indifferent between
taking public care and paying for their own. Intuitively, for extremely low levels of wealth the respondents
are likely to utilize public care, as they are unable to adequately fund their own care and a bequest. For
wealth levels sufficiently high, they are likely to fund their own care as the value of public care becomes
small compared to the value of private care and the total expenditures on LTC become small relative to
21

their desired bequest level. This suggests there will be an interior response that provides a measure of the
equivalent dollar amount an individual assigns to receiving public care. Ultimately, to identify ψG SSQ 4
asks respondents to provide the W that satisfies:
(θbeq )−γ (W + κbeq )1−γ
(θbeq )−γ (W − z1 + κbeq )1−γ
(θADL )−γ (ψG + κADL )1−γ
(θADL )−γ (z1 + κADL )1−γ

where z1 is the optimal policy when there is no public care, as calculated in SSQ 3.
Identification. Because different utility functions are active in different states, different preference parameters control the marginal utility trade-offs that determine the decisions in each state of the world (see Table
2 to see which parameters influence optimal decisions in each SSQ). For instance, SSQ 1 asks individuals to
make a risky bet regarding consumption when healthy and explicitly rules out the potential that this decision could influence consumption in other health states. Since relative risk aversion parameter γ is the only
parameter which determines marginal utilities in the active states, this question identifies risk aversion. SSQ
2 examines the trade-off between having wealth when healthy and when in need of LTC with ADLs. This
trade-off is optimally determined (abstracting from corner solutions for the moment) by equating marginal
utility in the healthy state as determined by γ with marginal utility when in need of help, as determined
by γ, θADL , and κADL . Utilizing the observed trade-offs at different wealth levels and state probabilities,
we thus are able to identify the θADL and κADL necessary to align the model with SSQ responses. SSQ 3
examines a similar trade-off between wealth when in need of help with ADLs and wealth for a bequest, while
SSQ 4 examines how the existence of a government LTC consumption floor effects the trade-off. In both
of these questions, the model implied optimal strategy is dictated by the marginal value of wealth in the
ADL state (again, determined by γ, θADL , and κADL ) and the marginal value of wealth allocated towards a
final bequest (determined by γ, θbeq , and κbeq ), while in the fourth SSQ the respondent must also take into
account how the existence of a public care option affects this trade-off by determining how much he values
public care (ψG ).

4.3

Descriptive Analysis of SSQ Responses

In this section, we seek to describe how the SSQ responses will ultimately inform the formal estimation of
preference parameters. We do so by analyzing the histograms of responses to the three variants of SSQ 2
and three variants of SSQ 3, which are the questions most unique to our paper and most informative of
the LTC and bequest utility parameters. “VRI Technical Report: Strategic Survey Questions” presents the
histogram of responses for all SSQ questions.
In Figures 8a, 8b, and 8c we observe how individuals tradeoff consuming when healthy and consuming
when in need of LTC, across wealth levels and different probabilities of needing care. As documented in
Figure 8a, when the probability of needing LTC is 0.25 and people had $100K to allocate between the LTC
state and the healthy state, most people allocated between $30-$50K to the LTC state. Since the relative
price of the LTC state contingent asset in the survey was set to

1
1−π ,

respondents would have

1
1−π

times

their chosen allocation available for spending in the LTC state. Thus, these choices reflect the respondents
desire to have around $120-$200K available when they need LTC and $50-$70K available when they do not
need LTC. Figure 8b shows the response distribution when the probability of needing LTC is increased to

0.5. In this case, more people allocate around $40-$70K to the LTC state, resulting in around $80-$140K
when in need of care and $40-$60K when healthy. Thus, when the probability of needing care is higher,
people chose to sacrifice consumption when healthy to keep significant resources available when in need of
care. For most respondents, both consumption when healthy and when in need of care are lower, reflecting
a tough tradeoff on the margin. That is, respondents do not fix a set amount of wealth in either the healthy
or LTC state with the other state receiving the residual. Figure 8c plots the responses when people only
have $50K in wealth for the year. Most people choose to allocate between $10K-$30K to the LTC state,
delivering $40-$120K when in need of LTC and $20-$40K when healthy. Again, even when resources are
tight, people are choosing to divert significant funds away from the healthy state towards the LTC state,
but are keeping substantial amounts for the healthy state as well. For all SSQ 2 variants, most respondents
allocate resources so that they have more available in the LTC state than in the healthy state, often much
more. These choices imply that LTC is a high marginal utility state, generating low θADL and negative

Fig. 9.—Allocations to the LTC state in SSQ 3 at Different Wealth Levels.

In Figures 9a, 9b, and 9c we observe how individuals trade off leaving money as a bequest and having
wealth when in the ADL state, across wealth levels of $100K, $150K, and $200K, respectively, the three
variants of the bequest SSQ 3. The histograms show the amount that the individual would allocate towards
the ADL state. Here, we clearly see that individuals react to the wealth level. Many respondents allocate
almost all of their portfolio to the ADL state when wealth is $100K. When wealth is $150K, it is evident
23

that the wealth constraint in scenario 3a severely restricts spending in the ADL state, as evidenced by the
large mass of individuals responding with allocations to the ADL state above $100K. Similar patterns repeat
when wealth is $200K, with significant response mass above $150K. Furthermore, even at $200K, many
individuals gave zero bequest. This finding suggests that many people view LTC as a primary reason to save
late in life at lower wealth levels, with bequest motives becoming more important at higher wealth levels.
These responses are consistent with the view that bequests are considered a luxury good while LTC is a
necessary good, which should be reflected in estimates of κADL and κbeq . It is harder to read directly how
these responses translate into θADL and θbeq , especially as parameters are jointly estimated using all SSQs.
These figures indicate, however, that estimators that target SSQ moments are likely to result in parameter
estimates that indicate a strong desire to spend when in need of LTC compared to leaving a bequest. Having
provided some descriptive evidence on how the SSQ responses will inform parameter estimates, we turn to
the formal estimation strategy.

5

Estimation Methodology

We develop a two stage Method of Simulated Moments (MSM) estimator that is similar to those used in
De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010), French and Jones (2011), Lockwood (2018), Gourinchas and Parker
(2002), and Laibson, Repetto, and Tobacman (2007) to estimate parameter set Γ. Γ := [Ξ, Θ] is divided
into two subsets, with the first subset, Ξ, consisting of parameters externally estimated without the use of
the structural model (e.g., income, health transitions, and health costs) and the second parameter subset,
Θ := {γ, θADL , κADL , θbeq , κbeq , ψG }, consisting of preference parameters that are estimated using moments
generated by simulating the structural model.
First, we set some parameters to values informed by the literature and explore robustness to these
externally chosen values. We restrict β = 0.97 and ωG = $30K, as the empirical strategy using SSQs was
not designed to estimate these parameters. The VRI sample is wealthy enough such that almost no one
chooses to go on government welfare when healthy, and thus parameter estimates are identical for a wide
range of ωG .14

5.1
5.1.1

Estimated Inputs for the Model
Income

Income profiles are estimated from VRI Survey 1. In Survey 1, respondents report their income flows as
the sum of labor income, pension and disability payments, and social security payments. For each age,
we assign respondents to an income quintile based on their current rank amongst individuals of the same
age. Using this cross-section of income, we use a quintile regression to estimate the age profile of earnings
as a polynomial of age and sex. Since life-cycle parameters are estimated off the cross-section, we cannot
14

β is not identified from the SSQs. If β is estimated when targeting wealth moments, it is usually estimated to be close to 1
in order to help the model generate the large degree of wealth present in the upper deciles of the empirical wealth distribution.
The effect of this on the other estimated parameters is not large. Robustness to alternative values of β are presented in Section
9. We pre-set ωG = $30K for all exercises because that is the point estimate—although with very large standard errors—when
including this parameter to be estimated in our preferred baseline.

24

control for cohort effects. The model groups consumers into five income groups with deterministic ageincome profiles determined by the estimated coefficients. This allows us to capture income changes during
retirement, but abstract from income fluctuations as a source of uncertainty. The estimated age profiles of
income for each quintile are presented in Appendix A.1.
5.1.2

Health Transitions

Health transitions are estimated using HRS waves 2 through 10. We first apply the same sample selection
criteria of the VRI to the HRS data to obtain a population with similar observable characteristics. This
accounts for the fact that the VRI is wealthier and more educated than the U.S. population and health
transition probabilities vary substantially in these dimensions. Then we construct the defined health states
(s = 0, 1, 2) from two sets of questions. The first utilizes self-reported subjective health status questions
to classify individuals into good or bad health (s = 0 or s = 1).15 The second set of questions is used
to determine whether an individual is in the LTC/ADL state (s = 2). This set of questions presents five
activities of daily living and asks whether respondents receive help with any of the five activities. If the
respondent answers yes to any of these questions, then we define that respondent to be in the ADL health
state.16 Transitions are then estimated using a maximum likelihood estimator, with more information on
the estimation methodology and the resulting estimates provided in Appendix A.2.
Given the HRS data, there are two alternative LTC/ADL state definitions that are feasible: needing
help with ADLs or being in a nursing home. We prefer to use the “receive help” variable to define the ADL
health state for two reasons. First, being in a nursing home is too restrictive to represent the general health
status of needing help with ADLs. There are many people who need help with ADLs who do not reside in
a nursing home and even when in need of help with ADLs, people may spend on goods other than LTC.
Second, it is difficult to interpret a report of needing help, but not receiving help, as really needing help.
Thus, we choose the more general needing help with ADLs status, but the more stringent requirement that
they actually report receiving help. For consistency, this is the same ADL definition presented in the VRI
survey.
5.1.3

Health Expense

The health expense distributions are estimated using the 2010 HRS data. We model the mandatory out-ofpocket health expenditures as being distributed log normally and estimate the mean and standard deviation
of the lognormal distribution conditional on age, sex, and health state. Because idiosyncratic health cost is
distributed iid conditional on states, a single year of cross-sectional data is sufficient for estimation. For the
VRI sample studied here, out-of-pocket (post-insurance) health cost shocks are relatively small compared to
total wealth and thus do not substantively drive saving in the model. We use a measure of health costs that
15

Individuals are defined as in good health if they report health being good, very good, or excellent, and are defined to be in
bad health if they report health being poor or fair. Self-reported assessments of health status have strong predictive power for
future health realizations.
16
Results on saving behavior are robust to using receiving help with at least 2 or at least 3 ADLs as the cutoff for being in the
(s = 2) state; the effect of a lower probability of needing help with ADLs and the increased mortality rate associated with the
more severe definition of s = 2 is offset by the increase in persistence of the s = 2 state. Results of these alternative thresholds
are presented in Section 9.

25

includes many subcategories of expenditure and it is difficult to construct an ideal measure of exogenous
expenditure for our purposes from the HRS; reassuringly, the key results in this paper are virtually unchanged
over a large range in assumptions about these medical expenditure shocks, as documented in Section 9. For
more information on the estimation of costs and the resulting estimates see Appendix A.2.

5.2

Second Stage Estimates

In the second stage, we apply the MSM estimation procedure. The moments we use to estimate the model are
derived from two distinct survey measurements. The first set of moment conditions is derived from behavioral
data. We target age-conditional wealth percentiles, which are frequently used to estimate similar life-cycle
saving models. A second set of moments is derived from SSQ responses. We first describe the estimator,
and then detail the construction of both sets of moments and present the comprehensive moment set we
target in our baseline estimation. In Section 6 we present and analyze the resulting baseline parameters.
Furthermore, by design of the SSQ questions, it is possible to estimate the model using only wealth or only
SSQ moments, which we explore in Section 8.1.
We define X = (Xi )Ii=1 as the collection of measurements for all individuals, including behavioral responses, SSQ responses, and state variables; xi ⊆ Xi is used to denote relevant subsets of individual i’s data.
The moments used for estimation are the difference between statistics
generated by the
h
i structural model
(m(Ξ̂, Θ, X)) and empirical data (s(X)), defined as g(Ξ̂, Θ, X) = E m(Ξ̂, Θ, X) − s(X) . We estimate second stage parameters Θ̂ that minimize a GMM quadratic objective function with moments g(Ξ̂, Θ, X). That
is, the second stage estimator with weighting matrix W is:
Θ̂ = arg min g(Ξ̂, Θ, X)0 W g(Ξ̂, Θ, X).
Θ

(7)

To estimate the model with the optimal weighting matrix, we use the standard two-step feasible MSM
approach. In the first step we minimize the objective function defined in equation 7 using the identity
weighting matrix, and denote the minimizing parameter set Θ̂1 . Using this parameter set, we calculate the
moment vector g(Ξ̂, Θ̂1 , X) and the implied first-step covariance matrix Ω̂1 . We use the inverse of the firststep covariance matrix as the second-step optimal weighting matrix Ŵ = Ω̂−1
1 . We then minimize according
to equation 7 using Ŵ to estimate the final parameter set Θ̂.
5.2.1

Wealth Moments

As is common with many life cycle studies of late-in-life savings (e.g., De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010),
Gustman and Steinmeier (1986), Lockwood (2018)), the first moment set consists of asset percentiles, conditional on a set of state variables x. The simulated wealth percentile p conditional on state variables x
is denoted as apx (Ξ, Θ, X), while ai denotes individual i’s empirical wealth holdings. The wealth moments
conditional on x are:
h
i
gp,x (Ξ̂, Θ, X) = E I{ai <apx (Ξ,Θ,X)} − p|xi = x ,

(8)

an expression which can easily be converted to an unconditional expectation through the Law of Iterated
Expectations.
26

For our baseline, we define the moment conditions as the 25th , 50th , and 75th percentiles conditional
on age t (apt ). In practice, we aggregate the age profiles into disjoint three year intervals, so that t ∈
{55 − 57, 58 − 60, ..., 88 − 90}.17 This aggregation is done to smooth noise in the empirical asset profile that
we observe in the cross-sectional data. Given the three targeted wealth percentiles for each of the 12 age
intervals, the wealth moment set has 36 moments.
To generate the simulated wealth moments, we first solve the model to compute optimal decision rules
as a function of all relevant state variables given parameters. We simulate the model for a large number
of individuals (N = 10, 000) and then compute moments using the simulated behavior. To set the initial
conditions for the simulation, we sample (with replacement) N individuals from the VRI data X, in which
an individual is characterized by his or her vector of idiosyncratic state variables. Then, for each individual,
we draw relevant shocks from the Ξ̂ parameterized stochastic processes and simulate the behavior implied
by the computed optimal policies (given parameters Θ). We then aggregate these individual behaviors to
construct the simulated population moments m(Ξ̂, Θ, X), pooling observations from different calendar years
into age bins.
5.2.2

Strategic Survey Question Moments

The second moment set is constructed entirely from SSQ responses. The structural model has 6 preference
parameters to be estimated: relative risk aversion parameter, γ; LTC state utility parameters, θADL and
κADL ; bequest utility parameters, θbeq and κbeq ; and public-care aversion, ψG . Using responses to the four
types of SSQs described in Section 4.2 and their iterations at different wealth levels and state probabilities,
we are able to identify these six parameters. Since the survey poses two variants of SSQ1, three variants of
SSQ 2, 3 variants of SSQ 3, and one variant of SSQ 4, and we are estimating 6 preference parameters, using
SSQ data alone we have an over-identified system suitable for estimation of these six preference parameters.
As moments, we match the model implied allocations to the empirical mean of each of the 9 SSQ
i be individual i0 s response to SSQ variant m. The theoretical
variants, indexed by m ∈ {1, 2, ..., 9}. Let zm

counterparts, the optimal SSQ answers conditional on preference parameters, are denoted as sm (Θ). We
then write each moment as:


i
gm (Ξ̂, Θ, X) = E sm (Θ) − zm
,

(9)

providing us with 9 SSQ moments.
5.2.3

Combining Wealth and SSQ Moments

In the previous two sections we described the specification of wealth and strategic survey moments. In this
section we describe our baseline estimation procedure that uses both SSQ and wealth data by combining
these moments into a single moment vector that will be used to estimate the model. Utilizing both sources
of information disciplines the estimator to match wealth data and SSQ data, with each source of data likely
containing unique information. To combine the two sources of data, we concatenate the wealth moments
17

We stop matching wealth moments when the sample for the age group becomes too small, defined as less than 20 individuals.
This first occurs in the 91-94 age bin. Results are not sensitive around a reasonable range of the chosen cutoff.

27

formed from matching the cross-sectional wealth distribution percentiles and the SSQ moments formed by
matching the empirical SSQ responses, resulting in a total of 45 moment conditions.
Letting gV (Ξ̂, Θ, X) denote the set of moments constructed from wealth data and gS (Ξ̂, Θ, X) denote a
set of moments constructed from SSQ data, the baseline joint estimation’s moment set is
"
gJ (Ξ̂, Θ, X) =

#
gV (Ξ̂, Θ, X)
gS (Ξ̂, Θ, X)

.

(10)

By design, SSQ moments provide strong identification of the preference parameters, and thus the optimal
weighting matrix assigns a disproportionate amount of weight to the SSQ moments, resulting in tight match
of SSQ responses but a slight underprediction of wealth accumulation. In order to better match these wealth
moments, which are the common target of other studies, and to help facilitate comparison to the literature,
we make use of a parameter, λ, that allows us to control the relative importance we assign to each moment
set, gV (Ξ̂, Θ̂, X) and gS (Ξ̂, Θ̂, X). By over-weighting the wealth moments relative to the statistically optimal
weighting matrix, we arrive at our baseline estimator.18

Before presenting the parameter estimates, we show the fit of the model to the data. Figures 10a and 10b
document the model fit from our baseline estimation that jointly targets both wealth and SSQ moments. For
exposition, we present the SSQ moments on a [0, 1] scale, by normalizing the mean response by the maximum
possible response.19 Overall, the fit is good: the percentiles of the wealth distribution are matched well, as
18

See the Online Appendix for results using the optimal weighting matrix. Baseline estimates are quantitatively similar to
those using the optimal weighting matrix. This similarity holds for a wide range of λ, suggesting the implications of preferences
for saving, expenditure, and bequests are robust to this choice.

Because there is no maximum response to SSQ 4, we set Wm to be the 95th percentile of the response distribution.

of the SSQs and wealth moments in Section 8.

6.2

Baseline Estimated Parameter Values

Table 3 presents the parameter estimates for our baseline case that combines the wealth and SSQ moments.
Of particular interest in the estimation are four groups of parameters. First, the estimate of risk aversion
(γ) is of independent interest, but is also important because it is jointly estimated and strongly affects the
estimated values of other preference parameters. Second, the estimates of health state utility (θADL and
κADL ) presented are the first we are aware of to estimate this functional form applied specifically to the
LTC health state. Third are the bequest parameters θbeq and κbeq . Finally, ψG controls the degree to which
there is public-care aversion.

Note.—Standard errors are reported in parentheses.
The coefficient of relative risk aversion is estimated to be 5.27. This value is somewhat larger than that
typically used in the literature and somewhat smaller than that typically estimated using similar survey
techniques. For example, in an exercise using a similar model and very different data De Nardi, French, and
Jones (2010) estimate γ = 3.8, while Kimball, Sahm, and Shapiro (2008) estimate a mean γ of 8.2 when
using responses in the HRS to hypothetical lotteries over future income streams.
In examining the estimated preferences when targeting the joint moments, it is striking that the healthstate utility function implies very different marginal utility of wealth in the state of the world when an
individual needs LTC and when LTC is not needed. The estimated κADL = −37.44 is negative and large,
suggesting LTC is viewed as a necessary good with a spending floor of about $37K.20 θADL = 0.67 implies
a high marginal utility of expenditure in the LTC state, especially when combined with κADL . Note that
if κADL = 0, relative to ordinary consumption, θADL > 1 would imply that LTC expenditures provide less
marginal utility for each dollar spent while θADL < 1 would imply a higher marginal utility for each dollar
expenditure. Individuals with θADL > 1 and κADL < 0 would view expenditure when in need of LTC as
a strong necessity and so would optimally desire to consume the necessary amount, but not much more.
Thus, the effect of precautionary savings on wealth accumulation would be similar to medical expenses
such as those presented in De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010). For individuals with θADL < 1, marginal
expenditures in the LTC state would have a high value, so there is a motive to have additional spending
when in need of care even at expenditures above the necessary amount.
20

In our baseline, we set the minimum private LTC expenditure χ = $40, 000. The estimation results are independent of the
choice of χ for any χ ≤ −κADL and χ is quantitatively irrelevant when greater than but close to −κADL as is the case here.

29

For a given amount of spending, individuals have a higher marginal utility of spending in the LTC state
than from leaving a bequest. First, κbeq = 7.83, which implies that bequests are viewed as a luxury good.
Together with a positive κbeq , the estimate of θbeq = 1.09 implies a low marginal utility of bequests, relative
to LTC. As discussed in Section 8.2, estimates in the literature, like those from Lockwood (2018) and Koijen,
Van Nieuwerburgh, and Yogo (2016), find stronger bequest motives.
Because expenditure when in need of LTC is so highly valued, ψG = $77, 430 is estimated to be large. To
facilitate comparison to the literature, this estimate implies an equivalent utility level to that provided by a
$24,395 government provided public-care expenditure in a model with the same risk aversion, but without
state dependent preferences.21

7

Behavioral Implications of Estimated Preferences

To help further interpret the parameter values in economically meaningful ways and to investigate the
contribution of the different saving motives in determining life-cycle wealth patterns, in this section we use
the model to document behavior induced by the estimated preferences. We first do so in a simple static
optimization problem to give a sense of the curvature of the estimated utility functions, before turning to
an examination of expenditure in the estimated full model.

7.1

An Illustrative Synthetic Static Choice Problem

As a first pass on interpreting the estimated parameters, we plot optimal allocations in a simple synthetic
static choice problem, in which an individual regards consumption when healthy, when in need of LTC, and
bequests as three different “goods” that can be purchased simultaneously at a relative price of 1 and are
valued according to the corresponding estimated utility functions. This problem is not one that maps to a
situation ever faced by individuals; for example, there is no probability weighting to reflect the likelihood
of being in each state. It is nonetheless a convenient illustration device to present the marginal utility of
expenditures by health status implied by the estimated parameters before turning to the full model that
incorporates dynamics, risk, and government insurance. Specifically, the static allocation problem for a
person with wealth W is:
max

z1 ,z2 ,z3

(θbeq )−γ (z3 + κbeq )1−γ
(z1 )1−γ
(θADL )−γ (z2 + κADL )1−γ

1−γ
1−γ

(11)

s.t. z1 + z2 + z3 ≤ W
z1 , z2 , z3 ≥ 0; z2 ≥ −κADL ; z3 ≥ −κbeq .
Recall that this synthetic choice models is meant to summarize the parameters implications succinctly, not
to provide quantitative predictions reflecting an actual choice problem. The main advantage of this simple
choice problem is transparency, as the interaction between motives that is expressed in the full dynamic
model makes it challenging to easily determine the relative strength of each motive.

To calculate this expenditure equivalent in a model without the health state utility function, we find the expenditure level

Wealth ($1000)

Fig. 11. Expenditure in Synthetic Static Choice Problem.

Figure 11 plots the resulting optimal allocations. The most striking feature of this figure is that ADLstate expenditure is allocated the majority of wealth up to rather high wealth levels. Because ADL-state
expenditure is a necessary good at least −κADL dollars are always allocated to this motive, giving rise to
an initial ADL-allocation share nearly equal to 1 that falls as wealth is allocated to other expenditures to
take advantage of diminishing marginal utility from any one type of expenditure. In addition, we see that
because bequests are estimated to be a luxury good, there is initially no spending on bequests until wealth is
sufficiently high that the bequest motive becomes active. The effect on expenditure of the non-homotheticity
parameter κ diminishes at higher wealth levels and the differences in θ become more dominant. Even at
high wealth levels, people spend the most on the ADL-state good, then the ordinary-state good, followed by
a bequest. Although the outcome of a simple synthetic static optimization problem, these results highlight
that the estimated utility functions reflect a strong desire to spend when in need of help with LTC and a
relatively weak preference for leaving a bequest, which will contribute to life-cycle saving behavior in the
full dynamic model with health and mortality risk.

7.2

Implied Expenditures using the Baseline Model

In this section, using the full estimated model, we analyze expenditure behavior over the life cycle and in
the cross section.22 The simulated expenditures show the implications of the parameter estimates on an
important non-targeted dimension and provide credibility for the quantitative behavior of the model.
We begin by documenting the cross-section of expenditure across health status in Figure 12. The heterogeneity in expenditure comes from differences in income, wealth, age, sex, and the realization of health
shocks. When in good health, the modal expenditure is around $40K, with a long upper tail. As alluded to
when analyzing the estimated parameters, spending when in need of LTC is higher than when healthy. When
in need of LTC, over 60 percent of people spend around $80K to $100K. Furthermore, there are around 15
percent of people spending over $150K when in need of LTC and 5 percent spending over $200K. Median
22

Expenditure is defined as c + h, summing all voluntary expenditure and the mandatory out-of-pocket health cost shocks.
These expenditures result from the same simulations used to construct the wealth moments.

31

spending when in need of LTC increases by about $50K per year, from around $40K when in good health
to $90K.
Although modeled expenditure reflects total expenditure when in the ADL state, to get a sense of
comparison to the data, we can compare to the cost of long-term care as reported in Genworth (2016).
There is a wide range of nursing home costs; an annual stay in a private room in a nursing home averages
$92K and ranges between $60K to $250K, reflecting varying costs and qualities. Not all individuals who
need help with LTC move to nursing homes. Those with less severe needs may purchase formal in-home care,
which typically costs about $50K per year. Thus, the change in spending when in need of LTC predicted by
the model aligns well with the costs associated with obtaining extra care. Beyond spending on formal LTC,
there are various ways that needing help with ADLs can lead to increased spending. For example, people
may purchase more expensive prepared food if cooking is difficult, they may hire help to clean the house
and care for landscaping, they may install devices around the house to help with mobility, et cetera. The
increase in spending in our model when people are in need of help with ADLs is designed to capture costs
directly related to LTC as well as these other reasons that living with ADL impairments is expensive.23

Fig. 12.—Distribution of Expenditure. This figure plots the cross-section of expenditure for those in good health and
for those in need of help with ADLs.

Figure 13 presents the distribution of expenditure by health status conditional on age. The distribution
of expenditure for people in good health is near constant across age. The 90th percentile is around $100K
per year, while the 10th percentile is around $30K. Expenditure when in need of LTC is also fairly constant
across age, with substantially higher skewness at all ages and more variation in the upper percentiles. These
expenditure patterns are consistent with the interpretation that spending when in need of help with ADLs
is viewed as a necessary good with an additional intensive margin valuation.
Figure 14 puts this all together by plotting the share of total expenditure for each age by ADL-status.
23

Since we model spending when in need of LTC and not spending on LTC, there is no direct mapping from consumption
and medical spending in our model to health-related out-of-pocket expenditures in surveys like the HRS or Medicare Current
Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), which limits our ability to compare model predictions to data. Future advances in measuring total
consumption and expenditure with large samples in the appropriate age range would help, but current consumption data in the
U.S. is limited.

Fig. 13. —Distribution of Expenditure by Age. This figure plots expenditure by age for those in good health and for
those in need of help with ADLs. The blue line is median expenditure, the blue area marks the 25th-75th percentiles
and the pink area contains the 10th-90th percentiles.

This calculation combines the fraction of people with each health status and the distribution of expenditures
by health status. The most dramatic change over the life cycle is the decrease in the share of expenditure
by those in good health and the increase in the share associated with those needing help with ADLs at
older ages. At younger ages, very few people need help with ADLs, and it is not until around age 80 when
those people account for over 10 percent of total expenditure. After age 80, however, the expenditure share
associated with those needing LTC increases rapidly. The probability of needing care increases at these ages
and the expenditure by those needing care is significantly higher than those in good health. At age 90 those
needing help with ADLs account for about one third of expenditures. This suggests that risks and associated
preferences combine to make LTC a significant driver of saving for the elderly. Taken together, these figures
show that the estimated model predicts reasonable expenditure patterns in the cross-section and over the
life cycle, at the individual and population levels.

Note.—This table presents percentiles of the bequest distribution in thousands of dollars under different
parameterizations of health-state dependent and bequest utility functions.
Finally, to document the relative strength of the different saving motives, we present in Table 4 percentiles
of the distribution of bequests under alternative parameter values. Bequests are one useful variable to
describe saving over the life cycle, since they are the result of a life time of asset accumulation. Similar
patterns are present in other measures of life cycle saving, e.g., maximum wealth. The differences presented
in Table 4 reflect the relative strength of the LTC and bequest utility functions estimated with the wealth
and SSQ data using the full model, as opposed to the synthetic static choice problems featured earlier. The
first row shows bequests under the baseline parameterization, the second row shows bequests when there
is zero utility from leaving a bequest (θbeq = ∞), the third row shows bequests when utility when in need
of help with ADLs is equal to utility when healthy (θADL = 1, κADL = 0 ) , and the fourth row combines
these alternatives by showing bequests when there is no bequest utility and no health-state dependent utility
(θbeq = ∞, θADL = 1, κADL = 0 ).
Comparing these parameterizations provides insight on the contribution of the various saving motives
to overall late-in-life wealth accumulation. In the baseline model, realized bequests reflect an active desire
to leave a bequest and an incidental bequest driven by precautionary saving combined with mortality risk.
These motives interact to reinforce each other: with strong bequest motives, the cost of ex-post oversaving
for the ADL health state is lower and strong ADL-state utility induces high saving rates that may result in
a large incidental bequest. Because of this interaction this exercise does not provide a strict decomposition.
Nonetheless, the magnitude of the differences are informative of the strength of the motives. These interdependencies highlight the benefit of SSQs that can help to separately identify preferences in light of these
interactions.
When shutting off the bequest motive, the average bequest is two-thirds its baseline level, suggesting
that the majority of saving over the life cycle is driven by precautionary motives related to health and death
and that most bequests are incidental as opposed to being driven by an active warm-glow bequest margin.
Furthermore, average bequests are larger in the model with no bequest motive than in the model with no
health-state dependent utility. In the cases with zero bequest utility, bequests are on average 43 percent
larger with the LTC utility function than without. On average, the model without either the bequest motive
or the LTC utility function generates just under half of the baseline bequest, indicating that longevity risk is
a significant contributor to realized bequests, but not the whole story quantitatively. There are also different
responses to the alternative parameterizations across the bequest distribution. The median bequest is lower
in the case in which there is no bequest utility compared to when there is no health-state dependent utility,
while the 75th and 90th percentiles of the bequest distribution are larger. This pattern arises because the
34

means-tested public care option dissuades lower-wealth individuals from saving for LTC reasons and because
health-state utility encourages rapid dissaving when in need of care towards the end of life that is subject
to diminishing within-period returns. Overall, Table 4 shows that both precautionary motives and bequests
contribute substantially to wealth accumulation over the life cycle and that health-state dependent utility
related to long-term care needs is a quantitatively significant determinant of saving patterns at older ages.

7.3

Fit of Non-Targeted Wealth Moments

To demonstrate the saving behavior across the wealth distribution implied by the baseline estimates, Figure
15 plots the model fit to non-targeted wealth moments. Even though the 10th percentile was not targeted
in the estimation, the model fit to data is almost exact. Preference parameters estimated by targeting the
higher wealth moments successfully replicate savings patterns of the less affluent. The model does a good
job of “out of sample” prediction for low levels of wealth, which corresponds to a large fraction of the U.S.
population who may be the target of policy changes and innovations to promote retirement saving. The
use of SSQs permits predictions over households who do not—because of their level of financial resources
or institutional and market constraints—face the same economic trade-offs as members of the VRI sample.
We explore this further by analyzing model predictions for the HRS sample in Section 9.2. In contrast,
the model predicts less wealth than appears in the data at the 90th percentile, typically underpredicting
wealth by around 10 to 15 percent. Our interpretation is that the model is missing certain features that are
particularly important for the wealthiest members of the VRI sample, which itself oversamples high wealth
individuals relative to the U.S. population.

Comparison to Alternative Parameter Estimates

8.1

Matching only SSQ or only Wealth Moments

In our baseline estimation, we jointly target the wealth moments that are traditionally used in this literature
and our newly-created SSQ moments. In order to disentangle the relative contribution of the SSQs in the
estimation results, in this section we present and analyze the estimated preferences that result from matching
wealth moments or SSQ moments exclusively. We are able to use the SSQ moments exclusively because
we have collected sufficient non-behavioral data to identify the preference parameters solely from the SSQ
responses. Although our preferred estimates use both wealth and SSQ data, we do not need to augment the
non-behavioral data with observed behaviors to gain identification. We are unaware of any existing study
that has undertaken a similar estimation of a structural life cycle model without requiring behavioral data for
parameter identification. The SSQ data serves two roles: First, they corroborate the importance of LTC that
the wealth data alone suggests. Second they substantially improve the precision of the preference parameter
estimates, reducing standard errors to levels that permit concrete, instead of suggestive, conclusions.
Although it is difficult to compare across estimates that target different moments, some broad messages
are clear. Every set of estimates suggests that the marginal utility of expenditures when in need of LTC is
larger than that from bequests for all relevant wealth levels. κADL is always estimated to be negative and
large in magnitude. Often θADL is smaller than θbeq , and in the SSQ-moment case when they are almost
equal, the large negative κADL dominates the positive and small κbeq . Thus, it is not just because we target
SSQs that we find the importance of the precautionary saving motive induced by LTC risk. Hence, many
features of the data strongly support allowing for a non-homothetic LTC health-state utility function, that
spending when in need of LTC is viewed as a necessity and it is highly valued on the margin. Moreover,
direct analysis of the distribution of SSQs responses imply that the preference for leaving a bequest is not
as strong as the wealth data alone suggests.

First, consider targeting only the wealth moments. Figure 16a presents the model-generated and empirical 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile of the wealth distribution across ages. The
model-generated data matches the cross-sectional wealth distribution well for most ages. As displayed in
Figure 16b, the parameters that best match the wealth moments generate SSQ moments that are somewhat
distant from those measured in the data. Roughly speaking, the resulting parameters suggest individuals
that are more risk averse and have stronger desires to spend when in need of LTC and to leave bequests
than the SSQ data imply.
Now consider targeting only the SSQ moments. As can be seen in Figures 17a and 17b, the SSQ moments
are hit almost exactly. The success in fitting these moments should not be surprising, given that SSQs were
designed to ensure identification, though the SSQ responses were not guaranteed to be mutually consistent.
When targeting only the SSQ moments, the fit to the wealth moments deteriorates, with the model predicting
undersaving for the 75th percentile and over saving for the 50th and, especially, the 25th percentile.

A model’s ability to match wealth moments does not necessarily mean that preferences and all associated
saving motives are well identified. Including SSQ moments introduces more information on saving motives
and disciplines the channels through which a model can match wealth moments. The tension in matching
both sets of moments simultaneously highlights the need for further model development. We have started
here by introducing the non-homothetic health-state utility function. The information contained in the SSQs
provides a source of identification for even richer models.

Due to the non-linearity of the model, the joint estimates are neither a convex combination nor contained
within the interval of the wealth-only or SSQ-only estimates.
Compared to baseline, when matching the SSQ moments alone the estimation procedure delivers a
lower γ and higher θADL and θbeq . The estimates targeting wealth moments only result in a higher risk
aversion coefficient and a higher marginal utility when in need of long-term care, generated by both lower

θADL and more negative κADL . In the wealth estimation we find that most parameters are estimated
with very large standard errors, which reflects the fundamental difficulty in identifying richer preference
parameters from wealth data alone. This difficulty was discussed extensively in Ameriks, Caplin, Laufer,
and Van Nieuwerburgh (2011), and commented on by De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) in discussion of
their Table 2. Additionally, because we only have a cross-section, we cannot control for cohort effects. The
use of SSQs allows us to design questions that overcome this limitation.
Comparing Parameters Estimated to Match Alternative Moments. It is difficult to compare the
economic interpretation of estimated parameters in isolation because the value of γ affects the interpretation
of the θ and κ parameters, just as the value of κADL affects the interpretation of the value of θADL . To
compare across sets of parameters we return to the simple synthetic static choice problem presented in
equation 11.
Figures 18a, 18b, and 18c plot the resulting optimal allocations for the parameter sets that result from
targeting different moments. Across all estimates, LTC expenditure is allocated the majority of wealth.
In comparing across the specifications, several patterns are observable that reflect differences in parameter
estimates. We observe that the estimates that exclusively target wealth moments indicate that bequests
are more of a luxury good, and thus receive a lower share of allocated wealth. In addition, these wealth
estimates indicate a very high marginal value of wealth when in the LTC state, which is reflected in panel
18b by the slow decline in LTC expenditure as wealth increases. The SSQ estimates indicate high θADL and
θbeq . The SSQ estimates imply a low marginal value of wealth in these states, and is reflected by the steeper
allocation profile of normal consumption in panel 18c. Finally, note that the lines in panel 18a generally
fall between the corresponding lines in the other two panels. Although this does not hold at lower levels

of wealth exactly, this broad pattern reflects the trade-off between matching the two sets of moments in
the joint estimation. In sum, the SSQ-only, wealth-only, and baseline estimation all result in estimates that
indicate a strong desire to spend when in need of help with activities of daily living.

Comparison of Preferences Across the Literature

Different preference parameters can induce radically different saving and spending behavior. To demonstrate
the degree of difference and to illustrate the large impact of these differences on implied saving behavior, we
contrast the implications of the estimated baseline parameters with those in the literature.

Fig. 19.—Expenditure Levels Across Studies.

In Figures 19a and 19b we compare the relative strength of these motives induced by the parameters we
have estimated to those estimated in De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) (DFJ) and Lockwood (2018), as
these are some of the most closely related papers to ours. We translate the parameters from other papers
to be compatible with our utility function specification, yielding DFJ parameters of γ = 3.81, θADL = 0.79,
κADL = 0, θbeq = 2360, and κbeq = 273 and Lockwood parameters of γ = 3, θADL = 1, κADL = 0,
θbeq = 1460, and κbeq = 231. In a similar analysis to that presented in Figure 18, in Figure 19a we present

39

the optimal bequest allocation (z2 ) from the following optimization problem when calibrated according to
each paper’s baseline estimate of risk aversion and bequest parameters:
max
z1 ,z2

(θbeq )γ (z2 + κbeq )1−γ
(z1 )1−γ
+
1−γ
1−γ

(12)

s.t. z1 + z2 ≤ W
z1 , z2 ≥ 0; z2 ≥ −κbeq .
We observe that relative to these other studies, in this paper the preference for leaving a bequest is
estimated to be somewhat stronger at low levels of wealth, but much weaker at high wealth levels. Whereas
these studies’ estimates suggest a steadily increasing allocation to bequests even for wealth levels above
$400,000, our estimates suggest the allocation share is relatively stable for wealth levels above $100,000.
Thus, in our estimation bequests are considered less of a luxury good compared to both DFJ and Lockwood.
Furthermore, for high levels of wealth, the bequest share asymptotes to 48% in our baseline, compared
to 89% for DFJ and 92% for Lockwood. These differences reflect that we estimate a much lower bequest
multiplier and hence a lower marginal value of bequests at high wealth levels than either other study. These
differences are illustrated just in the simple synthetic allocation problem, but it helps to demonstrate why
in our model most of bequeathed wealth is given incidentally rather than as a result of a bequest motive per
se.
DFJ show that health risks play an important role in determining late-in-life savings patterns, while
Lockwood shows that highly valued bequests can explain much of late-in-life wealth holdings. This difference
between the two studies in the preference for leaving a bequest can be large at the lower wealth levels featured
in their samples. At higher wealth levels these differences shrink, documenting the value of the higher-wealth
VRI sample in identifying bequest motives. Indeed, DFJ are well aware of this, writing “Our sample of singles
may not contain enough rich households to reveal strong bequest motives.” We can extend DFJ’s claims
that “most people in [their] sample do not have strong bequest motives” by documenting that a sample with
higher wealth individuals yields a similar lack of individuals with a strong preference to leave a large bequest.
One reason we estimate weaker bequest motives is that our modeling of non-homothetic utility in the
ADL health state reduces the need for a strong bequest motive to match saving patterns for middle-wealth
individuals. In Figure 19b we present the z2 allocation for the problem presented in equation 12, with
the bequest function replaced by the LTC state utility function. Lockwood does not have state dependent
utility in the baseline model, and hence would suggest an equal allocation across states. DFJ do allow for a
differential marginal utility multiplier when unhealthy, but no marginal utility additive shifter. (Additionally,
DFJ allow for health-state dependent utility when an individual is sick, but do not model the LTC state
separately.) The estimated state dependent utility parameter in DFJ is insignificant and assigns almost
equal marginal utility to both states, resulting in an almost equal allocation. In this paper, we estimate
LTC expenditure to be valued strongly as a necessity, resulting in a much higher allocation to the LTC state
expenditure, not only at low levels of wealth, but also at higher wealth levels. Furthermore, estimation of a
negative κADL has the attractive feature that, eventually, the extra spending when in need of LTC driven
by this motive diminishes with wealth.

40

Analyzing the Behavioral Implications of Parameters from the Literature. We have documented
substantial differences in the preferences estimated in the literature and that these differences induce very
different savings patterns and imply different motives determining saving behavior. Using both new wealth
data on high wealth individuals and new SSQ measurements, we have estimated preferences that imply that
savings are driven to a significant degree by health related precautionary saving motives.

Fig. 20. Model Fit to Wealth Moments for Alternative Parameters.

Figure 20 compares moments of the population wealth profiles induced by these model parameters to
those in the data. In addition to Lockwood and DFJ parameter values, we include a set of parameters
designed to capture the classic setup similar to that in Yaari (1965) in which there is no health-state
dependent utility function, zero bequest utility, no government provided care, and no minimum expenditure
when in need of LTC (γ = 3, θADL = 1, κADL = 0, θbeq = 0, κbeq ≈ ∞, ψG = 0, ωG = 0, and χ = 0). Since
our baseline parameters were in part chosen to match these wealth targets, it is no surprise that they do
so well, as discussed previously. In terms of induced savings profiles, our estimated parameters look most
similar to those of Lockwood, with DFJ and especially Yaari (1965) preferences leading to less saving over
the life cycle than is observed in the data.24 These differences show that the wealth data can be used to
help distinguish across preference parameters, however, it is in the SSQ moments that the different implied
motives really stand out.
Figure 21 compares parameter-implied and empirical SSQ means across parameter sets. The results
are striking, particularly for questions 3a, 3b, and 3c, which ask respondents to make a trade-off between
spending on themselves when in need of LTC and leaving a bequest. The parameters estimated by Lockwood
and DFJ generate data that match SSQs 1 and 2 well, but do not match SSQ 3, as they imply a much too
high propensity to allocate towards bequests given their estimated θbeq and κbeq . In contrast, since the Yaari
parameters place zero value on bequests, they overshoot and would predict much too small of an allocation
24

Many papers in the literature, including DFJ, have estimates that are derived from less affluent samples. Thus, it is not
surprising that the estimated parameters do not match moments for the high wealth individuals in the VRI.

towards bequests compared to the data. Together, Figures 20 and 21 show that models can be consistent
with the preference information provided by SSQs without sacrificing fit with the empirical wealth-age
distribution. Furthermore, SSQ methods can be used as a powerful parameter identification device.
Given that these parameters represent significantly different preferences and induce very different saving
behavior in different contingencies, SSQs provide extra information that helps to identify these parameter
values. Modeling a non-homothetic LTC-state dependent utility function allows us to match wealth moments
across the wealth and age distribution as well as traditional models, while also being consistent with survey
evidence on stated preferences.

Additional Analyses
Sensitivity Analysis

In this section we provide additional analysis which demonstrates the robustness of the main conclusion
that long-term-care related utility and risks are a significant driver of late-in-life saving behavior. To show
this we perform sensitivity analysis by re-estimating the model under the following alternative assumptions:
(i) we vary the CRRA parameter (γ); (ii) we vary the time discount factor (β); (iii) we allow for different
curvature exponents in the utility functions for bequests and when alive; (iv) we allow for a more severe
definition of needing help with ADLs; (v) we eliminate and double out-of-pocket medical expenses; and (vi)
we add housing wealth to financial wealth and match the model to this measure of total wealth.

Table 6 reports the alternative parameter estimates associated with each sensitivity analysis exercise. In
addition, to provide a sense of the behavior that would be induced by the alternative parameters, the table
reports expenditure shares associated with the synthetic static allocation problem presented in equation 11.
The striking feature across all exercises is the large and negative κADL coupled with θADL < 1, which drives
a large allocation to ADL expenditure.
Different γ. Table 6 presents estimates of all other parameters when setting γ = 2 or γ = 8, in contrast
to the baseline estimate of γ = 5.27. When risk aversion is higher, not much changes. With a smaller
coefficient of relative risk aversion, there is slightly more need for a stronger bequest utility to match the
same wealth data. This appears in the large decrease in θbeq , since κbeq actually increases. This change in
preferences nearly doubles bequests in the synthetic allocation problem. Nonetheless, for this wide range of
γ, LTC remains by far the dominant expenditure in the simple static allocation problem.
Different β. A higher β, reflecting more patient individuals, is associated with minor reductions in ADL
expenditure and slight increases in bequests. The CRRA parameter estimate is lower than in the baseline,

43

as increased patience helps match the wealth data with a somewhat weaker precautionary motive. Although
there are some changes in bequest and ADL parameters, associated synthetic expenditure shares do not
move much. In total, changes in the discount factor between the baseline β = 0.97 and β = 0.999 do not
much affect the estimated parameters or the main conclusion that LTC related preferences and risks are a
significant driver of savings over the life cycle.
Bequest Utility Exponent. In this exercise, we allow for a bequest-specific exponent in the utility
function. That is, different from γ, we allow for γbeq such that: ν(b) =

−γbeq
1−γbeq
(b+κbeq )

(θbeq )

1−γbeq

.

Since the parameter is not precisely-estimated using wealth data alone and we do not have a strategic
survey question to separately identify a bequest curvature parameter, we explore γbeq = 2 and γbeq = 8.
We choose one value below and one above the ordinary CRRA parameter γ to explore whether the LTCrelated saving motive remains strong with a more flexible parameterization. In particular, the lower γbeq
makes the bequest utility function less concave and provides more potential for a large bequest motive.
Ceteris paribus, these changes represent significant differences in the marginal utility of a bequest relative to
baseline. Nonetheless, when reestimating the model most parameters are little affected; the ordinary CRRA
parameter γ changes the most from baseline. Aside from the estimate of γ, qualitatively and quantitatively
the other parameter estimates remain similar to baseline. When γbeq = 2, the bequest motive generates
more saving and the model can match the same wealth moments with less precautionary savings, resulting
in a lower estimate of γ = 3.01. At γbeq = 8, the precautionary saving motive needs to be stronger to match
the wealth moments, resulting in a larger than baseline γ = 7.56. Expenditure when in need of LTC is still
viewed as a strong necessary good with substantial marginal valuation, indicated by a large and negative
κADL and θADL < 1.
At lower levels of expenditure, e.g., W = $100K, the synthetic expenditure shares on ADL and bequests
remain close to those resulting from the baseline parameters. At higher expenditure levels, e.g. $200K, when
γbeq = 2, the synthetic expenditure share on bequests is larger than in the baseline. Both when γbeq equals
2 or 8, bequests are estimated as more of a luxury good (larger κbeq ). The higher γbeq = 8 represents a more
concave bequest function, which combines with the higher κbeq and similar θbeq to generate less bequests.
When the utility function is less concave, at higher wealth levels the lower γbeq = 2 more than offsets the
higher κbeq to generate an increased desire to leave a bequest.
In sum, whether the bequest function is more or less concave than in the baseline, whenever an individual
needs help with LTC, long-term-care utility is always estimated to represent a strong necessary desire to
spend with a high marginal valuation.
Definition of ADL State. When mapping the model to the data, we defined s = 2 as meaning “needs
and is receiving help with at least one activity of daily living.” In this exercise, we change the definition
of ADLs to only capture people who are in need of help with multiple ADLs. First we classify s = 2 if an
individual needs and receives help with at least two ADLs, and then with at least three ADLs. This has
three effects that partially offset each other. First, the ADL state is more severe, with higher persistence
in the ADL state which increases the precautionary saving motive all other things equal. Second, the more
severe ADL state is associated with lower survival rates, reducing expected longevity. Third, individuals
are less likely to enter the ADL health state, reducing precautionary saving for any individual and reducing

44

the fraction of people dissaving rapidly in the ADL state. Because of these offsetting effects the different
estimated health state transition probabilities leave the estimated preference parameters largely unchanged.
Different Health Expenditure Risk.

Given the difficulty of accurately measuring health expenditure

costs and of separating exogenous from endogenous expenditures in the HRS, we explore the effect of large
changes in the health-expenditure distribution on parameter estimates. We set all medical expenditure shocks
to zero and also doubled all expenditure shocks. In both cases, estimates are substantively unchanged. While
these expenses are likely to be more important for the U.S. population, they play a smaller role for people
represented by the VRI sample.
Housing Wealth and Transaction Costs. In the baseline model, we map the wealth variable a to total
financial wealth in the data. We do this because housing is a complicated asset that is in some ways like
financial wealth and in some ways more like a durable consumption good. Housing is like financial wealth
in that it can be sold and transformed into liquid wealth, albeit in a market subject to frictions. Housing is
unlike financial wealth in that it is a physical good that delivers housing services. In this exercise, we map
a to the sum of housing and financial wealth. In addition to using the full value of the house, to account for
costs associated with the sale of a house, we also do this by subtracting 15 percent of the house price. Either
way, this results in only modest changes in the estimated parameters and associated expenditure shares.

9.2

External Validity using HRS Data

Our final exercise is to use the estimated baseline parameters to compare savings patterns in the data and the
model using the U.S. representative HRS population. In this section we provide a summary of this analysis,
with details provided in the Online Appendix. First, we estimate health transitions, survival probabilities,
health costs, and income profiles using the HRS sample, as opposed to the VRI-eligible HRS subsample.
Then we sample single households from the HRS and record age, health status, and permanent income
quintile in the year in which they enter the HRS. We generate a sequence of health transitions and cost
shocks for each household and simulate their saving and expenditure patterns using the optimal policies
associated with our estimated baseline model. Finally, we compare percentiles of the simulated wealth
distribution with those measured by the HRS in the subsequent waves. When possible, we do this analysis
separately for each cohort, given the different sampling procedures and aggregate environment associated
with each cohort.
Overall, our model with our baseline parameter estimates performs well in the HRS sample and matches
the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the wealth distribution for the cohorts that we consider with a few
notable exceptions. For the War Babies and Early Baby Boomers cohorts, our model matches closely the
wealth distribution by age. The notable exception is that the model overpredicts wealth in the 2010 wave,
possibly because we do not model the financial crisis. When using the Asset and Health Dynamics of the
Oldest Old (AHEAD) sample, the model again matches the data well, although it slightly overpredicts the
spend down of wealth in the median wealth percentile later in life. This analysis shows that even though our
model is estimated using data from the VRI that is not representative of the U.S. population, our estimated
preferences and assumptions about incomplete markets result in a model that is informative about the
motives for saving in the more general U.S. population.

Conclusion

Individuals face multiple risks and have multiple objectives late in life. The risks include longevity, health,
and the need for care. The objectives include sustaining consumption in potentially different health states
and providing a bequest. With the decline of defined benefit pensions, with increased longevity, with high and
variable cost of care, and absent or highly-imperfect insurance markets for late-in-life risks, older households
are increasingly responsible for managing financial assets late in life to address these multiple objectives
across states of the world.
In this paper, we present novel preference elicitation methods and data to answer questions about latein-life saving and spending. The modeling, measurement, and data were designed in tandem:
• We build an incomplete markets model of individuals, who save precautionarily when faced with health
risks, the potential need for long-term care, and an uncertain life span, and who value consuming,
leaving a bequest, and receiving long-term care if they need it. Expenditures when in need of long-term
care can be valued differently than ordinary consumption, depending on estimates of a non-homothetic
health-state dependent utility function, and individuals choose on the margin the amount to spend
when in need of LTC.
• We develop strategic survey questions (SSQs) that use a novel application of stated-preference methodology. These SSQs are designed to elicit responses that identify the preference parameters of the model.
• We develop a novel data infrastructure—the Vanguard Research Initiative—that combines information
on income, assets, and demographics with the SSQs responses on a large sample of older Americans
with sufficient financial assets to make operational the financial tradeoffs implied by the model.
We estimate the parameters of the model using moments from the wealth distribution alone, SSQs alone,
and both wealth and SSQs. The point estimates based on the traditional approach of using the wealth
distribution and the novel approach of using the SSQs are generally similar. The estimates with the wealth
data alone are, however, imprecise. Because multiple motives generate wealth accumulation and wealth is
fungible across outcomes, wealth data alone do not strongly identify motives. In contrast, the SSQs provide
relatively sharp identification of relevant parameters. This precise identification of parameters allows us to
make inferences that are difficult to support with behavioral data alone.
The findings in the paper point toward the risk of needing LTC when old as a substantial motive for
accumulating assets. The marginal utility of expenditures when in need of LTC is larger than that from
bequests. Due to the strength of the estimated health-state dependent utility function, the precautionary
saving motives associated with LTC contribute significantly to late-in-life saving behavior, strongly affecting
wealth accumulation—tending to increase savings both across the wealth distribution and over the life
cycle—for a large fraction of the U.S. population. For a typical wealthholder in our sample, peak assets in
retirement are about twice what they would be absent a difference between utility of spending in the healthy
versus need-for-care state. Health-state-dependent utility also helps explain the post-retirement pattern of
assets. It is a motive for continued asset accumulation in retirement. LTC associated expenses also lead to
a rapid drawdown of assets late in life and therefore generate lower bequests on average than the continued
buildup of assets would otherwise suggest.

46

Finally, the model and SSQ-based estimates help distinguish the motives for leaving bequests—something
difficult to do with the behavioral data alone because many bequests will be incidental, that is, occur in
the event where an earlier than expected death or less-costly than expected old age result in a larger than
expected bequest. Bequests in the baseline model resulting from longevity risk, precautionary saving for
LTC risk, and a warm-glow bequest motive are on average more than twice the incidental bequest owing
to longevity uncertainty alone. Overall, we show that the desire to self-insure against long-term-care risk
explains a substantial fraction of the wealthholding of older Americans.

Fig. A.1.—Income Profile Quintiles.

We estimate a deterministic income process from the cross-sectional income distribution. Income is defined
as the sum of labor income, publicly and privately provided pensions, and disability income, as measured
in VRI Survey 1. The income processes are estimated to be a function of a constant, age, age squared, sex,
and the interaction of sex and age. To ensure that income is positive in all periods, we estimate a quantile
regression of log income on these variables. Because we allow for 5 income profiles, the quantile regression
is estimated for the 10th , 30th , 50th , 70th , and 90th percentiles of the income distribution. We calibrate our
income processes to the resulting estimates and group individuals into income profile quintiles.

A.2

Health

Health-State Transition Matrix. Using appropriate health state definitions we estimate a sequence of
health transition matrices conditional on a vector xi,t which includes individual i’s age, t, and sex, g. The
HRS only records 2 year health state transitions which we use to identify the one-year transition probabilities
47

in a manner similar to De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010). To do this, we write the two year transition
probabilities as:
P r(st+2 = j|st = i) =

3
X

P r(st+2 = j|st+1 = k)P r(st+1 = k|st = i) =

k=0

3
X

πkj,t+1 πik,t

k=0

where,
πik,t = P3

φik,t

m=0 φim,t

and φik,t = exp(xi,t βk ).

We then estimate βk using a maximum likelihood estimator, and use these estimates to construct the
corresponding cells in the health transition matrices. Health transitions are estimated using HRS waves
2 through 10. The questions necessary to make the health state assignment are not available in the 1992
survey, so we exclude this wave from the health transition estimates.
Figures A.2 and A.3 display the estimated health state transition probabilities (πg (s0 |t, s)). Section 5.1.2
describes the estimation methodology. An additional consideration is how to define the “needs long term
care” health status. There are 3 measures in the HRS that could potentially be used. The first is nursing
home stay, the second is needs help with the activities of daily living, and the third is receives help with the
activities of daily living.
Nursing home stay (more than 120 nights in a nursing home before the current interview or currently in
a nursing home at time of interview) is what De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) used. Given that we allow
people in the model to choose their type of care, we want a less restrictive definition for s = 2. The ADL
questions in the RAND version of the HRS list many activities of daily living and asks if the respondent has
difficulty completing those tasks without help. In some sense, these questions provide the broadest possible
definition of the ADL state, since many people could report having difficulty, but would still be able to live
without receiving help. We choose to implement the intermediate measure: we categorize and individual
as needing help with LTC if they have difficulty with at least one ADL and they also receive outside help
completing the ADL task. Since we are not using stays in a nursing home to represent our health state
s = 2, not modeling spending when in need of care as an out-of-pocket expenditure shock, and not using a
U.S. representative sample, our model-generated health and spending patterns will be different from those
in Hurd, Michaud, and Rohwedder (2017) and Friedberg, Hou, Sun, Webb, and Li (2014).
Health Cost. To estimate the mean of the health cost distribution, µ(t, g, s), we run an OLS regression
of annualized log out-of-pocket medical expenditures (variable r10oopmd in the RAND HRS) on age, sex,
health state, and interaction terms. Log medical expenses are modeled as a linear function of a quartic in
age, prior health status, sex, and health interacted with age. Using the residuals from this first regression,
we regress the squared residuals on the same set of state variables as in the first regression to find the
conditional variance of medical expenses, σ 2 (t, g, s). The resulting mean and variance estimates parameterize
the lognormal distribution for medical expenses conditional on age, sex and health status. We then discretize
the error term using the Tauchen method to generate the medical expense process.

Fig. A.4.—Median Health Cost Profile.

Figure A.4 plots the median health cost shock over the life cycle by men and women of different health
status. Men in poor health spend around $100 more per year for health costs than healthy men. Later in
life, men in need of LTC spend about $600 more than healthy men. Saving is also affected by the risk of
high costs, so in Table A.1 we present examples of the health cost distribution across sex, age, and health
states. Overall, these health costs are much smaller than LTC expenditures and thus contribute little to
the overall savings motive. The ideal health cost measure would involve some fine-tuning, e.g., removing
some mandatory component of nursing home costs and adding end of life expenses. Since in our sensitivity
analysis we see little effect of setting these costs to zero or doubling these costs, we do not dive more deeply
into health cost spending subcategories. See French, Jones, and McCauley (2017) for detailed analysis of
health-related spending in the HRS and MCBS. Since we model spending when in need of LTC, instead of
spending on LTC, there is no direct mapping from output in our model to health-spending in these surveys.
