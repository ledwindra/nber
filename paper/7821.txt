Introduction
Few important issues in corporate or public finance have remained unsettled for as long

as the related questions of how corporations finance their new investment projects and how taxes
affect their investment decisions. The initial focus in the corporate finance literature, dating
from Modigliani and Miller (1958), was on the tax advantage to debt under the classical
corporate tax system that permits deductions for interest but not dividends. Subsequent
contributions emphasized the apparent tax advantage of retained earnings over new share issues
as a source of equity funds, tracing this advantage to the reduction in shareholder dividend taxes
that retentions, but not new share issues, induce under the classical system. Indeed, under the
“new view” of dividend taxation developed in Auerbach (1979), Bradford (1981) and King
(1977), this tax advantage of retentions precisely offsets the double taxation of subsequent
dividends: taxes on dividends have no impact on the investment incentives of firms using
retentions as a marginal source of funds and paying dividends with residual cash flows.
The difference between this result and that of the more “traditional” view, that dividend
taxation imposes an additional tax wedge on corporate investment, bears on evaluations of
changes in the tax treatment of dividends. Analyses of corporate tax integration proposals (e.g.
U.S. Treasury 1992, American Law Institute Reporter’s Study 1993) routinely accord a central
place to the debate over which “view” of dividend taxation is more accurate, because integration
promises far less significant efficiency gains (or larger efficiency losses) and larger windfalls to
shareholders if dividend taxes impose little or no marginal tax burden to begin with and are
simply capitalized into corporate share values.
Over the years, researchers have developed a variety of methods to determine the impact
of dividend taxation on corporate investment. Some have argued that their findings reject the

new view. As we will discuss below, however, this evidence is inconclusive, based either on
excessively restrictive representations of the “new” view or on questionable collateral
assumptions. Indeed, perhaps the most surprising aspect of the continuing debate is that the most
crucial prediction of the new view – that firms obtain their equity funds for investment through
the retention of earnings, and distribute residual funds as dividends – has not been evaluated
directly. In seeking to remedy this omission from the literature, we find evidence that dividends
do respond to investment and cash flow for the nonfinancial corporate sector as a whole. We
also find that this dividend pattern is weaker for firms with better access to capital markets, as
measured by bond rating and the number of analysts following them. Finally, we find that,
although new share issues and repurchases respond to the same firm characteristics as dividends
do, the pattern of these responses is consistent with a broader interpretation of the new view that
preserves the main result of dividend-tax irrelevance with respect to the cost of capital.
While these findings are the paper’s central contribution, it is useful to place them in the
context of the prior literature, to explain why they are consistent with past research that has
purported to reject the new view for the corporate sector as a whole. Toward this end, the next
section reviews the “new” and “traditional” views of dividend taxation, and Section III surveys
the existing tests of the two views and explains why the evidence is inconclusive. Section IV
presents a model of dividend behavior to motivate our empirical tests. Section V discusses data
sources, Sections VI and VII present our main estimation results, and section VIII offers a brief
look at time series behavior. The final section offers some brief conclusions.

II.

Measuring the Impact of Dividend Taxation
Alternative views of the impact of dividend taxation rely on different assumptions about

the sources and uses of equity funds (see Auerbach 1983, 2000 for further elaboration). A
2

standard result, that dividend taxes affect the firm’s cost of capital, occurs in a model
characterized by Poterba and Summers (1985) as the “traditional” view. In the model they
describe, firms obtain equity funds to finance investment by issuing new shares, and distribute a
fixed fraction of the earnings generated by this investment as dividends, retaining the rest for
reinvestment. The retained funds increase the value of the firm dollar for dollar, because they
substitute for the marginal equity funds being obtained in that period through additional new
share issues. Thus, each dollar of equity funds contributed to the firm has a value to the
shareholder one period later equal to 1+ r(1-τ)[p(1-θ)+(1-p)(1-c)], where r is the before-tax rate
of return, τ is the corporate tax rate, p is the dividend payout rate, θ is the tax rate on dividends,
and c is the accrual-equivalent tax rate on the capital gains induced by retentions. The return
depends on the corporate tax rate and the weighted average of the dividend and capital gains tax
rates, where the weights are determined by the dividend payout rate.
Under the new view, marginal equity funds come through retained earnings, so that the
opportunity cost to the shareholder of a dollar of new investment is reduced by the dividend
taxes foregone, net of the increased tax burden on the capital gains induced by the accrual.
Because the value of new investment per dollar equals its cost to the shareholder, in equilibrium,
the cost of retaining a dollar is qN = 1-θ+cqN , or qN = (1-θ)/(1-c). One period later, this
investment plus its return is worth qN[1+r(1-τ)(1-c)]/qN , per initial net dollar foregone, if all
earnings are retained. If all earnings in the subsequent period are paid out, then the shareholder
receives a payment of [1+r(1-τ)(1-c)]. This payment forces the shareholder to pay
θ [1+r(1-τ)(1-c)] in dividend taxes, which will be partially offset by the capital gains tax avoided
through the payment of the dividend, [1+r(1-τ)(1-c)]cqN. On net, the benefit of the entire
transaction is: [1+r(1-τ)(1-c)](1-θ+cqN)/qN. In either case, as long as tax rates are constant over
3

time, the value per initial dollar invested is [1+r(1-τ)(1-c)]. Thus, the dividend tax rate plays a
role in valuing the firm, but does not influence its investment.
The relevance of the new view should, in principle, be resolvable simply by observing the
form of finance firms appear to be using. The category “issuing new shares” is somewhat
arbitrary, because many firms issue small amounts of shares for such purposes as executive
compensation. As this type of behavior is not what we are interested in, we use a cutoff of a 2
percent increase in shares to define new issue activity. Based on this definition, Figure 1
displays the fraction of Compustat firms, unweighted and weighted by equity value, that issued
new common stock over the period 1981-1998. (The third series in the figure provides the
comparable weighted share for the “mature” dividend-paying company sub-sample that we
consider for much of our analysis below.)
Figure 1 suggests several useful observations. First, while most firms do not reach even
our low new-issues threshold in a given year, a substantial proportion of them does. Second, in
general, small firms are more likely to rely on new share issues than are large firms, particularly
in later years of the sample. Finally, it seems implausible that the majority of firms are using
new share issues as a marginal source of finance, even if floatation costs induce them to issue
shares in large blocks at a time to cover a few years’ investment. Weighted by value, the fraction
of firms issuing shares equal to at least 6 percent of their existing equity base over a three-year
period is below 25 percent in recent years.
Firms that avoid new share issues still may not use reductions in dividends as a source of
equity funds and increases in dividends as a residual use of funds. A maintained assumption of
original statements of the new view was that firms at these margins also don’t utilize share
repurchases, a tax-favored alternative to the payment of dividends because of the favorable tax

4

treatment (lower rate and deduction of basis) of capital gains. But share repurchases have always
been present to some extent. Indeed, as Figure 2 illustrates, share repurchases did grow during
the mid-1980s, in concert with the merger wave that occurred at the same time, as firms also
used cash to purchase the shares of other firms, in addition to their own. (Bagwell and Shoven
1989). This growth, particularly among large firms, led to the inference that firms finally had
“discovered” how to avoid dividend taxation.
Though some have seen the surge in repurchases as evidence against the new view of
dividend taxation, there are two difficulties with this logic. First, the incidence of repurchasing
fell considerably around the time of the 1990-91 recession. Although it has recovered in recent
years, there is no obvious upward trend for the full sample period.
Second, even if firms distribute some of their earnings through repurchases, the new view
remains basically intact. Note that what is crucial for the new view is the relative taxation of the
sources and uses of funds. For example, if firms obtain equity funds by reducing repurchases
and retaining earnings, and distribute funds by increasing repurchases and dividends in the same
proportion, then the new view is essentially intact. All that is needed is to apply a different value
of qN that reflects the fact that some distributions are taxed at rate θ and others are taxed at rate 0
(Sinn 1991).1 The same logic would apply if firms retained earnings and issued equity and to
finance investment and used the proceeds of investment to increase dividends and reduce new
share issues in the same proportion. Thus, rejection of the new view requires showing not only

1

We continue to assume that capital gains are taxed on accrual, so that the act of repurchasing incurs no
additional liability. The real-world situation is a bit more complicated because repurchases are subject to capital
gains taxation only on realization. In the extreme case in which the stock has zero basis (its value is all capital gain),
the capital gains tax applied to a reduction and subsequent increase in repurchases is a cash-flow tax, equivalent in
impact to a tax on dividends. While this result does not hold precisely for the general case, it will still be true that a
modified version of the new view holds, in which the tax on capital gains has some marginal impact on the return to
investment (Scholes and Wolfson 1990).

that dividends are an unimportant marginal source of funds, but also that reducing the issuance of
new shares is an unimportant marginal use of funds.2

III.

Prior Evidence on the Impact of Dividend Taxation
Researchers have attempted to evaluate the impact of dividend taxation by testing

alternative implications regarding financial and investment behavior and market valuation. The
empirical evidence perhaps most widely cited as challenging the new view was in Poterba and
Summers (1985), who estimated equations based on the q-theory of investment. The q-theory
predicts that investment by firms facing convex adjustment costs will be positively related to the
gap between the marginal value of capital, q, proxied by the stock market value per unit of
capital, and the long-run equilibrium value of capital, q*, i.e., I = f(q-q*). Under their
characterization of the traditional view of taxation, with marginal equity funds coming through
new share issues, q* = qT = 1. Under the new view, q*= qN = (1-θ)/(1-c). Estimating investment
equations of the form I = f(αqT + (1-α)qN) using postwar data from the United Kingdom, they
accepted the hypothesis that α = 1, and rejected the hypothesis that α = 0 – the traditional
hypothesis did a better job explaining investment behavior.
Several factors attenuate this finding. First, the calculation of qN requires knowledge of
the effective tax rates faced by the “marginal” investor. Yet the marginal investor’s identity
depends on the nature of financial equilibrium. If, for example, a specialized “Miller
equilibrium” prevails, then the appropriate values of θ and c are not those based on a weighted
average of income, as used by Poterba and Summers, but rather those for which investors are just
2

Even under the assumption of the traditional view that the firm relies on equity issues as a source of funds but
not as a use of funds, the cost of capital may be independent of the dividend tax rate. An example is provided by
Bernheim (1991), who develops a signaling model in which the fraction of distributions taking the form of dividends
rather than repurchases responds to changes in the dividend tax rate to preserve the average tax rate on distributions.

6

indifferent between debt and equity. Even in a more realistic model, the weights should not
generally be those used in constructing standard weighted-averages.3 Given that identification in
the U.K. sample came from frequent changes in tax rules affecting dividends, errors in
measuring the change in (1-θ)/(1-c) would tend to bias the results in favor of the traditional view.
Second, the test is meaningful only if the assumptions of the q-theory itself are satisfied, among
them that firms face convex adjustment costs, capital is homogeneous and accurately measured,
and returns to scale in production are constant. There has been a continuing dispute about the
nature of adjustment costs, and even recent evidence in support of the q-theory using panel data
(Cummins, Hassett and Hubbard 1994) suggests that aggregate measures of q contain
considerable noise, and that tests based on these – such as that performed by Poterba and
Summers – would likely be sharply biased. Finally, as discussed above, the new view’s validity
does not depend on new shares being eschewed as a source of finance, but rather that the sources
of investment funds are similar to the uses of subsequent cash flows.
A second empirical finding often taken to weaken the new view is that dividend payout
ratios respond positively to the return to a before-tax dollar of dividends relative to a before-tax
dollar of capital gains, (1-θ)/(1-c). While this evidence certainly supports the argument that
taxes influence dividend policy (and therefore contradicts the so-called “tax irrelevance” view
based on the hypothetical availability of offsetting tax arbitrage strategies), it is less clearly
evidence in favor of the traditional view specifically.
The argument that this evidence is inconsistent with the new view is based on the new
view’s prediction that the level of dividend taxes has no impact on the incentive to invest or pay
dividends. However, there are two distinct reasons why an increase in dividend taxes would

3

For further discussion, see Auerbach (2000).

7

reduce distributions under the new view. First, a temporary increase in the dividend tax rate
does raise the cost of paying dividends under the new view, for it reduces the opportunity cost of
funds more than the ultimate burden on the returns to investment: an increase in the current but
not the future value of the dividend tax rate reduces qN in the denominator of the expression
given above in deriving the new view, but not the numerator.4 Indeed consistent with this logic,
Poterba and Summers (1985) find (based on an analysis of UK data) that dividends fall with a
current rise in dividend taxes and rise with an anticipated rise in dividend taxes, even when the
level of dividend tax rates is held constant.
Second, an increase in the dividend tax typically does not occur in isolation. In the
United States, for example, dividends and interest are taxed at the same rate. An increase in
dividend taxes also raises the tax rate on interest income, a change that makes corporate
investment more attractive by lowering the after-tax return on alternative investments. Thus, it
should spur more corporate investment and, under the new view, a reduction in dividends.
That the cost of paying dividends may increase with the dividend tax rate even under the
new view helps in interpreting related evidence on dividend signaling. In a study that focused on
the question of whether dividend policy is driven by tax-based signaling, Bernheim and Wantz
(1995) reasoned that if dividends are used as a signal, their information content should relate to
their cost. Hence, the increase in value in response to a unit increase in announced dividends
should be higher during periods with a higher tax penalty on dividends. Looking at the period
1978-1988, Bernheim and Wantz estimated that the information content per dollar of dividends
fell along with the tax rate on dividends in 1981 and again in 1986. While their measure of the
cost of dividends was based on the traditional view, their finding is not necessarily inconsistent
4

This is an illustration of the well-known proposition that a cash-flow tax is neutral only if the tax rate is
constant over time.

8

with the cost of paying dividends based on the new view: the relevant cost under the new view
might well have fallen over time as well. For example, anticipations of reductions in marginal
tax rates prior to 1981 and again before 1986 should have raised the opportunity cost of paying
dividends relative to the cost after rates had reached historically low values after 1986 and would
not have been expected to fall further.
Signaling models typically do not focus on the possibility that firms use retained earnings
as their marginal source of funds, perhaps because using dividends as a signal may appear to be
inconsistent with dividends being a residual, determined by the firm’s investment level. In a
world in which firms use only equity, and dividends are the only method of distributing earnings,
it would be difficult for dividends to serve both functions at the same time. However, in a more
realistic model, the apparent inconsistency can be overcome once one recognizes that these
functions may occur at different frequencies. That is, dividends may serve as a signal at
relatively low frequencies, with firms setting their dividends at levels they perceive to be
consistent with long-run earnings potential, investment opportunities and debt capacity, with
short-term fluctuations in capital needs leading to residual changes in dividends.
Clearly, dividend policy is more rigid at high frequencies than at low frequencies. Firms
pay dividends on a quarterly basis, regardless of the timing of their investment needs within a
year. On the other hand, fast-growing firms with high rates of investment relative to earnings
have lower dividend payout ratios. The new view is not really “rejected” by the fixed nature of
dividends over a period of months, because short-term borrowing can smooth out within-year
misalignments of investment and retentions at little cost.

IV.

Toward a Model of Dividend Policy
There is little disagreement about the impact of dividend taxation on new firms with

inadequate internal funds to finance investment. The more important question is whether the
vast majority of firms that pay dividends perceive the dividend tax to place a burden on new
investment. To put it another way, what is important is whether firms view new equity issues as
their marginal source of equity funds to a much greater extent than they view reductions in
equity issues as a use of funds. To motivate the empirical analysis that follows, we offer a sketch
of a model of dividend policy.
We envision an environment in which new share issues are unattractive because of their
tax disadvantages and the non-tax costs associated with information asymmetries, which cause
shares to fall in price upon the announcement of a new issues (Asquith and Mullins 1986).
While share repurchases exist as an alternative to dividends, they are not a perfect substitute.
They offer no tax advantage when done in proportion to existing holdings of stock, for such
proportional redemptions are taxed as dividends. Thus, they are an alternative to dividends only
in circumstances where they are also subject to the non-tax costs of asymmetric information –
when firms have the potential to take advantage of tendering shareholders. As suggested by
Brennan and Thakor (1990), these costs can lead to a situation in which firms use repurchases for
large distributions, when the advantages of a repurchase overcome the costs of acquiring
information about the true value of the firm. Indeed, share repurchases do follow this pattern.
For example, in 1998, firms that repurchased shares redeemed an average of 7 percent of their
outstanding equity, while firms paying dividends distributed an average of 2 percent of equity
value.

10

If firms utilize share repurchases only when they wish to distribute large amounts of cash,
this limits their usefulness as a signal. The fact that aggregate dividend models estimated on data
from earlier periods continued to perform well even during the surge in repurchases in the mid1980s (Auerbach 1989) suggests that repurchases are not used primarily to substitute for
dividends, but may instead be reserved for circumstances in which firms have unexpectedly large
amounts of cash to be distributed.5
With new shares unattractive and repurchases not available as a regular policy tool, this
leaves dividends and debt as the two major financial variables that firms can adjust. If there
were an optimal debt-equity ratio and dividends were cost-less to adjust, this would cause
dividends to fluctuate as a residual of the investment process. Here, however, is where the
potential value of dividends as a signal becomes relevant. If firms seek to use dividends to
convey information about long-term value, there will be costs to adjusting dividends that must be
weighed against the costs of deviating from an optimal debt-equity ratio. We might then observe
fluctuations in debt-equity ratios being used to smooth dividends.
Figure 3 provides an illustration of the behavior one might expect from such a model.
This figure presents the patterns of dividends and investment derived from the solution of a
linearized version of a model, derived in the Appendix, in which firms face two types of
quadratic financial policy costs: one based on the deviation of dividends from their long-run
value (based on the firm’s normal earnings), and the other based on the level of the firm’s debt.
In response to an unanticipated permanent increase in the productivity of its capital stock, the
firm wishes to raise its capital stock to a new, higher level. However, doing so requires issuing
debt, reducing dividends, or both.
5

During that period, the extra cash came primarily from shifts in capital structure, as firms issued large amounts
of debt.

11

The figure illustrates the response of the firm to a permanent positive productivity shock
to production, beginning in period 1, with this information arriving during period 0, when
period-0 dividends are paid. We assume that period-0 production and debt levels are already
determined when the news arrives, so that the firm adjusts its period-0 dividends, borrowing and
investment. In the long run, dividends rise to a new level consistent with the higher level of
productivity (and capital), while investment falls back to zero.
The solid lines in the figure illustrate the pattern of dividend changes (relative to the
initial dividend level) and investment for one set of adjustment costs, and suggest several
observations. First, even though dividends rise eventually in response to the firm’s increase in
productivity, they fall in the short run to help finance investment. Second, they fall initially by
less than is needed to finance investment – the remaining funds come initially from increased
debt, which over time is paid off as dividends recover slightly less quickly than investment falls.
Third, investment itself is smoothed, even though there are no adjustment costs to investment
itself, to accommodate the costs of adjusting dividends and debt.
The figure’s dotted lines represent the dividend and investment paths for the case in
which the costs of adjusting dividends are higher. These higher costs induce more investment
smoothing, and also cause a greater share of the initial investment jump to be financed by
increased debt, rather than reduced dividends. In fact, dividends rise initially in period 0, even
though period-0 earnings are not affected by the productivity increase. With a strong enough
incentive to set dividends at their new, higher long-run level, the firm borrows initially not only
to invest, but also to pay dividends. However, the dividend level is still depressed relative to its
long-run dividend level. This illustrates the importance for conditioning dividend policy on firm
fundamentals in considering the responsiveness of dividends to investment.

12

As argued above, dividend smoothing poses little challenge to the new view if it occurs at
very high frequencies. The relevant empirical question is whether, even over longer periods,
dividends remain smooth even as investment fluctuates. In the limit, keeping dividends smooth
even in the face of a growing debt-equity ratio would ultimately make new share issues an
attractive alternative to additional borrowing. Firms with high costs of deviating from their
optimal debt-equity ratio and a strong desire to smooth dividends would then be forced into
issuing new shares, as the traditional view envisions. Likewise, firms unable to adjust dividends
upward would find themselves using share repurchases as a residual use of funds.
We wish to determine the extent to which firms do alter their dividend policies in
response to fluctuations in investment needs. The essence of our argument is that the use of
dividends as a signal, as represented by the well-known tendency of dividends to rise with a
firm’s prospects, is not necessarily inconsistent with the use of retained earnings as the marginal
source of equity funds. Even if firms set their dividends primarily to reflect long-run earnings
prospects, the combination of dividend adjustments and short-term borrowing can allow them to
accommodate fluctuations in the need for investment funds without regular use of new share
issues or share repurchases.
That is, the use of dividends as a signal does not imply that dividends will be set without
regard to other costs. Such insensitivity would imply that deviating from the optimal dividend
has infinite cost to the firm, but this seems extreme and unrealistic. For example, imagine a
signaling model in which there are two types of firms, “good” firms with a low cost of paying
dividends, and “bad” firms with a high cost of paying dividends. Suppose that each firm
receives an unobserved, temporary idiosyncratic shock to its cash flow that raises its cost of
paying dividends. Without such shocks, we might observe a separating equilibrium in which

13

good firms pay a higher dividend to distinguish themselves from bad firms. In the presence of
the shocks, such complete sorting could break down, and some of the good firms might find it
advantageous to lower their dividends temporarily, even if doing so reduced their value by
increasing their probability of being a bad firm, from the perspective of uninformed investors.
Thus, we would expect dividends to increase with an increase in the firm’s intrinsic
value, but to decrease with the firm’s need for investment funds, conditional on the firm’s value.
Conditional on investment needs, and the firm’s intrinsic value, dividends should also respond
positively to cash flow.
This discussion also highlights a potential identification problem that a test of the new
view faces. If dividends in the long run are a linear function of q, and investment is as well, then
the correlation between investment and dividends – holding q constant – is unidentified.
However, although investment is determined solely by intrinsic value in the model illustrated in
Figure 3, in a more realistic setting there are a variety of reasons why we might expect needed
investment funds to fluctuate, conditional on the firm’s value. First, investment may vary
independently, given that capital is not, in reality, homogenous and projects may be “lumpy” in
nature. So, for example, if in our sample there were two otherwise identical firms, one that had
purchased a new plant yesterday, and one that had not, then the firm who had just purchased the
plant should have lower dividends today. Second, the firm’s cash flow may vary, as a result of
nonrecurring revenues or tax benefits.
Our strategy, then, is to estimate the responsiveness to investment and cash flow while
controlling adequately for the strong dependence of these variables on the firm’s underlying
prospects. This approach is in the spirit of earlier work of Dhrymes and Kurz (1967), who
sought to characterize the joint decisions with respect to investment, dividends and external

14

finance using cross-section data, but goes beyond such work by using panel data to distinguish
long-run from short-run responses. While our argument is consistent with the observation that
fast-growing firms tend to retain a greater share of their earnings, it also predicts that such a
relationship holds for higher frequency fluctuations.

V.

The Data
We estimate equations to explain the firm’s common-stock dividends using an

unbalanced firm-level panel data set derived from the Compustat industrial, full-coverage, and
research files, for the period 1981-98.6 The variables are defined as follows. Investment equals
capital expenditures. Cash flow equals after-tax income7 plus depreciation. Value is the value of
the firm’s common stock. Debt is the sum of the firm’s financial obligations, including shortterm and long-term debt. Each of these variables is scaled by the firm’s assets at the beginning
of the period.
We delete all observations for firms with SIC codes between 60 and 69, corresponding to
the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate industries. These categories include financial companies
for which our model is not really suitable, as well as companies with special rules regarding
distributions, notably real estate investment trusts (REITs). We also exclude observations after
firms have undergone a major merger. Finally, to prevent the influence of questionable data, we
also omit a small number of observations with investment-assets ratios less than 0 or greater than
1, cash-flow-assets ratios less than –1 or greater than 1, dividend-asset ratios above .5, debt-asset
ratios greater than 1, or equity value-asset ratios greater than 20.
6

Given the use of lagged variables in our empirical specifications, our basic results cover dividend payments
beginning in 1982.
7

For after-tax income, we use “income before extraordinary items – available for common,” which is net of
preferred dividends. This is consistent with our exclusion of preferred dividends from our dividend measure.

15

Table 1 gives the sample means and standard deviations of the variables just defined.
The dividend-assets ratio is the average taken over all observations, including those that equal
zero. The average for those observations with positive dividends is substantially higher because,
as will be discussed shortly, our basic sample includes many observations with zero dividends.

VI.

Initial Results
A goal of our empirical work is to identify whether, conditional on value, dividends

appear to respond negatively to investment and positively to cash flow, and to measure the
relative responsiveness of these two reactions. It is also important to control for the firm’s initial
level of debt, to measure debt capacity and thereby account for the possibility of using additional
borrowing as a source of funds. Table 2 presents a series of initial estimates. Each column of
the table presents results for a model relating dividends (as a share of firm assets) to the levels of
lagged investment, cash flow, debt and value (also relative to assets). All specifications also
include dummy variables for each year in the sample, to account for trends in dividend levels
that might be attributable to a variety of common factors, including tax law changes and the
overall growth in the ratio of equity values to assets that occurred over this period.
The first column of Table 2 presents a simple linear model, based on all observations in
the sample. Below the coefficients in this and all subsequent panel specifications are robust
standard errors, based on the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the model’s errors. The
coefficients from this first set of results appear to support the implication of the “new view”
hypothesis that, conditional on value, cash flow should exert a positive impact on dividends, and
investment a negative impact. As expected, dividends are positively related to value, but this
does not eliminate the separate impact of investment and cash flow. The negative coefficient on

16

initial debt is consistent with our expectation that a higher debt level discourages firms from
additional borrowing and forces them to find alternative sources of funds.
In estimating the linear model, we make no special provision for the fact that so many
observations (63 percent of the total!) have a value of zero for the dependent variable, the ratio of
dividends to assets. The second column of Table 2 treats these zeros using the standard Tobit
specification, which substantially strengthens the impact of the investment and cash flow
variables. However, this is not necessarily the most sensible approach to dealing with zerodividend observations. Most of these observations occur among firms that have never paid
dividends in prior years. Although it represents more than half of the observations, this welldefined group of zero-dividend firms accounts for only 9 percent of the equity value of our
sample universe: these are most likely small “immature” firms for whom the paper’s hypothesis
clearly doesn’t yet apply. Dropping these observations eliminates 87 percent of the zerodividend observations.8
The results for the remaining firms, which we label “mature”, corresponding to the fullsample results just presented, are shown in the third and fourth columns of Table 2. Not
surprisingly, the Tobit and least squares results are now closer together, and both exhibit large
coefficients for both the cash flow and investment variables. However, because there are still a
substantial number of observations of zero dividends – 18 percent of the mature sample – the
Tobit model seems more appropriate. And, given that the results are still noticeably different
from those of the linear model, we will present results in subsequent tables for the Tobit model.
One might explain the findings thus far as simply reflecting long-run differences among
firms, rather than short-run changes in dividend policy. That is, perhaps some fast-growing
8

In order to avoid selection based on future information, we drop observations based only on past behavior, i.e.,
observations for firms with no dividends in the current observation or in any past observations.

17

firms invest a lot and pay small dividends (relative to assets), while other firms grow slowly,
investing little and paying large dividends. While our theory concerns the short-run
responsiveness of dividends to investment needs and cash flow resources, our estimates might
reflect not only these responses, but also more permanent cross-section variation among firms.
To eliminate the influence of this long-run cross-section variation, a simple if inelegant
correction is to include fixed firm effects in the equation. However, this approach is problematic
for two reasons. First, it is not a feasible solution for the Tobit model. There do exist procedures
for overcoming this problem of nonlinearity (see, for example, Honoré 1992). But a second
problem, even for the linear model, is that fixed effects estimation may lead to inconsistent
estimates in a short panel, given that the right-hand side variables in the estimated equation are
predetermined but not exogenous regressors. To avoid this problem and still eliminate the
influence of firm effects, one might adopt the approach suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991).
This method involves estimation of the differenced equation using the Generalized Method of
Moments (GMM) using twice lagged regressors (in levels) as instruments. However, given the
lack of good instruments, this approach, too, presents problems. Some progress has been made
dealing with weak instruments, through the use of “system” GMM estimation that
simultaneously estimates the levels equation using differenced lagged regressors as instruments
(Blundell and Bond 1998). However, given that our overall sample and most subsamples include
a considerable number of zero-dividend observations, we seek a solution that can be applied in
the context of Tobit estimation.9

9

For one of the subsamples analyzed below, in the second column of Table 6, linear estimation is possible
because there are no zero-dividend observations. We reestimated this model using the system GMM approach. The
coefficients were of the same sign as those in the second column of Table 6, and the coefficients on the investment
and cash flow variables were considerably larger in absolute value and statistically significant, even in the one-stage
estimates. However, the test for no second-order serial correlation was rejected for these estimates.

18

As our alternative, we include a very large number of dummy variables to account for
inter-firm differences. These dummy variables include approximately 360 industry dummies10
and four size dummies, respectively for firms with assets below the sample median, between the
median and the 75th percentile, between the 75th and 90th percentiles, and above the 90th
percentile. Finally, to account for more dynamics in the dividend response, we add an additional
lagged value for each of the independent variables. We adopt this approach to dynamic
specification, rather than the alternative of including a lagged dependent variable, because of the
likelihood of serial correlation among the within-firm residuals that would lead to inconsistent
parameter estimates of this and hence other coefficients. The results of these additions are
reflected in the last two columns of Table 2.11 Even with the large set of control variables, the
patterns remain the same. The additional lag of each variable has the same, predicted sign as the
initial lag, and usually is statistically significant.
Thus far, our results suggest that dividends are sensitive to cash flow and investment.
This is particularly so for those specifications controlling for the decision to pay dividends.
However, we should expect this sensitivity to vary according to firm characteristics, notably the
access the firm has to external capital markets. We utilize two measures of market access to
divide our sample and gain some initial insight into this relationship. Our first cut is according to
whether (according to Compustat) the firm has a bond rating. Our second measure is derived
from data provided by I/B/E/S International, Inc., which tracks analysts’ forecasts for the firms
they follow. Not all firms have analysts’ forecasts reported, and having such forecasts is a
measure of the degree to which the capital market has information about a firm. We should

10

We use 4-digit industry dummies based on SIC codes, except in a handful of instances in which a 4-digit
industry has just a few observations. In these cases, we group contiguous 4-digit industries.
11

The reduction is sample size is due to the inclusion of additional lags.

19

expect firms with a bond rating and a record of I/B/E/S analysts’ forecasts to have the greatest
access to capital markets. As most firms with a bond rating also have an I/B/E/S record, we
consider three categories of firms: those with both, those followed by I/B/E/S but with no bond
rating, and those with neither a bond rating nor an I/B/E/S record.
The effects of this sample division are shown in Table 3. Because Compustat does not
provide bond ratings before 1985, this reduces our sample size somewhat. However, as one sees
in the first column of the table – which repeats the model estimated in the last column of Table 2
for this shorter sample – the results are little affected by this attrition. There is some difference
between the two I/B/E/S samples shown in the next two columns. Those without bond ratings
evidence a somewhat higher sensitivity to cash flow and investment than those with bond
ratings. The last sample, without a bond rating or an I/B/E/S, exhibits even greater sensitivity.
These results suggest that capital market access is at least one of the underlying explanations for
firm responsiveness to investment and cash flow conditions, confirming that this response is
measuring the extent of the firm’s dependence on internal funds.

VII. Accounting for External Equity Policy
The model estimated thus far ignores the question of whether firms issue or repurchase
shares, considering only the impact of investment and cash flow on dividend policy. However,
there are two reasons to take into account the firm’s simultaneous decision to enter the external
equity market. First, identifying the determinants of whether a firm issues new shares or
repurchases may help us identify those firms likely to be subject to capital market constraints, in
a more sophisticated manner than that provided by the simple sample breakdowns just
considered. Second, a firm’s dividend policy responsiveness may vary according to whether it
actually enters the capital market. For example, if a firm does overcome the fixed costs of
20

issuing equity, it may then find it optimal to issue a substantial amount and depend less on
depressing its dividend. Both of these factors suggest that firms likely to issue equity, whether
because of permanent characteristics or temporary conditions, may be less likely to use dividend
fluctuations as a source of equity capital.
We model the representative firm’s new share/repurchase decision using a bivariate
probit model. Included in the model are all variables from the dividend equations of Table 3,
along with dummy variables corresponding to different bond ratings and the number of analysts
recorded in the I/B/E/S data for the firm. Including these variables as a series of dummies is the
most general way to estimate how capital market access relates to each of them.
Table 4 present the results of this bivariate probit estimation. The coefficients on
investment, cash, and debt are all opposite across the two equations, all of the predicted sign and,
in most cases, highly significant. High investment, low cash flow, and high debt all make new
issues more likely, and repurchases less likely. Next to each column of coefficients is the
implied marginal effect of each variable, evaluated at the means of all independent variables.
The coefficients are generally somewhat larger in magnitude than those of the dividend
equations, indicating that external equity decisions are relatively sensitive to a firm’s current
situation.
Note, also, that in each of the equations, the coefficients on cash flow and investment are
of the same absolute magnitude. A Wald test that the sum of the two investment coefficients
equals the sum of the two cash flow coefficients is accepted at all standard levels of significance,
for both equations. This is an important finding, for it undercuts a key assumption of the
traditional view argument for a net impact of dividend taxes, namely that external equity is more
responsive to investment than to subsequent cash flow that the investment generates.

21

The correlation of the two decisions is nearly –1, suggesting that they are determined by
only a single latent variable. That is, we may view the process in terms of an ordered probit in
which firms determine a desired level of new issues, positive or negative, choosing to repurchase
if the desired level is below some critical value, to issue if the desired level is above some critical
value, and to do neither if the desired level is between the two critical values, presumably
because of the transaction costs of entering the equity market. This decision process is depicted
in Figure 4, which shows a distribution of desired share issues (negative if repurchases) and the
two critical values, labeled y1 and y2.
Variables that shift the position of the distribution of desired share issues in Figure 4
relate to the level of cash needed relative to the amount available, and should have an opposite
impact on new issues and repurchases. These variables include debt, investment and cash flow,
which we have already discussed. The importance of such shifts is reflected in the fact that the
sample correlation of new share issue probability and repurchase probability is –.45. Variables
related to capital market access, though, may have similar effects on the two decisions, by
widening or narrowing the gap between the limits y1 and y2. Candidates for this category include
the firm’s bond rating and the number of analysts following the firm. The coefficients for these
measures are displayed (with standard-error bounds) in Figures 5 and 6, the values listed for each
bond-rating or number of analysts indicating the effect relative to firms with no bond rating or no
recorded analysts. The categories for each measure are ordered so that capital market access
should increase as one moves from left to right, in the direction of firms with higher bond ratings
and more analysts’ coverage.
The patterns suggest that the probability of repurchasing does indeed generally increase
with bond rating and analysts’ coverage. The opposite is true of new issues, but this pattern is

22

not necessarily inconsistent with our hypothesis that these variables measure capital market
access. Note, in particular, that relative to firms without a bond rating or analysts’ coverage, new
issues are more likely for firms with low bond rating and a small number of analysts. That is,
there is a nonmonotonic relationship between capital market access and the probability of new
share issues, increasing at first and then decreasing. This is perfectly understandable, once we
recall that the firm has the option of borrowing as well, and is likely for tax reasons to prefer
using borrowed funds to issuing new equity. Firms with the highest credit ratings may therefore
choose to borrow before issuing new shares; those with lower credit ratings may be compelled to
issue new shares, and those with no credit ratings may find neither option available and opt for
internal funds.
With these results in hand, we can return to the question of heterogeneity of dividend
responses. Table 5 presents results for four sub-samples of firms, according to their estimated
probabilities of repurchasing or issues shares. We divide firms roughly into thirds according to
each marginal probability distribution, labeling those in the bottom third as having a low
probability and those in the top third as having a high probability. We then look at the high- and
low- probability groups separately, leaving out the middle group in each case to reduce the noise
of our sample separation process.
While there is no clear pattern for firms with high and low probabilities of repurchasing,
the difference between firms with low and high probabilities of issuing new shares is much more
evident. This difference provides support for the hypothesis that firms with weaker capital
market access – as measured by the likelihood of issuing new shares – rely more heavily on
internal funds. Indeed, these results are striking in light of the remaining heterogeneity likely to

23

be present within the low-probability sample – some of the firms relying less on new issues may
be relying more on debt, as discussed above in connection to Figures 5 and 6.
This heterogeneity is evidenced by the fact that the low-probability sample has the
greatest shares of firms at two extremes. It has the highest concentration of firms with neither a
bond rating nor an I/B/E/S record (2901 observations, or 42 percent of all such observations,
compared to 1610 – 23 percent – for the high-probability sample). But it also has the vast
preponderance of observations for firms with a high bond rating and a large number of analysts.
Of the 1034 observations with a bond rating of at least A+ and more than 15 analysts’ forecasts
reported by I/B/E/S – the categories with negative coefficients for the respective variables in
Figures 5 and 6 – 811 observations are in the low probability sample and just 41 are in the highprobability sample. These 811 observations account for 11 percent of the observations in the low
probability sample, but 58 percent of that sample’s equity value. Moreover, none of these
observations are censored (having zero dividends), even though such observations comprise 14
percent of the low-probability sample.
As a simple attempt to deal with this heterogeneity, we rerun the model for the lowprobability new-issue sample separately for those firms with a bond rating of at least A+ and
more than 15 analysts. The result, given in the first two columns of Table 6, confirm that the
large firms with a high bond-rating and a large number of analysts exhibit less sensitivity to cash
flow and investment than the remainder of the low-probability sample, but still somewhat greater
sensitivity than firms in the high-probability sample.12

12

The results for this sub-sample are identical to those obtained using OLS (because there are no censored
observations). The adjusted R2 for this regression is .828. This is much higher than that in the fifth column of Table
2, for the same specification estimated on the entire sample of mature firms, confirming the presence of considerable
heterogeneity in that earlier sample.

24

Further evidence of the greater dividend sensitivity of firms with weak capital-market
attachment comes from the last two columns of Table 6, in which we consider two samples of
observations, those below the mean probability both of issuing new shares and repurchasing, and
those above the mean probability for both events. The responsiveness to both investment and
cash flow is clearly greater for the low-probability group.

VIII. Time Series Results
Thus far, all of our analysis has concerned responsiveness of dividend policy at the firm
level; every specification has included time dummies to control for aggregate variables,
including tax policy. Given the length of our panel, we are limited in our ability to carry out
aggregate analysis. However, there are a couple of exercises that will be useful to shed further
light on the results presented thus far.
The first question is whether there have been important changes over time in patterns of
financial behavior. As discussed above, spurts of repurchasing in the 1980s and again in recent
years have led to the suggestion of such a shift. However, to what extent are trends present, once
we control for other determinants of financial activity? Figure 7 presents the time dummies from
the bivariate probit in Table 4 for repurchasing and new share issues, with 1985 taken as the
benchmark. Except perhaps for the upward spike in the repurchase dummy in 1998, there is no
obvious trend in either variable. Indeed, the two series exhibit cyclical behavior, with new issues
becoming more likely, and repurchases less likely, around the period just after the 1990-91
recession, when prospects for improving profitability may have spurred investment that
outstripped the internal funds available for firms just exiting a period of low profits.
As to trends in dividends, we have noted that many of our observations are for firms that
pay no dividends at all. Indeed, the propensity of firms to pay dividends has fallen over time.
25

Fama and French 2000 argue that this is due in part to the changing composition of the universe
of firms. It is useful, though, to inquire how much of the aggregate trend can be explained by the
factors as we considered in our panel estimation. That is, we will estimate a “between”
regression trying to explain the time series behavior of dividends, starting with the same model
used in the “within” (time periods) estimates already presented.
The dependent variable for this model is the series of time dummies from a representative
dividend equation, that for all mature firms given in the first column of Table 3. We construct
the cash flow, investment, value, and debt variables, and the assets variable used to deflate them,
using parallel definitions to the extent possible with data from the National Income and Product
Accounts and the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Accounts.13 The resulting regressions are
shown in Table 7. The estimates in the table’s first column, for a model with just a constant and
time trend, show that there is a significant time trend in our data as well. The second column
provides estimates for our standard model. The second lags of all the explanatory variables are
quite insignificant; dropping them yields the results in the third column of Table 7. As the
results in these two columns illustrate, inclusion of our explanatory variables does not succeed in
eliminating (or even reducing) the time trend. Clearly, there is something going on over time in
addition to what our model explains. On the other hand, the variables in our model have the
same effects as those found in the micro regressions. Indeed, cash flow and, particularly,
investment have effects that are even larger than in the micro estimates.
One must take some care in interpreting this result, because there are other factors
influencing behavior at the macro level. An obvious candidate is tax policy, as represented by
13

From NIPA, investment equals nonresidential investment and cash flow equals after-tax corporate profits
plus the capital consumption allowance for the corporate sector excluding Finance, Insurance and Real Estate. From
the FOF balance sheets, assets, debt and value are for the nonfinancial corporate sector; assets are tangible assets at
historic cost; debt is credit market debt; value is net worth, at market value.

26

the tax discrimination variable, (1-θ)/(1-c) commonly used in time series regressions to explain
dividend behavior. We construct this variable using values of θ and c for households obtained
from the NBER’s TAXSIM model, adjusted for the share of equity held by tax-exempt investors,
as reported by the Flow of Funds Accounts for each year.14 The last column of Table 7 shows
the impact of including this variable, lagged one period to avoid possible simultaneity
problems.15 The tax variable has the predicted sign (lower taxes – a higher value of the tax
variable – leads to higher dividends), although it is insignificant. But it leaves the investment
and cash flow variables significant. That dividends, in the aggregate, do respond to these
variables is illustrated in Figure 8, which graphs the regression relationship of the dependent
variable (the dividend dummy) to investment, i.e., after each has been purged of the part
predictable by the other regressors in this last equation.

IX.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that firms in the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector do vary their

dividends in response to cash flow, investment, and debt. That is, they use retained earnings to
supply a portion of their marginal investment funds. The sensitivity of this response depends on
firm characteristics, as those firms we identify as having weak capital-market access – with no
bond rating or analysts on record – are more sensitive in their dividend decisions than are other
firms. These firms are less likely to issue new shares than is the typical firm, and so it makes
sense that they would be more likely to use retained earnings as a source of funds. On the other

14

We include in this category the holdings of state and local governments, state and local government
retirement funds, pension funds and foreign investors. The taxable share ranges between .65 and .69 over the
sample period.
15

Including the current value of (1-θ)/(1-c) instead led to similar results. The one-period-ahead value, when
included, had an extremely small effect.

27

hand, another group of firms that are relatively unlikely to issue new shares consists of those at
the other extreme – with high bond ratings and a large number of analysts following them.
These firms’ dividends appear only slightly more responsive to cash needs than the group we
project as likely to issue shares. However, the former group also has greater access to borrowing
than does the typical firm in the group likely to issue shares, and so may well be relying on debt,
rather than external equity, as a source of funds. But heavier reliance on debt does not, in itself,
represent a rejection of the most important implication of the new view of equity policy, that
provisions to reduce the tax burden on dividends will have no impact on the cost of capital. This
result will still be true if firms use dividends and debt together to finance marginal investment
without reliance on new share issues.
Indeed, even the presence of new issues and repurchases appears to be consistent with
this key implication of the new view, if they respond not only to investment but also to cash
flow. Our probit results support the hypothesis that new issues (and repurchases) account for the
same marginal share of the sources of investment funds and the uses of cash flow. We
constructed similar tests of equality in our dividend equations, rejecting all in favor of larger cash
flow coefficients. This rejection may constitute partial support for the traditional view, but it
also may simply reflect the imperfect nature of firm equity value as a control for future
profitability, with some of this effect being picked up by the investment variable. To the extent
that such a problem is less severe at the aggregate level, this argument is supported by the time
series results in Table 7, for which the investment coefficient was substantially larger in
magnitude.
Thus, we have found strong support for the hypothesis that dividends do respond to
investment as well as to cash flow, a key tenet of the new view. We have found further support

28

for an extended version of the new view in the result that, while new share issues are also quite
responsive to investment, they are equally responsive to increases in cash flow. This undercuts a
key element of the reasoning in favor of the traditional view that dividend taxes raise the cost of
capital.
Ultimately, though, there is no reason to argue that one view is “correct” and another is
“incorrect.” What matters for tax policy decisions is the relative importance of the different
views, in terms of the extent to which dividend taxes affect the cost of capital. Our results
suggest that standard calculations based on a model in which dividend taxes affect all
distributions but no marginal funds is clearly invalid. But we have not proved that dividend
taxes have no effect at all.
In a world in which firms vary in the responsiveness of their dividends and their ability to
issue new shares, the more accurate model may be a hybrid in which funds are drawn from
different sources, the weights depending on the relative costs of doing so. Estimating the
parameters of such a model is beyond the scope of the present paper. Presumably, it would first
require more progress in direction taken in this paper’s appendix, extending the approach to
include the costs faced by firms in making adjustments at different margins.

the capital stock at date t, δ the rate at which capital decays, Bt the stock of debt at date t, it the
interest rate on this debt, and τ the corporate tax rate applicable to interest deductions. To reflect
non-tax borrowing costs, we express it as an increasing function of leverage:

(A4)

Ft (⋅) = θ t G(⋅)

30

To analyze the firm’s behavior over time, we derive first-order conditions for Kt and Bt
using (A1) - (A4) and linearize these conditions around a steady state where θ = θ* = 1. The
resulting solution for the capital stock can be expressed as a partial adjustment model:

(A5)

(

K t − K t −1 = (1 − λ1 ) Kˆ t − K t −1

)

where

and

(A7)

where λ2 > 1 >λ1 are the two roots of the second-order difference equation in K, γ = -G′′/G′
measures the curvature of the production function, and x = (ρ + δ)/β(1-τ).
$ , of the
According to (A6) - (A7), the firm targets a forward-looking weighted average, K
~
optimal “spot” capital stock, K , which deviates from K ∗ based on the productivity of K ∗ (both
directly and through the impact of dividend smoothing, as represented in (A7) by the term
multiplied by α). The partial adjustment itself is motivated by this same incentive to smooth
dividends.
Corresponding to this optimal investment path is one for dividends,

(A8)

(

)

Dt − D ∗ = −(1 + γx )( K t +1 − K t ) + ρ K t − K ∗ + x(θ t +1 − 1) + G ∗ − x(1 + ρ ) (θ t − 1)

31

If we define dt = (D* - Dt)/( Kt+1 - Kt) to be the share of investment financed by deviations
in dividends form their long-run value, we can solve for dt by comparing (A8) and (A5), for a
particular path of θ. In Figure 3, we trace out the response to a once-and-for-all increase in θ to
θ* at the end of period 0, after period -0 production occurs but before dividends are determined.
This yields (after some algebra):

(

)

 ( λ 2 − 1) 1 + ρ + γG ∗





t=0
t >0

The difference at date 0 is caused by the fact that productivity is lower in that period (θ0<1).
This has a direct impact on the ability to pay dividends (see (A8)) and also influences the value
~
of K1 , the desired capital stock in period 1 (see (A7)).
The alternative paths in Figure 3 are for different values of α, the dividend-smoothing
parameter.
