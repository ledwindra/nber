Do Good Reports Mean Higher Prices? The Impact of Hospital Compare Ratings on Cardiac
Pricing

NBER Working Paper No. 22858
November 2016
JEL No. I11,L11
ABSTRACT
Previous research found that the initiation of Hospital Compare (HC) quality reporting had little
impact on patient outcomes. However little is known about its impact on hospital prices, which
may be significant since insurers are positioned to respond to quality information when engaging
hospitals in price negotiations. To explore this issue we estimate variants of difference-indifference models allowing HC impacts to vary by levels of quality scores. We separately
examine the effects of the three main scores (heart attack, heart failure, and combined mortalities)
on transaction prices of two related cardiac procedures: bypass surgery and angioplasty. States
which had mandated reporting systems preceding HC form the control group. Analyzing claims
data of privately insured patients, we find that HC exerted downward pressure on prices, which
we attribute to competitive pressures. However, hospitals ranked “above average” captured
higher prices, thereby offsetting the overall policy effect. We conclude that HC was effective at
constraining prices without penalizing high performers.

Introduction

Consumer information in the form of hospital rating systems known as ‘reports cards’ have been
in existence in various forms as early as the 1990s. However, such report cards were made
available in a small number of states that generated them independently from each other, while
employing a mix of measures and ranking methodologies. In 2005, the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched a uniform on-line national rating system, known as
Hospital Compare (HC), aimed at informing consumers and promoting competition among
hospitals. Initially, HC consisted of a set of process measures of hospital performance based on
general practices. 1 In 2008, these were augmented with outcome-based measures, namely
mortality-based hospital rankings which were deemed to be more easily understood by patients,
and more effective at motivating hospitals to engage in quality improvement practices (Harris,
2007).
In practice, opinion surveys have shown that consumers were generally unaware or
uninterested in these rankings, even as they had become more accessible, and there is little
evidence in the empirical literature to suggest that hospital report cards had an impact on
consumer choices of hospitals. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that hospital
administrators and executives were ostensibly responsive to these rankings, there is similarly
little evidence that HC and other report cards have had a significant impact on patient outcomes.
We briefly review the literature in the next section.

The set of 26 process measures range from providing aspirin to arriving patients with heart attacks and ACE
inhibitors to hospitalized heart failure patients, to discontinuing antibiotic treatment after surgery to avoid resistance;
the full listing of instruments is available in https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-AssessmentInstruments/HospitalQualityInits/Downloads/HospitalHQA2004_2007200512.pdf

A less explored channel through which public reporting might impact health care
markets, and ultimately patients, is hospital pricing. In the private segment of the health care
market, private insurers rather than individual patients face the main part of the price. As group
purchasers, large insurance firms and managed care organizations who engage in price
negotiations with hospitals are more likely to incorporate information from public reporting in
their decision-making (Dor, Encinosa, Carey, 2015; Reinhardt, 2006, 2009). However, there is a
paucity of evidence on the impact of HC on hospital pricing. An earlier study suggested the
initiation of HC reporting contributed to a slowing in the rate of price increases of related
hospital procedures (Dor et al., 2015), but it did not address the issue of the responsiveness of
prices to rating differences as flagged by Hospital Compare. Yet in a well-functioning market, a
hospital’s ability to deliver better health outcomes should lead to greater demand and bargaining
power for the hospital, and hence be rewarded by higher prices (Brooks et al., 1997). In this
paper, we fill the gap by examining the relationship between publicly reported hospital ratings
and inpatient prices, allowing for hospital differentiation by relative rankings. Specifically, we
conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of the HC measures, as implemented in 2008,
on actual prices negotiated and transacted between private insurers and U.S. hospitals. These
measures are the HC categorical rankings based on hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates for the
three medical conditions made available on-line as of 2008, which included heart attack, heart
failure, and pneumonia. We focus on prices of major cardiac procedures related to heart attacks
and heart failure. Results suggest that HC exerts downward pressure on prices, but that this
effect is offset for hospitals ranked in the highest quality category.
We note that in public discourse there is considerable confusion between hospital billing
data, such as those CMS began to release in 2013, and actual payments made to hospitals,

4

namely transaction prices (Meier et al., 2013). Using a claims database for large private insurers
we focus our analysis on transaction prices. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II
provides background on hospital report cards and hospital pricing. Section III lays out the
analytical framework, including data and sample, estimation strategy, and variable specification.
Section IV presents descriptive results for the comparisons of the pre and post Hospital Compare
initiation year in control versus treatment states, and the program effects of the intervention.
Section V discusses implications. The full regression models are provided in Appendix A.

Background

Public Reporting of Hospital Performance
Information about hospital quality performance began appearing in the public domain in the
1990s. An early review of the gains from public disclosure of performance data found that
consumers showed little interest in or use of the available information due to various reasons
including difficulty in understanding, failure to trust in, and lack of timely access to the data
(Marshall et al., 2000). Anecdotal surveys of hospital administrators and executives are more
positive, with most reporting increased investment in quality improvement in response to the
newly created report cards (Laschober et al., 2006). More recent study of public reporting
suggests that information included in hospital report cards may be disconnected from consumer
decision-making because of weakness in content, design, and accessibility even as information
became more widely disseminated (Sinaiko et al., 2012). Such policy discourse even prompted
the California Hospital Association to review and withdraw support for state report cards due to
perceived lack of value to users (Teleki and Shannon, 2012).

5

In some respects, the empirical literature tends to lend support to the view that hospital
report cards have limited effect on patient choices and medical outcomes. For instance, Dranove
and Sfekas (2008) found that the hospital report cards in New York State had little impact on
choices of hospitals by consumers and on hospital market share and Wang et al. (2011) found no
significant effects of mortality-based scores in Pennsylvania report cards on hospital volume.
Turning to outcomes, Ryan et al. (2012) found that the requirement for hospitals to report
process of care measures under the earlier wave of Hospital Compare did not lead to reductions
in 30-day mortality rates for heart attack and pneumonia, and had only minimal impact on heart
failure mortality. Moreover, choosing reportedly high performing hospitals in New York State
did not decrease a patient’s chance of dying following coronary intervention (Chen et al., 2012).
More recently, Dor, Encinosa, and Carey (2015) began to explore a different channel through
which report cards might affect providers and patients, namely by mitigating hospital prices.
They found that the introduction of excess mortality measures in Hospital Compare slowed the
rate of increase in prices of related cardiac procedures overall. They speculated that the mere
injection of quality information, albeit imperfect, into the healthcare market weakens the
competitive position of hospitals in hospital-insurer negotiations. 2 However, they did not
differentiate between hospitals by their relative rankings, and thus were unable to establish
whether better ranked hospitals were able to capture a “rating premium” or if they were
penalized by pricing pressures to the same extent as lower-ranked hospitals.
Studies of Cardiac Procedure Pricing

2

Silber et al [2010] demonstrate that hospital mortality scores are sensitive to model specification. For instance they
show that adding volume and hospital staffing to bed ratios that are omitted in the Hospital Compare methodology
improved predictability. Note however that from the perspective of evaluating Hospital Compare we are interest in
the impact of publically available report cards rather than constructs available to researchers only.

6

Previous studies examined pricing of cardiac services including coronary artery bypass surgery and
angioplasty. Dor, Grossman, and Koroukian (2004) used a bargaining model to derive price
models that reflect the dynamics of the hospital-insurer interaction. Results indicated that health
maintenance organizations (HMOs) are able to capture larger price discounts from hospitals than
more open forms of managed care such as point-of-service (POS) plans and preferred provider
organizations (PPOs), a result the authors attributed to the HMO’s ability to exercise greater
bargaining power due to large-volume purchasing. In a related paper, Dor, Koroukian and
Grossman (2004) explored the impact of standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for coronary artery
bypass surgery and for angioplasty on their corresponding prices. As expected, adverse quality had
a negative impact on prices; however, this result was not statistically significant. While these
scores reflected the type of report card information available in certain states during the period
studied (1994-1996), and potentially to some private insurers, they were not widely disseminated;
this contrasts with the risk-standardized SMRs (RSMR) that were used in subsequent years to
construct the categorical quality ratings reported in Hospital Compare. Broader dissemination of
the information in recent years may yield more significant effects of adverse quality on prices than
found in the earlier period.

III.

Analytical Framework

Data and Study Population
The main patient and price data consist of the Truven Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims
and Encounters database (CCE). This database assembles complete insurance claims for
approximately 100 medium-size and large employers previously used in nationally
representative population-based studies (Zhou et al., 2005; Hansen and Chang, 2011). The

7

advantage of using the CCE database is that it reports actual transaction prices paid by patients
and insurers. Prices are adjusted for local differences by the wage index from the CMS Cost
Reports, then inflation adjusted to 2010 dollars. Hospital Compare (HC) ratings come from the
CMS Hospital Compare database. In the CMS methodology, they are derived from post
discharge risk-standardized 30-day mortality, but are displayed as a categorical score that take
one of three values (“Better than,” “No Different than,” and “Worse than” the U.S. national rate).
Other hospital characteristics were obtained from the American Hospital Association Annual
Surveys. The full census of inpatients from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was used
to create market concentration ratios for hospitalized patients undergoing cardiac procedures.
Finally, the Managed Market Surveyor File from InterStudy provided the market area HMO
penetration rates.
We extracted claims for hospitalizations for non-elderly employees and dependents
undergoing coronary revascularization, comprising coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), formerly referred to as PTCA (angioplasty). In
addition to being associated with cardiac conditions featured in HC, CABG and PCI are among
the most common major medical procedures in the U.S. healthcare system, with over 1 million
procedures performed annually (DeFrances et al., 2008). They also are among the most costly,
accounting together for over $3.5 billion in 2007 (CMS, 2010), an amount larger than for any
other medical or surgical procedure except for hip and knee replacement (Epstein et al., 2011).
CABG and PCI occur relatively frequently compared with other cardiac procedures, and tend to
be well defined in claims data for purposes of price estimation.
Our database observes a large proportion of all CABGs and PCI procedures covered by
private insurers in 1,288 and 706 hospitals respectively. We merged the above data files for the

8

years 2005-2010. This allowed us to conduct analysis on impacts of the quality measures after
their introduction in 2008, as well as a comparison before and after the 2005-2007 phase-in
period. After excluding small hospitals with less than 10 procedures and patients who
underwent non-cardiac procedures in the same hospitalizations, our sample consisted of 53,765
observations on CABG patients and 24,441 observations on PCI patients. The distribution of
patients undergoing CABG and PCI according to quality rankings are displayed in Table 1.
Seven states had reporting systems for hospital quality metrics based on mortality rates
following revascularization procedures: California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, and Washington. We included only six states in this group because
hospitals in the state of Washington participated in the reporting system on a voluntary basis. We
characterize all other states as the intent-to-treat group, since none had report cards of their own
prior to the initiation of the federal Hospital Compare. Appendix Table A.1 displays the years in
which reporting systems were in effect in each of the control states.
Estimation Strategy
We initially define a simple difference-in-differences (DD) estimator for the treatment effect of
Hospital Compare (HC) from the perspective of states without state reporting systems (intent-totreat states). The change in hospital price due to the initiation of Hospital Compare in all states
can be described as
ΔPHC = [E(PNR| post HC treatment) − E(PNR| pre HC treatment)] –
[E(PR| post HC treatment) − E(PR| pre HC treatment)]
Where NR is an indicator for intent-to-treat states having no state report card systems prior to HC
initiation. At the individual admission level we have
Pihjt = a0 + a1HCt-1 + a2NRijt + a3HCt-1*NRijt
9

(1)

P is price for the individual hospital admission, where i indexes the patient admission, h indexes
the hospital, j indexes state, and t indexes year, HC is an indicator for the post implementation
period. The effect of HC on the intent-to-treat group of states is given by a3. 3
Adjusting for characteristics of the admission in question we obtain the estimating
equation
Pihjt = a0 + a1HCt-1 + a2NRijt + a3HCt-1*NRijt + a4Zijt + fh + ft + eihjt

(2)

Where in addition to the variables previously defined, Z is a vector of medical characteristics of
the admission and insurance type (as described in Appendix Table A.3), fh and ft are binary
indicators for hospital and year fixed effects, and eihjt is a random error term. HC enters the
model with a one year lag because prices in insurance contracts are fixed in a given year t and
can adjust only at the next annual update. Note that while a3 in equation (1) and (2) can be taken
as the treatment effect on price levels, it does not account for differences in reported quality
(mortality) scores as flagged in Hospital Compare.
Next, we expand equation (2) to allow the impact of the policy to vary by the intensity of
the treatment. More specifically, we will allow the effect of HC to depend on the reported
hospital mortality score, Qh. Noting that Qh applies to the intent-to-treat states after, but not prior
to the initiation of HC, we obtain the following estimating equation:
Pihjt = a0 + a1HCt-1 + a2NRijt + a3HCt-1*NRijt + a4HCt-1*Qh,t-1
+ a5HCt-1*NRijt*Qh,t-1+ a6Zijt + fh + ft + eihjt

3

This is the familiar case whereby ∆ = [(a1 + a2 + a3) - a2] - [a1 - 0] = a3.

10

(3)

Here the second level interactions control for post-HC trend in the intent-to-treat group
independently from the mortality scores (a3), and for the national trend in the HC mortality
scores (a4). The third level interaction gives the incremental program effect (a5), namely the
effect of the HC mortality scores (lagged a year) on prices after the initiation of HC, in intent-totreat states. The lag in Q accounts for last year’s published quality scores in the current year’s
hospital-insure contract. This estimation strategy is similar to using a continuous variable to
define varying policy impacts within the distribution of observations in the treatment group, as
found in Finkelstein (2007) 4, and Chou et al., 2014. Although model 3 appears notationally
analogous to the familiar difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD), here the main program
effect is given by the same bi-level interaction term as in the basic DD model, rather than the
triple interaction term.
To see how the full policy effect is derived, we note the expected value analogue
of equation (3):
ΔPHC(Q) = [E(PNR(QNR)| post HC treatment) − E(PNR| pre HC treatment)] –
[E(PR(QR)| post HC treatment) − E(PR(QR)| pre HC treatment)]
Substituting in the parameters of (3) we have
∆PHC(Q) = [(a1 + a2 + a3 + a4*E(Q|NR=1) + a5 E(Q|NR=1)) - a2] - [(a1+ a4*E(Q|NR=0)) - 0] =
a3 + a4*(E(Q|NR=1) - E(Q|NR=0)) +a5 E(Q|NR=1)

(4)

Henceforth we refer to eq. (4) as the full DD model and (2) as the naïve DD model. Note that a3
from equations (3) and (4) are equal if either a4=0 or [E(Q|NR=1)-E(Q|NR=0)] =0, and if a5=0.
4

Finkelstein employed a continuous variable such as the local area senior population share, interacted with a posttreatment dummy to analyze interrupted trends due to the introduction of Medicare. Chou et al use density of
obstetrics hospitals as the impact variable in a DD analysis of expansions in maternity benefits in Taiwan.

11

Thus the implicit premium paid to hospitals for being highly ranked is decomposed into two
effects, a direct effect due to scoring levels in the treated states (a5) and a relative effect when the
group is compared with controls. 5
Note that differencing requires Pihjt to be specified linearly. We estimate the linear
models with hospital fixed effects using the generalized method of moments (GMM). This
method provides heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, and is more efficient than robust OLS
(Hansen, 2016). Additionally GMM has been shown to be appropriate in panel data estimation
when the number of states and individual observations is large, while the number of periods is
small, (Hausman and Kuersteiner, 2008). These conditions are met in our data. 6 We ran four
models on the CABG and on the PCI samples, including the naive DD model and three full DD
models corresponding to the flagged quality scores for heart attacks, heart failure, and for the
combined scores. The baseline DD estimates are reported in Appendix Table A.3 and the full
DD models are reported in Appendix Table A.4.
There are several reasons to assume that the HC scores are orthogonal to the error term in
equations 1 through 4. First, the scores are hospital level variables, whereas prices are measured
at the patient level. Second, the HC scores are calculated from a complex transformation of
underlying mortality.7 Third, although the published HC scores are the reference measure in
5

Empirically the term in the middle disappears, both because a4 is non-significant and because the Q’s for
intervention and control states are similarly distributed. In practice we estimate the policy effect as a3 +
a5E(Q|NR=1). See Table 4.
6
Hausman and Kuersteiner (2008) define a ‘’large’’ number of states at 50. Our data contain 49 states plus
the District of Columbia, and a large sample of individuals, i.e N= 53,765 and N= 24,441 in the CABG and
PCI samples.

7

The Hospital Compare categories are drawn from a highly transformed excess mortality variable. To summarize,
prior to being grouped into categories, the underlying mortality scores were generated from the risk-standardized
mortality ratio (RSMR) defined as the ratio of predicted to expected mortality rates in the hospital. The
denominator adjusts for patient characteristics x only; in the numerator the predictive mortality model incorporates a

12

public reporting, they are based on the census of Medicare beneficiaries, while pricing is
observed for the privately insured. 8

To be sure we also conducted tests for endogeneity using a

predictive model for the underlying scores (observable to researchers). As expected we found
strong evidence for rejecting endogeneity. 9
The results from the familiar “naïve” models are used simply as a basis for comparison.
These models simply examine whether changes in the states that had report cards of their own
similar to Hospital Compare prior to 2008 exhibited less price sensitivity to HC rankings
compared with the intent-to-treat states, independently of any tradeoff between price and rating.
Finally, we also create a counterfactual to the full model, to test for the validity of the various
quasi-experiment designs above. The counterfactual is based on rerunning the models using noncardiac procedures that should be weakly susceptible to the information from Hospital Compare
with respect to pricing. Following Ryan, Nallamothu, and Dimick (2012) and Carey (2015), who
employ gastrointestinal diagnoses as the counterfactual for AMI when evaluating the mortality
consequences of HC initiation, we first employ surgeries for gastrointestinal cancers as the
random hospital-specific effect (α) that accounts for within-hospital correlations of the observed patient outcomes.
Accordingly, the excess mortality score is redefined as the ratio of predicted to expected mortality rate, with a
random effects term set equal to zero:

� 𝑅ℎ =
𝑅𝑆𝑀

𝐸(𝑦ℎ |𝑥ℎ ;𝛽,𝛼ℎ )

𝐸(𝑦ℎ |𝑥ℎ ;𝛽,𝛼ℎ =0)

Additionally, the underlying scores were constructed as 3-year moving averages with data drawn from Medicare
claims and administrative data. Note that Silber et al showed that hospital mortality scores are sensitive to model
specification. However, our interest is in the scoring as publically announced.
8

For Medicare patients price variation is minimal, since Medicare prices for all inpatient services are administered
and essentially set constant for general medical service and diagnosis categories, under the Inpatient Prospective
Payment System.

9

To test for such endogeneity, we performed the Durbin–Wu–Hausman test on the continuous mortality scores for
pneumonia, heart attack, and heart failure. The tests consist of saving the residuals from the first stage predictive
models as covariates in the pricing models. Hospital staffing variables such as nurses per bed, other full time
employees per bed, and log of beds as instrumental variables in the first stage estimates of mortality, we find that for
all three mortality outcomes in both CABG and PCI samples, the residuals from the first stage mortality regressions
were never statistically significant (p>0.10) in the second stage price regressions. Thus, we find no evidence of the
mortality scores being endogenous in our price regressions.

13

comparison to CABG and PCI. A primary example is surgery for colorectal cancer
(colectomy). ICD-9 and CPT codes needed to define colectomy related admissions are found in
a previous related study (Dor et al., 2012). Secondly, we examine the prices of gastrointestinal
hemorrhage cases, since this was one of the few principal diagnoses used in the AHRQ mortality
indicators but not adopted in Hospital Compare (but, later adopted by CMS in the HAC
Reduction Program; See AHRQ, 2015).10 We present the GMM estimates for colectomy and
gastrointestinal hemorrhage in Table 3. As expected, the HC public reporting does not impact
prices for these procedures.
An additional sensitivity analysis that allows for balancing samples in the control and
intervention state using propensity scores matching is provided in Appendix B. We find that the
results from the matched samples are similar to the results from the full sample analysis. Given
the matching estimates are less efficient, we focus on the latter.
Variable Specification
In its on-line rankings Hospital Compare reports separate mortality-based quality scores for heart
attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia, using the general categories labeled as above average, at
the national average, and below average in each. These rankings are based on 95 percent
confidence intervals for the deviation of actual relative to expected mortality rates, using risk
adjustment models described in Krumholz et al, 2006a, and 2006b. As a consequence few
hospitals were actually ranked below average, while the vast majority of hospitals were classified
as average (Table 1; also see Silber et al., 2010). To capture the incremental effect of higher

10

Beginning in 2015, the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program, mandated by the Affordable
Care Act, requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) to reduce hospital payments by 1 percent for
hospitals that rank among the lowest-performing 25 percent with regard to HACs.

14

quality in the pricing models we created binary indicators for the grouping of hospitals ranked
above average versus the grouping of all other hospitals, ranked average or less. We estimated
the impact of this variable separately for each of the two Hospital Compare conditions that
pertain to cardiac (heart attacks, chronic heart failure), and for a “combined” indicator which was
flagged if the hospital received above average rankings in all of the HC condition-specific
measures (heart attacks, chronic heart failure, pneumonia) during the year. We further estimated
separate models for CABG and PCI patients (summarized in Table 3).11 All models controlled
for patient demographics, clinical case complexity, HMO penetration rate, and hospital market
concentration (see Appendix Tables A.2-A.3 for the full specification).

IV.

Results

Tables 1 and 2 show the distribution of the raw prices and the Hospital Compare quality levels in
our data. Table 1 shows that prices for hospitals in the average and below average categories
were nearly equal, especially in the case of PCI, while price corresponding with the above
average category were substantially higher. Thus, prices generally increased as the HC quality
score improved. Table 2 adds the dimension of the comparison between the intent-to-treat states
(states with no cardiac report cards prior to HC) and the control group (states with reports prior
HC reporting). We observe that, overall, the treatment states experienced smaller increases in
CABG and PCI prices around the initiation of HC than the control states. This suggests that
simply introducing public reporting had a pro-competitive effect, exerting downward pressure on

11
In trial regressions we also ran specifications where the below average categories entered the equation separately
and results were essentially the same with respect to quality. For example, in a model based on the combined score
of all HC conditions which included binary indicators for both the above average and below average categories, the
premium for above average in CABG ($5,408 in Table 3) becomes $5,278 (p=0.099); there appears to be a below
average “penalty”, but it is not statistically significant (-$5,468, p=.39). Similarly, in the equivalent model for PCI,
the premium for above average is $965 (p=0.145) and the below average “penalty” is -$1,338 (p=.39).

15

hospital prices overall. However within the treated group price increases after the
implementation of Hospital Compare were substantially higher for hospitals in the aboveaverage category, suggesting that higher rankings would have been rewarded in the marketplace.
While these results are unadjusted and descriptive, they provide additional motivation for our
hypotheses about the impact of Hospital Compare. We proceed with full analysis below.
Table 3 summarizes the main GMM estimates for the policy variables for CABG and
PCI. The bi-level interaction terms for HC and no-report state represents the main program
effect in all models. The related coefficients were highly significant in all models, with price
reductions ranging from 8,054 to 9,854 for CABG, and 1,364 to 1,756 for PCI. The incremental
effect of the high quality ranking is captured by the triple interaction terms in the full DD
models; all of the related coefficients were positive. The variation in these coefficients was
substantial, with statistical significance found in the models which included the heart failure
mortality or the combined scores, while the corresponding coefficients in the heart attack models
were not significant. Taken together we interpret these results as indicating that high quality
hospitals were not penalized by the initiation of Hospital Compare and may have benefited from
a quality premium. We also note the coefficient of the binary Hospital Compare indicator was a
highly significant and consistent across all models, reflecting the general increase in CABG and
PCI prices between the pre HC and post HC period. Holding the program effects constant, there
were no significant differences between no-report states and control states, as would be expected
for valid controls.
The bottom panel of Table 3 summarizes coefficients of the counterfactual cases, namely
colectomy procedures and Gastrointestinal (GI) treatments. We would not expect to find a strong
effect of the cardiac-related HC measure on unrelated GI care and colon cancer surgery. This is

16

confirmed by the estimates. Indeed, none of the program coefficients were significant. 12 As
before, the HC coefficient for the pre-post comparison was significant, indicating an increase in
prices over the study period independently of the intervention.
In Table 4 the regression coefficients are extracted to demonstrate the overall pricereducing impact of Hospital Compare and the potential offsetting effect of being ranked in the
high-quality category (above average) category. 13 The first column reports prices for the baseline
case, in the states with no reports (intent-to-treat) in the non-reporting period. The baseline case
prices here are risk adjusted using the regression covariates and predicted for the baseline period.
As expected, CABG prices are substantially higher than PCI prices. The second and third
columns decompose the full policy effect. The second column reflects the change in price due to
the introduction of HC at the “typical” hospital with average or below average quality reported.
The third column reflects the combined effect of the policy and the premium for reporting high
quality.
The second column indicates that HC exerts downward pressure on prices ranging from 16.2% to -19.1% for CABG and -6.3% to -7.3% for PCI across all measures used. From the
third column we observe that in general, hospitals in the high quality bracket are able to
command higher prices relative to all other hospitals. For instance, in the case of CABG, the
second row implies that when the heart failure mortality measure is used, the full effect is 5.7% =
-19.1% + 24.8%, where 24.8% represents the quality premium. Note that in this case, the quality
premium more than offsets the downward pricing pressure exerted by the introduction of HC. A
similar finding is found for PCI. In both the CABG and PCI cases, for the heart attack measure,
12

For colectomy, the number of patients undergoing the procedure in our data was 4,955, and the mean price was
$21,690. For GI hemorrhage, there were 16,924 patients, with a mean price of $11,302.

The term a4*(E(Q|NR=1) -E(Q|NR=0)) in equation 4 ranged from $1 to $22 and was not statistically significant
in any of the models. Therefore it is omitted from the program effect calculations as reported in Table 4.

the quality effect dampens the downward pressure on prices due to HC, but does not fully offset

Discussion

Previous studies have shown limited impacts of hospital report cards on medical outcomes and
consumer choices, calling their value into question. Shifting the focus on hospital prices, the
results of this study increases confidence in the value of disseminating report cards while
alleviating concerns over markets potential failure to reward higher-performing hospitals. Our
results generally suggest that Hospital Compare, the premier source of publicly reported
information on hospital quality in the U.S., exerts competitive pressures on hospital pricing
contributing to lower prices. However, high quality hospitals were able to capture higher prices,
offsetting the effect of Hospital Compare initiation.
Our results have important implications for the future of health care reform. With the
implementation of Health Exchanges under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), hospital price
negotiations will likely intensify as more participants enter private markets. Despite the growing
need, information on pricing remains limited; and while hospital report cards are now accessible
to consumers, particularly in the case of cardiac procedures and diagnoses, little is known about
the impact of this information on prices ultimately paid by patients and plans.
In addition to recognizing the importance of providing quality information, policy makers
have identified a need to provide hospitals with financial incentives to induce delivery of higher
quality services to patients. Under revised payment rules now incorporated into the ACA, CMS
will adjust overall payments made to hospitals for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries
based on adherence to certain quality indicators (Value Based Purchasing). In private markets,

18

however, formal pay-for-performance rules for hospitals are less applicable, and compensation
for higher performance is left largely to market forces, through price differentials that are
renegotiated annually with insurers. This study suggests that quality report cards can inform and
influence hospital-insurer negotiations in the intended direction, thereby increasing consumer
welfare.

Appendix B: A test for misspecification error.
Two confounding effects due to treatment assignment may arise when estimating average
treatment effect on the treated (ATT), due to sample selection bias and group matching. While
selection bias is highly unlikely in our case (patients do not select their location based on which
states provided report cards) matching may be in issue both between groups and within groups
overtime. As a sensitivity test, here we rerun our difference-in-difference models subsetting to
samples that have been matched with propensity scores. In particular, in the CABG sample, we
match the 4,096 observations in the reporting states to 4,096 in the no reporting states using
nearest neighbor matching, without replacement and with common support. In the PCI sample,
we match 7,195 observations in the reporting states to 7,195 in the no reporting states. We use
the Stata program “psmatch2” to construct the propensity scores as the propensity to be a
reporting state, based on all the patient and market characteristics used in all our models (Leuven
and Sianesi, 2012). Comparing matching to no matching before the regressions, the bias is
reduced from 15.9 to 7.8 in the PCI model, and from 16.6 to 7.3 in the CABG model. The bias is
the difference of the sample means in the reporting and no reporting (full or matched) subsamples as a percentage of the square root of the average of the sample variances in the reporting
and no reporting groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985). Applying the GMM fixed effects
difference-in-difference estimators to the matched samples, we obtained the results shown in
Table B.1. These results do not differ much from the patterns found in the full sample results of
Table 3.
Note that Busso, DiNardo, and McCrary (2014) show that matching with propensity
scores is preferable to sample reweighting, however, propensity scores are sensitive to model
specification, and in our case is not clear which variables should account for common support,
e.g., patient level variables or all variables including hospital and market area characteristics
31

(Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2008; Leuven and Sianesi, 2012). To assess the potential bias more
generally we expand the expected value of the full DD estimate to include the vector of all such
variables.
Restating equation [4] we have:
Pihjt = a0 + a1 HCt + a2 NR ijt + a3 𝑄ℎ,𝑡−1 + 𝑎4 HCt ∗ NR ijt + a5 Qℎ,𝑡−1 ∗ NR ijt + a6 𝐻𝐶𝑡
∗ 𝑄ℎ,𝑡−1 + 𝑎7 ∗ 𝐻𝐶𝑡 ∗ 𝑁𝑅𝑖𝑗𝑡 ∗ 𝑄ℎ,𝑡−1 + a8 ∗ Zijt + eihjt

Under this model, the average impact of hospital compare is given by:

ΔHC = [E(P|nr, Post) − E(P|nr, Pre)] − [E(P|r, post) − E(P|r, pre)]

= ��𝑎0 + 𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + 𝑎3 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎4 + 𝑎5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎6 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)
+ 𝑎7 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎8 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)�
− �𝑎0 + 𝑎3 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒) + 𝑎5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒) + 𝑎8 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��
−��𝑎0 + 𝑎1 + 𝑎3 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎6 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎8 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)�
− �𝑎0 + 𝑎3 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒) + 𝑎8 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��

= 𝑎3 {[𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] − [𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)]} + 𝑎4
+ 𝑎5 [𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] + 𝑎6 [𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)]
+ 𝑎7 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)
+ 𝑎8 {[𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] − [𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)]}

Similarly, using equation 3 (Hospital Compare quality scores are not reported prior to HC
implementation), we have
ΔHC = ��𝛼0 + 𝛼1 + 𝛼2 + 𝛼3 + 𝛼4 ∗ 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼6 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)�
− �𝛼0 + 𝛼2 + 𝛼6 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��
−��𝛼0 + 𝛼1 + 𝑎4 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼6 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)� − �𝑎0 + 𝛼6 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��
= �𝛼1 + 𝛼3 + 𝛼4 ∗ 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼6 �𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��
−�𝛼1 + 𝛼4 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼6 �𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��

= 𝛼3 + 𝛼4 [𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)] + 𝛼5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)
+ 𝛼6 ��𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)� − �𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��
Thus, misspecification due to balancing would not be an issue if

[𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] − [𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] ≈ 0
32

Calculating this term in our data we get -263 for CABG and 754 for PCI in the full difference-indifference model for the combined heart failure/heart attack score. Taking account of this
component will not alter the basic empirical finding of a negative program effect (Table 4).
Moreover, from a two sided Z-test neither term was statistically different from zero (p=.95,
p=0.92 respectively).
