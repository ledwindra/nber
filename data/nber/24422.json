    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines long-term and heterogenous treatment effects of an experimental job-search assistance program that operated in Nevada from July through December 2009. Over the eight-year follow-up period, the program increased participants\u2019 employment and earnings, reduced short-term UI receipt, reduced loss of homeownership, and increased Federal tax filing and tax receipts. Related to heterogeneity, roughly 40 percent of the sample is estimated to have negative treatment effects on long-term employment which are corroborated by accompanying positive treatment effects on entry into disability insurance. Positive impacts on homeownership appear concentrated among individuals with positive employment treatment effects.\n\n",
