Unbalanced Trade

NBER Working Paper No. 13035
April 2007
JEL No. F17,F32,F41
ABSTRACT
We incorporate trade imbalances into a quantitative model of bilateral trade in manufactures, dividing
the world into forty countries. Fitting the model to 2004 data on GDP and bilateral trade we calculate
how relative wages, real wages, and welfare would differ in a counterfactual world with all current
accounts balancing. Our results indicate that closing the current accounts requires modest changes
in relative wages. The country with the largest deficit (the United States) needs its wage to fall by
around 10 percent relative to the country with the largest surplus (Japan). But the prevalence of nontraded
goods means that the real wage in Japan barely rises while the U.S. real wage falls by less than 1 percent.
The geographic barriers implied by the current pattern of trade are sufficiently asymmetric that large
bilateral deficits remain even after current accounts balance. The U.S. manufacturing trade deficit
with China falls to $65 billion from its 2004 level of $167 billion.

Theories of international trade typically assume trade balance. Yet any newspaper
reader knows that trade is far from balanced, a source of great unease among the citizens
of deficit countries. We incorporate imbalances into a quantitative model of trade flows
to calculate what relative wages, real wages, the manufacturing share of GDP, and the
pattern of bilateral trade would look like in a counterfactual world with all current accounts
balancing. While our exercise does not point to what policy would eliminate the imbalances,
it does suggest the magnitudes of the long-run adjustments that such a policy would entail.
We conduct our analysis using data for 2004 for the world, dividing it into forty “countries.”1 Table 1 lists the countries, their GDP’s and several diﬀerent external balance measures.2 The table begins with the broadest measure, the current account balance, followed
by the balance on goods and services, ending with the balance on manufactures.3 The
United States has by far the greatest current account imbalance, running a deficit of $664
1

We took the fifty largest, as measured by GDP in 2000, grouping all others into a “country” labeled

ROW. Due to poor data we moved Saudi Arabia, Poland, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Puerto Rico,
and the Czech Republic into ROW as well. To mitigate the eﬀect of entrepôt trade, which our approach
here is ill-equipped to handle, we have combined (1) Belgium, Luxembourg (which we pulled out of ROW),
and the Netherlands, (2) Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, and (3) China and Hong Kong
into single entities. The result is forty entities, which we henceforth refer to as countries, spanning the
globe.
2
Sources are as follows: GDP is from the World Bank (2006), the current account balance and balance
on goods and services are from IMF (2006), trade in manufactures (unilateral and bilateral) is from United
Nations Statistics Division (2006). The most recent bilateral trade data are for 2004; hence all of our
analysis is based on that year.
3
A well known statistical discrepancy results in nonzero current account balances and trade balances for
the world. For analytical reasons, we want to remove this discrepancy. Rather than force it all into ROW,
we instead attributed one fortieth of it to each country. Since we measure bilateral trade in manufactures
from the importer side, the trade balance of the world in manufactures is zero by construction.

billion or nearly 6 percent of its GDP.4 The countries with the largest current account
balances, Japan, Germany, and China (in that order), collectively run a surplus of $362
billion. For the largest players, the trade balance in manufactures is the main piece of the
overall current account. It’s the focus of our analysis here.
While unilateral imbalances command considerable attention, the U.S. obsession with
China’s trade suggests that bilateral trade imbalances are also a major concern. The last
two columns of Table 1 report each country’s bilateral trade surplus in manufactures with
the United States and with China. Note that the U.S. trade deficit with China is one third of
its total deficit in manufactures while China’s surplus with the United States is larger than
its overall trade surplus in manufactures. China is running a manufacturing trade deficit
with the world less the United States. Note in particular that China runs sizable deficits
with many of its neighbors in the Asia Pacific region. Its largest deficit is with Japan. The
United States runs deficits with most countries. Our analysis yields predictions about how
these bilateral imbalances would respond to an elimination of unilateral current account
imbalances.
Table 2 reports gross manufacturing exports and imports as well as the manufacturing
trade balance. It also indicates what the manufacturing trade surplus would have to be
in order to set current account balances to zero, holding fixed other components of the
current account. Note that by far the largest adjustment is required for the United States,
an increase in net exports of manufactures from a deficit of over $485 billion to a surplus
4

Among the deficit countries in 2004, the U.S. current account deficit is large even relative to GDP.

Only Australia, Greece, and Portugal have larger deficit to GDP ratios. Several small countries run current
account surpluses that are much larger fractions of their GDP’s, however. The Bureau of Economics
Analysis reports that the US current account deficit rose to $857 billion in 2006.

of $179 billion. The next largest adjustments are decreases in net manufacturing exports:
Japan’s and Germany’s surpluses each fall to just over $100 billion while China’s falls to
$36 billion. In this paper we explore the implications of achieving this particular set of
trade balances in manufactures.
Our methodology builds on a recent literature that integrates the gravity equation exhibited by bilateral trade flows into general equilibrium.5 This research provides a framework
for tracking the implications of various counterfactuals and policy experiments for diﬀerent
countries of the world, recognizing the role of trade barriers in fragmenting world markets.
We put such a model of bilateral trade to work to assess the counterfactual experiment
of simultaneously removing current account imbalances from each country. We examine
the resulting bilateral imbalances, relative wages, real wages, welfare, and manufacturing’s
share in these forty economies.
While our theoretical framework is one that has been used before in modeling bilateral
trade, we depart from a central feature of the gravity specification. The standard approach
has used sundry geographical, historical, linguistic, and political variables as indicators of
bilateral resistance to trade. Instead, we treat bilateral resistance for each country pair as
a parameter which we identify, in combination with other parameters of the model, directly
from current bilateral trade data, letting the bilateral trade flows speak for themselves.6

Contributions include Eaton and Kortum (2002), Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), Redding and

Venables (2004), and Chaney (2006).
6
Equation (15) in Eaton and Kortum (2002) provides a hint that one can go a long way without imposing
structure on trade costs. They show how the share of spending on domestic producers provides a simple
statistic for a country’s gains from trade. Furthermore Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003) show
that the bilateral trade matrix was a suﬃcient statistic for the matrix of trade costs in simulating a model
of individual producers in international competition. Recent work by Waugh (2007) pursues a related

3

A drawback of the standard approach for our analysis here is that the commonly used
indicators for bilateral resistance are typically symmetric, often with the implication that,
the error component aside, trade should balance bilaterally. By treating bilateral resistance
as a parameter that we infer from data we impose no structure, not even symmetry, on the
determinants of bilateral trade. China suggests a major deviation from symmetry with its
large manufacturing trade surplus with the relatively distant United States in combination
with its large deficits with its neighbors.
Our attempt to quantify the implications of eliminating current account deficits comes
with two important disclaimers. First, our exercise is pure comparative statics. We oﬀer
no explanation for why the current account deficits exist or what market response or policy
intervention would close them.7 We simply use current data to parameterize a static model
of bilateral trade flows and calculate the new equilibrium with zero deficits. We hope that at
some point our framework can be integrated into a dynamic model that incorporates capital
flows as well as flows of goods and services. Second, in focusing on trade in manufactures
we do not model trade in nonmanufactures. Since nonmanufactures include such diverse
items as soy beans, crude oil, hip hop, and patent royalties (for the last two, bilateral trade
data are limited anyway) we defer modeling their determinants for future work. For now
we simply treat each country’s nonmanufacturing trade deficit as a parameter that we take
from the data.
In this first respect our work resembles Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ (2005), who also employ a
static trade model to examine the implications of eliminating current account imbalances.
Focusing on real exchange rates and the terms of trade, they ignore real wages and welfare,
approach, in a model with capital accumulation, for assessing the contribution of trade to development.

Padamitriou et al. (2006) provide an excellent review of the debate about the causes and consequences
of the U.S. deficit.

which are central to our analysis. Furthermore their quantitative analysis employs a stylized
three-region model with much symmetry imposed. In contrast, our framework can grapple
with an arbitrary number of countries while capturing the asymmetries apparent in the
GDP and trade data. We thus capture much more tightly geographic features of the world.
Where comparable, our results are closest to what Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ call a “very gradual”
unwinding, or a decade-long adjustment.
While our framework can quite handily deal with a multitude of countries, its analytic
essence derives from the two-country model of trade and unilateral transfers of Dornbusch,
Fischer, and Samuelson (1977). We explore the connection between our analysis and this
earlier literature in the Appendix, showing how a marriage of our techniques and theirs
can deliver a sensible back-of-the envelope calculation about the implication removing a
transfer from the rest of the world to the United States.

1

World Equilibrium

Consider a world of N countries (with n denoting an importer and i an exporter), a continuum of diﬀerentiated goods, and a constant elasticity of substitution aggregator (with
parameter σ). Under these conditions, several theories of international trade lead to a
gravity equation of the form:
(1)

Ti (ci dni )−θ
π ni = PN
−θ
k=1 Tk (ck dnk )

where π ni is country i’s share in country n’s spending. Eaton and Kortum (2002) derive
such an expression (their equation (10)) from a Ricardian model in which Ti reflects the
absolute advantage of country i, ci the cost of inputs there, and dni ≥ 1 the additional
“iceberg” cost of delivering goods to n from i. The parameter θ, which in the Ricardian
5

model reflects comparative advantage, governs the sensitivity of demand to cost.8
We apply this equation to bilateral trade in manufactures among our forty countries.
Multiplying it by total spending on manufacturing in each country n, denoted by XnM , and
summing across the destinations i sells to, gives us the goods market clearing conditions:
(2)

YiM

=

N
X

π ni XnM ,

n=1

where YiM is country i’s gross production of manufactures.
If trade balances, as is often assumed, then XiM = YiM . Since our focus here is on the
yawning deficits and surpluses in manufactures, we don’t impose this condition. Instead we
simply acknowledge the deficits that we observe, DiM = XiM −YiM in our general-equilibrium
formulation.
To recognize (i) that manufactures are only one component of final expenditure and
(ii) that much of the gross output of manufactures goes into making manufactures we need
two additional parameters. We denote the share of final spending on manufactures as α
and the share of value added in manufacturing gross production as β. We are following
Alvarez and Lucas (2006) in treating final demand as an aggregate of manufactures and
nonmanufactures, with manufactures having a share α.
Denoting the price index of manufactures in country i as pi , we can rewrite (1) as:

β 1−β

k=1 Tk (wk pk dnk )

As Eaton and Kortum (2002) point out, equivalent formulations emerge under Armington assumptions,

as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), or monopolistic competition, as in Redding and Venables (2004).
In the first case Ti is the share of country i’s goods in preferences while in the second it is the number
of goods that country i produces. In either case, the parameter θ is replaced by σ − 1. Yet another
formulation follows from specifying a Pareto distribution, with parameter θ, in the model of Melitz (2003),
as in Chaney (2006).

We denote the total labor supply in country i as Li , which we treat as exogenous. Under
perfect competition final output, or GDP, is Yi = wi Li while final spending is Xi = Yi + Di ,
where Di is the overall trade deficit.9 To connect final spending with production and
spending on manufactures, we write total demand for manufactures by country i as the
sum of final and intermediate demand:
XiM = αXi + (1 − β)YiM = YiM + DiM .

Our analysis is consistent with an arbitrary number of factors as long as there are no systematic factor-

intensity diﬀerences between manufactures and nonmanufactures. In this case Li represents a (column)
vector of factor endowments and wi (when it multiplies Li ) a (row) vector of factor rewards or (when it
appears without Li ) as an index of factor rewards. In keeping with the Ricardian origins of our model we
nevertheless refer to the factor input as “labor” and its reward as the “wage.”

Taking as given (i) the trade imbalances Di and DiM , (ii) labor supplies Li , (iii) parameters of technology Ti , (iv) parameters of trade costs dni , and (v) parameters α, β, and
θ, an equilibrium is a set of wages wi and prices pi that satisfy (4) and (6), with π ni given
by (5).
We can resolve for the equilibrium under counterfactual trade imbalances, denoted Di0
and DiM0 . We denote the post adjustment value of any variable x as x0 and the change in
its value as x
b = x0 /x. The counterfactual wages and prices must satisfy the market clearing

We use equations (7) and (8) to solve for the changes in wages w

equilibrium under counterfactual assumptions about imbalances, using data on the original
8

values of GDP for the Y ’s and trade shares for the π’s. What’s neat about this representation is that, aside from GDP and bilateral trade data, we only need values for the three
parameters α, β, and θ.
It is straightforward, using Theorems 1, 2, and 3 of Alvarez and Lucas (2006), to prove
that there is a unique solution, vectors w
b and pb, to these equations, up to the normalization

i.e. world GDP Y is treated as the numeraire.
The particular exercise we conduct here is to ask what would happen if the manufacturing trade deficits had to adjust to set all current accounts to zero. That is, for each
country n we set:
DnM0 = DnM + CAn
where CAn is country n’s original current account surplus and DnM its original manufacturing trade deficit in 2004 (column 4 of Table 2 presents −DnM0 ).10 In our counterfactual, we
are fixing the values of the current account net of the manufacturing trade balance as well
as the trade balance on goods and service net of the manufacturing trade balance. What
that means is that these magnitudes are fixed as a fraction of world GDP.
10

In doing so, we set each country’s total counterfactual trade deficit to:
Dn0 = DnM0 + Dn − DnM .

Calibration and Computation

Aside from data on 2004 GDP’s (for the Y ’s) and on 2004 trade shares (for the π’s) to
stick in (7) and (8), we need values for the parameters θ, α, and β.
We set θ = 8.28 as estimated in Eaton and Kortum (2002) using price data. We also
consider the lower value of θ = 3.60 obtained in Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum
(2003).
We can calibrate α calculating for each country:
αn =

βYnM + DnM
V M + DnM
= n
,
Yn + Dn
Yn + Dn

where VnM is manufacturing value added (available for most of our countries from World
Development Indicators). We calculate the ratio of manufacturing value added plus the
trade deficit in manufactures to GDP plus the overall trade deficit on goods and services.
Averaging this ratio across countries in our sample (for which data on manufacturing value
added was available) yields α = 0.188.
Notice that β n = VnM /YnM . From United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(2006) we have data for many of our countries on both manufacturing value added and
manufacturing gross production. Averaging this ratio yields β = 0.312.
A simple iterative procedure provides the solution w
b and pb. With 40 countries, run-

ning this procedure in GAUSS on a good quality laptop, the solution is obtained almost
instantaneously.

For each country i = 1, . . . , 40, we present the change in a set of outcomes, presented as
the ratio of the counterfactual value to its original value. The wage change for country i is
simply w
bi itself, which also equals that country’s change in GDP. County i’s counterfactual

GDP is hence Yi0 = w
bi Yi . Since we also solve for pbi , we can express the change in the
10

real wage as (w
bi /b
pi )α . Taking into account the static gain or loss from setting the current

account to zero, we get the change in welfare in country i as

Results

Table 3 reports the changes to relative wages, real wages, and welfare that our exercise
claims are required to achieve the target manufacturing trade deficits reported in Table 2.
Note that these numbers imply less than a 5 percent increase in the wage for either China,
Germany, or Japan, the big surplus countries, and a 7 percent decline for the United States.
In other words, despite the large U.S. trade deficit, the results imply that achieving balance
is associated with a fairly modest 10 percent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative
to the currencies of the big surplus countries (assuming the adjustment takes the form of
an exchange rate realignment, holding wages fixed as expressed in the local currency).

11

The associated changes in the real wage, reported in column 2, are negligible for these
large countries. There are two reasons why the real wage eﬀects are so attenuated. For one
thing, the trade share data imply a huge “home bias” in manufacturing (that is, countries
spend a disproportionately large amount on domestically produced goods) so that domestic
manufactures, produced with local labor, dominate the manufacturing price index. For
another, with manufactures constituting less than twenty percent of final expenditure, the
nontraded sector dominates the overall price index.
The third column reports the change in real expenditure taking into account the change
in the deficit. Here the eﬀects are more pronounced, and largely dominated by the change
in the current account itself. Together the second and third columns indicate a small
“secondary burden” of adjusting current account deficits. Countries that must reduce their
deficits experience a lower real wage, so real expenditure falls by more than the drop in
transfers from abroad, with the opposite for countries that expand their deficits. But the
gain or loss of the transfer itself overwhelms the real wage adjustment in its eﬀect on
welfare.
We’ve solved for wages in the new equilibrium of a 40 country trading system. How
well could we have predicted each country’s wage change just from its own existing current
account? Figure 1 plots the wage change in Table 3 against the current account deficit in
Table 3 relative to GDP. The relationship is generally downward sloping but not monotonic.
While Algeria and Norway have smaller surpluses than Switzerland relative to their GDP,
they require a much larger wage increase due to their relative isolation. At the other
extreme Portugal runs a larger deficit than Australia but needs less of a wage decline to
adjust. The direction of the wage change is in accordance with the direction of the required
balance except for France, where the wage goes up slightly despite its current deficit.
12

A trade deficit in manufactures crowds out domestic manufacturing. Since our counterfactual experiment involves adjustments in manufacturing trade deficits, it has consequences for manufacturing’s share of production. The last column of Table 3 reports
the change in the manufacturing share of GDP resulting from the closing of the current
account deficit. The results indicate the largest increase in the United States, of 4.7 percentage points. The direction of the change is always predicted by the sign of the current
account surplus, with deficit countries needing to produce more and surplus countries less.
But the magnitudes are quite diﬀerent as a consequence of the changes in relative market
sizes implied by relative wage changes.
How does the overall adjustment get reflected in bilateral deficits for manufactures?
Table 4 reports the actual and counterfactual bilateral deficits for both the United States
and China with each other country. Note that the U.S. deficit with Japan and South
Korea virtually disappear while the U.S. deficit with Germany swings toward a significant
surplus. A large deficit with China nevertheless remains. At the same time China continues
to run large deficits with Korea and Japan. These varied responses reflect asymmetries in
the bilateral resistance measures indicated by current trade patterns. Projecting these
asymmetries into post-adjustment world still means that there is enormous room for large
bilateral imbalances even in a world with overall balance.
How much do our results depend on our choice of the parameter θ? Using the smaller
value of θ = 3.60 from BEJK (2003) implies that more wage adjustment is necessary (since,
in that case, trade shares are less responsive to wages). With this lower value, the U.S.
wage falls by 18 percent relative to the China’s and by about 20 percent relative to Japan’s
and Germany’s. Nevertheless the decline in the U.S. real wage barely exceeds 1 percent.

13

The implications for bilateral trade flows are nearly invariant to the choice of θ.11

4

Conclusion

We have asked what a static trade model has to say about the magnitudes of adjustments
needed to close current account imbalances as they stood in 2004. By assumption the
manufacturing sector bears the full burden of adjustment, which means that we are likely
providing an upper bound on the required changes there. Given our baseline parameters,
U.S. GDP must fall about seven percent relative to world GDP, while GDP in the major
surplus countries rises by two to four percent. With a smaller elasticity (meaning trade
shares are less responsive to costs), these adjustments are roughly doubled. In either case,
the decline in real wages in the United States is muted, around one percent, since most
goods can’t be traded and even those that could be are often purchased from domestic
producers in a large economy like the United States. According to our static analysis, the
main welfare cost of eliminating the current account deficit is simply the loss of the free
lunch, i.e. the loss of goods that we currently consume but do not pay for until later. That
cost is on the order of six percent of GDP.

11

Our analysis does not acknowledge any delay in the response to the counterfactual experiment that

we conduct. We have not introduced any frictions in getting from here to there. Ruhl (2005) provides
an explicit dynamic model to reconcile the observed short-run and long-run responsiveness of trade flows
to changes in policy. Our lower value of θ may better reflect a short-run response and the higher one a
long-run response.

A

A Two-Country Example

With just two countries our analysis collapses to a version of the two-country model of
trade and unilateral transfers of Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (DFS, 1977). We
show how that framework can be used to deliver a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the

16

wage adjustment required to achieve a zero current account between the United States and
the rest of the world.
Now the world consists of just two countries: the United States and ROW (denoted
with a *). As above there are a continuum of goods z ∈ [0, 1]. Labor endowments are L
and L∗ . Following DFS we assume Cobb-Douglas preferences. Following their notation the
productivity of labor in the United States relative to ROW is A(z) where the goods are
ordered so that A(z) is decreasing in z. Markets are perfectly competitive. We treat the
wage in ROW w∗ as the numeraire.
If the relative wage of the United States is ω = w/w∗ then the United States will
produce goods z ∈ [0, z] and ROW will produce the rest, where the threshold good satisfies
(9)

A(z) = ω.

To close the model we typically impose trade balance so that the value of US imports
I = (1 − z)wL equals the value of its exports E = zw∗ L∗ , or
(10) ω =

z L∗
.
1−z L

An equilibrium is a pair (ω, z) satisfying (9) and (10).
In fact, the same equilibrium arises if the United State runs a trade deficit, D = I − E.
Then spending by the United States is X = wL + D and spending by ROW is X ∗ =
w∗ L∗ − D. Goods market clearing requires
(1 − z)(wL + D) = z(w∗ L∗ − D) + D
which reduces to (10). The allocation of world production is determined by comparative
advantage and has nothing to do with which country is spending more or less. This case
captures the argument put forward by Ohlin.
17

This neutrality arises because we have not introduced any home-bias in expenditures
so what is transferred would have been spent the same way by transferrer and transferee.
Suppose instead that consumers in both countries allocate a fraction α of their spending
to tradable goods, with the rest spent on nontradables. Nontradables are produced with
local labor under constant returns.
The goods market clearing condition becomes
α(1 − z)(wL + D) = αz(w∗ L∗ − D) + D
or
z L∗
(1 − α)D
(11) ω =
+
.
1−z L
α(1 − z)w∗ L
An equilibrium pair (ω, z) now must satisfy (9) and (11). Relative to D = 0, a positive
deficit shifts up (11) for any given z, thus leading to an equilibrium with a higher US
relative wage ω and lower z. The intuition is that a positive deficit increases US spending
and hence spending on nontradables. To meet this extra demand US workers shift out of
the tradables sector and into the nontradables sector. As they do so, remaining workers
in the tradable sector specialize in producing a narrower range of products, for which US
relative productivity is higher. Thus, the relative wage of US workers goes up.
The share of US GDP originating in the tradables sector is
µ

L∗
λ=

.

ωL
Relative to the case of D = 0, this share is lower if D > 0. The deficit crowds out the
tradable sector.
What is less apparent in the model, yet perhaps more important, is what happens to
the US real wage. A small share of tradables α, which is a necessary condition for the
18

deficit to have large eﬀects on the relative wage, also implies a large share of spending on
goods whose price exactly parallels changes in the wage. Thus, real wage changes will arise
only through tradables. And, in a big country like the United States, even many tradable
goods are purchased locally. We now parameterize a version of the DFS model that renders
it the two-country version of the model considered in the main text.
The parameterized probabilistic formulation of the Ricardian model developed in Eaton
and Kortum (2002) projects onto a 2-country worlds as
µ ¶1/θ µ
¶1/θ
T

A(z) =

Hence, from (9) we have
z=

T ω −θ
.
T ω−θ + T ∗

Consider the equilibrium (ω, z) resulting from the current deficit of D, generating observed GDP’s of Y = wL and Y ∗ = w∗ L∗ . Under some counterfactual deficit D0 the
resulting equilibrium would be (ω0 , z 0 ). Letting ω
b = ω0 /ω, the counterfactual equilibrium
must satisfy

z =

and
(1 − z 0 )(Y ω
b + D0 ) = z 0 (Y ∗ − D0 ) + D0 /α.

Consider the counterfactual D0 = 0 so that the change in the relative wage satisfies

or

Using data for the United States in 2006 (in US$ trillions) we have Y = 13.2, Y ∗ = 33.9,
E = 1.4, I = 2.2, and D = 0.8.12 Furthermore, according to the model
E/(Y ∗ − D)
z
=
= 0.27
1−z
I/(Y + D)
(hence z = 0.21 and α = 0.2). Using the estimate of θ = 8.28 from Eaton and Kortum
(2002) we find ω
b = 0.96, approximately a 4% decline in the US relative wage. Using the
value of θ = 3.60 from BEJK (2003) yields ω
b = 0.92. In either case this change in relative

wages is largely cushioned by a change in prices so that the real wage in the United States
does not fall much.

To see the eﬀect on prices we need to take a stand on labor requirements in each country.
A natural specification consistent with our specification of A(z) is
a(z) = T −1/θ z 1/θ
and
a∗ (z) = T ∗−1/θ (1 − z)1/θ .
In the United States, the resulting prices of tradables are p(z) = wa(z) for z ≤ z and
p(z) = w∗ a∗ (z) for z ≥ z. Integrating over these prices, the exact price index for tradables
in the United States (given Cobb-Douglas preferences) is

12

£
¤−1/θ
p = e−1/θ T w−θ + T ∗ w∗−θ
.

These numbers are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis except for GDP in ROW which was taken

from World Bank (2006), assuming that world GDP grew at the same rate as US GDP from 2005 to 2006.

20

Letting the counterfactual price index be p0 and pb = p0 /p, we get
i−1/θ
h
ω −θ + (1 − z)
.
pb = zb

Taking into account non-tradables, the change in the real wage is (b
ω /b
p)α . The U.S. real
wage declines by a bit less than 1 percent for θ = 8.28 and a bit more than 1 percent for
θ = 3.60. In either case, the tradables sector share of GDP rises 3 percentage points.
