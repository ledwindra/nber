    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine the introduction of automatic air pollution monitoring, which is a central feature of China\u2019s \u201cwar on pollution.\u201d Exploiting 654 regression discontinuity designs based on city-level variation in the day that monitoring was automated, we find that reported PM\u2081\u2080 concentrations increased by 35% immediately post\u2013automation and were sustained. City-level variation in underreporting is negatively correlated with income per capita and positively correlated with true pre-automation PM\u2081\u2080 concentrations. Further, automation\u2019s introduction increased online searches for face masks and air filters, suggesting that the biased and imperfect pre-automation information imposed welfare costs by leading to suboptimal purchases of protective goods.\n\n",
