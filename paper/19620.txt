ABSTRACT
At political boundaries, local leaders often have weak incentives to reduce polluting activity because
the social costs are borne by downstream neighbors. This paper exploits a natural experiment set in
China in which the central government changed the local political promotion criteria and hence incentivized
local officials to reduce border pollution along specific criteria. Using a difference in difference approach,
we document evidence of pollution progress with respect to targeted criteria at river boundaries. Other
indicators of water quality, not targeted by the central government, do not improve after the regime
shift. Using data on the economic geography of key industrial water polluters, we explore possible
mechanisms.

Introduction

River pollution represents a classic negative externality that spills across political
boundaries. The source region generates emissions that pollute the river but most of these
social costs are borne downstream. The affected region bears the costs of pollution but
enjoys few or none of the benefits of polluting. In cases ranging from Western Europe to
China the result has been high levels of water pollution at political boundaries (Cai et al.,
2013; Sigman 2002, 2005; Sandler 2006). The empirical literature on transboundary
river pollution documents a significant free-riding effect along inter-jurisdictional rivers.1
Coasian bargaining offers one pathway for mitigating externalities. However, in
China it is prevented by the absence of a regional negotiations mechanism. 2 A second
way for free riding to cease at river boundaries is for local officials to be motivated to
take costly actions to mitigate pollution. In China, the central government has recently
provided strong incentives for local officials to take costly actions.

1

Sigman (2002) compares pollution in domestic and international rivers. She finds that stations
immediately upstream of international borders have higher levels of BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)
than similar stations elsewhere. Gray and Shadbegian (2004) find different effects on air and water
pollution of being near the Canadian-United States border. On the water pollution side they observe more
BOD discharges and fewer inspections near the border. Using toxics release inventory data from 1987 to
1996, Helland and Whitford (2003) show that facilities’ emissions into the water are systematically higher
in counties that border other states. Sigman (2005) finds that free riding gives rise to a 4% degradation of
water quality downstream of authorized US states, with an annual environmental cost downstream of 17
million US dollar. In China, Cai et al. (2013) document that water-polluting production activities are
approximately 30 percent greater in the most downstream county of a province.
2
The local governments in China are independently authorized by the central government. Generally, the
multiregional affairs are coordinated by the central government. In Chinese political culture, regional
negotiation is not encouraged since it weakens the governance of the central government. The riparian
provinces usually competed with each other to seek resolutions from the central government rather than
dialogue and cooperation with other provinces (Tyler, 2006).

2

In this paper, we investigate how China’s central government’s regime shift in
evaluating local officials for promotion affected water pollution dynamics. China’s rivers
cut across political jurisdictions. We document that at the baseline there is evidence of
free riding. In 2005, the central government changed the rules of the game and provided
local officials with strong incentives to reduce specific indicators of water pollution along
rivers that flow within. For local officials, who sought to be promoted within the Chinese
political promotion system, compliance with these new environmental targets motivated
them to cease free riding at boundaries.
We document evidence supporting this claim based on a difference in difference
approach using pollution data from 499 stations located in China’s major seven rivers
during the years 2004 to 2010. We find that the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand)
decreases significantly starting in 2005 when China’s central government started to tie
officials’ promotion chances to this indicator of environmental quality. Furthermore, the
COD measures at the province boundary stations decrease faster than at stations located
inside the province. We test for the association between urban leader’s attributes and
indicators of pollution abatement effort at boundaries. We posit that younger governors
have greater career concerns because of their longer future planning horizon.
Such water pollutants as petroleum, lead, mercury, and phenol are more harmful
than COD for public health. Unlike in the case of COD, these water pollution measures
do not decline more at the transboundary stations. This is relevant because these criteria
were not chosen to be part of the objective performance criteria for evaluating the
effectiveness of local officials. Thus, local officials with career concerns had no
incentives to seek to improve their location’s pollution based on these criteria.

3

The paper’s final empirical contribution is to explore the mechanisms through
which the COD progress might be taking place. The pulp and paper industry is the major
COD producer. Using plant level industrial data, we explore the economic geography of
this industry relative to the location of rivers.

Since the implementation of the target

based environmental policy, new pulp and paper firms are less likely to be locating close
to rivers.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses relevant
points about China’s river geography. Section 3 describes some features of China’s
recent environmental protection efforts. Section 4 presents a model to convey the spatial
free rider problem. Our empirical strategy and our data are described in Section 5.
Section 6 discusses our findings. Section 7 offers insights about how urban officials may
use their power to achieve pollution improvements. Section 8 concludes.

2. The Geography of China’s Major Rivers

All ancient civilizations flourished in the river basin. They are nurtured by rivers,
since rivers, as a natural resource, have been used as a source of water, for obtaining food,
for transport, as a source of power, and as a means of disposing of waste. Chinese
civilization originated in various regional centers along both the Yellow River and the
Yangtze River valleys in the Neolithic era, and the Yellow River is said to be the cradle
of Chinese civilization. Even today most of Chinese major cities locate along rivers. The
basins of China’s seven major river systems occupy 44% of the nation’s total territory

4

and serves 88% country’s population (World Bank, 2007). 3 Among them, the Yangtze
River and the Yellow River are the third-longest and sixth-longest river in the world.
Our research focuses on ten river systems listed in China Environmental
Yearbooks. Besides the seven major river systems, our sample also includes three
regional river systems in southeast, southwest and northwest China. These river systems
are all cross-provincial and managed by the China central government. It sited many
monitoring stations along these rivers and monitors the hydrological attributes and water
pollution. The pollution data in our sample are generated from these monitoring stations.
To measure the increasingly serious river pollution, China’s central government
invested in a significant expansion of its monitoring station system in 2004. Many new
stations were built and started to provide data. Our sample collects the pollution data
from 499 monitoring stations from 2004 to 2010 as shown in Figure 1.
[Insert Figure 1 about Here]
As shown in Figure 2, cross-provincial rivers connect several different
jurisdictions together. Upstream regions often locate polluting enterprises close to the
border, so the river’s discharge is carried into downstream regions. The average COD
level reported at these provincial boundary stations is 10.49 mg/L in 2005. This average
is much higher than the 7.04mg/L average reading from stations located within the
territory of a single province.
[Insert Figure 2 about Here]
To better monitor the water quality in China’s rivers, the central government sites
monitoring stations both inside the province and at the borders of the two provinces. The

River, and Pearl River.

types of monitoring stations are shown in Figure 2 with different marks. In our sample,
127 monitoring stations are located at the provincial boundary out of 499 total stations.

The Water Pollution Policy Regime Shift

China’s pollution challenges are well known (see Zheng and Kahn 2013). For
decades, the powerful central government has prioritized economic growth to raise the
nation’s material wellbeing. Hundreds of millions of people have exited poverty but
extreme environmental degradation has taken place as China has relied on an
industrialization growth strategy and relying on coal for power generation and heating
(Vennemo et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2013).
The nation’s high pollution is also related to its unique management and political
system. China runs a target-based vertical control system, where the central government
ranks local governors’ performance and then decides the promotion of local governor
directly (Xu, 2011). This evaluation system had traditionally placed heavy emphasis on
economic growth statistics (Li and Zhou, 2005).

Such incentives discourage local

governors from enforcing environmental regulations (Jia, 2013). Local governors also
tend to have a short term perspective focused on economic growth, over long term green
goals, because they expect that their tenure as governors will be short as they advance in
the hierarchy. As a result of this incentive system, local officials have sought to attract
high polluting factories to their area.

Public health research has documented that

industrial pollution has caused severe health problems such as “cancer villages”
(Ebenstein, 2012).
6

Facing this critical situation, China’s central government has taken steps to
mitigate pollution externalities (Landry 2008; Zheng and Kahn, 2013; Zheng et al., 2013).
The essence of the new implemented environmental policy is to tie the discharges of
major pollutants with the promotion of local governors.

In this sense, the central

government is explicitly acknowledging the principal-agent problem that it does not fully
observe local officials’ efforts to reduce pollution.
The implementation of the new environmental policy had two stages. First, the
outline of the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) in 2005 announced the binding target that
national COD and sulfur dioxide discharges must decline. To encourage localities to
comply with the national policy, the central government announced that it would impose
administrative demerits or removal from office for leaders at sub-national level who
failed to meet the pollution targets.

The 11th FYP set environmental targets as a

mandatory requirement for local governments and provided no wiggle room for poor
performance on these environmental criteria.
To ensure the effectiveness of its chosen policies across China’s territorial
administration, in 2007, the central government announced that the COD and sulfur
dioxide reduction targets had to be attained by the end of 2010 and should be
incorporated into the responsibility contracts signed with local governments at various
levels. More importantly, the central government announced that local official
performance with respect to the COD and sulfur dioxide reduction would outweigh all
other achievements of the local governors. 4 Local governors therefore have been
incentivized to meet these emissions targets.

4

All provinces reached this green goal by the end of 2010.

7

When China’s central government shifted its environment policy, it also paid
special attention to the transboundary pollution to try to limit free-riding.5 The central
government emphasized that upstream regions are also required to take responsibility
with respect to the pollution experienced in downstream regions. The central government
also authorized the downstream provinces to report the source regions to the central
government in the event of poor water quality.6

An Analysis of Local Official’s Response to the Policy Regime Shift

China’s central government sets an environmental target and encourages local
governors to achieve it under the new environmental policy regime. China’s new
environmental policy links the promotion probability of local governors to pollution
levels. The local governors cannot be promoted if they fail to achieve the target but the
local governors’ promotion chances are still tied to total output produced. Upstream
regions also consider the pollution level in the downstream regions. Once the station in
the downstream region fails to achieve the target given by central government, the
upstream region’s leader also cannot be promoted.
Under this new policy regime, local governors are aware that they face a
significant challenge in reducing transboundary pollution because they cannot costlessly
5

China’s water pollution problems easily can transcend the provincial boundaries. The severe
transboundary water pollution incidents occurring one after another in recent years are a striking reflection
of the problem. In November 2005 a spill of toxic chemicals poisoned the Songhua River, the largest
tributary of Amur. As an estimated 100 tons of benzene, aniline and nitrobenzene entered the Songhua
River, several Chinese and Russian cities downstream from the spill were forced to shut off their water
supplies

contract with their neighboring local governor.7 The optimal strategy of local governors
is to increase effort and reduce pollution activity more at borders because of their
uncertainty about their neighbors’ effort. The net effect of this policy is to encourage the
local officials to work together and cease the free-riding effects at provincial boundaries.
We present a simple analysis to show the underlying logic how the new pollution
control policies in China discourage free-riding at transboundary borders. As shown in
Figure 3, we discuss a river crosses the border of two provinces, and there are two
monitoring stations within the province and one station at the border. To simplify our
model, we assume that three industry parks are located near the monitoring stations. The
local governors locate dirty industry into different parks; and the different parts of the
river will be polluted by the dirty industry close to them.
The pollution level of each station is decided by the dirty industry in the neighbor
industry park, and also impacted by the upstream. We assume that the water is clean
before it comes to station 1. The pollution level at station 1 is

where

is the total dirty industry in industry park 1. Assume the distance between each

station is ; and the decay rate of pollution is . The pollution level of station 2 is

Promotion is a competition among local leaders. Coordination between competitors is difficult.

9

Before the new environmental policy is implemented in China, Province A will
locate more dirty industry in industry park 2, i.e. the border of two provinces. The
upstream region free rides downstream. Recent empirical work supports this claim (Cai,
Chen and Qing 2013).
The central government requires the pollution level of each station reduces to
the initial level and

of

after a fixed period under new policy regime.8 Local governors

can either invest in new technology or reduce the dirty industry’s scale of production in
order to meet the environmental target. To simplify, we assume that the technology is
constant and governors improve environmental quality through reducing the scale of dirty
industry production.9 The local governors can choose between three strategies. They can
reduce their dirty industry to

proportion of the initial level; or a bit higher than ,

of the initial industry level; or a bit lower than ,

of the initial industry level. The

local governor faces a tradeoff over the scale of the dirty industry. Such industry raises
total output. However, the pollution from the dirty industry will make them more likely to
fail to achieve the environmental target; and this will hurt their career prospects.
At station 1, the optimal strategy of local governor is to reduce the dirty industry
in industry park 1 to

We also can discuss that local governors reduce pollutants discharge through improving technology. The
results are as same as above discussion. Local governors will invest more on the industry at the province
border.

At station 2, if the local governor of province A reduces the dirty industry to , he
can achieve the environmental target at station 2. But since the behavior of local governor
in province B is uncertain. If he/she locates a bit more dirty industry in industry park 3,
perhaps the local leader in province A will fail to be promoted. The local governor in
province A will choose a lower dirty industry

in the boundary. Lower dirty

industry gives governor a greater likelihood to achieve the environment target at stations
2 and 3, although it reduces the output and the probability of promotion slightly. Overall,
the pollution level at station 2 is

Comparing equation (1), (2), (4) and (5), pollution at the boundary monitoring
stations declines in absolute and relative terms.

Data and Empirical Strategy

The water pollution datasets used in our analysis are obtained from the China
Environmental Yearbooks published in various years. Our sample covers eight water
quality indicators at 499 stations between 2004 and 2010 with a sample size of 3,377
individual observations. It is an unbalanced panel sample since some stations do not
report data in certain years. However, the missing observations are rare, representing less
than 3% of the sample. They are Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical
Oxygen Demand (BOD), and the densities of Oxygen (DO), Hydronitrogen (NH),
petroleum, lead, mercury, and phenol, respectively. All of these eight water pollutants
11

capture general forms of anthropogenic pollution and could travel reasonably far
downstream causing significant spillovers at many monitoring stations on domestic rivers.
Data quality is a major concern in China environmental studies.10 The statistical
data is often manipulated by China authorities since the data is related to the performance
evaluations of local governments (Chen et al., 2013). Our study avoids these issues. First,
the monitoring stations in our sample are all run by the central government. Local
governments have limited influences on these stations. Second, our paper focuses on the
difference between stations within the province and at the boundary. There is no
motivation for the central government to only modify the data of one specific category of
stations.
The additional explanatory variable included in our study is the city’s GDP level.
These data are from the China Statistical Yearbook for Regional Economy published in
various years. Summary statistics of the water pollution indicators and control variables
are presented in Table 1.
[Insert Table 1 about Here]
This paper investigates transboundary water pollution dynamics as a function of
centralized environmental policy. For each type of pollution, we estimate a multivariate
regression of the form

10

In most of the papers discussing China’s water pollution, water quality data are either directly collected
from the local/national monitoring stations (e.g., Yin et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008) or collected via field
work (e.g., Ma et al., 2009). Using Shenzhen as a case, Wang et al. (2004) show that satellite image data
after calibration and correction for atmospheric effects can serve as another means of estimating water
quality.

can be interpreted as a difference in difference estimate (Meyer, 1995) that

captures annual change (compared to the base year 2004) in water pollutant discharges in
a boundary station relative to similar stations elsewhere.
As we discussed earlier, China’s recent environmental responsibility scheme is
the key tool that the central authorities use to incentivize local officials to achieve green
goals of concerns. However, it does not mean that all local governors will be induced to
exert effort and resources in ways commensurate with the preferences of the central
government. Since meeting the green goal raises the local leader’s career prospects, those
who are young should be more enthusiastic about attaining the green target laid down by
the central government.
Since the Decision to Build a Retiring Scheme for Senior Cadres (1982) ruled out
reappointment of civil servants after the age of 65, age has become a critical variable
determining turnover (Li and Zhou, 2009). To maintain position stability of leadership
term, the Temporary Regulations on Terms of Cadre of China Communist Party and
Government (2006) further regulated that each term of provincial governors and Party

secretaries should not be longer than 5 years. These norms serve as powerful tools to
guarantee the relatively young leaders reach leadership positions. Thus, when a leader
approaches the age of 60, the chances of promotion diminishes quickly even if he/she is
capable. We hypothesize that young local leaders are more eager to fulfill the COD
discharges cut target since they have a longer career horizon. We posit that border
pollution will fall much faster if both sides of the border are led by younger governors.
To test this leaders hypothesis, we collect detailed biographical information on
chief governors and chief provincial party secretaries, from several publicly accessible
sources including the internet services China Vitae13 and individual biographies. The data
allow us to establish the month and year in which they were born and took/left office.
We divide the provincial leaders by age into two groups, “young” (60 or less) and
“old” (over 60).14 Then we partition all transboundary stations in our sample into three
subsamples based on the above information. In group A, the provincial leaders on both
sides are “young”. In group B, at least one of the provincial leaders on each side is “old”
(or “young”). In group C, both provincial leaders of the neighboring provinces are “old”.
We then can capture the promotion effect by examining and comparing the coefficients
for the year dummies specified in the following equation.
(7)
It is expected that other things being equal, the year dummy coefficient of group A
should exceed that of group C in absolute terms.

In our sample the average age of a governor is 57.6 years and that of a party secretary 58.6.

Empirical Results

This section presents our results testing the free riding hypothesis as we examine
water pollution dynamics at boundary monitoring stations after the 2005 environmental
policy shift. Since the promotion criteria only target COD pollution, we posit that only
this criterion should improve while others should not be affected.
Table 2 summarizes our key results for COD. We report two estimates of equation
(6). Our benchmark regression is displayed in Column 1, and the subsequent columns
provide robustness checks when extra control variables are included. As expected, in
column 1 of Table 2, the coefficients of the interaction terms (defined as year dummies
multiplied by the indicator of whether the station is at a boundary) are all negative and
large in absolute value.

These interaction terms only become statistically significant

after the year of 2006. The magnitude of the interaction terms increase in every year
except for 2007.
[Insert Table 2 about Here]
As shown in Table 2’s column (2) both economic growth and per capita income
are estimated to increase COD concentrations.15
In our next set of results, we report placebo regressions where we focus on other
measures of water pollution, some of which are more important to public health than
COD that the government chose not to use as performance criteria.16 Table 3 reports the
results when the dependent variable is represented in turn by the other seven measures of

water pollution. The coefficients of the interaction terms are never negative and
statistically significant and in one case the coefficients are positive and statistically
significant. This indicates (in the case of DO) that water pollution on this criteria
increased at the boundary station over time. Judging from Table 3 it appears that China’s
recent environmental target-based responsibility scheme only promotes good neighbor
behavior in the COD case no matter how harmful other pollutants might be for human
health and ecosystem.
[Insert Table 3 about Here]
As we discussed above, younger local officials have the greatest career concerns.
In Table 4, we test for differential water pollution progress as a function of local officials’
attributes. As expected, compared with other cases, if leaders on both sides of the
boundary are “young”, the COD concentrations in the transboundary sites were more
quickly reduced.17 As shown in Table 4, achieving the green goal mattered more for the
political fortunes of Party secretaries but not those of governors. These results suggest
that performance-based rewarding or punishment is actually a feasible tool to promote
interest alignment between central and local leaders.

Exploring the Mechanisms: The Location of Pulp and Paper Plants

17

Note that although both provincial Party secretaries and governors are evaluated, it is primarily the
leading cadres (i.e., Party secretaries) who are more affected by the environmental target-based
responsibility system.

16

Local governors can influence the location and scale of dirty industry production
through using their administration power. They can shut down and move away the dirty
industry to improve environmental quality.
In China, local governments have a monopoly on land development and the power to
zone land to decide what industrial activity goes where. For example, to encourage ecoindustrial initiatives, China initiated the pilot construction of Eco-Industrial Parks in 2001
and established the Standard for Sector-Integrate Eco-Industrial Parks (SSEP) in 2009.
According to the SSEP, industrial value added per unit of COD discharged within the
EIPs must not exceed 1 kg/Yuan (the national average in 2009 is 3.26 kg/Yuan).18
COD, the target pollutant set by China central government, is mainly discharged
due to industrial production. The pulp and paper industry is responsible for a very large
share of total industrial COD emissions (see Laplante and Rilstone, 1996; Gray and
Shadbegian, 1998). Using data from 2004 to 2008 from the China Statistical Yearbook
and the China Environmental Statistical Yearbook, in Figure 4 we plot each industry’s
share of total industrial COD emissions on the vertical axis and the industry’s share of
total industrial output on the horizontal axis. The pulp and paper industry stands out as
an enormous outlier. While its share of output is roughly 2.5% it produces 32.6% of total
industry COD. Given this fact, we focus on the economic geography of where these
plants cluster over time.19

official document from China’s government.
19
Paper production can be divided into five major manufacturing steps: 1. pulp production, 2. pulp
processing and chemical recovery, 3. pulp bleaching, 4. stock preparation and 5. paper manufacturing. All
of these steps require a large volume of water. After the pulping stage is complete, residual matter remains
which are usually released directly into rivers. Production costs are higher if a pulp & paper firm is further
from a river where it is required to meet tougher emission standards, install higher-capacity (more
expensive) pollution control equipment, incur higher operating costs, and perform more frequent
maintenance. In China, many of the thousands of pulp mills are located in regions close to forests. These

17

[Insert Figure 4 about Here]
Using data from the China Annual Survey of Industrial Firm 2005-2008, we
identify the new pulp and paper plants each year and calculate the distance (Measured by
Kilometer) between them and the nearest river monitoring station. We divide all plants
into two groups. One group includes the new pulp and paper plants that opened between
2003 and 2005 when the central government had not implement the new environmental
policy while the other group includes the new pulp and paper plants opened between
2006 and 2008 when the policy is implemented.
Figure 5 shows the kernel density function of each set of pulp and paper plants’
distance to the nearest provincial boundary monitoring station. Most of the new pulp and
paper plants from 2006 to 2008 located further from the boundary station. Figure 6
shows the kernel density of pulp and paper plants’ distance to the nearest non-provincial
boundary monitoring station of both groups. The figure shows the locations of pulp and
paper plants relative to non-boundary station have similar trend before and after the
implementation of environmental policy. Together, these figures highlight that new pulp
and paper plants are locating further from the provincial border while within provinces
there are no discernible migration patterns for this polluting industry.
[Insert Figure 5&6 about Here]
We recognize that pulp and paper plants may differ with respect to their scale of
operations. Local officials concerned about pollution impacts should care more about
larger plants. In results available on request, we find that the employment weighted nonparametric kernel distributions look quite similar to the unweighted distributions

regions are also punctuated by numerous large rivers, which can be tapped to provide the sizable energy
needed to grind timber into pulp and paper

18

presented in Figures 5 and 6. The new pulp and paper plants locate significantly further
away from the boundary stations during the 2006 to 2008 period. This suggests that the
local governors put more effort in reducing the boundary pollution under China
centralized environmental policy as they restrict pulp and paper plants from locating
close to the boundary.

Conclusion

Free riding at political boundaries causes significant social costs for people who
live on the other side of the boundary.

This paper has studied how changes in the

performance criteria used for evaluating Chinese government officials incentivized them
to exert effort to reduce pollution externalities.
China’s recent environmental target responsibility system creates new rules of the
game that incentivize local governors to increase their effort to reduce water pollution at
political boundaries. Those local governors who seek to rise in the government’s power
structure recognize that high pollution levels will reduce their promotion chances.
We find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that local governors have
responded to the new promotion rules by taking more effort to reduce water pollution at
political boundaries. 20 Our study also points out a fault of the current system. Local
governors focus on the environmental measures set by central government rather than a
broader set of water criteria that might be more relevant for public health (see Tables 2

The central government cannot distinguish between the sources of transboundary pollution, and will thus

and 3). In a principal-agent model, the agent will focus on those criteria that he knows he
is being evaluated on and will tend to shirk on other output targets (Holmstrom and
Milgrom 1991). Future research should investigate the local quality of life impacts and
the economic incidence of these pollution reductions.
