ABSTRACT
We study bilateral exchange, both direct trade and indirect trade that happens through chains of intermediaries
or middlemen. We develop a model of this activity and present applications. This illustrates how, and
how many, intermediaries get involved, and how the terms of trade are determined. We show how
bargaining with one intermediary depends on upcoming negotiations with downstream intermediaries,
leading to holdup problems. We discuss the roles of buyers and sellers in bilateral exchanges, and
how to interpret prices. We develop a particular bargaining solution and relate it to other solutions.
In addition to contrasting our framework with other models of middlemen, we discuss the connection
to different branches of search theory. We also illustrate how bubbles can emerge in intermediation.

Introduction

We study bilateral exchange, both direct trade, and indirect trade that happens through
intermediaries, or middlemen. We develop a model of this activity and present several applications. The framework illustrates how, and how many, middlemen might get involved.
Although there is much economic research on the topic, a neglected aspect that seems important to business practitioners is that there are often multiple middlemen engaged in getting
goods from the originator to end user — e.g., from farmer to broker to distributor to retailer
to consumer.1 A feature we emphasize is that the terms of trade one might negotiate with an
intermediary depend on upcoming negotiations with the second, third and other downstream
intermediaries. We call this bargaining with bargainers. We also have something to say about
the roles of buyers and sellers — in particular, which are which — in bilateral exchange, and
about the interpretation of prices. We develop a particular bargaining solution and discuss
how it relates to other solutions. Additionally, we illustrate how bubbles can emerge in the
value of inventories as they get traded across intermediaries.
In terms of related work, it was not so long ago that Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1987),
hereafter RW, motivated their study as follows:
Despite the important role played by intermediation in most markets, it is largely
ignored by the standard theoretical literature. This is because a study of intermediation requires a basic model that describes explicitly the trade frictions that
give rise to the function of intermediation. But this is missing from the standard
market models, where the actual process of trading is left unmodeled.
1

As a special case of this example, taken from Cooke (2000), consider illegal drugs. As another example,
Ellis (2009) describes the internet like this: “If a majority of the wholesale companies being advertised are
not true wholesale companies, then what are they and where are they getting their products? They are
likely just middleman operating within a chain of middleman. A middleman chain occurs when a business
purchases its resale products from one wholesale company, who in turn purchases the products from another
wholesale company, which may also purchase the products from yet another wholesale company, and so on.”

Subsequent studies attempt to rectify the situation by analyzing how middlemen aﬀect
the quality of matches, the time required to conduct transactions, the variety of goods on
the market, bid-ask spreads, and other phenomena. RW themselves focus on search frictions,
and for them, middlemen are agents who have an advantage over the original suppliers in the
rate at which they meet buyers. Focusing instead on information frictions, Biglaiser (1993)
and Li (1998,1999) present models where middlemen are agents with expertise that allows
them to distinguish high- from low-quality goods, and show how the presence of informed
intermediaries helps to ameliorate lemons problems. In other papers (Camera 2001, Johri
and Leach 2002, Shevchenko 2004, Smith 2004 and Watanabe 2010a,b), middlemen hold
inventories of either more, or more types of, commodities that help buyers obtain their
preferred goods more easily.2
In general, middlemen may either hold inventories, or act as market makers whose role
is to get traders together, without buying and selling themselves (Yavas 1992, 1994, 1996;
Gehrig 1993). Models of these activities in financial markets include Duﬃe, Garleanu and
Pedersen (2005), Miao (2006), Weill (2007), Lagos and Rocheteau (2009) and Lagos, Rocheteau and Weill (2009). Many of these applications can be considered part of the New
Monetarist economics surveyed by Nosal and Rocheteau (2010) and Williamson and Wright
(2010a,b), defined by an endeavor to explicitly model the exchange process, and institutions
that facilitate this process, including money, intermediaries, etc.. We say more later about
the relationship between intermediation and money; for now we mention that early searchbased models of money like Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) not only make predictions about
which objects emerge as media of exchange, as a function of their properties and of beliefs,
they can also be used to think about which agents might act as middlemen.
Search theory is the right tool for analyzing intermediaries and related institutions because, as RW suggest, it models exchange explicitly. In a sense, this study is as much about
search theory as it is about the substantive topic of middlemen. We set up our environment
diﬀerently, in several ways, from previous studies. This is because we are less interested in

(2007, 2008), Tse (2009) and Bose and Sengupta (2010).

why middlemen have a role, in the sense that much of the analysis involves circumstances
where trade must be intermediated. Instead, we focus on equilibrium exchange patterns
with potentially long chains of intermediation, and the determination of the terms of trade
along these chains.3 Still, for comparison, we present a version that generalizes RW. More
ambitiously, we not only compare our framework with other models of middlemen, we also
discuss the connection to other branches of search theory, and show how some ostensibly
diﬀerent models can be interpreted in one light. This leads to several questions about models
of bilateral trade — including, who is the buyer and who is the seller, and what is the price?
In terms of price determination, we focus on a particular bargaining solution that we think
is attractive, but also give results for other bargaining solutions.
A recently popular activity that our model captures is flipping.4 According to Wikipedia,
this is “purchasing a revenue-generating asset and quickly reselling (or ‘flipping’) it for
profit.” Although one can flip any asset, the moniker is usually applied to real estate, or
sometimes IPO’s. As regards our focus on intermediation chains, “Under the multiple investor flip, one investor purchases a property at below-market value, assigns or sells it quickly
to a second investor, who subsequently sells it to the final consumer, closer to market value.”
Of course, “Profits from flipping real estate come from either buying low and selling high
(often in a rapidly-rising market), or buying a house that needs repair and fixing it up before reselling.” It is common to think that this activity may have something to do with the
generation of price bubbles in housing and other markets, defined here as equilibria where
prices diﬀer from their fundamental values. As we said, the model is capable of generating
bubble-like equilibria, if one sets it up just right. Part of the contribution is to show exactly
what model ingredients are necessary to generate bubbles.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out some basic assumptions
and examples. Section 3 presents our extension of the standard RW model. Section 4 goes
into detail concerning the dynamics of intermediation chains. Section 5 discusses bigger issues

The Basic Model

2.1

General Assumptions

Consider a set of agents A = {A1 , A2 , ...AN }, where N ≤ ∞. They are spatially separated
with the following connections: An can meet, and hence trade, with An−1 and An+1 but no
one else. We can represent the population as a graph with the set of nodes A connected as
show in Figure 1. There are search frictions, which means it can take time and other resources
for An to meet An+1 . There is an indivisible object x in fixed supply, and a divisible object
y that anyone can produce at unit cost (i.e., the utility of producing y units of this object is
−y). Only A1 is endowed with x, and he can either try to trade it to A2 in exchange for y1 ,
or consume it himself for utility γ 1 . Hence, γ 1 is A1 ’s opportunity cost of trading (later we
also consider production costs).

Figure 1: Population graph
Generally, if any agent An acquires x from An−1 , he can either consume it for payoﬀ
γ n , or try to trade it to An+1 for payoﬀ u(yn ) = yn . If A1 trades x to A2 and A2 trades it
to A3 ... before some AN eventually consumes it, we say that trade is intermediated and
call A2 , ...AN −1 intermediaries or middlemen. For most of what we do, it is assumed that
An exits the market after trading x to An+1 . If one wants to keep the economy going, one
can replace every An with a clone of himself after he exists. Alternatively, in Section 3 we
recycle agents by allowing them to continue rather than exit after trade (see, e.g., Burdett
and Coles 1999 for a discussion of cloning vs recycling in search models).

2.2

Example: N = 2

Consider N = 2, or equivalently for this exercise, N = ∞ with γ n > 0 for n ≤ 2 and γ n = 0
for all n > 2, since this implies x will never be traded beyond A2 (but see Sec. 6). This case
admits no middlemen, but is still useful for illustrating our trading protocol. Suppose A1
meets A2 and γ 2 > γ 1 , as otherwise there are no gains from trade, and A1 consumes x. Then
we assume they play the following game.
Stage 1: A1 moves by making an oﬀer “give me y1 for x.”
Stage 2: A2 moves by accepting or rejecting, where:
• accept means the game ends;
• reject means we go to stage 3.
Stage 3: Nature moves (a coin toss) with the property that:
• with probability θ1 , A1 makes A2 a take-it-or-leave-it oﬀer;
• with probability 1 − θ1 , A2 makes A1 a take-it-or-leave-it oﬀer.
Figure 2 shows the game tree.5 If the initial oﬀer y1 is accepted, A1 gets payoﬀ y1 and A2
gets γ 2 − y1 . If y1 is rejected, with probability θ1 , A1 gets the whole surplus leaving A2 with
his outside option 0, and with probability 1−θ1 , A1 gets his outside option γ 1 leaving A2 with
γ 2 − γ 1 . One subgame perfect equilibrium is: at stage 1, A1 makes A2 his reservation oﬀer,
which means A2 is indiﬀerent between accepting and rejecting, and he accepts. If agents are
risk neutral there is also a payoﬀ-equivalent equilibrium where the initial oﬀer is rejected
5

We are not sure of the original use of this extensive form, but it is obviously related to Stahl (1972),
Rubinstein (1982), Binmore (1987) and McCleod and Malcomson (1993), to name a few. The exact specification, with two rounds of bargaining, where the second has a coin toss to determine who makes the final
oﬀer, appeared in early versions of Cahuc, Postel-Vinay and Robin (2006), but they ultimately switched to
a diﬀerent game. See Marchesiani and Nosal (2010) for another recent application. But those applications
assume linear utility. We say more about the issues when we come to nonlinear utility, since with linear
utility, one can skip the first round and go right to a coin toss (e.g., as in Gale 1990 or Mortensen and Wright
2002). Since a coin toss induces risk, however, with risk aversion, skipping the first round is not bilaterally
eﬃcient. Generally, agents in the model would rather play our game, so we let them — since we are not
comfortable imposing that they do something not in the bilateral core.

Figure 2: Game tree
and we move to Stage 3, but one can refine that away by assuming either a probability ε > 0
of an exogenous breakdown, or a discount factor δ < 1, between rounds. Or, as we do below,
one can assume risk aversion. Then the equilibrium described above, with settlement in the
first round, is unique, so we focus on it in what follows.
The condition making A2 indiﬀerent to accepting or rejecting A1 ’s oﬀer is γ 2 − y1 =
(1 − θ1 ) (γ 2 − γ 1 ), or
y1 = (1 − θ1 )γ 1 + θ1 γ 2 .

(1)

The payoﬀ for A1 is γ 1 + θ1 (γ 2 − γ 1 ) and that for A2 is (1 − θ1 )(γ 2 − γ 1 ). Now, agents are
not compelled to participate, but as long as γ 2 > γ 1 we have γ 1 + θ1 (γ 2 − γ 1 ) ≥ γ 1 and
(1 − θ1 )(γ 2 − γ 1 ) ≥ 0, so their payoﬀs beat their outside options. Equivalently, defining the
total surplus as the sum of payoﬀs minus outside options, S12 = [γ 1 + θ1 (γ 2 − γ 1 )] − γ 1 +
[(1 − θ1 )(γ 2 − γ 1 )] = γ 2 − γ 1 , they trade as long as S12 ≥ 0, which means γ 2 ≥ γ 1 .
For comparison, consider the (generalized) Nash (1950) bargaining solution with threat
points given by outside options:
y1 = arg max (y − γ 1 )θ1 (γ 2 − y)1−θ1
y

(2)

Clearly (2) is solved by (1), so our game implements Nash’s bargaining solution. It also
implements Kalai’s (1977) proportional bargaining solution, since it is the same as Nash in
this example.6 We call the probability θn the bargaining power of An when he plays with
An+1 , and allow θn to vary across agents because we believe it is an important element of
intermediation activity — e.g., the fact that athletes, artists etc. employ agents may have to
do with comparative advantages in bargaining.7
If it takes time and eﬀort to meet An+1 , the value of search for An is Vn , where Vn satisfies
rVn = αn (yn − Vn ) − cn ,
with r the rate of time preference, αn a Poisson arrival rate, and cn a flow search (or inventory
or storage) cost. This implies
Vn =

αn yn − cn
,
r + αn

(3)

and hence An is willing to search for An+1 only if this exceeds his opportunity cost γ n , or
(r + αn ) γ n ≤ αn yn − cn .

(4)

By (4) and (1), search by A1 is viable if and only if
c1 + (r + α1 ) γ 1 ≤ α1 [(1 − θ1 )γ 1 + θ1 γ 2 ] ,

(5)

which says the expected payoﬀ covers the direct search cost and opportunity cost, appropriately capitalized. Since (5) implies S12 ≥ 0, the binding constraint for trade is the viability
of search, not the outside options.

2.3

Example: N = 3

Now consider N = 3: an originator A1 ; a potential end user A3 ; and a potential middleman
A2 . Equivalently, for this exercise, N = ∞ with γ n = 0 for all n > 3. Note A3 is a potential
6

This is because of linear utility, and is not true once we introduce curvature. Clippel and Eliaz (2011)
show that Nash and Kalai imply diﬀerent outcomes in a similar setup, even with linear utility, but with
information frictions.
7
RW use a simple surplus-splitting rule, corresponding to θn = 1/2 in our game when we have linear
utility. They say “The reason that we abandon the strategic approach [in their earlier work] here is that it
would greatly complicate the exposition without adding insights.” But Binmore, Rubinstein and Wolinsky
(1986) provide a strong argument in favor of the strategic approach — it makes the timing, threat points,
etc. less ambiguous and arbitray — and we find it clarifies rather than complicates the analysis.

end user in the sense that if he acquires x he consumes it, since there is no one left to take
it oﬀ his hands; it is possible, however, that A1 prefers consuming x rather than searching
for A2 , or that A2 prefers consuming it rather than searching for A3 . Diﬀerent from some
related models, here A1 and A3 cannot meet directly (this is relaxed in Sec. 3). Hence, the
only way to get x from A1 to A3 is via the intermediary A2 .8
Given these assumptions, we ask which trades occur, and at what terms. Working backwards, if A2 with x meets A3 then, as in the case N = 2, we have
y2 = (1 − θ2 )γ 2 + θ2 γ 3 .

(6)

The payoﬀs from this trade for A2 and A3 are y2 and (1 − θ2 )(γ 3 − γ 2 ), respectively. The
total surplus is S23 = γ 3 − γ 2 , and they trade as long as γ 3 ≥ γ 2 . More stringently, for search
by A2 to be viable we require V2 ≥ γ 2 , or
c2 + (r + α2 ) γ 2 ≤ α2 [(1 − θ2 )γ 2 + θ2 γ 3 ] .

(7)

If (7) holds then, upon acquiring x, A2 looks to trade it to A3 ; if (7) fails then A2 consumes
x himself and A3 is irrelevant.
So, suppose (7) holds, and back up to where A1 meets A2 . When A1 makes his initial
oﬀer, A2 ’s indiﬀerence condition is −y1 + V2 = (1 − θ1 ) (V2 − γ 1 ). Inserting V2 , we have

Thus, we cannot ask here why the market doesn’t cut out the middlemen — or, in more modern jargon,
why there isn’t disintermediation. On that issue, practioners say this: “why doesn’t every wholesaler just
buy from the manufacture and get the deepest discount? The answer is simple — not all wholesalers (or
companies claiming to be wholesalers) can aﬀord to purchase the minimum bulk-order requirements that a
manufacture requires. Secondly, many manufactures only do business with companies that are established”
(Ellis 2009). We do not model this explicitly, but it might be worth pursuing in future work.

Summarizing, after some algebra, for x to pass from A1 to A2 to A3 we require
(r + α2 ) c1 + α1 θ1 c2 ≤ − (r + α1 θ1 ) (r + α2 )γ 1 + α1 θ1 α2 (1 − θ2 )γ 2 + α1 θ1 α2 θ2 γ 3 (9)
c2 ≤ − (r + α2 θ2 ) γ 2 + α2 θ2 γ 3 .

(10)

If the inequality in (10) is reversed then A2 consumes x if he gets it, and he gets it if
c1 ≤ − (r + α1 θ1 ) γ 1 + α1 θ1 γ 2

(11)

since this makes search by A1 viable when A2 consumes x.9 As a special case, when frictions
vanish, in the sense that r → 0 and cn → 0, search by A2 is viable if and only if γ 3 ≥ γ 2 . If
A2 searches, in this case, search by A1 is viable if and only if γ 1 ≤ (1 − θ2 )γ 2 + θ2 γ 3 ; and if
A2 does not search, then search by A1 is viable if and only if γ 2 ≥ γ 1 .
To develop some more economic intuition, consider the case where we do not take search
frictions to 0, so that r > 0 and cn > 0, but suppose γ 2 = 0 so that A2 is a pure middleman
with no desire to consume x himself. If A2 acquires x he searches for A3 if the expected
payoﬀ exceeds the search cost, α2 θ2 γ 3 ≥ c2 . If this inequality is reversed A2 does not want
x, and the market shuts down. But if α2 θ2 γ 3 ≥ c2 , so that A2 would search for A3 , then A1
searches for A2 if and only if
(r + α2 ) c1 + α1 θ1 c2 ≤ − (r + α1 θ1 ) (r + α2 )γ 1 + α1 θ1 α2 θ2 γ 3 .
In words, the RHS is A1 ’s expected share of A2 ’s expected share of the end user’s payoﬀ, net
of his opportunity cost, while the LHS is A1 ’s direct search cost and the amount he has to
compensate A2 for A2 ’s search costs, all appropriately capitalized.
If γ 2 = 0 and r → 0, cn → 0, then A1 searches for A2 who searches for A3 if and only if
θ2 γ 3 ≥ γ 1 . The key point here is that γ 3 > γ 1 is not enough to get x from A1 to A3 , even
when γ 2 , r and cn are negligible, due to a holdup problem. Potential middleman A2 knows
that A3 is willing to give anything up to γ 3 to get x, and A1 would be willing to let it go for as
little as γ 1 , which sounds like there is a deal to be done. But when A2 meets A3 he only gets
9
To be clear, reversing the inequality in (11) means A1 will not search for A2 given that A2 consumes x,
but search by A1 may still be viable if A2 , instead of consuming it, flips x to A3 .

9

y2 = θ2 γ 3 . He may protest he needs more just to cover his cost, y1 = (1 − θ1 ) γ 1 + θ1 θ2 γ 3 .
Being educated in economics, however, A3 would (implicitly) counter that this cost is sunk
and thus irrelevant in the negotiations. So A2 will not intermediate the deal unless θ2 γ 3 ≥ γ 1 .
This is a market failure, due to lack of commitment. If A3 and A2 could sign a binding ex
ante contract, the former could agree to pay the latter at least enough to cover his costs.
Such commitment is proscribed here: as in many search models, it seems reasonable to say
you cannot contract with someone before you contact someone.
RW specify a clever way to potentially get around such holdup problems: have A2 get
x from A1 , but only pay him after he sellers it. RW call this consignment. Then when A2
and A3 trade, y1 it is not sunk. Of course, this only works if A2 and A1 can make contact
after A2 trades with A3 . If they can, then when A2 meets A3 , the indiﬀerence condition is
γ 3 − y2 = (1 − θ2 )(γ 3 − γ 2 − y1 ). So when A1 meets A2 , knowing he will not get y1 until A2
retrades, his oﬀer making A2 indiﬀerent is V2 −

(13)

Notice y2 > y1 , so A2 now not only covers his cost, he makes a profit. One can work out
the viability conditions for A1 to search given A2 searches, and for A1 to search given A2
consumes x, just like we did for the model without consignment.10
Putting this all together, Figure 3 illustrates the equilibria that obtain in diﬀerent regions
of (c1 , c2 ) space for the models with and without consignment, partitioned by dashed and
solid lines, respectively. Clearly, with consignment, the market is more likely to be active,
and one can check that both middlemen and sellers get higher payoﬀs. We do not think
either version of the model is superior, however: either consignment is feasible, and hence it
10

For the record, with consignment the conditions for both A1 and A2 to search are:
0 ≥ c2 − α2 θ2 γ 3 − (1 − θ2 )(1 − θ1 ) (r + α2 ) γ 1 + {(r + α2 ) [1 − θ1 (1 − θ2 )] − α2 (1 − θ2 )}γ 2

+ (r + α1 ) (r + α2 ) [1 − θ1 (1 − θ2 )]γ 1 .

And the condition for A1 to search given A2 consumes x is the same condition as in the model without
consignment. Details of these calculations, which are straightforward but tedious, are available on request.

Figure 3: Equilibrium with and without Consignment
should be used, or it is not (say, if the physical environment is such that A1 deals with A2
just the once, never to meet again, which certainly seems relevant in some contexts). Rather
than say one model is better, we merely compare outcomes in the two cases. A general
conclusion we draw from the model is that whether exchange even gets oﬀ the ground, and
the terms of trade when it does, depend on not only fundamentals and bargaining power
in any one trading opportunity, but also on these parameters in downstream opportunities.
Thus, the gains from trade between A1 and A2 , e.g., depend on A2 ’s bargaining power when
he later meets A3 . This is what we mean by bargaining with bargainers.

Alternative Specification

Consider a slightly diﬀerent setup, designed to be closer to RW, where again there are N = 3
types but now there are many agents of each type. Again, the types are called originators
A1 , potential middlemen A2 , and potential end users A3 , with γ 1 = γ 2 = 0 and γ 3 = γ > 0.
Although there is no opportunity cost of trading x for A1 when γ 1 = 0, we allow a production
cost k ≥ 0. But the key diﬀerence from our baseline specification is that now anyone can
meet anyone else. The main object of the analysis, in addition to determining if the market

11

is even open, is to ascertain when middlemen are active, since A1 has the option of trying to
trade directly with A3 . Also, now we assume all agents continue in, rather than exit from,
the market after a trade. Let π n be the measure of type n agents, with π1 + π 2 + π 3 = 1, and
let αnn0 be the rate at which An meets An0 .11 Let σ n ∈ {0, 1} indicate whether or not An
searches, n = 1, 2, and let μ ∈ {0, 1} indicate whether or not A1 trades with A2 . Let m be
the steady state probability that A2 is in possession of x, and to keep track of inventories,
for middlemen, write V2i where i ∈ {0, 1}.
The steady state value of m equates the inflow and outflow of inventories, mα23 =
(1 − m)α21 σ 1 μ, which solves for
m=

π1 α12 σ 1 μ
.
π2 α23 + π 1 α12 σ 1 μ

Taking m as given, the value functions satisfy

n, we have the identities π1 α12 = π 2 α21 , π2 α23 = π 3 α32 and π 3 α31 = π1 α13 (one can think of the π’s as
primitives, putting restrictions on the α’s, or vice-versa).

Table 1: Candidate equilibria

Table 1 contains a lot of information, because it covers all 8 cases, but it is actually easy
to understand. Consider s = (0, 0, 0), where A1 doesn’t search, A1 wouldn’t trade with A2
if they were to meet, and A2 wouldn’t search if he had x. As indicated, for σ 1 = 0 to be a
best response we require V1 ≤ k, which after routine algebra reduces to e
c1 ≤ c1 , given other

agents’ strategies; for μ = 0 to be a best response we require S12 ≤ 0, which reduces to

c1 ≥ c1 ; and for σ2 = 0 to be a best response we require V2 ≤ 0, which reduces to c2 ≤ c2 . In
the last column we mention some properties of the candidate equilibria, e.g., for s = (0, 0, 0)

Figure 4: Equilibria with k = 0
we note that k = 0 implies e
c1 = c1 , which is satisfied only on a set of measure zero in

parameter space. In discussing the results, we focus on economics, with algebra available

on request. Basically, all the economics can be seen in (c1 , c2 ) space using Figure 4, drawn
using the easily-verified results h(0) > g(0) and h(c1 ) = g(c1 ) = c2 .
To facilitate the presentation, we begin with k = 0, which limits the types of equilibria
that can exist. First we deal with equilibria with σ1 = 0, where A1 does not search and the
market shuts down. Even if σ1 = 0, we must specify as part of the equilibrium whether A1
and A2 would trade if they were to meet, and whether A2 would search if he acquired x,
oﬀ the equilibrium path (subgame perfection). There are two possible equilibria where A1
does not search, s = (0, 1, 0) and s =(0, 1, 1), as Figure 4 shows.12 In each case A1 and A2
would trade if they were to meet, and in one A2 would search while in the other he would
not. Naturally, these no-trade outcomes occur when c1 and c2 are above certain thresholds.
This is not surprising; the point of the analysis is to determine exactly how the thresholds
depend on search and bargaining parameters, the α’s and θ’s, and the fundamental value γ.
12

There are two other candidate equilibria where σ 1 = 0, s = (0, 0, 0) and s = (0, 0, 1), but they exist only
for parameters in a set of measure zero when k = 0.

14

When c1 is lower but c2 still high, s = (1, 0, 0) is an equilibrium, where A1 trades with A3
but not A2 . Middlemen are inactive in this equilibrium, and A2 would not search even if he
had x. Algebra implies σ 1 = 1 is a best response if and only if c1 ≥ c1 , and σ2 = 0 is a best
response if and only if c2 ≤ c2 . There is no intermediation because A2 has high search costs
(c2 /γ is big), meets A3 infrequently (α23 is small), or bargains poorly (θ23 is low). When c1
and c2 are both lower, however, as Figure 4 shows, s = (1, 1, 1) is an equilibrium, where A1
searches and trades with A3 or A2 , and A2 searches for A3 when he gets x. Now there is
intermediation. Again, it is routine to check the best response conditions, which reduce to
h(c1 ) ≥ c2 and c2 ≥ c2 . The diagonal line h(c1 ) represents how A1 ’s search decision depends
on c2 , because y12 depends on A2 ’s expected cost and benefit from search (another instance
of downstream bargaining aﬀecting negotiations). Of particular interest is the region where
c1 > c1 and c2 < h (c1 ), where the market is active only because of intermediation — i.e., if
A2 were absent all trade would cease.
This exhausts the set of possible pure-strategy equilibria.13 As Figure 4 shows, the
outcome is essentially unique — i.e., the regions do not overlap — but there is an empty area
between c2 = h (c1 ) and c2 = g (c1 ), where pure-strategy equilibria do not exist. The problem
is that when σ 1 = 1 the steady state distribution of inventories held by A2 , summarized by
m, is such that V1 < k, so A1 does not want to search, and when σ 1 = 0 the steady state m is
such that V1 > k, so A1 does want to search. In Appendix A, we show how to construct the
natural mixed-strategy equilibrium that fills in this region, with σ 1 = σ∗1 ∈ (0, 1) and V1 = k,
meaning either A1 agents randomizes, or some search and others do not. This completes the
analysis for k = 0.
The results are similar, if algebraically more intense, when A1 has production cost k >
0, as shown in Figure 5. Compared to Figure 4, three additional types of pure-strategy
equilibrium pop up in the region [c1 , e
c1 ] × [c2 , e
c2 ], which was a non-issue with k = 0, because

then cj = e
cj . These include two new no-trade outcomes, (0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1), plus a new
13

Actually, a minor technicality is that when equilibrium (1, 0, 0) exists, so does (1, 1, 0). It may seem
strange that A2 trades for x and then neither searches nor consumes x, but this is an equilibrium since in
this case y12 = 0 and A1 has production cost k = 0. Since this cannot happen for any k > 0, we ignore it.
Any other candidate equilibrium in Table 1 exists at most for parameters in a set of measure zero.

active equilibrium with (1, 0, 1). In the latter case, A1 searches, trades with A3 and not A2 ,
but if A2 acquired x, oﬀ the equilibrium path, he would search for A3 . It may be at least as
relevant to add not only a production cost A1 , but also a production cost for A2 before he
retrades x, capturing the cost of improvements as when flipping real estate. The results for
this case (not show) are essentially the same, but all regions in Figure 5 shift down, and in
particular, the region with active middlemen region shrinks, naturally.
We now compare our predictions with those in the original RW model. One diﬀerence
that does not make RW a special case of our setup is that they only recycle A2 , replacing
A1 and A3 by clones, after each trade. We also solved our model with that assumption, and
the results basically diﬀer only in the region for s = (1, 1, 1) now being bounded above by
f(c1 ). The main result in RW is that middlemen are active if and only if they meet end users
faster than originators meet end users, α23 > α13 . Setting cn = kn = 0, as in RW, but still
allowing general θ’s, we can show the following: when all agents are recycled, middlemen are
active if and only if α23 θ23 > 0 and α12 θ12 > 0; and when A2 are recycled while A1 and A3
are cloned, they are active if and only if α23 θ23 > α13 θ13 and α12 θ12 > 0. Interestingly, what

16

matters here are the products of the α’s and θ’s, as emphasized in some other search models
(e.g., Lagos and Rocheteau 2009). Naturally, the results also depend on who gets recycled
or cloned.14
Having solved (several versions of) this model, we now revert to the baseline specification,
with an arbitrary number of types N, but An can only trade x to An+1 . The main point of
this section is two fold: First, it provides a strict generalization of the standard RW model,
allowing for diﬀerences in bargaining powers, search or production costs, etc. Second, it
demonstrates that the economic content of the results is quite similar here and in our baseline
model, as one can see by comparing Figure 4 or 5 with Figure 3. Since the economics is
similar, and given the baseline version is more tractable, for what we do next, we use it in
what follows.

Solving for yn , we have

(23)

We interpret yn = ρn (yn+1 ) as a best response condition for An : it gives yn , his initial oﬀer
strategy when he meets An+1 , as a function of others’ strategies, as summarized by yn+1
which is all he needs to know when he chooses yn .
Conditional on An having acquired x, it is easy to see that An and An+1 end up trading
in equilibrium if and only if:
14

We can compare this models and RW in terms of other predictions, e.g. we can show y23 > y13 > y12 ,
as in RW, with symmetric bargaining. We can also compute, as in RW, intermediaries’ profit margin,
y23 − y12 = rγ

θ23 [r + α13 θ13 + α21 (1 − θ12 ) + α12 θ12 (1 − m)] + (1 − θ12 ) (α23 θ23 − α13 θ13 )
,
[r + α23 θ23 + α21 (1 − θ12 )](r + α13 θ13 ) + (r + α23 θ23 ) α12 θ12 (1 − m)

and show it is increasing in α23 and θ23 , and vanishes as r → 0.

r + αn

2. Vn,n+1 = yn ≥ γ n , so An wants to trade;
3. Vn+1,n = −yn + Vn+1 ≥ 0, so An+1 wants to trade.
The second condition is not binding given the first, while the third reduces to
yn+1 ≥

γ n (r + αn+1 ) + cn+1
.
αn+1

(24)

Now, to investigate how long intermediation chains can be, consider a quasi-stationary environment, where αn , cn and θn are the same for all n, while γ n = γ for n ≤ N, γ N+1 = γ̂ > γ,
and γ n = 0 for n > N + 1. We call AN+1 the end user because, if he gets x, he consumes it,
since An does not value x for n > N + 1.15
Now (23) can be written yn = ρ (yn+1 ) for n < N, where ρ (y) = (1−θ)γ+θ (αy − c) / (r + α),
while yN = (1 − θ) γ + θγ̂. Clearly, ρ(y) has a unique fixed point,
y∗ =

(1 − θ)γ (r + α) − θc
,
r + α(1 − θ)

where we assume c < (1 − θ)γ (r + α) /θ so y ∗ > 0. See Figure 6, where (it is easy to check)
yN > γ > y ∗ > ρ (0). The way to read in Figure 6 is: given An+1 correctly anticipates
getting yn+1 from An+2 , in bargaining with An the equilibrium outcome is yn . Now, to find
equilibrium, begin by working backwards: set yN = (1−θ)γ +θγ̂ and iterate on yn = ρ (yn+1 )
to construct a sequence {yn }, where it is obvious that yn → y ∗ as n → −∞. Then, since we
are actually interested in what happens as n increases, moving forward in real time, pick a
point in this sequence and iterate forward. This generates a candidate equilibrium.
The sequence thus constructed is still only a candidate equilibrium because we still have
to check if search is viable for all agents in the chain. Clearly we cannot have arbitrarily long
chains, since, going backwards in time, this would involve starting arbitrarily close to y ∗ < γ,
and if yn < γ the holder of x would rather consume it than search. Consider, e.g., starting
with AN−2 holding x. Suppose AN−2 searches and trades x to AN−1 , who then searches and
15

As above, we are asserting that x cannot go from AN+1 to AN+2 when γ n = 0 for all n > N + 1. This
follows as a special case of the no-bubble result given below for models with linear utility.

If c is not too big, we can support trade with two middlemen between the originator and
end user. For any c > 0 we cannot support trade with an arbitrary number of middlemen:
yN−j → y ∗ < γ implies there is a maximum viable chain. However, if γ = c = 0, then y ∗ = 0
and there are arbitrarily long chains starting near 0 and ending at yN .
Even this simple model generates some interesting predictions. To illustrate, let Tn be
the random date when An trades x to An+1 . There are two striking properties of our trading
process, one from economics and one from statistics. First, as is obvious from Figure 6 and
reproduced in Figure 7, 4y increases over time: as x gets closer to the end user, not only
y but the increments in y rise. Second, since the underlying arrival rates are Poisson, as
is well known, the interarrival times Tn − Tn−1 are distributed exponentially. This entails a
high probability of short, and a low probability of long, interarrival times. Hence, typical
realizations of the process have trades clustered, with many exchanges occurring in short
intervals separated by long intervals of inactivity. This gives the distinct appearance of
19

y

time

Figure 7: Typical realized path for y
market frenzies interspersed by long lulls, although since Poisson arrivals are memoryless
there are indubitably no frenzies or lulls in any meaningful economic sense.16
Figure 7 illustrates these two features of equilibrium: the statistical property that intervals
of rapid activity are interspersed by long lulls; and the economic property that y grows at an
increasing rate as it approaches the end user. To the naive eye this may resemble bubble-like
behavior, but we cannot emphasize strongly enough that this is not a bubble. Everything in
equilibrium is pinned down by the fundamental (utility) value of x and by bargaining power:
the terminal condition is yN = (1 − θ) γ + θγ̂, and from this, the stochastic trading process
is given by iterating on yn = ρ (yn+1 ). Does this mean bubbles are impossible? We address
this in Sec. 7, after discussing some more basic issues.

Discussion

Since the Introduction, we have refrained from using the words buyer, seller and price. This
is intentional, as we want to raise some issues associated with such usage. First, we contend
16

This is explained in any good text on stochastic processes. As Çinlar (1975, 79-80), e.g., puts it: “the
interarrival times T1 , T2 − T1 , T3 − T2 , ... are independent and identically distributed random variables, with
the ... exponential distribution ... Note that this density is monotone decreasing. As a result, an interarrival
time is more likely to have a length in [0, s] than in a length in [t, t + s] for any t. Thus, a Poisson process
has more short intervals than long ones. Therefore, a plot of the time series of arrivals on a line looks, to
the naive eye, as if the arrivals occur in clusters.” Yet the memoryless property implies that “knowing that
an interarrival time has already lasted t units does not alter the probability of its lasting another s units.”

20

that in the analog to our model found in much of the search literature, in our notation, x
represents a good and y money; and on this interpretation y is the price, the agent who
trades x for y is a seller, and the one who trades y for x is a buyer. Noteworthy models that
we view in this way, in addition to those on middlemen discussed earlier, include Diamond
(1971,1987), Butters (1977), Burdett-Judd (1983) and Rubinstein-Wolinsky (1985), all of
which have an indivisible object corresponding to x called a consumption good (or in some
applications a production good like labor), and a divisible object y interpreted as the price
(or wage). Of course, although they may think of y as dollars, these models do not literally
have money — what they have is transferrable utility.17
Identifying money with (more accurately, confusing money with) transferrable utility is
standard fare by even the best economic theorists. Consider Binmore (1992): “Sometimes it
is assumed that contracts can be written that specify that some utils are to be transferred
from one player to another ... Alert readers will be suspicious about such transfers ...
Utils are not real objects and so cannot really be transferred; only physical commodities
can actually be exchanged. Transferable utility therefore only makes proper sense in special
cases. The leading case is that in which both players are risk-neutral and their von Neumann
and Morgenstern utility scales have been chosen so that their utility from a sum of money x
is simply U (x) = x. Transferring one util from one player to another is then just the same
17

Submitted in evidence, from middlemen papers, consider the following: Rubinstein-Wolinsky (1987,
p.582) describe payoﬀs as “consumption values (in monetary terms).” Biglaiser (1993, p.213) says “Each
buyer is endowed with money.” Yavas (1994) describes a standard model of middleman by “The sellers and
the middlemen value the good (in monetary terms) at zero, while the buyers value the good at one.” Yavas
(1992) is more careful, saying “In order to avoid the additional questions associated with having money in
the economy, this endowment has not been labeled as money.” Johri-Leach (2002) are also careful to say
“units of a divisible numeraire good are exchanged for units of an indivisible heterogeneous good,” although
they have no problem assuming payoﬀs are linear in the former. Even those less cavalier about money are
quick to deem who is a buyer or seller and what is the price.
In search theory outside the middleman literature, Butters (1977, p.466) says “A single homogeneous
good is being traded for money,” while Burdett-Judd (1983, pp.955,960) say consumers search “to lower the
expected costs of acquiring, a desired commodity, balancing the monetary cost of search against its monetary
benefit,” while firms want to “make more money.” Diamond (1971,1987) does not mention money explicitly,
but he thinks of y as the price, and buyers are those with payoﬀ γ − y while sellers are those with payoﬀ y.
In several places Osborne-Rubinstein (1990) decribe models where “A single indivisible good is traded for
some quantity of a divisible good (‘money’).” Gale (1987, p.20) more accurately says “A single, indivisible
commodity is traded. Buyers and sellers have transferable utility.” To sum up, with some exceptions, this
literature suggests we interpret x as a good, y as a money price, An as a seller and An+1 as a buyer.

21

as transferring one dollar.” Unfortunately, it ain’t necessarily so — and this is about more
than an abhorrence for the dubious, if evidently not discredited, practice of putting money
in the utility function.
In serious monetary theory, it is not trivial to transfer dollars across agents, because
they tend to run out. No one has an unlimited supply of cash in hand, and for almost all
inflation rates, other than the Friedman rule, agents carry less than the amount required
for unconstrained trade. And, in any case, payoﬀs are usually not linear in dollars, with
some exceptions, such as models following Lagos-Wright (2005); even there, however, buyers
typically end up running out of money, which makes it very diﬀerent from transferrable
utility. Examples of search-based monetary theory that look like the setup in this paper
include the models in Shi (1995), Trejos-Wright (1995), Kocherlakota (1998), Wallace (2001)
and many others. The point we emphasize is that all those models take a diametric position
to the above-mentioned applications outside of monetary economics: they assume y is a
consumption good and x is money.
An obvious diﬀerence across these interpretations is that, under one, money (y) is divisible
and the consumption good (x) is indivisible, while under the other, money (x) is indivisible
and good (y) is indivisible. Superficially this favors the first view, as divisibility is a property
(along with storability, portability etc.) commonly associated with money, but on reflection
we do think this should be given much weight, since we could easily make x and y divisible.
Better discriminating criteria stem from the functional definitions of money: it is a unit
of account, store of value and medium of exchange. The unit of account function, which
means American prices tend to be quoted in dollars and European prices in euros, seems
uninteresting, since for anything of consequence it cannot matter much whether we measure
prices in dollars or euros any more than whether we measure distance in feet or meters.
Regarding the store of value function, it is clear in the model that it is x and not y playing
that role: x is a durable good that, when acquired by An enables him to enjoy a payoﬀ yn
at a future date. The more natural interpretation of y is that it is a perishable good, or a
service, produced for immediate consumption, and it is hard to imagine that as money.

22

By contrast, x, which is kept in inventory, is obviously a storable asset and satisfies the
standard definition of a medium of exchange: an object that is accepted in trade not to be
consumed or used in production by those who accept it, but instead to be traded again later.
Now, in the above model x happens to be commodity money, since an end user ultimately
does consume it for a direct payoﬀ, as opposed to fiat money which does not generate a
direct payoﬀ for anyone. But y is certainly not a medium of exchange in the above models:
it is accepted by everyone for its direct payoﬀ, and never to be traded again later. Moreover,
it is exactly a double-coincidence problem that makes x useful: when An wants y from An+1 ,
he has nothing to oﬀer except asset x. One could also argue x plays much the same role
that money plays in non-search monetary theory, such as overlapping-generations models
(Wallace 1980), although we do not have space to go into this here. Based on all this, in
terms of calling either x or y money, readers can decide for themselves, but it looks to us
like the monetary theorists got this one right.
Does it matter? While at some level one might say the issue is purely semantic, as if
that were reason not to be interested, we think it actually may matter substantively for how
one uses the theory. For instance, it determines who we call the buyer or seller and what
we mean by the price. To make this point, we first argue that in nonmonetary exchange —
say, when A gives B apples for bananas — it is not meaningful to call either agent a buyer
or seller. Of course, one can call them whatever one likes, but then the labels buyer and
seller convey nothing more than calling them A and B. However, when A gives B apples
for genuine money, for dollars or euros, everyone should agree that A is the seller and B the
buyer (it is perhaps less clear what to call them when A gives B euros for dollars, but that is
beside the point). We identify agents who pay money as buyers and ones who receive money
as sellers, and claim this corresponds to standard usage.18
18

As evidence, consider the following definitions of the verbs buy and sell : “acquisition of an article, and
legal assumption of its ownership, in exchange for money or value” and “to transfer ownership of a property
in exchange for money or value” (businessdictionary.com); “to aquire possession, ownership, or rights to the
use or services of by payment especially of money” and “to give up (property) for something of value (as
money)” (Meriam Webster); “to acquire the possession of, or the right to, by paying or promising to pay
an equivalent, esp. in money” and “to transfer (goods) to or render (services) for another in exchange for
money” (Dictionary.com); or “to get something by paying money for it” and “to give something to someone
else in return for money” (Cambridge Dictionaries Online).

23

Again, one can label objects anything one likes, and be on firm ground logically, if not
aesthetically. But would anyone want to reverse the labels in, say, the Mortensen-Pissarides
(1994) labor-market model, taking the agents we usually think of as workers and calling them
firms, and vice versa? One could prove the same theorems, but it would make a diﬀerence
when considering applied questions (e.g., should we tax/subsidize search by workers or by
firms?). Using the interpretation in the previous middlemen literature, where y is money
and x is a good, when An and An+1 trade the former is the seller and the latter is the
buyer. Using the interpretation in the monetary literature mentioned above, where x is
money and y is a good, An is the buyer and An+1 is the seller. If one agrees that it makes
a substantive diﬀerence who we call workers and firms in the labor market, it can similarly
make a diﬀerence who we call buyers and sellers in goods markets (e.g., for substantive
questions, like should we tax/subsidize shoppers or retailers?).
Moreover, the two interpretations give opposite predictions for price behavior. If we
normalize the size of the indivisible x to 1, without loss of generality, under the interpretation
that y is money and x is a good, the price is obviously y. But if y is the good and x is money
then 1/y is the price, since now a normalized unit of money buys y units of the good. To
see how this matters, look back at Figure 7. Using the first interpretation, theory predicts
prices are rising over time, as more and more money y is required to buy the same amount
of consumption x as we get closer to the end user. Using the second interpretation, prices
are falling, as over time more and more consumption y can be acquired for the same amount
of money x. For empirical work, at least, one has to make a choice. We do not propose one
irreproachable interpretation, since this depends on the issues at hand. We do think it is
relevant to broach the issue.
We also find it intriguing that, from a legal standpoint, it often makes a vital diﬀerence
who we construe as buyer and seller. It is not uncommon to have laws or conventions that
allow buyers to return goods and demand a refund, or at least store credit, within a certain
period of time with no questions asked — the principle of caveat emptor notwithstanding.19
19

“The two basic types of warranties are express warranties and implied warranties. An express warranty
is any representation or aﬃrmation about the goods made by the seller’s words or conduct. ... Implied

24

We are not aware of similar laws or conventions applying to sellers, and, with rare exceptions like bad checks or counterfeit currency, accepting monetary payment entails finality —
suggesting a more rigorous principle of caveat venditor. Also, in law, “There is a ‘bias’ in
favour of buyers. Buyers are not obligated to disclose what they know about the value of a
seller’s property, but sellers are under a qualified obligation to disclose material facts about
their own property.” (Ramsay 2006). Beyond legal systems narrowly construed, is also true
that private trading platforms, like ebay, have rules and regulations that treat buyers and
sellers diﬀerently (see, e.g., Beal 2009).
We also cannot help but comment on the asymmetric treatment of buyers and sellers in
illegal markets. It is commonly understood that with drugs and prostitution, the one who
receives the money is usually treated much more harshly than the one who pays (which raises
a question about trading drugs directly for sex, but like trading dollars for euros, this is beside
the point). Indeed, with drugs, it is so much more common to target sellers than buyers that
targeting the latter is referred to as a “reverse sting” operation. With prostitution, buyers
have almost always been treated much more leniently than sellers.20 Similarly, sellers are
typically the bigger villains where illegal gambling, booze, guns, fireworks etc are concerned.
Although we are less sure about it, we conjecture this is also true for stolen merchandise.
And note, by the way, that a fence is a middleman in our model. Intermediaries in general
and fences in particular are often considered less than honorable, if not outright heinous,
perhaps because they do not themselves produce anything and simply profit from others,
as evidenced by our epigraph referring to “bloodsucking bastards” and by other timeless
warranties are warranties that are imposed on sellers by law. A warranty of merchantability is implied
in every sales contract. This warranty is a promise that the goods pass without objection in the trade,
are adequately packaged, conform to all promises or aﬃrmations of fact on the container, and are fit for
the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. The implied warranty of merchantability also includes a promise that multiple goods will be of even kind and quality.” From “Sales Law - Warranties” at
http://law.jrank.org/pages/9989/Sales-Law-Warranties.html.

An obvious exception is when politicians get caught with prostitutes, but in general, the point is valid.
See the “The Staight Dope” at http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2774/prostitution. Of course,
some argue that this is merely another manifestation of male dominance: “As long as society remains male
dominated, women selling sex will be in a more vulnerable position than men buying sex.” See “The swedish
approach to prostitution” at http://www.sos-sexisme.org/English/swedish.htm. This suggest an obvious
empirical test by looking at male prostitutes if one were willing to swallow some rather dubious ceterus
paribus assumptions.

condemnations of moneylenders and the like. This, of course, at least in part comes from
ignorance of the idea that getting goods from A to B is a productive activity.
In any case, for what it’s worth, we find it interesting that it is the norm to deem sellers
— those who receive money in exchange for goods — worse in legal and moral senses than
buyers — those who receive goods in exchange for money. There are exceptions, as in the
case of in child prostitution, but this can be explained by saying that the distinction between
adults and minors takes precedence over the distinction between buyers and sellers without
denying the existence of the latter. Another exception might be when a student, or, perish
the thought, a professor, gives someone money to write a paper for them.21
Returning to the theory, consider again Figure 1. The usual approach to middlemen
interprets x as a consumption good being passed from originator to end user by chains of
intermediaries. At each link in the chain x trades for yn units of money — or, better, for yn
transferable utils — or, better still, for some amount of a diﬀerent consumption good that
is produced at cost yn by An+1 and consumed for utility yn by An . We have no problem
with linear utility, our quibble is more about asserting that agents getting direct utility from
money, or if it is interpreted as indirect utility, that the value function is linear in dollars.
These issues aside, we think our framework provides a useful model of intermediation chains,
where one good x trades for another good y, or even a sequence of diﬀerent goods {yn }, since
it is easy to imagine An altering or improving x in some way before he flips it to An+1 . But
it is also a coherent model of agents trading an asset x in exchange for goods produced at
cost yn by An+1 and consumed for utility yn by An .
Also notice that if we use modulo N arithmetic, our chain becomes a circle, where A1
21

Our objective is to point out asymmetries between buyers and sellers, not to explain them, but there are
various rationales. On focusing enforcement on drug or gun dealers rather than buyers, it is sometimes said
there are barriers to entry, at least at the high end, so that it is diﬃcult for newcomers to replace those who
are incarcerated (Koper and Reuter 1995). Yet the reverse argument can be made at the low end, where a
dealer removed from a streetcorner is quickly replaced. Other arguments include the view that those who
profit most from illegal activity should face highest risk of punishment, as should those that provide bad role
models by their financial success. Another is the principle that we ethically judge actions that put others
at risk more harshly than those that put oneself at risk; while this might ring true for drugs, it is diﬃcult
to make the case for prostitutes. The same might be said for the position that if B is weak and A exploits
that weakness, A should be judged more harshly. There is also the idea that for many markets, legal or
illegal, sellers have a lot more transactions than buyers, so it is cost eﬀective to go after sellers. We leave
exploration of these ideas to future research.

consumes the output of A2 who consumes the output ... of AN who consumes the output
of A1 . This looks like the environment used to study money in Kiyotaki and Wright (1989),
or the generalization in Aiyagari and Wallace (1991). Hence, one might wonder, could the
model support equilibria where x, like some commodity money, is never consumed?

Intermediation Bubbles

This leads us to a discussion of bubbles.22 In the analysis so far, we could get chains of
trade, and with cn ≈ 0 these chains can be quite long, but the equilibrium is always tied
down by the fact that there is a determinate end user who consumes x. Now consider the
possibility that no one consumes x, and it gets passed around forever. For this exercise,
assume a stationary environment: αn = α, cn = c, θn = θ and γ n = γ for all n. The best
response function is
yn = (1 − θ)γ + θ

αyn+1 − c
= ρ(yn+1 ),

We will define what we mean by this term presently. The bubble literature is ever expanding, to the
extent that it is too big to go into here; recent papers by Farhi and Tirole (2010) and Rocheteau and Wright
(2010) provide extensive references and help put our results in context.

27

The principal diﬀerence from the quasi-stationary model, with a manifest end user AN+1 ,
is that we no longer have a terminal condition yN = θγ +(1−θ)γ̂ to tie down the equilibrium
path. Still, since yn = ρ(yn+1 ) implies ∂yn+1 /∂yn = (r + α)/αθ, as seen in Figure 8, there
is only one solution to the diﬀerence equation (25) that remains nonnegative and bounded:
yn = y ∗ for all n. Any path that starts at y > y ∗ looks like a bubble: agent An is willing
to search for An+1 because he expects a high yn , An+1 is willing to give a high yn because
he expects an even higher yn+1 , etc. But such explosive paths are not consistent with
equilibrium when we make the standard assumption that there is an upper bound on y, say
y (e.g., y could be total output of known universe). One cannot rationally believe that yn will
grow beyond y, and hence an explosive bubble-like sequence yn cannot be an equilibrium.
The only equilibrium is yn = y ∗ for all n, and γ > y ∗ implies Vn = (αy ∗ − c) / (r + α) < γ.
Since Vn < γ, in equilibrium, no one searches.
These results seem quite natural. How could there be no gains from trade when all agents
have the same γ? Hence, there is no trade on the equilibrium path. If An were to trade x to
An+1 , oﬀ the equilibrium path, he must get exactly yn = γ for it, since he couldn’t get more
and he wouldn’t take less. We call yn = γ the fundamental value of x, which is evidently
what it is worth in terms of intrinsic properties. In the above environment, there are no
gains from trade based on fundamentals. We would say that a bubble exists in this situation
when, in equilibrium, An and An+1 trade and this generates a positive surplus. The above
discussion implies that in this environment there cannot be bubbles in equilibrium.23
We now change the model slightly, by letting the utility of consuming y be U (y), with
U(0) = 0, U 0 > 0 and U ” < 0 (keeping the cost of producing y equal to y). Then yγ = U −1 (γ)
becomes the cost to An+1 of covering An ’s outside option γ, and our usual bargaining game
leads to
yn = (1 − θ)yγ + θ

= ρ (yn+1 )
r+α

(26)

in a stationary environment. Figure 9 shows a case where y ∗ > yγ , or equivalently, U(y ∗ ) > γ,
23

This version of a standard no-bubble result confirms as a special case our ealier assertion that if AN +1
gets x he will consume it in the quasi-stationary model with γ n = 0 for n > N + 1.

the search viability condition γ ≤ [rU(y∗ ) − c] /(r + α), we at least have a chance, which we
did not have with U(y) = y.
We now show by way of example that search and trade can be viable in equilibrium.

Since γ̄ > 0, search is viable for some γ > 0.

equilibrium, x circulates forever. For this to be viable we require [αU (y ∗ ) − c] / (r + α) ≥ γ,
and a fortiori y∗ > yγ . The amount of y required to acquire x is above the fundamental value
and the surplus from trade between An and An+1 is S ∗ = U (y ∗ ) −y∗ > 0, so by our definition
this a genuine bubble. Once this is understood it should be clear that, by continuity, we
can engineer similar bubbles when c > 0, or γ n varies across agents, or γ n = 0 for all n, or
even γ n < 0 for all n. All of these outcomes would appear anomalous in other contexts. Of
course, these results rely on “the economics of infinity” (Shell 1971), but in no way are they
fantastic or strange.
Can there be nonstationary bubbles? When ρ(0) > 0, Figure 9 suggests not. With
ρ(0) > 0, all paths satisfying (26), other than yn = y ∗ for all n, either lead to yn < 0 or
yn > ȳ. But suppose ρ(0) < 0, as in Figure 10, which occurs whenever c > yγ (r + α) (1 −
θ)/θ. As long as c is not too big, there are multiple steady states, y1∗ and y2∗ . Supposing
α [U(y1∗ ) − c] / (r + α) > γ, so that search is viable when yn is near y1∗ , then as shown
there are nonconstant paths for yn satisfying all the equilibrium conditions, even though
fundamentals are stationary. Starting to the left of y ∗ , yn rises over time in progressively
smaller increments, until settling at y1∗ ; starting from the right, yn falls in progressively
smaller increments until settling at y1∗ . Whether one says prices are rising or falling depends
on where one starts, as well as whether one takes x or y to be money, as discussed in the
previous section. In any case, the outcomes are all quite bubbly.
Although these results may not be too surprising to a monetary theorist, was it well
known that standard oﬀ-the-shelf models of intermediation like RW admit equilibria with
interesting dynamics once we introduce nonlinear utility? We doubt it. At least, we could
not find it in the middleman literature. Now, nonlinearity is crucial here because it allows
agents with perfect foresight to engage in what looks like “buying high and selling low.”
Consider starting to the right of y1∗ in Figure 10, where in equilibrium An+1 gives up yn
to get x, and later gives up x to get yn+1 < yn . This is ostensibly strange behavior for a
middleman, even without taking his time and other search costs into consideration. But it
is actually a good deal, since U (yn+1 ) exceeds yn by enough of a margin, even if yn+1 < yn .

Obviously this requires nonlinear utility. But now that we have let the nonlinear cat out of
the bag, it seems like a good time to revisit our bargaining solution.
First, it is important to understand that it is not necessary to use our particular extensive
form game to generate interesting dynamics. Consider instead generalized Nash:
yn = arg max[U (y) − γ]θ (Vn+1 − y)1−θ
y

The FOC is θ (Vn+1 − yn ) U 0 (y) = (1 − θ)[U (yn ) − γ], with the solution yn = ŷ (Vn+1 ), say.
Inserting Vn+1 we get a dynamical system yn = ρ̂ (yn+1 ) that is qualitatively similar to, but
not the same as, the system yn = ρ (yn+1 ) derived from our game. The same is true for
Kalai’s proportional solution,
θ (Vn+1 − y) = (1 − θ) [U (y) − γ],
which yields yet another dynamical system, yn = ρ̃ (yn+1 ). These three systems, ρ, ρ̂ and ρ̃,
all generate similar outcomes, including multiple stationary equilibria, and equilibria where
yn varies with n even though fundamentals are constant.
31

We like our bargaining solution because it has explicit strategic foundations, something
Nash himself argued was important for bargaining theory in general.25 This is often said to
also be a nice property of Nash bargaining: the ideas is that one can write down a standard
infinite-horizon strategic bargaining model, with randomly or deterministically alternating
oﬀers, take the limit as the time between oﬀers goes to 0, and out jumps the Nash solution, at
least in stationary situations (Binmore 1987; Binmore, Rubinstein and Wolinsky 1986). As
demonstrated in Coles and Wright (1998) and Coles and Muthoo (2003), however, this breaks
down in nonstationary situations unless one makes additional assumptions, like imposing
linear utility or giving one agent all the bargaining power. In general, in a nonstationary
bargaining situation, when one writes down exactly the same strategic bargaining model
and takes exactly the same limit, one gets a dynamical system for the terms of trade that
coincides with Nash in steady state but not out of steady state unless, in our notation,one
assumes that U(y) = y or θ = 1.
The above-mentioned papers also that, unless U (y) = y or θ = 1, using Nash out of
steady state is tantamount to using the alternating-oﬀer game where the players have myopic expectations (they believe continuation values are constant over time even though in
equilibrium they are not). To the extent that one wants strategic foundations for bargaining,
and wants to analyze dynamics, and to use nonlinear utility, this is a serious issue. Following
Nash, we want strategic foundations, and we want to analyze nonstationary equilibria since
this is an important aspect of bubble-like phenomena, and to use nonlinear utility, because
as we proved this is necessary to get bubbles in the first place. Hence, we like the game used
here. Having said this, for the record, and to show there is nothing especially funny about
√
this game, we now compare the outcome to Nash and Kalai bargaining when U (y) = y
(remember that with linear U they are all the same).
In Appendix B we show the following: for each bargaining solution there is an upper
bound for γ that makes search viable; in the limit when r → 0 the bounds all go to 1; and
25

The endeavor to write down explicit economic environments where axiomatic bargaining outcomes
emerge as an equilibrium is now commonly referred to as the Nash program (see, e.g., Osborne and Rubinstein 1990, Chapter 4).

We conclude that, even when we look only at steady states, the diﬀerent bargaining
solutions generally give diﬀerent answers with nonlinear utility. Again, we like our solution
because it has a simple strategic foundation, in and out of steady state, we want to look out
of steady state because we are interested in nonstationary bubbles, and we need nonlinear
utility to get bubbles. That is why we used this bargaining solution, but other solutions can
also generate interesting dynamics in our model of intermediated trade.

Conclusion

We studied trade intermediated by middlemen, and potentially chains of middlemen. We
presented a model of this activity and a discussion of various economic issues. This included
a comparison of buyers vs sellers, and goods vs money vs transferrable utility, that emerged
from our reading of two distinct branches of search theory, one on middlemen and one on
money. It is not surprising the models in these literatures are related, given middlemen and
money both exist to facilitate the process of exchange; it is perhaps surprising there is so little
connection between the literatures. We think our analysis helps clarify the similarities and
diﬀerences between existing theories, which is, after all, something scientists are supposed to
do. We also raised some new issues, by analyzing the possible length of intermediation chains,
by pursuing the notion of bargaining with bargainers and the implied holdup problems,
by comparing diﬀerent bargaining solutions in and out of steady state, and by explicitly
constructing equilibria with bubbles. We also think these models can be applied to many
substantive topics in finance, real estate and other areas, but we leave this to future research.

Consider a mixed-strategy equilibrium where σ 1 ∈ (0, 1) and V1 = 0. For convenience,

Σ(n1 ) < 1, there exists a unique (n∗ , σ ∗ ) ∈ (n1 , 1) × (0, 1) such that σ(n∗ ) = Σ(n∗ ) = σ∗ .
We claim that Σ(1) > 0 if and only if g(c1 ) ≥ c2 and Σ(n1 ) < 1 if and only if h(c1 ) ≤ c2 at
n = n1 . See Figure 11. The best response conditions for μ = 1 and σ 2 = 1 are not binding
in this case. This completes the argument. ¥

Appendix B
Here we give some more details concerning the example with U(y) =

√
y. First, we can

extend the case of our bargaining solution by relaxing the assumption c = 0 made in the
35

text. One can show search is viable if and only if Q(γ) ≥ 0, where Q(·) is the quadratic
Q(γ) = −γ 2 [r2 + 2rα + α2 θ] + γ[α2 θ − 2 (r + α) c] − c2 .
Hence, ∃c̄ > 0 such that c < c̄ implies search is viable for γ ∈ [γ 1 , γ 2 ], with 0 < γ 1 < γ 2 ; and
for c > c̄ search is not viable for any γ ≥ 0. As c → 0, [γ 1 , γ 2 ] → [0, γ̄] consistent with (27).
√

Now consider the FOC from generalized Nash bargaining, θy = θV − (1 − θ)[ y − γ]2 y.
Substituting V and rearranging terms, the steady state y solves
√
(2 − θ) (r + α) y − [2γ(1 − θ) (r + α) + αθ] y + cθ = 0.
The solution satisfies
[2γ(1 − θ) (r + α) + αθ] +

y into the viability condition γ ≤ (αU − c) / (r + α) and simplifying, we

have
γ 2 [r2 (2 − θ) + 2rα + α2 θ] + γ{[r(2 − θ) + α]2c − α2 θ} + (2 − θ)c2 ≤ 0.
Again there exists c̄ > 0 such that c < c̄ implies search is viable for γ ∈ [γ 1 , γ 2 ], with
0 < γ 1 < γ 2 ; and for c > c̄ search is not viable for γ ≥ 0.
One can do the same for Kalai’s proportional bargaining solution. At steady state,

and the viability condition is
γ 2 (r + α)2 θ + γ{2θc (r + α) + α[r(1 − θ) − θα]} + c[θc + α(1 − θ)] ≤ 0.
Again, search is viable if and only if c is small.
When c = 0, the upper bounds for γ that allow search are as given in the text. Algebra
implies γ n ≤ γ s < 1 and γ k < 1, while the relationship between γ k and the others is
ambiguous. When c = 0 and r = 0, γ n = γ s = γ k = 1 independent of θ, and U is given by
