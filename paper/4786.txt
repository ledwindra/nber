EFFECFIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT
POLICY: AN EXPERIENCE FROM A
NATIONAL HEALTh CARE SYSTEM

ABSTRACT
This paper examines the trade-off between the length of treatment days and the units of
service provided per thy for elderly patients in the context of the initiative taken by the Ministry
of Health and Welfare of Japan to discourage lengthy hospital treatment and/or stay by elderly
patients. By using three leading diseases among the elderly in Japan (cancer, heart related
disease and mental illness) and separating care utilization into an episode by types of treatment,
our results suggest that the government measures function but they do not effectively work to
reduce increases in medical expenditures by the elderly under the fee-for-service basis. The
evidence shows the interdependency between days and quantity of services, and the larger impact
of services on days than days on services. Providers are more able to raise their revenue by
additional services, than by additional tieaunent days, under the government's current cost
containment policy toward the elderly cart. For the so-called skilled type of treatment services
(injection, general treatment, consultation and operation), the results on all elderly ages 65 and
over without disease classification show some statistically significant positive impact on length
of treatment in days and quantity of services provided per day. For the so-called material type
of service (medication and examination), medical service providers are likely to prescribe more

dnigs as the price of drugs falls under the current strict drug price control by the Japanese
governmenL

I Introduction
At present, the United States and Japan along with most other

industrialized countries are facing an aging society.

The

percentage of Japanese aged 65 and over is currently 13 percent and

is expected to reach 17 percent by the year 2000 and 25 percent by

2025. A recent increase in the aging population significantly
affects national medical care expenditures in Japan. Medical care

expenditures for the elderly have increased faster than national
medical expenditures, and the ratio of these expenditures for the
elderly to national medical care expenditures have been constantly

rising (Table 1).

Elderly receiving medical care services

increased 4.0 percent per year on average since the early 1980s.

The rapid increase in medical care expenditures attracts
researchers to focus on cost containment strategies (Butler, 1991;

Garrison, 1991; Newhouse, 1993) .

Traditional

cost analysis

typically focuses on the institutional sector, rather than on
episode (Custer, Moser, Musacchio and Wilike, 1990; Wedig 1993).

It suppresses information on the intensity of utilization of
service treatment within an episode. Medical service treatment
within an episode can better depict a central measure of cost than
in an institutional setting on a sector-by-sector basis. However,

an episode of treatment is often defined conceptually as a bundle

of services given during a period of continuous contact. In this

paper, by separating care utilization into episodes by types of
treatment, we will analyze variation of treatments and information,

and deduce important policy implications. Furthermore this paper
1

sheds light on the elderly's medical cost (i.e., medical
expenditures) on disease structures with various types of
treatments in the national health insurance framework, rather than

in an institutional setting at the market sector level. Thus, by

controlling for type of episode, the analysis can generate more
precise estimates of the cost structures in the aging society.
The objective of this paper is to find a relationship between

medical service provisions for the elderly and related national
policy. We will assess whether the intention of the Ministry of
Health and Welfare, by lowering the reimbursement for the medical

care, discourages lengthy hospital stays by elderly people and

constrains the quantity of services under

the

National Health

Insurance system in Japan. Thus, we will examine the trade off
between length of treatment, and quantity of services provided by

medical service providers. In addition, we will also analyze the
linkage between the change in the government reimbursement price

types of services, and the so-called skilled types of services
(injection, general treatment, consultation and operation) and the
material type of services (medication and examination) under
for

Japanese

medical pricing system with a fee-for-service basis. The

paper analyzes three leading diseases among the elderly: cancer,

heart related diseases and mental illness.'

related diseases cause the highest

Cancer and heart

rate of death and

hospitalization among the elderly in Japan. Mental illness has
recently been increasing as life expectancy of elderly people rises

and has gradually increased its share of medical expenditures in
2

Table 2. Medical expenditures on cancer and heart related disease

dominate, with expenditures on mental disease being third, along
with other diseases such as musculoskeletal and digestive organic
diseases for elderly age 65 and over.

The organization of the paper is as follows.

Section II

presents a brief summary of the historical background of the

Japanese medical care system for the elderly.

Section iii

describes the conceptual framework and methodology. The empirical

results are presented in Section IV and are followed by the
conclusion in Section V.

II Historical Background of Medical Care System for the Elderly
In 1963 the Welf are Law for the Elderly was established to
provide physical examinations for elderly people. The Medical Care

Expendituze Payment System was enacted in 1973.

Its free care

system, in which copayments of the elderly were paid by the
government, resulted in too frequent medical treatment and caused
quick expansion in government expenditures on medical services for

the elderly. The average annual percentage change in medical care
expenditures was 18 percent until the Health Service System for the

Elderly was established in 1983. The previous system also created
an imbalance in the burden between the elderly who were covered by

Employees' Health Insurance and the Community Based National
Insurance. However, the previous system enabled elderly people to
have access to medical care services, and provided needed medical

care service for them.

The present cost-sharing system, health
3

service system, for the elderly, still presents the imbalance of

the burden shared among different health insurers. The present

system could reduce the skyrocketing increase in medical
expenditures of the elderly experienced since 1983. Currently the

elderly bear certain minimal portion of cost with the remaining
costs jointly paid by the national (20%) ,

state

(5%) and local (5%)

governments and the insurers of medical care insurance systems
(70%)

The insurance system for the elderly consists of five insurers

under government supervision. Government-managed Health Insurance

covers employees at place of work (mainly small and medium size
enterprises)

where no social-managed Health Insurance

is

established. Social-managed Health Insurance covers employees at

places of work (mainly large enterprises and employees in
enterprises 300 and over) where Social-managed Health Insurance is

established. Seamen's Insurance covers seamen, those on defined
vessels.

Mutual Aid Associations are national public service

employees, local public service employees, and private school
teachers and employees. National Insurance covers people who are

not covered by employees insurance (farmers, self-employed,
carpenters, doctors, employees of small businesses, etc.) and
retirees formerly under employees' insurance plus dependents. In
1991 about seventy percent of 15.592 million elderly belonged to

National Insurance and eighteen percent of them were general
employees under Government-managed Health Insurance. The remaining

twelve percent belonged to Social-managed Health Insurance,
4

Seamen's Insurance and Mutual Aid Associations.

Table 3 shows

these insurers recent share of medical care expenditures by the
elderly.

Medical service providers follow the reimbursement scheme by
the point system which is set by the Ministry of Health and Welfare

of Japan.

The unified point system is applied to all medical

service providers, regardless of the types of health insurance.
The role of the point system is to generate enough revenue to cover

costs incurred. Each item of medical service is assigned a certain

number of points, and providers are reimbursed a sum of total
points multiplied by 10 yen (approximately 9 cents assuming one

dollar equals 102 yen) under the fee-for-service system.

The

services consist of thirteen types of treatments: medication,

injection, examination, hospital service, general treatment,
radiology, mental treatment; anesthesia, basic consultation, home

care, image diagnosis, operation and physiotherapy.

Table 4

presents the relative importance of different types of service for

the elderly in total amount of reimbursement to medical service
providers per claim. The share pattern is different for the three

types of leading diseases. There is no systematic differences in

treatment cost. Hospital services are remarkably important for
mental illness patients, followed by heart related disease and
cancer.

In cancer, injection and hospital services dominate the

share. For medication, mental illness and heart related disease

have a relatively larger share than cancer.

Regarding the

reimbursement for skilled type of treatment services (injection,
5

general treatment, consultation and operation) ,

general

treatment

and consultation are higher for heart related disease than in the

case of cancer, while operation is higher for cancer than heart
related disease.

In mental illness, skilled types of treatment

services (operation and consultation) play a smaller role than
general treatment.

Japanese reimbursement price is based on the point system
which is classified into thirteen service categories: medication,

injection, examination, hospital service, general treatment,
radiology, mental treatment, anesthesia, basic consultation, home

care, image diagnosis, operation and physiotherapy.

In these

groups there are further classificatipns. For example an initial

consultation is 195 points (1 point=10 yen) and 450 points with
referrals; nursing at hospital is 318 points; injection ranges from

15 to 150. points, depending on skill required; medication is 1
point per 15 yen purchasing material price plus prescription which

is 74 points per unit. These changes in points are dependent on

whether the patients are children, adult or elderly, degree of

skill required, quantity of material and patient's length of
treatment. The government reimbursement price consists of these
complicated pricing classifications on a fee-for-service basis.

Abe (1983) intensively analyzes the Japanese point system and
discusses a lack of strict internal control by medical service
providers who create a failure to perform efficiently.

In this

study we use a price of each type of service in thirteen
classifications of types of services.
6

III Analytical Framework
For utilization of treatments, medical service providers have

dual roles.

They act as if they were not only the patient's

advisors but also as income optimizers for their own interest. In

the latter role, suppose that medical service providers have an
incentive for optimizing their target revenue under a fee-f orservice basis in a national health insurance system.2

If they

target a certain revenue, there exists a trade off between a length

of treatment in days and quantity of services per day within a
given target revenue, and they reveal characteristics of treatment
within an episode. We note that service utilization not only rises

rapidly near the terminal period but also the last days of
physician and hospital services have less resource utilization than

the first days. It is plausible that a fall in the average length
of treatments by the government containment policy may increase the

resource intensity per day under the fee-for-service basis. A rise

in the amount of reimbursement per day, namely medical care
expenditures, depends on the average utilization of services per
day and the last day's marginal change in the resource intensity.

Thus, we will examine this trade off between treatment days and
quantity of services provided and look at different treatments for
cancer, heart related disease and mental illness for the elderly.

We evaluate how the government reimbursement price affects the
length of treatment for a disease and quantity of services provided

by hospitals for the elderly, especially the difference between
skilled and material services.
7

A disease requires different types of treatment services
within an episode. A cost of each treatment service is reimbursed

by the government.

In this section we try to conceptualize

a

relationship between a reimbursement price by the government and

medical service providers in a generalized framework.3

Suppose

that a reimbursement price by the government to medical care
service providers:Pr, is expressed as,

= l'mS +

0 c s <

1,

where m denotes a market price under the competitive market among
the health and medical service providers, "s" stands for a subsidy

rate by the government, Pms is government subsidy through medical

service providers. The government subsidy with a fee-for-service
system tends to induce medical service providers to provide more
medical services to patients and create induced demand for medical

service:Q, not quantity demanded (Feldstein, 1993) .

A choice of

medical service is determined by providers, not patients.
Providers will be guided by their efficiency and treatment prices

which affect their revenue. Under the existing national health
care system, current demand curve for health and medical services
already stays on the right side of a demand curve, D, compared to

D0 which is without government involvement in Figure 1.

Thus, a

one unit increase in demand for health and medical service results.

in an increase in a price which depends on the slope of supply
curve. Each percentage increase in Q that raises the market price
of medical service, resulting in a net change in price due to a one

unit increase in medical care is expressed as
8

2

=

1/Q•Pm1/E.

An absolute rise in the price (ÔP,/aQ) is equal to a medical price
per service multiplied by 1/c which is an inverse of an elasticity

of supply of medical service. Then, the total price is expressed
as, OP/ÔQ + m• Japan's point system is itemized pricing with feefor-service and providers may be encouraged or may generate revenue

to cover the total cost. It provides more individualized care and
requires different resources for treatment. Thus, the intention of

the government's point system is to encourage efficient use of
medical resources and it depends on the optimal size of government

subsidy which in turn influences revenue of medical service
providers. An

equilibrium

subsidy rate, given a supply of medical

service curve, is derived from equations 1 and 2. We obtain

s = (OPm/ÔQ) (1/Pm)

where the subsidy rate is a rate of change in 2m with respect to Q.

national health care system in Figure 1.

A demand curve D0

represents the original demand curve without the national health
care system, while D' is the current demand curve with the national

health care system. The equilibrium point moves from e to e1. The

population currently enjoys a higher level of consumption of
medical services at 01.

The national health care system provides

comprehensive health and medical services for the population. It
improves health status of people, and in turn extends the amount of

time of available to people for daily activities because a decrease

in the number of sick days will increase the time available for
9

socio-economic activities such as work, leisure and others. Thus,

the system raises the economic value of human resources and
permeates benefits to others through a provision of health and

medical services in the society (Grossman 1972a and 197Th)
Therefore, the external benefits to others in the society emerges.

This quasi-society's benefit is expressed by marginal social
benefit

curve:

(MSB=OPm/OQ=Pm

NSA,

which

is

marginal

social

benefits

s) in Figure 1.

A government

subsidy largely depends on a slope of supply of

medical services curve.

The current supply curve, namely a

marginal cost curve, depends on and is determined by efficient use

of medical input resources. Given the government reimbursement
price, suppose that a medical service provider has a target at a
certain revenue. Let's consider a representative medical service
provider whose preferences are generated by the utility function
(Wedig, 1993), as
4

U = 11(R),

U'> 0 and U"c 0.

U is the utility derived from a medical service revenue,R. Revenue

is an additively separable revenue function and is defined as
S

R

rQ(QisQa),

where Q and Q9 are a length of treatment and quantity of services
provided, respectively. This separation is theoretically proved by
Coyte (1985) ,

and he explicitly discusses medical service providers

as utility maximizers. For a dual role assumption, providers act

according to a patient's financial and medical interests as
decision makers, and also act as their own utility maximizers who
10

target an optimization of total revenue. A provider's Optimized

revenue is obtained by differentiating the total revenue with
respect to both types of care provided, and we obtain as,
6

MR = AR1[ 1 +

+ ARS( 1 +

(l/c)],

MRO

where MR is a marginal revenue, AR is an average revenue of a

length of stay:1, and of a quantity of service:s, and

is

a

government reimbursement price elasticity of a length of stay:e1,

and of a quantity of service:c. Japan's point system, i.e. the

government reimbursement price, has an important role for the
medical service providers and influences on quantitative decision
of medical services. Especially the fee-for-service system induces

the providers to perform a dual role. We will analyze the role of
the government reimbursement price and its influence on the medical

service providers with Japan's point system under the national
health insurance framework.

Let's suppose T is a target-evenue margin per unit as markups over cost.
7

T =

It is expressed as follows

- MC)/Prv

where MC is the marginal cost of medical service provided, and r

is the government reimbursement price. A smaller gap between P,

and MC represent a more competitive market (Hoerger, 1990)
Therefore T tends to be small. Under an optimal condition from
equations 6 and 7, we obtain as,

theoretical framework of optimization (Pauly, 1987)

Equation 9

presents the following interesting implications in a provision of

medical service under the current national health care system.
Given an equilibrium quantity of medical services,

It implies that a large

subsidy relative to a market price (namely a subsidy rate: s) will
be required with an inelastic steep curve. It is shown by e1e3/e301

with a relatively steep marginal curve: MC in Figure 1. Hence a
medical service provider targets a high level of T because of an
increase in the level of r

with

given level of m and quantity of

medical service. An inelastic MC" requires the government to spend

a relatively large amount of subsidy: e1e3, to maintain national
medical services at Q level, while an elastic marginal cost curve:

requires a lower amount of the government subsidy: e2e3 in
Figure 1. Put differently, the government reimbursement price is
proportionally higher than the market price which does not involve
MC,

the government in provisions for medical care services.

Thus

efficiency in producing medical service by providers is important
to achieving cost containment policy.

(2) A more elastic MC of medical service in Figure 1, is implied

small 1/c = sQ at the equilibrium level of medical service. A
small subsidy rate: s, induces medical service providers to target
a low rate of T because of a little change in r• In this case the
a

reimbursement price is small proportionally and relatively to a
market price, in turn the government spending on health and medical
12

service declines.

(3) A situation of a small gap between T and r may force to
medical service providers to lower marginal cost:MC, namely more
efficient production of medical service.

we have discussed the implication of

the government

reimbursement price on behavior of targeting revenue by medical
service providers. Our concern is that the objective of medical
service providers as optimizers is to target a certain level of
total revenue under the fee-for-service system.

In this case a

change in the government reimbursement price affects medical
service providers who control quantity of medical care services
such as a length of treatment in days and/or number at units of
service per day. Art assumption of our target revenue hypothesis is
that medical service providers maintain their actual total revenue.

The following equations derived from equation 8 allows us to
analyze precisely how different service treatment affects length of

treatment in days and quantity of service provided.

and Q1

and Q are also

simultaneously determined.

To understand the relationship between medical service
provision for the elderly and the governments point of view of
health care needs among different treatments within an episode, we

will investigate the impacts of reimbursement price of various
treatment services on length of treatment in days and number of

units of service, and examine these relationships regarding an
existence of trade off between treatment in days and quantity of

services provided per day within an episode.

The length of

treatment in days and number of units of service treated per day
employed within the context of this paper are estimated as,

(A) DAY

f(SERVICE, PRICE) +

and
(B) SERVICE =

I WAY, PRICE) +

where DAY is length of treatment in days for treatment, SERVICE is
number of units of service provided per day, and PRICE which is
prices of various treatment received by medical serviôe providers
through the health care system represents a unit price for a type
of service.

The to

in

(A) and (3) are stochastic error terms,

because there are components of length of treatment in days for
treatment and number of units of service per day that are affected
by unmeasured factors. To test interdependency between a length of

treatment days and quantity of services per day we employ a system

of simultaneous equations by a two-stage-least-squares estimation
procedure.

14

IV Empirical results
The data used to estimate the models A and B is based on the
Shakai Jryo Shiryo Koibetsu Chosa Houkoku 1989-1991 which is based
on aggregated monthly financial report in June for each year and is

compiled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. This aggregate
data contains thirteen disease classifications, for which we choose
the three leading types of diseases (48 observations for cancer, 54

for heart related disease and 48 for mental illness) and all
elderly people without disease classification (120 observations)
The data contains thirteen types of treatment services with number

of claims, services and the amount of government reimbursement.

The data does not classify male and female difference regarding

length of treatment in days and units of service provided. We
integrate two important health insurances (Government-managed
Health Insurance and National Insurance) and age classification of

65-69 and 70- into the estimation of all elderly people without

disease classification. But we are not able to integrate these
variables for the estimation of each disease (cancer, heart relate

disease and mental illness) because of inadequate data regarding

disease classification among the elderly in this publicly open
data. Thus, the study on all elderly people examines the effect of
the National Insurance and the Government-managed Health Insurance

on medical service providers' behavior for the care of elderly by

using a dummy variable along with an age dummy variable without
disease classification.

The data does not contain information

about providers' and patients' characteristics. Thus, we await the
15

availability of micro-level data to the public to get further
insight.

Table S presents the definition of variables.

Means and

standard deviation are reported in Tables 6 (three leading diseases

among the elderly) and 7 (all elderly people aged 65 and over
without disease classification) .

Tables 8 (three leading diseases

among the elderly) and 9 (all elderly people aged 65 and over
without disease classification) present the result of estimated
effects of reimbursement prices on number of days of treatment and

units service per day. We employ various government reimbursement
prices as exogenous variables with controlling quantity measures:

an amount of services and length of treatment in days. Regarding
medical-service quality control as Fahs (1985) discusses medical
services by physicians, this study has difficulty in controlling
for quality measures because of the characteristics of data. The
use of conditional indexes for the detection of multicollinearity
is required. The results of conditional indexes are less than 5.5

and variance of inflation factors are less than 4. We conclude

that there exists no harmful multicollinearity problem.

The

equation for cancer (Table 8) is overidentified. The equations for

heart related disease (Table 8), mental illness (Table 8) and all
elderly people (Table 9) are identified. And, we examined the rank

and order of conditions for all of them. The conditions of all

procedure we employ two-stage least squares, and Tables 8 and 9
report estimation results as elasticity term5.
16

The coefficients of primary interest (treatment days and
services) are statistically significant for cancer, heart related
disease and mental illness, and all of them are negative in Table

8. The results seem to be consistent with our prior hypothesis,
i.e. inverse relationship between services and treatment days. In

cancer a 1 percent increase in services will lead to a 1.515
percent decrease in days, while a 1 percent increase in treatment

days will lead to a 0.426 percent decrease in services per day.
For cancer treatment, the marginal impact of units of service per

day on treatment in days is a net change of 17,150 yen ($168.14)
for medical service providers and the marginal impact of treatment
days on services per day is 3,634 yen ($35.63) ..'

Put differently,

the providers gain more revenue by increasing units of services,
rather than by increasing treatment days for patients. Because the

of services is greater than the impact of induced change in
a treatment day. If the providers increase per day treatment, they
lose revenue, and vice versa. Again the impact of per day
impact

treatment is smaller than the impact of induced change in per day
services.

Under the fee-for-service system the medical service

providers are easily able to raise quantity of services to treat
elderly patients. However, the objective of the Ministry of Health.

of Welf are which is to discourage a lengthy stay of an elderly

patient by lowering reimbursement price is functioning.

This

causes the providers to loose their revenue by the lower
reimbursement price, when the length of treatment in days for the
elderly patients rises regardless of a change in controlled days or
17

of an induced day change. But the results show that the medical
providers would not lose by increasing additional services because
positive net gain is about 13,516 (17,150-3,634) yen per day, when
the quantity of services rises regardless of a change in controlled

services or of an induced services change.

For the Ministry of

Health and Welfare to rein lengthy hospital stays by the elderly
patients, this empirical study finds that

the

shorter the hospital

stay of an elderly patient, the larger the amount of additional
services.

Our results show that the government objective

effectively functions. However the medical expenditures by the
government for the elderly patients do not decline under the feefor-service system in the national health insurance framework. In

addition the quantity of services is a larger influence on cost
saving than on treatment days from the view of the government.
In cc,mparison to cancer, in the case of heart related disease,

the estimated coefficient of treatment days is less elastic while
that of services is more elastic. A 1 percent increase in services

will tend to lower treatment days by a 0.9776 percent, and a 1
percent increase in the days will lower quantity of services by a
0.5375 percent. It is also notable that the impact of services on

treatment days contributes 17,047 yen ($167.13) which is very
similar to the amount in the case of cancer, while impact of days

on services contributes only 7,516 yen ($73.69) which is however

twice as large in the cancer case. t increase in services for
heart related disease will again raise medical cost, by a large
amount, namely, expenditures of the government (directly) ,
18

and

consumers (indirectly through taxation) .

This

is because in spite

of the inverse relationship between days and services, an increase
in the amount of government reimbursement by the medical providers

raising the amount of services dominates the amount of the
government reimbursement caused by a decline in treatment days for

elderly patients. For mental illness, although the gain is small
amount of 833 yen ($8.17), the result of mental illness also leads
the similar conclusion.

In Table 9 the results of negative sign presents the inverse
relationship between treatment days and amount of services provided

per day for all elderly patients. The effect of services on days
has a larger impact than that of days on services. Under the fee-

for-service system in the national health insurance, medical
service providers may easily raise their revenue through additional

services, not by additional treatment days. Our results provide

evidence for this important result, however further careful

empirical testing is necessary to generalize the inverse
relationship,namely trade off, between treatment days and quantity

of services provided, and to measure the initiative taken by the
Ministry....of Health and Welfare of Japan regarding the lengthy
hospital stays by the elderly patients.

Tuning attention to the effect of government reimbursement

price on treatment days and services, we do not examine all
thirteen types of treatments in the same manner for three types of
diseases because physiotherapy is close to zero and less important

for cancer but not for heart related disease as Table 4 shows.
19

Mental treatment is almost zero share for the heart related
disease.

The radiology services are almost zero for the heart

related disease and mental illness in our data sources.

In both

cancer and heart related disease our interesting finding from the

results in Table 8 is that material types of service treatments,
such as R.medication and R.examination, show negative signs and are

statistically significant while skilled type service treatments,
such as R.consultation, R.operation, R.injection, R.physiotherapy

and R.treatment(general), are positively and statistically
significant except R.treatment variable for cancer.
In cancer and heart related disease in Table S material types

of R.medication and R.examination are negative. It is interesting
to note that the negative signs for R.medication and R.examination

are not congruent with alleged statement of excessive drugs and
diagnostic, examinations by the Japanese medical service providers.

For example a 1 percent increase in R.medication will lower a
0.1787 percent for cancer days and a 0.4443 percent of days for
heart related disease. In R.examination a 1 percent increase in
the government reimbursement price will lower 0.168 percent days
for cancer and 0.3819 percent days for heart related disease.
Unlike cancer and heart related disease the results of mental

illness show that R.medication as material type of service
treatment tends to have lengthy hospital stays and additional
service treatments. This seems to reflect the characteristics of

the illness. A 1 percent rise in R.medication will increase a
0.3975 percent of days and a 0.2449 percent of services for mental
20

illness patients.

These results are different from cancer and

heart related disease. The results of R.rnental (mental treatment)
and R.consultation (skilled type of service) indicate the negative

relationship between reimbursement price, and treatment days and
services.

A change in government reimbursement price does not

reveal a systematic effect of skilled and material types of
services on the length of treatment and quantity of services
provided per day.

However distinction seems to exist between

cancer and heart related disease, and mental illness.

Another

note-worthy finding is that the estimated coefficients in Table 9

indicate that skilled types of services (injection, general
treatment, consultation and operation) tend to show statistically

significant positive sign.

And

again

R.medication shows the negative sign.

the coefficient of

From this result we may

deduce tha,t the current strict drug price control by the government

induces the medical service providers to prescribe more drugs for
elderly patients as the price declines (Newhouse, 1993).

Most of the estimated elasticities of the government
reimbursement price are inelastic except R.radiology for cancer and

R.hospital for days of heart related disease. Put differently,
length of treatments and quantity of services provided per day are

insensitive to the government reimbursement price regardless of
qualitative signs.

As for positive case, an increase in the

government reimbursement price will present incentive to medical

service providers to induce more specific types of service
treatment, say physiotherapy, to the elderly patients of heart
21

related disease. A large increase in the government reimbursement

price will be required to increase the treatment of physiotherapy
to cover needs for elderly patients. As for negative case, a large

decrease in the government reimbursement price has a small impact

on a change in quantity, and the government is able to reduce a
large amount of health and medical care expenditure on material

type of service treatments, such as medication and diagnostic
examination, by reducing the government reimbursement price.

The National Insurance and the Government-managed Health
Insurance cover about 88% of the elderly people under the National

Health Insurance System.

The result of Insurance.D in Table 9

indicates the medical service providers treat the patient of
National Insurance with fewer treatment days (about 1.1 days at the

sample mean) and quantity of services per day (about 1.4 units at
the sample mean) compared to those of the Government-managed Health

Insurance. It is alleged that people under the community based
National Insurance, i.e. farmers, self-employed and employees of

small business, are inferior in health status than those of the
employee based Government-managed Health Insurance. If it is true,

our result is not congruent with adduced statement. Because the
length of treatment and quantity of services are provided more to
the Government-managed Health Insurance patients. Further careful

empirical study is necessary to test the allegation. The positive
Age.D in Table 9 suggests that longer treatment days is attributed

to an increase in age. The elderly age 70 and over are treated
about one day longer than the elderly age 65-69 at the sample mean.
22

Regarding the effect on quantity of service provided per day, it is

positive but weak.
We are interested in the costs of these three types of leading

diseases in Japan and we have a proximity of loss of economic
indirect cost (loss of own earning) and direct health and medical

cost by the elderly age 65 and over in 1991.'

In cancer for a

month, economic indirect costs are about 5.59 billion yen ($54.8
million: $l=lO2yen) , and health and medical costs are about 68.201

billion yen ($668.6 million) .

In

heart related disease for a

month, economic indirect costs are 30.86 billion yen ($302.5
million), and health and medical costs are 257.497 billion yen
($2.524 billion) .

In mental

illness for a month, economic indirect

costs are 0.46 billion yen ($4.5 million), and health and medical
costs are 26.43 billion yen ($259 million) .

We note that summing

these figures still underestimates total loss of costs caused by

three leading diseases of the elderly age 65 and over.

For

comparison purpose, we tentatively calculate and compare it with

the gross national product in 1991.

The total cost of three

leading diseases: 4,668.456 billion yen ($45.77 billion), is about

0.3 percent of the gross national product in 1991.

V. Conclusion

This paper examines the trade off between the length of

treatment in days and units of service provided per day for
elderly patients in the context of the initiative taken by the

Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan to discourage lengthy
23

hospital treatment and/or stay by the elderly patients.

By

separating disease care utilization into an episode by types of

treatment, our results suggest that the government measures
function but it does not effectively work to reduce increasing
medical expenditures by the elderly under the fee-for-service basis

in the National Health Care system.

The evidence of the three

leading diseases (cancer, heart related disease and mental illness)

by the elderly shows the interdependency between days and quantity
of services and the larger impact of services on days than days on

services. The medical service providers are easily able to raise
their revenue by additional services, not by additional treatment
days, under the government current cost containment policy toward
the elderly care.

The skilled type of treatment services (injection, general
treatment,

consultation and operation) do not show clear

distinction among types of disease as prices of service change.

However, the results from all elderly age 65 and over without
disease classification show some statistically significant positive

impact by skilled types of service treatments on length of
treatment in days and quantity of services provided per day. The

material type of treatment service (medication and examination)

have a negative effect on the length of treatment in days and
quantity of services in cancer and heart related disease, but
positive effect in mental illness. we find that our results are

not congruent with alleged excessive drug and diagnostic
examination by the medical service providers. However, they are
24

likely to prescribe more drugs as the price of drugs fall under the

current strict drug price control by the Japanese government. Our
result also indicates that the elderly patients under the community

based National Insurance receive shorter length of treatment in
days and quantity of services per day than the patients under the
employee based Government-managed Health Insurance. These results

suggest further careful study to assess the government measures,
i.e. the objective by the Ministry of Health and Welfare to reduce
the lengthy hospital treatment and/or stay by the elderly patients.

It is interesting to note that length of treatment in days
and units service per day are not very responsive to changes in the

government reimbursement prices. The results indicate that large
health care expenditures are generally required to expand each type

of treatment to promote health status for the elderly in Japan.

These leading diseases by the elderly: cancer, heart related
disease and mental illness, cost about 0.3 percent of the GNP in

1991 although the figure is proximity of loss of indirect- and
direct costs by the elderly age 65 and over.

The meaning of target revenue by medical providers in this
study is different from "target income hypothesis of physician
pricing" which suggests that with an increase in the number of
physicians, physicians will increase both their prices and their
demand to provide themselves with a target income. Note there are
three other types of hypotheses of hospital behavior which are
different from our context: (1) a profit maximizing model which
assumes that a nonprofit hospital acts as though it were a forprof it hospital but returns its profit to the community; (2) a
utility maximizing model assumes that hospitals act as if they
wanted to maximize their output or revenue, and they invest either
in additional capacity, cost-saving technology or facilities in
order to increase output or revenue; (3) a physician-control model
2.

assumes that physicians are the beneficiaries of nonprofit
hospitals and the model suggests that with increased demand for
medical services in the community, physicians would favor an
increase in their hospitals' capacity so as to increase their
productivity which in turn increases their incomes.
3.

The results obtained by Coyte (1985) do not differ from a

distinction made between hospital managers (entrepreneurs) and the

specialists (i.e. physicians) employed. In Japan physicians are
heavily involved in decision making in hospitals. In this study
medical services providers mean both physicians and hospitals.

The revenue function is an additively separable function.
There exists substitution between the length of treatment and
quantity service provided, and the revenue from both cares are
additive.

Kmenta (1986) and Green (1993) intensively discuss the

conditional requirements to perform the simultaneous equations. The

model of equations should be identified.
In the model of
simultaneous equation in this study,
the order condition of
identifiability and the rank condition were examined. And both
conditions are satisfied. The instrumental variables which we use

are variables of reimbursement prices, total claims per month,
total government reimbursement of medication, operation, hospital,

The calculation is based on Tables 8 and 10 as,

a) an impact of services on treatment days =

(coefficient

of

services(=elasticity) x (mean of day/mean of services) x amount of

per day government reimbursement] - (amount of the government
reimbursement per unit x mean of per day units services)
b) an impact of treatment days on services =

(coefficient

of days

services] - amount of per day government reimbursement.
We use an exchange rate $l=l02 yenin this paper. Readers are
required to be cautious of interpretation because we do not use
"purchasing power parity" for this simple estimation.
7.

Because of data availability we have not estimated the loss of

complete direct and indirect costs, such as care giver's market

opportunity costs, patients' waiting time, and expenditures of
elderly in nursing homes which are in the very early stages in
Japan. Waiting time costs by patients,especially in Japan, is an
important factor in ascessing loss of human time (Yarnada and
Yamada, 1993), and Feldstein (1998) intensively discuss time costs

for traveling to a provider and for waiting for treatment. The
calculation is based on average labor force participation for men
27

and women age 65 and over considering full- and part-time workers,

and average monthly salary for men and women is based on the
assumption that they are full-time workers and these cancer, heart
