ABSTRACT
During the first two decades of the 20th century, diarrheal deaths among American infants and
children surged every summer. Although we still do not know what pathogen (or pathogens)
caused this phenomenon, the consensus view is that it was eventually controlled through public
health efforts at the municipal level. Using data from 26 major American cities for the period
1910-1930, we document the phenomenon of summer diarrhea and explore its dissipation. We
find that water filtration is associated with a 15-17 percent reduction in diarrheal mortality among
children under the age of two during the non-summer months, but does not seem to have had an
effect on diarrheal mortality during the summer. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that
public health interventions undertaken at the municipal level contributed to the dissipation of
summer diarrhea. Our results are relevant for many parts of the developing world today, where
climate change is expected to affect the length and intensity of seasons as well as the incidence of
diarrheal diseases.

1. INTRODUCTION
Summer diarrhea (also known as “cholera infantum” or the “disease of the season”) was
first described in the medical literature by Benjamin Rush (1794). According to Rush (1794, p.
160), it would sometimes begin “with a diarrhoea, which can last for several days without any
other symptom...but it more frequently comes on with a violent vomiting and purging, and a high
fever.” He argued that it was likely caused by the “discharge of bile which generally introduces
the disease…and exacerbations of the fever which accompanies it…” (Rush 1794, p. 163).
By the turn of the 20th century, physicians had gained a better understanding of how
gastronomical diseases are contracted but still had not discovered why thousands of American
infants and children were dying of diarrhea every summer. In fact, to this day, we can only
speculate as to precisely what pathogen (or pathogens) caused the phenomenon (Meckel 1990;
Thompson and Keeling 2012).
Economists and historians have argued that summer diarrhea was controlled through the
combined effects of public health interventions (Meckel 1990; Fishback et al. 2011).
Specifically, they point to municipal-level efforts during the early 1900s to purify water and milk
supplies. Because breastfeeding was typically discontinued at an early age (Wolf 2003), and
because there is anecdotal evidence that children were at the greatest risk of dying from diarrhea
in their “second summer” (Condie 1858, p. 224; Moss 1903; Southworth 1904), focusing on
these efforts is not without justification. 1

1

See also Reedy (2007, p. 42), who asserted that summer diarrhea was controlled through “handwashing and safer
food-handling procedures at home and in the marketplace” along with “better built and maintained sewage treatment
plants” that “helped keep infants and children from playing in and drinking contaminated water.” Graham-Smith
(1929) attributed the dissipation of summer diarrhea among infants in England to the introduction of the automobile,
which had the effect of reducing horse manure in the streets.

1

In this study, we begin by documenting the phenomenon of summer diarrhea and its
correlates using newly transcribed mortality data from 26 major American cities for the period
1910-1930. These data, which were originally published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census,
include monthly counts of diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two. We show that
21,000 children under the age of two died of diarrhea in 1910, and 14,000 of these deaths
occurred in the months of June-September. By the end of the period under study, the
phenomenon of summer diarrhea had largely dissipated. Fewer than 4,000 children under the
age of two died of diarrhea in 1930, and fewer than 1,500 of these deaths occurred in the
summer. 2
In the second half of the paper, we use data from these same 26 cities to estimate whether
public health efforts at the municipal level contributed to the waning of summer diarrhea during
the period 1910-1930. 3 We find that the construction of a water filtration plant is associated with
a 15-17 percent reduction in diarrheal mortality during non-summer months, consistent with the
hypothesis that transmission occurred through contaminated water. By contrast, filtration had
little effect on diarrheal mortality during the hottest 4 months of the year (June-September),
which suggests that transmission was most likely through contaminated food or person-to-person
contact, although efforts to purify the milk supply do not appear to have affected diarrheal
mortality during the summer either. In fact, we find little evidence that public health
interventions can explain the waning of summer diarrhea. We conclude that the phenomenon of
summer diarrhea was serious and widespread, but, contrary to the consensus view, its dissipation

2

In 1910, the ratio of diarrheal deaths to the population of children under the age of two was .031 (21,101/678,292
= .031). By 1920, this ratio had dropped to .015; by 1930, it had dropped to .005.

We focus on the period 1910-1930 because monthly-level mortality data are not available from the U.S. Bureau of
the Census prior to 1910 or after 1930.

was not due to municipal-level efforts to purify the milk or water supplies or treat sewage. It is
possible that improvements in the refrigeration chain, better nutrition, or some combination of
these and other factors may have contributed to the dramatic reduction in diarrheal deaths among
American infants and children during the summer months.
The results described above contribute to a literature comprised entirely of descriptive
case studies (Cheney 1984; Condran 1988; Condran and Lentzner 2004). They also have
implications for developing countries today, where climate change is expected to increase the
risk of diarrheal diseases (Gray 2011; Friedrich 2013; Dhimal et al. 2016). 4 In many parts of the
world, diarrheal diseases still exhibit seasonality, although the intensity of this seasonality varies
with region and climate (Patel et al. 2013; Platts-Mills et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2015; Baker 2016).
Understanding the determinants of summer diarrhea and its eventual waning could help identify
effective intervention strategies as the length and intensity of seasons change across the globe
(Kiger 2017; Santer et al. 2018; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2019). 5
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin with an overview of
diarrheal disease and a discussion of the previous literature. In Section 3, we document the
summer diarrhea phenomenon using data on the 26 most populous cities in the United States as
of 1910; in Section 4, we describe our empirical strategy, report our principal estimates, and
consider various robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.

In tropical climates (e.g., Southeast Asian), climate change is expected to intensify already marked seasonal
variation in rainfall (Christensen et al. 2007; Asian Development Bank 2009; Lyon and Camargo 2009), which
could, in turn, exacerbate the incidence of diarrhea.

5

An emerging literature has identified existing technologies that can be used to adapt to climate change (Hsiang and
Narita 2012; Auffhammer and Schlenker 2014; Klein et al. 2014; Barreca et al. 2016).

2. BACKGROUND
Today, diarrheal disease is the second-leading cause of death among children under the
age of 5 (Liu et al. 2015). Between 500,000 and 800,000 children under the age of 5 die of
diarrhea every year, most of whom are born to mothers in developing countries (Liu et al. 2015;
Kovacs et al. 2015). A wide variety of bacteria, parasites and viruses cause diarrhea and other
symptoms of gastroenteritis (Hodges and Gill. 2010). Infection is usually through contaminated
food or water, or person-to-person contact (Pawlowski et al. 2009). In temperate climates,
bacterial infections are more common during the summer (Ramos-Alvarez and Sabin 1958;
Fletcher et al. 2013), while viral gastroenteritis is more common during the winter (Pawlowski et
al. 2009). In tropical climates, the incidence of diarrhea appears to peak during the rainy season
(Zhang et al. 2010; Phung et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2015; Kulinkina et al. 2016; Muluken et al. 2017).
Over 70 percent of total deaths from diarrhea occur among children under of the age of
two (Walker et al. 2013). Susceptibility is highest at 6-11 months, presumably because exclusive
breastfeeding protects against infection and crawling brings children into contact with human
and/or animal feces (Walker et al. 2013; Mduduzi et al. 2015). Death is typically caused by
dehydration and loss of electrolytes (King et al. 2003), although malnutrition is often a
contributing factor (Baqui and Ahmed 2006).

2.1. Previous Literature
In the decades leading up to its dissipation, summer diarrhea received a great deal of
attention from physicians, who described its symptoms, noted that its victims were often born in

4

crowded tenement housing districts, and proposed various causes. 6 For instance, one school of
thought held that exposure to summer heat was directly responsible for the annual wave of
diarrheal deaths among infants and children (Miller 1879; Schereschewsky 1913), while another
held that overfeeding was the cause (Burg 1902; Brennemann 1908; Tilden 1909). Even among
physicians who believed that summer diarrhea was caused by bacteria, there were several
competing theories as to the mode of transmission. 7
Since its dissipation, only a handful of studies have examined the phenomenon of
summer diarrhea. Cheney (1984) focused on the experience of Philadelphia during the period
1869-1921, while Condran (1988) focused on New York City during the period 1870-1919.
These authors noted that infant mortality spiked every summer through the early 1900s, due
principally to diarrheal diseases. By the second decade of the 20th century, the phenomenon of
summer diarrhea had begun to wane in both Philadelphia and New York City, which Cheney
(1984) and Condran (1988) attributed to the purification of municipal milk supplies.
Certainly, many contemporary physicians and public health experts were convinced that
purifying the milk supply was key to reducing diarrheal mortality during the summer. 8 The
refrigeration chain was still missing important links during this period (Rees 2013), and bacteria
such as E. coli and Shigella grow rapidly in warm, moist summer conditions (Winﬁeld and
Groisman 2003; Noor 2013; Girma 2015). It is, however, difficult to rule out the possibility that

Ostheimer (1905), Snyder (1906), Brennemann (1908), Murphy (1908), Tilden (1909), Stoner (1912), and Youmans
and Youmans (1922).

7

Zahorsky (1913, 1918) described the various theories of transmission. Hewitt (1910) and Youmans and Youmans
(1922) argued that houseflies were the principal vector of transmission, a possibility that cannot be dismissed out of
hand (Levine and Levine 1991; Förster et al. 2007).

8

See, for instance, Kiefer (1902), McKee (1902), Park and Holt (1904), Snyder (1906), M’Mechan (1907), Stoner
(1912), and the United States Children’s Bureau (1914).

other public health measures contributed to the observed reduction. For instance, Philadelphia
began the process of delivering filtered water to its residents before 1906 and began treating it
with chlorine in 1910 (Anderson et al. 2018), both of which could have reduced diarrheal
mortality among infants and children during the summer months; New York City began
delivering clean water from the Croton Reservoir to its residents in 1907 and began treating it
with chlorine in 1911 (Anderson et al. 2018).
Condran and Lentzner (2004) used data from Chicago, New Orleans, and New York for
the period 1870-1917 to document the phenomenon of summer diarrhea and its waning. They
found that excess mortality during the summer months fell gradually in these cities after the turn
of the 20th century, but noted that identifying the cause of this phenomenon is made exceedingly
difficult by the large number of public health interventions that were undertaken at the municipal
level. These authors concluded that better sanitation and efforts to purify the milk and water
supplies likely contributed to the decline in summer diarrhea but wrote that no single factor is
“sufficient to understand either the poor life chances of infants in nineteenth-century cities or the
improvements in those chances…” (Condran and Lentzner 2004, p. 352).

3. SUMMER DIARRHEA, 1910-1930
Our focus throughout this study is on diarrheal deaths among children under the age of
two in major American cities, defined as the 26 most populous cities as of 1910. 9 City-level
counts of diarrheal deaths are available by month for the period 1910-1930 from Mortality
Statistics, which was published annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. 10 These counts include

9

These 26 cities are listed in Appendix Table 1.

This data source has been used by other authors interested in the effects of public health interventions on mortality
at the turn of the 20th century (Cutler and Miller 2005, 2018; Beach et al. 2016; Anderson et al. 2018, 2019,

6

deaths due to cholera infantum, colitis, enteritis, enterocolitis, gastroenteritis, summer complaint,
and other similar causes (United States Bureau of the Census 1910).
In 1910, there were 21,101 diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two in the
26 most populous American cities (Figure 1), accounting for 30 percent of total mortality in this
age group. 11 Two-thirds of these deaths occurred in the months of June-September. Between
1910 and 1930, diarrheal mortality fell by 83 percent, to 3,513. The reduction in diarrheal deaths
during the months of June-September was even more pronounced: only 1,482 children under the
age of two died from diarrhea in the summer of 1930, a reduction of almost 90 percent as
compared to the summer of 1910. 12
Figure 2 shows annual diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two per 100,000
population. 13 In 1910, there were 124 diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two per
100,000 population; by 1930, the diarrhea mortality rate had fallen to 14, a reduction of 89
percent. The summer diarrheal mortality rate fell from 82 to 6 over the same period, a reduction
of 93 percent.
Figure 3 shows diarrheal deaths by month among children under the age of two per
100,000 population. It is clear from this figure that seasonality waned considerably during the
period under study. For instance, the diarrhea mortality rate was 3.8 in January of 1910 but

forthcoming; Alsan and Goldin forthcoming). Cause of death was obtained from the death certificate and coded
using the International Classification of Diseases. When more than one medical condition was listed on the death
certificate, cause of death was based on a standardized algorithm (Armstrong et al. 1999).
11

Appendix Figure 1 shows annual diarrheal deaths as a percentage of total deaths among children under the age of
two. Appendix Figure 2 shows summer diarrheal deaths as a percentage of total diarrheal deaths.
12

In 1930, 42.2 percent of diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two occurred in the months of JuneSeptember, accounting for only 5 percent of total mortality among children in this age group.
City populations for 1910, 1920, and 1930 are from Mortality Statistics. Population was linearly interpolated for

reached as high as 29.1 in July of that same year, a peak-to-trough ratio of 7.7. The peak-totrough ratio had fallen to 3.5 by 1920, and it had fallen to 2.6 by 1930. 14

3.1. Geography, Temperature, and Summer Diarrhea
Rush (1794, p. 159) wrote that summer diarrhea went by the name of “the April and May
disease” in Charlestown “from making its first appearance in those two months…” He went on
to observe that it “seldom appears in Philadelphia till the middle of June, or the beginning of
July…” (p. 159). Other physicians agreed with Rush, asserting that the phenomenon began
earlier, and lasted longer, in the South (King 1837; Copeland 1855; Condie 1858; Smith 1905).
The top panel of Figure 4 shows diarrheal deaths per 100,000 population by month for
the first half of the period under study (i.e., 1910-1920) in northern versus southern cities using
the 40th parallel north as the cutoff. 15 Consistent with an observation first made by Copeland
(1855), the diarrheal mortality rate was lower in southern, as compared to northern, cities. 16
Figure 4, however, provides little evidence that the phenomenon of summer diarrhea began
earlier, or lasted longer, in cities located below the 40th parallel north, although mortality tended
to peak in July as opposed to August.

14

In September of 1930, diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two peaked at 2.0 per 100,000 population
in the 26 cities that compose our sample; in December of 1930, there were only 0.8 diarrheal deaths per 100,000
population.
15

The cities in our sample below the 40th parallel north are Baltimore, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los
Angeles, Louisville, New Orleans, Philadelphia, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Washington DC.
16

Copeland (1855, p. 385) observed: “In our Southern cities it is even less rife than in, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
New York, which proves that it is not dependent on heat alone, which some have supposed.” His observation was
repeated by Rogers (1869) and Maxwell (1887). For instance, Maxwell (1887, p. 538), who practiced medicine in
Ocala, Florida, wrote that the town had:
…about 2500 inhabitants and…it is entirely exempt from cholera infantum. During the last six
summers I have resided and practiced medicine there, and have not seen or heard of a case of that
disease.

8

The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows diarrheal deaths per 100,000 population by month in
northern versus southern cities for the second half of the period under study (i.e., 1921-1930).
During this later period, the monthly diarrheal mortality rate was, on average, slightly lower in
northern cities, but again there is no evidence that the phenomenon of summer diarrhea began
earlier or lasted longer in southern cities. However, it should be noted that only one of the cities
in our sample (New Orleans, Louisiana) was located in the Deep South. In Figure 5, we show
the monthly diarrheal mortality rate for New Orleans. During the period 1910-1920, the
diarrheal mortality rate for children under the age of two in New Orleans began to climb in April
and peaked in May; it peaked in June during the period 1921-1930.
We explore the relationship between temperature and diarrheal mortality in Figure 6. As
discussed above, bacteria such as E. coli and Shigella grow rapidly in the heat of summer
(Winﬁeld and Groisman 2003; Noor 2013; Girma 2015), while viral infections that cause
diarrhea typically peak in winter months (Pawlowski et al. 2009). It is not clear, however,
whether such seasonality is due to temperature, humidity, changes in behavior, or host
susceptibility (Ahmed et al. 2013). 17
Figure 6 shows diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two per 100,000
population for the following city-month combinations: those with an average temperature less
than 60° F, those with an average temperature between 60-70° F, and those with an average
temperature equal to or greater than 70° F. Several patterns are evident in Figure 6. 18 First,

17

According to a recent review, noroviruses “are the most common cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of
gastroenteritis across all age groups worldwide” (Ahmed et al. 2013, p. 1). Rotavirus infections are another
important cause of gastroenteritis among children under the age of 5 (Patel et al. 2013). Hospitalizations and
outpatient visits for rotavirus and norovirus infections typically peak in the winter months (D’Souza, Hall and
Becker 2008; Gastañaduy et al. 2013; Patel et al. 2013). Parasitic infections, which can also cause diarrhea, are
more common in the summer months (Amin 2002).
18

Data on temperature come from the nClimDiv data set at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is available at:

9

throughout the period under study, the diarrheal mortality rate was highest when the average
temperature was at or above 70° F and lowest when the average temperature was below 60° F. 19
Second, diarrheal mortality rates exhibited steady declines across all three of the temperature
bands. Lastly, these declines were most pronounced at higher temperatures. For example,
diarrheal deaths at or above 70° F fell by 91 percent, from 21.5 per 100,000 population in 1910
to 2.0 in 1930. By contrast, the diarrheal mortality rate at average temperatures less than 60° F
fell by 77 percent, from 4.4 in 1910 to 1.0 in 1930.
In the next section, we explore whether the waning of summer diarrhea, documented in
Figures 1-6, was related to public health interventions undertaken at the municipal level. A
description of these interventions can be found in Anderson et al. (2018), who were interested in
whether public health interventions could explain the declines in total and infant mortality over
the first decades of the 20th century. 20 Anderson et al. (2018) found that filtration was associated
with a (statistically insignificant) 15 percent reduction in diarrheal deaths among children under
the age of two, an estimate that falls well short of explaining the dramatic reduction in diarrheal

ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/. Monthly temperature variables are measured at the climate division
level (there are 344 climate divisions covering the entire continental United States). We mapped each city in our
sample to its corresponding climate division using ArcGIS. Please see the following document for more details on
the construction of the nClimDiv data set: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/divisional-readme.txt.
19

This pattern is consistent with studies showing a strong, positive relationship between temperature and infant
mortality in developing countries (Banerjee and Bhowmick 2016; Geruso and Spears 2018). See Barreca et al.
(2016) for evidence that the positive relationship between temperature and mortality weakened during the 20th
century. Barreca et al. (2016, p. 156) concluded that air conditioning was:
…a central determinant in the reduction of the mortality risk associated with high temperatures
during the twentieth century. Specifically, the diffusion of residential air conditioning after 1960
is related to a statistically significant and economically meaningful reduction in the temperaturemortality relationship at high temperatures.
20
Using data on 25 major American cities for the period 1900-1940, Anderson et al. (2018) explored the effects of
filtration and chlorination on infant and total mortality. In addition, they explored the effects of sewage treatment,
projects designed to deliver clean water from further afield such as aqueducts and cribs, and municipal efforts to
clean up milk supplies. Contrary to the consensus view, Anderson et al. (2018) found that none of the interventions
under study contributed substantially to the observed declines in mortality.

mortality during the early 1900s. Because these authors used annual mortality data, they could
not examine the determinants of seasonality.

4. PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS AND THE WANING OF SUMMER DIARRHEA
Economists and historians have long asserted that public health efforts undertaken at the
municipal level caused the waning of summer diarrhea (Cheney 1984; Condran 1988; Meckel
1990; Fishback et al. 2011). For instance, Cheney (1984) and Condran (1988) argued that efforts
to purify milk supplies caused its waning, while Meckel (1990) and Fishback et al. (2011)
pointed to the combined effects of purifying milk and water supplies. 21
The remainder of this study is devoted to exploring the relationship between public health
interventions at the municipal level and the phenomenon of summer diarrhea. We begin our
exploration of this relationship by estimating the following regression:

(1)

ln(Diarrheact) = β0 + β1Filtrationct + β2Filtrationct × Summert + β3Chlorinationct
+ β4 Chlorinationct × Summert + Xctβ5 + vc + wt + Θc· t + εct,

Fishback et al. (2011, p. 140) noted that as “pasteurized milk became more common and cities ﬁltered public
water supplies, the rates of typhoid and diarrhea no longer varied much by season or in response to temperature.”
Meckel (1990, p. 89) was considerably more cautious. He wrote:
21

It is extremely difficult to assess with any certainty the effect that milk regulation and especially
commercial pasteurization had on the urban infant death rate. Infant mortality is causally
complex, and its reduction is usually tied to an amalgam of changes in the social and material
environment. The implementation of milk regulations and the introduction of pasteurization came
at a time when many municipalities were also making significant strides in improving their water
supply, sewerage, and refuse removal systems…Nevertheless, infant mortality, and especially
mortality from diarrheal diseases did decline concurrent with the implementation of effective milk
regulations and the adoption of commercial pasteurization in America’s larger cities. As one
demographer has recently demonstrated, summer mortality among infants, which declined slowly
between 1890 and 1910, dropped rapidly in the second decade of the century and by 1921 was all
but negligible.

11

where Diarrhea is equal to diarrheal deaths per 100,000 population among children under the age
of two in city c and month t, where t = 1…252. 22 Filtration is an indicator for whether a water
filtration plant was in operation and Chlorination is an indicator for whether the water supply
was chemically treated. 23 These indicators are interacted with Summer, which is equal to 1 for
the months of June-September and equal to zero for the non-summer months.
Demographic controls, based on information from the 1910, 1920, and 1930 Censuses
(and linearly interpolated for intercensal months), are represented by the vector Xct and are listed
in Table 1, along with descriptive statistics and definitions. City-level characteristics include the
natural log of population and percentages of the population by gender, race, foreign-born status,
and age group. City and month-by-year fixed effects are represented by the terms vc and wt,
respectively. The city fixed effects control for determinants of diarrheal mortality that were
constant over time, and the month-by-year fixed effects control for common shocks. Cityspecific linear time trends, represented by the term Θc· t, account for the possibility that diarrheal
mortality evolved at different rates in the 26 cities that compose our sample. All regressions are
weighted by city populations and standard errors are corrected for clustering at the city level
(Bertrand et al. 2004).
Our primary interest is in the parameters β1 through β4. β1 represents the effect of
filtration on diarrheal mortality in the non-summer months, while β1 + β2 represents the effect of
filtration in the months of June-September; likewise, β3 represents the effect of chlorination on

22

Our data cover the period 1910-1930 (12 x 21 = 252).

23
Water filtration technology was originally developed to reduce discoloration and turbidity, but gained support as
the study of bacteriology advanced and city governments came under increasing pressure to protect their citizens
from infectious diseases (McCarthy 1987; Melosi 2008). Unlike water filtration, the chlorination process was
simple and inexpensive: water was added to calcium hypochlorite, which was then mixed with the water supply
before delivery (Hooker 1913). See Melosi (2008) and Anderson et al. (2018) for more information on the history

diarrheal mortality in the non-summer months, while β3 + β4 represents the effect of chlorination
in the months of June-September. During the period 1910-1930, 8 cities adopted filtration
technology, and 24 cities began treating their water with chlorine (Appendix Table 1).
Estimates of β1 through β4 are reported in the first column of Table 2. Filtration is
associated with a 16 percent reduction in the diarrheal mortality rate during the non-summer
months (e-.176- 1 = .161), which is consistent with the hypothesis that transmission in the nonsummer months occurred through contaminated water. By contrast, we find little evidence that
filtration was effective in the months of June-September: the estimate of β2 is positive and almost
entirely offsets the estimate of β1. 24 Neither the estimate of β3 nor the estimate of β4 is
statistically distinguishable from zero.
In the second column of Table 2, we introduce two additional municipal-level public
health interventions and their interactions with the summer indicator. The first, Clean Water
Project, is equal to 1 if a new aqueduct or underground tunnel was built to deliver clean water
(and is equal to zero otherwise). 25 The second, Sewage Treated, is an indicator for whether the
city treated its sewage before discharging it into local waterways. 26 With their inclusion as
controls, water filtration is associated with a 17 percent reduction in the diarrheal mortality rate

24

The sum of these two estimates, -.016, is not statistically significant at conventional levels.

25

Identification comes from water projects undertaken by 4 cities during the period under study (Buffalo, Los
Angeles, Providence, and Newark). See Appendix Table 2 for more information.

26

Identification comes from sewage treatment plants built by 8 cities during the period under study (Baltimore,
Chicago, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Jersey City, Milwaukee, Newark, and Rochester). Following Anderson et al.
(2018), we code our sewage treatment indicator as equal to zero for cities that were treating less than 25 percent of
their effluent (Mohlman 1940). See Appendix Table 3 for more information. With the exception of Anderson et al.
(2018), previous studies have focused on estimating the effects of providing sewerage (i.e., the building and
extending of sewer systems) as distinct from treating sewage (i.e., using chemical or biological processes to remove
contaminants from waste water) before its discharge. See, for instance, Kesztenbaum and Rosenthal (2017) and
Alsan and Goldin (forthcoming).

during the non-summer months. However, the estimated coefficients of Clean Water Project,
Sewage Treated, and their interactions are not statistically significant at conventional levels.
In the third and final column of Table 2, we introduce an indicator for whether city c
required milk sold within its limits to meet a strict bacteriological standard. This indicator also
appears on the right-hand side of the estimating equation interacted with Summer. During the
period 1910-1930, 15 cities passed ordinances requiring that milk sold within their limits meet a
bacteriological standard (see Appendix Table 4). Because such ordinances were difficult to meet
without resorting to pasteurization (Meckel 1990, pp. 88-89), they are often referred to as
“pasteurization ordinances” (Harding 1917, p. 57; Swinford 2016, p. 254; Komisarow 2017, p.
131). For instance, New York passed an ordinance, effective on January 1, 1912, requiring that
“certified” raw milk have less than 30,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter, and that “inspected”
raw milk have less than 60,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter. 27
Anderson et al. (2018) found little evidence that setting a bacteriological standard for
milk reduced infant mortality. Our results are consistent with theirs. Specifically, the estimated
coefficient of the bacteriological standard indicator is actually positive and statistically
significant at the .10 level. By contrast, the estimated coefficient of the interaction between

27

Pasteurized “selected milk” was required to have less than 50,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter (New York 1912;
New York Department of Health 1913). Other cities explicitly exempted pasteurized milk from having to meet the
bacteriological standard or allowed higher levels of bacteria in raw milk that was to be pasteurized before being
sold. During the period 1910-1930, only two cities in our sample (Detroit and Chicago) required that all milk sold
within their limits be pasteurized. Detroit passed its pasteurization ordinance in 1915 without first requiring that
milk meet a bacteriological standard and that it come from tuberculin-tested cows (Kiefer 1911; Clement and
Warber 1918). One year later, the Chicago commissioner of health, worried about an outbreak of Polio, ordered that
all milk sold in the city be pasteurized (Czaplicki 2007).

Bacteriological Standard and the summer indicator is negative and larger in absolute magnitude,
but it is not sufficiently precise to reject the null. 28

4.1. Robustness Checks
Rapid industrialization during the period under study led to substantial increases in
purchasing power (Bry 1960; Rees and Jacobs 1961). In the first column of Table 3, we explore
whether the filtration estimates described above are robust to controlling for the real
manufacturing wage, which can be thought of as measuring the purchasing power of urban
workers. 29 The estimated coefficient of the filtration indicator retains its magnitude and
significance (specifically, water filtration is associated with a 14 percent reduction in diarrheal
mortality during the non-summer months), suggesting that the negative relationship between
filtration and diarrheal mortality in the non-summer months cannot be explained by changes in
the purchasing power of urban workers.
In addition to including the manufacturing wage on the right-hand side of equation (1),
we experiment with controlling for region-by-year fixed effects, not weighting by population,
dropping the most populous city (i.e., New York City) from the sample, dropping the years
1917-1920 to avoid potential confounding from the effects of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic,
and specifying the dependent variable in levels. The results of these robustness checks, which
are shown in the remaining columns of Table 3, suggest that the negative relationship between

In Appendix Table 5, we replace the Summer indicator with a variable equal to 1 if the average temperature in city
c during month t was equal to or great than 70° F. The results from this exercise are qualitatively similar to those
reported in Table 2.

28

Data on the manufacturing wage come from the Biennial Census of Manufactures. The manufacturing wage is
linearly imputed for missing years and deflated using price indices in Rees and Jacobs (1961) and the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (1973).

water filtration and diarrheal mortality in the non-summer months is not an artifact of
specification or sample choice.
Next, we estimate a modified version of equation (1) in which the filtration indicator is
decomposed into a series of mutually exclusive lags. The results are reported in the first two
columns of Table 4. They suggest that the effect of water filtration on diarrheal deaths occurring
during non-summer months was immediate. Specifically, filtration is associated with a 15
percent decrease in diarrheal mortality in the year of implementation (Year 0); after 5 or more
years, it is associated with a 19 percent decrease. Consistent with the results discussed above,
there is little evidence that filtration affected diarrheal deaths in the months of June-September.
In the last two columns of Table 4, we replace the filtration indicator with a series of its
leads and lags. The lagged effects are similar to those described above. In Year 0, filtration is
associated with a 15 percent decrease in non-summer diarrheal mortality; after 5 or more years,
filtration is associated with a 20 percent decrease in non-summer diarrheal mortality. Again,
there is no evidence that filtration had an impact on diarrheal deaths in the months of JuneSeptember. Consistent with the parallel-trends assumption, the coefficient estimates on the leads
of the filtration indicator are not statistically distinguishable from zero. Figures 7 and 8
reproduce the results reported in columns (3) and (4) of Table 4, respectively. 30

30

There is reason to believe that the effect of opening a water filtration plant might, at least initially, be muted. For
instance, the Cleveland filtration plant mixed its output with “raw” (i.e., unfiltered) water before delivery during its
first 6 months of operation (Unknown Author 1918). The effort to provide filtered water to every neighborhood in
Philadelphia took more than seven years (Cutler and Miller 2018). Cutler and Miller (2018) argued that the
Philadelphia water filtration indicator should “turn on” in 1909, the year in which the largest filtration facility
(Torresdale) began providing the majority of Philadelphia residents with clean drinking water. The pre-treatment
trends in Figures 7 and 8 looked similar when we experimented with turning on the Philadelphia filtration indicator
in 1909 as opposed to 1906.

5. CONCLUSION
Although progress has been made over the last few decades, diarrheal disease is still the
second-leading cause of death among children under the age of 5 (Liu et al. 2015), and it
continues to exhibit pronounced seasonality in many parts of the developing world (Zhang et al.
2010; Phung et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2015; Kulinkina et al. 2016; Muluken et al. 2017). Because
this seasonality is expected to intensify with climate change (Christensen et al. 2007; Asian
Development Bank 2009; Lyon and Camargo 2009), understanding its causes is taking on a new
urgency.
In the United States at the turn of the 20th century, tens of thousands of American
children would die from diarrhea-related disease every summer. One of the principal
contributions of this study is to simply document the scale of this phenomenon. Using newly
transcribed diarrheal mortality data at the monthly level for the 26 most populous American
cities as of 1910, we find that summer diarrhea was a major contributor to child mortality. For
instance, in 1910 there were over 21,000 diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two in
these cities, accounting for 30 percent of total mortality in this age group; two-thirds of diarrheal
deaths among these children occurred in the months of June-September.
The phenomenon of summer diarrhea had largely dissipated by 1930. In that year, only
3,513 children under the age of two died from diarrhea in the 26 cities under study, and only
1,482 of these deaths occurred in the summer months. The precise cause of summer diarrhea
was never isolated and the memory of its toll eventually receded.
Economists and historians generally believe that the dissipation of summer diarrhea was
due to public health efforts undertaken at the municipal level (Cheney 1984; Condran 1987;
Meckel 1990; Fishback et al. 2011). Evidence for this belief, however, is anecdotal or based on

17

a handful of case studies (Cheney 1984; Condran 1987; Condran and Lentzner. 2004). In
addition to documenting the phenomenon of summer diarrhea, we explore whether its waning
over the period 1910-1930 was, in fact, related to public health interventions undertaken at the
municipal level. We find that the building of a water filtration plant is associated with a 15-17
percent reduction in diarrheal mortality during non-summer months. By contrast, there is no
evidence that water filtration led to a reduction in diarrheal mortality during the months of JuneSeptember, nor is there evidence that other municipal-level public health efforts (including
sewage treatment plants and setting strict bacteriological standards for milk) resulted in the
dissipation of summer diarrhea. This pattern of results is consistent with those of Anderson et al.
(forthcoming) and Anderson et al. (2018), who concluded that public health efforts at the
municipal level were not important drivers of the urban mortality transition. Perhaps other, more
difficult-to-measure factors, such as nutrition, improvements in medical care, the adoption of
more hygienic practices, or better living conditions were responsible for the waning of summer
diarrhea.

Philadelphia, PA: Filtration began before 1906, but not all parts of the city received filtered
water until February, 1909. Pittsburgh, PA: By October 1908, the water supply of
peninsular Pittsburgh was being filtered. In 1909 and 1914, the Southside and the Northside,
respectively, began receiving filtered water.
b

Chicago, IL: Chlorination began in 1912, but full chlorination was not achieved until 1917.
Milwaukee, WI: Water was chlorinated from June, 1910-December, 1910; February, 1912March 1912; April, 1912 onwards. Newark, NJ: Chlorine was used in rare, emergency-only
cases beginning in 1913; continuous use started in 1921. Philadelphia, PA: Water was
chlorinated from December, 1910-April, 1911; December, 1911-February, 1913; November,
1913 onwards. Pittsburgh, PA: Water was chlorinated from January, 1910-March, 1910;
November, 1910-April, 1911; August, 1911 onwards.
Notes: Identification of the Filtration indicator comes from the cities that began filtering their
water supply during the period 1910-1930. Identification of the Chlorination indicator comes
from the cities that began chlorinating their water supply during the period 1910-1930.

Baltimore, MD: On October 15, 1912, Baltimore passed an ordinance setting a bacteriological
standard, but the first milk inspectors did not start working until January 1, 1913. Boston, MA:
On March 1, 1905, the Boston Board of Health (in conjunction with the State Board of Health)
set a bacteriological standard for health inspectors to follow. On January 8, 1913, Boston passed
an ordinance that required licensing of milk producers and set a bacteriological standard.
Buffalo, NY: The Buffalo Health Commissioner conducted bacteriological tests of milk as early
as 1907, but standards were not set by law until October 9, 1918. Chicago, IL: The Chicago
milk ordinance that came into effect on January 1, 1909 was nullified by the Illinois legislature
on June 12, 1911. A new ordinance, passed on August 14, 1912, required that non-pasteurized
milk come from tuberculin-tested cows and meet a bacteriological standard. On July 22, 1916,
the Chicago Commissioner of Health required that all milk be pasteurized. Detroit, MI: An
ordinance required that all milk sold in Detroit be pasteurized as of May 1, 1915. Philadelphia,
PA: As of October 15, 1909, dairy farmers were required to have a license. Although
inspections were conducted under rules set by the Board of Health, a bacteriological standard
was not enforced until July 1, 1915.
Notes: Identification of the Bacteriological Standard indicator comes from the cities that began
requiring that milk sold within their limits meet a bacteriological standard during the period
1910-1930.

*Statistically significant at 10% level; ** at 5% level; *** at 1% level.
Notes: Based on annual data from Mortality Statistics for the period 1910-1930, published by the U.S.
Census Bureau. Each column represents the results from a separate OLS regression. The dependent variable
is equal to the natural log of the number of diarrheal deaths among children under the age of two per 100,000
population in city c and month t. Controls include the city characteristics listed in Table 1, city fixed effects,
month-by-year fixed effects, and city-specific linear trends. Regressions are weighted by city population.
Standard errors, corrected for clustering at the city level, are in parentheses.
