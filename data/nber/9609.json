The results indicate that increases in the risk of war cause declines in Treasury yields and equity prices, a widening of lower-grade corporate spreads, a fall in the dollar, and a rise in oil prices. This  war risk factor' accounted for a considerable portion of the variance of these financial variables over the ten weeks leading up to the onset of war with Iraq.\n\n",
