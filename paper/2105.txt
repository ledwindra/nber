Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Determination

ABSTRACT

Since Meese and Rogoff's (1983) results, the view has become fairly
widespread that structural models of exchange rates are not very good.

There is, however, somewhat of a dichotomy in the literature between those
who deal with small models, where the focus is almost exclusively on
exchange rates, and those who deal with large macroeconometric models, where
exchange rates make up only a small subset of the endogenous variables.

Most of the emphasis has been on the first approach, and it may be that
exchange rate determination within the context of large models has not been
given a sufficient hearing.

Exchange rate and interest rate equations are estimated and analyzed

for 17 countries in this paper. This study is part of a larger project of
constructing a multicountry econometric model. One of the aims of the paper
is to see if the exchange rate equations that are part of my multicountry

model also suffer from the Meese and Rogoff criticism. The results show
that the view that structural exchange rate models are not very good may be
too pessimistic.

Introduction

It is well known that modeling exchange rates is difficult. Meese and
Rogoff's (1983) results show that a random walk model performs as well as or
better than a variety of structural models, where the forecasts from the
structural models are based on the actual values of the future explanatory

variables. Because of these and other results, the view has become fairly
widespread that structural models of exchange rates are not very good.
There is, however, somewhat of a dichotomy in the literature between those

who deal with small models, where the focus is almost exclusively on
exchange rates, and those who deal with large macroeconometric models, where

exchange rates make up only a small subset of the endogenous variables. One
might have thought, for example, that in a survey like Levich's (1985) both
types of models would be considered, but the large models are given only one

footnote (fn. 19, p. 1001). It may be that exchange rate determination
within the context of large models has not been given a sufficient hearing.
Exchange rate and interest rate equations are estimated and analyzed

for 17 countries in this paper. This study is part of a larger project of
constructing a multicountry econometric model. One of the aims of this
paper is to see if the exchange rate equations that are part of my

multicountry model also suffer from the Meese and Rogoff criticism. The
results show that the view that structural exchange rate models are not very

good may be too pessimistic.

The theory upon which the multicountry econometric model is based is

outlined in Section II. The exchange rate and interest rate equations are
estimated in Section III and tested in Section IV.

II. The Theoretical Model
The main features of my multicountry econometric model can be seen by

analyzing a two country model.2 Capital letters will denote variables for
country 1, lower case letters will denote variables for country 2, and an
asterisk (*) on a variable will denote the other country's holdings or

purchase of the variable. There are three sectors per country: private non
financial (p), financial (b), and government (g). The private non financial
sector includes both households and firms. It will be called the "private

sector." Members of the financial sector will be called "banks." Each
country specializes in the production of one good (X,x). Each country has
its own money (M,m) and its own bond (B,b). Only the private sector of the
given country holds the money of the country. The bonds are one-period
securities. If a sector is a debtor with respect to a bond (i.e., a
supplier of the bond), then the value of B or b for this sector is negative.

The interest rate on B is R and on b is r. The price of X is P and of x is
p. e is the price of country 2's currency in terms of country l's currency,
so that, for example, and increase in e is a depreciation of country l's

2The following model is similar to the model in Fair (1979), although
the present model is simpler. In the earlier model, household and firm
sectors were considered separately, a labor market was introduced, and each
country was allowed to hold the other country's money. It is unnecessary to
introduce these features into the present model for purposes of this paper.

3

currency. The government of each country holds a positive amount of the
international reserve (Q,q), which is denominated in the units of country

l's currency. The government of a country does not hold the bond of the
other country and does not buy the good of the other country. Y denotes
real GNP of country 1, and y denotes real GNP of country 2.

There are 17 equations per country and one redundant equation. The
equations for country 1 are as follows. (The sign above an explanatory
variable indicates the expected effect of the variable on the left hand side

variable.) The demands for the two goods by the private sector of country 1
are

(1) X

f1(P, e.p, R, Y)

(2) x — f2(P,

e.p, R, Y)

The demands are a function of the two prices, the interest rate, and income

as measured by CNP. X is the purchase of country l's good by the private
sector of country 1, and x* is the purchase of country 2's good by the

private sector of country 1. The domestic price level is assumed to be a
function of demand pressure as measured by Y and of the level of import
prices, e.p:

+

(3)

P =

f3(Y,

+
e.p)

There is assumed to be no inventory investment, so that production is equal
to sales:

(4)

Y=Xp +Xg +X*p

where Xg is the purchase of country l's good by its government and

is the

4

purchase of country l's good by country 2. Taxes paid to the government are

(5) T = TX.Y
where TX is the tax rate.3
The demand for money is assumed to be a function of the interest rate
and income:

(6) M/P = f6(R,

Y)

Borrowing by the banks from the monetary authority (BO) is assumed to be a
function of R and of the discount rate RD:

+

(7) BO = f7(R,

RD)

Since the private sector is assumed to be the only sector holding money,

(8) M,0=M
where Mb is the money held in banks. Equation (8) simply says that all
money is held in banks. Banks are assumed to hold no excess reserves, so
that

(9) BR =

RR.M0

where BR is the level of bank reserves and RR is the reserve requirement

3There are some differences between the above model and my multicountry
econometric model. In the econometric model, separate consumption and fixed
investment equations are estimated (consumption and investment including
both domestic and foreign goods), an equation determining inventory
investment is estimated, and in the CNP definition GNP is equal to
consumption plus fixed investment plus inventory investment plus government
spending plus exports minus imports. Imports are subtracted because they
are in consumption and investment. Again, for purposes of this paper it is
unnecessary to add these features to the theoretical model.

rate.

The expected (one-period) return on the bond of country 2 is

(e1/e)(l +

r)

1, where e1 is the expected exchange rate for the next

-

period based on information available in the current period and r is the

interest rate on the bond of country 2. The demand for country 2's bond is
assumed to be a function of R and of the expected return on country 2's
bond:

+

*

(10) o

e

f10[R, (e1/e)(J. +

r,

-1]

b* is the amount of country 2's bond held by country 1. If capital mobility
is high, large changes in b* will result from small changes in the

difference between R and the expected return on country 2's bond. If
capital mobility is perfect, R is always equal to the expected return on

country 2's bond, and equation (10) drops out. It is assumed here that
capital mobility is not perfect.
The next three equations determine the financial saving of each sector:

Equation (11) states that the saving of the private sector is equal to
revenue from the sale of goods to the government plus export revenue minus
import costs minus taxes paid plus interest received (or minus interest
paid) on the holdings of country l's bond and plus interest received on the

holdings of country 2's bond. If the private sector is a net debtor with

respect to the bond of country 1, then B is negative and R.B measures

6

interest payments. Remember that the private sector (p) is a combination of
households and firms, and so transactions between households and firms net

out of equation (11). Equation (12) states that the saving of banks is
equal to interest revenue on bond holdings (assuming Bb is positive) minus

interest payments on borrowings from the monetary authority. Equation (13)

determines the government's surplus or deficit. It states that the saving
of the government is equal to tax revenue minus expenditures on goods minus

interest costs (assuming B is negative) and plus interest received on loans
to banks.

The next three equations are the budget constraints facing each sector:

Equation (14) states that any nonzero value of saving of the private sector

must result in the change in its money or bond holdings. Equation (15)
states that any nonzero value of saving of the financial sector must result
in the change in bond holdings, money deposits (which are a liability to

banks), or nonborrowed reserves. Equation (16) states that any nonzero
value of saving of the government must result in the change in bond
holdings, nonborrowed reserves (which are a liability to the government), or
international reserve holdings.

There is also a constraint across all sectors, which says that
someone's asset is someone else's liability with respect to the bond of
country 1:

(17)

0=Bp +Bb +Bg

*
p

7

These same 17 equations are assumed to hold for country 2, with lower
case and upper case letters reversed except for Q and with l/e replacing e.
Q is replaced by q/e.

(Remember that Q and q are in the units of country

l's currency.) The last equation of the model is

(35) 0 = LQ +

q

which says that the change in reserves across countries is zero. Equation
(35) is implied by equations (11) -

(17) and the equivalent equations for

country 2, and so it is redundant. There are thus 34 independent equations
in the model.

In the present analysis the following variables for country 1 are

always taken to be exogenous: Xg government purchases of goods; TX, the
tax rate; RD, the discount rate; and RR, the reserve requirement rate. The
same is true for country 2. Not counting these variables, there are 38

variables in the model: Bb,

In

order to close the model one needs to make an assumption about how e1 is
determined and to take three other variables as exogenous.

Assume for now that exchange rate expectations are static in the sense

that e1 e always. The model can then be closed by taking

Bg bg and Q

as exogenous. These are the three main tools of the monetary authorities.
Instead of taking the three tools to be exogenous, however, one can assume
that the monetary authorities use the tools to manipulate R, r, and e.
(Remember that it is assumed here that capital mobility is not perfect,

which implies that the monetary authorities can in principle achieve any

8

target values of R, r, and e that they want.) Another way of putting this
is that one can take R, r, and e to be exogenous in the model if

Bg bg and

Q are taken to be endogenous. The solution values of Bg bg and Q will be
whatever is needed to have the exogenously chosen values of R, r, and e be
met.

The estimated exchange rate and interest rate equations in my
multicountry model are based on the assumption that the monetary authorities

manipulate R, r, and e. Exchange rate and interest rate treaction
functions" are estimated, where the explanatory variables in these equations
are assumed to be variables that affect the monetary authorities' decisions.
The key question, of course, is what variables affect the monetary

authorities' decisions. If capital mobility is high, it will take large
changes in the three tools to achieve values of R, r, and e much different

from what the market would otherwise achieve. Since the monetary
authorities are likely to want to avoid large changes in the tools, they are

likely to be sensitive to and influenced by market forces. In short, they
are likely to take market forces into account in setting their target values

of R, r, and e. Therefore, one needs to know the market forces that affect
R, r, and e in the model in order to guide the choice of explanatory
variables in the reaction functions.
In order to examine the market forces on R, r, and e in the model, a

"simulation" version has been analyzed. Particular functional forms and
coefficients have been chosen for equations (1), (2), (3), (6), (7), and

(10) and the equivalent equations for country 2. The twelve chosen
equations for the simulation version are presented in the Appendix along

with the base values of all the variables. The simulation model can be

9

solved using the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. A given set of "base" values was
chosen for the exogenous variables, and the model was solved for the

endogenous variables. These solution values of the endogenous variables are
then their base values. The model is analyzed by changing something in it
and solving it again. The difference between the new solution value for an
endogenous variable and the old solution value (i.e., the base value) is the
amount by which the change has affected the endogenous variable.
In order to help in understanding the properties of the model, it will
be useful to consider two equations that can be derived from the others.
Let S denote the financial saving of country 1, which is the sum of the
saving of the three sectors: S

S, + Sb ÷ S. S is the balance of payments

on current account of country 1. Summing equations (14)-(16) and using (17)
yields:

(36) 0

This

S +B* - e,ib*

-

equation simply says that any nonzero value of saving of country 1 must

result in the change in at least one of the following three: country 2's

holdings of country l's bond, country l's holding of country 2's bond, and

country l's holding of the international reserve. The derived equation for
S can be obtained by summing equations (1l)-(13) and using (17):

(37)

This equation says that the saving of country 1 is equal to export revenue

minus import costs minus interest paid to country 2 plus interest received
from country 2.

The following experiments give an idea of the market forces affecting

10

R, r, and e in the model.4 Unless otherwise noted, the experiments are

based on the assumption that e1 e. This means from equation (10) and the
equivalent equation for country 2 that b* and B* are simply a function of R
and r. In all but the last experiment e is endogenous and Q is exogenous.
Taking Q to be exogenous means that the monetary authorities are not

manipulating e. This is a way of examining the market forces on e. The
solution value of e for each experiment is the value that would pertain if
the monetary authorities did not intervene at all in the foreign exchange
market in response to whatever change was made for the experiment.

Bg and

bg are always endogenous for the experiments because all the experiments
either have R and r exogenous or M.D and m.D exogenous. In other words, it is

always assumed that the monetary authorities either keep interest rates or
money supplies unchanged in response to whatever change was made for the
experiment. When R and r are exogenous, Mb and m.D are endogenous, and vice

versa. All shocks in the experiments are for country 1.

Experiment 1: R exogenous and lowered, r exogenous and unchanged.
For this experiment the interest rate for country 1 was lowered (from
its base value) and the interest rate for country 2 was assumed to remain

unchanged. This change resulted in a depreciation of country l's currency.
The fall in R relative to r led to an increase in the demand for the bond of
country 2 by country 1 (b* increased) and a decrease in the demand for the

bond of country 1 by country 2 (B* decreased). From equation (36) it can be

following discussion. The numerical magnitudes mean very little; the
simulation model is simply meant to be used to help in understanding the
qualitative effects on the various variables. See the Appendix for further
discussion of this.

11

seen that this must result in an increase in S, country l's balance of

payments, since Q

is

exogenous and unchanged. S is increased by increasing

country l's exports and decreasing its imports --

equation

(37) --

which

is

accomplished by a depreciation. Another way of looking at this is that the
fall in R relative to r led to a decreased demand for country l's currency
because of the capital outflow, which resulted in a depreciation of country

l's currency. GNP for country 1 increased because of the lower interest
rate and the depreciation, and the demand for money increased because of the

lower interest rate and the higher level of income. The monetary authority
of country 1 bought bonds to achieve the reduction in R (Bg increased).

Experiments with alternative coefficients in the equations explaining

b and B* - -

equation

(10) and the equivalent equation for country 2 - -

showed that the more sensitive are the demands for the foreign bonds to the
interest rate differential, the larger is the depreciation of the exchange

rate and the larger is the increase in Bg for the same drop in R. In other
words, the higher is the degree of capital mobility, the larger is the size
of open market operations that is needed to achieve a given target value of
the interest rate.

Remember that the above experiment is for the case in which exchange

rate expectations are static, i.e. where e1 — e.

If instead expectations

are formed in such a way that e1 turns out to be less than e, which means
that the exchange rate is expected to appreciate in the next period (i.e.,

reverse at least some of the depreciation in the current period), then the

depreciation in the current period is less. This is because if e1 is less
than e, the expected return on country 2's bond falls. The differential
between R and the expected return on country 2's bond thus falls less as a

12

result

*
of the decrease in R, which leads to a smaller increase in b and a

smaller decrease in B*. There is thus less downward pressure on country l's
currency and thus a smaller depreciation. If expectations are formed in
such a way that e1 turns out to be greater than e, which means that the
exchange rate is expected to depreciate further in the next period, there is

more of a depreciation in the current period. The expected return on
country 2's bond rises, which leads to greater downward pressure on country
l's exchange rate.

Experiment 2: Mb exogenous and increased, m.D exogenous and unchanged.
For this experiment the monetary authorities are assumed to target the

money supplies Mb and nib), and the money supply of country 1 was increased.
The increase in M.D led to a decrease in R, both absolutely and relative to

r, which led to a depreciation of country l's currency. The results of this
experiment are similar to those of experiment 1. The monetary authority of

country 1 bought bonds to increase the money supply (B increased). Country
l's CNP increased as a result of the depreciation and the fall in R. Note
that the effect of a change in the money supply on the exchange rate works

through the change in relative interest rates. The interest rate of country
1 falls relative to that of country 2, which decreases the demand for
country l's bond and increases the demand for country 2's bond, which leads
to a depreciation of country l's exchange rate.

Experiment 3: Positive price shock, R and r exogenous and unchanged.
For this experiment the price equation for country 1 was shocked

positively. The monetary authorities were assumed to respond to this by

13

keeping interest rates unchanged. The positive price shock resulted in a
depreciation of country l's currency. A positive price shock leads to a
decrease in the demand for exports and an increase in the demand for
imports, which puts downward pressure on S.

If, however, interest rates are

unchanged, b* and B* do not change, which means from equation (36) that S

cannot change. Therefore, a depreciation must take place to decrease export
demand and increase import demand enough to offset the effects of the price

shock. Put another way, a positive price shock leads to a decreased demand
for country l's currency because of the increased import demand and the
decreased export demand, which puts downward pressure on the price of the
currency.

Experiment 4: Positive price shock, M.D and m.b exogenous and unchanged.

This experiment is the same as experiment 3 except that the money

supplies are kept unchanged rather than the interest rates. The positive
price shock with the money supplies unchanged led to an increase in R, both
absolutely and relative to r. Even though R increased relative to r,

country l's currency depreciated. The negative effects of the price shock
(though decreased export demand and increased import demand) offset the
positive effects of the interest rate changes.

Experiment 5: Positive import demand shock, Mb and nib exogenous and
unchanged.
For this experiment the import demand equation of country 1 was shocked

positively. The increased demand for imports led to a depreciation of
country l's currency, since there was an increased demand for country 2's

currency. The depreciation led to an increase in Y and P, which with an

14

unchanged money supply, led to an increase in R. R also increased relative
to r, which increased

and decreased b*. The balance of payments, S,

worsened. It may at first glance seem odd that a positive import shock
would lead to an increase in Y, but remember that the shock does not

correspond to any shock to the demand for the domestic good. The experiment
is

a substitution away from the domestic good to the imported good, but

merely an increase in demand for the imported good. The latter results in
an increase in Y because of the stimulus from the depreciation.

Experiment 6: R exogenous and lowered, r exogenous and unchanged,
e exogenous and unchanged.

This experiment is the same as experiment 1 except that e rather than Q

is exogenous. In this case the monetary authorities choose Bg bg and Q so
as to lower R and keep r and e unchanged. One of the key differences
between the results for this experiment and the results for experiment 1 is

that the balance of payments, S, decreases rather than increases. In
experiment 1 S had to increase because of the increase in the demand for
country 2's bond by country 1 and the decrease in the demand for country l's
bond by country 2.

In this case S must increase because Q is exogenous --

equation (36). The increase in S is accomplished by a depreciation. In the
present experiment there is still an increase in the demand for country 2's
bond and a decrease in the demand for country l's bond - relative to r --

but

because R falls

S does not necessarily have to increase because Q can

change. The net effect is that S decreases (and thus Q decreases). The
reason for the decrease is fairly simple. The decrease in R is an
expansionary action in country 1, and among other things it increases the

15

country's demand for imports. This then worsens the balance of payments.
There is no offsetting effect from a depreciation of the currency to reverse
this movement.

These six experiments should give one a fairly good idea of the

properties of the model. Of main concern here are the effects of the
various changes on the domestic interest rate and the exchange rate. The
following is a summary of these effects in the model (experiment 6 is not
included because both R and e are exogenous in it):

III. The Estimated Equations
The above theoretical model can be used to guide the choice of
explanatory variables for the interest rate and exchange rate reaction

functions. Before doing this, however, it will help put the present

16

approach in perspective to consider an alternative approach that could in

principle be used to estimate the model. If all the equations in the
theoretical model that are not identities were estimated, one could solve

the model for R, r, and e by taking Bg bg and Q as exogenous. R, r, and e
would thus be determined without having to estimate any direct equations for

them. In doing this, however, one would be making the rather extreme

assumption that the monetary authorities' choices of Bg bg and Q are never
influenced by the state of the economy, i.e. are always exogenous.
If one believes that monetary authorities intervene at least somewhat,

there are essentially two options open. One is to estimate equations with

Bg bg and Q on the left hand side, and the other is to estimate equations
with R, r, and e on the left hand side. If the first option is followed,

the Bg bg and Q equations are added to the model and the model is solved
for R, r, and e. If the second option is followed, the R, r, and e

equations are added to the model and the model is solved for Bg bg and Q.
The first option is awkward because one does not typically think of the

monetary authorities having target values of the instruments themselves. It
is more natural to think of them having target values of interest rates (or
money supplies5) and exchange rates, and this is the assumption made here.

There is also a practical reason for taking the present approach. If

Bg bg and Q are taken to be exogenous or equations estimated for them, the
entire model must be estimated in order to solve for R, r, and e. In

5it is in the spirit of the present approach to estimate money supply
reaction functions rather than interest rate reaction functions. In either
case B is endogenous. No attempt was made in this study to try to estimate
money upply reaction functions. This study is based on the implicit
assumption that interest rate reaction functions provide a better
approximation of the way monetary authorities behave than do money supply
reaction functions.

17

practice it is very difficult to estimate equations like (10), which

determine the bilateral demands for securities. One of the main problems is
that data on bilateral holdings of securities either do not exist or are not

very good. If equations for interest rates and exchange rates are estimated
instead, one can avoid estimating equations like (10) in order to determine
interest rates and exchange rates if one is willing to give up determining

Bg bg and Q. This is what I have done in my multicountry model. For many
applications one can get by without knowing the amounts of government bonds

outstanding and government reserve holdings. One can simply keep in mind
that the values of these variables are whatever is needed to have the

interest rate and exchange rate values be met. The estimated equations will
now be discussed.

Interest Rate Equations
Estimated interest rate equations are presented in Table 1 for 17

countries. The same set of explanatory variables was tried for each
country. The general form of the interest rate equation is

variables will now be explained.

].

The rate of inflation is assumed to have a positive effect on

the interest rate target. Monetary authorities are assumed to tighten up as
inflation rises. This is consistent with market-force effects in the
theoretical model, where a positive price shock with the money supply

unchanged led to an increase in the interest rate. The rate of inflation is
lagged once rather than unlagged in the equations in Table 1 because this
gave on average somewhat better results.

2. D: D is a measure of demand pressure in the overall multicountry
model. It is an explanatory variable in the price equation for each country
in the model. It is included in the interest rate equation to pick up
possible inflation effects not captured in the inflation variable itself.
It may be a better signal for the monetary authorities regarding future

inflation than is the inflation variable itself, and it may thus be used by
the authorities in setting interest rates.

3. A1 and A2: A is the normalized real net asset position of the
country relative to the rest of the world. The change in A is the real
value of the balance of payments except for the normalization by full

employment CNP.6 If the balance of payments of the country is weak, the

6The nominal net asset position of each country relative to the rest of
the world is obtained by summing past values of the balance of payments.
The real value of net assets is equal to the nominal value divided by the
domestic price index. A is then the real value of net assets divided by the
full employment measure of real GNP. The creation of the full employment
measure of real GNP is explained in Fair (1984), p. 162.
Let A' denote the net asset position of the country before being
divided by anything. (A' is thus in nominal terms.) In terms of the

variables in the theoretical model, A' is equal to -

+ e.LTh* +

S - tA'.
so that equation (36) becomes 0
This equation determines A' in
my multicountry model for each country, where A' is then determined as
A'1 + LA'. S is determined by an equation like (37). Because bilateral

monetary authorities may tighten up, and if the balance of payments is

strong, the authorities may feel they have room to loosen up. Experiment 6
shows that in the theoretical model with the exchange rate unchanged a

decrease in the interest rate expands the economy and worsens the balance of

payments.7 (The theoretical model is roughly symmetric, so that an increase
in the interest rate contracts the economy and improves the balance of

payments.) The authorities may be thus more likely to lower the interest
rate when the balance of payments is strong (and suffer the consequences of

some fall in the balance of payments) than when it is weak. The

coefficients on A1 and A2 were not constrained to be equal in absolute
value and of opposite signs. There may be both level and rate of change
effects, and in general it is of interest to see if the data support a

negative coefficient for A1 and a positive coefficient for A2. In some
cases the use of A0 and A1 gave better results than did the use of A1 and
A2, and in these cases the results presented in Table 1 are for A0 and A1.
4.

A rapid growth of the money supply may lead the monetary

authority to raise interest rates in the future in an attempt to lessen the

growth. The past growth rate of the money supply may thus have a positive

security demand equations are not estimated, it is not possible to determine

B*, b*, and Q

separately

in the model.

7The use of experiment 6 to justify using A1 and A2 in the interest

rate equation is not quite right. In experiment 6 the exchange rate was
taken to be unchanged. In the estimated exchange rate equation below, on
the other hand, the interest rate has an effect on the exchange rate.
Therefore, according to the estimated equations, the monetary authorities
know that if they change the interest rate this will affect the exchange
rate, which is contrary to the assumption of experiment 6. What needs to be
assumed here is that the exchange rate movement from a change in R is not so
large as to reverse the results of experiment 6 regarding the effects on S.

effect on the current value of the interest rate. If monetary authorities
are interested in both money supply growth and interest rate values, one way
of trying to capture this is to add the lagged growth of the money supply to

the interest rate equation. Note that this effect is not the effect
observed in experiment 2 for the theoretical model, where an increase in the

money supply led to a decrease in R. Although this contemporaneous effect
is negative, the lagged effect of the money supply on the interest rate may
be positive.
5.

The monetary policies of other countries may be influenced by

U.S. monetary policy, and the inclusion of the U.S. interest rate in the
equations is an attempt to test for this.

6. RGE: The German interest rate is included in the interest rate
equations for the European countries. It may be that the monetary policies
of other European countries are influenced by German monetary policy.

7. R1: Monetary authorities are likely to dislike large short run
changes in interest rates and thus try to avoid them. One way of trying to
capture this effect is by the use of the lagged dependent variable, and this

is what is done here. Monetary authorities are assumed to adjust only
partially to their desired interest rate targets in any one quarter. The
lagged dependent variable may also be picking up expectational effects.8
Each equation in Table 1 was estimated by two stage least squares

8Lagged dependent variables are freely used in my multicountry
econometric model with the aim of accounting for partial adjustment and/or
expectational effects. This "traditional" procedure was tested in Fair
(1986) using my U.S. model against a procedure that allows expectations to
be formed in more sophisticated ways, including formed rationally. The
results provide no strong support for the more sophisticated hypothesis.
Both the traditional procedure and the more sophisticated one lead to very
similar results, including results about policy properties. This is thus
some justification for the use of the present approach.

21

(2SLS) under the assumption of first order serial correlation of the error

term. The first stage regressors for each country are the main
predetermined variables in my multicountry model for that country.9 The
sample periods begin near the start of flexible exchange rates and end at
the latest available data at the time this study was undertaken.

Only a little "searching" was done for the results in Table 1. As
noted above, the inflation variable lagged once seemed to give better
results than the variable unlagged, and so the variable lagged once was used

for all the equations. In most cases the asset variable lagged once and
twice gave better results than did the variable unlagged and lagged once.
As noted above, in cases where the variable unlagged and lagged once gave

better results, these results are presented in the table. These cases are
the equations for Canada, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, and the U.K.

One should be aware in interpreting the results that collinearity can

be a serious problem in trying to get precise estimates. The sample periods
are fairly short; the inflation variable and the demand pressure variable
are likely to be highly correlated; and the two values of the asset variable

are likely to be highly correlated. One should thus not necessarily expect
very precise coefficient estimates. In what follows a variable will be said
to be "significant" if the t-statistic of its coefficient estimate is
greater than two in absolute value.
If the estimate of the serial correlation coefficient was not
significantly different from zero for a country, the equation was
reestimated with the serial correlation coefficient constrained to be zero.

9The list of first stage regressors for each equation estimated in this
paper is available from the author upon request.

22

Serial correlation is in fact not a problem for the interest rate equations.
For only three countries - - Canada, Denmark, and Portugal - - was the
estimate significant.

Consider now the coefficient estimates for the explanatory variables

in Table 1. The results are quite good for the asset variable. One expects
a negative coefficient on A1 (or A0) and a positive coefficient on A2 (or

A1). The signs are as expected except for Portugal. In other words, 32 of
the 34 estimates are of the right sign. The results are also good for the
demand pressure variable, where only 3 of the 17 coefficient estimates are

of the wrong sign. The results are not good for the inflation variable
itself, where 8 of the 17 estimates are of the wrong sign. It appears that
it is primarily the demand pressure variable that is picking up the effects

of expected future inflation on interest rate targets. The results are
likewise not good for lagged money supply growth, where 9 of the 17

estimates are of the wrong sign. The U.S. interest rate has coefficient
estimates of the right sign in all but two cases -- Japan and Portugal. The

German interest rate has coefficient estimates of the right sign in 8 of the

13 European equations. All the coefficient estimates of the lagged
dependent variable are positive and large.
The equations in Table 1 were reestimated with the variables with the

wrong signs dropped, and these results are presented in Table 2. In a few
cases dropping one variable with the wrong sign led to another variable
developing the wrong sign, and in these cases variables continued to be

dropped until there were no wrong signs among the remaining variables. The
equations in Table 2 are used for the tests in the next section.
Aside from the lagged dependent variable and the U.S. interest rate,

the asset variable is the most significant variable in Table 2.

Seven of

the coefficient estimates are significant for A1 (or A0), and six are

significant for A2 (or A1). Six of the estimates for the demand pressure
variable are significant; only two of the estimates for the inflation

variable are significant. Only one of the estimates of the lagged money
growth variable is significant.

Exchange Rate EQuations
Estimated exchange rate equations are presented in Table 3 for 17

countries. As was the case for the interest rate equations, the same set of
explanatory variables was tried for each country. The general form of the
exchange rate equation is

++

+

(39)

e =

f(P/P5,

(l+R)/(l-I-Rus), eGE, e1)

where e is the country's exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar, ppTJS is
the country's aggregate price level relative to the price level of the

United States, (l+R)/(l+Ls) is one plus the country's interest rate
relative to the same variable for the United States, and eGE is the German

exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. The choice of the explanatory
variables will now be discussed. Remember that an increase in e is a
depreciation of the country's currency relative to the U.S. dollar. Also
note in Table 3 that the functional form chosen for the exchange rate
equation is the log form.
1.

In the theoretical model a positive price shock led to a

depreciation, and so one expects a positive coefficient for the country's

relative price level. In other words, a relative price increase in a

country is likely to put downward pressure on the country's currency

relative to the U.S. dollar, and the monetary authorities may go along with

this. In a few cases the relative price variable lagged once gave better
results than did the variable unlagged, and in these cases the results
presented in Table 3 are for the lagged variable.

2. (l+R)/(l+R05):'° In the theoretical model a decrease in the
domestic interest rate led to a depreciation, and so one expects a negative

coefficient for the relative interest rate variable. In about half the
cases the relative interest rate variable lagged once gave better results
than did the variable unlagged, and in these cases the lagged variable was
used for the results in Table 3.

3. eGE: The monetary authorities of other European countries may be
influenced by the German exchange rate in deciding on their own exchange

rate targets. The use of the German rate is also an attempt to capture some
of the effects of the European Monetary System (EMS). Under the assumption
that Germany is the dominate country in the EMS, the German rate will pick

up some of the effects of the EMS agreement. As will be seen, the German
rate is a highly significant variable with a large coefficient estimate in

all the European equations. The European equations can be looked upon in
large part as explaining deviations of the particular country's rate from
the German rate.

4. The lagged dependent variable. This variable is included for the

10The interest rates in the data are at annual rates, and so one plus
the interest rate has been raised to the one-fourth power in the empirical
work to put the variables at quarterly rates. This is so indicated in
Tables 3-5. It shuld also be noted that the interest rates in Tables 1 and
2 are in percentage points (1 percent =1.0), whereas in Tables 3-5 they are
in percents (1 percent = .01).

same reasons that the lagged dependent variable was included in the interest
rate equation, namely to pick up partial adjustment and expectational
effects.

As with the interest rate equations, the exchange rate equations have
been estimated by 2SLS under the assumption of first order serial

correlation of the error term. The first stage regressors for each country
are the main predetermined variables in the multicountry model for that

country. The sample periods are the same as were used for the interest rate
equation. No searching was done for the exchange rate equations except to
try both the current and lagged values of the relative price and relative
interest rate variables.

The results in Table 3 seem reasonably good for the price and interest

rate variables. Only 4 of the 17 coefficient estimates for the relative
price variable have the wrong sign, and only 3 of the 17 estimates for the

relative interest rate variable have the wrong sign. On the negative side,
all the equations except the equation for Australia have significant

estimates of the serial correlation coefficient. The German exchange rate
is highly significant in the European equations. The coefficient estimates
of the lagged dependent variables are all positive, although some estimates
are quite small.

The equations in Table 3 were reestimated with the variables with the

wrong signs dropped, and these results are presented in Table 4. The
equations in Table 4 are used for the tests in the next section. The
results in Table 4 show that 7 of the coefficient estimates for the relative

price variable are significantly different from zero. The interest rate
coefficients are not estimated very precisely. Only two of the estimates

The Monetary Approach to Exchange Rate Determination
It is of interest to compare the present exchange rate equation with
the equation derived from what is usually called the monetary approach to

exchange rate determination. In the basic equation of the monetary approach
the exchange rate is a function of the relative money supplies of the two
countries, the relative income levels, and the relative interest rates.11
The money supply variable should have a coefficient of one, the income

variable a negative coefficient, and the interest rate variable a positive

coefficient. The equation estimated in Table 3 already has a relative
interest rate variable, and so if one adds a relative money supply variable
and a relative income variable to the equation, one has the monetary

approach equation. If the monetary approach is correct, the relative price
variable does not belong in the equation (and so should be insignificant)
and the relative interest rate variable should change signs from negative to
positive when the money supply and income variables are added.
The results of adding the relative money supply and income variables to

the Table 3 equations are presented in Table 5. The equations have been
estimated by 2SLS with account taken of first order serial correlation of
the error term, where both the money and income variables are taken to be

endogenous (as well as the price and interest rate variables). It seems
clear that the results are not supportive of the monetary approach. Eleven
of the 17 coefficient estimates of the money supply variable are negative

rather than positive,12 and 9 of the 17 estimates of the income variable are

positive rather than negative. Only 3 of the 17 estimates of the interest
rate variable are positive.
It is interesting to note that the basic equation tested by Meese and

Rogoff is the equation implied by the monetary approach. Since the data do
not seem to support this equation, it is not surprising that the equation
did not do well in their tests.

Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Effects on One Another
The interest rate and exchange rate equations have the characteristic
that the exchange rate equation has the interest rate in it, but not vice

versa. Implicit in this treatment is the assumption that the monetary
authorities make decisions sequentially. It is assumed that they first
decide on their interest rate target as a function of a number of variables

(not including the exchange rate). They then decide on their exchange rate
target, given the interest rate value and their knowledge of the market
forces on the exchange rate that this value implies.
It may be, of course, that the exchange rate affects the interest rate

as well as vice versa. If this is true, it can be incorporated in the

the lagged dependent variable in the equation, one does not
necessarily expect the coefficient of the money variable to be one. It
should only be one in the long run, which means that the coefficient
estimate for the money variable when divided by one minus the coefficient
estimate for the lagged dependent variable should be one. The coefficient
estimate for the money variable should, of course, not be negative. One
might argue that the lagged dependent variable does not belong in the
equation, depending on the dynamics that one is assuming, but this simply
means in the present context that the coefficient estimates of the lagged
dependent variable in Table 5 should be insignificant. Note that the lagged
dependent variable estimates are not picking up first order serial
correlation of the error term, because serial correlation has been taken
into account in the estimation.

28

present approach by simply adding the exchange rate as an explanatory

variable in the interest rate equation. To test for this, log e was added
to the equations in Table 2. Fourteen of the 17 coefficient estimates were
positive. Three of the estimates were significant (all positive) -- those

for Norway, Finland, and Portugal. Ten of the 17 estimates had t-statistics
less than one in absolute value. The effects on the other coefficient
estimates from the addition of log e were minor. Very similar results were

obtained when log e1 was added rather than log e. These results are thus
not very strong support for the hypothesis that the exchange rate affects
the interest rate target, although the fact that 14 of the 17 estimates were

of the same sign is perhaps mild support. Given the weak results, it was
decided not to include the exchange rate in the interest rate equations for
the tests in the next section.

Conclusion

What is one to make of the results in Tables 2 and 4? Given the short
sample periods, the results do not seem too bad. Inflationary effects
(primarily through the demand pressure variable) and net asset effects on

short term interest rates appear to be picked up in Table 2. Similarly,
relative price effects and relative interest rate effects on exchange rates

appear to be picked up in Table 4. An interesting question is how these
equations stand up against the Meese and Rogoff type of tests, and this will
now be explored.

IV. The Tests
The interest rate and exchange rate equations are tested against two

29

alternatives in this section. One is the assumption that the two variables
follow random walks, and the other is the assumption that they follow a
sixth order autoregressive equation with a constant and time trend included.
There are thus three equations per variable, which will be labeled

structural, RW, and AR6. In order to avoid giving the structural model a
possibly unfair advantage over the AR6 model, the U.S. and German interest
rates have been included in the AR6 equations for the interest rate (the

German rate included only for the European countries). Similarly, the
German exchange rate has been included in the AR6 equations for the exchange
rate for the European countries.

The tests are as follows. Each structural and AR6 equation was
estimated 8 times, the first sample period ending 9 quarters before the end
of the data for the country, the second ending 8 quarters before, and so on.

For each set of estimates, outside sample forecasts were made. The forecast
period was 4 quarters. There were thus 8 one-quarter-ahead forecasts, 7
two-quarter-ahead forecasts, 6 three-quarter-ahead forecasts, and 5 four-

quarter-ahead forecasts. The same forecasts for the RW equations were made.

(The RW equations required no estimation. Each variable is simply equal to
its value last period. No constant term was included in RW equations.)
Root means squared errors were then computed for the forecasts. The results
for the interest rate are presented in Table 6, and the results for the

exchange rate are presented in Table 7. The interest rate errors are in
percentage points, and the exchange rate errors are percentage errors in
percentage points.

Consider first the interest rate errors. For the one-quarter-ahead
errors the structural model is best in 3 cases, the AR6 model is best in 7

cases, and the RW model is best in 6 cases. In one case the structural and
RW models tied. For the four-quarter-ahead errors the structural model is
best in 4 cases, the AR6 model is best in 7 cases, and the RW model is best

in 6 cases. The results are thus mixed, with the structural model doing
somewhat less well than the other two.

Consider next the exchange rate errors. For the one-quarter-ahead
errors the structural model is best in 11 cases, the AR6 model is best in 2

cases, and the RW model is best in 2 cases. In 2 cases the structural and
AR6 models tied. For the four-quarter-ahead errors the structural model is
best in 9 cases, the AR6 model is best in 4 cases, and the RW model is best

in 4 cases. The results are thus in general supportive of the structural
model over the other two.
Results like those in Tables 6 and 7 must be interpreted with

considerable caution. The estimation periods for the equations are short,
and there are at most only 8 outside-sample forecast observations. Also,
the simple comparison of outside sample root mean squared errors can be
13

improved upon, at least in the long run.

More observations are needed

before much can be said about either the interest rate or the exchange rate

equation. Nevertheless, one would certainly not conclude from the exchange
rate results that the structural exchange rate equation is poor relative to

the AR6 and RW equations. If anything, the reverse is true. Meese and
Rogoff's general conclusion for exchange rate equations thus seems too

l3with more observations one can use the method in Fair (1980) to
compare the alternative models. Unlike the simple RMSE comparison, this
method accounts for the fact that forecast error variances vary across time
and for the uncertainty from the exogenous variable forecasts. It also
accounts in an explicit way for the possible misspecification of the models.

pessimistic for the present equations. It may be that over time reasonable
structural exchange rate equations can be estimated.

APPENDIX

In order to solve the theoretical model in Section II numerically, one
needs to specify the functional forms and coefficients for equations (1),
(2), (3), (6), (7), and (10) and the equivalent equations for country 2.
The specifications used in this paper are the following:

(1) X — -40.0.P
(2) x — 40.O.p
(3) P —

.l0.e.p

40.0.e.p

1)

These same coefficient values have been used for country 2's equations.
The entire simulation model consists of the above equations, the

equivalent equations for country 2, and the definitions that are presented

in Section II. There are 34 independent equations altogether. Given values
for the exogenous variables, one can attempt to solve the model for the

endogenous variables. The "base" values that have been used in this study
are presented in Table A. The base values of the endogenous variables are
the solution values that results from solving the model using the base
values of the exogenous variables.

The coefficients in the above equations have been chosen to correspond

to particular elasticities at the base values. In equation (1) the price
elasticities are -1.0 and 1.0, the interest rate elasticity is -1.0, and the
income elasticity is 1.0. In equation (2) the four elasticities are -2.0,

2.0, -1.0, and 1.0. In equation (3) the import price elasticity is .1 and
the income elasticity is .1. In equation (6) the interest rate elasticity
is -1.0 and the income elasticity is .5. In equation (7), which is not an
important equation in the model, elasticities are not defined because the

base value of BO is zero. Coefficients of 50 and -50 have been used. In
equation (10) the interest rate elasticities are -1.0 and 1.0.
Suxmnary results from the experiments are reported in Table A. These

are the experiments discussed in Section II. Remember that lower case
letters denote variables for country 2, so that, for example, r is country
2's interest rate and y is country 2's GNP.
One should, of course, be aware of the limitations of theoretical

simulation models. Even though only the qualitative results are stressed in
this paper, the qualitative results are not necessarily robust to

alternative choices of the coefficients. At least some of the signs in
Table A may be reversed with different coefficients. The simulation model
is meant to help in understanding the theoretical model, but the results

from it should not be taken as evidence that all the signs in Table A hold
for all possible coefficient values.
