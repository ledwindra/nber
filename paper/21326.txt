Does Retirement Improve Health and Life Satisfaction?

NBER Working Paper No. 21326

JEL No. I10,I31,J26
ABSTRACT
We utilize panel data from the Health and Retirement Study to investigate the impact of retirement
on physical and mental health, life satisfaction, and health care utilization. Because poor health can
induce retirement, we instrument for retirement using eligibility for Social Security and employer
sponsored pensions and coverage by the Social Security earnings test. We find strong evidence that
retirement improves both health and life satisfaction. While the impact on life satisfaction occurs within
the first 4 years of retirement, many of the improvements in health show up 4 or more years later, consistent
with the view that health is a stock that evolves slowly. We find little evidence that retirement influences
health care utilization.

Introduction

Life expectancy has improved dramatically over the past half century. Conditional on turning 65,
men and women born in 1940 could expect to live for an additional 12.7 and 14.7 years, on average. In
contrast, men and women born in 1990 can expect to live an additional 16.1 and 19.5 years,
respectively.1 Since working lives have not kept pace with this increase in life expectancy, the length of
retirement has increased (see, e.g., Cushing-Daniels and Steuerle (2009); Milligan and Wise (2012)).
Faced with impending budget shortfalls in entitlement programs, this fact has led policymakers to raise
the normal retirement age for collecting some retirement benefits and increased interest in policies that
further extend working lives. Such policies are fiscally attractive as longer working lives can both reduce
benefits and increase tax revenue. Beyond their direct impact on revenue, they can also affect individual
health and well-being, and as a result they may have additional, indirect fiscal and individual impacts.
To fully evaluate the welfare and budgetary consequences of policies that extend the time that
individuals spend working, it is important to understand these indirect effects. For example, if
retirement worsens health and generates increased health care utilization, then policies that delay
retirement may further improve Medicare’s finances and make individuals better off. Alternately, if
retirement improves health, then policies that promote delayed retirement to shore up the fiscal budget
may have hidden fiscal costs and negatively impact individuals. To this end, this paper studies the effect
of retirement on the health and well-being of individuals and on their health care utilization, with the
latter providing a direct assessment of the impact of retirement on public health care expenditures.
There are a number of channels through which retirement might affect health and well-being. Some
channels imply that retirement has negative effects on health. For instance, if health is viewed as an
investment good that serves as an input into individuals’ market output (Grossman (1972)), then
retirement may reduce investment in health as these investments no longer affect the individual’s

wages in the labor market. In addition, unanticipated retirement that is associated with a negative
income shock could reduce subjective well-being and the ability to invest in health. Retirement can also
lead to social isolation and a diminished sense of purpose (Bradford (1979)), which may worsen health
and subjective well-being. On the other hand, several avenues imply a positive relationship between
retirement and health outcomes. Investment in health may increase as retired individuals have a lower
marginal value of time, making health investment less costly. Retirement also increases leisure, which
may reduce physical and mental stress, improving both subjective well-being and health.2
Likewise, the effect of retirement on health spending is also ambiguous, not only because health
care spending depends on health status but also because it may be an input into health outcomes. While
improved health in retirement may reduce health care utilization, if the improvement in health is the
result of increased investment in health, then health care utilization could increase. Similarly, a
worsening of health during retirement may be associated with either increases or decreases in health
care utilization over the life cycle.
Early studies on the relationship between retirement and health often find a negative correlation
(see, for instance, Dave et al (2008)). However, correlations between retirement and health or life
satisfaction do not indicate a causal effect of retirement because retirement decisions are endogenous.
In particular Dwyer and Mitchell (1999) have shown that individuals who experience negative shocks to
health or life satisfaction disproportionately select into retirement. In fact, McGarry (2004) argues that
health may drive retirement expectations to a greater degree than changes in income or wealth. In
addition, anticipated health changes due to retirement are likely to be factored into the individual’s
optimal choice of retirement date. Indeed, we find that retirement is correlated with negative health
outcomes in simple OLS specifications that do not control for endogeneity. We address this endogeneity
with panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) by instrumenting for retirement using age2

retirement.

based variation in eligibility for Social Security retirement benefits, applicability of the Social Security
earnings test, and eligibility for retirement benefits in an employer sponsored pension. We also account
for individual fixed effects. These age based retirement eligibility instruments should not be directly
correlated with health except through their effect on retirement behavior, as we would not expect
discrete jumps in health status at these ages beyond what is controlled for with age trends.
In addition to addressing endogeneity, we specify our model to study the post-retirement dynamics
of health and well-being. Dynamic considerations are important for both health and subjective wellbeing. Objective health indicators such as mobility restrictions and diagnosed conditions are stock
variables that respond slowly to changes in health investments. Thus, health effects may not show up
immediately upon retirement. In addition, a number of studies have demonstrated that subjective wellbeing tends to return to a baseline level after a life change.3 By studying dynamic changes after
retirement, we are able to detect changes in the stock of health and differentiate between short-term
and long-term effects that are obscured by only focusing on average changes.
Our instrumental variables estimates show that retirement improves both health and life
satisfaction. The improvements in life satisfaction and reported health are immediate and remain 4 or
more years after retirement. The improvements in objective health measures are not apparent
immediately, but show up 4 or more years after retirement. The delayed health impact is not surprising
considering that health is a stock variable that is unlikely to rapidly change over time. Because we are
able to analyze outcomes several years after retirement, we find significant improvements in objective
health measures that have not been detected in past studies.
In addition to studying the impact of retirement on health and well-being measures, we also
examine its impact on health care utilization. While past studies have focused only on changes in health
to assess likely changes in costs to the retirement system, we assess these costs directly. Estimating
3

(1996).

5
these changes is important for understanding how retirement policy will affect public health care
expenditures. Our estimates show no statistically significant effects of retirement on health care
utilization. Therefore, we can establish that post-retirement health gains are not likely to be driven by
increased use of the medical system and that the fiscal externalities from retirement on medical
expenses are unlikely to be large.
Many previous studies examine the impact of full or partial retirement on health and well-being,
with mixed results. However, only a subset of these studies carefully account for the fact that retirement
is endogenous. The studies that address endogeneity take a variety of approaches. Avorn and Soumerai
(1983) perform a small randomized trial. Other studies use broadly representative panel data, which
allows the use of individual fixed effects, or fixed effects augmented by conditioning on good initial
health.4 While this approach controls for unobservable, time-invariant health factors that may influence
future health shocks and retirement, it does not account for unexpected health shocks that induce
retirement. To estimate the causal impact in the presence of health shocks, another set of studies uses
instrumental variables. Instruments that are used for retirement include age-specific retirement
probabilities (Becchetti et al. (2012)), age-based retirement incentives in public and private pensions
(Horner (2014); Behncke (2012); Coe and Zamorro (2011); Rohwedder and Willis (2010); Neuman
(2008); Bound and Waidmann (2007); and Charles (2004)), changes in earnings test rules (Charles
(2004)), and early retirement offers (Coe et al. (2012); Coe and Lindeboom (2008)).
These instrumental variables studies consider a wide range of health and well-being outcomes,
including life satisfaction ratings, physical health, and mental health but their findings remain mixed. For
cognitive function, Coe et al. (2012) find that retirement has no statistically significant impact while
Bonsang et al. (2012) and Rohwedder and Willis (2010) find that it is associated with declines. Charles
(2004) focuses on the effect of retirement on two indicators for mental health and finds that retirement

6
improves in both indicators. For health, Neuman (2008) and Coe and Lindeboom (2008) find that
retirement improves individuals’ subjective assessment of their health, but not objective health
measures like indices for specific functional limitations, specific diseases, or scores on a depression
scale. Coe and Zamorro (2011) study several European countries and find that retirement improves
contemporaneous self-reported health outcomes, but has no effect on depression scales or cognitive
function. In contrast to these findings, Behnke (2012) uses both non-parametric matching and
instrumental variable specifications to find that retirement increases the risk of being diagnosed with a
chronic condition and worsens self-assessed health in the United Kingdom. Horner (2014) and Becchetti
et al. (2012) find that retirement improves subjective well-being among older Europeans, though Horner
finds that life satisfaction tends to return to baseline a few years after retirement.
Our paper extends and updates the results of Coe and Lindboom (2008), Charles (2004), and
Neuman (2008). Relative to these papers, we consider additional measures of health, as well as life
satisfaction indicators that were added to the HRS in 2004. To our knowledge we are the first to directly
study the impact of retirement on health care utilization, which is arguably the most important factor in
estimating the fiscal impact arising from the link between retirement and health. We also perform a
detailed analysis of the dynamics of post-retirement health and well-being by estimating the impact of
retirement immediately after retirement and in the period 4 or more years after retirement. In contrast
to Coe and Lindeboom (2008), we find that retirement has significant health effects in the long run. Our
approach to estimating dynamic effects on health and well-being differs from Coe and Lindboom (2008)
in several ways. First, we consider life satisfaction and health care utilization in addition to health.
Second, we assess how retirement generates changes in individual well-being by estimating a fixed
effects model. Fixed effects provide an additional control for time invariant endogeneity. Finally, our
larger sample size (with additional years of the HRS) allows us to estimate the impact of retirement

7
more precisely and to study dynamic effects over a longer time horizon. Thus, we find new statistically
significant long-run effects for objective health outcomes.

Data and Methodology

We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a biennial survey constructed to be
representative of Americans over the age of 50. The HRS spans the period between 1992 and 2012. The
survey began with an initial cohort of individuals and their spouses in 1992, and subsequent cohorts
were added to keep the sample representative of the target population. We keep the original HRS
cohort, the Children of the Depression and War Babies cohorts, which entered the sample in 1998, the
Early Baby Boomer cohort, which entered the sample in 2004, and the Mid Baby Boomer cohort, which
entered the sample in 2010. Most of the variables used in our analysis come from the RAND version of
the HRS, a cleaned dataset containing a subset of variables from the raw survey. However, the life
satisfaction variables and the eligibility ages for defined benefit (DB) pension plans are merged in from
the raw HRS. All of our analysis is performed at the person-wave level and utilizes the respondent-level
weights provided in the RAND dataset.
It is important to define retirement carefully for our analysis. We begin by selecting a sample of
individuals who report at least 20 years of work experience in the wave in which their cohort first
entered the survey (hereafter referred to as the baseline wave).5 Thus, our analysis excludes career
homemakers, for whom retirement status might not be very meaningful. In each wave, the RAND HRS
classifies individuals as either working full-time, working part-time, retired, partially retired, disabled,
unemployed or not in the labor force.6 We define retirement as a transition from working full- or parttime to full or partial retirement. We drop from the sample individuals who are disabled, unemployed,
or out of the labor force in any wave, individuals whose labor force status is missing in any wave, and
5
6

We drop individuals who did not respond, or who responded via proxy, in the baseline wave.
Individuals who are working part time but mention being retired are classified as partly retired.

8
individuals who shift from retirement to non-retirement at any point during the sample period.7
Individuals who are retired throughout the sample period are retained as long as they have a valid
retirement date in the RAND data in their baseline wave.8 We drop individuals whose first wave of
retirement occurred before the age of 50.
The HRS includes several summary measures of physical and mental health that are updated in each
wave. The first health measure we use is a self-reported health status, ranging from 1 (excellent health)
to 5 (poor health). While self-reported health measures can be problematic due to potential reporting
bias, they have an advantage of providing a measure of overall health and have been shown to be
correlated with mortality.9 The second is an index containing the number of major health conditions that
the respondent has ever had out of a possible eight, including high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer,
chronic lung disease, heart problems, stroke, psychiatric problems, and arthritis. The final summary
measure is a mental health score based on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD)
scale. It is the sum of six indicators of negative sentiments during the past week, plus the sum of one
minus two indicators of positive sentiment. The negative sentiments are feeling depressed, feeling that
everything is an effort, experiencing restless sleep, feeling alone, feeling sad, and being unable to get
going and the positive sentiments are feeling happy and enjoying life.10
In addition to the summary health measures, we study measures of overall life satisfaction. Starting
in 2004 (wave 7), respondents were asked a series of questions about life satisfaction. Studies show that
reports of subjective well-being are correlated with objective physiological and psychological measures.
Moreover, they are correlated with changes in circumstances and can impact future decisions. While
7

Maestas (2010) shows that “unretirement” is quite common and is generally planned in advance, although some
individuals who “unretired” do so because they realized that retirement reduced their happiness.
8
Retirement dates are used to compute the time since retirement for individuals who have been retired
throughout the sample. Within this subset of individuals, we drop those whose reported retirement date is after
the end date of their baseline interview. If retirement year is available but retirement month is missing, we set the
retirement month to June.
9
See Coe and Zamarro (2011) for a useful discussion.
10
A consistently measured CESD score is only available from wave 2 onwards.

9
these measures can be affected by short-term contexts or mood, these fluctuations should average out
and only add noise that makes significant findings less likely.11 In the HRS, respondents are asked to rate
their agreement with the following statements:


“In most ways my life is close to ideal.”



“The conditions of my life are excellent.”



“I am satisfied with my life.”



“So far, I have gotten the important things I want in life.”



“If I could live my life again, I would change almost nothing.”

In each case, the scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).12 To impute life
satisfaction scores for waves before 2004, we regress each life satisfaction measure on the individual
components of the CESD index, a set of dummies for self-reported health, the health care utilization
measures, indicators for Medicare and other health insurance coverage, the components of the major
health condition index, a set of dummies for each functional limitation index, and dummies for
education, race and Hispanic ethnicity, age, marital status, and gender.13 We substitute the predicted
values of the satisfaction variables whenever reported values are missing. In addition to the summary
health and life satisfaction measures, the HRS includes several objective health measures on functional
limitations. The first of these is the number of activities of daily living (ADLs) with which the respondent
has difficulty. The ADLs included in the index include bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed,

11

See Kahneman and Krueger (2006) for a more detailed overview of life satisfaction measures.
In waves 9-11, the options are strongly disagree (1), somewhat disagree (2), slightly disagree (3), neither agree
nor disagree (4), slightly agree (5), somewhat agree (6), and strongly agree (7). In wave 7, the scale is reversed,
with 1 corresponding to strongly agree and 7 corresponding to strongly disagree. We recode the wave 7
satisfaction variables to make them consistent with the other waves. In wave 7 as well, the “somewhat
agree”/”somewhat disagree” options are replaced with “agree”/”disagree.” In wave 8, the scale ranges from 1
(strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) because a “neither agree nor disagree” (corresponding to a score of 4 in
the other waves) option is not available. We rescale the wave 8 responses by multiplying them by 6/5 and
subtracting 1/5, a transformation that results in variables that range from 1 to 7.
13
For the imputations, we use all available observations on the cohorts included in the analysis (provided they
meet the sample selection criteria of being present in the baseline wave and having 20 or more years of work in
the baseline wave), not just the ones that were retained for the main regressions.

and walking across a room. The second is the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs)
with which the respondent has difficulty. IADLs include managing money, using the phone, and taking
medications. The third is the number of mobility limitations the respondent faces, including difficulty
with walking one block, walking several blocks, walking across a room, climbing one flight of stairs, and
climbing several flights of stairs. The fourth measure is an index of large muscle limitations, with one
point added to the index for difficulty with each of the following activities: sitting for two hours, getting
up from a chair, stooping, kneeling or crouching, and pushing or pulling large objects. Fifth, a gross
motor activity limitation index adds one point for difficulty with each of the following: walking one
block, walking across a room, climbing one flight of stairs, getting in or out of bed, and bathing. Finally,
an index of fine motor activity limitations adds one point for difficulty with each of the following tasks:
picking up a dime, eating, and dressing.14
Health care utilization variables include the number of hospital nights, nursing home nights, and
doctor visits; indicators for whether the respondent used home care or prescription drugs; and the
respondent’s self‐reported out‐of‐pocket health care spending. In wave 1, hospital nights, nursing home
nights, doctor visits, use of home care, and out‐of‐pocket spending are measured over the past year. In
subsequent waves, these variables are measured since the previous interview or in the past two years
for new respondents.15 Use of prescription drugs is only available for waves 2 and beyond, and it is
always measured since the last interview (or over the past two years for new respondents).
Table 1 shows summary statistics for the main variables used in the analysis. We have 41,316
observations that have non‐missing values for all the independent variables and instruments, as well as
non‐missing, non‐singleton values for at least one of the outcome variables. The first‐stage regressions
are estimated on all of these observations, while the second‐stage regressions use all available
observations for each outcome variable.
14
15

Consistently measured functional limitation indices are only available for wave 2 onwards.
We do not adjust for this difference in reporting periods as it should be absorbed by the wave dummies.

11
We wish to capture the effect of retirement (𝑅𝑖𝑡 ) on our measures of health, well-being, and health
care utilization (𝐻𝑖𝑡 ). That is, we wish to estimate 𝛽 in the following equation.
𝐻𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑅𝑖𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡
Because retirement status could be endogenous, we instrument for retirement using variation in
eligibility for Social Security and private DB pensions as well as applicability of the Social Security
earnings test. Early, but reduced, Social Security benefits are available at age 62. “Full” benefits begin at
the normal retirement age, which varies between age 65 and 66 for individuals in our sample,
depending on their birth cohort. Finally, a person can receive delayed retirement credits until age 70 by
postponing the start of Social Security benefits beyond full retirement age. Therefore, for the retired
status indicator, our Social Security eligibility instruments are a set of indicators for whether a personwave observation falls into each of the following age categories: below 62, 62 to normal retirement age,
normal retirement age to (but not including) 70, and 70 or older. Our DB eligibility instruments are a set
of dummies that indicate whether an individual who is covered by a current employer’s DB pension (as
of the baseline wave) is below the plan’s early retirement age, has reached the early but not the normal
retirement age, and has reached the normal retirement age.16 Our measure of “no earnings test” is an
indicator that takes on a value of 1 during a given wave if the individual is outside the age range that
would be subject to the earnings test for worker benefits. Prior to 2000, the earnings test applied to
workers between the ages of 62 and 70. In 2000 and later, the earnings test applied to workers between
the ages of 62 and their normal retirement age.

16

Depending on the baseline wave, an individual may report information on up to 3 or 4 current employersponsored pension plans. We use information in the RAND HRS to determine whether each plan is a DB, DC, or a
combination. Eligibility ages for each DB or combination plan come from the raw HRS. An individual is determined
to be eligible for an early (full) retirement if he or she has reached the lowest early (full) eligibility age for any of
the DB or combination plans reported. If an individual responds that the plan has no age requirement, the age
requirement is coded as zero. We also include an indicator for individuals who are covered by a DB or combination
plan but have an unknown eligibility status due to missing data. For some plans, the early retirement age is either
above the normal retirement or missing. In these cases, we replace the early eligibility age with the normal
eligibility age.

12
Variation in eligibility for Social Security and DB pensions presents a plausible set of instruments for
understanding how retirement influences health and well-being. With these instruments we are picking
up the effect of voluntary retirements around the age thresholds that we instrument for. Of course, if
there are different effects of retirement at different ages outside the window that we study, our model
is not informative about their effect. Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that discrete age
thresholds should directly influence health outcomes beyond the standard linear and quadratic trends in
age that are included in the specifications. Two possible exceptions to this are the dummy for normal
retirement age and the dummy for full DB pension eligibility. For around 42.5 percent of our sample,
Social Security normal retirement age is 65. In addition, many individuals are covered by a DB plan with
an early or full retirement age of 65. Since 65 is also the threshold for Medicare eligibility, reaching that
age could directly affect health care utilization and health. We address this issue by controlling for
Medicare and other insurance coverage in our regressions.17 This approach allows us to use the normal
retirement age threshold as an excluded instrument for the subset of individuals whose normal
retirement age is greater than 65. Finally, our first stage regressions show that our instruments are
strong predictors of individual retirement behavior.
The Social Security earnings test is also a plausible instrument as it effectively forces beneficiaries
who earn above a certain threshold to defer part or all of their benefit. While any foregone benefits are
received at a later date, with a relatively generous actuarial adjustment, there is evidence that most
people view the earnings test as a tax on work.18
Our first stage regression becomes:
𝑅𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑍𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼2 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖 + 𝑛𝑡 + 𝑒𝑖𝑡
17

The other health insurance coverage indicator takes on the value of 1 if the individual is covered by Medicaid,
CHAMPUS/VA, other (non-Medicare) government plan, current or former employer-sponsored plan, or other
private plan. It is set to zero if the individual is covered by none of these kinds of insurance. The other government
plan category is available for the first two waves only.
18
See Shoven and Slavov (2014a,b) for the actuarial calculations of the gains to delaying retirement. Friedburg
(2000) and Song and Manchester (2007) study the labor supply consequences of the earnings test.

13
where 𝑅𝑖𝑡 is an indicator for whether an individual is retired at time t, 𝑍𝑖𝑡 is the set of instruments
outlined above, 𝑋𝑖𝑡 is a set of controls for age, age squared, and indicators of Medicare or health
insurance coverage, and 𝑢𝑖 and 𝑛𝑡 represent individual and wave fixed effects.
We estimate first-stage linear probability models to explain retirement status indicators and then
use the predicted values from these regressions as instruments in the second-stage model as follows:
𝐻𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑅̂𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜈𝑖 + 𝜂𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡
where the dependent variable represents measures of health, life satisfaction, and utilization.19
To capture the average effect of retirement, we run regressions in which the key independent
variable is a dummy for retired status. Since we are interested in the dynamics of health after
retirement we also estimate specifications in which the post-retirement period is divided into two subperiods. The first sub-period comprises the first 2 waves of the survey in which a person reports being
retired, and it indicates that the individual has been retired for roughly 0-4 years. The second sub-period
includes all post-retirement waves beyond the second and indicates that the individual has been retired
for more than 4 years. This group includes people who have been retired between 3 and 19 waves (from
4-6 to 36-38 years); however, less than 1 percent of the sample has been retired for more than 13 waves
(24-26 years). For individuals who have been retired throughout the sample, the sub-period indicators
are assigned based on the number of months elapsed between the reported retirement date and the
interview date.
When instrumenting for the two phases of retirement – 0-4 years retired and 4+ years retired – our
instruments include indicators for being the specified number of years (0-4, or 4+) beyond each of the
threshold ages. The indicators included in each first-stage regression are shown in Table 2. When
instrumenting for the early stage of retirement, our no earnings test indicator takes on a value of 1 for

19

Because of the difficulty of estimating nonlinear models with fixed effects, we estimate linear regressions that
treat all of these dependent variables as continuous.

14
individuals who are either under 62 or 70-74 (before 2000) or 0-4 years past normal retirement age (in
2000 or later). When instrumenting for being 4 or more years post retirement, our no earnings test
indicator takes on a value of 1 for individuals who are either under 66 or older than 74 (before 2000) or
4 or more years past normal retirement age (in 2000 or later).

Results
a. Main Findings

Table 2 shows the results of our first-stage regressions. We report standard errors clustered at the
household level in parentheses and all regressions use the respondent-level weights provided with the
HRS. The coefficients in the first-stage regressions have the expected signs. Not being subject to the
earnings test reduces the probability of being in any phase of retirement. Reaching the Social Security
eligibility ages increases the probability of being retired. Being 0-4 years past 62 increases the
probability of having been retired for 0-4 years. The other Social Security eligibility indicators reduce the
probability of being in this phase of retirement, possibly indicating the popularity of retiring at 62 and
earlier. All of the Social Security eligibility indicators increase the probability of being retired for 4 or
more years. All of the DB eligibility indicators increase the chances of being in any given phase of
retirement. For the first two regressions (the retired status indicator and the 0-4 years indicator), the
coefficient on age is positive and the coefficient on age-squared is negative, indicating that the
probability of retirement increases with age at a decreasing rate. However, these signs are reversed in
the regression for the 4+ years indicator.20 The F-statistics for the excluded instruments are greater than
10 in all cases and exceed the Stock-Yogo critical values, which suggests that the instruments explain
20

We suspect that this is a compositional effect. Because retirement may be triggered by adverse health shocks, a
number of individuals die before reaching 4+ years post retirement. Moreover, our sample also includes individuals
who never retire. Thus, as age increases, the composition of the sample is likely to shift towards those who never
retire. Indeed, if the sample is restricted to individuals who are observed 4 or more years beyond retirement, the
coefficient on age becomes positive for all three regressions. These results are not shown but are available upon
request.

15
significant variation in retirement status and there will not be biased or inconsistent results due to weak
instruments.21
Table 3 shows the results for general health outcomes. The OLS estimates show that retirement is
associated with a statistically significant increase in the number of health conditions with which the
respondent has been diagnosed. The only positive association between retirement and health shows up
as a moderate reduction in CESD score. These negative effects are consistent with past literature that
does not account for endogeneity.
The IV estimates are substantially different, showing that retirement improves self-reported health
on average. It also has no statistically significant effect on the number of health conditions with which
the respondent has been diagnosed. An examination of the individual health conditions that make up
the index suggests that retirement has no statistically significant relationship with any of them (at the 5
percent level).22 These results are similar to previous studies that use the HRS. Coe and Lindeboom
(2008) and Neuman (2008) both find short term increases in subjective health, but no significant effects
on objective health measures. Unlike Coe and Lindeboom (2008), we find that retirement is also
associated with larger and statistically significant reductions in CESD score relative to OLS.23 This aligns
with the Charles’s (2004) results showing some significant improvements in reports of loneliness and
depression.
We expand on previous studies by looking more closely at a variety of life satisfaction measures.
Table 4 shows the results for these measures. Most of the OLS regressions show modest, positive
associations between retirement and life satisfaction. In the IV specifications, retirement has a much

16
larger impact on life satisfaction. Retirement increases agreement with the first three life satisfaction
statements by around half a standard deviation and increases agreement with the last statement by
about a fifth of a standard deviation (though the latter effect is only significant at the 10 percent level).
The IV estimates suggest that the impact of retirement is immediate and persists in the long run (in 4
out of 5 instances, the magnitude of the effect is larger in the long run). This finding is interesting as the
literature on life satisfaction often shows that people return to a set point of well-being or adapt after
life changing events and Horner (2014) suggests that the effects of retirement on well-being fade. Our
results, however, suggest that retirement has long lasting benefits to individual well-being.
Table 5 shows the association between retirement and functional limitations. The OLS results
suggest that retirement is associated with an increase in functional limitations, but the IV specifications
indicate that on average, there is no statistically significant association between retired status and
functional limitations. This aligns with results in Neuman (2008) and Coe and Lindeboom (2008) who
only look at changes shortly after retirement. The dynamic regressions, however, tell a more interesting
story. Most measures are actually associated with a short-run increase in functional limitations, but that
association disappears and most functional limitations indices significantly improve 4 or more years
after retirement. These results indicate that retirement does have positive effects on objective health
measures, but they take time to present themselves. The coefficients indicate statistically significant
long-run improvements in five out of six categories. This provides new evidence that retirement in the
US has positive effects on objective health measures.
Table 6 considers the impact of retirement on health care utilization. Given that the literature shows
no adverse health effects of retirement, one may conclude that utilization is not affected. However,
previous studies have not directly estimated this relationship. Moreover, measuring expenses directly is
useful as it is possible that retirees avoid health decline or see gains through increased use of the
medical system. Indeed, the OLS results suggest a positive relationship between retirement and the

17
number of hospital nights, nursing home nights and doctor visits on average. This shows up as a short
run effect and a possibly longer-term relationship between retirement and the number of hospital
nights and nursing home nights. However, the IV results show no statistically significant effect of
retirement on most measures of utilization either in the short-run or the long-run. The main exception is
a short-run reduction in the use of prescription drugs. The rest of the coefficients are not significant at
the 5 percent level. These results suggest that regardless of the impact of retirement on health, policies
that either delay or hasten retirement are unlikely to have much of a lasting, direct impact on health
care costs.
Finally, we examine the average impact of retirement on summary health measures for various
subsamples, including individuals with a high school education or less, individuals with physically
demanding jobs, women, nonwhite race or Hispanic ethnicity, and unmarried individuals. We do this by
interacting dummies for group membership (during the baseline wave) with our predicted retired status
indicator, then using both predicted retirement and its interaction with group membership as
instruments.24 Our results (not shown but available upon request) suggest that the coefficients on
retirement are not statistically significantly different for most summary health and life satisfaction
measures. This is in line with the findings of Coe and Lindeboom (2008) who find only a few differences
across occupation and education. There are, however, a few exceptions in our data. The number of
health conditions rises after retirement for the less-educated group, although the reduction in
depression scores is larger. The reduction in depression scores is larger for individuals with more
physically demanding jobs. Women experience a smaller increase in one of the life satisfaction measures
after retirement. Nonwhite race or Hispanic ethnicity is associated with a larger drop in depression

24

18
scores. Single people experience a larger drop in depression scores and a larger increase in two of the
life satisfaction measures compared to married people.25
Our results align with previous research as we do not find negative effects of retirement on a variety
of health measures, and we find improvement in self-reported health. However, our results extend
previous findings with evidence of improvements in objective physical and mental health measures in
addition to self-reported health and long lasting impacts that occur 4 or more years after retirement.
One explanation for these new results could simply be that our sample is larger, as it utilizes additional
waves of the HRS that were unavailable when earlier papers were written. The additional waves also
allow us to examine the impact of retirement further into the future, which is important given that
health is a stock that adjusts to investments slowly and many of the health improvements only occur 4
years or more beyond retirement. Another explanation might be that some of these studies consolidate
health outcomes into broader categories. For example, all of the dependent variables in Neuman (2008)
are indicator variables for whether a particular health measure improved between two waves. Since we
use the actual index number for these variables, we might be able to pick up on smaller changes in the
indicators relative to the other studies.
b. Robustness
One potential concern regarding our long-run results could be that they suffer from survivor
bias. That is, individuals who survive to 4 or more years post retirement are likely to be in better health,
biasing the results in favor of finding that retirement improves long-run health. To address this issue, we
re-estimate our results using only individuals who are observed until 4 or more years after retirement.
The results are not qualitatively different from those reported above. That is, retirement is still
associated with an overall reduction in depression scores and self-reported health, an increase in many
life satisfaction measures, a long-run reduction in most functional limitations, a short-run reduction in

25

We report here only the interaction term coefficients that are significant at the 5 percent level.

19
prescription drug use, and a short-run increase in out-of-pocket medical spending. Fewer of our
coefficients are statistically significant, however, possibly reflecting the reduction in power that comes
from a smaller sample.26
Another potential concern is that, because we use all available observations for each outcome
variable, the differences we find across outcome variables is driven by sample selection. To address this,
we re-estimate our results using only observations with no missing values. This results in a sample of
37,705 observations. Again, the results that are not substantially different from those reported above.
To test that our results are not driven by the way we define retirement, we re-estimate our results
defining partially retired individuals as working. That is, the definition of retirement is based solely on
whether an individual is working (either full-time or part-time), rather than on whether he or she selfidentifies as retired. Our results are generally similar.

We also estimate the average effects of

retirement with the inclusion of individuals who retire and return to work.27 If these are the individuals
for whom retirement does not have beneficial effects, leaving them out could bias our results towards
positive findings. However, the average effects remain similar when we include them in the sample.28

IV.

Conclusions

The question of whether retirement affects health and well-being is important not only when
making individual retirement decisions but also when designing public policies that influence retirement
behavior. As policymakers consider policies to further lengthen working lives and resolve shortfalls in
funding for public retirement programs, it is important to take into account the impact these policies
have on the health and well-being of working individuals. Moreover, changes in health due to

26

On the other hand, this specification suggests a statistically significant long run reduction in prescription drug
and home care use, and an average increase in nursing home nights.
27
Under this definition of retirement, we can only estimate average effects as defining time since retirement is
problematic for those who unretire.
28
Results from these robustness checks are not shown but are available upon request.

20
retirement can also influence health care utilization and therefore the solvency of programs that provide
health insurance to the elderly. This paper provides new evidence to address these questions.
Without taking the endogeneity of retirement decisions into account, early studies often find
negative impacts of retirement on health and well-being. Indeed, our OLS results confirm these findings.
More recent studies correct for selection into retirement and find that the effects of retirement on
objective health measures largely disappear, and that retirement improves self-reported health. Our IV
results also show increases in self-reported health and no negative effects on other measures. In
addition, by utilizing more recent data and studying dynamic changes in health outcomes, we find
improvements in long-term health outcomes that have not been found in past studies. This is the first
paper to discover positive long-term effects in measureable health outcomes for US retirees.
This evidence is consistent with the view that health is a stock variable that does not change
immediately upon retirement but rather evolves over time. If this view is correct, it is likely that a longer
horizon may uncover even more health benefits of retirement. Finally, consistent with improvements in
health during retirement, we provide direct evidence that retirement has no statistically significant
impact on health care utilization, at least in the long-run. That is, the health improvements that occur
after retirement are likely to come without added expenses.
