    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper argues that the typical household's saving is better described by a \"bufferstock\" version than by the traditional version of the Life Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis (LC/PIH) model.  Buffer-stock behavior emerges if consumers with important income uncertainty are sufficiently impatient.  In the traditional model, consumption growth is determined solely by tastes; in contrast, buffer-stock consumers set average consumption growth equal to average labor income growth, regardless of tastes.  The model can explain three empirical puzzles: the [1991]; the the 1930's; and the temporal stability of the household age/wealth profile despite the unpredictability of idiosyncratic wealth changes.\n\n",
