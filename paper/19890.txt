Central Clearing and Collateral Demand

NBER Working Paper No. 19890
February 2014
JEL No. G15,G20,G28
ABSTRACT
We use an extensive data set of bilateral exposures on credit default swap (CDS) to estimate the impact
on collateral demand of new margin and clearing practices and regulations. We decompose collateral
demand for both customers and dealers into several key components, including the “velocity drag”
associated with variation margin movements. We demonstrate the impact on collateral demand of
more widespread initial margin requirements, increased novation of CDS to central clearing parties
(CCPs), an increase in the number of clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized
and non-specialized types, and client clearing. Among other results, we show that system-wide collateral
demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether
or not the CDS are cleared. Given these dealer-to-dealer initial margin requirements, however, mandatory
central clearing is shown to lower, not raise, system-wide collateral demand, provided there is no significant
proliferation of CCPs. Central clearing does, however, have significant distributional consequences
for collateral requirements across various types of market participants.

Introduction
The recent G20 reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, launched in the aftermath of Lehman’s collapse (FSB, 2013), mandates
the clearing of standardized derivative contracts by central clearing parties (CCPs). Central clearing aims to reduce the likelihood and severity of
contagion effects in the OTC derivatives market. A CCP steps into bilateral
trades by means of novation, becoming the buyer to every seller, and vice
versa. By taking on and subsequently mitigating counterparty credit risk,
CCPs insulate their members from default losses. CCPs lower counterparty
exposures in part through margin requirements.
We provide an empirical analysis of the collateral requirements induced by broader application of margin requirements and central clearing, for
an actual network of bilateral CDS exposures as of 2011. We demonstrate
the impact on collateral demand of more widespread initial margin requirements, increased novation of CDS to CCPs, an increase in the number of
clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized and nonspecialized types, and client clearing. Among other results, we show that
system-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application
of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not CDS are cleared.
Given the new requirement for dealer-to-dealer initial margins, mandatory
central clearing is shown to lower system-wide collateral demand, provided
there is no significant proliferation of CCPs. Central clearing does, however, have significant distributional consequences for collateral requirements
across various types of market participants.
The increasing use of central clearing raises the importance of CCPs as
points of risk concentration. The US Financial Stability Oversight Council
has designated three CCPs as systemically important under Title VIII of the
Dodd-Frank Act. 5 Although CCPs may provide financial stability benefits
(IMF, 2010), some, for example Singh (2010b), have questioned the extent
to which CCPs tie up large amounts of valuable collateral.
A number of authors have assessed changes in collateral demand due to
mandatory central clearing, arriving at a broad range of estimates, recently
compiled by Sidanius and Zikes (2012). We contribute to this literature in
three ways.
First, we use a novel and comprehensive dataset of CDS bilateral exposures to assess the impact of various margining and clearing schemes on
collateral demand and its decomposition. Our sample, obtained from the
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), covers virtually all CDS
bilateral exposures on 184 reference entities representing 31.5% of the global
single-name CDS market as of the end of 2011. For each referenced name,
the data base comprises counterparties at a global level. This is in contrast

to the existing literature, which used aggregate bank data releases (Heller and Vause, 2012) or market-wide data (Sidanius and Zikes, 2012) at a
product-level (CDS and interest rate swaps), without capturing the effect of
the network structure of OTC markets and the heterogeneity of counterparty
portfolios. CDS are of particular interest because of their jump-to-default
risk and the correlation of credit risk with systemic risk.
Second, we study a variety of clearing schemes and market structures.
Previous work had studied only simplified market structures. As opposed to
prior research, our data enable us to model both dealers and their customers.
We are also able to capture the impact on collateral demand of the new
regulatory requirement for dealer-to-dealer (D2D) initial margins. From two
base cases, with and without D2D margins, we analyse four effects : an
increase in novation to existing CCPs, an increase in the number of clearing
members, an increase in the number of CCPs, and client clearing. (With
“client clearing,” dealers clear the derivatives portfolio of their client endusers.) The second and the fourth of these effects had not been examined
in the literature. Although the effect on collateral demand of increasing
the number of CCPs had been investigated by Duffie and Zhu (2011), that
study was severely limited by lack of access to bilateral exposure data. We
distinguish between the impact of adding “specialized” CCPs, as opposed to
“non-specialized” CCPs, which are shown to be substantially less efficient
in collateral use because of lost netting and diversification opportunities.
Third, we provide a fully elaborated margin model that enables us to
decompose margin demand both by trader type (customer or dealer) and by
margin type. Specifically, our margin model features portfolio-specific initial margins, a contract-specific short charge for net CDS sellers, the impact
of maintaining unencumbered assets in order to face daily variation margin calls, and the velocity drag of collateral movement within the financial
system. The last two of these components had not been examined. Velocity drag is shown to have a significant impact on collateral demand. Our
model captures how these components of margin demand incorporate the
effects of cross-counterparty netting and diversification, which change with
the clearing scheme.
Overall, we find that clearing more CDS leads to a much smaller change
in system-wide collateral demand than suggested by previous studies. Indeed, assuming that initial margin is required for dealers whether or not
their positions are cleared, we find empirically that central clearing actually
lowers collateral demand through the effect of multilateral netting, provided
there is no significant proliferation of CCPs.
We show that client clearing reduces system-wide collateral demand provided that dealers are able to re-use a large enough share of the collateral
that they receive from their clients. The drop in collateral demand is driven by cross-counterparty netting and by diversification benefits, both for
customers and dealers, and depends on the size of each investor’s portfo3

lio. Netting and diversification benefits outweigh increased initial margin
requirements for investors whose portfolios are large enough.
In sum, most of the increase in collateral demand associated with the
new regulatory environment for CDS is caused by an increase in the set
of market participants required to provide margin at standardized safe levels. Central clearing does not itself cause a major incremental increase in
collateral usage, unless there is a further proliferation of central clearing
parties. For a given level of protection against counterparty failure risk, the
key determinant of collateral demand is netting. Combining offsetting and
diversifying swaps in the same netting set causes a significant lowering of
collateral demand. Central clearing can either improve or reduce netting opportunities, depending on how much is cleared, how many CCPs are used,
and the degree to which the same swaps are cleared in different CCPs. Although every euro of variation margin paid by some market participant is
received by its counterparty, the need to retain buffer stocks of funds suitable
for variation margin payments and the frictional drag associated with the
“velocity of circulation” of margin funds between participants are important
components of the total demand for collateral.

Other Related Work
There is a growing literature on counterparty credit risk in OTC markets. Acharya and Bisin (2013) investigate theoretically the existence of a
counterparty risk externality on opaque OTC markets, which is shown to
be absent when a centralized clearing mechanism is implemented. Zawadowski (2013) models an OTC market in which unhedged counterparty risk
may lead to a systemic run of lenders in case of idiosyncratic bank failure.
Thompson (2010) studies the signaling incentives induced by counterparty
risk. Empirical evidence on the pricing of counterparty risk on the CDS
market have been provided by Arora et al. (2012).
Central clearing parties as a counterparty risk mitigation institution have
recently been studied theoretically and empirically. Biais et al. (2013) and
Koeppl et al. (2011) analyse theoretically the optimal design of incentivecompatible clearing arrangements. The working of clearing institutions during the October 1987 crash has been documented by Bernanke (1990).
More recently, clearing in derivative markets has been described by Pirrong
(2009) and Singh (2010a). Hull (2010) discusses the issue whether all OTC
derivative transactions can be centrally cleared.
Duffie and Zhu (2011) focussed on the netting efficiency of bilateral versus centrally cleared derivatives, and showed that reducing the proliferation
of CCPs also reduces counterparty exposure and collateral demand. Their
work has been extended by Cont and Kokholm (2012), who focus on assets
that are heterogeneous with respect to their risk characteristics, and by Anderson et al. (2013), who analyse netting efficiency with linked and unlinked
4

CCP configurations.
Our paper is most closely related to Heller and Vause (2012) and Sidanius and Zikes (2012), who estimate the system-wide increase in collateral
demand due to mandatory central clearing. We extend their work in several
respects. Rather that using simulated exposure data, we use actual bilateral
pre-reform exposure data. This enables us to distinguish between customers
and dealers and to account for actual netting and diversification benefits at
the level of bilateral portfolios. Because of the granularity of these data, we
are able to considerably refine the impacts of clearing schemes and market
structure. For instance, emerging client clearing practices had not before
been modeled, nor had the impact of the number of client clearing members
on collateral demand. Finally, from contract-level exposure data, our margining model enables us to document the netting and diversification benefits
of increased clearing, as well as the sizes of each component of collateral
demand. Among these, the velocity drag on collateral arising from variation
margin had not been formulated or estimated.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The exposure data
are first described (section 1). Then the baseline model for collateral demand
is presented (section 2), and its results are described (section 3). Finally, the
impacts of four alternative clearing models are analyzed (section 4).

The CDS exposure data
This section describes our data.

1.1

The bilateral exposure dataset

Our CDS bilateral exposure data are provided by the DTCC, as extracted from the Trade Information Warehouse (TIW). The snapshot of the
world CDS market is as of 30 December 2011 for a large number of major
reference entities. The TIW is a global trade repository covering the vast
majority of CDS trades worldwide, and virtually all recent CDS trades. This
data set is a legal record of party-to-party transactions, as the Warehouse
Trust Company (a subsidiary of DTCC which operates the TIW) is supervised by US regulatory authorities. In addition to capturing the reports of
dealers and banks, our dataset encompasses non-bank market participants
such as hedge funds, insurance companies, central counterparties and potentially some industrial corporations. The dataset is unique as it is truly
global. Whereas most regulators obtain exposure data from DTCC related
to their domestic reference entities or institutions only, the dataset used in
this paper has a global coverage.
Our sample covers 184 reference entities, including 9 G20 sovereigns, 20
European sovereign and 155 global financial entities. Overall, 885 counter5

parties have been active in at least one of these reference entities. Our dataset
contains the names of the reference entities, but the identity of the counterparties is anonymised. A total gross notional of USD 4.91 trillion of CDS is
covered by our sample. At the same date (30 December 2011) the total gross
notional of the global CDS market was USD 25.9 trillion (ISDA, 2012). Our
sample thus represents about 31.5% of the global single-name CDS market
and 18.9% of the total CDS market (including multi-name instruments).
We have deliberately excluded Asian names, so as to have a partition of the
set of reference entities into two subsets (European and American names),
which is useful when analysing the effect of separated central clearing. As
our empirical analysis relies on the use of CDS price data, all CDS for which
there is no available price time series on Bloomberg have been excluded.
For each reference entity, our dataset contains gross and net bilateral
exposures between any two counterparties. The overall network consists of
44,155 bilateral exposures on individual reference entities. Any bilateral exposure may result from several separate transactions, so that the number of
transactions covered is 503,119. We do not have access to additional information at a transaction level. For example, we know neither the date at which
a particular deal has been executed, nor the maturity (initial or remaining)
of each position. The market value of open positions is not available. 6
We have performed checks on data quality. We drop 328 bilateral exposures of a counterparty vis-à-vis itself. Such exposures involve 12 individual
counterparties, and are barely relevant for our purposes as they reflect aggregation inconsistencies at a bank level (an internal trade between two
accounts or two subsidiaries or other legal entities of the same firm).
We obtained daily CDS pricing from Bloomberg.

1.2

Empirical identification of CCPs

Our dataset includes a fraction of trades that are centrally cleared. Given
our focus on netting efficiency and collateral demand induced by the design
of clearing schemes, we devote careful attention to the identification of bilaterally and centrally cleared exposures in the dataset. We identify CCPs
from their business model by identifying institutions which have large gross
exposures but consistently zero multilateral net exposures on all reference
6. The dataset used in this paper is a sub-sample of the one used in Peltonen et al.
(2013), and is restricted to reference entities which are liquid enough so that time series
of prices or quotes exist at a daily frequency. A more thorough description of the data can
be found in this paper.

6

entities they are trading 7 . Among the 50 largest counterparties 8 (ranked by
gross notional amounts bought and sold), we identify two CCPs.
Descriptive statistics regarding these CCPs are provided in table 1. Out
of 184 single-name reference entities in the sample, 39 are centrally cleared.
CCP-cleared exposures represent 7.02% of the market gross notional amount
(at the same date, year-end 2011, the ISDA estimated the percentage of
CCP-cleared single-name CDS to be 8%, based on a broader sample - see
ISDA (2012)). For reference names that have some CDS cleared by at least
one CCP, on average 32% of the gross notional amounts are centrally cleared.
No CDS is cleared by both CCPs. We also find that one CCP only clears
European names whereas the other clears only North American and Latin
American names, which we shall call “American.”

8. The criteria for identifying CCPs are valid for institutions with an large activity
only. Indeed, we do observe a handful of much less active institutions trading one or two
CDS and having a zero multilateral net exposure. These institutions, however, are not
likely to be central clearing parties. Institutions below the top-50 trade gross buy and sell
notional below USD 3 bn.

As regards the characteristics of the clearable CDS, we observe 25 American names and 14 European names, which break down into 36 financial
names and 3 sovereign names (all in the American area). The median gross
notional amount of a cleared name is USD 13.5 bn, which is about 90% larger than the sample median, implying that clearable names are CDS with
large gross notional amounts traded.

The baseline case : the observed network

In the baseline case studied in this section, we focus on modelling collateral demand given the network of exposures observed in the data. In later
sections, we focus on the dynamics of collateral demand when the network of
exposures is altered as a consequence of increased novation to CCPs, under
a variety of alternative market structures.

2.1

Market participants, reference names, and exposures

Consider a set Ω = {1, . . . , n} of market participants—also referred to as
“investors", for simplicity—partitioned into two subsets based on their membership to one or several CCPs. Of these n investors, D institutions, called
dealers or clearing members, are members of at least one CCP, whereas n−D
institutions, called customers or end-users, do not have direct membership
to central clearing parties. In addition, there is a set of nCCP central counterparties that do not belong to Ω and K reference entities indexed by k.
The n × n bilateral exposure matrix for reference entity k is denoted Gk .
The (i, j) element of Gk is the gross CDS exposure sold by bank i to bank j
on k. It does not include exposures to or from CCPs. From Gk , a n × n net
bilateral exposure matrix, denoted
X k is constructed.
Each of its elements
n
o
k
k
k
is given by X (i, j) = max 0; G (i, j) − G (j, i) . Therefore, X k (i, j) = 0
whenever X k (j, i) > 0 for all i and j.

2.2

Collateral posting

We now turn to collateral posting in the baseline case. Collateral requirements are defined for four types of bilateral exposures, namely customerto-dealer, dealer-to-dealer, dealer-to-CCP and, for a small number of cases,
customer-to-customer. Our model accounts for both initial and variation
margins, and for collateral “drag” due to limits on the velocity of circulation of collateral. In addition, collateral posting on a bilateral basis differs
from collateral posting to a CCP.

2.2.1

Margin requirements

Margin requirements for all types of institutions are summarized in table
2, and are designed in the baseline case so as to reproduce widespread market
practices before mandatory central clearing is implemented. First, initial
margins are posted by customers to all their counterparties, whether dealers
or customers. In contrast, dealers do not post initial margins to customers.
Dealer-to-dealer initial margins are treated parametrically, so as to consider
both the case where they are zero (akin to the pre-reform case) and strictly
positive (as on-going regulatory reforms are set to require such margins
(BCBS, 2013)). In addition, dealers post initial margins to CCPs, whereas
CCPs do not post initial margins to them.

margin requirements for all possible pairs of trader types. In the baseline case and for alternative specifications, results are presented both with and without dealer initial margins,
thus enabling a reproduction of both the pre-reform and the post-reform cases.
Second, variation margins are posted for all bilateral exposures. They
are decomposed into a buffer of unencumbered assets maintained to meet
daily calls and a component accounting for the velocity of circulation drag
within the financial system.

2.2.2

Initial margins

Initial margins between any two parties are computed at a bilateral portfolio level. They are calculated as the sum of a risk-based component and a
short charge for net CDS sellers, in order to replicate current market practice (for example, LCH-Clearnet (2012)). We define the bilateral portfolio
Pij between any i and j as the K × 1 vector
n

o

Pij = X 1 (i, j) − X 1 (j, i) , . . . , X K (i, j) − X K (j, i) .
Component k of Pij is positive whenever i is a net seller to j on reference
entity k, and negative otherwise. Denote φtT (Pij ) the change in the market
value of Pij over the period of T days spanning between t − T + 1 and t. We
have :

φtT (Pij ) =

where pkt is the price of CDS k at date t. The initial margin to be posted by
IM , is the worst historical change in the value of P over
i to j, denoted Cij

any T -day period, computed over the last P ≥ T days. Thus :

IM

= φtT (Pij ) , where t∗ ≡ maxt∈{T +1,P } φtT (Pij ) .

(2)

This initial margin is computed from the time series of CDS price data.
Our calculation ignores the impact of reference entity defaults, of which
there are none in our sample period 9 .
In addition to this portfolio-based initial margin (which is equal for both
i and j), a short charge is added for bilateral net CDS sellers, in order to
mitigate jump-to-default risk. Initial margins computation differs for customers and dealers, as customers do not have access to central clearing and
post collateral bilaterally to all other institutions in Ω. Dealers post initial
margin only to central clearing parties and, to a specified extent, to other
dealers.
Regarding customers first, the total initial margins to be posted by any
customer i, denoted CiIM , is

The first term, in the sum over all counterparties, is the initial margin com∗

component is a short charge computed on the basis of all net bilateral short
exposures at a reference entity level, parameterized by αC . Here, υ C ∈ [0; 1]
is a parameter capturing the potential undercollateralization of bilaterally
cleared trades compared to centrally cleared trades 10 . A trade is fully collateralized whenever υ C = 1.
For dealers, assuming no rehypothecation, we have :
9. Another source of potential minor under-estimation of collateral demand stems from
the fact that, due to data limitations, each exposure X k (j, i) may aggregate CDS traded
at different dates and with different maturities. Thus CDS exposures which we consider
as fully offsetting may nevertheless give rise to collateral posting on actual markets, once
heterogeneity with respect to these two characteristics is considered.

where Pi,CCPh denotes the bilateral portfolio of a clearing member i vis-a-vis
CCP h. The first term in equation 4 corresponds to dealer-to-dealer initial
margins. The second term corresponds to margins posted to CCPs. Differences are twofold 11 , reflecting the fact that risk-management practices by
CCPs tend to be more conservative than those for investors. First, centrally
cleared trades are fully collateralized. Second, the short charge is different for
bilaterally and for centrally cleared trades, with typically 0 < αD < αCCP .
Furthermore, the introduction of different margin parameters for customers
and dealers (υ C and υ D for the under-collateralization, αC and αD for the
short charge) is justified on the grounds that a significant share of dealer
activity (for example market making and prime brokerage) does not generate sizeable potential future exposure in a medium-term perspective and is
thus subject to lower collateralization standards.
In later sections, we consider υ D < υ C and αD < αC . We also later
consider a base case in which υ D = 0 and αD = 0, that is, an absence of
dealer-to-dealer initial margins. Finally, one important feature of margins
computed according to equations 1 and 2 is that portfolio diversification
reduces initial margin requirements.

2.2.3

Variation margin

In order to be prepared to pay variation margins, a bank must have a
V M of unencumbered assets ready to be transferred.

Let us denote σ X k (i, j) the daily standard deviation of X k (i, j). For

portfolio, regardless of its counterparties, and is given by :

where κV M > 0 is a multiplier on the daily standard deviation of the portfolio of investor i. Equation 5 captures the benefits of portfolio diversification.
11. Other requirements for centrally cleared trades—such as a contribution for the maintenance of a default fund—are ignored.

2.2.4

Margin velocity drag

In addition to initial and variation margins, we model the collateral
“drag” caused by limits on the velocity of circulation. From the time that
it is committed to be transferred, and until it becomes unencumbered and
ready to deploy for the counterparty to whom it is transferred, variation
margin payments are assumed to be unavailable, and thus augment the
collateral demand by a “velocity drag” of amount

institution’s entire portfolio (regardless of the particular counterparties),
velocity drag depends on the structure of bilateral exposures. The magnitude
of velocity drag therefore changes when a CCP interposes between dealers’
exposures.

Results for the baseline case

In the baseline case, we focus on collateral demand given the network
of exposures observed in the dataset. Only 7.02% of these exposures are
cleared through one of the two existing CCPs. The set of dealers is the set of
clearing members observed in the dataset. We find that D = 14, in line with
anecdotal evidence according to which the CDS market is centered around
14 dealers (Brunnermeier et al., 2013). Comparative descriptive statistics for
dealers and customers are presented in table 3. Furthermore, in the baseline
case, the set of cleared exposures is left unchanged, as is the clearing scheme.

comparative descriptive statistics for dealers and customers. The D dealers are identified
by the fact that they belong to the existing central clearing parties. Dealers consistently

(including the CCP), which exists during the few days needed to liquidate
and replace exposures with a defaulted counterparty. We thus consider T = 5
days in the calculation of initial margins. Variation margins cover current
exposure arising between two margin calls, which usually occur at a daily
frequency. We calibrate the multiple on the daily standard deviation as
κV M = 2. Even if variation margins are called on a daily basis, a lag exists
between the time at which a party commits to pay and the counterparty
receives the variation margin payment. The velocity drag parameter (a multiple on the daily standard deviation of each bilateral portfolio) is set at
κD = 1.5.
The calculation of short charges on the market relies on the estimation
of wrong-way risk (credit event and counterparty default occurring simultaneously, see LCH-Clearnet (2012)). We adopt a simplified approach. Short
charges αC and αD for both customers and dealers are assumed to be equal
to 1% of their net bilateral notional exposure. CCPs are assumed to take a
more conservative stance and require αCCP = 0.02.
The level of under-collateralization for customers is set to υ C = 0.75, in
line with the figure provided by ISDA (2011) for the whole OTC derivatives
market. We assume a lower collateralization level of υ D = 0.5 for dealers,
based on the view that a sizeable share of dealer activity, including market
making and their role as intermediaries, does not generate genuine medium-

13

term bilateral exposure. Finally, we assume no rehypothecation (ρ = 0) in
the base case. These baseline parameters, and alternative specifications, are
summarized in table 4.

Table 4 – Calibration for the baseline model and alternative specifications.
This table presents the calibration used both for the baseline model and for alternative
specifications. The baseline model derives from the pattern of exposures observed in the
data, without changes in the clearing scheme or in the clearable CDS.

3.2

Collateral demand decomposition, with and without dealerto-dealer initial margins

We consider the magnitude and decomposition of collateral for two calibrations of the baseline case alternatively. First, when υ D = 0 and αD = 0,
dealers do not post initial margin to each other. Second, when υ D > 0
and αD > 0, we focus on the dynamics of collateral demand once dealerto-dealer initial margins become mandatory. The first scenario is akin to
the pre-reform case ; the second resembles the post-reform case. Each of the
baseline cases is designed to investigate the impact of gradual or outright
changes in novation to CCPs and in clearing schemes, both pre-reform and
post-reform.
The decomposition of collateral demand both with and without dealerto-dealer initial margins is presented in the first two columns of figure 11.
In the absence of dealer-to-dealer initial margins, 68.9% of total margin is
posted by customers in the form of initial margins (including the short charge
component). Margin posted by dealers to CCPs accounts for only 7.6% of the
system-wide collateral demand. The variation margin component, including
velocity drag, accounts for 23.4% of the system-wide demand for collateral.

14

The velocity-drag component is 2.2 times the component associated with
the precautionary stock of unencumbered assets.
The introduction of dealer-to-dealer initial margins increases total collateral demand by 76%. The increase is purely due to dealers’ collateral
demand, which increases by a factor of 10.9, then representing 47.5% of
system-wide collateral demand. As regards the decomposition, note that the
short charge component of initial margins is relatively more important for
dealers (48.6%) than for customers (30.0%). This is due to the fact that dealers manage larger CDS portfolios than customers, therefore enjoying larger
diversification benefits on the part of their initial margin requirement computed at a bilateral portolio level (equation 2). The definition of the short
charge, on the contrary, excludes diversification benefits, and thus represents
a larger share of margins demand for dealers.
In terms of magnitude, without dealer-to-dealer initial margins, systemwide collateral demand is about 4.6% of the market-wide net notional positions and 0.35% of the market gross notional positions. With dealer-to-dealer
initial margins, collateral demand rises to 8.1% of net notional and 0.62%
of gross notional.

Table 5 – Change in collateral demand from baseline cases. This table contains
estimates of changes in total collateral demand when shifting from two base cases (with
and without dealer-to-dealer initial margins) and no central clearing to full central clearing with and without client clearing. Only exposures which are already cleared in the
dataset are centrally cleared in the base cases. "IM" stands for "initial margins", "C" for
customer, "D" for dealer. The computation of the change in collateral demand by type of
exposures excludes variation margins, as such margins are not allocated counterparty by
counterparty, but at a portfolio level.

3.3

Portfolio margin assumptions

In this subsection, we analyse the sensitivity of collateral demand to the
initial margin model. The number of days T on which the worst historical
change in portfolio value φT (Pij ) is computed (equation 2) is varied between
15

3 and 10 days. The appropriate choice of T for this purpose has been a
matter of some disagreement between regulators and market participants in
the United States.
Our results depend on the “clearing threshold,” defined as the level of
gross notional amount of CDS outstanding for a given reference name at
or above which CDS for that reference name are assumed to be centrally
cleared. Figure 1 plots total collateral demand, broken down between dealers
and customers, for a given clearing threshold. From the baseline case (T =
5), an increase in the initial margin computation period to 10 days yields
an increase in collateral demand by 27.7% for dealers and by 21.4% for
customers. Therefore, without any change in the clearing requirements, a
slight change in the initial margin model may have a sizeable impact on
collateral demand. Moreover, the slope of the initial margin demand curve
when T is varied is steeper for customers than for dealers. Such highest
sensitivity is explained by the fact that customers typically manage smaller
CDS portfolios (table 3) and therefore enjoy lower diversification benefits.

Rehypothecation

In the market for bilaterally cleared derivatives, rehypothecation of received collateral is common (Singh, 2010b). In this section we analyse the
effect of rehypothecation or other repledging practices on total collateral
demand. We denote by ρ ∈ [0; 1] the “rehypothecation ratio,” that is, the
proportion of received collateral that a bank may re-use. We assume that
only dealers can re-use initial margin received from others. For dealer i, the
total initial margin requirement, net of rehypothecated collateral, ĈiIM , is

Here, the collateral drag arising from rehypothecation is ignored.
The impact of rehypothecation on collateral demand in the baseline case
is illustrated in figure 2. In the presence of dealer-to-dealer initial margins for
uncleared trades, the impact of rehypotecation on dealers’ collateral demand
is sizeable. Initial margins decrease linearly with ρ (up to the point where,
P

for a bank i, ρ D
d=1 Cdi > Ci ). When ρ = 0, dealers’ collateral demand
is 4.2 times higher than when ρ = 1. A detailed assessment of collateral
needs implied by mandatory central clearing should therefore rely on an
appropriate account of rehypothecation in the baseline case. The effect of
increased central clearing on collateral demand, with varying levels of ρ, is
investigated in the next section.

4

Alternative clearing schemes

In this section, we investigate alternative structural assumptions for central clearing. We focus on the impact on collateral demand of (i) increasing
novation to CCPs, (ii) increasing the number of CCP members, (iii) increasing the number of CCPs, and (iv) introducing client clearing services.

4.1

Increased novation to CCPs

This section focuses on the impact on collateral demand of increased
central clearing. The market composition of customers, dealers and CCPs,
is kept at the baseline case. Ongoing reforms require central clearing for
derivative contracts which are sufficiently standardized. 12 We assume two
requirements for a CDS exposure to be novated to a CCP. First, a CDS
contract must be sufficiently actively traded. We assume that a reference
entity is eligible for central clearing when its global gross notional amount
12. Standardization criteria still to be defined. In the case of Europe, see ESMA (2013).

is above a threshold T̄ , which can thus be interpreted as a proxy for standardization. By dialing T̄ down, the gradual shift from the pre-reform to
the post-reform case is mimicked. Our dataset indeed (section 1.2) suggests
that names with larger gross notional amounts traded have been cleared
first by dealers, so that T̄ is a reasonable proxy for “clearability.” Second,
whenever a reference entity is eligible for central clearing, only trades above
a threshold t̄ are cleared. A justification for t̄ > 0 is that there may exist
exposure-specific fixed costs associated with central clearing (data processing, information requirements). Formally, whenever

We make additional assumptions on the assignment of particular exposures to CCPs. Consistent with the pattern observed in our dataset, we
assign each CDS reference entity to one of the two existing CCPs, based
on a European/American geographical breakdown (see section 1.2). All European (including European Union, Norway, Russia and Switzerland) CDS

reference entities are cleared by the existing European CCP, while all American (including Canada, Central and Latin America, and the United States)
reference entities are cleared by the existing American CCP. One CDS reference entity is never cleared by more than one CCP. The case in which
multiple CCPs may clear the same CDS is investigated in a later section.
Increased novation to CCPs has opposing effects on collateral demand.
On the one hand, bilateral dealer-to-dealer exposures which were not subject
to initial margin requirements, or which were left under-collateralized to
the extent captured by υ D , are now subject to full margin requirements.
On the other hand, increased novation implies larger portfolios Pi,CCPh for
any i and h, therefore potentially increased cross-counterparty netting and
diversification benefits.
Figure 3 plots the decomposition of system-wide collateral demand when
the central clearing threshold T̄ is reduced from that of the base case (USD
305 billion) to 0 (that is, full clearing), both with and without dealer-dodealer initial margins. In the absence of dealer-to-dealer initial margins,
total collateral demand increases by about 29% when shifting from the baseline scenario to full CCP clearing. This increase is driven by dealer initial
margins and short charges, as well as by the velocity drag of collateral. Customers’ collateral demand is unchanged at this stage as they are not clearing
members (client clearing is investigated below).
Whereas dealer initial margins and short charges increase, the velocity
drag decreases, due to the fact that increased central clearing amounts to
pooling multiple bilateral exposures with one counterparty, therefore reducing the number of bilateral links and increasing netting opportunities. Accounting for changes in the velocity drag of collateral is therefore important,
and had not been considered in previous research on collateral demand. A
failure to account for velocity drag would result in an over-estimate of the
increase in collateral demand implied by the shift to mandatory central clearing.
At a system level, the rise in collateral demand is found to be smaller than
estimated by previous empirical studies. This increase amounts to 0.1% of
the gross market notional, below the lower bound provided by Singh (2010b),
who estimates this increase at between 0.16% and 0.33% of the gross market
notional. Heller and Vause (2012), who study the whole CDS market for G-14
dealers only, provide estimates that depend on the prevailing level of market
volatility. With the most conservative hypothesis, they estimate additional
initial margin requirements to be above 100 bn USD. A linear extrapolation
of our results (as we consider a subset of the CDS market only) yields a much
lower estimate for the impact of central clearing on collateral demand.
Although collateral demand by customers does not change with the implementation of full clearing, dealers experience an increase in collateral demand of 134%, (see table 5) from the low “pre-reform” level. Second, among
dealers, the increase in collateral demand ranges between 57.5% and 519.7%,

Figure 4 – Change in dealers’ collateral demand as a function of T̄ . This

when novation to CCPs is increased. The above chart features a base case with no dealerto-dealer initial margins. The second chart features a base case with dealer-to-dealer initial

depending on the size and composition of the dealer’s CDS portfolio. Figure
4 decomposes the change in collateral demand for the 14 dealers. As can be
seen, the velocity drag component decreases when central clearing increases,
but this effect is more than offset by the increase in initial margin and
short charge. When T̄ decreases, the short charge increases faster than the
primary initial-margin component, because the short-charge computation
formula does not allow for the increasing potential effect of diversification
as portfolio size increases.
Turning to the case in which dealers post initial margins between themselves, increased central clearing reduces total collateral demand whenever
these dealer-to-dealer initial margins (parameterized by υ D ) are high enough. At the level of individual positions, increased central clearing implies
higher initial margin requirements. At a portfolio level, however, these higher collateral costs are more than offset by the cross-counterparty netting
and diversification benefits of a CCP. With υ D = 0.9, the system-wide collateral demand when shifting from the baseline case to full clearing is found
to decrease by about 27%. In such a case, collateral demand by dealers falls
by about 49%, with individual dealer-level impacts ranging from −24.8%
and −65.2%.
Finally, we focus on the case in which dealer-to-dealer initial margins
can be repledged (equation 8). This amounts to analysing repledging in the
post-reform case. Figure 5 plots dealers’ collateral demand as a function of
T̄ for five values of ρ ranging between 0 and 1. The slope of total collateral
demand is found to depend importantly on the rehypothecation ratio. When
repledging is not allowed (ρ = 0) or allowed only to some limited extent,
the collateral demand by dealers decreases when central clearing increases.
In policy terms, dealers are given an incentive to novate a larger share of
trades to CCPs under these conditions. When ρ is high enough, however,
this effect is reversed and novation to CCPs does not provide high enough
netting and diversification benefits to outweigh the loss of rehypothecation
benefits. Interestingly, for a fairly broad range of values for ρ (e.g. 0.5 or
0.75), collateral demand is not a monotonic function of T̄ , as the benefits
of central clearing outweigh the loss of rehypothecation benefits only when
the share of centrally cleared trades is high enough.

Figure 5 – Collateral demand as a function of ρ and T̄ . This chart shows
collateral demand by dealers when the clearing threshold T̄ is varied, for five values of the
rehypothecation ratio ρ. The base case is with dealer-to-dealer initial margins. The sign of
the change of total collateral demand depends on the extent to which rehypothecation is
practiced. Collateral demand by dealers drives the system-wide effect on demand in this
setup.

25

i. Market participants for which this exposure is above some threshold are
gradually assumed to become members of the two existing central clearing
parties, and are then effectively treated as dealers.
The increase in the number of clearing members has a non-trivial effect
on the global demand for collateral. On the one hand, there are benefits from
acquiring a dealer status, as dealers do not post initial margins to customers,
and post no margins to other dealers in the base case (if υ D = 0) or reduced
margins (whenever υ D < υ C ). On the other hand, central clearing may be
associated with higher collateral requirements than bilateral clearing for a
given set of exposures (whenever υ D < 1). Finally, central clearing may offer
both cross-counterparty netting opportunities and diversification benefits,
especially for institutions with a large number of bilateral counterparties.
Which of these effects dominate depends on the CCP-clearing threshold T̄ ,
that is, on the share of cleared trades.
Figure 6 plots total collateral demand as the number D of clearing members and the clearing threshold T̄ are varied. For a high CCP-clearing threshold (that is, a low share of centrally-cleared trades), an increase in the
number of clearing members lowers total collateral demand. When a strongly increasing share of trades being centrally cleared, total collateral demand
no longer depends monotonically on the number of clearing members. This
effect is further illustrated in figure 7, where initial margins (including the
short charge) delivered by customers to dealers and by dealers to CCPs are
decomposed for three values of T̄ as the number of clearing members is varied. The increase in dealer-to-CCP initial margins is offset to a large extent
by a shrinkage in customer-to-dealer initial margins, but the overall effect
on collateral demand depends on T̄ .

4.3

Number of CCPs

In this subsection, we focus on the loss of netting efficiency due to increasing the number of CCPs. In contrast with the existing literature (Duffie
and Zhu, 2011), where the increase in the number of CCPs is investigated
regardless of CCP specialization in subsets of CDS reference entities, we
distinguish two cases. CCP specialization is a common market practice, as
documented in section 1.2.
First, the set of reference entities, partitioned in the baseline case between European and American names, is further split. We create one new
CCP for each geographic area. Each CDS reference entity is randomly made
eligible by one of two area-wide CCPs, with equal probability of assignment.
One characteristic of such a clearing scheme, similar to the baseline case,
is that a CDS can be cleared at one CCP only. Such CCPs are here called
include the number of traded CDS or the number of counterparties. Spearman rank correlation with the total gross notional traded are respectively 0.77 and 0.84.

model. Results for T̄ = 305 bn USD correspond to the baseline case.

“specialized,” as there is no overlap in the set of reference entities cleared
by each of them.
Second, we consider the case in which multiple CCPs clear the same CDS,
within a given geographical area. Two new CCPs are added, with the same
coverage and eligibility critera as those described for the baseline model.
Whenever an exposure between any two dealers meets the eligibility criteria,
it is randomly novated to one of the two CCPs, with equal probability. Such
CCPs are called “non-specialized,” given the overlap, at an area level, in the
set of reference entities cleared by each of them.
In figure 8, total collateral demand with four specialized and non-specialized
CCPs is compared with collateral demand when there are two CCPs only.
The results are presented for base cases, without and with dealer-to-dealer
initial margins. First, in both cases, an increase in the number of CCPs
reduces the netting and diversification benefits of a reduced set of CCPs,

of T̄ . D = 14. In the first chart, there are no dealer-to-dealer initial margins. In the
second chart, dealer-to-dealer initial margins exist with υ D = 0.5 and αD = 0.01. For

simulations. Other calibrations are those of the baseline model. Results for T̄ = 305 bn
USD correspond to the baseline case.

therefore implying a higher collateral demand regardless of the clearing threshold T̄ . Second, whereas specialized CCPs imply only a loss of diversification benefits, non-specialized CCPs imply both netting and diversification
losses. Thus, collateral demand increases to a much larger extent with nonspecialized CCPs. With full clearing, an increase in the number of CCPs
from 2 to 4 results in a 7.2% increase in collateral demand if CCPs are specialized, and otherwise an increase of 22.4%. In order to gauge the impact
of CCP proliferation on collateral demand, it is thus crucial to account for
the degree of specialization of the proposed new CCPs.
For the case of non-specialized CCPs, we consider the baseline case with
dealer-to-dealer initial margins (second chart on figure 8). Here, total collateral demand is not monotonic in the clearing threshold T̄ . An increasing degree of novation to CCP first raises collateral demand, as additional
margin requirements and the change in netting sets outweigh the potential
cross-counterparty netting and diversification benefits a CCP may provide.
Once a large share of trades are cleared, however, these benefits prevail and
collateral demand decreases relative to the base case.

4.4

Client clearing

In the preceding sections, only dealer-to-dealer trades were centrally
cleared. However, all—or most—trades, including customer-to-dealer trades,
are required to be centrally cleared in the post-reform regime. To face this
constraint, a large number of institutions with a relatively low level of activity on the CDS market are not likely to become direct clearing members, as
the implied costs (compliance to prudential standards, contribution to the
default fund, etc.) may outweigh the benefits of central clearing. Such institutions are thus likely to use instead client clearing services. Client clearing
services are typically offered by large CCP members to smaller market participants. A dealer offering client clearing services collects margins from its
clients, in order to meet margins calls by the CCP. Client clearing services
allow a large number of investors to trade over-the-counter derivatives without being a member of a CCP, even though central clearing is mandatory.
We refer to dealers offering client clearing services as “client clearing
dealers.” Each customer is assumed to have its entire CDS portfolio cleared
by a unique client clearing dealer. In order for a customer-to-dealer trade to
be centrally cleared, client clearing services cannot be offered by the dealer
which is counterparty in the CDS trade, as there would then be no room
for a CCP interposing between the two institutions. For each customer, a
client clearing dealer is randomly assigned (with equal probability) among
the set of clearing members to which it has no direct exposure. In case a
customer is linked to all D dealers, the one to which its exposure is the
lowest (as measured by the number of CDS trades) is assigned as its client
30

clearing dealer. Direct exposures to this client clearing dealers are assumed
to remain uncleared. In the dataset, we find 32 such customers, and their
exposure remaining uncleared represents 0.03% of the sample gross notional
amount.
When posting collateral to their client clearing dealer, customers are
assumed to post (on that part of their portfolio which is eligible for clearing)
the amount of collateral they would deliver to a CCP in case they were direct
members. This amounts to setting υ C = 1 and αC = αCCP in equation 3,
thus requiring higher collateralization, ceteris paribus, for a given portfolio.
However, customers also enjoy potential netting and diversification benefits,
as trades with several counterparties are pooled to one dealer. Whether one
effect or the other dominates depends on the size of the portfolio of each
customer, as we shall emphasize later.
In this model, dealers clear the portfolios of their clients together with
their own CDS portfolio. Thus, they enjoy potentially large netting and diversification benefits on their own initial margin requirements. However, as
the size of their portfolio under management is larger, margin requirements
in absolute terms are likely to be larger. We assume that dealers can immediately re-use a fraction λ of the collateral supplied to them by customers. In
the absence of regulatory constraints, λ could be below one if client-clearing
dealers offer collateral transformation services or if CCPs accept a narrower
range of assets as collateral compared to the range accepted by dealers (or
if CCPs impose tougher concentration limits on the share of particular assets to be delivered as margins). We note the distinct roles of λ and ρ, as
the former concerns only collateral received through client clearing services,
whereas ρ is related to collateral received from dealers on uncleared trades.
Total collateral demand in the presence of client clearing is compared
with the baseline case in figure 9, both with and without dealer-to-dealer
initial margins. In both cases (with minor exceptions for high values of T̄ ),
implementing client clearing reduces collateral demand at a system level,
provided that λ is high enough. The system-wide effect is driven by several mechanisms. First, customers face higher initial margin requirements
at a position level, as exposures toward client-clearing dealers are assumed
to be fully collateralized (υ C = 1). However, as all their bilateral exposures are pooled towards their client-clearing dealers, they also enjoy crosscounterparty netting and diversification benefits. Which of these effects dominates depends on the size and composition of the CDS portfolio under
management, as discussed below.
Turning to dealers, two potentially offsetting effects are at play. Larger
portfolios must be centrally cleared by dealers at CCPs, implying higher
collateral requirements in absolute terms. However, these larger portfolios
offer increased netting and diversification benefits. This is likely to be even
more the case when a sizeable share of dealers’ exposures arises from their
market making or intermediary activity, thus allowing for large cross-client

system-wide collateral demand with and without client clearing for two base cases with
a varying CP-clearing threshold T̄ . In the first chart, there are no dealer-to-dealer initial
margins. In the second chart, dealer-to-dealer initial margins exist with υ D = 0.5 and
αD = 0.01. Both are calibrated with λ = 0.5. Results for T̄ = 305 bn USD correspond to

Figure 10 – Distributional effects of client clearing. The first chart pictures
the distributional effects of client clearing, as captures by the ratio of collateral demand
with client clearing over collateral demand in the baseline case. In the first chart, the
baseline case does not feature dealer-to-dealer initial margins for uncleared trades. In the
second chart, dealer-to-dealer initial margins exist with υ D = 0.5 and αD = 0.01. Both
are calibrated with λ = 0.5. Percentiles are constructed based on each counterparty’s total
gross notional bought and sold on the CDS market.

netting benefits. Whenever dealers re-use a high enough share of the collateral that they receive from their clients, the latter effect dominates. In
the absence of dealer-to-dealer initial margins (and λ = 0.5), total collateral demand decreases by 14.7% when shifting from the baseline case to full
clearing (compared to an increase by 29% in the absence of client clearing).
Both with and without dealer-to-dealer initial margins, system-wide collateral with client clearing for T̄ = 0 is 21.5% lower compared to a case with
full clearing but no client clearing.
In this setting of client clearing, and in the absence of dealer-to-dealer
initial margins, total collateral demand is not monotonic in T̄ , as seen in
figure 9. From the base case, increasing central clearing increases collateral
demand, with the effect being driven by dealers (as uncollateralized trades
become subject to initial margin requirements). When the share of cleared
trades is high enough, the netting and diversification benefits of client clearing (together with those of central clearing) outweigh these costs, so that
collateral demand decreases. Thus traders may favour large-scale—rather
than gradual—novation to CCPs.
At the level of a particular market participant, whether collateral demand decreases or not is ultimately driven by the size and composition of
the portfolio under management, as well as by the parameter λ (for dealers).
Whereas the previous analysis has focused on aggregate collateral demand
only, we here go to a more granular level by investigating the distributional
effects of client clearing across market participants. Given the anonymization
of market participants in the dataset, one approach to distinguish counterparties can only be according to their total level of activity (or, eventually,
other portfolio-related characteristics). Counterparties are ranked according
to the sum of the gross CDS notional amount they buy and sell on all underlying reference entities. Quantiles are constructed on this basis.
The distributional effects of client clearing are depicted in figure 10,
where the ratio of collateral demand in the presence of client clearing over the
demand in the base case is plotted for three values of the clearing threshold
T̄ . We see first that the distributional effects of client clearing, and whether
particular sets of institutions must post more or less collateral compared
to the baseline case, depend importantly on the share of cleared trades
captured by T̄ . Customers in the lowest quantile must always post more
collateral with the implementation of client clearing, because their increased
margin requirements outweigh cross-counterparty netting and diversification
benefits. This arises from the fact that they trade relatively few CDS with a
very small number of counterparties. At the other end of the size spectrum of
market participants, dealers always benefit from client clearing (for λ = 0.5)
even when T̄ is high. In the range between these values, for large customers
(market participants 15 to 200), whether netting and diversification benefits
are sufficient to offset increased initial margins or not depends importantly
on T̄ .

Conclusion
Our model and empirical analysis of extensive bilateral CDS exposure
data allows a decomposition of collateral demand for both customers and
dealers into four components. We investigated the relative and absolute impacts on collateral demand of four models of central clearing. The collateral
decomposition for the most salient specifications of each of these models is
summarized in figure 11.

Figure 11 – Summary of the results. This chart summarizes the decomposition of
system-wide collateral demand under six scenarios. The results are presented as a percent
of the system-wide net notional exposure. "D-to-D IM" denotes dealer-to-dealer initial
margins. All calibrations are those used in the models’ respective sections and summarized
in table 4.

Among our main results is the fact that, from end-2011 data, mandatory
central clearing has lower system-wide consequences on collateral demand
than previous studies suggest, but has large distributional consequences.
Conditional on all CDS being centrally cleared, both the risk model used to
compute initial margins and the exact type of prevailing market structure
are shown to have sizeable effects on collateral demand and decomposition.
Our analysis provides a distinction, when considering the impact of CCP
proliferation on collateral demand, between specialized and non-specialized
CCPs. We show the large cross-counterparty netting and diversification benefits that central clearing provides to dealers, and its distributional effects
35

on customers, which depend on the size of the portfolios that they manage.
We have also analyzed, for the first time, the effect on collateral demand
of client clearing. Our results indicate significant distributional consequences
of this emerging market practice.
