The Effect of Pharmaceutical Innovation on the Functional Limitations of Elderly Americans:
Evidence from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey

JEL No. I12,L65,O33
ABSTRACT
I examine the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on the functional status of nursing home residents
using cross-sectional, patient-level data from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey. This was the
first public-use survey of nursing homes that contains detailed information about medication use, and
it contains better data on functional status than previous surveys.
Residents using newer medications and a higher proportion of priority-review medications were more
able to perform all five activities of daily living (ADLs), controlling for age, sex, race, marital status,
veteran status, where the resident lived prior to admission, primary diagnosis at the time of admission,
up to 16 diagnoses at the time of the interview, sources of payment, and facility fixed effects.
The ability of nursing home residents to perform activities of daily living is positively related to the
number of “new” (post-1990) medications they consume, but unrelated to the number of old medications
they consume. If 2004 nursing home residents had used only old medications, the fraction of residents
with all five ADL dependencies would have been 58%, instead of 50%. During the period 1990-2004,
pharmaceutical innovation reduced the functional limitations of nursing home residents by between
1.2% and 2.1% per year.

Introduction

There has been a significant decline over time in the functional limitations of older
people in the United States, and probably worldwide. This finding has been confirmed using
multiple datasets, multiple measures of functional disability, and multiple research
methodologies. For example, Costa (2000) found that functional limitation (difficulty walking,
difficulty bending, paralysis, blindness in at least one eye, or deafness in at least one ear) in the
United States fell at an average annual rate of 0.6% among men aged 50 to 74 from the early
twentieth century to the early 1990s, and Manton, Gu, and Lamb (2006) found a significant rate
of decline in the prevalence of chronic disability in the Medicare-enrolled population aged 65+
that accelerated from 1982 to 2004. The recent decline in disability has occurred despite the
considerable increase in obesity.1
A number of factors may have contributed to the long-run decline in disability. It has
been hypothesized that medical innovation in general, and pharmaceutical innovation in
particular, have made important contributions to the decline in the functional limitations of older
people. Costa (2000) argued that “increased efficacy of medical care” was one of the two main
factors that could account for the long-term decline in functional disability at older ages.2
Experts convened at a 2001 National Institute of Aging-National Bureau of Economic Research
workshop on disability decline noted that “there have been many ‘high tech’ medical advances
that have improved health” (Woodbury (2001)). Three examples they cited were intensive
treatment for heart disease, increased use of anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis treatment, and
“significant advances in both pharmacological and other treatment of mental illness.” The
experts agreed that “more research was recommended to better quantify the relative importance
of [the] various factors” contributing to disability decline.
In this paper, I will examine the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on the functional
status of nursing home residents using cross-sectional, patient-level data from the 2004 National
Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). This was the first public-use survey of nursing homes that
contains detailed information about medication use, and it contains better data on functional
status than previous surveys. In particular, I will investigate whether nursing home residents

The fraction of American adults that are obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30.0) increased from 22.9% in 198894 to 34.3% in 2005-6. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/overweight/overweight_adult.htm#table1

The second factor she cited is the decline in chronic disease rates.

using newer drugs have higher functional status, controlling for multiple diagnoses and many
other characteristics of residents and of the facilities where they reside. About 1.5 million
Americans resided in nursing homes in 2004. Eighty-eight percent were 65 years and older; 45%
were 85 years and older.3
The 2004 NNHS consisted of a two-stage design with a probability sample of 1,500
nursing facilities in the first stage and up to 12 current residents from each facility in the second
stage. This nationally representative sample survey was conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics from August 2004 through
January 2005. For 13,507 recipients, data were obtained on health status, medications taken,
demographic characteristics, services received, and sources of payment. Data for the survey
were obtained through personal interviews with facility administrators and designated staff who
used administrative records to answer questions about the facilities, staff, services and programs,
and medical records to answer questions about the residents.
The basic research design of the study is depicted in Figure 1. The NNHS contains
information about the ability of the resident to perform various activities of daily living (ADLs).
For each activity, the resident’s ability is evaluated on an ordinal scale (from “independent” to
“totally dependent”). We will estimate ordered probit models4 of the ability of an individual to
perform activities of daily living.
The explanatory variables of primary interest are the characteristics of the medications
used by the resident.5 One important attribute is the mean vintage (FDA approval year) of
medications used. We hypothesize that the quality of new drugs tends to be higher than the
quality of old drugs, and therefore that mean vintage is an indicator of the average quality of
drugs consumed. Drugs that received “priority-review” status from the FDA may also be of
higher quality than “standard-review” drugs, conditional on FDA approval year.6 As shown in
Figure 1, we will control for a large set of nursing home resident attributes that are likely to

The probit procedure calculates maximum likelihood estimates of regression parameters and the natural (or
threshold) response rate for quantal response data from biological assays or other discrete event data. Probit analysis
developed from the need to analyze qualitative (dichotomous or polytomous) dependent variables within the
regression framework. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is inadequate when the dependent variable is
discrete. Probit or logit analyses are more appropriate in this case. See Rodríguez (2010) for a discussion of the
ordered probit model.

influence his or her functional status, including detailed information about diagnoses,
demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, marital status, etc.), and sources of payment.
We believe that heterogeneous pharmaceutical treatment of nursing home patients,
controlling for their diagnoses, demographic characteristics, insurance coverage, facility, and
other factors, is primarily due to physician practice variation.7 Wennberg (2004) argues that
“unwarranted [treatment] variation—variation not explained by illness, patient preference, or the
dictates of evidence-based medicine—is a ubiquitous feature of U.S. health care.” A large
number of studies have documented the importance of unexplained variation in medical care in
general and prescribing behavior in particular. Much of this literature focuses on regional
variation in medical treatment,8 but a number of studies have shown that there is substantial
treatment variation within narrowly-defined regions, health care organizations, and even
facilities. Dick et al (2011) analyzed data on 994 women who were diagnosed with Ductal
Carcinoma In Situ from 1985 through 2000 in Monroe County (New York) and the Henry Ford
Health System (Detroit, MI). They found that “margin status and receipt of radiation therapy
vary by surgeon,” and "the extent of variation [by surgeon] and its contribution to long-term
health outcomes are troubling.” Kralewski et al (1999) found that, even within a single
Minneapolis/St. Paul HMO during 1990, there were “wide variations in individual physician
practice styles” in the amount of resources used to manage uncomplicated hypertension.
Ketcham et al (2007) found that “patients treated by solo physicians were less likely to receive
cardiac catheterization and angioplasty within a day of admission and more likely to die than
other patients in the same hospital, even after a number of patient and physician characteristics
were taken into account” (emphasis added). Data published by the New York State Department
7

Data collected by Levy et al (2006) from eight nursing homes indicated that the mean number of physicians who
come to a facility is 15; the mean number of beds in the eight facilities was 212. (The eight facilities were selected
for case studies of physician practice models; no attempt was made to select a representative sample from which to
draw statistical inferences.) The mean number of prescribers in a facility is presumably greater than 15, since in
some cases medications may also be prescribed by nursing home staff (medical directors) and advanced practice
nurses. The mean number of registered nurses in a nursing home is 8
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nnhsd/nursinghomefacilities2006.pdf).
8
Some studies of regional variation have found no correlation across regions between measures of treatment
intensity (e.g. per capita medical expenditure) and health outcomes. But Lichtenberg (2011a, 2011b, 2011c)
provides evidence based on longitudinal state-level data from both the U.S. and Germany that states that adopted
medical innovations (new drugs and/or advanced imaging procedures) more rapidly had larger improvements in
health (higher longevity growth and/or slower disability growth), controlling for other determinants of health.

4

of Health (1998) indicate that the risk-adjusted mortality rates of patients receiving coronary
artery bypass surgery varied considerably across surgeons operating within the same hospital.
Health services researchers have identified a number of factors that explain some of the
variation in individual physician practice styles, including physician gender, practice size,
specialty, and membership in professional organizations.
Physician gender. DeSalvo et al (2000) reported “wide variation…in assignment of
reappointment interval with mean return intervals…ranging from 2.2 to 20.5 weeks. Sex was a
significant provider independent variable…Female providers assigned earlier reappointment
intervals for their patients.” Kuo et al (2011) examined the effect of physician characteristics on
provision of recommended care practices for children with special health care needs among
primary care physicians in Arkansas. They found that female physicians spent more time with
patients and were more likely to provide community referrals.
Practice size. Epstein et al (1983) studied the records of 351 hypertensive patients cared for by
30 internists in group or solo private practice to investigate whether group size influences the
number of tests ordered for ambulatory patients. They found that patients of physicians who
were members of large groups received twice as many tests as patients of physicians in small
groups or in solo practice. These effects were independent of the patient's age and sex, the year
the physician graduated from medical school, and the availability of testing machinery at the
practice site. Kuo et al (2011) found that solo and 2-person practice was associated with
recommended care practices, including written care plan.
Physician specialty. Greenfield et al. (1992) found that cardiologists and endocrinologists had
higher levels of resource utilization (hospitalizations, annual office visits, prescription drugs, and
common tests and procedures) than physicians practicing family medicine and internal medicine,
controlling for patient mix and other factors.
Membership in professional organizations. Chung et al (2011) found that Medicare beneficiaries
who were treated by American Society for Surgery of the Hand member surgeons receive
internal fixation for distal radius fractures (DRFs) at a significantly higher rate than do patients
of other physicians.

5

These factors explain some of the variation in individual physician practice styles, but
most of the variation is unexplained. For example, Kralewski et al (1999) found that “culture
and structural variables explained only 8 percent of the variance in resource use.”

Measurement

Functional status. The survey obtained data on the ability of residents to perform the following
five Activities of Daily Living (ADLs): (1) transferring (to/from: bed, chair, wheelchair,
standing position); (2) dressing; (3) eating; (4) using the toilet; and (5) bathing. For each of these
activities, the survey determined whether (1) the resident could perform the activity
independently; (2) the resident requires supervision; (3) the resident requires limited assistance;
(4) the resident requires extensive assistance; or (5) the resident is totally dependent.9 Table 1
shows the percent distribution of nursing home residents, according to type of assistance required
with each activity of daily living. It also shows the percent distribution of nursing home
residents, by number of ADL dependencies (i.e., the number of activities for which the resident
was not independent). Half of residents had five ADL dependencies (i.e., they could not perform
any of the five ADLs independently); 78% had 4 or more ADL dependencies. Two-thirds of
residents were able to eat independently or with supervision, but only 8% were able to bathe
independently or with supervision.
Medication attributes. The survey also obtained data on all medications used by the resident.
Nursing home residents tend to use many medications; the mean number of medications used is
nine. We identified the active ingredients of all of the medications used by each resident. We
used data provided by the FDA
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm079750.htm) to determine two attributes of
each active ingredient: (1) the year in which the FDA first approved a product containing that
active ingredient (we refer to this year as the “vintage” of the active ingredient); and (2) whether
any products containing that active ingredient were approved on a priority-review (as opposed to
standard-review) basis. The FDA grants Priority Review designation to drugs that are believed
to offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists,
9

Previous surveys (e.g. the 1999 NNHS) only reported whether or not the resident required at least some assistance.

6

and Standard Review designation to drugs believed to offer at most, only minor improvement
over existing marketed therapies.10 Thus, although the vintage (FDA approval year) of a
standard-review drug may be greater than that of an earlier drug, its “effective vintage” may not
be greater.
The NNHS provided data on N_RXia: the total number of medications used by resident i
that contained active ingredient a (a=1,…,800). From the Drugs@FDA database, we constructed
the following variables:
FDA_YEARa = the year in which the FDA first approved a product containing active
ingredient a
POST1980a = 1 if FDA_YEARa > 1980
= 0 otherwise
POST1990a = 1 if FDA_YEARa > 1990
= 0 otherwise
PRIORITYa = 1 if any products containing active ingredient a were approved on a priorityreview (as opposed to standard-review) basis
= 0 otherwise
We combined the NNHS medication data with the FDA ingredient attribute data to construct the
following variables characterizing the distribution of medications used by each nursing home
resident:
VINTAGEi = (a N_RXia FDA_YEARa) / a N_RXia = the (weighted) mean vintage of
medications used by resident i
POST1980%i = (a N_RXia POST1980a) / a N_RXia = the fraction of medications used by
resident i that contained active ingredients approved after 1980
POST1990%i = (a N_RXia POST1990a) / a N_RXia = the fraction of medications used by
resident i that contained active ingredients approved after 1990
PRIORITY%i = (a N_RXia PRIORITYa) / a N_RXia = the fraction of medications used by
resident i that contained active ingredients approved on a priority-review (as
opposed to standard-review) basis
N_RXi = a N_RXia = the total number of medications used by resident i
N_RX_NEWi = a N_RXia POST1990a = the total number of “new” (post-1990) medications
used by resident i
N_RX_OLDi = a N_RXia (1 - POST1990a) = the total number of “old” (pre-1991)
medications used by resident i

We will estimate several models to investigate how the characteristics of medications
used affects the functional status of nursing home residents. The first model will be of the
following form:
HEALTHi =  VINTAGEi +  PRIORITY%i +  N_RXi +  Zi + i

(1)

Six indicators of HEALTH will be used: the number of ADLs which the resident can perform
independently (N_INDEP; N_INDEP = 0, 1,…, 5) and indicators of the extent of assistance
required for each ADL.11 The variable Z in eq. (1) represents a vector of a large number of other
(non-medication-related) characteristics of the resident, whose elements will be described below.
We hypothesize that  > 0: residents who use newer drugs will tend to be in better health, ceteris
paribus. We also hypothesize that  > 0: conditional on mean vintage, the greater the fraction of
drugs that were priority-review drugs, the better the health of the consumer, since standardreview drugs are similar to older drugs. We are agnostic as to the sign of . It would not be
surprising if this coefficient were negative, i.e. if residents who consumed more medications
were in worse health, since greater use of medical care (including prescription drugs) is often a
marker for greater unobserved illness severity.
Eq. (1) is based on the implicit hypothesis that the effect of drug vintage on health status
is linear. This rather strong assumption can be relaxed by estimating the following alternative
model:
HEALTHi = 1 POST1980%i + 2 POST1990%i +  PRIORITY%i +  N_RXi +  Zi + i

(2)

In this model, drugs approved before 1980 serve as the reference group. 1 is an estimate of the
difference between the health effects of post-1980 drugs and pre-1981 drugs; 2 is an estimate of
the difference between the health effects of post-1990 drugs and pre-1991 drugs; and (1 + 2) is
an estimate of the difference between the health effects of post-1990 drugs and pre-1981 drugs.
In both of the preceding equations, the resident’s health is assumed to depend on the
“quality” (vintage) and quantity of medications consumed in an additive fashion. However,
11

These will be coded as follows: 4 = independent; 3 = supervision; 2 = limited assistance; 1 = extensive assistance;
0 = total dependence.

8

health may depend on the interaction between quality and quantity.12 The following model
allows for this interaction:
HEALTHi = 1 N_RX_NEWi + 2 N_RX_OLDi +  PRIORITY%i +  Zi + i

(3)

We hypothesize that 1 > 2: the effect on health of an increase in the number of new
medications is larger than the effect on health of an increase in the number of old medications.13
Demographic variables. We will control for single-year-of-age by sex, race, marital status,
veteran status, and where the resident lived prior to admission.
Diagnosis variables. We will control for the primary diagnosis at the time of admission by
including fixed primary-admission-diagnosis effects at the 2-digit ICD9 level. We also control
for up to 16 diagnoses at the time of the interview by including dummy variables for each 2-digit
ICD9 disease. If a resident had 5 diagnoses (comorbidities) at the time of the interview, five of
these dummy variables would be equal to 1, and the remainder would be zero.
Diseases of the circulatory system were the leading primary diagnoses among nursing
home residents at admission (23.7%) and at the time of interview (25%). Mental disorders were
the second leading primary diagnoses among residents at admission (16.4%), as well as at the
time of interview (21.9%). Fourteen percent of residents had a primary admission diagnosis for
diseases of the nervous system and sense organs, and 16.5% had that primary diagnosis at the
time of interview.
Sources of payment. We will include dummy variables for each of the following sources of
payment: private health insurance; life care; Self/Private pay/out-of-pocket; Medicare (including
Medicare HMO); Medicaid (including Medicaid HMO); Welfare or other government assistance;
Department of Veterans Affairs; and Other payment source.
Facility fixed effects. All models will include 1125 facility fixed effects. Due to the inclusion of
these fixed effects, each nursing home resident is being compared with other residents of the
same facility. Inclusion of these fixed effects will correct for systematic biases in reporting by
facility administrators, e.g. about functional limitations of residents.

12
13

Quality will matter more if the quantity is large.
However, it might be the case that that 0 > 1 > 2.

9

Unfortunately, the NNHS does not provide information about other potential
determinants of functional status, such as the resident’s income, wealth, or educational
attainment. However, these other potential determinants are likely to be controlled for, to an
important extent, by factors included in the model, such as race, diagnoses, and sources of
payment. The facility fixed effects are also likely to control for a substantial amount of variation
in socioeconomic status (SES), since SES is likely to play an important role in the “assignment”
of residents to facilities.
Table 2 shows mean values of the medication attribute variables, by race (black vs. not
black) of resident. These data suggest that there is little or no correlation between medication
attributes and SES. Medication attributes are also uncorrelated with sources of payment.
Descriptive statistics
Table 3 shows descriptive statistics on medication attributes. Table 4 shows the number
of patients in the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey using prescription medicines, by class of
drug.
Table 5 shows the top 40 medications used by 2004 National Nursing Home Survey
respondents, ranked by the number of residents using the medication. The “FDA Approval
Year” is the first year in which a product containing an ingredient was approved, according to
the Drugs@FDA database. Some drugs are certainly older than this calculation implies. For
example, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the first known use of the term “aspirin”
was in 1899.14 The Drugs@FDA database does not provide reliable estimates of the vintage of
very old drugs (those that existed before the FDA was established in 1938). It is likely that the
variables POST1980% and POST1990% are measured more reliably than the VINTAGE
variable.
Twenty-nine percent of 2004 nursing home residents were male, 8% were veterans, and
10% were black. Sources of payment are shown in Table 6.15

14

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aspirin
There can be multiple payment sources. Medicare's coverage of nursing home care is quite limited. Medicare
covers up to 100 days of "skilled nursing care" per illness, but there are a number of requirements that must be met
before the nursing home stay will be covered. http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Medicare/2008/8-01-18SenCitNeed2Know.htm A life-care fee or “founder's fee” is paid either monthly or as a lump sum under an
agreement with a retirement home. http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ar02.html#en_US_publink1000178969

Empirical results

Estimates of selected coefficients from the first model of the functional status of nursing
home residents (eq. (1)) are shown in Table 7. As noted earlier, all models include dummy
variables for single-year-of-age by sex, race, marital status, veteran status, where the resident
lived prior to admission, primary diagnosis at the time of admission, up to 16 diagnoses at the
time of the interview, sources of payment, and facility fixed effects.
The dependent variable of the first model (model 1a) in Table 7 is the number of ADLs
the resident could perform independently. As we hypothesized, the coefficients on VINTAGE
and PRIORITY% are both positive and highly significant. Residents using newer medications,
and medications approved on a priority-review basis, were able to perform more activities of
daily living independently, ceteris paribus. Recall that the FDA considers standard-review drugs
(those not granted priority review) to be therapeutically similar to previously-approved drugs.
The fact that the ratio of the PRIORITY% coefficient to the VINTAGE coefficient is 22.6
suggests that standard-review drugs are similar to drugs approved 22.6 years earlier, on average.
The coefficient on the number of medications consumed (N_RX) is also positive and
highly significant: residents consuming more medications were able to perform more activities of
daily living independently. This is somewhat surprising since, as noted earlier, greater use of
medical care (including prescription drugs) is often a marker for greater unobserved illness
severity.
In the remaining five models (models 1b-1f) of Table 7, the dependent variables are
indexes of the ability of residents to perform each of the five activities of daily living
(transferring, dressing, etc.). In all five models, all three of the medication coefficients are
positive and highly significant. Residents using newer medications, a higher proportion of
priority-review medications, and more medications were more able to perform all five activities
of daily living.
The estimates in Table 7 are from models that include facility fixed effects. We also
estimated models that included a set of observable facility characteristics (dummy variables for

11

nursing home ownership type, bedsize, and metropolitan area status16) instead of facility fixed
effects, and models that included neither facility characteristics nor facility fixed effects.
Estimates of the VINTAGE and PRIORITY% coefficients from these models and models with
facility fixed effects are shown in Table 8. In models 1-3 of Table 8, the dependent variable is
the number of ADLs the resident could perform independently. Model 1 includes neither facility
characteristics nor facility fixed effects (but all of the other covariates enumerated above).
Model 2 includes facility characteristics, and model 3 includes facility fixed effects. Both the
VINTAGE and the PRIORITY% coefficients are positive and highly significant in all three
models. The estimates of models 1 and 2 are quite similar: controlling for facility characteristics
has almost no effect on these coefficients. But controlling for facility fixed effects significantly
increases the magnitude of both coefficients: the VINTAGE coefficient is 55% larger in model 3
than it is in model 1, and the PRIORITY% coefficient is 34% larger. Models 4-18 of Table 8
show that we obtain similar results when we analyze the other dependent variables: the
VINTAGE and PRIORITY% coefficients are positive and highly significant when we don’t
control for facility fixed effects (whether or not we control for facility characteristics), but are
larger when we control for facility fixed effects. Since the facility fixed effects are likely to
control for important determinants of measured functional status (e.g. the socioeconomic status
of residents, unmeasured quality of healthcare providers, and biases in facility survey responses),
we believe that models including facility fixed effects are the most reliable, and these fixed
effects will be included in the models discussed in the remainder of this article.
Table 9 presents estimates of eq. (2), in which the VINTAGE variable is replaced by
POST1980% and POST1990%. In all six models, the coefficients on all four medication
variables are positive and significant. These estimates indicate that post-1980 medications
reduce functional limitations more than pre-1981 medications, and that post-1990 medications
reduce functional limitations more than pre-1991 medications. Moreover, the difference
between the effects of post-1990 medications and medications approved in the 1980s is larger
than the difference between medications approved in the 1980s and medications approved before
1981.
16

There are two ownership status categories (for-profit vs. all others (private and gov't not-for-profit)), four bedsize
categories (3-49 beds, 50-99 beds, 100-199 beds, and 200+ beds), and three metropolitan area status categories
(metropolitan, micropolitan, and neither).

12

Table 10 presents estimates of eq. (3), in which there are three medication variables: the
number of “new” (post-1990) medications (N_RX_NEW), the number of “old” (pre-1991)
medications (N_RX_OLD), and the fraction of (all) medications that were granted priorityreview (PRIORITY%). In all six models, the coefficient on N_RX_NEW is positive and highly
significant. The coefficient on N_RX_OLD is insignificant in four of the six models. It is
positive and significant in only one model (model 3d, ability to eat), and in this case, it is only
1/7 as large as the coefficient on N_RX_NEW. This signifies that, in general, the ability of
nursing home residents to perform activities of daily living is positively related to the number of
new medications they consume, but unrelated to the number of old medications they consume.
The positive coefficients on the total number of medications (N_RX) in eqs. (1) and (2) (Tables
3 and 4) was solely attributable to new medications.
All of the estimates reported so far have attempted to assess the impact of pharmaceutical
innovation in general on the functional limitations of nursing home residents. Assessing the
impact of specific types of pharmaceutical innovation (i.e., innovation in specific classes of
drugs) is also worthwhile. If we had a much larger sample of patients, we could accomplish this
by including characteristics (e.g. vintage) of multiple classes of drugs in a single model. But
most patients take drugs in only a few classes, so including characteristics of multiple classes of
drugs in a single model would severely limit our sample size. Therefore, we have estimated
versions of eq. (3) separately for the five most highly utilized drug classes shown in Table 4.
These estimates are shown in Table 11.17 We report estimates of six models in this table.
In all of these models, the dependent variable is the number of ADLs the resident could perform
independently, and the explanatory variables are: the patient’s number of post-1980 medications
within the drug class, the patient’s number of pre-1981 medications within the drug class, and
the fraction of the patient’s medications within the drug class that were granted priority review.
Model 1 in Table 11 shows estimates based on data on all medications. These estimates are
consistent with the estimates presented in Table 10 (which defined new drugs as post-1990
drugs). Models 2-6 in Table 11 show estimates based on each of the five drug classes. In 3 out
of 5 classes (metabolic/nutrients, cardiovascular-renal drugs, and central nervous system drugs),
17

The number of observations for each drug class shown in Table 11 is lower than the number of patients using each
drug class shown in Table 4 because the FDA approval years of some drugs could not be determined.

13

the coefficient on the number of post-1980 medications is positive and highly significant, and the
coefficient on the number of pre-1981 medications is not significant at the 5% level. In a fourth
class (gastrointestinal agents), the coefficient on the number of post-1980 medications is
insignificant, and the coefficient on the number of pre-1981 medications is negative and
significant; the difference between the two coefficients is positive and presumably significant18
(as it is in models 2, 3, and 5). In the fifth class (relief of pain drugs), the coefficient on the
number of post-1980 medications is again larger than the coefficient on the number of pre-1981
medications, but the difference appears to be insignificant. These results indicate that the
estimates presented in Tables 7-10 do not merely reflect the impact of innovation in a small
minority of drug classes.
Now I will use the estimates in Table 10 to estimate how much higher the functional
limitations of 2004 nursing home residents would have been if only pre-1991 medications had
been used. As noted earlier, in 2004 the mean values of N_RX_NEW and N_RX_OLD were
3.63 and 5.51, respectively, and the mean value of N_RX was 9.14 (= 3.63 + 5.51). Suppose that
2004 nursing home residents had consumed the same number of medications, but that none of
those medications were post-1990 medications: N_RX_NEW = 0 and N_RX_OLD = 9.14.
Fourteen years earlier (in 1990), none of the medications could have been post-1990
medications. The coefficients on N_RX_NEW and N_RX_OLD in Table 10 allow us to
estimate how much higher the functional limitations of 2004 nursing home residents would have
been had they used zero new medications and 9.14 old medications instead of 3.63 new
medications and 5.51 old medications. The predicted probability of being totally dependent is
prob_depend_pred = F[F-1(prob_depend_actual) + 3.63 (1 – 2)]
where prob_depend_actual = the actual probability of being totally dependent (shown in Table
1); 1 = the coefficient on N_RX_NEW in eq. (3); 2 = the coefficient on N_RX_OLD in eq.
(3); F( ) is the standard normal cumulative distribution; and F-1( ) is the inverse of the standard
normal cumulative distribution.
The results of these calculations are shown in Figure 2. The estimates imply that the
functional limitations of 2004 nursing home residents would have been considerably greater if
only pre-1991 medications had been used. For example, we estimate that 33% of residents

The software we use (the SAS Probit procedure) does not allow us to perform tests of the significance of
differences between parameter estimates.

would have been totally dependent to get dressed, instead of 25% of residents.19 Since only pre1991 medications were used in 1990, (1/14) * ln(prob_depend_actual/prob_depend_pred) is an
estimate of the average annual rate of decline of functional limitation due to pharmaceutical
innovation during the period 1990-2004. These estimates, by ADL, are shown in Table 12.
During the period 1990-2004, pharmaceutical innovation is estimated to have reduced the
functional limitations of nursing home residents by between 1.2% and 2.1% per year.
Summary and conclusions
There has been a significant decline over time in the functional limitations of older
people in the United States, and probably worldwide. Previous investigators have hypothesized
that medical innovation in general, and pharmaceutical innovation in particular, has made
important contributions to the decline in the functional limitations of older people. In this paper,
I have examined the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on the functional status of nursing home
residents using cross-sectional, patient-level data from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey.
This was the first public-use survey of nursing homes that contains detailed information about
medication use, and it contains better data on functional status than previous surveys.
I found that residents using newer medications and a higher proportion of priority-review
medications were more able to perform all five activities of daily living, controlling for age, sex,
race, marital status, veteran status, where the resident lived prior to admission, primary diagnosis
at the time of admission, up to 16 diagnoses at the time of the interview, sources of payment, and
facility fixed effects.
The ability of nursing home residents to perform activities of daily living is positively
related to the number of “new” (post-1990) medications they consume, but unrelated to the
number of old medications they consume. We estimated how much higher the functional
limitations of 2004 nursing home residents would have been had they used old medications
instead of new medications. We estimate that the fraction of nursing home residents with all five
ADL dependencies (number of activities for which the resident is not independent) would have
been 58%, instead of 50%. During the period 1990-2004, pharmaceutical innovation is

19

We also estimate that the fraction of nursing home residents with all five ADL dependencies (number of activities
for which the resident is not independent) would have been 58%, instead of 50%.

15

estimated to have reduced the functional limitations of nursing home residents by between 1.2%
and 2.1% per year.
Unfortunately, the NNHS does not provide information about some potential
determinants of functional status, such as the resident’s income, wealth, or educational
attainment. However, these other potential determinants are likely to be controlled for, to an
important extent, by factors included in the model, such as race, diagnoses, and sources of
payment. The facility fixed effects are also likely to control for a substantial amount of variation
in socioeconomic status (SES), since SES is likely to play an important role in the “assignment”
of residents to facilities. Also, analysis of data by race suggested that there is little or no
correlation between medication attributes and SES.
