Sequential Bargaining in the Field: Evidence from Millions of Online Bargaining Interactions

NBER Working Paper No. 24306
February 2018
JEL No. C7,D0,L0
ABSTRACT
We study patterns of behavior in bilateral bargaining situations using a rich, new dataset
describing over 88 million listings from eBay's Best Offer platform, with back-and-forth
bargaining occurring in over 25 million of these listings. We document patterns of behavior and
relate them to "rational" and "psychological" theories of bargaining and find that bargaining
patterns are consistent with elements of both approaches. Most notably, players with more
bargaining strength typically receive better outcomes, and players exhibit equitable behavior by
making offers that split-the-difference between negotiating positions. We are publicly releasing
this new dataset to support additional empirical bargaining research.

Introduction

Bilateral bargaining is one of the oldest and most common forms of trade. Nations
negotiate trade deals, arms control, and climate change mitigation; legislators engage
in horse-trading to build coalitions and pass legislation; business people haggle over
contracts from corporate acquisitions to labor agreements; lawyers wrangle settlements
both civil and criminal, and private individuals bargain over wages, real estate, and the
allocation of household chores. Bargaining determines the allocation of surplus in these
settings, as well as the likelihood of breakdown—the latter with real economic and
human costs. Therefore, understanding how people bargain, and the institutions, norms,
and practices that affect bargaining outcomes, is a question of first-order importance.
Over the past sixty years, a large literature in economics has examined various
aspects of bargaining in theory and in laboratory experiments, but little evidence has
been presented about how people bargain in the field, and how negotiated prices
actually form in real-world negotiations. The theoretical literature typically assumes
a particular information structure and extensive form of the game, while bargaining
in real-world settings tends to be less structured. The advent of online marketplaces
provides a new opportunity to study negotiations in a setting where the extensive form
of the game is similar to those studied in the theoretical and experimental literature, but
with the advantage of being a setting where real-live participants are negotiating and
where the data collection is on a massive scale. In this paper, we utilize data on over
88 million listings on the eBay.com “Best Offer” platform, where sellers offer items at
a listed price and invite buyers to engage in alternating, sequential-offer bargaining,
very much in the spirit of Rubinstein (1982). In over 25 million of these listings, buyers
chose to make an offer, initiating the alternating-offer game. Within this setting, we
document a variety of facts on how bargaining proceeds and how prices form and the
forces that play a role in this process. We find evidence consistent with the most salient
predictions of economic theory and also document evidence suggesting that behavioral
factors based on equitable norms play a significant role in bargaining outcomes.
Our data come from eBay’s Best Offer platform. While more widely known for its
sales of goods through auctions or a fixed price, eBay has also offered sales through
alternating-offer bargaining for over a decade, and now almost ten percent of eBay
transaction volume occurs through bargaining. The mechanism allows each player in a
1

given buyer-seller pair to make up to three offers each. Given the sheer volume of trade
on eBay and the simple extensive form of the game, the Best Offer platform provides
a useful setting for studying the determination of agreed-upon prices in sequential
bargaining situations.1 The bargaining in this setting is only over a single dimension
(price), making it more straightforward to analyze than many other bargaining settings
(such as procurement contracts; Bajari et al. 2009), while still yielding the benefit of
being a real-world setting. Furthermore, the data allows us to link buyers and sellers
over time.
This dataset is, to our knowledge, the largest offer-level negotiations dataset to be
analyzed in the literature. In cooperation with eBay, we have anonymized the dataset
and have been given clearance to make it publicly available for research purposes. The
data can be accessed at http://www.nber.org/data/bargaining.html or by contacting
the authors. We hope that it will further fuel the recent surge of empirical work studying
bargaining in economics and stimulate additional work in the area, both empirical and
theoretical.
After summarizing recent work in the growing empirical bargaining literature in
Section 2, Section 3 describes background on the Best Offer platform and introduces our
dataset. Section 4 then documents how patterns observed in the data relate to rational
game-theoretic theories of bargaining. We provide a breakdown of how bargaining
sequences unfold in practice and the frequency with which different responses and
outcomes occur. We find that there are typically few back-and-forth offers between a
given bargaining pair, which is consistent with complete-information, common-priors
models of bargaining, such as the classical Rubinstein (1982) model. However, the fact
that some delay in agreement is observed is consistent with models of heterogeneous
priors (Yildiz 2003) or incomplete information (Rubinstein 1985; Admati and Perry
1987; Cramton 1992). And the observation that bargaining very frequently ends in
disagreement is consistent with the presence of incomplete information and bargaining
1 Fudenberg

et al. (1985) explained that the “thorny issue” arising in much of the bargaining literature
is that the researcher does not actually know the extensive form of real-world bargaining scenarios. For
example, a street vendor bargaining over price might state an offer, watch the facial reaction of the buyer,
and immediately state a lower price without waiting for a spoken response by the buyer. It is unclear
whether this situation should be modeled with alternating offers, one-sided offers, a concession game, or
any number of possible options. In the situation we study, the extensive form is much clearer: buyers and
sellers participate in an alternating-offer bargaining game through eBay’s platform, and never interact
with one another except through this platform.

costs. We show that the character of bargaining is different when players bargain over
expensive versus inexpensive products, in a way that is consistent with fixed costs of
bargaining playing a role.
We also find that final prices form very quickly, although not instantaneously, and
these final prices tend to be well within the interior of initial offers. We find that prices
tend to converge in a pattern consistent with Coasian dynamics, with seller offers
declining and buyer offers increasing over the duration of the bargaining interaction.
We demonstrate that bargaining sequences that end through the seller declining after
several back-and-forth offers are likely to be interactions in which the seller budged
little even from the initial listing price, while we do not find this result for buyers.
We also demonstrate that, for used goods, variation in the features of the bargaining
sequence—namely, whether the bargaining is successful, the number of offers made in
the bargaining sequence, and the final price—can be explained more by heterogeneity
in the participating buyer than by heterogeneity in the seller or in the product itself.
With new goods, on the other hand, variance in the final negotiated prices is explained
equally well by player heterogeneity and by product heterogeneity.
We examine several forms of bargaining strength. We find that buyers who are
more patient (as measured by their ex-post choice of shipping speed) tend to obtain
lower prices in the bargaining. Buyers who are more experienced in bargaining on this
platform (as measured by the number of previous Best Offer negotiations the buyer has
participated in) also tend to achieve lower final prices, and experienced sellers achieve
higher final prices. These results are consistent with common models of bargaining
in which patience or other measures of a player’s bargaining power affect outcomes
(Rubinstein 1982, 1985; Watson 1998); they are also consistent with laboratory evidence
(Rapoport et al. 1995) and survey data (Scott Morton et al. 2011), but, to our knowledge,
have not been previously confirmed with data from actual bargaining outcomes.
In Section 5 we explore players’ choices of counteroffers. We find that participants
in the market appear to concede more to the opposing party when the opposing party
is more experienced and concede less when they themselves are more experienced.
We also analyze aspects of non-standard, or “behavioral” bargaining models by examining the phenomenon documented throughout the experimental and theoretical
behavioral literature that market participants care about fairness, and often favor a

3

split-the-difference strategy in bargaining (Roth and Malouf 1979; Roth 1985; Binmore
et al. 1985; Bolton 1991; Bolton and Ockenfels 2000; Charness and Rabin 2002; Andreoni and Bernheim 2009). We demonstrate that a player often makes offers lying
halfway between the player’s own previous offer and the opponent’s current offer. We
further demonstrate that such split-the-difference offers have a higher likelihood of
being accepted—higher even than some offers that would be even more favorable in
money terms for the accepting party. This is consistent with preferences for fairness as
symmetry, notably with endogenous reference points.
While similar results have been documented among laboratory participants, these
are the first results of which we are aware documenting such findings in a real-world
setting. The large scale of our data and the variation across several measures of heterogeneity help paint a useful picture of sequential bargaining in the real world, and
confirm some of the most basic insights of bargaining theory.

Recent Empirical Work on Bargaining

Until recently, there was limited empirical work corresponding to the sprawling theoretical literature on bargaining in economics. That work was mostly confined to the study
of labor negotiations and strikes (see, e.g., Cramton and Tracy 2003). The past five years,
however, have seen a burst of empirical studies of bargaining due to two concurrent
events: first, the development of tractable empirical models of bargaining for the study
of price-setting, and second, the increasing availability of data on bargaining outcomes.
Here we offer a map of current empirical work on bargaining based on the underlying
theory.
A commonly applied model of bargaining for empirical work is the cooperative
game theory concept of Nash bargaining, where players choose a price that maximizes
the joint product of their surplus, weighted by the player’s bargaining power weights.2
These models are tractable and offer unique solutions, making them extremely useful
for empirical work. This is particularly true in settings where the only observable
information from a bargaining process is the final price and only for instances when the
2 Nash

(1950) introduced a parsimonious set of axioms that resulted in a solution with these properties.

4

negotiating parties reach agreement. Early structural work on bargaining made these
assumptions to make otherwise unwieldy settings tractable, e.g. Elyakime et al. (1997).
Horn and Wolinsky (1988) extended the Nash bargaining solution to model vertical
firm-to-firm pricing. Their model softened the take-it-or-leave it assumption of traditional models of vertical relations, but required a restrictive assumption on disagreement
payoffs: that players do not incorporate the outside option of bargaining with other
parties. This assumption has become known as “Nash-in-Nash,” and noncooperative
underpinnings for this model are explored in Collard-Wexler et al. (2014). The usefulnesses of the Horn and Wolinsky (1988) model was first exploited in Crawford and
Yurukoglu (2012), who studied the cable industry and demonstrated the importance of
accounting for bargaining in vertical relationships firms when evaluating downstream
retail bundling. Subsequently, the method has been applied to study insurance networks
(Ho and Lee, 2017), bargaining over medical devices (Grennan, 2013), hospital mergers
(Gowrisankaran et al., 2015), and vertical mergers in cable programming (Crawford
et al., 2015), to cite a few leading examples in this growing literature.
Nash bargaining and Nash-in-Nash bargaining, while yielding tractability, neither
explain nor accommodate bargaining breakdown, and the latter framework requires
restrictions on the formulation of disagreement payoffs. This second limitation has
sparked interests in a number of extensions, currently underway, that seek to add an
element of strategic exclusion following the “outside option principle” of Binmore et al.
(1989) (see, for example, Ghili (2016) and Ho and Lee (2016)).
Merlo and Tang (2012) also focus on complete-information settings, but study
stochastic bargaining games in which the size of the surplus may be unknown to
the players. The authors discuss identification and estimation strategies in these settings
and develop an identification strategy for stochastic bargaining games. In later work,
Merlo and Tang (2016) propose and estimate a complete-information model with heterogeneous priors, applying their framework to medical malpractice suits. As emphasized
in the theory literature, models of heterogeneous priors can offer explanations of delay
or breakdown that cannot be explained by traditional Nash bargaining.
Unlike the tractability of the Nash bargaining framework, non-cooperative game
theory models of bargaining, which depend on explicit procedures and incorporate
incomplete information, are often plagued by multiple equilibria and unclear predic-

5

tions. Due to these complications, very little empirical work exists viewing bargaining
through a lens of incomplete information. Such work includes several papers applying structural approaches, including Ambrus et al. (2016), who estimated a one-sided
incomplete-information model that highlighted a signaling role for delay by exploiting
exogenous variation in the time to counteroffers in ransom negotiations with Mediterranean pirates. Silveira (2017) studied identification of asymmetric information models
of bargaining to study sentencing guidelines in pre-trial negotiations. Keniston (2011)
nested sequential-offer bargaining in an empirical dynamic game framework, using
field experimental data from India to study the welfare implications of transacting
through bargaining versus through posted prices. Allen et al. (2014) presented a search
model with bargaining to study the welfare loss due to negotiation frictions in oligopoly
markets. Larsen (2014) and Larsen and Zhang (2017) estimated primitives of two-sided
incomplete-information sequential-offer bargaining games while remaining agnostic
about the bargaining protocol and used these primitives to study bargaining efficiency
and equity in wholesale used-car markets.
Several recent papers have also documented insights from reduced-form analyses
in several bargaining settings. Scott Morton et al. (2011) documented the significance
of search costs and incomplete information in the market for new cars. Grennan and
Swanson (2016) studied the effect of price transparency on bargaining marketplaces,
testing predictions of a model of incomplete information. Shelegia and Sherman (2014)
and Jindal and Newberry (2017) study the costs of bargaining using data on retail
negotiations. Finally, Bagwell et al. (2017) documented a number of data patterns from
negotiated trade agreements, where they observe back-and-forth offers.
Finally, a promising and yet still largely untapped area for empirical work is the
analysis of models that append a “pre-game” to the bargaining protocol. A large set
of theoretical models study these games, which can be used to formalize notions of
pre-commitment a lá Schelling (Crawford, 1982), or to capture a role for communication.
The role of communication in bargaining is particularly difficult to assess because it
is “cheap talk,” however there is theoretical and empirical evidence to suggest it may
be important (Farrell and Gibbons, 1989; Radner and Schotter, 1989; Crawford, 1990;
Cabral and Sákovics, 1995; Valley et al., 2002). Two recent papers addressing these issues
are Backus et al. (2016), which documents the use of round numbers as a cheap-talk
signal in bargaining, and Backus et al. (2018), which exploits a natural experiment in

eBay’s Best Offer Mechanism: Facts and Data

eBay is one of the world’s largest online marketplace for consumer-to-consumer transactions. It began in 1995 using second-price-like auctions as the sole format for transacting
on its platform. The site eventually allowed users the option of selling goods through
a single posted fixed-price. In 2005, the site began to allow sellers to sell through an
alternating-offer protocol referred to as “Best Offer.” This feature can be enabled (at
no cost) by the seller at the creation of the listing, and is only available for fixed-price
listings—there is no equivalent mechanism for auctions.

7

Goods offered for sale under the Best Offer format are listed as “accepts Best Offer”
in eBay search results.3 Throughout, we refer to these postings as Best Offer listings. A
buyer viewing a Best Offer listing sees similar information to a buyer viewing a fixed
price listing (referred to as a “Buy It Now” (BIN) listing), including the auction title,
seller id and feedback score, at least one picture of the item, and any other information
about the item that the seller decides to display.4 The buyer sees the BIN price, as in a
standard fixed price listing, but also sees an additional option, a button labeled “Make
Offer”, as illustrated in Figure 1. Selecting the Make Offer button allows the buyer to
send an offer to the seller. As such, we treat the BIN price (equivalently, “listing price”)
as the seller’s first offer to any buyer who wished to bargain.
Upon receiving this offer, the seller may accept the offer, make a counteroffer, or
decline the offer (without making a counteroffer in return).5 If the seller makes a
counteroffer, the buyer then can accept, decline, or counter in response. Play continues
until either party accepts or until the buyer declines. If the seller declines, the buyer may
still respond with a counteroffer or can, at any time, purchase at the BIN price. Each
party is limited to three offers (not including the listing price), and each offer expires 48
hours after being placed.6 We will refer to a sequence of back-and-forth offers —i.e. a
given buyer and seller pair bargaining over a given item — as a thread.
The Best Offer platform is currently a fast-growing sales format on eBay. Figure 2
shows the growth of this format relative to auctions and fixed price listings over the
past ten years. In 2005, when the format was first rolled out, only a tiny fraction of
listings were Best Offer listings, less than 1% of all eBay transactions occurred through
a buyer actually placing an offer (rather than accepting the Buy It Now price). By 2012,
that fraction had grown to just under 9%.
Figure 3 displays the percent of transactions that took place through Best Offer
for each major sales category from 2005–2015. The left panel demonstrates that the

we will use the term “buyer” to refer to the user interested in potentially buying the
item whether or not the transaction actually occurs.
5 As a time-saving device for sellers, the platform offers sellers the option to specify an “auto-accept”
price which is unobserved to buyers and which, if exceeded by the buyer’s offer, will result in the platform
accepting the offer on behalf of the seller. Seller’s can similarly specify an “auto-decline” price.
6 In 2017 this maximum limit was changed to five offers. In our sample, approximately 1.1 percent of
interactions reach the binding limit, and most of these fail; see Figure 4 below. The limit was extended in
an attempt to encourage these negotiators to succeed. The time frame of our data does not permit us to
evaluate this policy change.

Notes: This figure depicts the percentage of Gross Market Value made up by three mechanisms on the eBay platform—Best Offer,
auctions, and fixed price listings—from 2005 to 2015, computed from internal eBay data. The tabulation for fixed price listings

proportion of listings that enable the Best Offer feature is higher in categories with
more idiosyncratic or one-of-a-kind inventory, such as vehicles, business and industrial equipment, and collectibles. Categories with more well-defined, frequently sold
products, such as media products or electronics, have a smaller fraction of listings
with the Best Offer feature enabled. The right panel displays, for each category, the
ratio of the average BIN price for Best-Offer-enabled listing to the average BIN price
for non-Best-Offer-enabled listings. In nearly every category, the ratio is far greater
than one, suggesting that Best-Offer-enabled listings have a much higher list price than
non-Best-Offer-enabled listings. Furthermore, some categories, such as business and
industrial or collectibles, appear both to have a high fraction of bargaining-enabled
listings and a particularly high list price for those cases where Best Offer is enabled.
To form our primary dataset, we obtain internal eBay data from all Best-Offerenabled, single-unit listings created in May 31, 2012 – June 1, 2013 from the US eBay site.
This consists of over 90 million Best-Offer-enabled listings. This dataset, anonymized
to remove all identifiable information, consistutes the dataset we have arranged to
have released publicly for research purposes. For the analysis in this paper, we also
restrict attention to listings with BIN prices between $.99 and $1,000.00, and eliminate

listings with apparent data errors (e.g., cases where we could not locate the original offer
corresponding to a counteroffer). Details on our sample construction criteria appear in
Appendix B.
Our final dataset analyzed in this paper contains approximately 88.4 million listings.
Of these, 25.4 million received a bargaining offer. Thus, there are 25.4 million bargaining
threads (defined as a listing-buyer pair). These bargaining threads involve 1.2 million
buyers and 4.7 million sellers. The top panel of Table 1 presents descriptive statistics
for this sample. The average list price (BIN) is $95, and the average sale price is 83% of
the list price. Sales include BIN choices as well—conditional on bargaining occurring,
the average sale prices comes down to 73% of the list price. We note that almost 80%
of listings never receive an offer and do not sell. 54.8% of listings are for used goods,
and 26.3% of listings have the BIN price revised at some point by the seller during the
listing life.
Table 1 also includes detailed information on market participants. On average,
sellers have a 99.4% positive feedback score. While there are many one-time sellers,
the market is skewed towards experienced sellers: the average number of listings per
seller is 74, sixteen of which sell, ten of which sell through bargaining. Most of the sales
in our dataset are made by a relatively small fraction of the sellers. The population
of buyers is skewed, but less so: on average, buyers in our sample are observed in 5

bargaining threads, make 8 offers, and purchase 3 items (2.5 of these coming through
bargaining). Finally, at the thread level, Table 1 shows that most bargaining threads are
short (only 1.6 offers, on average, where the first offer is always made by the buyer), and

surprisingly likely to be successful. On average, buyers offer $86.60, which represents
61% of the list price. Bargaining is ultimately successful 45% of the time.

Observed Behavior and Standard Bargaining Theories

In this section, we analyze a number of features of the data to which standard game
theoretic models of bargaining would speak. First, note that Table 1 showed that
there are typically very few back-and-forth offers between a given bargaining pair (1.6
offers on average). This is consistent with many complete-information, common-priors
models of bargaining, in which each party knows the other’s willingness to pay and
all other features of the game, and both parties agree on the likelihood of each party
winning a certain split of the surplus, and thus there is no reason for bargaining to last
more than one round. For example, in the canonical model of Rubinstein (1982), the
unique subgame perfect equilibrium is for the initial offer to be such that the player
responding to this offer immediately accepts. However, the fact that some delay does
occur in this data would not be explained by such a model. Alternative models, such
as models with heterogeneous priors (e.g. Yildiz 2003) can yield delay in some cases.
Delay can also be a result of incomplete information, as demonstrated by Admati and
Perry (1987), Cramton (1992), and others.
Table 1 also shows that bargaining does not always end in agreement. More than
half of threads end without any trade taking place. This is consistent with the presence
of incomplete information. Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) demonstrated that, in the
presence of two-sided incomplete information, where there is uncertainty about whether
gains from trade exist, any bilateral trade mechanism will yield some inefficiency—i.e.
some cases where the buyer indeed values the good more than the seller but the parties
fail to agree on a price. The descriptive statistics in Table 1 are also consistent with the
presence of bargaining costs: without some cost of bargaining, players could continue
bargaining even when there is no surplus to be exploited.
The structure of eBay’s Best Offer bargaining is almost identical to a three-stage
Rubinstein sequential-bargaining game. We illustrate the back-and-forth patterns in the
bargaining data that correspond to the game in Figure 4 in a familiar game tree form.
Square boxes represent the identity of the player (B = buyer, S = seller). At the right
12

of each box, we display the number of observations that reach the node. Below each
node are edges representing the player’s decision to make an initial offer (O), accept
(A), decline (D), or counter (C). Each edge shows the percent of observations passing
through that edge corresponding to a given action being chosen. We will denote periods
of the game with t = 0, 1, ..., 7, where the t = 0 represents the seller’s choice of the BIN
price, t = 1 represents the period of the buyer’s first offer, t = 2 represents the period of
the seller’s first response, etc.7
As Figure 4 demonstrates, sellers frequently decline the initial offer (40% of the time),
to which buyers respond by countering 37% of the time. Sellers accept the initial offer
33% of the time and provide a counteroffer 27% of the time. In cases in which the seller
did not decline either of the first two offers (i.e. the left-most column of the tree), sellers
who receive the opportunity to make a second or third counteroffer at t = 4 or t = 6 are
likely to do so, making offers with greater than 45% probability. Buyers, on the other
hand, appear less likely to make later counteroffers. A primary goal of our descriptive
analysis will be to study these and other patterns in this back-and-forth data in detail
and explore how the bargaining environment (such as characteristics of the good or
characteristics of the participants) impacts these patterns.

4.1

Bargaining Costs

Given the variety of product categories on eBay, one might expect to see substantial
heterogeneity in the expected outcomes. One way to frame this heterogeneity is in
terms of the listing price. Figures 5 and 6 present smoothed plots of expected outcomes
against the listing price for our sample. To construct these plots, we employed a
stratified subsampling approach discussed in Appendix C. The distribution of listing
prices is presented in Panel A of Figure 5, where we see that the vast majority of listings
fall in the $.99 to $100 range. While average first offers are decreasing throughout the
range (Panel B), bargained prices are initially rising and then fall (Panel C), and the
slope of the expected sale prices flips from negative to positive and back again (Panel
D). Figure 6 provides some insight into this pattern. For very cheap items, more buyers

the sake of visual clarity, Figure 4 does not display the buyer’s option to buy at the BIN price
later in the bargaining sequence, which is always an option buyers have available.

exercise the BIN option and forego bargaining (Panels B and C). Moreover, sellers who
do receive offers on cheaper items tend to accept them immediately (Panel D).
We interpret the consumer’s BIN vs. BO choice as informative about the costs of
bargaining. Rubinstein (1982) proposed two models of bargaining costs: one in which
the surplus at stake is discounted exponentially, as if the primary cost of bargaining
were delayed consumption, and a second, in which there is a fixed cost of making offers.
In the first case bargaining costs scale up with the value of the transaction, while in the
latter they are fixed. Assuming higher listing prices correspond to settings with a larger
surplus on the table, our data is consistent with the second hypothesis—that when

15

the listing price is greater and the amount of surplus to be negotiated is large, parties
are more willing to engage in the back and forth of negotiation; and when the listing
price is low and there is little surplus on the table, bargaining power tends to sit with
whomever is making the current offer. This model of costs is also consistent with casual
empiricism: bargaining in street markets is less frequent in developed economies with
higher incomes—it is in some sense an inferior good—but bargaining remains prevalent
among high-value transactions, e.g. salary negotiations, plea bargaining, terms of a
merger, and trade deals; or even big-ticket consumer transactions, such as cars, large
appliances, or homes.
These findings are especially important insofar as most testing of theoretical models
of bargaining has been primarily done in the lab. Experimental work focuses, for reasons
of feasibility, on low-stakes bargaining. If players behave differently when the stakes
are high, because there are fixed costs of bargaining, then this implies an important
caveat to the external validity of those findings. It also highlights the importance of
complementing this experimental testing in the lab with evidence from the field.

4.2

Heterogeneity: Players or Products?

We now turn to the question of whether variance in bargaining outcomes is more a
feature of who is bargaining or of what is being bargained over. The outcomes we
examine are whether or not the bargaining pair comes to an agreement, how many
periods the bargaining takes, and what price the players agree on when they do agree.
The bargaining literature provides a number of possible explanations for why player
heterogeneity may matter in explaining these outcomes: players may differ in their
levels of patience, experience, or other measures of bargaining power/ability, or may
differ in their valuations for the good. We also see the literature as establishing a role for
heterogeneity in the items being bargained over, as markets for different items may be
characterized by varying degrees of asymmetric information, for example. We explore
these issues by regressing outcomes on buyer fixed effects, seller fixed effects, and
product fixed effects in three separate regressions and reporting the R-squared and
adjusted R-squared.
For this exercise, we limit to a sample in which we observe catalog product identifiers,
where each product identifier represents a distinct product SKU that can be linked to
third-party catalogs to which eBay subscribes. These products are narrowly defined,
matching a product available at retail stores, such as: “Microsoft Xbox One, 500 GB
Black Console,” “Chanel No.5 3.4oz, Women’s Eau de Parfum,” and “The Sopranos The Complete Series (DVD, 2009).” We also construct a flag for the condition of the item
as being new or used. For each product-by-condition cell, we compute what we refer
to as a reference price (as in Einav et al. (2015)), which is the average price of sold fixed
price listings of the same product and condition over the time frame of our sample that
did not have the Best Offer option enabled, limiting to product-by-condition cells with
at least 20 such transactions. Therefore, these reference prices are computed entirely
outside of our sample, as our sample consists of Best-Offer-enabled listings. For each
thread in our bargaining data, we then compute a normalized price by dividing the
final sales price (when a sale occurred) by the reference price for that product.
While it has the advantage of offering a reference price for the value of a product,
the construction of this sample imposes an opaque form of selection. It rules out oneof-a-kind listings, and in this way may differ substantially from our main sample. In
Appendix B we replicate Table 1 for this sample and discuss the differences.

Notes: This table presents R2 and adjusted R2 coefficients from regressions of three dependent variables—normalized prices
conditional on sale (see text for a discussion of the construction of reference prices), a dummy for whether the thread ends in a
sale, and the number of offers—where we vary both the condition of the item and the inclusion of buyer, seller, and product fixed
effects.

19

The results are displayed in Table 2, separately for new items (columns 1–3) and
used items (columns 4–6). For each of the three outcomes—normalized price, a dummy
for whether the bargaining thread ended in agreement, and the number of offers—we
find that buyer fixed effects explain more of the variation in the outcome than do seller
fixed effects or product fixed effects. Specifically, over 83% of the variance in prices
is explained by buyer fixed effects alone, while only 45–60% is explained by seller or
product fixed effects. Variation in sales and the number of offers is also explained
approximately twice as well by buyer fixed effects than by seller or product fixed effects.
This finding may be unsurprising, as there are many more buyer fixed effects.
When we look at the adjusted R2 values, the story is rather more subtle. For new
products, product identity is substantially more relevant for predicting prices, but
not for used ones—this is intuitive, as used products introduce heterogeneity poorly
captured by product identifiers. In terms of the probability that a bargaining thread is
successful or the number of offers, the buyer fixed effects are also favored, and the seller
effects appear to explain more than the product fixed effects. We take this as evidence
that, except in the case of new products where there is a clear outside option for both
parties, buyer characteristics are of first-order importance for understanding bargaining
outcomes. Seller characteristics also appear to be more important than the product
identity in explaining variance in outcomes, suggesting that the traits of players play
an important role in bargaining. We will return to this finding in Section 4.4 when we
study buyer and seller characteristics influencing bargaining outcomes.

4.3

Coasian Dynamics and Price Convergence

We next examine patterns of price convergence (or non-convergence) over the duration
of the bargaining sequence. A large portion of the theoretical bargaining literature (see,
for example, Fudenberg et al. (1985) or Gul et al. (1986)) has focused on models that
produce Coasian dynamics, with high-value buyers and low-value sellers agreeing
earlier in a bargaining game than low-value buyers or high-value sellers, leading to a
gradual increase in buyer offers and gradual decrease in sellers offers over the duration
of a given bargaining sequence.
In each panel of Figures 7 and 8 we plot, on the vertical axis, the average amount of
the offer and, on the horizontal axis, the period of the game in which the offer is made,

include sequences ending in agreement and panels on the right include those ending in

sequences ending in even periods ended with the seller declining (and the buyer not
taking any further action) or the seller accepting, and those ending in odd periods ended
with the buyer accepting or declining. Each panel also displays the average change in
offer price the seller makes from one offer to the next, averaged across all periods of the
game, and similarly for the buyer. In creating these figures, we treat periods in which a
seller declines a buyer offer and the buyer follows up with an additional counteroffer as

periods in which the seller did not decline but rather countered at her most recent offer
(or at the list price in the case where the list price is the most recent price stated by the
seller).
Each panel of Figures 7 and 8 displays a clear pattern of buyer offers increasing and
seller offers decreasing, consistent with Coasian dynamics. Several other interesting
patterns also emerge. Panel A of Figure 7 demonstrates that, in games that ended
in period 4 with the seller accepting, on average, the game proceeds as follows: the
list price is approximately $120; the buyer then counters at about $75; the seller then
counters at -$13.37 less than the list price; the buyer then counters at $11.58 above
his previous offer; the seller then accepts. In Panel B, the same pattern of (seller list
22

price, buyer counter, seller counter, buyer counter) ends with the seller declining. In
contrast to Panel A, however, the overall price level in Panel B is much higher (the list
price is about $200 on average), the gap between buyer offers and seller offers is larger,
the seller’s per-offer change in price is much lower (-$5.64), and the buyer’s per-offer
change in price is higher ($14.31). This suggests that bargaining games in which the
seller budges very little early on are likely to end in disagreement, in spite of the buyer
conceeding to an even greater degree.
A comparison of Panels C and D of Figure 7 shows that the gap between buyer and
seller offers is larger in Panel D (where the buyer declines the seller’s last offer) than in
Panel C (where the buyer accepts). However, the per-offer change in buyer and seller
prices appear very similar in both panels. Figure 8 displays similar patterns, with games
ending in period 6 with the seller accepting (Panel A) showing a greater degree of price
convergence (and in a particular a greater degree of seller concession) than those ending
in the same period with the seller declining (Panel B); and games ending in period 7
with the buyer accepting (Panel C) appearing similar to those ending in the same period
with the buyer declining (Panel D). One feature of the data that can be seen clearly in
Figure 8 is that, on average, the rate of convergence from a player’s offer to that player’s
next offer is remarkably constant across periods of the game; the convergence does not
appear to speed up or slow down as the game progresses.
Another interesting feature in Panel C of Figure 8 is that the final, agreed-upon price
(proposed by the seller at t = 6 and accepted by the buyer at t = 7) lies precisely at a
point where the buyer and seller offer lines would have intersected had these lines been
extrapolated using only the period 1–5 offers. This same relationship holds roughly in
each of the agreement panels (A and C) of Figures 7 and 8. This suggests that, using
the level of initial offers of each player and the rate of change of these offers early in
the game, it may be possible to predict quite well the final offer and final period of the
game.

4.4

Bargaining Power

An additional feature of many theoretical models of bargaining is that players with
more bargaining power obtain a greater share of the surplus. This bargaining power is
captured differently in different contexts. In some models, such as Rubinstein (1982)
23

and Rubinstein (1985), bargaining power is explicitly represented by a player’s patience (discount factor). In other bargaining models, in particular many recent models
applied in empirical research in bargaining settings (e.g. Crawford and Yurukoglu
2012; Grennan 2013), bargaining power is instead a reduced-form feature of the model
rather than an underlying primitive, with a direct correspondence to the share of the
surplus the player would receive in a static Nash bargaining game, where both players
agree to maximize the total surplus weighted by the bargaining power weights (see
Binmore et al. 1986). In these models, bargaining power can represent concepts such as
a bargaining party’s negotiation skill or experience.
Starting with patience, we use a simple, yet novel approach to identify buyers who
may have a greater degree of patience than others. In particular, we identify patient
buyers as those who, ex-post (after the bargaining ended), chose the slowest shipping
option when multiple options were available. Namely, at checkout, a buyer often
can choose between several shipping options, where faster shipping costs more that
slower shipping. Hence, by revealed preference, buyers who choose a slower shipping
method reveal that they are willing to wait rather than spend more money, and are
thus more patient than buyers who opt for faster shipping at a higher price. Turning
to experience, we measure experienced buyers and sellers using their accumulated
bargaining experience as shown in Table 1.
Table 3 shows the results of regressing the bargained outcome on our measures of
buyer patience and both parties’ experience. For this analysis, we again rely on the
subsample of the data used in creating Table 2, for which we can compute a reference
price for each good. (See Appendix B for a discussion of, and summary statistics for,
that sample.) As in Table 2, we treat new products (columns 1–3) separately from used
products (column 4–6). Our dependent variable in each of the regressions in Table 3 is
the final price from a bargaining transaction in which agreement occurred, divided by
the reference price for that item.
We find that, for used products, more patient buyers tend to have lower final prices
in bargaining, consistent with the theoretical models. Column 4 demonstrates that
buyers who selected the slowest shipping option obtained prices that were lower by 7.2
precentage points (of the reference price). Column 6 controls for both experience and
patience, and finds a similar premium for patient buyers, who obtain prices that are 5.7

percentage points lower than than less-patient buyers. For new goods, the relationship
between patience and prices is not statistically significant.
Table 3 also demonstrates that, for both used and new items, more experienced
buyers tend to obtain lower prices, although the point estimates only stastically significant (and are larger in magnitude) in the used goods sample. Column 5 suggests
and that 1% change in the buyer experience measure is associated with a decrease in
prices corresponding to 1.8 percent of the reference price. When controlling for patience
as well (column 6), the estimate increases in magnitude to 2.4 percentage points. For
seller experience in both new and used good markets we find a similarly intuitive
result: sellers with more experience tend to obtain higher prices, with the price increase
ranging from 1.4 to 6.4 percent of the reference price, although this is result disappears
in column 6 when controlling for patience.
The fact that, overall, the strongest results appear in the used goods sample is
consistent with our findings in Table 2. There we documented that buyer fixed effects
played less of a role in explaining price outcomes for new products, which tend to
have a better defined market price and hence for such products there is less scope for
bargaining.

Observed Behavior and “Split-the-Difference” Offers

We now turn to players’ choices of counteroffers to previously made offers. In particular,
we are interested in how the offer in period t relates to the offers in periods s < t.
Throughout this section we will use the following notation. As above, let t = 0, 1, ..., 7
represent the different periods of the bargaining game. We use the term “player t”
to refer to the player whose turn it is in period t (so player t is the seller for even t
and the buyer for odd t). At t = 0, the seller chooses a Buy It Now price, which we
denote p0 . Any offer made at period t will be denoted pt . Thus, p1 is the buyer’s first
offer, p2 is the seller’s first counteroffer, etc. Let γ1 = p1 /p0 , and, for t = 2, 3, ..., 6, let
γt ∈ [0, 1] be the weight such that pt = γt pt−1 + (1 − γt ) pt−2 . Therefore, γt represents
the weight that player t places upon the opponent’s previous offer, and 1 − γt represents
the weight the player places on his or her own previous offer. Note that by definition,
p1 = γ1 p0 + (1 − γ1 )0, so we can think of the buyer’s “previous” offer when he makes
his first offer as his bliss point of paying nothing for the good.
Figure 9 displays histograms of these offer weights for the bargaining threads
observed in the data. For simplicity, for this figure, we limit to threads with back-andforth sequences corresponding to the left side of the game tree displayed in Figure 4;
that is, we focus on threads with a series of offers and counteroffers, while ignoring
threads in which the seller declines but the buyer continues to make additional offers.
Panel A plots a histogram of γ1 , Panel B plots a histogram of γ2 , limiting to those
threads in the data in which a period-2 offer was made, and so on.
Several interesting patterns are evident in this analysis. We note first that offers
skew away from concession (γt skews towards zero) with the exception of the first
offer that skews towards the BIN price. Second, some common mass points emerge,
in particular, counteroffers that are halfway between the previous two offers, or “splitthe-difference” counteroffers. The pattern even holds for buyers’ first offers, where the
modal initial offer is half of the BIN. The mid-point offer is also the modal offer for the
first seller counter. In subsequent seller counters, the modal offer gives zero or nearly
zero weight to the opponent’s most recent offer, and second only to this choice is again
the split-the-difference point.
This pattern is consistent with previously documented laboratory evidence and
behavioral economic theory (Roth and Malouf 1979; Roth 1985; Binmore et al. 1985;

Observations

Notes: This table presents results from regressions where the dependent variable is γt (see text for a discussion of the construction
of this variable) and the independent variables are measures of buyer and seller experience. Note that buyers make offers when
t is odd, and sellers make offers when t is even. The number of observations changes across columns (becomes smaller) because
fewer observations reached later periods of bargaining. *: α = 0.14, **: α = 0.05, and ***: α = 0.01.

Bolton 1991; Bolton and Ockenfels 2000; Charness and Rabin 2002; Andreoni and
Bernheim 2009), in which market participants may care about notions of fairness and
may favor a split-the-difference strategy in negotiations. Interestingly, however, the
split-the-difference pattern we observe is not a pattern of splitting surplus between the
two parties, as the surplus is not necessarily known to the players given the potential
presence of incomplete information about opponent valuations. Rather, here, the splitthe-difference phenomenon we observe regards splitting the two most recent offers,
regardless of how those offers relate to surplus.
In Table 4, we explore how these offer weights relate to bargaining power as measured by buyer and seller experience. We run regressions of each stage’s weight on
buyer and seller experience (measured as in Table 3). The coefficients of the linear-log
regressions can therefore be interpreted as the effect on the proportion conceded (γ).
Recall that odd t represent buyer turns. In column 3, for example, the significant positive coefficient on seller experience indicates that a one percent change in the seller
experience measure is associated with a 0.002 increase in the weight placed by the
buyer on the seller’s previous offer, and the significant negative coefficient on buyer
experience in column 3 indicates that a one percent change in the buyer experience
measure is associated with a 0.012 decrease in the buyer’s concession. Thus, in their
period 3 offers, buyers tend to concede more to more experienced sellers and concede
less if they themselves are more experienced. This same pattern is observed in the
period 5 offers in column 5.

28

Results for seller offers weights can be seen in even columns. In columns 2 and
4 we find the same patterns for sellers that we observed for buyers: sellers tend to
concede more to more experienced buyers and concede less if they themselves are more
experienced. For example, we find that, in seller’s period 2 offers, a one percent change
in the buyer experience measure is associated with at 0.003 increase in the amount
conceded by the seller, and a one percent change in the seller experience measure is
associated with a 0.004 decrease in the seller’s concession.
This pattern is remarkably robust across time periods and across both buyers and
sellers, with two minor exceptions. First, in column 1, we see that an increase in the
seller experience measure is associated with a decrease in the buyer’s concession. We
expect that this is an artifact of selection due to the seller being the player to set the
initial price (if more experienced sellers tend to set higher initial prices, buyer offers on
these listings will appear to be conceding less to the seller, all else equal). Second, in
column 6, we see that more experienced sellers appear to concede more in their final
offer weight (γ6 ). We suspect this is positive because experienced sellers are more likely
to be aware that this is the final offer, and are therefore more generous.
We now explore how a player’s choice of offer, as measured by the weight, γt , relates
to later outcomes in the bargaining game. We create a measure for whether the offer
is a ‘split’ offer by creating an indicator that is equal to one if γt is equal to 0.5 (after
being rounded to the nearest hundredth) for each t ∈ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We find that about 7
percent of offers are split offers by this definition.8 We estimate a local linear regression
of an indicator for whether each offer is accepted on both this split indicator and the
underlying γt .9 Results are shown in Table 5.
Table 5 demonstrates that, as would be expected, the coefficient on the concession
rate (γ) is positive: the more a player concedes relative to previous offers, the more
likely it is that the opposing player accepts the offer. The key result of Table 5, however,
is that an offer in bargaining is more likely to be accepted if it is a split offer than if it is
not, and this effect is both statistically significant and surprisingly large in magnitude,
8 Broader definitions of split, by rounding γ to the nearest five hundredths or nearest tenth yield 9
t
percent and 14 percent split rates, respectively.
9 We follow Fan and Gij̀bels (1992) in the construction of the optimal variable bandwidth for estimation
of the effect at 0.5 using a rectangular kernel. See their paper for details.

Observations

Notes: This table displays the results from a linear regression of the probability of an offer being accepted regressed on the offer
weight, γt , and on an indicator for whether γt is approximately equal to 0.5. Columns 1 through 6 display results for γt for
t = 1, ..., 6. *: α = 0.14, **: α = 0.05, and ***: α = 0.01.

as well as being curiously stable across periods of the bargaining, lying in a range of
5–10% independent of what point in the bargaining game the split offer occurs.
We supplement this approach with a more flexible fit of γt and plot fractional
polynomial fits of acceptance and γt in Figure 10. As can be seen, the underlying
relationship between γt and acceptance is positive and split offers are substantially
more likely to be accepted. This is particularly surprising because, taken seriously, it
implies a non-monotonicity in the likelihood of acceptance—that is, a player is more
likely to accept a split-the-difference offer than an even slightly more favorable offer.

Conclusion

In this paper we analyzed a novel dataset of bilateral bargaining used by millions of
users in a live ecosystem. We documented a number of facts consistent with rational
theories of bargaining behavior. First, we found small but positive amounts of delay and
frequent disagreement. We also found evidence favoring fixed over proportional costs
of bargaining. This is important for understanding mechanism selection but also for
thinking about the external validity of experimental studies of low-stakes bargaining: if
our conclusion is correct, behavioral patterns in high- and low-stakes bargaining will be
very different.
Second, we found evidence that variance in bargaining outcomes (including prices,
the probability of trade, and the number of bargaining offers) is better explained by
variance in player characteristics rather than variance in the good being bargained
over. In particular, characteristcs of buyers, moreso than sellers, appear to be important
in explaining variance in bargaining outcomes. We analyzed specific types of player
characteristics that are arguably related to bargaining power, namely buyer and seller
experience and buyer patience. We found that more patient or more experienced players
obtain better deals. We also found that more experienced players appear to concede
more in making their counteroffers when facing a more experienced opponent, and
concede less when they themselves are more experienced.
Third, we analyzed the convergence of buyer and seller offers over the duration of
a bargaining interaction, and found that a characteristic feature of bargaining threads
that end in disagreement is that the seller budges very little even in the beginning of the
back-and-forth bargaining. We do not find a similar result for buyer obstinacy.
Finally, we offered descriptive evidence of “splitting-the-difference” behavior, a result that supports the incorporation of behavioral elements to understanding bargaining
dynamics. We documented the surprising fact that counteroffers lying halfway between
the two preceding offers are significantly more likely to be accepted by the opposing
party than are offers which are even slightly more favorable to the opposing party.
We believe that the rich data we used herein, which is henceforth now publicly
available, offers opportunities to explore the ways in which people bargain, and can
help shed light on what determines bargaining outcomes in the real world.

Appendix
A

Sample Construction

Starting with our original sample of approximately 92 million Best Offer listings, we
imposed a handful of sample restrictions. Note that all sample restrictions are imposed
at the listing level. That is, even if the sample restriction pertains to characteristics
of an offer, we removed all listing that are associated with any offer that violates the
restriction. In total, this leaves us with a sample of 82 million listings.
The sample restrictions are as follows:
Restrictions on Listing Attributes
(L1) Listing price at or below $1000.
(L2) In the event of a sale, the sale price is at or below the listing price.
Restrictions on Thread Attributes
(T1) All offers are at or below the listing price.
(T2) Neither the buyer nor the seller makes more than three offers.
(T3) For all offers with a status of “countered,” a counter-offer exists in the dataset.
(T4) For all offers accepted, there are no subsequent offers in the thread.
The quantitative significance of these sample restrictions is described in Table A1.
Restriction (L1), the largest, is an arbitrary restriction to simplify the analysis and the
graphics and excludes approximately 10% of our sample. The second listing-level
restriction, (L2), binds rarely, for only 42 thousand listings. It is possible that it happens
because the sellers have agreed to bundle other products or services with the sale,
however this is abnormal and inconsistent with eBay guidelines for communication in
Best Offer bargaining.
Among the thread-level restrictions, (T1) is the most significant, affecting approximately 335 thousand listings. We suspect that it happens when an offer is made and

the seller subsequently revises her price downward. In that case we only observe the
final listing price, not the standing listing price that the buyer saw when making the
offer. Indeed, we see from Table 1 that about 26% of listings have their prices adjusted
at some point.
In addition to imposing this restriction on our sample, we check to make sure that all
of our results are robust to excluding listings that were ever revised (results available on
request). Restrictions (T2) - (T4) are rarely binding, and we do not have an explanation
for them besides data processing errors.

B

Reference Price Sample

Here we offer, in Table B1, an analogue of Table 1 describing the subsample of listings
for which we are able to construct reference prices. A reference price is defined as a
price outcome for a listing with an identical title and item condition identifier (e.g.,
new vs. used). We restrict attention to cases where the reference set has at least twenty
elements.
The advantage of this subsample is that we have some evidence on the expected
outcome price, so we can think about whether the buyer got a “deal.” However, this
comes at the cost of a somewhat opaque sample construction. By ruling out one-of-a-

Appendix-2

kind listings, for which no reference price will exist, it biases the sample towards the
kinds of listings for which we expect relatively less bargaining.
Consistent with this intuition, we see that these listings are substantially more likely
to sell (47% as compared to 22%), but that there is less “room to bargain.” Sale prices
are substantially closer to list prices (91% as compared to 83%), and bargaining threads
are substantially less likely to succeed (25% as compared to 45%). However, we still
find that just over half of listings that sell in this sample are bargained (.227/.435 yields
52%).

Figures 5 and 6 were constructed as LOWESS plots. To make this feasible, given the
large sample size of the dataset, we subsampled. As Panel A of Figure 5 makes clear,
however, stratification is required to obtain an adequate sample of listings at prices
above $100. Therefore we sampled 70,000 listings from 20 bins, each $50 in length
(inclusive on the upper extreme). Figure C1 presents two histograms to document the
subsampling: Panel A is a histogram with a bin width that reflects the stratification
strategy, and Panel B has 100 bins of length $10. The regular peaks in Panel B reflect
the prevalence of round numbers (since our bins are constructed to be inclusive on the
upper extreme). The increasing use of round numbers at higher prices may be affecting
sale price outcomes from Figure 5, consistent with Backus et al. (2016).
