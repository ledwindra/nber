Taxing the Rich More: Preliminary Evidence from the 2013 Tax Increase
Emmanuel Saez
NBER Working Paper No. 22798
November 2016
JEL No. H31
ABSTRACT
This paper provides preliminary evidence on behavioral responses to taxation around the 2013 tax
increase that raised top marginal tax rates on capital income by about 9.5 points and on labor
income by about 6.5 points. Using published tabulated tax statistics from the Statistics of Income
division of the IRS, we find that reported top 1% incomes were significantly higher in 2012 than
in 2013, implying a large short-run elasticity of reported income with respect to the net-of-tax
rate in excess of one. This large short-run elasticity is due to income retiming for tax avoidance
purposes and is particularly high for realized capital gains and dividends, and highest at the very
top of the income distribution. However, comparing 2011 and 2015 top incomes uncovers only a
small medium-term response to the tax increase as top income shares resumed their upward trend
after 2013. Overall, we estimate that at most 20%of the projected tax revenue increase from the
2013 tax reform is lost through behavioral responses. This implies that the 2013 tax increase was
an efficient way to raise revenue.

1. Introduction
One of the most contentious aspects of the tax policy debate is the proper level
of taxation of top individual income earners. This question takes particular
importance in the United States where income concentration has been growing
dramatically over the last 40 years and now stands at extremely high levels.
Piketty and Saez (2003) and Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2016) show that the
share of pre-tax income going to the top 1% of income earners has more than
doubled from less than 10% in the late 1970s to over 20% in recent years.
Progressive individual income taxation modulates the tax burden by size of
income and hence is the most direct tool to address growing income
concentration. At the same time, it is crucial to understand the economic
consequences of taxing the rich more to be able to pick the best tax policy
regarding top incomes.
Tax changes naturally offer opportunities to learn about these economic
consequences. Since 1980, there has been significant disagreement in the U.S.
policy debate over how to tax the rich. Republican administrations have typically
decreased taxes, while their Democratic counterparts have typically increased
them (although not enough to reverse the decreases). The most recent change
took place in 2013 when the top marginal tax rate on capital income increased by
about 9.5 points and the top marginal tax rate on labor income increased by
about 6.5 points. These increases were largely concentrated within the top 1%
and were due to the combination of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)
surtaxes and the expiration of the 2001 Bush tax cuts for top earners. These tax
increases for 2013 surpass in magnitude the 1993 top tax rate increases of the
Clinton administration, and are effectively the largest increase in top tax rates
since the 1950s. Therefore, they offer a unique opportunity to learn about the
economic consequences of taxing the rich more.
In this paper, we present preliminary evidence on the effects of these tax
increases. We build upon the large existing literature on estimating behavioral
responses to taxation (Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz [2012] provide a recent and
comprehensive survey) to offer a simple and transparent analysis of the 2013 tax
2

increase. We follow the literature and focus on estimating the elasticity of pre-tax
reported income with respect to the net-of-tax rate (one minus the marginal tax
rate) for various income groups. This parameter is central for estimating the
efficiency costs of taxation and for optimal tax analysis. Our analysis uses only
the tabulated published statistics produced by the Statistics of Income division of
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We discuss extensively why we think that
these timely and publicly available tabulations are sufficient to assess the broad
picture of the behavioral responses to the 2013 tax increase. Our goal is partly
pedagogical and shows how simple tabulated information can already yield a
number of results that are transparent and easy to understand. Naturally, as we
discuss in detail in the concluding section, this broad picture analysis could be
further refined using micro level data, and more sophisticated empirical methods
as some studies have started doing. Our empirical analysis generates three main
results.
First, we analyze short-term responses which are the easiest to identify by
comparing 2012 and 2013. The tax change was not formally enacted until early
January 2013. However, after the re-election of Barack Obama in early
November 2012, it was almost certain that top tax rates would increase
significantly, leaving 2 months (November and December 2012) to accelerate
income realizations and avoid the 2013 tax rate increases. We find that reported
top 1% incomes were abnormally high in 2012 and abnormally low in 2013,
which is most likely due to retiming of income in order to avoid the high tax rates
of 2013. We estimate that top 1% income earners shifted about 11% of their
2013 incomes into 2012. This implies a large short-run elasticity (in excess of
one) of reported income with respect to the net-of-tax rate. This large short-run
elasticity is particularly high for realized capital gains and dividends but is also
present although less pronounced for other forms of income such as business
profits, and wages and salaries. We also find that the short-term elasticity is
much higher for very top income groups such as the top 0.1% (or the top .01%)
than for the top 1% excluding the top .1%. This shows that the ability to retime
income in the short-term is likely limited to very top earners only. This large short-

3

term retiming responses for top earners line up well with earlier findings in the
literature which had also uncovered large retiming responses for realized capital
gains in 1986 (Auerbach, 1988) and for stock-option exercises in 1992
(Goolsbee, 2000) following earlier tax rate increases.
Second, we analyze medium-term responses comparing 2011 and 2015.
2011 is the last year unaffected by the 2013 reform as it was clear that tax rates
would not change in 2012 due to political gridlock. Over this four-year horizon,
top 1% income shares have continued to increase at almost the same rate as
from 2009 to 2011, the first two years of recovery for top incomes after the Great
Recession. Hence, this suggests that the top tax rate increase has not depressed
top incomes in the medium-run and the corresponding medium-term elasticity we
obtain is small, around .25. However, it is important to emphasize that this
medium-term elasticity is not as compellingly identified as the short-term
elasticity. Our small medium-run elasticity estimates rely on the strong
assumption that, absent the tax increase, the top 1% income share would have
kept growing on its previous post Great Recession trend. We show that this
identification assumption holds in the experiences of the previous two recessions
of 1991 and 2001.
Third, we consider specifically the case of charitable giving. Charitable
giving is a useful element to consider because it can be deducted from income
for tax purposes. As a result, the tax incentives for charitable giving move in
opposite direction as those for reported income. In the short-term, after the 2013
tax increase became clear, it would have been tax efficient to postpone
charitable giving into 2013 as charitable giving would reduce taxes more with the
higher tax rates of 2013. However, in contrast to the strong retiming observed for
income, we do not observe retiming of charitable contributions from 2012 and
2013 among top 1% income earners. To the contrary, charitable contributions
follow closely reported income: they spike in 2012 and are depressed in 2013.
This implies that, on average, top earners did not use charitable giving

4

strategically as a way to avoid taxes. 1 In the long-term since the 1960s, we
observe a very parallel trend between top 1% incomes and the charitable
contributions of top 1% income earners. This strongly suggests that the
extraordinary rise in US top income shares documented by Piketty and Saez
(2003) reflects a real phenomenon and is not due to tax avoidance. Indeed, if top
incomes in the 1960s or 1970s had been very high in real terms but very low as
reported on tax returns because of tax avoidance, we should have observed very
high charitable contributions relative to reported incomes among the rich (even
more so given the tax incentives).
Overall, our evidence is in line with the literature showing strong shortterm behavioral elasticities due to tax avoidance (in the present case, retiming of
income) and much smaller medium-term behavioral elasticities (Saez, Slemrod,
and Giertz, [2012]). Our estimates imply that the revenue lost due to behavioral
responses relative to the mechanical projected revenue increase is at most 20%,
which makes the 2013 tax increase an efficient way to raise extra revenue.
Therefore, the 2013 tax reform successfully raised extra revenue in a progressive
fashion, as the tax increases were mostly concentrated among the top 1%. At the
same time, our evidence suggests that, by itself, the 2013 tax increase will not be
sufficient to curb the secular increase in income concentration that the US has
experienced since the 1970s.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the details of the
2013 income tax reform and the potential channels of behavioral responses to
taxation it creates. Section 3 presents our empirical findings. It analyzes in turn
short-term retiming responses, medium-term responses, and charitable giving
among the rich. Next, it discusses the long-term link between top incomes and
top tax rates, and finally evaluates the efficiency costs of the 2013 tax increase.
1

There are other features of the tax code that could potentially have been exploited to
retime income away from 2013. For example, since 2010, it is possible to make
conversions of traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs with no income limitations. While we see a
spike in Roth conversions in 2012, this spike is very small relative to the stock of
traditional IRAs that could potentially be converted. This shows that only a small minority
of high income earners with IRA balances choose to avoid taxes through Roth IRA
conversion.

Section 4 concludes and discusses avenues for future research analyzing the
2013 tax reform using micro-data instead of tabulated data.

2. The 2013 Tax Reform
In this section, we describe in detail the 2013 tax increase for top earners and the
behavioral incentives it created. The effects of the 2013 tax reform on federal
marginal tax rates is summarized in Table 1.
2.1 Description of the Reform
The 2013 tax reform was a combination of two simultaneous tax increases, the
surtax on high income earners due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the
expiration of the Bush tax cuts on high income earners. Let us describe each
component in turn.2
Affordable Care Act (ACA) surtax: The ACA surtax adds a marginal tax rate of
3.8% on investment income and 0.9% on labor income for high income earners.
This tax roughly affects the top 2.5% income earners.3 The rationale for this
differential tax rate on investment vs. labor income is to align their tax treatment
as labor income also faces a 2.9% FICA (Federal Insurance Contribution Act)
payroll tax rate with no cap. Some forms of income (such as non-passive profits
of S-corporations, pension distributions, or other income) are neither considered
as investment nor labor income and hence are exempt from the ACA surtax and
FICA payroll taxes as well. Non-passive profits of S-corporations are in reality a
2

The Tax Policy Center provides a comprehensive description of the 2013 tax reform at
http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/individual Viard (2013) also presents an
excellent description of the 2013 tax increase focusing specifically on capital income.
3
As explained in Table 1, the 3.8% surtax on investment income applies to taxpayers
with Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) above $250,000 for married joint filers, and $200,000
for singles and heads of households. The 0.9% surtax on labor income applies to labor
income above $250,000 for married joint filers (and $200,000 for singles and heads of
households).

6

mix of investment and labor income and hence this exemption is a clear loophole
in the design of the ACA surtax.
The ACA surtax took place in 2013 but was enacted in March 2010 and
hence was anticipated well in advance, but until the presidential election was
decided in early November 2012, there was a slight probability that the ACA
surtax could have been repealed.
Expiration of the Bush Tax Cuts: The Bush administration tax cuts of 2001 were
initially designed to expire at the end of 2010 but were extended for 2 more years
in December 2010. In 2012, it was clear that the fate of the Bush tax cuts would
depend on the results of the 2012 Presidential election. When President Obama
was re-elected on November 6, 2012, it became almost certain that the Bush tax
cuts would be repealed for top income earners. The exact form of the repeal did
not materialize until January 2nd, 2013 due to protracted negotiations between
the Obama administration and Congress.4 In particular, the thresholds at which
top tax rates would increase were uncertain. The enacted repeal, the American
Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), affected top income earners in two main
ways:
1) Top bracket addition: ATRA added a top tax bracket which increased the top
tax rates from 35% to 39.6% for ordinary income and from 15% to 20% for
dividends and realized capital gains. This new top tax bracket started at
$450,000 of taxable income for married joint filers ($400,000 for single filers,
$425,000 for head of households filers). It affects about the top 1% of income
earners. Approximately, this top bracket increases federal marginal tax rates by
about 5 points across all forms of income (5 points for dividends and realized
capital gains, 4.6 points for ordinary income) for top 1% income earners.
2) Phasing-out of itemized deductions (Pease provision): itemized deductions are
reduced by 3% of AGI in excess of $300,000 for married joints filers ($250,000
4

It was always clear however that the Bush tax cuts would expire for high income
earners. The Obama administration had the upper hand because doing nothing would
have resulted in the Bush tax cuts expiring for everybody, an outcome both parties
wanted to avoid.

7

for single filers, and $275,000 for head of household filers) up to 80% of itemized
deductions. Hence, this provision increases the marginal tax rate by 3% of the
federal marginal tax rate, i.e. 1.2 points for income in the top bracket
(1.2%=3%*.396). The marginal tax rate on ordinary income is the relevant
concept here as long as tax filers in the top bracket have some ordinary income
(and not only tax preferred income). Over 90% of top 1% income earners are
affected by this provision so we assume it applies systematically in our marginal
tax rate computations.5
ATRA also re-introduced the personal exemption phase-out. This phaseout increases marginal tax rates for high but not super high income earners. For
joint married filers, the phase-out starts at $300,000 of AGI for joint married filers
and is completed at $425,000 of AGI. Hence, most top 1% income earners are
above the personal exemption phase-out. We will therefore ignore this provision
in this study.
Taxpayers who pay the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) are much less
affected by the top tax rate increase and the Pease provision. However, the AMT
affects mostly high but not very high income earners as the AMT top marginal tax
rate of 28% is lower than the ordinary tax rate (even more so after the 2013
reform). Hence, the vast majority of taxpayers in the top 1% (and especially the
top .1%) are typically above the AMT and hence not affected by the AMT.6
Table 1 summarizes the effect of the 2013 tax reform on top federal
marginal tax rates combining federal individual income taxation and uncapped
federal payroll taxes. The first three columns present the pre-reform marginal tax
5

Less than 10% of top 1% income earners hit the 80% cap. These taxpayers are mostly
concentrated in states with no income taxes (based on the author’s computations using
the Public Use tax return data file for year 2010).
6
Income tax statistics for 2014 show that 36.7% of taxpayers with income above $.5m
(roughly the top 1%) pay some AMT, and 19.4% of taxpayers with income above $2m
(roughly the top .1%) pay some AMT (Tables 1.1 and 3.1 of US Treasury, Statistics of
Income for year 2014). The AMT treats dividends and realized capital gains very
similarly as the standard tax system (so that their tax rate also goes up from 15 to 20%
for high income taxpayers). The AMT also imposes higher marginal tax rates in its AMT
exemption phase-out range so that the reduction in actual marginal tax rates is actually
quite modest. For simplicity, we ignore the AMT in our marginal tax rate computations.

rates, the post-reform marginal tax rates, and the change pre to post-reform,
respectively. The next three columns show the income thresholds at which the
tax changes apply for married joint filers, heads of households, and singles.
Panel A presents the health care tax (including the uncapped portion of FICA
payroll taxes on earnings). This tax applies to labor and investment income when
total gross income is above the stated thresholds. Panel B presents the individual
income tax including the change in the top bracket tax rate and the limitation on
itemized deductions. Ordinary income includes all forms of taxable income other
than qualified dividends and long-term realized capital gains, which are taxed at
lower rates (as shown in the table). Panel C shows the total effect of the 2013 tax
reform on marginal tax rates for each specific income component. Panel D shows
the total effect of the 2013 tax reform on marginal tax rates by income groups.
Panel D1 considers income including capital gains while Panel D2 considers
income excluding capital gains. In panels D1 and D2, the average is taken using
the income composition of the top income groups in 2011 (the latest year not
affected by the 2013 tax reform). Panels D1 and D2 show that the 2013 tax
reform increased marginal tax rates by about 7 points on average for top income
groups, with slightly higher increases at the very top (top .1% and top .01%
groups) and for income including realized capital gains (Panel D1). Note also that
the average marginal tax rate decreases with income (both pre and post-reform)
and particularly for income including realized capital gains because the fraction of
income that is tax preferred (capital gains and dividends) is higher at the very
top.
In sum, the effects of the 2013 tax increase are limited to taxpayers with
income above $250,000, i.e. approximately the top 2.5% of income earners.
Within the top 2.5%, the effects of the 2013 tax increases apply fully to
individuals with gross income above about $500,000, approximately the top 1%.
For this top 1% group, the 2013 tax reform increases the marginal tax rate on
labor income by about 6.5 percentage points and it increases the marginal tax
rate on capital income by about 9.5 percentage points. Overall, taking into
account that some income forms are exempted from ACA, the total average

9

effect on the marginal tax rate of the top 1% is slightly above 7 percentage points
(Table 1).
2.2 Expected behavioral responses:
What are the expected responses to the 2013 tax reform based on the
voluminous past literature on behavioral responses to taxation? Let us analyze in
turn expected short-term responses, medium-term responses, and distinguish
between real responses vs. tax avoidance responses as the literature has done
following the key impetus of Slemrod (1995). As we know from the literature,
behavioral responses are largest along the tax avoidance margin, whenever a
tax reform creates tax avoidance opportunities. It is much harder to uncover
compellingly real responses.
1) Retiming responses: The 2013 top tax rate increase and its magnitude
became almost certain after the 2012 Presidential election in early November
2012. A simple way individual taxpayers can respond to the tax change is by retiming income from 2013 (when tax rates will be higher) toward 2012 (when tax
rates are still lower). Indeed, for top 1% income earners, shifting $100 in capital
income from 2013 to 2012 saves about $9.5 in taxes. Shifting $100 in labor
income from 2013 to 2012 saves about $6.5 in taxes. Hence, if re-timing income
is feasible for the taxpayer, it is certainly an attractive way to avoid some of the
2013 higher taxes. The past literature has shown that two categories of income
can lead to strong re-timing responses: realized capital gains and stock-option
exercises.
Taxpayers choose when to realize capital gains. Hence, realizing gains in
late 2012 is obviously tax-advantageous relative to realizing in 2013 or after. The
Tax Reform Act of 1986 increased the tax rate on realized capital gains from
20% to 28% and hence created a similarly strong incentive to accelerate realized
capital gains. This earlier tax rate increase affected almost all reported realized
capital gains. Auerbach (1988) documented a famously strong response along

10

this margin: capital gains realizations in 1986 were extremely high (twice as high
as in 1985) and were correspondingly depressed in 1987. As top 1% income
earners report about 80% of total realized capital gains (Piketty and Saez, 2003),
we should expect a strong aggregate response to the 2013 tax increase as well.
Similarly, executives who hold vested stock-options can time the date of
exercise of their stock-options. Profits from (most) exercised stock-options are
considered wage income for tax purposes, hence, such re-timing should create a
spike in wage income for top earners in 2012. The Clinton 1993 tax increase
created a similar incentive as it increased the top income tax rate from 31% to
39.6% (the reform did not affect the tax rate on realized capital gains). Goolsbee
(2000), using executive compensation data for publicly traded firms, documented
a large spike in stock-option realizations in 1992.
Therefore, we expect the re-timing responses along the realized capital
gains, and stock-option exercise dimension to be particularly large for the 2013
tax increase. Other forms of income could also be re-timed. Employer and
employees could potentially agree to shift wage income (such as bonuses) into
2012. Business income can be re-timed by postponing costs (such as deploying
investment) into 2013 and accelerating sales into 2012. Dividends, particularly in
closely held firms, could also be accelerated in 2012.7 For top bracket taxpayers,
pension distributions from individual accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs could
also be accelerated into 2012 (and save $4.6 per $100 shifted into 2012 as
pension income does not face the ACA surtax). In particular, for high-income
taxpayers owning IRA accounts, conversions from traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs
can be accelerated into 2012 (with no limit on the amount rolled over and no AGI
limit nor any age requirement). Converting a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA
requires paying income taxes on the converted amount (and no further tax will be
due when Roth IRA funds are eventually withdrawn).

7

Regular dividends of publicly traded firms are typically stable. However, even publicly
traded firms could make extra special dividend payments in 2012. See Chetty and Saez
(2005) for an analysis showing a strong response of dividends (and particularly special
dividends) among publicly traded firms to the earlier 2003 dividend tax cut.

11

Conversely, high income individuals have an incentive to postpone
charitable giving from 2012 to 2013 so that charitable giving offsets income
facing a higher marginal tax rate, saving $4.6 in taxes per $100 of postponed gift
(charitable giving cannot offset the ACA surtax). Indeed, a large literature has
shown that charitable giving can be fairly responsive to tax incentives particularly
in the short-run (see e.g., Clotfelter [1985] or Fack and Landais [2016] for
literature surveys). Hence, we should expect a trough in charitable giving in 2012
followed by a sharp increase in 2013.
2) Income shifting responses: The Tax Reform Act of 1986 is well known to have
generated a large shift in business income from the corporate sector toward the
individual sector (by converting C-corporations whose profits are first taxed by
the corporate income tax into S-corporations or partnerships that are passthrough entities whose profits are taxed solely at the individual level). See
Auerbach and Slemrod (1997) and Saez (2004) for detailed discussions. This
large shift occurred because, after 1986, it became more advantageous to
organize as a pass-through entity to be taxed solely at the individual level rather
than be a C-corporation and pay the corporate income tax (and then an
additional individual income tax when profits are distributed in the form of
dividends or realized capital gains). The 2013 individual income tax increase on
top earners is not large enough to reverse this logic. It still remains advantageous
to pay the top individual rate of 39.6% rather than the corporate income tax rate
of 35% plus some additional individual income tax when profits are distributed as
dividends or realized capital gains.8 The ACA surtax does not tax non-passive
profits from S-corporations while it does tax dividends and realized capital gains,
which is a further advantage of the S-corporation form. 9 Indeed, the 1993
individual top tax rate increase (from 31% to 39.6%) did not lead to a shift back
8

The corporate tax form makes sense only in the extreme case where a person will
never want to distribute dividends or realize profits before death. At death, unrealized
capital gains benefit from the step-up of basis and hence escape individual taxation
entirely.
9
Partnership profits in contrast are taxed by the ACA surtax (non-passive partnership
profits were already taxed by the Medicare uncapped payroll tax).

12

toward the corporate form and we should not expect to see such a shift with the
2013 reform.
Another important avenue for tax avoidance is to exploit the tax preferred
treatment of realized capital gains by trying to transform ordinary income into
realized capital gains. The most famous example is the carried interest for private
equity and hedge fund managers. The 2013 tax reform however increased tax
rates on realized capital gains slightly more than other forms of capital income
(see Table 1) and significantly more than on labor income. As a result, we should
not observe shifting toward realized capital gains.
3) Real responses: As just discussed, we should not expect the 2013 tax reform
to generate tax avoidance through permanent income shifting. Hence, any
permanent change in reported incomes after the 2013 tax reform (and after the
re-timing effects discussed above have phased out) should be due to real effects.
As discussed in Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva (2014), real changes in reported
incomes of top earners due to tax rate changes could be due to supply side
responses or rent-seeking responses.
Supply side responses: With the higher top tax rate, the marginal reward to work
and from returns on wealth is reduced, which could potentially lead to lower work
and savings, and reduce reported labor income and capital income. In the
literature on reported income responses, it is very difficult to estimate real
responses, especially at the high-income end. 10 The main challenge is that
measuring the actual work effort and savings of high-income earners is
particularly difficult given data availability.11 Perhaps a useful avenue for future

10

There is a large literature estimating the effects on work of means-tested transfer
programs and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). See Moffitt (1992, 2002) for
reviews of labor supply responses to welfare programs and the EITC.
11
One important and valuable exception is Moffitt and Wilhelm (2000) who used survey
of consumer finance data to measure the hours of work response to the Tax Reform Act
of 1986. They find that the surge in the taxable income of high-income individuals
between 1983 and 1989 was not accompanied by an increase in reported hours of work.
This suggests that the response to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was not due to supply
side responses.

13

research would be to look at retirement behavior of high-income earners, which
can be inferred reasonably well from tax data.
Rent-seeking responses: Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva (2014) define rentseeking responses as tax driven changes in the real incomes of top earners that
are not due to changes in the actual economic contribution of top earners but are
rather due to changes in how much income top earners can extract (at the
expense of the rest of the economy). Obtaining compelling evidence of rentseeking effects is also challenging.
In the case of the 2013 tax increase, we want to analyze whether the tax
increase did slow down the path of growth of top incomes (relative to average
income). Disentangling supply-side responses vs. rent-seeking responses is
particularly difficult.

3. Behavioral Responses to the 2013 Tax Reform
In this section, we analyze the behavioral responses to the 2013 tax increase.
Our basic empirical strategy is to analyze top 1% income earners (the treatment
group most affected by the reform). We will also consider two control groups: the
next 4% (top 5% excluding the top 1% which we call the top 5-1%) and the
bottom half of the top decile (top 10% excluding the top 5% which we call the top
10-5%). These two control groups are much less affected by the 2013 tax
increase. The top 10-5% group, comprised of families with pre-tax gross incomes
between $120,000 and $170,000 in 2013, is essentially unaffected by the 2013
tax reform. The top 5-1%, comprised of families with incomes between $170,000
and $400,000 in 2013, is affected by only a small fraction of the 2013 tax
increases.12

12

Top 5-1% are unaffected by the top individual income tax rate increase. As over 90%
of the incomes of the top 5-1% is from labor (wages and salaries, pensions, and selfemployment business income, see Piketty and Saez [2003] series), only the modest
0.9% ACA surtax rate on labor income applies to the vast majority of their income.

14

The simplest and most transparent way to represent the evolution of the
incomes in these groups is to look at the share of total income accruing to each
of these groups using the Piketty and Saez (2003) series, updated to 2015. Top
income shares show how the incomes of these groups evolve relative to the
average income in the economy, hence controlling for overall economic growth,
nominal changes, and population growth. Groups are defined relative to the total
number of US families (including non-filers). Income is defined as gross income
reported on tax returns including realized capital gains and excluding government
transfers (such as social security benefits and unemployment insurance). These
top income shares can be computed with micro-level tax return data (publicly
available up to tax year 2010) but also with much simpler tabulations by size of
income published by the Statistics of Income division of the IRS in a timely
fashion and available up to tax year 2015 (US Treasury Department, Statistics of
Income, annual publication). Feenberg and Poterba (1996) pioneered the use of
top income shares to analyze the effects of taxes on top reported incomes. Saez
(2004) and Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz (2012) showed how to use top shares to
estimate behavioral elasticities.
Figure 1 depicts the share of income earned by the top 1% of families
series (in black triangles on the left y-axis scale) and the top marginal tax rates
(on the right y-axis scale) from 1962 to 2015. We focus on a fairly long period
from 1962 to 2015 so as to give historical perspective. As we shall see, this chart
contains valuable information on responses of top income earners to tax rates.
The top marginal tax rate for the federal individual income tax for ordinary income
is depicted in solid line. This ordinary top income tax rate incorporates the
uncapped payroll tax rate (equal to 2.9% of earnings starting in 1994) and the
ACA surtax starting in 2013 (and described earlier). We include only 50% of the
uncapped payroll tax rate as it applies only to earnings, which represent about
half of incomes reported by the top 1% (Piketty and Saez [2003]). We include
only 80% of the ACA surtax (as the ACA surtax does not apply to about 20% of
incomes reported by the top 1%).

15

3.1 Short-term responses evidence
Overall income response: Let us start with the short-run response to the 2013 tax
increase. The top 1% income share depicted in Figure 1 displays a clear spike in
2012. The top 1% income share surges by 3.2 points from 19.6% in 2011 to
22.8% in 2012. This is actually the largest year-to-year increase since 1986 when
the top 1% income share also increased by 3.2 points. As we discuss below in
detail, the 1986 spike was also tax reform driven. This spike in 2012 is followed
by a trough in 2013 when the top 1% falls by 2.8 points down to 20.0%. This fall
is as large as the fall from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. The top 1%
also fell sharply (by 3.3 points) in the recession of 2001 when the stock market
crashed. There was another sharp fall in 1987, which is also tax reform driven.
Hence, the historical perspective since 1962 provided by Figure 1 shows a clear
extraordinary spike in 2012 followed by a trough in 2013. As both 2012 and 2013
were similar in terms of macro-economic growth (moderate growth rates in both
years) and stock market gains (strong gains in both years), the spike and trough
cannot be explained by macro-economic conditions. Hence, we can with great
confidence conclude that the spike in 2012 and trough in 2013 are due to the
2013 tax reform. The most plausible explanation is income retiming. The
magnitude of the spike and trough in 2012-3 is slightly lower than the spike and
trough of 1986-7 which was due entirely to realized capital gains retiming as the
tax rate on realized capital gains increased by 8 points from 20% to 28% while
the ordinary income tax rate was actually cut substantially (from 50% to 28%) as
shown in Figure 1.13 The magnitude of the spike and trough in 2012-3 is much
larger than the spike and trough in 1992-3. The 1992 reform did not affect the tax
rate on realized capital gains and hence retiming was due only to ordinary
income (Goolsbee [2000] showed a strong retiming response for executive stockoptions). These comparisons with earlier reforms suggest that realized capital

13

Auerbach (1988) analyzes in detail the realized capital gains response to the Tax
Reform Act of 1986.

16

gains must be a very significant driver of the 2013 tax reform response, a point
we discuss in detail below.
Figure 2 offers additional evidence by depicting the top 5-1% and top 105% income shares. We have not repeated the top marginal tax rates from Figure
1 to avoid cluttering the figure. For these control groups (or quasi-control group in
the case of the top 5-1%), there is no evidence at all of a spike in 2012 followed
by a through in 2013. If anything, there is a slight trough in 2012 due to the fact
that top 1% incomes surged, and made the denominator slightly and abnormally
larger in that case, depressing the income shares for groups below the top 1%.
Note that the absence of short-term retiming in groups below the top 1% was
also true for earlier tax reforms like the 1986 tax reform and the 1993 tax reform.
Hence, examination of these control groups further reinforces our confidence that
the spike and trough in 2012-3 for the top 1% were indeed tax driven.
Figure 3 breaks down the top 1% into the top 0.1% and the next 0.9% (top
1-0.1%). The top 0.1% is comprised of families with annual incomes over $2m in
2015. The next 0.9% is comprised of families with annual incomes between
$450,000 and $2m in 2015. The top 0.1% income share is depicted in black
triangles while the next 0.9% income share is depicted in full circles. The most
interesting feature of this chart is that the 2012-3 spike-trough phenomenon is
magnified for the top 0.1% and correspondingly much weaker for the next 0.9%.
Even though the income shares for the two groups are of comparable magnitude
in recent years (around 10% of total income), the increase from 2011 to 2012 is
only .7 points for the top 1-.1% while it is 2.4 points for the top .1%, i.e., 3.5 times
larger. Similarly, the fall in top income shares from 2012 to 2013 is also 3.5 times
larger for the top 0.1% than for the next 0.9%. The same differences in the
magnitude of responses also arose in the retiming responses following the 1986
tax reform and the 1993 tax reform. In both of these cases, the spike-trough
responses are about 3 times larger for the top 0.1% than for the next 0.9%. This
suggests that very top income earners have much more ability to avoid taxes by
retiming income than high (but not super high) income earners. Below, we will

17

estimate the corresponding behavioral elasticities by income groups to quantify
these qualitative findings.
Anatomy of the response: Figure 4 depicts the share of income earned by the top
0.1% of families and its decomposition. Panel A considers income including
realized capital gains and decomposes it into (a) realized capital gains, (b)
income excluding realized capital gains. Panel B considers income excluding
realized capital gains and decomposes it into (a) salaries (includes all wages and
salaries and pensions), (b) business income (includes profits from sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations), (c) capital income excluding
dividends (includes interest, rents and royalties, and estate and trust income), (d)
dividends. Note that the share of income excluding capital gains in Panel A is
lower than the total income share excluding capital gains in Panel B. This is
because tax filers are ranked by income including realized capital gains in Panel
A while they are ranked by income excluding realized capital gains in Panel B.
We focus on the top 0.1% because Figure 3 showed that the bulk of the
short-term retiming response was concentrated within that group, making the
compositional analysis easier to see. Confirming our earlier conjecture, Panel A
shows that it is indeed the case that the majority of the spike-trough response in
2012-3 is due to the realized capital gain component. This implies that income
components (other than realized capital gains) have also responded to the 2013
tax reform albeit in a muted way. Panel B shows that 3 out of the 4 components
depicted, namely wages and salaries, business income, and dividends have
responded to the tax reform, while the other capital income component does not
show any response. The business income response is fairly modest. The salaries
response is somewhat stronger and clearly visible in Figure 4, Panel B. This
suggests that stock-options were not very aggressively used to retime income. It
is interesting to note that the response of salaries is somewhat weaker around
the 2013 reform than around the 1993 reform. Panel B shows that dividend
income has responded very strongly to the tax change. The response of dividend
income is actually close in relative magnitude to the response of realized capital

18

gains. We suspect that the response of dividend income is due to special
onetime dividends paid out specifically to game the 2013 tax reform. Publicly
traded firms can sometimes use such special dividends as they did around the
2003 dividend tax cut (Chetty and Saez, 2005). Indeed, using data on publicly
traded firms, Perez Cavazos and Silva (2015) show that firms retimed dividend
payments to take advantage of the tax differential. Private equity funds have also
been known for extracting cash from the privately held corporations they control
by generating special dividend payments (see e.g., Appelbaum and Batt, 2014).
It is conceivable that private equity funds used special dividends to time the
reform as well. Interestingly, dividend income did not respond to the 1993 tax
reform, even though the tax incentive to do so was almost the same. However, in
1992-3, dividend distributions were a clearly dominated form of profit distribution
relative to retaining profits and realizing capital gains. This shows that tax
avoidance techniques, even as simple as retiming, evolve over time depending
on the overall tax system leading to different magnitudes of responses.
One issue when considering specific income components in Figure 4
Panel B is that families are ranked by total income. Hence, if one component
responds strongly (such as dividends), it might tilt the composition of top income
earners toward dividend income (and away from other components), hereby
magnifying the response of dividends and depressing the response of other
components. This issue can be addressed by looking separately at each income
component. We do so for wage income as Social Security Administration
produces a very valuable and timely annual tabulation of individual wage income
(from forms W2) starting with year 1990.14
Using these wage income statistics, Figure 5 depicts the share of wage
income earned by the top 0.1% individuals (ranked by wage income relative to
the potential population of employees) since 1990.15 Wage income is defined as

14

This tabulation is posted online at https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2014
The top 0.1% is relative to the total potential population of employees defined as 85%
of the full US population aged 20-64. We choose a fixed fraction of the working age
population to incorporate the effects of fluctuations in employment in our wage income
concentration series. In year 2000, when the unemployment rate is slightly below 4%,
15

19

W2 wage income (wages, salaries, and tips) inclusive of elective retirement
contributions (such as 401(k) contributions). Wage income also includes
bonuses, and profits from exercised stock-options.
The pattern of the top 0.1% wage income share in Figure 5 is actually very
similar to the pattern of the top 0.1% wage income component from Figure 4,
Panel B. This shows that the re-ranking issue is not a major issue (a point we
confirm with our elasticity estimates below). In particular, Figure 5 shows a clear
spike in the top 0.1% wage income share in 2012 followed by a trough in 2013.
The magnitude of the spike is clearly more modest than for overall income,
confirming the fact that wage income responds less than overall income (and
particularly overall income including realized capital gains). Figure 5 also shows
a very clear spike as well in 1992 in anticipation of the 1993 top tax rate increase.
Elasticity estimates: Next, we quantify the size of the behavioral retiming
response in the short-run by estimating the elasticity of income with respect to
the net-of-tax rate. The net-of-tax rate is defined as one minus the marginal tax
rate. This elasticity measures the percent change in reported income when the
net-of-tax rate increases by 1 percent. The short-term elasticity measures the
change in incomes in 2013 vs. 2012 that is driven by the tax change. The shortterm elasticity estimate eS can be estimated as follows:
eS= (log sh2013 – log sh2012)/(log(1-MTR2013)-log(1-MTR2012)), (1)
where sht denotes the share of income going to the top 1% in year t, MTRt
denotes the marginal tax rate faced by the top 1% in year t. Equation (1) provides
an unbiased estimate of eS if, absent the tax change, the share of income going
to the top 1% would have stayed constant from year 2012 to year 2013. Under
this key identification assumption, the estimate eS picks up the log change in
the ratio of the employed population (full-time plus part-time employees in National
Accounts series) to the population 20-64 reaches its highest level at 82.4%. Hence, 85%
of the population aged 20-64 can be seen as a reasonable benchmark for the maximum
potential population of employees.

20

income triggered by the log change in the net-of-tax rate. Using shares of
income--as opposed to real incomes—naturally controls for overall economic
growth and is reasonable as long as the tax responses have minimal impact on
aggregate incomes (i.e., does not affect the denominator of the income share).
This is a valid approximation in our case where the top 1% captures only about
20% of total income. 16 Repeated cross sectional comparisons provide the
simplest and most transparent elasticity estimates. Saez (2004) and Saez,
Slemrod, and Giertz (2010) discuss in detail their properties.
Intuitively, behavioral responses to taxation such as tax avoidance,
retiming, or real responses are going to affect the cross-sectional distribution of
income across years, and in particular how individuals affected by the reform (the
top 1% for the 2012-3 reform) do relative to the rest (bottom 99%). Analyzing top
income shares built from repeated cross sections of annual income is the most
transparent way to show how top incomes do relative to economy wide average
incomes. Importantly, repeated cross-sectional analysis is robust to the presence
of year-to-year income mobility within individuals. Longitudinal analysis using
panel data can be useful to refine the analysis of retiming as we discuss in
conclusion.
Is the identification assumption of stability of top income shares (absent
the reform) satisfactory? To a first approximation it is as the year-to-year change
from 2012 to 2013 of 3 points is much larger than in other years. Yet, there is
obviously both a long-term upward trend in top 1% income shares from less than
10% in the late 1970s to over 20% in recent years. This means that the top 1%
income share has increased on average by .32 points per year from 1978 (the
year before the top 1% income share starts to increase) to 2011 (the last year
before the 2013 tax change has an impact). There is also a medium-term upward
trend in the top 1% income shares due to the recovery from the sharp drop
during the Great Recession. From 2009 to 2011, the top 1% increased by .75
16

An alternative would be to use as denominator the share of income going to the
bottom 99% which would purge the denominator of tax effects. We stick to using top
income shares for simplicity.

21

points per year. Hence, it is conceivable that, absent the reform, the top 1%
income share would have increased from 2012 to 2013, because of its secular
trend upward and also because of the medium-term recovery from the Great
Recession. This increase goes against the behavioral response due to retiming
and hence leads to downward bias in our estimate of eS from equation (1). If we
think that (log) top income shares would have increased by Δlog sh absent the
reform then the elasticity estimate for eS would be:
eS= (log sh2013 – log sh2012 − Δlog sh)/(log(1-MTR2013)-log(1-MTR2012)).

(2)

In our estimates of eS, we consider two alternative assumptions for Δlog sh. First,
we assume that Δlog sh is equal to the long-term secular trend from 1978 to
2011. Second, we assume that Δlog sh is equal to the medium-term recovery
trend from 2009 to 2011. In both cases, Δlog sh is small relative to the actual log
change in top income shares (log sh2013 – log sh2012) so that the resulting
elasticity estimates are not very sensitive to our identification assumption. In any
case, the benchmark assumption Δlog sh=0 implicit in equation (1) is a
conservative assumption and hence our benchmark elasticity estimate can be
seen as a lower bound conservative estimate. The key point is that this lower
bound estimate is large for top income groups and specific income components
showing that retiming is a significant tax avoidance avenue in the short-run.
Table 2 presents formal estimates of the short-run elasticity eS for various income
groups, and various specific income components under various identification
assumptions. Each of the four columns considers a specific income group: (1)
top 1%, (2) top 1-.1% (top 1% excluding the top .1%), (3) top .1%, (4) top .01%.
Panel A describes the computations in detail for the elasticity of total income
including capital gains with respect to the net-of-tax rate. The elasticity is
estimated as the ratio of the log-change in top income shares from 2012 to 2013
to the log-change in net-of-tax rates as in equation (1). Net-of-tax rates are
computed from Table 1.

The benchmark estimates of Panel A assume no
22

change in top income shares absent the tax reform. Panel B presents two
alternative identification assumptions. The first row of Panel B assumes that top
income shares would have increased as the secular long-term average from
1978 to 2011. The second row of Panel B assumes that top income shares would
have increased as the medium-term post Great Recession increase from 2009 to
2011.
In Panel C, we compute elasticity estimates for specific income
components. The elasticities are defined again using equation (1) but sht is now
defined as the ratio of the specific income component earned by the top income
group to total income economy wide in year t. For example, for realized capital
gains, sht is defined at realized capital gains earned by the top 1% (ranked by
total income) divided by total income in the economy in year t. The advantage of
dividing by total income is that the elasticity captures the growth in volume of the
specific income component. For example, aggregate realized capital gains are
much larger in 2012 than in 2013 because 80% of capital gains are reported by
the top 1%. Hence, dividing by total income (instead of total realized capital
gains) is more appropriate.
Paralleling the evidence from Figure 4, Panel C displays elasticities for
specific income components. The first row repeats the total income with capital
gains from Panel A. The second and third row split total income into realized
capital gains and income excluding realized capital gains as in Figure 4, Panel A.
The next rows split income excluding realized capital gains into: wages and
salaries, business income, dividends, and other capital income (interest, rents,
royalties, and estate and trust income) as in Figure 4, Panel B.
Panel D computes elasticities around earlier reforms. The first row
considers realized capital gains around the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which
increased the capital gains tax rate from 20 to 28%. The remaining rows focus on
the 1993 top tax rate increase from 31% to 39.6% considering first overall
income excluding capital gains and next wages and salaries specifically. Three
findings stand out of Table 2.

23

First, as suggested by the graphical analysis, Panel A shows that the
short-run elasticities are large especially for very top income groups. The
elasticity for the top 1% is 1.16. The elasticity for the top 1-.1% is much lower at
0.45, and correspondingly, the elasticity for the top .1% is higher at 1.84. The
elasticity for the top .01% is even higher at 2.18. As we discussed, these
elasticities are conservative as they assume that top income shares would have
stayed constant absent the reform. Panel B shows that we obtain somewhat
higher elasticities when assuming that top income shares would have kept
growing absent the reform. The important point however is that for the
reasonable assumptions in Panel B, the change in the size of the elasticity
estimates is fairly small relative to the size of the baseline estimates. The top 1%
elasticity grows from 1.16 in our baseline, to 1.30 if we assume that top income
shares would have grown as in their long-term trend from 1978 to 2011. The
elasticity estimate grows to 1.49 if we assume that top income shares would
have grown as in their medium-term trend post-Great Recession from 2009 to
2011. Hence, the evidence is very compelling that the short-run elasticity is large,
in excess of one and very likely below 1.5 for the top 1% as a whole.
Second, Panel C confirms that there is very wide variation in the shortterm elasticity estimates across different income components, as we saw in
Figure 4. Realized capital gains are extremely elastic with an estimated elasticity
above 3 (for the top 1% as a whole). Even for the top 1-.1%, the elasticity is
almost 2. Income excluding realized capital gains is correspondingly less elastic
but it still displays a sizeable short-term elasticity of .73 for the top 1%, and is
also higher for the very top groups (1.19 for the top .1%). Within income
excluding realized capital gains, there is also significant heterogeneity in
responses. Wages and salaries are slightly less elastic, with a top 1% elasticity of
.44. The wages and salaries elasticities for the top 1-.1% is small at .13. The
elasticities of wages and salaries for the very top groups .1% and .01% are pretty
high, in excess of one. This is consistent with the scenario whereby only very
high salaried individuals are able to retime their earnings, perhaps through stockoption exercises. We also use Social Security Administration data on wage

24

income (depicted in Figure 5) to compute elasticities of wage earnings using
solely the wage income distribution at the bottom of Panel C. These elasticities
computed using wage income are actually very close to the elasticities computed
using the wage income component of total income. This shows that composition
effects due to differential responses of different income components have only a
minor impact on our estimates, and hence that our basic approach using income
components of total income is acceptable.
Business income is only moderately elastic and not more elastic at the
very top than in the top 1-.1%. Ordinary capital income is quite elastic with the
response concentrated in the dividend income category and low elasticities for
other forms of ordinary capital income (which include interest, rents, royalties,
and estate and trust income). Dividend income is about as elastic as realized
capital gains, slightly less so in the top 1-.1% and even more so in the top .1%
and top .01%. This suggests that corporations were able to pay out extraordinary
dividends in 2012 to take advantage of the low rate, particularly corporations
owned by very high income earners.
Third, it is interesting to contrast the elasticity estimates for 2012-3 with
the elasticity estimates for earlier reforms presented in Panel D. Realized capital
gains in 1986 displayed an enormous elasticity around 10, for all groups within
the top 1%. Hence, the 1986 response of realized capital gains was much larger.
The enormous response of realized capital gains to the 1986 tax reform is well
known “the stuff of legend” as Slemrod (1996) emphatically wrote. The larger
elasticity in 1986 could be due to longer advance notice relative to the 2013 tax
increase. 17 The elasticity of income excluding capital gains around the 1992
reform was smaller than in the 2012 reform: 0.32 in 1992-3 vs. 0.73 in 2012-3.
However, the wages and salaries elasticity was comparable (0.32 in 1992-3 vs.
0.44 in 2012-3) across reforms. The response of salaries at the very top (top
.01%) was actually even higher in 1992 than in 2012. Dividends in 1992-3 were
totally unresponsive to the tax reform in sharp contrast with 2012-3. It is possible
17

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was formally enacted on October 22, 1986 but it had
passed the House on December 1985 and the Senate in June 1986 so that its broad
features were known many months in advance.

25

that the 2003 dividend tax cut taught companies to use special dividends for tax
avoidance (Chetty and Saez [2005]) and that the development of private equity
has also increased the volume of strategic dividend payments that can also be
timed for tax avoidance (see Appelbaum and Batt [2014] for a detailed discussion
of the use of special dividends payments from companies controlled by private
equity funds).
3.2 Medium-term responses evidence
Next, we turn to the estimation of medium-run responses where we compare
year 2011, the latest year unaffected by the 2013 tax reform and year 2015, the
third year post-reform and the most recent year currently available.18
Looking more broadly in Figure 1 at the evolution of the top 1% after the
tax reform, we can see that the top 1% income share resumes its upward trend
after 2013. In particular, the top 1% income share rebounds strongly from 20% in
2013 to 21.4% in 2014. By 2015, the top 1% income share is 22.0% and is
actually close to its 2012 peak level of 22.8%. This implies that the 2013 reform
depressed top income shares only temporarily in 2013 (as part of the retiming
response discussed above). Therefore, in the medium-term, the response to the
tax reform appears to be much smaller. Figure 3, which splits the top 1% income
share into the top .1% income share and the next .9% (top 1-.1%) income share,
shows similar evidence. Figure 4 also shows that realized capital gains resume
their upward trend after 2013.
Following our earlier discussion, we can estimate the medium-term
elasticity eM as follows:
eM= (log sh2015 – log sh2011 - Δlog sh)/(log(1-MTR2015)-log(1-MTR2011)),
18

(3)

Importantly, 2015 estimates are extrapolated based on preliminary tabulations posted
by the Statistics of Income division of the IRS for tax returns processed up to late-May
2016 (online at https://www.irs.gov/uac/filing-season-statistics). Final statistics for 2015
based on all returns are not available until August 2017. Estimates from prior years show
however that preliminary statistics are generally very close to final statistics (Saez, 2008
and updates).

26

where sht is the top income share in year t and MTRt the marginal tax rate for the
top income group in year t and Δlog sh is the counterfactual log change in top
income shares from 2011 to 2015, if the 2013 tax reform had not taken place.
The difficulty is to determine what the appropriate counterfactual Δlog sh should
be. The medium-term elasticity spans 4 years while the short-term elasticity
estimated in the previous section spanned only 1 year. Hence, the counterfactual
assumption has 4 times as much impact for the medium-term elasticity than for
the short-run elasticity. This makes the identification of the medium-run elasticity
much more challenging.
Our earlier assumption of constant top income shares from 2011 to 2015
absent the reform would generate negative elasticities as top income shares
actually grow from 2011 to 2015. Hence, this is not a realistic assumption.
Absent the reform, top income shares would clearly have grown as well, but by
how much? We consider again two possible assumptions, illustrated in Figure 6,
Panel A. The figure depicts the share of income earned by the top 1% of families
in black triangles. The figure also depicts two counterfactual trends for the top
1% income shares. First, the figure depicts (in solid circles) the long-run straightline upward trend from 1978 to 2011. 1978 marks the beginning of the long-term
increase in the top 1% income share. 2011 is the last year not affected by the
2013 tax reform. Second, the figure depicts (in diamonds) the medium-run
straight-line extrapolated linearly from the evolution of the top 1% income share
from 2009 to 2011 after the Great Recession. We use these two counterfactuals
in the estimation of the behavioral elasticity of income with respect to the net-oftax rate following the 2013 tax reform.
Examining Figure 6, Panel A, the more aggressive medium-term upward
trend appears to be the more reasonable counterfactual as top income shares
have increased sharply after the earlier (although milder) recessions of 1992 and
2001. Indeed, following the previous recessions of 1992 and 2001, the path of
recovery of the top 1% income share was very close to the linear extrapolation of
the first two years of recovery (1992 to 1994 and 2002 to 2004) as depicted in

27

Figure 6 for comparison purposes. In contrast the long-term secular trend from
1978 to 2011 significantly undershoots the recovery of the top 1% income share
following recessions. Therefore, we will use in our benchmark estimates the
counterfactual based on the 2009-2011 recovery path.
Panel B of Figure 6 zooms in on the recent period 2002-2015 and
illustrates graphically the estimation of the short-term elasticity eS comparing
2012 and 2013 income shares, and the medium-run elasticity eM comparing 2011
and 2015 (relative to the counterfactual trend post Great Recession 2009-2011)
as we shall discuss in detail in Table 3.
It should be noted that there remains much uncertainty about what the
path of top income shares recovery would have been absent the tax increase. In
particular, the counterfactual path of recovery of the top 1% income share is
slower than in the earlier recessions: although the top 1% income share
increased sharply from 2009 to 2010, it actually decreased slightly from 2010 to
2011 (even though 2011 is not affected by the 2013 tax reform). In the previous
recessions, the growth in the top 1% income share was smoother and more
closely aligned with a straight line extrapolating after the first two years of
recovery, as depicted in Figure 6. This implies that there are larger “confidence
intervals” around our medium-run estimates (than around our short-run estimates
described in the previous section).
Table 3 presents the medium-run elasticity estimates eM comparing 2011
and 2015. Each of the four columns considers a specific income group: (1) top
1%, (2) top 1-.1% (top 1% excluding the top .1%), (3) top .1%, (4) top .01%.
Panel A describes the computations in detail for the elasticity of total income
including capital gains with respect to the net-of-tax rate. The elasticity is
estimated using equation (2) as the ratio of the log-change in top income shares
from 2011 to 2015 (minus the counterfactual change Δlog sh) to the log-change
in net-of-tax rates (from Table 1). The numerator of the elasticity eM is illustrated
in Figure 6, Panel B as the difference in 2015 between the actual top income
share and the counterfactual income share. The benchmark estimates of Panel A
assume that, absent the tax change, top income shares would have increased at

28

the same rate as the medium-term post Great Recession increase from 2009 to
2011 (diamond series in Figure 6). Panel B1 repeats the benchmark estimates in
the first row and presents two alternative identification assumptions in rows 2 and
3. The second row of Panel B1 assumes that top income shares would have
increased as the secular long-term average from 1978 to 2011 (solid circles
series in Figure 6). The third row of Panel B1 assumes that top income shares
would have stayed constant. Panel B2 repeats Panel B1 but for income
excluding realized capital gains (instead of income including capital gains). Three
important findings should be noted.
First and most important, our benchmark estimates show uniformly small
medium-term elasticities for all income groups (between .1 and .3). For the top
1%, we obtain a medium-term elasticity eM=.26. In other words, top income
shares have increased from 2011 to 2015 at an annual rate only very slightly
lower than from 2009 to 2011, the first two years of post-Great Recession
recovery. In Figure 6, Panel B, in 2015, the counterfactual series in diamonds is
only very slightly higher than the actual series in solid black triangles.
Second, Panel B confirms that the estimates are quite sensitive to our
identification assumption. If we use the 1978-2011 trend to construct the
counterfactual, then the elasticities become negative (-0.44 for the top 1%
income group). If we assume a flat top income share path for the counterfactual,
the elasticities become large negatives (-1.0 for the top 1% income group).
Conversely, if we had chosen a more aggressive path of recovery for the top 1%
than the 2009-2011 experience, the estimated elasticity would have been larger.
Obtaining a large elasticity (equal to one or above) however would have required
a very aggressive path of growth for the top 1%, which is not very realistic in light
of the moderate growth path of top income shares from 2009 to 2011. This
highlights, however, that our benchmark estimates have large implicit
“confidence intervals”. Panel B2 show that we obtain quite similar results when
we consider income excluding capital gains. Our benchmark estimates display
fairly small elasticities (around .3). These elasticities become negative as well if

29

we make less aggressive identification assumptions on the path of top 1%
incomes.
The existing literature has often used lower income groups as controls to
analyze the effects of top tax rates on reported top incomes (see the pioneering
studies by Lindsey [1987] and Feldstein [1995]). Figure 2 shows the issue with
this approach. For the 2013 reform, the top 5-1% and top 10-5% which are high
(but not super high) may a-priori look like good control groups. Indeed, their
income shares are hardly affected by the 2013 tax reform and stay almost flat in
the medium-term from 2011 to 2015: the top 5-1% share increases very slightly
from 16.2% to 16.5% while the top 10-5% share decreases very slightly from
12.2% to 11.9%. Hence, using these groups as controls would amount to
assuming that, absent the 2013 tax reform, the top income share for the
treatment group (the top 1%) would also have stayed constant. However, as we
have just seen, this would produce large negative elasticities. Taking a longerterm perspective, Figure 2 shows that assuming a parallel trend between the top
1% treatment group and the top 5-1% and top 10-5% control groups is not a
tenable assumption: The top 1% income share displays a much stronger upward
long-term trend than the rest of the top decile. The top 1% income share also
falls more during recessions and rebounds more strongly after recessions that
the control groups. Hence, it is almost certain that, even absent the 2013 tax
reform, the top 1% would have grown faster than the control groups from 2011 to
2015. The bottom line is that using high (but not super high) income groups as
controls is not a sound assumption for estimating the behavioral responses of
high income taxpayers.
Another approach could be to use variation in tax rates changes within the
top 1% to identify tax rate effects. Yet, there are also issues with such an
approach.

30

First, taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) are less
affected by the 2013 tax reform.19 However, AMT taxpayers within the top 1% are
unlikely to be a good control group because they tend to be in the bottom part of
the top 1% (see Table 3.1 in US Treasury Department, IRS, Statistics of Income,
Publication 1304). We have seen clearly that the tax response is much stronger
in the top .1% than in the next .9%. Hence, AMT taxpayers are likely to be less
responsive to tax changes than the top 1% as a whole and hence unlikely to be a
good control group.
Second, some income components are less affected by the 2013 tax
reform than others. For example, S-corporation active profits or pensions are not
affected by the Health care surtax. However, as we have seen in Table 2, there
is great heterogeneity in elasticities across income groups. Hence, exploiting
variation in tax rate changes across income groups is also unlikely to provide
compelling identification.
Third, there are many aspects of the tax system that generate local
variation in marginal tax rates. For example, the 2013 tax reform reintroduced the
phasing-out of exemptions, which increases marginal tax rates in a specific range
of income (between $300,000 and $425,000 of AGI for married joint filers for
example). However, the literature has shown that taxpayers are much less
responsive to local and less salient changes in the tax system (such as a phaseout for example) than the much more visible top tax rates.20 This could be due to
fixed costs required to respond to tax changes (it is not worth re-optimizing if the
stakes are small) or information issues (individuals or their tax accountants
19

Specifically, AMT taxpayers are equally affected by the Health care surtax. They also
face the higher 20% tax rate on realized capital gains and dividends but they do not face
the higher 39.6% tax rate on ordinary income. The marginal tax rate of AMT taxpayers is
also affected by the phasing-out provisions of the AMT exemptions (which increases the
AMT marginal tax rate from 28% to 35% for ordinary income and from 20% to 25% for
dividends and realized capital gains).
20
Chetty et al. (2011) show that estimated elasticities around large kink points where the
marginal tax rate jumps up using bunching methods are much larger than around small
kink points. Saez, Slemrod, Giertz (2012) obtain much smaller elasticities when they use
all sources of variation in marginal tax rates (instead of just large tax reforms) in microeconometric regressions using US panel tax data for years 1991 to 1997 (see their
Table 2, p. 24, last two rows).

31

ignore small aspects of the tax code and concentrate on the main features only).
The bottom line is that taxpayers pretty much ignore small changes to focus on
the broad features on the tax system. Hence, the elasticity obtained from using
local and less salient changes is unlikely to be the relevant one for evaluating the
effects of the main features of the 2013 tax change. Note also that for short-term
retiming, the precise details of the tax reform were not known before early 2013.
As a result, short-term retiming had to be based by necessity only on the
expected broad features of the tax change.
Therefore, based on these three main points, it is unlikely that a more
micro-approach within the top 1% will yield more convincing estimates than the
simpler and transparent approach proposed in this paper. In the conclusion, we
will discuss various avenues for further refining the analysis with individual level
micro-data.
3.3 Evidence from Charitable Giving
The analysis of charitable giving behavior of top income earners can cast
additional useful light on behavioral responses to taxation. The literature has
found significant responses of charitable giving to tax rates, especially in the
short-run. 21 Charitable giving responses to taxation have traditionally been
studied separately from responses to overall reported income. However, studying
them together is fruitful for two main reasons. First, charitable giving is an
important part of how the rich use their incomes. Indeed, the fraction of income
given to charity increases with income and has reached about 10% of total
income at the very top of the income distribution in recent years (see the IRS
statistics on the top 400 income earners, U.S Treasury, IRS, 2015). Top 1%
income earners have given about 3-4% of their income to charity in recent years.
Therefore, charitable giving is potentially a useful proxy for the real economic
21

Clotfelter (1985) provides an earlier survey of the literature on charitable giving and
taxation. Landais and Fack (2016) provide a more recent survey emphasizing the
historical perspective. See Auten, Sieg, and Clotfelter (2002) and Bakija and Heim
(2011) for studies exploiting recent US tax reforms.

32

incomes of top income taxpayers. If incomes at the top increase (for tax
unrelated reasons), charitable giving should increase as well. Second, the tax
incentives for charitable giving go in the opposite direction of the tax incentives
for reporting income. This is because charitable giving can be deducted from
income to reduce the amount of tax paid. As a result, giving $1 to charity saves
$1 times the marginal tax rate (MTR) and hence really costs the taxpayer $1MTR. Therefore, the net-of-tax rate $1-MTR is effectively the price of charitable
giving. Hence, if the marginal tax rate on top earners increases, we should see
their reported income decrease, but we should also see their charitable giving
increase. Therefore, the asymmetry in responses to taxes of charitable giving vs.
overall income offers a unique opportunity to disentangle tax-induced changes
from non-tax-induced changes.
Figure 7 depicts average charitable giving of top 1% income earners
(normalized by average income per family economy wide) in empty diamonds on
the left y-axis. It also depicts the top 1% income share on the right y-axis for
comparison purposes. The normalization of charitable giving is made so that the
two series are directly comparable as the top 1% income share is defined as
average income of the top 1% income earners divided by average income per
family economy wide. Two interesting broad points can be made.
First, charitable giving of the top 1% and the incomes of the top 1% have
followed remarkably parallel paths both in the long-run from 1962 to 2014 and in
the short-run around the 2013 tax reform. We will discuss the long-run parallel
paths in detail in the next sub-section. Focusing on the period around the 2012
tax reform, we can see that charitable giving of the top 1% falls sharply during
the Great recession from 2007 to 2009 and then starts recovering from 2009 to
2011, following almost exactly the same path as the top 1% income share. This
short-run parallelism suggests that, absent a tax change, charitable giving of the
top 1% is actually a good proxy for the evolution of top 1% incomes. Strikingly
and unexpectedly based on prior work, charitable giving also spikes in 2012 and
then falls in 2013, again following almost exactly the path of top 1% income. We
discussed in great detail above how top 1% income earners retimed their income

33

from 2013 to 2012. Figure 7 shows that they correspondingly retimed their
charitable giving from 2013 to 2012 even though this strategy is tax dominated.
They could have saved $4.6 per $100 of charitable giving by postponing their
charitable giving into 2013 (and benefit from the higher marginal tax rate of
39.6% in 2013 instead of 35% in 2012). This tax avoiding strategy should have
been easy to carry out as incomes were already realized (and hence no liquidity
or credit constraints issues were present). This implies that charitable giving of
top earners was inelastic around the 2013 tax reform in the short-run, in contrast
to what was expected based on the earlier literature. Interestingly, the spike in
2012 is hardly visible for the top 1-.1% group and correspondingly more
pronounced for the top .1%. This suggests that, for charitable giving, the bottom
of the top 1% might be more tax strategic than the very top, in sharp contrast to
what we saw for income.
Second and related, Figure 7 shows evidence of tax induced behavioral
responses of charitable giving around earlier tax reform episodes (recall that
Figure 1 provides the exact evolution of top marginal tax rates). In 1982, the top
tax rate on ordinary income went down from 69.1% to 50%. The top 1% income
share increases in 1982 (a fact first documented by Lindsey [1987]). However,
charitable giving is slightly higher in 1981 and slightly depressed in 1982,
suggesting some retiming response. More saliently, charitable giving was
substantially higher in 1985 and 1986, the two last years with 50% top marginal
tax rates, and is depressed in the following years when the top marginal tax rate
drops to 28%. In 1993, the top tax rate increased from 31% to 39.6%. The top
1% income share spikes in 1992 and is depressed in 1993. In contrast, charitable
giving is low in 1992 and much higher in 1993. This latter evidence is strikingly at
odds with the evidence from the 2013 tax reform. It is also difficult to see any
response of charitable giving to the Bush administration 2001 tax cut: charitable
giving follows income closely from 2000 to 2007 in spite of the reduction in top
tax rates in 2003. Therefore, charitable giving seems to have become less elastic
to taxes since 2000 at least in the short-run.

34

Third, in the medium run, from 2011 to 2014, it does seem that charitable
giving of the top 1% grows faster than the incomes of the top 1%: top 1% earners
gave 3.3% of their income in 2011 while they gave 3.8% of their income in 2014.
This could be evidence of a sizeable charitable giving elasticity in the mediumrun. However, for the top 1-.1%, the fraction given in 2011 is 2.74% and almost
identical to the fraction given in 2014 which is 2.78%, which would suggest that
only charitable giving of the very top is elastic in the medium-run. Alternatively, it
could be that charitable giving increases faster than incomes for top earners
when top income shares recover from a recession (as was the case from 1995 to
2000). This emphasizes again the difficulty of identifying medium-run elasticities.
3.4 Long-term link of top incomes and top tax rates
What can the 2013 tax reform teach us about the effects of top tax rates
on top incomes in the long-run, and the policy trade-offs involved? Obviously,
with data available only up to 2015, it is still too early to know. Our main
conclusion is that, in the medium-run, top incomes do not appear to be very
elastic to tax rates because top income shares have continued to rebound fairly
strongly from the Great Recession even after the tax rate increase. This finding is
consistent with the earlier findings around the 1993 tax rate increase when top
income shares also increased sharply in the second half of the 1990s.
Yet, in earlier work (Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva [2014]), we have
argued that there was a strong negative link between top marginal tax rates and
top income shares both in the US historical record since 1913 and in the
international data since the 1960s. In the United States since 1913, top income
shares and top marginal tax rates are mirror opposite images (Piketty, Saez,
Stantcheva [2014], Figure 1A). In the international data, there is a strong
correlation between the size of the cuts in top marginal income tax rates and the
size of the increase in top 1% income shares from the early 1960s to the late
2000s: Countries that cut their top tax rates a lot (such as the US or the UK)
experienced a surge in top 1% incomes shares, while countries which did not cut

35

their top tax rates much (such as Germany or Spain) did not experience a surge
in top 1% income shares (Piketty, Saez, Stantcheva [2014], Figure 3). How can
these findings be reconciled with the absence of medium-term responses to the
2013 tax increase?
Some have emphasized that the strong link between top tax rates and
pre-tax top income shares reflects mostly tax avoidance rather than changes in
the real economic incomes of top earners. Under this tax avoidance scenario,
real US top income shares were as high in the 1960s or 1970s as they are today
but a smaller fraction of top incomes was reported on tax returns in the 1960s
and 1970s than today, as taxpayers had strong incentives to use tax avoidance
to escape the very high top tax rates. The evidence shown in Figure 7 with
charitable giving casts new interesting light on this issue.
First and most importantly, the figure shows that charitable giving of the
top 1% has followed the path of top 1% incomes in the long-run. In the mid1970s, the top 1% income share was around 9%, which means that top 1%
income earners had 9 times the average income per family and top 1% income
earners gave to charitable causes on average 33% of the average income per
family economy wide. In 2014, the top 1% income share is 21.4% so that top 1%
earners now have 21.4 times the average income per family and they gave to
charitable causes about 81% of the average income per family economy wide.
Hence, the top 1% incomes and their charitable contributions have increased by
exactly the same factor 2.4 from the mid-1970s to 2014. Under the tax avoidance
scenario however, reported top income shares were low in the 1970s because of
tax avoidance but the real top income shares were as high as today. In that case,
top 1% income earners would have been able to give a lot to charity. The high
tax rates of the 1970s (relative to today) provided further incentives to give so
they should have given even more than today. 22 This prediction however is
completely at odds with the long-run findings in Figure 7. In other words, the rich
22

Charitable giving can be deducted from income only up to 50% of AGI (with stringer
limits on non-cash contributions) with carryover up to 5 years. Only a minuscule share of
top income earners hit this cap (and this is true for the full period 1962-2015). Hence,
limits to charitable deductions cannot explain the findings from Figure 7.

36

today are able to give a lot more to charity than in the 1970s even though the tax
incentive to do so is much weaker. This implies that their true incomes must also
have grown a lot.23 The remarkable long-run parallel trend between charitable
giving of the top 1% and the reported incomes of the top 1% strongly suggests
that reported incomes accurately reflect the evolution of the economic incomes of
the top 1%.24
Second, there are indeed episodes when charitable giving of the top 1%
does not follow the same path as the top 1% incomes in the short-term.
Interestingly, these episodes are related to tax changes. Most importantly,
charitable giving does not grow as much as reported income around the Tax
Reform Act of 1986. Figure 7 shows a gap arising between the two curves from
the early 1980s until about 1992. As discussed above, it has indeed been noted
abundantly in the previous literature that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 created a
shift in business profits from the corporate tax base toward the individual tax
base (see Slemrod, 1996, Auerbach and Slemrod, 1997, Gordon and Slemrod
2000, Saez, 2004, and the survey by Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz 2012). This
surge in business income from 1986 to 1988 is also clearly visible in Figure 4
Panel B described above. The fact that charitable giving does not increase much
from 1984 to 1990 while reported top incomes do, is fully consistent with the
earlier findings from the literature that income shifting played a large role in the
surge of top incomes during the Tax Reform Act episode. However, in the longrun, corporations distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or
realized capital gains (when shareholders sell their shares). Hence, a shift from
the corporate sector toward the individual sector increases business individual
income but also reduces correspondingly dividends and realized capital gains in
23

Note that if the rich were accumulating income within corporations in the 1960s and
the 1970s and had wanted to give part of this income to charity, they could have realized
income at any time (by paying out dividends or selling stock) and given the realized
income immediately to charity, at zero tax cost. Hence, accumulation within closely held
businesses does not prevent charitable giving at the individual level.
24
An alternative explanation is that the rich have become more generous over time, and
their increased generosity has moved almost in perfect tandem with their reduced tax
avoidance (and hence their reported incomes). If this alternative looks like a stretch, it is
probably because it is.

37

the long-run, and hence might not depress reported top income shares in the
long-run. Therefore, the shift in business income due to the Tax Reform Act of
1986 inflates artificially top reported incomes in the short-run but not in the longrun. Consistent with this, Figure 7 shows that charitable giving of the top 1%
catches up with reported top incomes in the 1990s.
If the surge in top incomes since the 1970s is real and if the cut in top tax
rates played a significant role in this surge, how can we explain that the 2013 top
tax rate increase (and the earlier 1993 top tax rate increase) do not seem to have
prevented top income shares from growing further? In our view, the most likely
explanation is that top tax rates are only one element determining the level of top
income shares. Certainly, the comprehensive US and international historical
record gathered in the World Top Income Database (Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez,
2011) shows that top income shares cannot stay durably high when the tax
system is very progressive (with top tax rates in excess of 60%). However, top
income shares can vary widely across countries at lower tax rates. For example,
Japan has top tax rates comparable to the US today, yet has top 1% income
shares that are only half as high (Moriguchi and Saez [2008]). Therefore, within
the range of top marginal tax rates that have existed since 1988 in the United
States, i.e., in the range of 28% to 43% (see Figure 1), top incomes do not
appear to be very sensitive to top tax rates, except through short-term tax
avoidance.25 This implies that increasing top tax rates within this range is an
efficient way to raise revenue. And it is obviously desirable if society values a
more equal distribution of economic resources. Next, we compute more precisely
the revenue consequences of the 2013 tax increase.
3.5. Revenue Effects of the 2013 Tax Increase

25

When top tax rates are very high, top incomes do not seem very responsive to tax
rates either. Figures 1 and 3 show that the Kennedy tax cuts of the early 1960s which
lowered the top tax rate from 87% to 70%, hereby more than doubling the net-of-tax rate
from 13% to 30% at the top, had no noticeable effect on the top income shares.

38

In this final section, we derive the revenue consequences of the
behavioral responses we have uncovered and we relate them to the projected
revenue increases of the tax reform absent any behavioral response. This allows
us to evaluate the efficiency costs of the tax reform. In the spirit of this paper, we
aim at providing simple computations based on the basic data we have used
rather than trying to estimate tax rates perfectly incorporating all the aspects of
the tax code using tax calculators such as TAXSIM. Hence, our computations
should be seen as an illustrative first order approximation capturing the most
important aspects of the reform and its behavioral responses.
Revenue loss due to medium-term responses: It is easy to evaluate the efficiency
costs of the 2013 tax reform following the framework laid out in Saez (2004) or
Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz (2012). Starting from a tax rate τ in the top bracket for
incomes above z*, increasing the top tax rate by dτ mechanically raises dM=N[zz*]dτ where N is the number of taxpayers in the top bracket and z the average
income in the top bracket. With an elasticity e of reported income with respect to
the net-of-tax rate, top bracket taxpayers reduce their reported income on
average by dz = - e z dτ/(1-τ), reducing tax revenue from top bracket taxpayers
by dB=-N τ dz= -N dτ e z τ/(1-τ). Hence, the total effect on tax revenue is
dT=dM+dB:
dT = dτ N [z-z*- e z τ/(1-τ) ] = dτ N [z-z*] [1- e a τ/(1-τ)],

(4)

where a=z/(z-z*) is the Pareto parameter of the income distribution in the top
bracket. Hence, equation (4) very simply shows that the fraction of the projected
mechanical revenue lost through behavioral responses is e a τ/(1-τ). For the
2013 tax change, we have e=0.26 (Table 2), a=1.5 (based on tax statistics), and
τ=.32 (Table 1), so that e a τ/(1-τ)=.19. In other words, based on our low
elasticity estimates, in the medium-run (2014 and after), only 19% of the
projected tax revenue is lost through behavioral responses.

39

Revenue loss due to short-term responses: This calculation however ignored the
short-term very large elasticity we have estimated in Table 2. How should the
short-term elasticity be incorporated in this computation? The short-term
elasticity shifts income just for one year (from 2013 to 2012). The income shifted
into 2012 still pays 2012 tax rates so the tax lost in 2013 through behavioral
responses are dBS=-N dτ dzS where dτ is the marginal tax rate difference
between 2013 and 2012 and dzS is the short-term retiming response from 2013
into 2012. Hence, we have dBS=-N dτ dzS= -N (dτ)2 eS z /(1-τ). Therefore, the
fraction of revenue lost through behavioral responses in 2012 and 2013
combined is eS a dτ/(1-τ). With dτ=.073, τ=.32 (Table 1), eS=1.16 (Table 2), and
a=1.5, this is a 19% of the projected tax revenue increase for 2013. Even though
the short-term elasticity eS is 4 times as large as the medium-term elasticity eM,
the revenue loss due to the short-term elasticity in 2013 is about the same as the
annual revenue loss in the medium-term because retimed income still pays the
2012 tax rate (which is about ¾ of the 2013 rate). This implies that the large
short-term elasticity does not fundamentally affect the efficiency costs of the
2013 tax reform.
Our medium-run elasticity estimate eM=.26 implies that the revenue
maximizing tax rate would be τ*=1/(1+a e) = 1/(1+1.5*.26)=72%. However, based
on the historical record, a tax rate that high would likely depress top incomes
much more than predicted by an elasticity of .26 (with an elasticity of .26,
increasing the top tax rate from 32% to 72% would reduce top incomes by only
21%). Therefore, in our view, there is likely a tipping point perhaps between 50%
and 60% above which marginal tax rate would have a much stronger negative
effect on top incomes. Going above this tipping point is necessary to significantly
reduce US pre-tax income concentration. As argued in Piketty, Saez, and
Stantcheva (2014), going above such a tipping point is desirable if the pre-tax
income lost by the top 1% is due to reduced rent-seeking (and not reduced labor
supply) and hence trickles down back to the bottom 99%.26

If the income lost by the top 1% is due to conventional supply side responses, nothing
trickles down to the bottom 99% and going above the revenue maximizing tax rate is

4. Conclusions and Future Work
This paper has provided preliminary evidence on behavioral responses to
taxation around the 2013 tax increase that raised top marginal tax rates on
capital income by about 9.5 points and on labor income by about 6.5 points. We
have used very simple tabulated tax data routinely produced by the Statistics of
Income division of the IRS to carry out our analysis. This has the advantages of
forcing us to focus on the big picture, of being simple and transparent, and it
illustrates the great public value of tax statistics tabulations to enlighten the tax
policy debate.
We have found that reported top 1% incomes were significantly higher in
2012 than in 2013, implying a large short-run elasticity of reported income with
respect to the net-of-tax rate in excess of one. This implies that top 1% income
earners shifted slightly over 10% of their 2013 incomes into 2012. This large
short-run elasticity is due to income retiming for tax avoidance and is particularly
high for realized capital gains and dividend income. Although the short-term
elasticity is large, the revenue consequences for 2012 and 2013 combined are
pretty modest as retimed income was still taxed at 2012 tax rates (which are
about ¾ of the 2013 tax rates). As a result, slightly less than 20% of the
mechanical projected 2013 tax revenue increase due to higher rates is lost when
adding back the taxes paid on the extra income reported in 2012.
Comparing 2011 and 2015 incomes generates a small medium-term
response to the tax increase as top income shares have resumed their upward
trend in 2015. With our preferred estimate for the medium-run elasticity of .26,
which is a moderate size elasticity, we calculate that the revenue loss (relative to
projected mechanical revenue increase) is only about 20%, making a top tax rate
increase an efficient way to raise revenue, even absent any redistributive

never desirable. However, the sense that there is a tipping point for the top marginal tax
rate, under which supply side responses are small, is at odds with the conventional
supply side response model where responses should be smooth.

41

concerns, and even if the reduced incomes at the top come from reduced
economic activity through standard supply-side responses. It is important to note
however that there is a larger confidence interval around our medium-run
elasticity estimate due to uncertainty about the correct counterfactual for top
income shares had the 2013 tax reform not happened. More broadly, it is striking
to note that the best growth years for the bottom 99% incomes since 1990 have
taken place in the mid to late 1990s and since 2013, shortly after increases in top
tax rates (Saez, 2008). Hence, the top tax rate increases of 1993 and 2013 do
not seem to have hurt overall economic growth, quite the contrary.
While simple tabulated data have allowed us to obtain some valuable
preliminary results, we want to discuss briefly in this conclusion how the use of
micro-level data could help further refine the analysis.
First, we do not think that the standard panel methodologies pioneered by
Feldstein (1995) and Gruber and Saez (2002) are useful to estimate the effects
of the 2013 tax increase. The panel methodology groups taxpayers by income
size before the reform (for example 2011) and compares income outcomes of
each group after the reform (for example 2014). In the case of the 2013 tax
reform, the treatment group is naturally the top 1% and the control group could
be the next 9%. Because of income mobility, individuals in the top 1% in 2011 will
not all be in the top 1% in 2014, so that their income rank can only fall. Hence,
their incomes will likely fall (relative to the control group whose relative ranks can
go up) leading to an upward bias in the elasticity estimation.27 Recently, Kawano,
Weber, and Whitten (2016) have analyzed the 2013 tax reform using tax data
and a panel methodology. Building upon Weber (2014), they develop a
sophisticated methodology to control for the mean reversion issue we discussed.
They obtain very small medium-run elasticity estimates, a result consistent with
our finding of small medium-run elasticity using our much simpler top income
share method.
27

Kleven and Schultz (2014) is the most compelling taxable income elasticity study
using panel techniques. The study is compelling because it can analyze large tax
changes which are not concentrated solely at the top of the distribution, so that
comparable control groups can be constructed.

42

Second however, longitudinal micro-data would allow a more direct test of
the retiming hypothesis. Do we see indeed that it is those taxpayers who report
abnormally high incomes in 2012, who then report abnormally low incomes in
2013? Using panel tax return data would allow is to zoom in on the group of
taxpayers who respond to tax avoidance through retiming, and understand more
deeply which taxpayers can retime their income.
Third, more granular analysis would help understand better the
mechanisms behind retiming. For capital income, it is possible that realized
capital gains and dividend retiming is due to corporate decisions (from private
equity for example) rather than individual shareholders decisions. For wage
income, W2 wage earnings information reports have specific information on
exercised stock options (since 2003), which would allow to analyze their
importance in the overall wage response we have documented. For business
income and using panel data, Auten, Splinter, and Nelson (2016), show that the
2013 tax reform induced a shift from passive S-corporation profits (which are
taxed as investment income by the Health care surtax) toward active Scorporation profits, which escape the Health care surtax, which is a significant
loophole in the Health care tax law. Their result emphasizes the value of using
micro-data to analyze more finely the 2013 tax reform.28

There is no information on passive vs. active S-corporation profits in the standard
Statistics of Income tabulations. Auten, Splinter, and Nelson (2016) also estimate shortterm elasticities following our simple top income share methodology. However, they
compute marginal tax rates much more precisely than we have done here using the
comprehensive Joint Committee on Taxation tax calculator. Like us, they find large
short-run elasticity estimates.

Notes: The figure depicts the share of wage income earned by the top 0.1% individuals (ranked

earnings available online. The top 0.1% is relative to the total potential population of employees
defined as 85% of the full US population aged 20-64. We choose a fixed fraction of the working
age population to incorporate the effects of fluctuations in employment in our wage income
concentration series. In year 2000, when the unemployment rate is slightly below 4%, the ratio of
the employed population (full-time plus part-time employees in National Accounts series) to the
population 20-64 reaches its highest level at 82.4%. Hence, 85% of the population aged 20-64
can be seen as a reasonable benchmark for the maximum potential population of employees.
Wage income is defined as W2 wage income (wages, salaries, and tips) inclusive of elective
retirement contributions (such as 401(k) contributions). Wage income also includes bonuses, and
profits from exercised stock-options. The source for the top wage income shares is Piketty and

Notes: Panel A depicts the top 1% income share in black triangles and two counterfactual trends
for the top 1% income shares that are used in the estimation of the behavioral elasticity of income
with respect to the net-of-tax rate. First, the figure depicts (in circles) the long-run straight-line
upward trend from 1978 to 2011. Second, the figure depicts (in diamonds) the medium-run
straight-line upward trend extrapolating linearly from the 2009 to 2011 recovery after the Great

Notes: this table presents the impact of the 2013 tax reform on top federal marginal tax rates (including the individual income tax and uncapped FICA
payroll taxes). The first three columns present the pre-reform marginal tax rates, the post-reform marginal tax rates, and the change pre to postreform, respectively. The next three columns show the income thresholds at which the tax changes apply for married joint filers, heads of households,
and singles, respectively. Panel A presents the health care tax (including the uncapped portion of FICA payroll taxes on earnings). The extra health care
tax of .9% on labor income (wage and self-employment earnings) applies above the stated thresholds for labor income. The extra health care tax of
3.8% on investment income applies when total gross income (formally defined as Modified Adjusted Gross Income) is above the stated thresholds.
Panel B presents the individual income tax including the change in the top bracket tax rate and the limitation on itemized deductions (this limitation
applies to over 90% of top 1% income earners so we assume that it applies systematically in our tax rate computations). Ordinary income includes all
forms of taxable income other than qualified dividends and long-term realized capital gains which are taxed at lower rates (as shown in the table).
Panel C shows the total effect of the 2013 tax reform on top federal marginal tax rates for each specific income component. Panel D presents the
effects of the tax reform on the average marginal tax rate for the top 1%, top .1%, and top 1-.1% income groups for income including capital gains
(Panel D1) and income excluding capital gains (Panel D2). In panels D1 and D2, the average is taken using the income composition of the top income
groups in 2011 using the top tax rates by income components from Panel C and ignoring other tax provisions such as the Alternative Minimum Tax or
the phase-out of personal exemptions.

Notes: This table presents the short-run elasticity estimates eS comparing 2012 and 2013. Each of the four columns considers a specific
income group: (1) top 1%, (2) top 1-.1% (top 1% excluding the top .1%), (3) top .1%, (4) top .01%. Panel A describes the computations in
detail for the elasticity of total income including capital gains with respect to the net-of-tax rate. The elasticity is estimated as the ratio
of the log-change in top income shares from 2012 to 2013 to the log-change in net-of-tax rates (from Table 1). The benchmark
estimates in Panel A assume no change in top income shares absent the tax reform. Panel B presents two alternative identification
assumptions. The first row of Panel B assumes that top income shares would have increased as the secular long-term average from
1978 to 2011. The second row of Panel B assumes that top income shares would have increased as the medium-term post Great
Recession increase from 2009 to 2011. In Panel C, we compute elasticity estimates for specific income components. The first row
repeats the elasticity estimate for total income with capital gains from Panel A. The second and third rows split total income into
realized capital gains and income excluding realized capital gains. The next rows split income excluding realized capital gains into:
wages and salaries, business income, dividend income, and other capital income (interest, rents, royalties, and estate and trust
income). As a robustness check, the elasticity for wage earnings is also computed using Social Security Administration (SSA) data by size
of wage earnings. Panel D computes elasticities around earlier reforms. The first row considers realized capital gains around the Tax
Reform Act of 1986 which increased the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 28%. The remaining rows consider the 1993 top tax rate
increase from 31% to 39.6%, and report elasticities for income excluding capital gains and wage earnings.

Notes: This table presents the medium-run elasticity estimates eM comparing 2011 and 2015. Each of the four columns considers a specific
income group: (1) top 1%, (2) top 1-.1% (top 1% excluding the top .1%), (3) top .1%, (4) top .01%. Panel A describes the computations in detail
for the elasticity of total income including capital gains with respect to the net-of-tax rate. The elasticity is estimated as the ratio of the logchange in top income shares from 2011 to 2015 (relative to the counterfactual change absent the reform) to the log-change in net-of-tax rates
(from Table 1). The benchmark estimates of Panel A assume that, absent the tax change, top income shares would have increased at the same
rate as the medium-term post Great Recession increase from 2009 to 2011 (see Figure 5). Panel B1 repeats the benchmark estimates in the
first row and presents two alternative identification assumptions in rows 2 and 3. The second row of Panel B1 assumes that top income shares
would have increased as the secular long-term average from 1978 to 2011 (see Figure 5). The third row of Panel B1 assumes that top income
shares would have stayed constant. Panel B2 repeats Panel B1 but for income excluding realized capital gains (instead of income including
capital gains). Panel D presents alternative elasticity estimates comparing years 2011 and 2014 (instead of 2015) and assuming as in our
benchmark that top income shares would have increased at the same rate as the medium-term post Great Recession increase from 2009 to
2011.
