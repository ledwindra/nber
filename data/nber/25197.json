    "abstract": "\n\nThis working paper explores the significant contributions to the history of African-American slavery made by the application of the tools of cliometrics.  As used here \u201ccliometrics\u201d is defined as a method of scientific analysis marked by the explicit use of economic theory and quantitative methods. American slavery of the late antebellum period [1840-1860] was one of the earliest topics that cliometricians focused on and, arguably, the topic upon which they made the largest impact.\n\n",
