JEL No. O10,O40
ABSTRACT
We propose a summary statistic for the economic well-being of people in a country. Our measure incorporates
consumption, leisure, mortality, and inequality, first for a narrow set of countries using detailed micro
data, and then more broadly using multi-country data sets. While welfare is highly correlated with
GDP per capita, deviations are often large. Western Europe looks considerably closer to the U.S., emerging
Asia has not caught up as much, and many developing countries are further behind. Each component
we introduce plays a significant role in accounting for these differences, with mortality being most
important.

JONES AND KLENOW

Introduction

As many economists have noted, GDP is a flawed measure of economic welfare. Leisure,
inequality, mortality, morbidity, crime, and the natural environment are just some of
the major factors affecting living standards within a country that are incorporated imperfectly, if at all, in GDP. The Stiglitz Commission Report (Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi,
2009) was the latest attempt to sort through the criticisms of GDP and seek practical recommendations for improvement. Though there are significant conceptual and
empirical hurdles to including some of these factors in a welfare measure, standard
economic analysis is arguably well-equipped to deal with several of them.
We propose a simple summary statistic for the welfare of a country’s population,
measured as a consumption equivalent, and compute its level and growth rate for a
diverse set of countries. This welfare measure combines data on consumption, leisure,
inequality, and mortality using the standard economics of expected utility. The focus
on consumption-equivalent welfare follows in the tradition of Lucas (1987), who calculated the welfare benefits of eliminating business cycles versus raising the growth rate.
As an example, suppose we wish to compare living standards in France and the
United States. GDP per person is markedly lower in France: France had a per capita
GDP in 2005 of just 67 percent of the U.S. value. Consumption per person in France was
even lower — only 60 percent of the U.S., even adding government consumption to private consumption. However, other indicators looked better in France. Life expectancy
at birth was around 80 years in France versus 77 years in the U.S. Leisure was higher
in France — Americans worked 877 hours (per person, not per worker) versus only
535 hours for the French. Inequality was substantially lower in France: the standard
deviation of log consumption was around 0.54 in the U.S. but only 0.42 in France.
Our welfare metric combines each of these factors with the level of consumption using an expected utility framework. We do this in two ways. First, we use detailed micro
data from household surveys for 13 countries to provide a measure of welfare with as
few assumptions as possible. Then, we use publicly-available multi-country data sets
to construct cruder welfare measures for 152 countries. Cross-checking these “macro”
results with the detailed “micro” results suggests that there is valuable information even
using the coarse multi-country data sets.
Our consumption-equivalent measure aims to answer questions such as: what pro-

WELFARE ACROSS COUNTRIES AND TIME

portion of consumption in the U.S., given the U.S. values of leisure, mortality, and
inequality, would deliver the same expected flow utility as the values in France? In
our results, lower mortality, lower inequality, and higher leisure each add roughly 10
percentage points to French welfare in terms of equivalent consumption. Rather than
looking like 60 percent of the U.S. value, as it does based solely on consumption, France
ends up with consumption-equivalent welfare equal to 92 percent of that in the U.S.1
The French example applies more broadly to Western Europe as a whole, but for
the poorer countries of the world, the opposite is typically true. Because of lower life
expectancy and higher inequality, their consumption equivalent welfare is often less
than their income: Western Europe is closer to the U.S., but poor and middle-income
countries are typically further behind. More generally, our findings can be summarized
as follows:
1. GDP per person is an informative indicator of welfare across a broad range of
countries: the two measures have a correlation of 0.98. Nevertheless, there are
economically important differences between GDP per person and consumption
equivalent welfare. Across our 13 countries, the median deviation is around 35%
— so disparities like we see in France are quite common.
2. Average Western European living standards appear much closer to those in the
United States (around 85% for welfare versus 67% for income) when we take into
account Europe’s longer life expectancy, additional leisure time, and lower inequality.
3. Most developing countries — including much of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, southern Asia, and China — are substantially poorer than incomes suggest
because of a combination of shorter lives and extreme inequality. Lower life expectancy reduces welfare by 15 to 50% in the developing countries we examine.
Combined with the previous finding, the upshot is that, across countries, welfare
inequality appears even greater than income inequality.
4. Growth rates are typically revised upward, with welfare growth averaging 3.1%
between the 1980s and the mid-2000s versus income growth of 2.1%. A boost

Our calculations do not conflict with Prescott’s (2004) argument that Americans work more than
Europeans because of lower marginal tax rates in the U.S. But the higher leisure in France partially
compensates for their lower consumption.

from rising life expectancy of more than a percentage point shows up throughout
the world, with the notable exception of sub-Saharan Africa. If welfare grows 3%
instead of 2% per year, living standards double in 24 years instead of 36 years; over
a century, this leads to a 20-fold increase rather than a 7-fold increase.2
The U.S.-France comparison, and our results for other countries, emphasize an
important point. High hours worked per capita and a high investment rate are wellknown to deliver high GDP per capita, other things being equal. But these strategies
have associated costs that are not reflected in GDP. Our welfare measure values the
high GDP but adjusts for the lower leisure and lower consumption share to produce a
more complete picture of living standards.
This paper builds on a large collection of related work. Nordhaus and Tobin (1972)
introduced a “Measure of Economic Welfare” that combines consumption and leisure,
values household work, and deducts urban disamenities for the U.S. over time. We
incorporate life expectancy and inequality and make comparisons across countries as
well as over time, but we do not attempt to account for urban disamenities. The United
Nations Human Development Index combines income, life expectancy, and literacy,
first putting each variable on a scale from zero to one and then averaging. In comparison, we combine different ingredients (consumption rather than income, leisure
rather than literacy, plus inequality) using a utility function to arrive at a consumptionequivalent welfare measure that can be compared across time for a given country as
well as across countries. Ravallion (2010) criticizes “mashup indices” like the Human
Development Index for their arbitrary nature; our approach is explicitly grounded in
economic theory. Fleurbaey (2009) contains a more comprehensive review of attempts
at constructing measures of social welfare.
Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005) use a utility function to combine income and
life expectancy into a full income measure. Their focus is on the evolution of crosscountry dispersion, and their main finding is that dispersion decreases significantly
over time when one combines life expectancy with income. Our broader welfare measure includes leisure and inequality as well as life expectancy, and uses consumption
instead of income as the base. All of these differences are first-order to our findings.
And we emphasize results for individual countries, not just trends in dispersion.

Our results reinforce research on welfare gains from rising life expectancy. See Nordhaus (2003),
Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005), Murphy and Topel (2006), and Hall and Jones (2007).

Fleurbaey and Gaulier (2009) construct a full-income measure for 24 OECD countries. Like us, they incorporate life expectancy, leisure, and inequality. Our paper differs in many details, both methodological and empirical. For example, we focus on
consumption instead of income, report results for countries at all stages of development, and consider growth rates as well as levels. Boarini, Johansson and d’Ercole
(2006) is another related paper that focuses on OECD countries. They construct a fullincome measure by valuing leisure using wages and combining it with per capita GDP.
They consider adjusting household income for inequality according to various social
welfare functions and, separately, consider differences in social indicators such as life
expectancy and social capital. Our approach differs in using expected utility to create a
single statistic for living standards in a much larger set of countries.
There are many limitations to the welfare metric we use, and a few deserve special
mention at the outset. First, we evaluate the allocations both within and across countries according to one set of preferences. We do consider different functional forms
and parameter values in our robustness checks. Second, we do not try to measure
morbidity. We use life expectancy as a very imperfect measure of health. Third, we
make no account for direct utility benefits from the quality of the natural environment,
public safety, or political freedom.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the simple theory
underlying the calculations. Section 3 describes the micro data that we use for our
main results in Section 4. Section 5 explores robustness. Section 6 presents results for
a large set of countries using publicly-available data. Section 7 concludes.

2.

Theory

Comparing GDPs across countries requires the use of a common set of prices. Similarly,
although people in different countries may have different preferences, we compare
welfare across countries using a common specification for preferences. To be concrete,
we consider a fictitious person possessing these preferences and call him “Rawls.”
Behind the veil of ignorance, Rawls is confronted with a lottery. He will live his entire
life in a particular country. He doesn’t know whether he will be rich or poor, hardworking or living a life of leisure, or even whether some deadly disease will kill him before
he gets a chance to enjoy much of his life. Over his life, he will draw from the cross-

6

JONES AND KLENOW

section distributions of consumption and leisure and from the cross-section mortality
distribution corresponding to each age in a particular year. What proportion of Rawls’
annual consumption living his life in the United States would make him indifferent to
living life instead in, say, China or France? Call the answer to this question λChina or λFrance .
This is a consumption-equivalent measure of the standard of living. In the interest of
brevity, we will sometimes simply call this “welfare,” but strictly speaking we mean a
consumption-equivalent measure.
A quick note on a possible source of confusion. In naming our individual “Rawls” we
are referencing the veil of ignorance emphasized by Rawls (1971) and Harsanyi (1953).
In contrast, we wish to distance ourselves from the maximin social welfare function
advocated by Rawls that puts all weight on the least well-off person in society. While
that is one possible case we could consider, it is extreme and far from our benchmark
case. As we discuss next, our focus is a utilitarian expected utility calculation giving
equal weight to each person.

2.1. The Main Setup
Let C denote an individual’s annual consumption and ℓ denote leisure plus time spent
in home production. Expected lifetime utility is then

U =E

100
X

β a u(Ca , ℓa )S(a),

(1)

a=1

where S(a) is the probability an individual survives to age a and the expectations operator applies to the uncertainty with respect to consumption and leisure. To implement
our welfare calculation, let Ui (λ) denote expected lifetime utility in country i if consumption is multiplied by a factor λ at each age:

Ui (λ) = Ei

100
X

β a u(λCai , ℓai )Si (a).

(2)

a=1

By what factor, λi , must we adjust Rawls’ consumption to make him indifferent between living his life as a random person in the U.S. and living in some other country i?
The answer to this question satisfies
Uus (λi ) = Ui (1).

(3)

7

WELFARE ACROSS COUNTRIES AND TIME

The remainder of this paper implements this calculation in a variety of ways, both
across countries to compare levels of welfare and over time to compute measures of
welfare growth. For each country-year, we use cross-sectional data on consumption
and leisure and cross-sectional data on mortality by age, treating individuals as drawing
from this cross-section (adding growth) over their lifetime.

2.2. An Illustrative Example
To see how we implement this calculation, an example is helpful. This example makes
strong assumptions to get simple results that are useful for intuition. We will relax many
of these assumptions in the next subsection. First, assume that flow utility for Rawls is
u(C, ℓ) = ū + log C + v(ℓ),

(4)

where v(ℓ) captures the utility from leisure and home production. Next, suppose that
consumption in each country is lognormally distributed across people at a point in
time, independent of age and mortality, with arithmetic mean ci and a variance of log
consumption of σi2 . Then E[log C] = log c − σ 2 /2. Over time, assume that consumption
grows at a constant rate g. Finally, assume for now that leisure is constant across ages
and certain. Under these assumptions, expected lifetime utility is given by
simple

(5)

In the special case in which β = 1 and g = 0, the terms involving the survival rates

simplify. In particular, e ≡ a S(a) equals life expectancy at birth, and we have

(6)

That is, lifetime utility is just the product of life expectancy and expected flow utility
from each year. In this special case, consumption equivalent welfare in (3) becomes:

JONES AND KLENOW

This expression provides an additive decomposition of the forces that determine
welfare in country i relative to the United States. The first term captures the effect of
differences in life expectancy: it is the percentage difference in life expectancy weighted
by how much a year of life is worth — the flow utility in country i. The remaining three
terms denote the contributions of differences in consumption, leisure, and inequality.
At the end of the paper, we will use (7) to compute consumption-equivalent welfare for
a large sample of countries using readily available data sources.3

2.3. Welfare Calculations using Micro Data
While the example above is helpful for intuition, our micro data is much richer, allowing far fewer assumptions. Let the triplet {j, a, i} represent individual j of age a ∈
i ,
{1, ..., 100} in country i. Denote the sampling weight on individual j in country i as ωja

and the number of individuals of age a in country i as Nai . We make the convenient
assumption that the possible levels of consumption and leisure match the levels seen
for individuals in the sample in each age group in each country-year. Within each age
group, we normalize the sampling weights to sum to 1:
i
ω̄ja

i
ωja

≡ PN i

j=1 ωja

(8)

Behind the veil of ignorance, expected utility for Rawls in country i is

Ui =

ω̄ja
u(cija ega , ℓija ),

(9)

j=1

where Sai is the probability of surviving to age a in country i. Note that each age group
is weighted by country-specific survival rates rather than local population shares. As
before, U i (λ) denotes expected utility for Rawls in country i if consumption is reduced
by proportion λ in all realizations of consumption and leisure. Our consumptionequivalent welfare metric λi continues to be defined implicitly by U us (λi ) = U i (1).
For our benchmark case, we assume the utility function in equation (4). In Section 5
we will consider preferences with more curvature over consumption and relax the addi3
This decomposition, and the richer one below using micro data, is not without problems. For example,
consumption of healthcare, food, and shelter all influence life expectancy. With better data and a deeper
understanding of how life expectancy is produced, one could make better comparisons.

tive separability with leisure, but this simpler specification turns out to be conservative
and yields clean, easily-interpreted closed-form solutions. Because of additive utility
over log consumption plus an intercept and a leisure term, we get

We can then solve for the scaling of consumption that equates expected utility in the

Rawls requires compensation to move from the U.S. to country i to the extent that
survival rates are higher in the U.S. (multiplied by flow utility in country i) and to the
extent that flow utility is higher in the U.S.
To ease notation, define lower case survival rates (in levels and differences) as normalized by the sum of U.S. survival rates:4

where ỹi ≡ yi /yus . Looking at welfare relative to income simply changes the interpretation of consumption in the decomposition. The consumption term now refers to the
share of consumption in GDP. A country with a low consumption share will have lower
welfare relative to income, other things equal. Of course, if this occurs because the
investment rate is high, this will raise welfare in the long run (as long as the economy is
below the golden rule). Nevertheless, flow utility will be low relative to per capita GDP.

2.4. Equivalent Variation versus Compensating Variation
The welfare metric above is an equivalent variation: by what proportion must we adjust
Rawls’ consumption in the U.S. so that his welfare equals that in other countries. Alternatively, we could consider a compensating variation: by what factor must we increase
Rawls’ consumption in country i to raise welfare there to the U.S. level. Inverting this
number gives a compensating variation measure of welfare, λcv
i . The resulting welfare
measure is very similar to the equivalent variation decomposed in equation (19), with
one key difference: in the life expectancy term in the first line of the equation, the
equivalent variation weights differences in survival probabilities by a country’s own
flow utility, while the compensating variation weights differences by U.S. flow utility.5
5

Another related difference is that the denominator of ∆sia becomes the cumulative discounted
survival in the country under consideration, rather than in the U.S.

WELFARE ACROSS COUNTRIES AND TIME

11

This distinction turns out to matter greatly for poor countries. In particular, flow
utility in the poorest countries of the world is estimated to be small, so their low life
expectancy has a surprisingly small effect on the equivalent variation: flow utility is
low, so it makes little difference that people in such a country live for 50 years instead of 80 years. Thus large shortfalls in life expectancy do not change the equivalent
variation measure much in very poor countries, which seems extreme. In contrast,
the compensating variation values differences in life expectancy using the U.S. flow
utility, which is estimated to be large. Such differences then have a substantial effect on
consumption-equivalent welfare. For our benchmark measure, we take a conservative
approach and report the equivalent variation. In the robustness section, we show that
the compensating variation strengthens our main results.

2.5. The Welfare Calculation over Time
Suppose the country i that we are comparing to is not China or France but rather the
U.S. itself in an earlier year. In this case, one can divide by the number of periods, e.g.
T = 2007 − 1980 = 27, and obtain a growth rate of the consumption equivalent. And of
course we can do this for any country, not just the U.S.:
gi ≡ −

1
log λi .
T

(20)

This growth rate can similarly be decomposed into terms reflecting changes in life
expectancy, consumption, leisure, and inequality, as in equation (19).6

3.

Micro Data and Calibration

To calculate consumption-equivalent welfare, we use Household Survey data from the
U.S., Brazil, China, France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malawi, Mexico, Russia, South Africa,
Spain and the U.K. See Table 1 for a list of the datasets, years, and sample sizes.7 A de6
The issue of equivalent vs. compensating variation arises in the growth rate too. Treating 2007 as
the benchmark — an equivalent variation — means that the percentage change in life expectancy gets
weighted by the flow utility in 1980. Treating 1980 as the benchmark — a compensating variation —
weights the percentage change in life expectancy by flow utility in 2007. We average the equivalent and
compensating variations for growth rates, as is common practice in the literature.

Krueger, Perri, Pistaferri and Violante (2010) describe an impressive set of recent papers tracking
inequality in earnings, consumption, income and wealth over time in 10 countries. We use the cleaned

Household Surveys enable us to calculate consumption inequality for an arbitrary
distribution of consumption instead of assuming (say) a log-normal distribution.8 With
datasets they made available for Italy, Russia, Spain, and the U.S.

household-level data we can be more confident that consumption is defined consistently across countries and time. For every country we exclude expenditures on durable
goods and focus on nondurables and services (including rent and owner-occupied housing among services).9
The micro data we use report the age composition of each household. We allocate
consumption equally to each household member. We can take into account household
size and age composition in a way that publicly available Gini coefficients do not.
Our household surveys include hours worked for adults and at least older children
in the household. For the children below the age covered in the survey, we assume
zero hours worked. Importantly, the surveys ask about time spent in self-employment,
including subsistence agriculture. We calculate leisure as (5840 – hours worked in the
year)/5840, where 5840 = 16 hours a day * 365 days.10
As with consumption, having leisure by age allows us to deal with differences in
the age composition of the population across countries and time. Moreover, we can
estimate the welfare cost of leisure inequality, just as we estimate the welfare cost of
consumption inequality (again using the observed distribution).
From behind the Rawlsian veil, consumption and leisure interact with mortality to
determine expected utility. We combine data from Household Surveys with mortality
rates by age from the World Health Organization.11

3.1. Summary statistics from the micro data
This section aggregates our underlying micro data in various ways to shed light on the
components of our welfare calculation.

people in our Household Survey countries. We divide household expenditures equally
across people in each household, and add per capita government consumption in the

In principle we would like to include the service flow from the stock of durable goods. But most
Household Surveys cover only lumpy durable expenditures rather than household stocks of durable goods.
10
For countries such as the U.S., we have weeks worked per year as well hours worked per week. For
most countries, however, the Household Surveys only cover hours per week, so we draw on OECD and
other sources for weeks worked per worker. See the Online Appendix.

rates are inferred from child mortality rates. See http://www.who.int/whr/2006/annex/06 annex1 en.pdf

using U.S. survival rates by age, analogous to the way we construct the mean of log

Parente, Rogerson and Wright (2000) argue that barriers to capital accumulation explain some of the
variation in market hours worked. Like us, they emphasize that the gain in home production can partially
offset the loss in market output. Prescott (2004) attributes some of the OECD differences in hours worked
to differences in tax rates, as do Ohanian, Raffo and Rogerson (2008).

the macro literature, we assume utility from leisure takes a form that implies a constant
Frisch elasticity of labor supply (that is, holding the marginal utility of consumption
fixed, the elasticity of labor supply with respect to the wage is constant). Since labor
supply in our setting is 1 − ℓ, in terms of the utility function in equation (4) this gives
θǫ
v(ℓ) = − 1+ǫ
(1 − ℓ)

1+ǫ
ǫ

, where ǫ denotes the Frisch elasticity. This leaves five parameters

to be calibrated: the growth rate g, the discount factor β, the Frisch elasticity ǫ, the
utility weight on leisure or home production θ, and the intercept in flow utility ū.
We choose a common growth rate of 2% per year. An alternative would be to try to
forecast future growth rates for each country, but such forecasts would have very large
standard errors, particularly since we would need forecasts for every year over the next
century. We set the discount factor to β = 0.99. Recall that there is already additional
discounting inherent in the expected utility calculation because of mortality.
Surveying evidence such as Pistaferri (2003), Hall (2009a,b) suggests a benchmark
value for the Frisch elasticity of 0.7 for the intensive (hours) margin and 1.9 for the
extensive and intensive margins combined. Chetty (2012) reconciles micro and macro
estimates of the Frisch elasticity and recommends a value of 0.5 or 0.6 for the intensive
margin. We consider a Frisch elasticity of 1.0 for our benchmark calibration, which

WELFARE ACROSS COUNTRIES AND TIME

17

implies that the disutility from working rises with the square of the number of hours
worked. As we discuss in the robustness section, the results are not sensitive to this
choice.
To get the utility weight on the disutility from working, θ, recall that the first-order
condition for the labor-leisure decision is uℓ /uc = w(1 − τ ), where w is the real wage
and τ is the marginal tax rate on labor income. Our functional forms then imply θ =
w(1 − τ )(1 − ℓ)−1/ǫ /c. For our benchmark calibration, we assume this first-order condition holds for the average prime-age worker (25-55 years old) in the U.S. Consumer
Expenditure Survey (CE) in 2006. We take the marginal tax rate in the U.S. from Barro
and Redlick (2011), who report a value of 0.353 for 2006. Taking into account the ratio
of earnings to consumption and average leisure among 25-55 year olds of ℓus = 0.656
in the CE, we arrive at θ = 14.2.13
Calibration of the intercept in flow utility, ū, is less familiar. This parameter is critical
for valuing differences in mortality. We choose ū so that a 40 year old, facing the consumption and leisure uncertainty in the 2006 U.S. distribution, has a value of remaining
life equal to $6 million in 2007 prices.14 In their survey of the literature, Viscusi and Aldy
(2003) recommend values in the range of $5.5–$7.5 million. Murphy and Topel (2006)
choose a value of around $6 million. Our baseline value of $6 million is broadly consistent with this literature. This choice leads to ū = 5.00 when aggregate consumption
per capita in the U.S. is normalized to 1 in 2007. With these preferences, the implied
value of life will be substantially lower in poor countries; see Kremer, Leino, Miguel
and Zwane (2011) for evidence consistent with this implication. Wider evidence on the
value of life in developing countries is admittedly scant.

4.

Welfare across Countries and over Time

We begin with levels of consumption-equivalent welfare for the 13 countries for which
we have detailed micro data. The calculation is based on equation (19), implemented
for the most recent year we have household survey data and with Penn World Tables
13

We scale up CE consumption expenditures in three ways. First, we add in durables expenditures in
2006, to approximate their flow value. Second, we take into account that CE expenditures were only 61.9
percent of NIPA consumption in that year. Third, we scale up consumption by the Penn World Tables 8.0
ratio of (private plus public consumption)/(private consumption) for the U.S. in 2006.
14
For this computation, we use the same data and parameters that we use later in the paper to compute
λ. For example, we discount the future at rate β = 0.99 and allow consumption to grow at 2% per year.

18

JONES AND KLENOW

8.0 data on consumption and income. Our first finding can be summarized as follows:
Key Point 1: GDP per person is an excellent indicator of welfare across the broad
range of countries: the two measures have a correlation of 0.98. Nevertheless,
for any given country, the difference between the two measures can be important. Across 13 countries, the median deviation is about 35%.
Figure 5 illustrates this first point. The top panel plots the welfare measure, λ, against
GDP per person. What emerges prominently is that the two measures are extremely
highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient (for the logs) of 0.98. Thus per capita
GDP is a good proxy for welfare under our assumptions. At the same time, there are
clear departures from the 45-degree line. In particular, many countries with very low
GDP per capita exhibit even lower welfare. As a result, welfare is more dispersed (standard deviation of 1.51 in logs) than is income (standard deviation of 1.27 in logs).
The bottom panel provides a closer look at the deviations. This figure plots the ratio
of welfare to per capita GDP across countries. The European countries have welfare
measures 22% higher than their incomes. The remaining countries, in contrast, have
welfare levels that are typically 25 to 50 percent below their incomes. The way to reconcile these large deviations with the high correlation between welfare and income is that
the “scales” are so different. Incomes vary by more than a factor of 64 in our sample —
i.e. 6300 percent — whereas the deviations are on the order of 25 to 50 percent.
Key Point 2: Average Western European living standards appear much closer to
those in the United States when we take into account Europe’s longer life expectancy, additional leisure time, and lower levels of inequality.
Table 2 provides a closer look at the welfare decomposition based on (19). The U.K.,
France, Italy, and Spain all have per capita incomes around 2/3 that in the U.S. Consumptionequivalent welfare is about 22 log points higher, averaging 85 percent of that in the U.S.
Consider the case of France. Income in France is 67 percent of the U.S. level. Longer
life expectancy, additional leisure, and lower inequality of consumption and leisure
each boost welfare. Taken together, consumption-equivalent welfare is more than 90
percent of the U.S. level. The green numbers in the table help to make sense of this
difference. Mortality rates are significantly lower in France than in the U.S. Life expectancy is 80.1 years in France versus 77.4 years in the U.S. This difference adds 15 log

Notes: The table shows the consumption-equivalent welfare calculation based on equation (19). See
Table 1 for sources and years. The second line for each country shows life expectancy, the ratio of

points to welfare. With respect to leisure, average annual hours worked per capita in
the U.S. are 877 versus only 535 in France: the average person in France works less than
two-thirds as much as the average person in the U.S. The implied difference in leisure
adds 8 log points to welfare.

WELFARE ACROSS COUNTRIES AND TIME

21

Next, consider consumption inequality. The standard deviation of log consumption
in the French micro data is 0.422 versus 0.538 in the U.S. To see how this affects welfare,
consider a hypothetical in which consumption is log-normally distributed. In this case,
lower inequality adds .5(.5382 − .4222 ) = .056, or 5.6 percent, to welfare. Without
imposing the log-normal approximation we get 10.2 log points. Interestingly, with our
additively separable preferences and behind the veil-of-ignorance approach it does not
matter to our calculation whether consumption inequality is permanent from birth or
i.i.d. at each age. Rawls values the consumption uncertainty in exactly the same way.
Finally, consider leisure inequality. Our baseline preferences specify a Frisch elasticity of labor supply of one, which implies a disutility from working that depends on
the square of annual hours worked. The standard deviation of annual hours per capita
is 1091 in the U.S. versus 747 in France. With convex costs of working, this heterogeneity adds 12 log points to welfare in France. One can combine this number with the
consumption inequality number to say that lower inequality raises welfare in France
relative to the U.S. by more than 20 log points.
The exact numbers — either for France or for the other European countries — depend on the specific assumptions we make. As we will show later, however, the general
point that welfare in Western Europe is much closer to U.S. levels than the income
comparisons suggest is quite robust.
Key Point 3: Many developing countries — including all eight of the non-European
countries in our sample — are poorer than incomes suggest because of a combination of shorter lives, low consumption shares, and extreme inequality.
The country details are reported in the lower half of Table 2. The same story appears
repeatedly. A life expectancy of only 67 years cuts Russia’s welfare by 50 log points, or
around 40 percent. South Africa’s high mortality leads to a life expectancy of 61 years
in 1993 (even lower by 2007 we’ll see later), which reduces welfare by 55 logs points.
Interestingly, the even lower life expectancy in Malawi of just over 50 years only reduces
welfare there by 39 log points. Why the difference?
As can be seen in equation (19) or (7), the loss from low life expectancy is weighted
by the value of flow utility — the utility lost from living one year less. Malawi is much
poorer than South Africa, so its shortfall in life expectancy is penalized less.15 As we will
15

Table A3 in the Online Appendix reports the implied value of life in each of our 13 countries.

22

JONES AND KLENOW

show, this is a key place where the equivalent variation differs from the compensating
variation. The compensating variation weights differences in mortality by U.S. flow
utility. In the robustness section, we’ll see this leads to much larger welfare differences.
A second reason that welfare is lower than income in several countries is that average consumption – as a share of income – is low relative to the United States. Utility
depends on consumption, not income, and a low consumption share of income implies lower consumption. Of course, an offsetting effect is that the low consumption
share may raise consumption in the future. To the extent that countries are close to
their steady states, this force is already incorporated in our calculation. However, in
countries with recent upward trends in the investment rate, our calculation will understate steady-state welfare. China is an obvious candidate for this qualification, though
correcting for this has a modest effect.16
High consumption inequality is a final force contributing to lower welfare in many
developing countries, with the sharpest examples being Brazil and South Africa. Consumption inequality in Brazil reduces welfare by 21 percent and in South Africa by 28
percent. In contrast, the effects of leisure and leisure inequality are relatively small
in developing countries: annual hours worked per person and its heterogeneity are
similar to levels in the U.S.

4.1. Growth Rates
We turn now to welfare growth over time. Rather than comparing Rawls’ expected
utility from living in the U.S. versus another country in the same year, we now consider
how Rawls might value living in the same country at two different points in time. The
decomposition in equation (19) remains valid, only we now express it in growth rate
terms as in (20). We begin with a point that summarizes the differences between welfare
growth and growth in per capita GDP:
Key Point 4: Welfare growth averages 3.1% between the 1980s and mid-2000s,
versus income growth of 2.1%, across the seven countries for which we have
household surveys during these periods. A boost from rising life expectancy of
about 1 percentage point per year accounts for the difference.
16

For example, see Table 8 of Jones and Klenow (2010).

Note: The table shows a decomposition for average annual consumption-equivalent welfare growth based
on equation (20). Years are shown in parentheses. Average denotes the average across the nine countries,
while Average ∗ excludes Russia and Brazil. The second line for each country displays the raw data on life
expectancy, the ratio of consumption to income, annual hours worked per capita, the standard deviation
of log consumption, and the standard deviation of annual hours worked, for the start and ending year,
computed with no discounting or growth.

Figure 6 documents a high correlation (0.97) between welfare growth and income
growth across our micro dataset countries. Russia is an obvious outlier – our household
survey years of 1998 and 2007 correspond to a period of rapid Russian growth. The
lower panel of the figure shows that the typical country gains about a percentage point
of growth when shifting from income to welfare. Growing at 3% instead of 2% per year,
living standards double in 24 years instead of 36 years; over a century, this leads to a
20-fold increase rather than a 7-fold increase.

The source of the gain is evident in Table 3. As shown in the last row of the table, the
bulk of the gain for the average country results from the life expectancy term. Living
standards are rising mostly because of rising consumption per year of life. But the fact
that we can enjoy our consumption over a longer lifetime is also important.17
The details of specific countries lead to additional insights. Falling leisure and rising
inequality have reduced growth by roughly half a percentage point in the U.S., Italy, and
Mexico. For example, in the U.S. annual hours worked per person rose from 810 to 889
between 1984 and 2006. We estimate that this falling leisure reduced consumptionequivalent welfare growth by about a tenth of a percentage point per year. According to
the Consumer Expenditure Survey, consumption inequality rose, reducing growth by
another 24 basis points.18 Finally, rising leisure inequality reduces U.S. welfare growth
another 8 basis points. Taken together, these three channels reduce consumptionequivalent welfare growth in the U.S. by 42 basis points per year.
Mexico and Italy exhibit similar patterns. Falling leisure reduces welfare growth by
0.17 percentage points per year in Italy and 0.23 percentage points per year in Mexico.
Rising consumption and leisure inequality,combined, reduce growth by 0.46 and 0.30
percentage points per year in Italy and Mexico. The sum of these three forces is therefore about 0.63 percentage points per year in Italy and 0.53 percentage points per year
in Mexico.

Robustness

Here we gauge the robustness to alternative assumptions, such as about the utility
function. Table 4 shows that the gap we find between welfare and income is quite
robust. More detailed results — including decompositions for France, China, and Indonesia — are available in an Online Appendix.
The second row of Table 4 indicates that, if we do not discount or incorporate growth,
the differences between welfare and income are somewhat smaller than in the baseline
case. A similar finding applies if we evaluate utility only for those age 2 and older;
17

Nordhaus (2003) offered a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggesting that rising life expectancy over
the 20th century was as important to welfare as consumption growth. Our calculation using micro data
for a range of countries supports the tenor or his, though our estimate is closer to one-half.
18
The CES displays a relatively small increase in consumption inequality, as emphasized by Krueger
and Perri (2006). According to Aguiar and Bils (2013), savings and Engel Curves in the CES suggest that
consumption inequality rose as much as income inequality in the U.S. over this period.

Note: Entries are the median absolute deviation of λỹii from 100% in the levels case and gλ −
gy in the growth rate case. (a) The sample size changes when we move to the CRRA/CFE
preferences. In particular, we require both consumption and leisure to come from the
same household survey, which rules out Brazil and Spain (and India for growth). Also,
countries for which the growth rate starts before 1990 use the 1990 mortality rates in the
initial year with no correction in the CRRA/CFE case (the numbers are scaled to reflect
the changing years in the log case, where the terms can be separated additively). The case
of γ = 1 and c = 0 is reported separately here to reflect the changing sample size and
treatment of mortality growth (otherwise, it is identical to the benchmark case).

differences in infant mortality matter, but do not drive the results. Evaluating expected
utility only for those age 40 and older has little effect on level comparisons, but widens
the growth rate differences (from a median of 1.0% to 1.6% per year).

5.1. Equivalent Variation and Compensating Variation
Recall that our benchmark results are based on equivalent variations (EV). Table 4 indicates that the median gap between welfare and income relative to the U.S. is 44 percent
if we use compensating variations (CV), compared to the 35 percent we get in the
baseline with EV.
As discussed in Section 2, the distinction between EV and CV rests primarily on

27

WELFARE ACROSS COUNTRIES AND TIME

whether differences in life expectancy are valued using a country’s own flow utility (for
EV) or the U.S. flow utility (for CV). For rich countries, this makes little difference. Even
for a country with moderate income, like China, the differences are relatively small. The
difference between EV and CV is more apparent for extremely poor countries. Consider
Malawi. Our EV-based welfare ratio for the U.S. vs. Malawi, which weights Malawi’s
lower life expectancy by its own utility flow, is 106 (i.e., over 100 times the consumptionequivalent in the U.S. as in Malawi). The CV-based welfare ratio, which uses U.S. flow
utility to value the shortfall in Malawi’s life expectancy, is comparatively enormous at
796.

5.2. Alternative Utility Specifications
Our benchmark utility function adds log consumption, a leisure term, and an intercept.
This yields an additive decomposition of welfare differences. Now consider a more
general utility function with non-separable preferences over consumption and leisure:
u(C, ℓ) = ū +

(C + c)1−γ
1−γ



1 + (γ − 1)

1+ǫ
θǫ
(1 − ℓ) ǫ
1+ǫ

γ

−

1
.
1−γ

(21)

This functional form reduces to our baseline specification when γ = 1 and c = 0.
When c = 0, this is the “constant Frisch elasticity” functional form advocated by
Shimer (2009) and Trabandt and Uhlig (2009). The parameter ǫ is the constant Frisch
elasticity of labor supply (the elasticity of time spent working with respect to the real
wage, holding fixed the marginal utility of consumption).
Several cases in Table 4 impose more curvature over consumption than in the log
case. With γ = 1.5 — and c = 0.05 to prevent Rawls from preferring death to life in
poor countries like Malawi — the median absolute percentage deviation of welfare
from income rises a little, and the growth deviation falls somewhat.19 Consumption
inequality is more costly to Rawls with γ = 1.5 than in our baseline of γ = 1.
The next row of Table 4 increases curvature further to γ = 2, while at the same
time boosting the intercept to c = 0.20. The median gap between welfare and income
19

Even with log utility, it is conceivable for expected lifetime utility to be negative if consumption is
sufficiently low. In our baseline case, this does not occur for any country, and in fact expected flow utility
at each age is also positive in all countries. When we boost γ above one, however, this is no longer true. We
pick a “round” value for c that ensures that all countries (with Malawi being the most binding case) have
positive expected lifetime utility.

28

JONES AND KLENOW

becomes notably wider at 45 percent.
We next consider a higher weight on leisure versus consumption in utility. As in the
baseline we have γ = 1 and c = 0, but we now increase the value of θ. In particular, we
choose θ to rationalize the higher choice of average leisure in France than in the U.S.
Increasing the importance of leisure in this way makes little difference.
Toward the end of Table 4, we consider alternative values for the Frisch elasticity of
labor supply: 0.5 from Chetty (2012) or 2.0 at the upper end of Hall’s (2009b) recommended range. These changes, too, have little effect on our results.
In our baseline case we assumed kids enjoy 100 percent leisure time. An alternative
would be to assume kids’ leisure is the same as adults’ leisure, on average. As shown in
Table 4, this change does not move us far from our baseline numbers.
Our final robustness check is to change the intercept in the utility function. We set
the intercept so that the remaining value of life for a 40 year old in the U.S. in 2005
dollars is $5 million or $7 million rather than the baseline value of $6 million. With a
value of life of $5 million in the U.S., the intercept in the utility function falls. Life is
worth less in all countries, so differences in life expectancy play a smaller role. This
reduces the welfare gain from higher longevity in European countries like France and
mitigates the welfare loss from low lifespan in developing countries like China. Overall,
the median deviation between welfare and income falls from our benchmark value of
35% to a smaller but still substantial 30%.
With a U.S. value of life of $7 million, the contrast between welfare and income is
sharper. The deviation between welfare and income rises to almost 40% rather than
35% in levels, and to 1.1% per year rather than 1.0% per year in 1980–2007 growth rates.
With more utility from a year of life, differences in the levels and growth rates of life
expectancy naturally matter more.

Measuring Welfare for a Broad Range of Countries

We now calculate consumption-equivalent welfare for a broader set of countries and
years. The caveat is that much stronger assumptions are required because of data
limitations; these calculations are based on the “illustrative example” given at the start
of the paper in equation (7). We assume consumption is lognormally distributed and
is independent of age. We assume β = 1 and g = 0 so that survival rates can be

summarized by a single statistic – life expectancy, which is widely available. We will
refer to this as a “macro” calculation, as it relies on publicly-available multi-country
datasets instead of micro data from household surveys.
The data sources for the macro calculation are discussed in detail in our Online
Appendix. Briefly, we use Penn World Table 8.0 to measure income, consumption,
employment, and population. This source also provides hours worked for 52 (mostly
rich) countries. We use the UNU-WIDER World Income Inequality Database, Version
3.0a, which is itself a summary of micro surveys, to measure consumption inequality;
this database reports Gini coefficients which we convert to the standard deviation of
log consumption under the assumption of log normality.20 Finally, life expectancy is
from the World Bank’s HNPStats database.21

6.1. Comparing Results using Macro and Micro Data
To begin, we assess the accuracy of our macro calculations by comparing them to the
detailed micro results we reported earlier. Table 5 shows the comparison, where we
match the macro calculation to the same year used in the micro calculation.
The correlation of log λ (computed for the same year) using macro and micro data
is 0.999. The mean log deviation between the two measures is 0.0007, while the mean
absolute log deviation is 0.0674. Thus on average the macro calculation seems to work
quite well, and the average deviation between the two measures is about 6.7 percent,
much of it explained by the absence of leisure inequality from our macro calculation.
This evidence suggests that calculations using publicly-available multi-country data
sets are potentially informative. With this motivation, the remainder of this section
considers welfare calculations for a broad set of countries using the “macro” approach.

6.2. Results for a Broad Set of Countries
Figure 7 provides an overview of welfare across countries using the macro data. The
top panel plots the welfare measure, λ, against GDP per person for the year 2007 – both
relative to the U.S. As in the micro results, the two measures are very highly correlated,
20
Consumption inequality data are directly available for 68 mostly developing countries. For 49 mostly
rich countries, we infer consumption inequality from inequality in disposable income. When inequality
data are not available, we assign a zero value to the contribution of inequality in our accounting exercise.

Note: Log Ratio denotes the log of the ratio of λ to per capita GDP (US=100). The decomposition applies
to this ratio; that is, it is based on equation (7). The log Ratio is the sum of the last four terms in the table:
the life expectancy effect, the consumption share of GDP, leisure, and inequality. (Of course, the sum does
not hold for the median absolute deviation or the standard deviation.) Sample size is 152 countries, and
regional averages are population weighted.

with a correlation (in logs) above 0.95. At the same time, there are clear departures from
the 45-degree line.
Table 6 summarizes the macro welfare comparisons, which reinforce the key points
from the micro data. First, Western Europe is much closer to the U.S. in welfare than in
income: income levels are about 73 percent of the U.S., while consumption-equivalent
welfare averages 82 percent. Higher life expectancy in Western Europe adds about 13
percent to welfare on average, higher leisure adds 3 percent, and lower consumption
inequality adds 8 percent.
Other regions exhibit the opposite pattern: welfare is systematically lower than income. Lower life expectancy reduces their welfare between 16 and 46 percent. Higher
consumption inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America reduce their welfare
around 10 and 16 percent, respectively. Finally, low consumption shares play an import
role in Western Europe and Coastal Asia, reducing welfare by 13 and 28 percent.
The macro data allows us to look at many more countries. Missing data is sometimes a problem, most often for annual hours per worker and consumption inequality.

WELFARE ACROSS COUNTRIES AND TIME

In these cases, we assign U.S. values to the missing observations so that no correction
to the income measure is made. Table 7 shows welfare levels for a selection of countries
in 2007.22
OECD: The key point we made regarding Western Europe shows up for France, Sweden, Germany, and Japan: all have higher welfare than their incomes suggest, largely
due to higher life expectancy, higher leisure, and lower consumption inequality. Norway stands out as an interesting exception. It receives the usual positive contributions
from these “European” forces. However, these effects are more than offset by Norway’s
extremely low consumption share. This is readily understood in the context of the
North Sea oil discovery: Norway is consuming much less than its current income to
smooth the oil revenues into the future. Ireland shows a related pattern, with its high
investment rate and low consumption share.
East Asia: Differences between welfare and income are also quite stark for East
Asia. According to GDP per person, Singapore and Hong Kong are rich countries on par
with the U.S. The welfare measure substantially alters this picture. Singapore declines
dramatically, from an income 117% of the U.S. to a welfare of just half that at 57%. A
sizable decline also occurs for South Korea, from 58% for income to 45% for welfare.
Both countries, and Japan as well, see their welfare limited sharply by low consumption shares. This force is largest for Singapore, where the consumption share of GDP
is below 0.5. This is the levels analogue of Alwyn Young’s (1992) growth accounting
point. Singapore has sustained a very high investment rate in recent decades. This
capital accumulation raises income and consumption in the long run, but the effect on
consumption is less than the effect on income, which reduces the welfare-to-income
ratio. Leisure is also low in Singapore and South Korea, further reducing welfare relative
to income. Working hard and investing for the future are well-established means of
raising GDP. Nevertheless, these approaches have costs that are not reflected in GDP.
Botswana and South Africa: According to GDP per capita, these are relatively rich
developing countries with about 20% of U.S. income. AIDS, however, has dramatically
reduced their life expectancy to around 52 years, lowering welfare by more than 85 log
points in these countries. Inequality in both countries is also among the highest in
the world, with a standard deviation of log consumption of more than 1.0 – reducing

welfare by more than 33 log points. The combined effect of these changes is to push
welfare substantially below income: both countries have welfare below 5% of that in
the U.S., placing them in the middle of the pack of poor economies.

6.3. Growth Rates
Table 8 reports summary statistics for welfare growth. These statistics enhance our
understanding of Key Point 4 above regarding life expectancy and growth. Western
Europe, the United States, and Latin America all exhibit welfare growth a full percentage
point higher than income growth between 1980 and 2007. The key driving force behind
this faster growth is rising life expectancy, which adds about 1.3 percentage points to
growth in Europe and Latin America and around 0.8 percentage points in the United
States and Coastal Asia. Tragically, Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a much smaller
boost (0.3 percentage points), as discussed further below.
Table 9 illustrates how welfare growth differs from income growth for select countries. Some of the major highlights:
Japan: Despite its “lost decade” after 1990, Japan moves sharply up in the growth
rankings when considering welfare instead of income. Between 1980 and 2007, income

growth in both the U.S. and Japan averaged just over 2.0% per year. But rising life
expectancy, rising consumption relative to GDP, and rising leisure nearly double Japan’s
welfare growth to 4.0% per year, almost a full percentage point faster than U.S. welfare
growth of 3.1% over this period.
AIDS in Africa: Young (2005) pointed out that AIDS was a tragedy in Africa, but
that it might boost GDP per worker by raising capital per worker. Our welfare measure
provides one way of adding these two components together to measure the net cost. As
Young suspected, the net cost proves to be substantial. Botswana loses the equivalent
of 1.1 percentage points of consumption growth from seeing its life expectancy fall from
60.5 to 52.1 years, similar to the loss in South Africa. Botswana’s growth rate falls from
one of the fastest in the world at 6.27% to the much more modest 2.94%. Already poor,
sub-Saharan Africa falls further behind the richest countries from 1980 to 2007, and
more so for welfare than for income.
The new “Singapores”: An important contributor to growth in GDP per person in
many rapidly-growing countries is factor accumulation: increases in investment rates
and in hours worked. This point was emphasized by Young (1992) in his study of Hong
Kong and Singapore. Yet this growth comes at the expense of current consumption and
leisure, so growth in GDP provides an incomplete picture.
Table 9 shows that many of the world’s fastest growing countries are like Singapore
in this respect. In terms of welfare growth, China, Ireland, Hong Kong and Botswana
all lose more than a full percentage point of annual growth to these channels, while
South Korea and India lose more than a half percentage point. These countries remain
among the fastest growing countries in the world, however, as these negative effects are
countered by large gains in life expectancy.

Conclusion

For a given specification of preferences, we calculate consumption-equivalent welfare
for various countries and years using data on consumption, leisure, consumption inequality, leisure inequality, and mortality by age. Our main finding is that cross-country
inequality in welfare is even greater than inequality in incomes. More specifically, our
findings can be summarized as follows:
First, the correlation between our welfare index and income per capita is very high.

38

JONES AND KLENOW

This is because average consumption differs so much across countries and is strongly
correlated with income. Second, living standards in Western Europe are much closer
to those in the United States than it would appear from GDP per capita. Longer lives
with more leisure time and more equal consumption in Western Europe largely offset
their lower average consumption vis a vis the United States. Third, in most developing
economies, welfare is markedly lower than income, due primarily to shorter lives but
also to more inequality. Finally, economic growth in many countries of the world (the
exception being Sub-Saharan Africa) is about 50% faster than previously appreciated, a
boost almost entirely due to declining mortality.
Our calculations entail many strong assumptions. We therefore checked and confirmed robustness to alternative welfare measures and alternative utility functions over
consumption and leisure. With the requisite data, one could relax more of our assumptions. Mortality by age surely differs within countries (e.g. by education). Preferences over consumption and leisure must differ within countries, perhaps mitigating
the welfare cost of unequal outcomes. Where household data is available going back
far enough, one could better estimate the present discounted value of welfare.23
One could carry out similar calculations across geographic regions within countries,
or across subgroups of a country’s population (e.g., by gender or race). Even more
ambitious, but conceivable, would be to try to account for some of the many important
factors we omitted entirely, such as morbidity, the quality of the natural environment,
crime, political freedoms, and intergenerational altruism. We hope our simple measure
proves to be a useful building block for work in this area.

With time-separable utility, repeated cross-sections would suffice. Dealing with nonseparability over
time, however, would seem to require longer household panels than are known to us.
