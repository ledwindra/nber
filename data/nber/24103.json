    "abstract": "\n\nThe behavioral responses to taxes and subsidies are often subject to various behavioral biases and transaction costs\u2014what we define as \u201cmicrofrictions.\u201d We develop a theoretical framework to show how these microfrictions\u2014and their heterogeneity across the population and policy instruments\u2014affect the design of Pigouvian policies. Standard Pigouvian pricing still holds with transaction costs, but requires adjustment with behavioral biases. We use transaction-level data from the US appliance market to estimate the heterogeneous behavioral responses to an array of energy fiscal policies and to quantify microfrictions. We then assess optimal fiscal policies and find that it is rarely optimal to couple a Pigouvian tax on energy with an investment subsidy in this context. We also find that energy labels\u2014intended to increase the salience of energy information\u2014can interact in perverse ways with both taxes and subsidies.\n\n",
