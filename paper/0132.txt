I. INTRODUCTION
The growing likelihood of major health difficulties Is a principal
feature of the aging process and coping with pOor health may be the single

problem which most distinguishes the economic circumstances of older workers
from that of the young. Beyond the direct utility loss of diminished health,
the person In poor health suffers other adverse economic and social consequences, Including a reduction In income as he or she is forced to reallocate

time from market work to health maintenance activities.1 A number of economists,

Grossman and Benham (1974), Johnson and Berkowitz (1974), Scheffler and Iden
(1974), Schwartz (1974), and Luft (1974, 1975), have recently attempted to

quantify the effect of health status on male labor supply and have found, not
surprisingly, that the effects are large Indeed.2
The magnitude of the economic loss for a given severity of illness or
accident depends, of course, on the Institutional structure within which the
individual lives and works. Since the family has traditionally been an Important,
If informal health production organization and source of income insurance, the
role of the family in conditioning the relationship between health, labor

supply, and earnings will be explored in this paper.3 Obviously the interaction of family structure, health status, and labor supply is quite complex
and I focus below only on a few aspects of this issue, largely relating to the
ability of older families to buffer the economic losses imposed by the adult
male's poor health.

The main labor supply questions to be considered are the effect of family
structure on the size of the male's labor force withdrawal for a given health
loss and, for married men, the corresponding sensitivity of the spouse's

—2—

market activity to the male's health condition. The relative size of the
afflicted individual's (and family's) income loss will obviously depend

critically on the size of these labor supply responses. The family structure
of the male will be characterized simply by the presence or absence of a

spouse and the education level of the spouse, if present. Spouse's education
is suggested by several health studies which found it to be an important

determinant of male health.4 In the current paper I explore only the labor
supply consequences of poor health and not wage rate effects, a process complex
enough to require separate study.5

Below I consider the health, family structure, and labor supply inter-

relationships at both a theoretical and empirical level. The paper is organized
in the following way. In Section II, a theoretical model of family time
allocation among market, home, and health activities is developed. The
concept of a family health maintenance function is formalized to generate
qualitative predictions of the effect of wages, health status, health care
efficiency, and property income on the labor supply of husband and wife.
In Section III, data from the older male portion of the National Longitudinal

Surveys are used to estimate labor supply functions for married and single men

with special attention to differences in poor health responses. A simultaneous
model of male labor supply and other family income (chiefly transfer income
and the earnings of the wife) is then estimated to determine whether variations
in the work hours of males, largely due to health differences, induce any
substantial changes in income producing activities by other family members.

Finally, in Section IV the detailed time budget data on both males and females
from the Productive Americans Survey are used to estimate more precisely the

effect of health on total family time allocations. These data provide estimates
of the impact of poor health on home production time as well as market time
for both husband and wife.

—3—

ii. A THEORETICAL MODEL
In this section I develop a formal model of the family's health maintenance

and market time activities to provide a clearer understanding of the behavior

of the family when the male member s in poor health. Before proceeding,
it will be useful to introduce some health concepts. In the analysis below
it is important to distinguish carefully between health status (a stock concept)

and health maintenance activities (a flow concept).6 The individual and
family can only determine, for given current health status, how much time and
other resources to invest in improving health conditions, although obviously
current investments in health improvement will affect later health stocks.
Beyond health investments, two related processes affect health capital stock,

a more or less continuous decline in capacity due to aging and random, discrete

shocks such as disease and accident. The latter are also age dependent as the
probability of such shocks rises with age (after a point) while the potential
for recovery diminishes.

Given these factors, the family can augment the older male's current
health status by allocating his own time to rest, by allocating the time of the
wife to nursing and other personal care activities, and by purchasing medical

goods and services in the market. Two separate but interdependent choices
must be made when the male's health declines; 1) the scale of the health

investment to undertake and ii) the production process to use. The scale of
health Investment will depend on the desire for a higher expected stock of health
in the future and on the cost of a given increment to future expected health
stock..

7

—4—

.
I

assume below that the effect of family structure on time allocation

to work and health maintenance, however, is more likely to be shaped by

substitution between husband and wife than by differences in choice of scale
and so I concentrate on that aspect. It should be born in mind, nevertheless,

that health maintenance scale effects may influence the results. Evidence on
health status (the stock) suggests that scale effects, if they exist, will be
in the direction of larger health maintenance investments for men with highly

educated spouse. In the Appendix to this paper for example it is reported that,
controlling for other factors, the likelihood of older males to be in fair
or poor health is reduced by one percentage point (or about 4 percent since about
25 percent of the sample are in these low health categories) for every additional

year of wife's schooling.8
The nature of the decision maker in the case of poor health also deserves

a short comment. The frequently useful fiction of a family utility function
seems inappropriate in this case since the fundamental individuality of the

family members is quite obvious in matters of health. Direct sharing of the
burden is not possible. The income and home production losses, however, can
and generally are redistributed over the other family members.9 The problem
is simplified in the current analysis since I consider primarily the production

and not the scale decision. I need only assume that the family will produce the
required level of health maintenance in such a way as to yield the maximum
production of other goods.

This section then explores the variation in family time allocations
induced by poor health and how the allocations are influenced by substitution

.

—5—

possibilities within the family. To focus on the interaction of health and
productive hours, the model assumes, first of all, that the leisure time

of husband and wife are fixed. The husband therefore allocates his remaining
fixed quantity of time (T) between market work (T1) and health maintenance

activities (T2). The wife must allocate her total time (t) among market
work Ct1), health maintenance activities for her husband such as nursing services
(t2), and home production (t3), so

(1)

T=T1+T

and

(2)

t=

The level of health maintenance the husband requires in a particular time

period is assumed to be given by the husband's current health status. The
husband's maintenance requirements, therefore, are treated as a constraint

on family time allocation. The maintenance may be produced, however, by
different combinations of inputs according to a health maintenance production

function. The nature of the health maintenance function is, therefore, crucial
to the working of the model. Presumably health maintenance is a function of
rest or the male's own time inputs (T2), nursing services or the time inputs
of the wife (t2), and purchased goods and services such as medicines, doctors,

hospitals, etc. The health maintenance function developed here will ignore the
10

purchased goods inputs and consider only the time inputs of husband and wife.

Of course, caring and nursing services can themselves be purchased in the market

—6—

.
but

the sporadic timing of activity in the nursing function makes transactions

costs high if the "nurse" can't be occupied with leisure and other tasks in the

household. Health maintenance services (M0) can in the present case be described
by the following function:

(3)

M0 =

M(T2,t2)

where presumably MT , M

>

0

and

T
22

it will also be assumed that M

<

Mt

.

In

the analysis below

22
that is,

0 ,
that the marginal product
T2 2
of the time of husband or wife in health maintenance production does not

diminish with more of the respective spouse's time in this activity. It will also
be useful to introduce an efficiency parameter (ci) for wife's maintenance time
so that effective maintenance time (t

=

ot2)

enters the maintenance production

function, equation (3).

Since the level of health maintenance is assumed to be given by the
current health stock, it is natural to assume that the family wants to
maximize its production of home commodities (C) subject to the constraint
on the male's health maintenance. The home commodities are produced by
combining market goods (I) with home production time, indexed by the wife's
time in that activity (t3), so

where 10

For simplicity we shall eliminate T2, t3, and I by substitution using
equations (3), (4), and (5) respectively, which leaves the maximization process

subject to the health maintenance constraint only. The Lagrangean to be
maximized then is

The necessary conditions have straightforward interpretations. Equation (7)
suggests that the husband's time should be split between work and maintenance

so as to equateutilities per unit of time input in both activities. Equations
(8) and (9) suggest comparable equalization of marginal utilities among the

—8—

three time uses available for women (work, husband health maintenance, and home
production). The linkage between optimal male and female time allocations can
be made clearer by combining equat1on (7) and (9) which yields the expression:

(11)

Apparently

the ratio of the marginal products of the two time elements of health

maintenance should be equal to the ratio of efficiency corrected wage rates.

The comparative statics of the time allocation decision can be more completely described by forming the differential system of the set of equations (7)
through (10) and then solving for various derivatives of time allocations with

respect to exogenous variables. The differential system and derivations of
qualitative effects reported below can be obtained from the author. The results
of the calculations of various qualitative restrictions on the corresponding
derivatives are suimnarized in Table 1. A number of the major qualitative
predictions are discussed below.

Necessary Health Maintenance Services (M0)
If the husband's health condition should deteriorate so greater levels
of health maintenance services are required, both husband and wife will shift

additional time into health maintenance services. For the husband this
directly implies a reduction in work in this model. For the wife the
important implication for market time is ambiguous.

The source of the

ambiguity is clear. Her husband's poor health leads her to devote more time to
nursing and care services but, since her husband is simultaneously withdrawing
from the market, the family finds her time in market more valuable than before.

The extent to which market hours increase (decrease) gives some idea of the self—
insurance value of the wife's earning power to the family.

If the amount of

nursing time she can fruitfully undertake is limited, she could be expected

to increase her work time. In any case, the sum of work time plus nursing time
should increase and home production unambiguously decrease.

The implications for the labor supply response of males without spouses

in this model is clear without the elaborate analysis. Since he has no spouse
who may substitute her time in his health maintenance production, single males

are likely to withdraw from the market more than married males. Only if single
men chose to run down their health capital at a faster rate (or improve it
more slowly) than married men would they be likely to withdraw less from the
market.

Wage Rate of the Husband (W)

An increase in the wage rate of the husband leads to a shift from health
maintenance into market work by the husband as the value of his time rises in

the latter activity. The wife adjusts by increasing her health maintenance
time and reducing her market time. Home production of the wife also rises
since home production is restricted to be a normal good in this case and real
income has risei. This time too will be taken from market time.

Wage Rate

of the Wife (w)

The effect of a higher wage for the wife on the husband's time allocation
is to shift the husband out of the market and into health maintenance. The wife's
health maintenance time will, therefore, be reduced. The ambiguity of offsetting income and substitution effects of a wage change on the labor/home
production choice is comparable to the more usual labor/leisure ambiguity.

.

— 11—

The Health Maintenance 'Efficiency' of the Wife (a)
If the wife is more efficient at providing health maintenance services,
the husband will substitute more time in the market for health maintenance.
The wife, however, may not increase her time in providing health maintenance,
indeed, she may reduce it since each unit of time previously used in that

function yields more services. This effect makes predictions about changes in
market work time ambiguous as well, as apparently any increase or decrease in

maintenance time comes from market time. Home production time unambiguously
increases (reflecting again the normal good aspect of this time).
Limitations in the data increase the ambiguity of the predictions yet

further. Wife's wage rate and health maintenance efficiency, for example, are
not directly measurable (at least for all women) and observable characteristics

such as wife's schooling quite likely confound both wage and efficiency effects.
Even if it is assumed that higher wages are likely to shift women more into
the market and that greater health maintenance efficiency is likely to lead
them into a greater nursing and health care role, the sign of the effect of
schooling on market time will depend on which of these opposing forces is
stronger.

III. THE LABOR SUPPLY OF OLDER MALES: EMPIRICAL RESULTS
The theoretical model of the preceding section emphasizes the importance
of empirical work since even the direction of effect of a number of important

characteristics are ambiguous. In this section, data from the older male
cohort (ages 45—59) of the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) will be explored.

The NLS is a national longitudinal survey o the labor market characteristics of four age cohorts of about 5000 persons each?3 The survey is
representative of the U.S. population except for a substantial oversampling

of blacka(30 percent of total). The labor supply behavior of the men and, in
particular, their differential response to poor health will be estimated. The
sensitivity of other income, specifically earned income of other family members
to the work hours of the males is then estimated in a simultaneous framework.
As a benchmark, a standard labor supply model without health variables
with annual work hours as the dependent variable was estimated using the NLS
data.14

The results are reported in Table 2, column 1. Skill variables,

schooling and occupation, have their expected positive effect on hours. A high
school graduate works on average about 220 hours more than a worker who

quit school after sixth grade, although a college graduate works less. A blue
collar occupation (craftsman, operative, etc.) has an independent negative

effect of 300 hours. Poor labor market conditions reduce work hours as one
would expect, as does aging and being black.

The family effects on labor supply are substantial. Married men with spouse
present work almost 140 hours more than other men independent of the spouse's
education level and about 14 additional hours for each year of schooling of the

spouse.

.

A married man whose spouse has attained twelve years of schooling

will, on average, work about 300 more hours than a single man. With each
additional dependent, work hours increase an average of 20 hours per year,
a statistically significant if not absolutely large effect.

The question remains whether these results are biased by the absence of

health stock. In Table 2, column 2 the annual hour regressions are re—
estimated with a set of dummies HG, HF, and HP which equal one if self reported
15

health status is judged to be good, fair, or poor respectively, zero otherwise.

The reference health status is excellent health (HE). The health variables,
particularly the presence of poor health, strongly influence labor supply.

Poor health status, for example, implies a reduction of 1300 hours or 65 percent

of a standard work year of 2000 hours. The explanatory power of the regression
is dramatically increased from an R2 of 0.11 to an

of 0.25.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the estimates of the non—health
variables in column 2 is the apparent lack of bias induced by exclusion of the

health variables. Only the schooling and age coefficients change a statistically
significant magnitude with the introduction of the health measures. Both the
positive schooling effect and the negative aging effect are substantially reduced
with the introduction of health. perhans a predictable result since both are

similarly and strongly related to good health (see ADPendix). Of oarticular
iurnortance here., the effects of the family variables on labor sutrnlv remain

enerallv unchanged, although labor supply is estimated to be somewhat less
closely related to schooling level of the spouse with the health variables
included.

To answer the question of whether married men have a different labor supply

.

—15—

reaction to poor health than do single men, the total sample was separated into

married and single sub—samples and the regression model with health variables
reestimated. The coefficient estimates are reported in Table 2, columns 3 and 4.
The differences in behavior by health status are dramatic with hours
reductions (relative to a base of excellent health) of 34, 172, and 1222 hours
for good, fair, and poor health respectively for married men and 158,391, and

1677 hours for men without spouse present. The differential work hour reduction
of single men then is 124, 219, and 455 hours annual for the three lesser

health categories. In terms of a fraction of a normal work year (2000 hours),
married men in poor health are forced to contract their annual hours in the
market by 61 percent while single men contract their work hours by 84 percent.

Single men can, then, expect to suffer a reduction beyond that of married men
of an additional 23 percent of their original earnings when poor health strikes.

In the context of the theoretical model above, this suggests that the wife's
nursing and care services are a substantial substitute for the husband's time

in the provision of health maintenance services. As a result the married man
can remain more in the market for given health levels.

The interesting question arises whether the "quality" of the wife measured
by her level of education will also affect the degree of labor force withdrawal

of unhealthy married men.16 Theoretically the answer is ambiguous since
schooling is likely to increase the female's efficiency in health maintenance,
implying a reduction in male withdrawal from the market, and also likely to

increase her market wage,with the opposite effect on male labor supply. Regressions
identical to that reported in Table 2, column 3, were run separately for
married men whose spouses had 12 or more years of education and those whose

spouses has less than 12 years of education. The results, not fully reported

—16—

here,

suggest very little difference in male labor supply reduction as

.

men with highly educated wives withdrew 0, 152, and 1169 hours when health
was good, fair, and poor while men with low educated wives withdrew 69, 191, and

1240 hours per year. The maximum difference is never greater than 71 hours per
year or less than two normal weeks.

A Simultaneous Model of Male Work Hours and Other Income
In the analysis above other family income was not included even though
several researchers have found a strong effect of other family income on

male labor supply. Even though male labor supply may be conditioned by other
income sources, other income, particularly transfer income and earned income of
other family members (largely that of the spouse), may depend on the labor

supply of the male. In this subsection I attempt to provide estimates of the
effects of other income on male labor supply and male labor supply on other

income using simultaneous methods. This should allow us to determine whether
the other income of the family conditions labor supply behavior of the male
and, more importantly, whether male labor supply reductions induce increased
earnings by the spouse.

The empirical estimates above indicate that the labor supply (and therefore

earnings) of older males drops sharply with poor health. An important social
question remains, however, of how adequately transfer income and earned income
of other family marnbers compensate for this loss. These estimates should
provide insights into this question as well as providing a useful introduction
to a more complete study of the time allocation responses of the spouse to poor
health in the husband, to be carried out in the next section.

.

—17—

The basic argument for a simultaneous model is that other family income is
likely to affect the labor supply decision of the man, yet transfers (particularly
welfare and unemployment compensation) and earned family income may vary with

the work hours chosen. The simultaneous model, therefore, can be represented
simply as follows:

(12)

H =

f(0I,

X1)

and

(13)

01 = g(H,
X2)

where H

annual work hours, 01 E other family income, and X1, X2

vectors

of exogenous variables. Several researchers have found a strong effect of other
family income on male labor supply. The analysis which follows should provide
some tentative answers as to whether that empirical phenomenon is the result

of simultaneity bias. As the theoretical model suggests, not even the direction
of the change in spouse's earnings in response to health induced work hour

reductions in the husband is known a priori. The spouse may drop out of market
work to increase her nursing and caring time or alternatively may increase her
market time to compensate for the family's income loss.
In the simultaneous model below, total other family Income was divided
into two components, the sum of wealth income and non—work related transfer
payments and the sum of work related transfer income and earned income

—18—

of other family members. The former was assumed to be exogenous to the system
and was initially treated as an explanatory variable in labor supply, although
it was later dropped because it implied positive wealth effects on labor supply.

17

The second sum is assumed to be endogenous in this system and will be called
below simply "other income".

The content of the vectors of exogenous variables X1 and X2 in equations

(12) and (13) remains to be specified before the system can be estimated. The
exogenous variables in the work hours equation have been discussed at length
above; the relationship will be assumed similar to that reported in Table 2.
The exogenous variables in the other income equation presumably include factors

which influence the earning power of the wife (schooling, her health, etc.)
as well as factors likely to affect the size of transfer flows (number of dependents and urban residence).

Turning to the estimation results, one will find the reduced form estimates

of hours and other income reported in Table 3, columns 1 and 2. The estimates
of coefficients in the work hours regression are not much different than the
earlier results reported in Table 2., although the coefficient on one additional

variable, wife's health for married men, is interesting. If the wife has an
activity—limiting health problem, the husband works an average of about 100
hours less than he otherwise would, presumably because he must increase his

home production time. We will consider this issue at greater length in the
next section.

The other income reduced form estimates in column 2 have not been discussed

above and bear closer examination. Other income is substantially higher for
men with healthy, well educated spouses. The significant quadratic form for
wife's schooling in this equation suggests that other income increases at an

increasing

rate with wife's education.. If the wife has an activity—limiting

health problem, other family income is reduced by an average of more than $500.
Other income, however, rises with various indices of poor health in the husband,

presumably due to some combination of welfare and adjustments in other family

earnings. The reasonably small sizes of the health effects on transfers and other
family earnings, under $1000 in the case of poor health in the husband, suggest

that the effect of m1e labor supply on other income is substantial but well
short of fully compensating the workers in poor health. Urban residence
corresponds to about $300 more in other income for the family.

Two stage least square estimates of the structural equations are reported

in Table 3, columns 3 and 4. The coefficient of male hours on other family
income is significant and indicates that other income increases by about $0.75

for every one hour reduction in male hours worked. The coefficient of other
income in the hours equation,however, is insignificant and indeed positive.
Taken at face value these results suggest that male hours affect the earnings
behavior of other family members and the flow of transfer payinents,but them-

selves are not affected by the size of these other income flows. The latter
result, however, must be held with some caution since the instrument used for

other income has an

of only 0.12, suggesting that almost 90% of the varia-

tion in other income has been discarded in the estimation process. The instrument may not be very useful in this case. Most of the other coefficients are
not substantially changed from the reduced form estimates.

To throw some light on the question of whether it is other earned income
or transfer payments that primarily account for the increase in other family
income when male work hours are reduced, the simultaneous estimation was repeated
for married men only and other income limited to other earned family income.

—21—

The reduced form and structural estimates of this modified model are reported

in Table 4. The reduced form equation for other earned income (column 2)
indicates that this income is fairly insensitive to the health status of the

male. Income increases by $130, $235, and $182 as health drops from excellent
to good, fair, and poor respectively.

This implication is confirmed in the structural estimates presented in

columns 3 and 4. Family income has the same anomalous positive impact on male
work hours and male work hours have a negative impact on family income. The
estimated coefficient of hours on other family income, however, is sharply

reduced in magnitude from the preceding model. A loss of one hour worked by
the male is offset by only about $0.23 increase in the earned income of other

family members. Apparently most of the income compensation for health induced
variation in husband work hours results from transfer payments and not from
work hour adjustments of other family members.

Dividing the sample by wife's education (SW

12, SW < 12) and reestirnating

the equations does not materially alter these conclusions (the full results are

not reported here). The insurance value of more highly educated wives is
substantially, if not statistically significantly, above that of less educated

wives. For every reduction of one hour in male work hours, other family earned
income rises by $0.49 for highly educated wives and only $0.14 for less educated

wives with respective t—values of 1.72 and 1.06. While interesting, in neither
case is the effect substantial.

Apparently other family members do not go into the market in a strong and

systematic way when the husband falls ill. This may partially result from the
fixed costs of either entering the market if one does not currently have a job

or of increasing one's hours if one is already in the market. The model of the

preceding section, however, suggests this result might be due to the increased

intrafamily time allocation is pursued in more detail in the next section with
a data set which allows exploration of the behavior of home production hours
as well as market hours.

IV. INTRAFANILY ALLOCATION OF HOURS: HEALTH EFFECTS
The NLS sample of the preceding section unfortunately lacks any information

on the non—market uses of time by household members. In this section I examine
data from the Productive Americans Survey to develop a more complete picture
of the time adjustments families make when husband or wife falls ill or otherwise

becomes physically incapacitated. The Productive Americans Survey is a single
18

survey carried out in early 1965 with observations on 2214 families of all ages.

Although the subsample of families in the older age group under study here is
substantially less in number than the National Longitudinal Survey, the Productive
Americans Survey has the advantage of containing measures of home productive
work hours (cooking, cleaning, household maintenance, etc.) as well as market

work hours for the husband and wife. This obviously allows more complete
consideration of the allocation of hours within families. Although a complete
analysis would require simultaneous estimation°,,these hours decisions, the

statistical work below is somewhat more modest. The estimated equations can
be interpreted as reduced form estimates of the system.
One problem with the Productive American Survey is that the health measures

are less complete. The estimates of general health stock are absent and only
information on the existence of a work limiting health condition is available,

a variable that must be viewed with some caution In a labor supply study. Since
the NLS data contain both types of information, the two are compared In Table 5.

The cross tabulations suggest that while virtually none of the older men in
excellent health have work limiting health and virtually all in poor health do,

the relationship is less clear cut for the other health groups. Indeed of the

individuals who report that health limits their work in some fashion, only

25 percent are in poor health. With that bit of caution in mind let us turn
to the results.

In Table 6, regression results for the market time, home time, and total

productive time of older males are reported. Health measures are limited in
this data to dummies reflecting the presence (or absence) of an activity—

limiting health problem for the husband and wife. In column 1, estimates of
market work effects are reported. Consistent with the results reported in the
preceding section, the husband's own poor health forces a reduction in work

hours of about 700 hours annually. His wife's health problems induce a modest

and statistically insignificant increase in his work hours of about 30 hours

annually. This is inconsistent with the significant and negative coefficient
of wife's health on market hours in the NLS sample (See Table 3, column 1) of
about 115 hours.

The impact of health on the male's home work corresponds with expectations.

The husband's own health status has no effect on his home work hours although
poor health in his wife leads to a statistically significant increase in his

home work hours. On average the husband seems to increase his home work by
about 200 hours when his wife develops a health problem.
The other coefficients are broadly consistent with the earlier results.

Both blacks and blue collar workers work in the market substantially less than
other males, although in the case of blacks this is partially offset by sig-

nificantly higher home production hours. In these estimates, neither schooling
of the husband nor that of the wife have substantial effects on market or home
work hours.

Separating the sample by the schooling of the female (less than twelve
years or greater than or equal to twelve years) did not reveal any major

differences by type of household. Poor health in the male resulted in an annual
work hours withdrawal of 695 hours in low schooling households, 681 in high,

with no significant change in male home work hours. Wife's health difficulties
did induce a somewhat different time allocation by the male in these two groups.

Males with less educated wives tended to increase home work hours by 279 hours

while reducing market hours by 91 hours. Males with more educated wives
increased home hours by only 73 and increased market hours by 207. Only the
result for home time of the husbands of less educated women was statistically
significant however.

—28—

In

.
Table 7 comparable regression results are reported for married

women, 40—64. For married women, poor health involves a reduction in
market hours of about 361 hours annually and no significant change in home

work hours. Total work hours, both market and home, then drop by about
380 hours. The poor health of the husband leads to an increase of about
140 hours in market work and a small and insignificant decrease in home

hours. The latter is made possible, one might conjecture, by the ability
to substitute tasks within home hours ——

e.g.,

nursing for cleaning.

The combined effect of poor health of the husband on total family work

hours is a loss of 560 market hours and unchanged home hours. The effect on
family hours of poor health of the wife is a loss of about 330 market hours

and a gain of 173 home hours. The husband works about 600 hours less in
total when he is ill, the wife about 400 hours less when she is ill. When the
spouse is ill, men increase their work hours and decrease their leisure by
about 200 hours, largely in home production, while women increase their work
hours by about 100 hours, largely in market work.

The influence of non—health variables on female time allocations is worth
considering for its own sake.

Aging here leads to a reduction in market

work but not home work. The schooling of the husband leads to a reduction
in both market and home work for the wife, with the latter effect roughly
twice as large in magnitude, so total work hours drop substantially (about

40 hours per year of schooling of the husband). The wife's schooling on the
other hand leads to a simple shift in hours from the home into the market
of about 40 hours per school year with no change in total hours worked.
The race coefficients are insignificant but seem to suggest black women

work more in the market and more in total than white women. The presence
of children under 18 in the household leads to a large shift out of the
market (160 hours per child), an even larger shift into home production
(240 hours), and a corresponding moderate reduction in leisure (80 hours).

The presence of children under six leads to a moderate shift out of work
and leisure into home production, although the coefficients are insignificant,

largely I suspect because of the small number of women in this older sample
with children under six.

The separation of the sample by wife's education and reestimation of the
wife time regressions reveal an interesting difference in the behavior of
the two groups. The positive market work hour effect of husband's poor health,
noted in the sample as a whole, is solely due to the response of highly

educated wives who increase their work in the market by 270 hours. The less
well educated wives did not increase their market hours at all when the

husband encounters a health difficulty. Whether this differential response
is the result of differential access to the labor market or simply to the
comparative advantage of lower educated wives in health maintenance (of the
husband) is impossible to tell from this data.

S

—31—

V. CONCLUSION
The main objective of this study has been the exploration of the
interrelation of health and the allocation of time within the family.

Particular attention is paid to health effects on the joint labor supply
of husbands and wives and to the differential labor supply responses to

poor health of married and single men. The impact of health on home
production hours of the family is also considered. The results are of more
than academic interest as they give an indication of how well older individuals and families can economically cope with poor health.

At the theoretical level the concept of a health maintenance function is
introduced into a family time allocation model to generate predictions on the

time allocation effect of variation in market and health parameters. It is
argued that wives can substitute their time for their husband's time in his
rehabilitation process, which suggests that married men should devote more
time to market activity than single men of equally poor health as long as

both demand about the same amount of health investment in total. A number
of critical ambiguities arise in the attempt to predict the market behavior

of females when their husbands are in poor health. The wife may withdraw from
the market to care for her ill husband or alternatively enter the market to
compensate for his lost Income depending on the relative efficiency of her

time in each activity. Actually she may even increase time in both activities
at the expense of other home activities. Similar ambiguities arise in
attempting to predict the effect of wife's schooling on the time allocation
decision since it increases health maintenance efficiency as well as market
value.

—32—

.
The empirical analysis of the labor supply of older men (ages 45—59) from
the National Longitudinal Survey demonstrates the importance of health
condition in the choice of annual work hours and the importance of family

structure in conditioning that response. An individual in poor health for
example works, on average, 1300 hours less per year than similarly educated

(and aged) men in excellent health. The work hours reduction in this case
for married men is however 450 hours less annually than for single men (or

more precisely men with no spouse present). Considered from a standard 2000
hour year the decline in annual hours for single men in poor health is
84 percent of a full employment year while only 61 percent for married men.
Since there is no -corresponding fall in the scale of health investment by

married men (indeed there appears to be a rise), the evidence is consistent

with the notion that married men can marshal resources other than their
own time, particularly their wives' time,to augment the health of the male.
This effect is largely independent of the wife's education level.

A simultaneous model of male labor supply and other family income is also
estimated on the NLS data to determine the effect of other family income on

male labor supply and male labor supply on other family income. The models
suggest that other income does not have a substantial effect on labor supply
but that male labor supply has a significant effect on other family income.
Total other income is estimated to increase about $0.75 for each one hour

reduction in work hours of the older male. About two—thirds of this subsidy
comes from social welfare sources, one—third from increased earnings of other

family members. Other family Income increases substantially only in households where the wife has high levels of education.

Finally, in Section IV time budget data from the Productive American Survey
are used to trace out more fully health effects of family time decisions.

—33—

For both husbands and wives, one's own health problems appear to lead to
substantial market time withdrawals (about 700 hours and 350 hours res-

pectively) while home work hours remain unchanged. As one might expect,
illness in one's spouse leads to quite different time allocation responses

as men increase their home production time, women their market work time.
These work time increases appear to come largely from leisure time in both
cases.

Although the results of this paper are themselves interesting, I believe

they represent only the beginning of the investigation of the family as an

informal health service organization. Theoretically the choice of level of
health maintenance must be more completely integrated with choice of technique.
Beyond this theoretical development other aspects in the interrelation of

health, the market, and family structure remain to be explored. A particularly
crucial element that requires further study is the role of wage rate variations
and other productivity effects of poor health in this choice structure)9 A
number of other researchers have found significant racial differences in labor
supply response to poor health so this again may

FOOTNOTES

'Some portion of this loss is no doubt insurable although the problems
of moral havard are likely to be quite large in this situation for all but the
most obvious phyisical difficulties.
2The study by Morgan et al (1962) also remains interesting and useful.
Other economists have examined the determinants of work days due to sickness.
See Newhouse (1970), Silver (1970), and Grossman (1972). Since this measure
is limited to employed persons it is not a very useful measure for severe
health difficulties.
3For one interesting effort to consider this problem from a largely
sociological viewpoint see Nagi and Hadley (1972).

4Grossman (1973), for example, has found in one sample that the health of
an older male is more closely correlated with the education of the wife than
his own education.
5The wage effects of poor health are considered in an interesting piece
by Grossman and Benham (1973).

6Grossman (1972) stresses this distinction. The further distinction made
by Grossman between health maintenance time and sick time is ignored here.
7mis aspect has been ably discussed by Grossman (1972).
8An alternative explanation of this relationship is possible, namely that
healthier males can attract and marry higher quality (educated) females. Since
these results are for older males, ages 45—59, the simultaneity problem is somewhat diminished. The bulk of these individuals are likely to have developed
health problems in the twenty to thirty years since the usual marriage age. See
Benham (1974) and Welch (1974) for a discussion of this issue.
9Relatively stable shares among family members when one suffers some economic
adversity implies the "rents" to the relationship going to the unaffected party
or parties will fall. Presumably increased marital instability might result.
number of researchers including Auster, Leveson, and Sarachek (1969),
Grossman (1972), and Fuchs (1974) have stressed the importance of social
phenomenon —— consumption habits, personal relationships, etc. —— as determinants
of health status, in contrast to narrowly defined medical care.

Note that this home commodity is somewhat different from that used by
Becker since home work time but not leisure are used to produce it. See
Becker (1965).

In the derivation of qualitative predictions from the differential system
generated below, this function is assumed to be additive.

Annual hours were chosen because of interest in measuring roughly an
earnings effect of health. Other researchers have estimated health effects on
labor force participation, weeks worked per year, and hours worked per week.
Both Davis (1972) and Scheffler and Iden (1974) report that weeks worked are
more sensitive to poor health than are hours per week. Burgess and Kingston
(1974) report modestly greater duration of unemployment for workers in poor
health.
15A classic piece by Nagi (1969) compares self reported health condition
with a doctor's opinion and finds a substantial correspondence of the two.
Deviations where systematic are not necessarily in the intuitively predictable
direction.
16

As mentioned earlier Grossman (1973) found wife's schooling to be strongly
related to the health status of one sample of middle—aged man.
17

A complete model would, no doubt, treat assets and asset income as an
endogenous variable.
