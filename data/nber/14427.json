    "abstract": "\n\nImplicit government obligations represent the lion's share of government liabilities in the U.S. and many other countries.  Yet these liabilities are rarely measured, let alone properly adjusted for their risk.  This paper shows, by example, how modern asset pricing can be used to value implicit fiscal debts taking into account their risk properties.  The example is the U.S. Social Security System's net liability to working-age Americans.  Marking this debt to market makes a big difference; its market value is 23 percent larger than the Social Security trustees' valuation method suggests.\n\n",
