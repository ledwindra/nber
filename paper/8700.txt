Asset Prices in the Measurement of Inflation

ABSTRACT
The debate over including asset prices in the construction of an inflation statistic has attracted
renewed attention in recent years. Virtually all of this (and earlier) work on incorporating asset prices into
an aggregate price statistic has been motivated by a presumed, but unidentified transmission mechanism
through which asset prices are leading indicators of inflation at the retail level. In this paper, we take an
alternative, longer-term perspective on the issue and argue that the exclusion of asset prices introduces
an “excluded goods bias” in the computation of the inflation statistic that is of interest to the monetary
authority.
We implement this idea using a relatively modern statistical technique, a dynamic factor index.
This statistical algorithm allows us to see through the excessively “noisy” asset price data that have
frustrated earlier researchers who have attempted to integrate these prices into an aggregate measure. We
find that the failure to include asset prices in the aggregate price statistic has introduced a downward bias
in the U.S. Consumer Price Index on the order of magnitude of roughly ¼ percentage point annually. Of
the three broad assets categories considered here -- equities, bonds, and houses -- we find that the failure
to include housing prices resulted in the largest potential measurement error. This conclusion is also
supported by a cursory look at some cross-country evidence.

1. INTRODUCTION
The debate on the appropriateness of considering asset price movements in the
conduct of monetary policy has attracted much attention in recent years. Some have
suggested that the failure of the Bank of Japan to consider the price behavior of their
asset markets in the 1980s played a contributing role to the economic malaise suffered in
that country during the past ten years.1 More recently in the U.S., rapidly rising prices of
equities and other assets in the late 1990s have heightened concern within the Federal
Reserve System that, despite the relatively modest growth in conventional retail price
measures, inflation prospects had intensified.
Much of the earlier work that has attempted to introduce asset prices into an
aggregate price index has been motivated by a presumed but unspecified transmission
mechanism through which asset prices are leading indicators of a future inflation at the
retail level. However, we find the theoretical and empirical support for this approach
lacking. In this paper, we consider an alternative, longer-term perspective on the
inclusion of assets in an aggregate price statistic.
Our approach combines a relatively old theoretical concept with a modern
statistical technique. We consider the case of asset prices, or more precisely the current
nominal cost of a claim to a future unit of consumption, as a case of “excluded goods
bias”. Such biases are well known in the literature on price statistic construction and can
arise whenever the price index fails to account for a systematic relative price change that
is of relevance to the economic agent. In so doing, we redefine the object of the central

bank from a current cost of living index, to a price index appropriate for the deflation of
nominal permanent income.
We implement this insight with a weighting technique that identifies a common
trend among varied component price data, a dynamic factor approach. This statistical
algorithm allows us to see through the excessively “noisy” data that has frustrated earlier
researchers who have attempted to introduce assets into a price aggregate, including those
weighted solely on expenditure criteria.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin in section two with
a review of the most influential literature on the inclusion of asset prices in aggregate
price measurement. In section three, we provide a simple model of excluded goods bias
and show how the standard atemporal microeconomic derivation of a cost-of-living index
can be extended to an intertemporal setting. Section four presents a series of alternative
aggregation techniques for constructing inflation measures from a combination of prices
of current consumption goods and the prices of assets, including housing, equities and
bonds. We then proceed to a presentation of the dynamic factor approach that is the focal
point of our empirical investigations. In section five, we apply this approach to US data,
and then extend the analysis to a set of international data for eleven other countries.
Section six concludes.
II. ASSET PRICES AND INFLATION MEASUREMENT: A REVIEW
Early work on the inclusion of asset prices in measures of inflation can be traced
to Irving Fisher (1911). Fisher’s intent appears to have been a desire to find a broad
transactions price metric to guide the monetary authority in establishing the price of gold.
That is, he was considering an index number that best reflected the price level as implied

2

by the equation of exchange. But Fisher was always very clear that different problems
necessitated different indexes (broadly differentiated by the comparative places or
comparative times under investigation.) The appropriateness of any index number can
only be evaluated in the context to which it is to be applied.
The idea that asset prices should receive some consideration in the construction of
aggregate price movements remained a largely dormant issue until Armen Alchian and
Benjamin Klein, published their paper “On A Correct Measurement of Inflation" in 1973.
In this work, Alchian and Klein argued that monetary policy should be concerned with
broader measures of prices than those constructed from the income and product accounts
deflators or standard expenditure-weighted indices.
What is the Alchian and Klein argument, and how should we approach the
problem of asset prices and inflation? The following comparison provides an intuitive
explanation of their view, as we interpret it. In the abstract theoretical economies of
graduate microeconomics classes—the economy of Arrow and Debreu—we conceive of
a world in which there is a full set of state-contingent claims -- that is, assets that
represent commitments to deliver and purchase goods and services at all future dates
under all possible circumstances. We can think of these claims as securities, and before
anything starts in our hypothetical world, there is trading that determines all of their
prices. Since all possible futures are considered, everything is settled once and for all in
the initial period. Let us further propose that all transactions occur in money, and so
there are nominal prices (it is a bit complicated to introduce money formally under these

3

sorts of circumstances, but we will not dwell on what is basically a technical problem of
economic theory.)2
Before time begins, we have trading that establishes the current money prices for
the entire set of all possible goods and services to be delivered today and at all dates in
the future. Without changing anything, imagine the same world, but with more money in
it, and compare the two worlds. In the second world nominal prices will be higher, and so
a given amount of money will purchase less of everything -- fewer claims to goods and
services at all dates and in all states of the world. A comparison of prices in these two
worlds would be a measure of the inflation implicit in increasing the quantity of money.
Bringing this all back to Alchian and Klein, they propose that we focus on
measuring the purchasing power of money generally, rather than on prices of current
consumption specifically. Instead of looking at the cost of a particular (carefully
designed) basket of goods and services meant to measure current consumption, as is
typically done by most consumer price indices, they suggest focusing on the current cost
of expected life-time consumption.
There are various uses for such an index, like the deflation of nominal
compensation, which presumably requires us to measure not only the price of current
expenditures but also prices on current claims to expenditures in a future date (a utilitybased saving concept). Further, as we will discuss in section four, the exclusion of prices
for current claims on future expenditure may distort the interpretation of a current
expenditure price index by a monetary authority that hopes to avoid imbalances between

The simplest way to put in money is to assume that money is distributed by a government that then
requires money payments on some future date. For example, there could be taxes that must be paid in
government-supplied money.

the growth rate of the money stock and the trend growth in expected output—monetary
inflation.
Over the past decade or so, the Alchian and Klein's argument has been critically
examined by academic and central bank economists. A theoretical basis for the claim that
asset prices can be used to help measure inflation has been provided by Robert Pollack
(1989), while Shibuya (1992), Wynne (1994), Shiratsuka (1999), Flemming (1999) and
Goodhart and Hofmann (2000) have done empirical work.
This work has been of two types. In the first, researchers have sought to
operationalize Pollack's concept of an intertemporal cost-of-living index (ICOLI), and
measure the changes in the cost of claims, at current prices, to a consumption basket that
yields a fixed level of lifetime utility. The second strand of the literature examines
whether the current price of assets can help predict future movements in the more
conventional indices.
III. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF EXCLUDED GOODS BIAS
For clarity in exposition, it is useful to begin with the following simple one-period
static model with two goods. Assume that utility is Cobb-Douglas, and so
U # C1! C 2(1"! ) .

(1)

P1C1 $ P2 C 2 # W .

(2)

P1 * ! ' C 2

The budget constraint is

Utility maximization implies that

We can show that the constant-utility price index is also Cobb-Douglas, and so

5

P # P1! P2(1"! )

(4)

These are equilibrium prices when C1 and C 2 are equilibrium quantities.
Assume that C1 and C 2 are produced from labor inputs, and that
C2
# +.
C1

(5)

We are interested in studying the consequences of + to + , . It is simple to show that
following the change in + , the new prices are related to the old prices as
* P1, ' + , * P2, '
(( %% # (( %% .
) P1 & + ) P2 &

(6)

Now we wish to measure the change in the aggregate price index, which will be
P , ( P1,)! ( P2, ) (1"! ) * P1, '
#
# (( %%
P
P1! P2(1"! )
) P1 &

!

* P2, '
(( %%
) P2 &

(1"! )

(7)

Using (6) we obtain,
P , * P1, '* + '
# ( %( %
P () P1 %&() + , %&

(1"! )

.

(8)

Looking at this equation we see that if we are trying to measure the change in the
properly constructed constant-utility aggregate price index, and instead we measure only
*+'
the change in P1 , then we will have a price index biased by a factor of (( %%
) +,&

(1"! )

. This is

the excluded goods bias.
We could include a change in nominal income, W as well. This would be an
increase to
W , # -W .
Such a change is neutral, in the sense that both prices rise by a factor of - .
6

(9)

To see how this works, we introduce this common price change into the problem.
Assume that prices after the influx of money and the relative price change are
P1* # -P1,

(10)

P2* # -P2,

(11)

This formulation allows us to immediately disentangle the relative price change from the
one that comes from the increase in nominal wages. It is important to keep in mind that
the aggregate price index will not change by - as + . + , . But without a relative price
change, then we expect to measure inflation as - .
We now wish to examine the price index
P * * P1* '

(12)

Which gives us
* P, '* + '

Now, normalizing

correctly measured inflation is

but ignoring the second good gives us - .
Our conclusion is that the difficulty arises from a change in

between the two goods, ! .
Of course, the intertemporal problem is exactly the same. To formulate it, we
would simply assume that people live two periods, working and consuming when young
and only consuming when old. The young work and are paid a nominal wage, W for
their one unit of inelastically supplied labor. They take their money and purchase both
goods for current consumption and claims on goods for future consumption. That is, they
expend all of their monetary income when they are young. 3
A change in the price of future consumption relative (P2) to the price of current
consumption (P1) is caused by a change in output in one period relative to that in the
other. This is + , the ratio of C2 to C1. We note that in the context of this very simple
intertermporal model, this price ratio P2/ P1 is the real interest rate, and that changes in the
real interest rate come from technological changes that change the growth rate of output
ρ.
In addition to changes in relative prices, we can also introduce a form of “pure”
inflation that arises from increasing the monetary wage W that is paid to workers when
they are young. In this very simple formulation, we can think of increases in nominal
wages as analogous to increases in the money stock. Aggregate inflation enters through
the parameter γ.
Looking back at equation (13) we can see the proper change in the (utility-based)
price index depends on several things. First, there is the change the current price of
3

The Cobb-Douglas utility function is analogous to a log-linear utility function with a discount factor
equal to (1-α)/α. It is easier algebraically to retain the Cobb-Douglas form, and so we continue with it.

current consumption. But the index also depends on the change in the current price of
next period’s consumption. In this simple formulation, the dependence on the prices of
claims to future goods and services shows up as a change in the growth rate of
consumption. Ignoring the second term, the ratio of ρ to ρ’ creates a bias in the measure
of inflation.
How big a problem do we face if we ignore current claims on future
consumption? First, notice that there is a bias only when the growth rate of consumption
changes. This is what creates the relative price movement that precipitates the excluded
goods bias. But even so, the problem could conceivably be large.

If we think of this

two-period model as covering a lifetime, then the time periods must be rather long. For
this example, we take a period to be 35 years. If consumption grows at 2% per year,
approximately the growth rate of per capital U.S. GDP, then + is a number like

+ # 1.02 35 # 2 . Consider a case in which this rises by one-half on one percentage point to
+ ' # 1.02535 # 2.37 .
Next, we need an estimate of ! , the importance of the first period consumption in
utility. Assuming an annual discount factor of 0.98 and two 35-year periods, the
approximate weight on consumption in the first 35-year period is approximately onethird. This means that our measure of inflation, at the time of the permanent change in
economic growth, is off by a factor of 0.893, and so inflation is overestimated by 10.7%.
Granted that this is for a 35 year period, but the potential error seems very large.

IV-1. INTEGRATING ASSET PRICES INTO A PRICE INDEX: EXPENDITURE
WEIGHT APPROACHES
The identification of a potentially large excluded goods bias in a price index
suggests an obvious solution—include the omitted prices in the aggregate price
calculation. Unfortunately, data on the price of contingent claims to future consumption
do not usually exist. This has prevented the exact implementation of the original Alchian
and Klein proposal. In more recent work, both Pollack and Shibuya demonstrate how,
under straightforward circumstances, an intertemporal cost of living index (ICOLI) can
be constructed by using the current prices of existing assets (which are claims on future
consumption) in place of the theoretically appropriate Arrow-Debreu contingent claims
prices that are not extant in the real world.
As Shibuya notes, the construction of an ICOLI will necessarily put the bulk of
the weight in the price index on future consumption, and thus on asset prices. The reason
for this is very straightforward. The intertemporal index is constructed from the present
value of the sum of future consumption. Ignoring changes in consumption over time, and
assuming that the rate of time discount is about 3%, current consumption is only one part
in about 33, and so the weight on asset prices (claims to future consumption) will be
97%, while that on current consumption prices will be 3%.4
In Shiratsuka's application to the case of Japan, the weight of 97% on asset prices
implies that there was both much higher inflation in Japan in the 1980s, and much
worse deflation in the 1990s, than shown in the standard measures of consumer prices—
implicitly suggesting that monetary policy was initially too expansionary, and later

4

The rule-of-thumb for such a calculation is that the weight on the index of current consumption prices will
be approximately equal to the rate of time discount.

10

too contractionary. But the high weight accorded asset prices, and the implicit policy
prescription, results in the recommendation that policymakers target asset prices.
But there are shortcomings to this interpretation of Alchian and Klein. Bond
markets facilitate the transformation of current money into future money, and so if
monetary policy stabilizes the price of current consumption over time, it makes
intertemporal exchange of goods predictable as well. A policy that controls the time path
of the terms of trade between current money and current consumption, together with
nominal bonds that allow the transformation of current into future money, stabilizes the
price of lifetime consumption, and so no further information is needed.
Indeed, there is a fundamental confusion that pervades much of the discussion of
the inclusion asset prices in measures of inflation that concerns that idea that asset price
movements somehow give information about future inflation. The claim is that an asset
price will increase in anticipation of future goods price increases. If this occurs while
current goods prices are stable, then a central bank that only targets current consumption
flow prices will fail to respond adequately to stabilize future goods prices.
This is the argument that has led both Shiratsuka and Goodhart and Hofmann
focus attention on the ability of current prices of assets, including residential property and
share prices, to forecast movements in conventionally measured consumer price inflation
several years ahead.
While there is empirical evidence to suggest that increases in asset prices may
help foretell a future inflation at the retail level (albeit marginally), the theoretical
mechanism for such a finding must be an indirect one whereby increases in aggregate
demand outstrip those of aggregate supply. It is not the case that increases in equity

11

prices themselves are a sign that market participants have increased their forecast of
future consumer price inflation.
To see why this is so, carefully consider the determinants of asset prices. In the
absence of bubbles, the price of assets is the present discounted value of the stream of
goods or services that come from owning it—the dividend or earnings flow. If we
measure the future value of the dividend in current dollars, then we would discount the
stream using the real rate of interest. If prices were measured in future dollars, then we
would need to use the nominal rate of interest. But in either case, changes in the path of
future inflation leave the level of the asset price unaffected, and so fluctuations in asset
prices must come from other sources. Surely, increases in the current price of an asset can
affect inflation through the wealth effect on consumption, but this macroeconomic
mechanism has nothing to do with asset prices being signals of future inflation.5
Alternatively, our interpretation of Alchian and Klein is based on a related article
by Tullock (1979) who describes the case of an excluded goods bias in the event of a
hypothetical “diamond rush” where the cost of living appears to be exceptionally high
when judged by the rapid rise in the price of current consumables. And in fact, if we are
considering the question, “what are the costs associated with current consumption
compared to the pre-rush era?,” then this narrowly defined market basket of price ratios
may be the appropriate statistic.
However, if we are concerned with the question, “What is the real wage of
diamond-mine laborers?,” this market basket may be especially misleading. Indeed,
judged only by the current cost of living, the real wage of labor may easily appear to be

5

Flemming’s (1999) suggestion that the central bank's inflation target be based, in part, on the fluctuation
in the nominal price of an index bond follows directly from such reasoning.

12

falling dramatically as the demand for current consumables surges due to their higher
demand. The missing price, in this example, is the exceptionally low priced un-mined
diamond assets which, once included in the appropriately constructed price index, reveal
the rapidly rising real wage of labor that gave rise to the diamond rush to begin with.

IV-2. INTEGRATING ASSET PRICES INTO A PRICE INDEX: A SIGNALEXTRACTION APPROACH
Returning to the issue of how we might employ asset prices in the measurement
of current inflation and the purchasing power of money, consider the simplest possible
case of what we will call pure inflation. Pure inflation is the case in which there
are no relative price changes -- it is as if we were to wake up one morning and
suddenly all nominal quantities have been multiplied by some factor. If all prices
change proportionally, then measurement of inflation is trivial, as we can look at
any individual price and it is a perfect indicator of what happened to all prices.
That is to say, we could compute the amount of inflation by looking at the price of
houses, equities, restaurant meals, or chewing gum. It simply would not matter.6
In fact, measuring the change in the purchasing power of money would simply
require that we measure the change in a single price. Unfortunately, real life is not quite
so simple, and inflation tends to come with relative price changes as well. These changes
in the nominal price of one product relative to another are caused either by changes in
technology or in tastes, and they are entirely real. In measuring inflation, the goal is to get
rid of these by finding a set of prices in which they cancel out.

6

The possible existence of nominal bonds complicates this example somewhat, and so we will ignore them
for the time being.

13

We can appeal to earlier work of Bryan and Cecchetti (1993) for a simple
framework to understand the problem. Using their simple intuition, we can think of the
inflation in the price of all goods, services and assets today as having
a common and idiosyncratic component. In symbols:

/ it # / t $ xit

(15)

where i indexes the set of goods, services or assets, and t is time. We can think of an
inflation index as a weighting together of these individual inflation measures. If we
have a set of weights, this would be:
P!t # 0 wit / it

(16)

i

where the weights are the wit and can change over time, but have the property that
at any given time they sum to one. That is

0w

it

# 11t

(17)

i

Using this fact, we can now rewrite the price index
P!t # / t $ 0 wit xit

(18)

i

Since our goal is the measurement of the common trend in all prices, we are
trying to find a set of goods, services and assets where the (weighted) relative changes
cancel out. These relative changes will cancel out, however, only in the case where there
exists a complete set of prices. In the case of the excluded goods bias discussed earlier,
such that relative price adjustments produce a non-zero sum, this measurement error will
be imbedded in the common inflation signal ( / t ) in equation (18). For the purposes of
this investigation, this relative price change is created by the intertemporal substitution
between current and future consumption induced by a change in the real interest rate.
14

During periods when the real interest rate has declined, real current prices of current
consumption fall relative to real current claims on future consumption, causing any
aggregate price measure (regardless of weighting technology) based only on current
consumption prices to be too high.
Bryan and Cecchetti (1993) refer to the index / t as a dynamic factor index (DFI).
It is derived from the joint statistical properties of a price series, rather than from
consumer theory. As such, it is a very different implementation of the intertemporal costof-living index discussed by Alchain and Klein, and formalized Pollack and implemented
by Shibuya. Instead, it is a direct measure of the purchasing power of money based on the
intuition provided by Goodhart (1999).
But once we formulate the problem in this way, we can see that the issue of
weighting any given nominal price is an empirical one, having to do with their
informativeness about the common trend. If, for example, we knew that the price
of a particular variety of shoes never experienced any relative price changes, then we
could save government statistical agencies quite a bit of money.
Alternatively, if there were only two goods in the economy, and they experienced
substantial relative price shocks, and then focusing attention on one price alone, rather
than a properly constructed average, could be misleading. Starting with a set of prices
that includes asset prices, we can ask whether their inclusion adds any information to our
estimate of the common trend?
IV-3. INTERGRATING ASSET PRICES INTO A PRICE INDEX: A DYNAMIC
FACTOR INDEX APPROACH
The decision as to whether asset prices should be included when measuring
inflation depends, therefore, on how informative they are about measuring the common
15

price growth trend. From the simple framework outlined in the previous section, we can
see that this is reflected in the weight given to various asset prices in the construction of
the common index. Building upon this framework, we write the model as
.

.

.

pit # / t $ x it
.

4 ( L) / t # 3 $ 2 t
.

6 i ( L) x it # 5it
.

.

(19)

(20)

(21)

.

where pit , / t , and x it are the first differences of the logs of the observed variables, the
common unobserved component representing inflation and the idiosyncratic relative price
movement in the ith series, respectively. ψ(L) and θi(L) are vectors of lag polynomials
and ξt and ηt are i.i.d. random variables. Throughout, it is assumed that both the
.

common element, / t , and the idiosyncratic components, xit can be modeled as AR(2)
processes.
The main identifying assumption of the model is that the common component and
the idiosyncratic components are mutually uncorrelated at all leads and lags. This is
achieved by assuming that θ(L) is diagonal and that all the error terms in the model are
mutually uncorrelated. This is consistent with the notion that the common component
captures all the comovement in the observed series, leaving xit to reflect only
.

idiosyncratic movements. To set the scale of / t , the variance of ξt is normalized to one.
The parameters of the model are then estimated via maximum likelihood using the
Kalman filter. As a by-product, the Kalman filter recursively constructs MMSE

16

.

estimates of the unobserved components / t and xit given observations of pit. The
common index can be written as a linear component of current and past values of the
observed series
^

^

.

/ t # 0 w i ( L) pit

(22)

i

It is these weights that are implicitly used to construct the common component
that are of primary interest in this context, as it is on the basis of these weights the
question of whether asset prices should be included when measuring inflation can be
assessed. In a perfect world, this model should yield the weights as described in equation
7 of the theoretical model, ! and 1 " ! .
In an alternative approach to this “signal-extraction” problem, Wynne (2000)
describes the implementation of a simple variance-weighted price index where
1
72
wi # N i
1
0
2
i #1 7 i

(23)

for all of the series in the data where 7 i2 is the variance of the rate of change in the price
of good i.
A simple variance-weighting scheme of this type is a good indicator of the likely
importance of a particular series in the construction of more complex (and difficult to
compute) dynamic factor indices. To see why, note that the variance of the “common”
element in any scheme, similar to that describe in equation (23) above, will have the
property that the estimated inflation index will have variance equal to or less than the
variance of the least volatile component used. As a result, the variance-weights derived
17

from (23) will give an indication of the likely importance of each series in constructing
measures of inflation.
V.1 RESULTS: THE CASE OF THE UNITED STATES
To evaluate the importance of asset prices in the construction of a DFI measure of
inflation for the US, monthly data on house, stock and bond prices were examined in
conjunction with CPI component series at varying levels of aggregation. The first
approach looked at the traditional measure of “core” inflation – CPI excluding food and
energy. Individual series for food and energy were also included along with the three
asset price series. The implicit weights for the constituent series were extracted by
computing the response of the common component to unit impulses in each of the series.
Weights were also calculated based on the variances of the observed series for
comparative purposes (as described by equation 23.) This static version of the model
attributes a weight to a series based solely on the inverse of its variance, ignoring the time
series properties of the data.
The weights that resulted from these experiments are reported in table 1. First,
we note the relative weights assigned to the three CPI components as derived by the DFI
model without asset prices (column 2) relative to the expenditure weights given these
components in the actual CPI (column 1.) Energy prices were assigned a
disproportionately small weight (4.4%) compared to its expenditure weight (7%). This
seems to support the common finding that energy prices are excluded from most
commonly accepted measures of “core” retail price inflation. On the other hand, food
prices appear to have a reasonably strong common inflation signal, suggesting that their
exclusion from a price index may not be entirely justified.

Turning to the influence of asset prices, we computed the common DFI index first
with all three asset-price series included, then we proceeded to drop alternative series in
order to gauge the impact on the weights attributed to the remaining series. Focusing
first on column 3 where all three asset-price series are included, it is evident that housing
is the asset price series that conveys the most information about the common trend in
prices. Indeed, at this level of aggregation, the housing price index would appear to have
a disproportionately large weight attached to it (20.5%), according to the statistical model
we apply.
When evaluating the weights, remember that the strength of the common price
signal in any particular component should be judged against the case where its signal-tonoise quality is identical to the average price component, 1/n, where n is the number of
component prices included in the statistic’s calculation. In the case of table 1, column 1,
this is approximately 17%. The signal to noise ratio for equities and bonds was
considerably less than this benchmark, with DFI weights of 4.5% and 2.4%, respectively.
As a general observation then, these asset price components (like energy prices) are
exceptionally “noisy” in the sense that their idiosyncratic behavior reduces their
usefulness in the estimation of a common inflation trend.
Indeed, the highly variable nature of certain asset prices has generally undone any
practical implementation of a broader price index that includes asset prices. This quality
in the data is suggested by the very small weights attached to equity and bond prices
resulting from the variance weighting approach (0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.) But
despite the relatively high variance of the housing price series (resulting in a variance

19

weight of only 0.3%), the common inflation signal contained in this asset appears to be
exceptionally strong.
In our approach, this finding is not particularly surprising. Every asset is
composed of a large number of particular characteristics. Equity prices, for example,
represents claims to an increasing quantity of future consumption, tantamount to a
substantial quality bias in the price measure. Although a similar complaint can be made
for the housing data (which do not hold constant the characteristics or amenities of the
housing stock, or make adjustments for changes in tax treatment), housing is more
analogous to a real consol, the appropriate asset price in our theoretical treatment.
We disaggregated further the CPI on the basis of its nine major component
groupings, recomputed the DFI’s for every possible combination of assets and examined
the resulting component weights (table 2).7 At this level of disaggregation, the weight
attached to housing prices falls sharply (to 3%), although taken together with the housing
services index in the CPI, the total housing component of the index commands a weight
of about 14 percent. These weights stay roughly the same when the other asset price
series are omitted. In contrast, zero-coupon bond prices are relatively uninformative,
attracting small weights in all three cases. The weights attributed to stock prices are
consistently higher than those for bonds but are nonetheless somewhat small in all cases.
Nevertheless, each of these assets is assigned a substantially larger weight in our
statistical model than suggested by the variance weights. Cumulatively, the variance
7

The CPI data used are based, where possible, on the methodologically consistent research series (CPI-URS) published by the BLS and are seasonally adjusted where appropriate. The inclusion of nine
components at the group level breakdown reflects the need to accommodate changes to the group structure
by the BLS in 1997. The data series range from December 1977 to December 1999. Two of the relative
price series at the 9-series level of disaggregation have roots close to 1, indicating that the standard errors
around the DFI may be very large.

20

weights suggest giving this combination of assets less than ¼ percentage point weight in
the price index, compared with about a 4½ percent weight in the DFI. Again, this
highlights the importance of considering the time-series properties of the data in
allocating weights.8
Finally, the DFI weights attributed to the components of the CPI and the
expenditure-based weights actually used in the construction of the CPI stand in sharp
contrast. Price series with disproportionately large service (or wage) components, such
as medical care, recreation, and education, receive much higher weight in the DFI than in
the CPI, highlighting the difference between the traditional cost-of-living approach to
inflation measurement and this more statistically-based measure. (Experiments using a
more finely disaggregated CPI are reported in Appendix table 4, although these
experiments do not materially alter our interpretation of the results.)
How much do the inflation measures using asset prices differ from conventional
headline and “core” CPI indices of inflation? We answer this question by examining the
time-series themselves. In table 3, we report the annualized growth trends in the various
inflation estimates (using the nine-component CPI data) over periods of varying length,
full sample (January 1978 to December 1999), the most recent ten years, and the most
recent five years.
The long-term growth differential between the inflation measures is somewhat
small. When all three assets are included in the DFI, the annualized 22-year growth trend
is 4.6 percent—0.4 percentage points above the CPI, and 0.2 percentage points above the

8

We note the fact that the variance weight on house prices increases when longer horizons than one-month
differences are looked at, and may reflect some of the same influences. The larger weight attributed in
house prices in Cecchetti et al (2000) at least partly reflects the use in that paper of quarterly data.

21

CPI excluding food and energy and the median CPI. These suggest that a bias does
indeed exist from failing to include asset prices in the price data, although the order of
magnitude is about ¼ percentage point annually.
Over shorter horizons, such as ten-year and five-year periods, the differences
were a bit higher. Between 1989 and 1999, we find that the exclusion of asset prices
reduced the measurement of inflation by about 0.3 to 0.4 percent annually (3.32 percent
for the DFI including all three asset categories, vs. 2.89 percent for the DFI without
assets, and 2.82 for the CPI excluding food and energy.) For the most recent five-year
period, the inflation differentials were slightly higher still, although only in the instances
where equity prices were included in the index.
That these measures of inflation can yield different inflation trends can be seen in
the year-to-year growth trends reproduced in figures 1-4. The most striking difference is
seen in figure 1, between the commonly reported CPI (research series, CPI-rs) and the
other indexes, such as the CPI excluding food and energy (CPIXFE), the median CPI,
and the DFI without assets (DFI-none).9 Note that the CPI rose substantially above the
other inflation indexes during the late 1970s, but was well below the other measured
inflation trends during the 1980s. This is due to the singular impact on the inflation
estimate coming from energy prices. In all three of the alternative inflation measures, the
statistic is designed to limit the influence of such idiosyncratic occurrences.10
In figure 2, we show the inflation patterns of the benchmark CPIXFE and the DFI
computed using all three asset categories (DFI-hsb). In the early 1980s, the “core” retail

inflation statistic reveals substantially greater inflation than the asset-based DFI. Since
1987, however, the DFI with assets has tended to run somewhat higher than the CPI
excluding food and energy. This impression changes only marginally when different
asset combinations are used in the construction of the DFI (figures 3 and 4.)
Finally, consider the impression one gets of the growth in real nominal
compensation in the U.S. by deflating nominal compensation with each of these price
statistics (8-quarter growth trend shown.) In the base case (shown in figure 5), the real
compensation per hour series computed by deflating with the CPI shows much less real
growth as a consequence of higher energy prices. Including asset prices (figure 6) yields
the result that real compensation growth in the U.S. since 1985 has been somewhat less
than that reported using the more conventional retail price data. Again, these patterns are
only marginally influenced by varying the combinations of asset prices included in the
computation of the DFI (figures 7 and 8.)
V.2: THE RESULTS: A CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISON
To further assess the role of asset prices in measuring inflation, both DFI and
variance-based weights were calculated using a data set for twelve countries complied by
Goodhart and Hofmann (2000). Quarterly data beginning in December 1977 on
aggregate CPI, house prices and stock prices for each country were examined11. The
DFI weights are illustrated in figure 9 while figure 10 shows the weights calculated using
the static variance-based approach.

11

The data series for most countries were quarterly observations from December 1977 to December 1997.
Data for Canada and Finland start in March 1980 and that for France starts in June 1980. Japanese data are
semi-annual and span June 1957 to December 1997.

23

Several things are worth noting from these charts. First, the DFI approach
attributed significant weights to house prices in every country and, with one exception,
the weight on house prices exceeded that on stock prices. In fact, in several cases, the
weight attributed to house prices is larger that that attributed to the CPI. This may
indicate a need to disaggregate the CPI series to capture more of the statistical properties
of the constituent series. As in the US case, the weights for asset prices using the DFI
method were much higher than those based on the variance approach. As mentioned
above, the variance weights on asset prices for the US are higher here with the quarterly
data than they were when monthly data were used.
Observations by nation also reveal some interesting patterns. In Japan, both
house and equity prices received nearly identical shares—the informational content in
assets is about the same as the current consumption price index. The inflation “signal” in
these markets is roughly comparable. In Canada, Ireland, and the Netherlands, housing
prices provide a dominant share of the common factor weight—an exceptionally strong
signal—while in France, the U.K., and most Scandinavian countries, the inflation signal
coming from asset prices, including housing, is somewhat small.
Further, the trend growth differentials of the dynamic factor index and the CPI
also suggest rather large differences by nation. The largest inflation trend differential
(1980-1997) was found for the U.K. (5.2% CPI versus 8.4% for the DFI.) The smallest
differential is in the Netherlands (0.4% annually.) However, in general, the international
data appears to support the findings of the US analysis that there may be a potentially
large role for house prices in the inflation measures of interest to the central bank. Every

24

one of the DFI indexes showed a higher trend inflation than the more narrowly defined
retail CPIs.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have presented an integrated framework for including asset prices in
constructing current inflation and our results suggest that asset prices can affect the
measurement of aggregate price movements. This is particularly true of housing prices,
which appear to play a significant role in the measurement of the inflation trend both in
the U.S. and abroad. As a consequence, the Dynamic Factor Index measures that include
asset prices indicate that inflation has been somewhat higher than other measures would
suggest in recent times.
A key question, then, is to ask how policy would have been different had it been
based on these measures. Any attempt to estimate this would need to take account of the
fact that history changes each time new data are added to this model and so only real-time
information should be used. Overall, however, other simpler measures of “core”
inflation such as the ex-food and energy approach seem to mirror the movements in the
DFI somewhat closely and as such, the inclusion of assets may not have produced
dramatically different real-time policy responses. Indeed, much of the focus on asset
prices appears to be on the unusual and somewhat dramatic run-up in certain asset prices
in recent years. In our approach, which minimizes any idiosyncratic movement in
component price data, we are led to the conclusion that such asset price movements
contained relatively little information of a common inflation that is useful for month-tomonth, or perhaps even year-to-year monetary policy choices.

25

Nevertheless, failure to include asset prices appears to induce a bias in the
estimate of the inflation trend that may have an impact on our understanding of the
broader movements in real economic variables, such as labor compensation. Such
information is very likely to be important in a world where the monetary authority hopes
to eliminate the movements in the aggregate price level that may enter into the
decisionmaking of households.
As a final caveat, we also note that the results reported in this work indicate that
the weights attributed to the various component series seem to be somewhat sensitive to
the level of disaggregation. On the premise that the greater the level of diaggregation, the
more information we get, a further breakdown of some key groups such as housing may
be helpful. In light of this, it may be useful to decompose the international CPI series
where possible to see the magnitude of this aggregation effect.
