INCOME INEQUALITY AND
ThE INCOMES OF VERY
HIGH INCOME TAXPAYERS:
EVIDENCE FROM TAX RETURNS

ABSTRACT
This paper uses tax return data for the period 195 1-1990 to investigate the rising share

of adjusted gross income (AOl) that is reported on very high income tax returns. We find that
most of the increase in the share of AOL reported by high-income taxpayers is due to an increase

in reported income for the one quarter of one percent of taxpayers with the highest AGIs. The

share of total AOl reported by these taxpayers rose slowly in the early 1980s, and increased
sharply in 1987 and 1988. This pattern suggests that at least part of the increase in the income
share of high-AOl taxpayers was due to the changing tax incentives that were enacted in the 1986

Tax Reform Act. By lowering marginal tax rates on top-income households from 50% to 28%,
TRA86 reduced the incentive for these households to engage in tax avoidance activities. We also

find substantial differences in the growth of the income share of the highest one quarter of one
percent of taxpayers, and the share of other very high income taxpayers. This suggests that the

increasing inequality of reported incomes at very high levels may not be driven by the same
factors that have generated widening wage inequality throughout the income distribution and over

a longer time period.

The evolution of the U.S. income distribution has recently attracted
enormous academic and popular attention. Systematic studies of labor earnings
based on large household surveys, such as Bound and Johnson (1992), Katz and
Murphy (1992) ,

Levy and Michel (1991), and Murphy and Welch (1992), have

demonstrated that labor earnings, the most important component of income for
all but the highest—income households, became more unequal during the 1980a.

The returns to college education rose, and the real earnings of low—skill
individuals declined relative to those of better—trained workers.

The most controversial feature of the income distribution, however, is
the apparent increase in the share of income accruing to a small group of very
high—income households: those in the top one percent of the income

distribution. A widely—publicized calculation, described in Krugman (1992),
suggests that very high income households have recently received a
disproportionate share of the real income growth in the U.S. economy during
the last decade.

Measuring the income and wealth of high—income households is extremely
difficult. The economic lives of the rich, especially the rich who are not
famous, are something of a mystery. Mandel (1992) estimates that there are
only a few thousand highly—visible, highly—compensated individuals in the U.S.

economy —

athletes,

top executives at large companies, and partners at major

law firms and investment banks. Various sources suggest that the compensation
received by these individuals rose rapidly during the last decade. Yet
whether the experiences of this group generalize to the nearly one million
households in the top one percent of the income distribution remains an open
question. Information from income tax returns remains the most reliable, if
imperfect, source of information about the economic activities of this group.

2

One cless of explanations for the apparent inorease in the relative
incomes of high— vs. low—income households focuses on chsnges in economic
institutions or structure that might raise wages or cepital incomes for the

high—income group. Slemrod (1992) argues that increasing globalization of
economic activity may raise the incomes of high—ability individuals by more

than that of the less able. The rise of new financial institutions and
practices during the last fifteen years, for example takeovers and leveraged

buy—outs, may also have expended the opportunities for a small group of
individuals to earn very high incomes.

An alternative explanation for the growth of reported income inequality
focuses on changes in taxpayer incentives to report taxable income, rather

than deferring recognition of or otherwise sheltering income. Since high—
income households derive more of their income from capital gains and self—
employment income than households elsewhere in the income distribution, they

ate likely to have mote opportunity to engage in legal tax avoidance, and more
discretion in dociding how, and how much, of their income is reported to the

IRS, than their lower—income counterparts. The tax reforms of 1981 and 1986
lowered marginal tax rates on high—income households, reducing their
incentives to defer taxable income, to transform earnings into untaxed fringe

benefits, and to engage in other forms of tax avoidance. Taxpayers at the top
of the income distribution faced marginal tax rates as high as 70% in 1980,
while in 1988, their marginal tax rates were capped at 28%.
The suggestion that recent tax reforms induced changes in reported taxable

income, even if they did not affect taxpayer behavior, lies at the center of
the recent debate on whether the tax reforms of the 1980s increased labor

supply (see Bosworth and Burtless (1992) and Lindsey (l987a, 1989)). Because

3

the Congressional Budget Office (CEO) dsta on income distribution, the data
underlying the Krugman (1992) calculation, rely on tsx returns for data on the
incomes of high—income households, changes in taxpayer reporting behavior
could directly affect estimates of income inequality.
This paper presents new evidence on the changing share of adjusted gross

income (Ad) reported by very high income taxpayers. We focus primarily on
the comparison of annual income distributions for the years 1951—1990, and
limit most of our analysis to the top one half of one percent of taxpayers.
We docwnenc the changing composition of income reported by these households,
and try to provide some evidence on the importance of tax—induced changes in

income reporting in contributing to this group's rising share of ACT. We do
not explore the variation in the relative incomes of households elsewhere in
the income distribution, a subject which has also attracted substantial

controversy (see Nasar (1992) and Roberts (1992)). Tax returns are not the
best source of information for studying the distribution of income below the

very top income tier, since they do not include information on transfer
payments and not all low—income households file tax returns.

This paper is divided into six sections. The first describes our methods
for using tax return data to estimate the share and composition of income
accruing to high income taxpayers, who we label lop ACT Recipients (TARs).
Section two describes the impact of the major tax reforms in 1981 and 1986 on

the incentives for high—income taxpayers to report report taxable income. The
third section presents time series information on the share of adjusted gross
income (ACT), as well as various ACT components such as wages and salaries,

dividends, interest, and capital gains, reported by these taxpayers. We find
that most of the increase in the share of income reported by taxpayers in the

top fifth of the income distribution is accounted for by an increase in the
share of reported income in the top one Quarter of one oercent of taxpayers.
Our results also suggest that the increase in reported income inequality
is not simply an artifact of capital gains realizations in the l980s, but
reflects changes in the distribution of most other income sources as well.
The share of income reported by top income taxpayers rose throughout the

l9SOs, but we find the sharpest increase in 1987 and 1988, the years following
a significant decline in marginal tax rates. We therefore conclude, in
contrast to Slernrod (1992) ,

that

changes in decisions about how much taxable

income to report have contributed to the observed increase in the reported

incomes of high—income households. Unfortunately, we cannot estimate the
share of the reported increase in income that is due solely to changes in
taxpayer reporting practices.
Section four presents data on the composition of reported income for

high—income households. Wages and salaries became substantially more
important, and capital income less important, between 1970 and the mid—l980s.
We find that this trend began roughly in 1969, when the top marginal tax rate

on earned income fell from 77% to 50%. The fifth section investigatea the
extent to which the changing income share of top—income taxpayers can be
attributed to changes in the composition of factor rewards in the aggregate
economy, rather than shifts within the distribution of each type of factor

income. We find that high stock market returns during the l980s would have
raised the income share of top—income taxpayers even if the ownership of stock
had remained fixed at its 1979 levels. The actual share of income received by
these households rose faster than the changing distribution of aggregate

factor rewards would have predicted. The changing mix of factor incomes is

particularly unsuccessful in explaining the rapid growth in the share of Ad

reported by high—income households in the years following the 1986 Tax Reform
Act. The final section concludes and suggests several avenues for further
work.

1. Estimating the Income of Very High Income Households
The Congressional Budget Office makes widely—cited estimates of the

changing shape of the U.S. income distribution (see CBO (l992a, b)). This
distribution is defined in terms of adjusted family income (AFI). AFI is
similar to adjusted gross income as defined by the federal income tax, but it
also includes cash transfer payments, such as welfare and Social Security, and
an imputation of taxes paid by firms, and excludes some business losses that
can be deducted when taxpayers compute adjusted gross income.
Table 1 shows the CBO's estimates of the share of AFI accruing to
households in the top fifrh of the income distribution during the period 1977—

1988. The estimates show a rising share of income accruing to this group, and
in particular show that the top one percent of households account for a very

large share of the total increase for the top quincile. In 1977, the
estimates suggest that the top 20% of all households received 45.6% of
adjusted family income, while in 1988, the analogous group received 51.4% of

the total. The share received by the top one percent of households, however,
rose from 8.3% (1977) to 13.4% (1988). This increase of 5.2% is ninety
percent of the 5.8% increase for the top twenty percent. The lower panel in
Table 1 shows the share of wages and salaries accruing to the top 20% and the

top 1% of households. The highest one percent accounts for two thirds of the

6

gain in the share of wages and salaries reported by all households in the top
fifth of the income distribution.

An income distribution can be defined over households, as in the
Congressional Budget Office estimates, or over taxpayers or individualsj

Each of these three options has advantages and drawbacks. Focusing on
households can be misleading because demographic changes can shift the
characteristics and number of households. Between 1960 and 1989, the average
number of individuals per U.S. household declined from 3.3 to 2.6. The shares
of single—person households, and households headed by a single adult with

children, have increased significantly in recent decades. Since these
households have lower incomes on average than other households, the share of
income accruing to a given fraction of households at the top of the income

distribution should increase as a result of this demographic change. While
this may contaminate comparisons of the top of the household income

distribution in widely separated years, it is unlikely to have a large effect
on comparisons of the income distribution over short time periods.
Defining the income distribution in terms of a given share of tax
returns, which would be a natural choice given our focus on tax data, can also

yield spurious results. The number of tax returns filed varies with changes
in the tax law. The 1986 Tax Reform Act was expected to remove almost six
million low—income households from the tax rolls (see Hausman and Poterba
(1987)). By shrinking the number of taxpayers, such a reform would lower the
number of tax returns in the top percentile of the taxpayer distribution.

11n 1989, there were 93 million households in the U.S., 66 million of
which were "family households." By comparison, 113 million tax returns were
filed in 1989.

Secause the taxpayers removed from the tax rolls typically have very low
incomes, this change would reduce the share of income reported by the top

percentile of taxpayers. This could bias comparisons between income
distribution statistics, even for adjacent years, when the tax system is in
flux.

The third alternative, defining the income distribution over individuals,

also raises difficult issues, such as how to treat spouses and children. Do
they receive a proportional share of household income? If so, then if a
single high—income taxpayer marries a lower income earner, she may drop out of

the high—income category. The birth of children to high—income households
could have the same effect.
Our approach to identifying the top of the income distribution begins

with the set of tax returns filed in 1989. We select the top one half of one
percent of tax returns; in 1989, there were 558,778 tax returns in this

group.2 We define this number of returns as N1989, and then compute an
analogous number of returns in other years by multiplying N1989 by the ratio

of the adult poouletion in each year to that in 1989. Our procedure in effect
indexes the number of high—income tax returns to the aggregate population,
rather than the aggregate number of tax returns filed or the total number of

households. We define the top Nt taxpayers in each year as "Top AOl

2Our reported income share for high—income households would not change if
a top income taxpayer married someone with no income, although it would
increase if a high—income taxpayer married another income recipient. It is
also possible that marriages or divorces between individuals with high but not
very high incomes could affect the income reported by the TAR group.

Recipients" (TARs) .

They represent roughly half as many households as the

030's top one percent of the income distribution.3

1.1 Estimating Income Shares Using the Treasury Tax Model
In each yeat since 1968, the U.S. Tteasury has released a data file
containing an anonymous sample of individual tax returns, the Treasury Tax
Model data base, which can be used to estimate the total income of high—income

taxpayers. This data file over—samples high income tax returns, and thetefore
provides reasonably accurate information on this group's income.
Table 2 shows the number of tax returns at different income levels in the
1989 Tax Model, and indicates the sampling weights associated with returns in

each group. There are nearly 12,000 returns with incomes of more than
$1,000,000 in the data base. The probability that s tax filer with taxable
income in this range would be included in the data file is approximately one

in five. There are a similar number of tax returns with taxable incomes
between $50,000 and $100,000, but each return filed in this income group has

less than a 1 in 1000 chance of being included on the data file. The Treasury
Tax Model data bases for each year since 1979 are part of the NBER TAXSIM
program, and we use these data files to tabulate the distribution of both AGI
and various AGI components for these years.4

3Although our data set on federal tax returns does not include
information on the state in which the tax filer resides, we can compare the
number of federal income tax returns above various threshold income levels
with state revenue statistics. They show some, but not extreme, concentration
of tax returns. In 1989, for example, New York residents filed 3.7% of all
federal income tax returns, but 12.9% of all returns with ACT in excess of $1
million.

4We compute the changing shares of Ad reported in each year, despite the
fact that the definition of ACT changes when, for example, the capital gmins
exclusion is eliminated. This is partly for comparison with the widely—cited
results from the 080. Our results also focus on several components of ACT
with constant definitions through time.

1.2 "Interpolating" Incomes for High—Income Taxpayers
For years prior to 1979, we rely on aggregate data published by the
Treasury Department in Statistics of Income: Individual Income Tax Returns

(SOl) to estimate the income of TARs.5 The SOl tables ahow the number of tax
returns, and reported AOl, in various taxable income intervals. The reported
AOl categories for high income taxpayers have remained fixed in nominal terms
for nearly three decades, with taxpayers divided into those with Ads of 100—
200K, 200—500K, 500—1000K, and more than one million dollars. Estimating the
amount of Act reported by a given share of taxpayers therefore requires
interpolating the IRS data.

To estimate the total income accruing to the top 0.5% of taxpayers, we
interpolate Aol within reported AOl categories below one million dollars.
Instead of simple linear interpolation, we estimate a Pareto distribution for
high—income tax returns, and use our estimated distribution to estimate the
total income accruing to top AOl recipients (TARs) .

The Pareto is a two—

parameter distribution which is widely used in modelling the distributions of
income and wages (see Johnson and Kotz (1970)).
We present the details of our interpolation procedure in an appendix, but

illustrate our method in Figure 0. This figure shows our estimated Pareto
distribution for 1990, e year when our estimate of the income threshold for
inclusion in the top 0.5% of the taxpayer distribution was $258,499 ('1*).

In

this case, we can determine from the reported IRS data that the AOl threshold

for this group lies between $200,000 and $500,000. We use the reported

5To ensure comparability over time, in any of our tables or figures that
show results for the 1950—1990 period, we also interpolate during the 1979—
1990 period when we could make more precise estimates using the Tax Model data
base.

10

information on the fraction of tax returns with AOl above $200,000, and on the
fraction with AOl above $500,000, to estimate the parameters of a Pareto

distribution. We then use this distribution to estimate Y*.
Table 3 describes the results of our interpolation procedure. The first
and second columns present our estimates of the cutoff income level for the

Top AOl Recipients. Figure 1 also plots this income cutoff, measured in
constant dollars. This income threshold increased only ten percent in real
terms between 1970 and 1985, but in the four years 1985—1989, it increased by

nearly 50%, or almost $85,000 ($1991). The late 1980s therefore appear to be
the time period when the reported income distribution changed the most amongst
high—income taxpayers.
The third and fourth columns in Table 3 show the number and share of tax

returns that are included in our high—income group. These columns show the
net effect of our indexing the number of TARs to the adult population, rather
than to the number of tax returns filed.6 In the years since 1986, the share
of returns in the TAR group varies very little. Between 1986 and 1987, it
declined by .02%. There is very little change in the share of tax returns in
the TAR group between 1975 and 1986, although there is some evidence that the
number of tax returns grew more slowly than population for the period 1955—

1975. Our TAR group includes a larger share of tax returns in 1960 (.58%)
than in 1970 (.55), 1980 (.54%), or 1990 (.50%). This should tend to increase
the share of reported income accruing to the TAR group in the early years of
our data period, and yield a downward bias in our estimate of the trend in the
TAR income share over time.

6lndexing to the number of returns filed would make the last column of
Table 3 equal to .005 in all years.

2. Tax Changes and Incentives for Reporting Taxable Income
Tax policy parameters such as marginal tax rates can affect the amount of
income reported on tax returns either by inducing real changes in individual

behavior, for example changes in the number of hours that individuals work, or

by inducing changes in the reportine of a given income stream. Because
taxpayers can use a variety of tax avoidance techniques to defer or reclassify
their income, the tax base is sensitive to decisions about how much income to

report. This section provides a brief overview of the changing tax avoidance
incentives facing high—income taxpayers.

2.1 Earned Income
The two most significant changes in the tax rates on earned income of
high—income taxpayers took place in 1969 and 1986. The Tax Reform Act of 1969
capped the marginal tax rate on earned income at 50%, at a time when the top
marginal tax rate on unearned income was 70% (77% including the Vietnam war

surtax). The top marginal tax rate on earned income remained at 50% through
1986, although rates just below those of top income taxpayers were reduced by

the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA). The Tax Reform Act of 1986
(TRA86) reduced the top marginal tax rate on earned as well as unearned income
from 50% to 28%, providing a second major reduction in the tax burden on this
income, and consequently lowering the incentives to (legally) avoid taxes.
Declining marginal tax rates reduced the incentives to engage in a

variety of tax—avoidance practices. One simple avoidance strategy involves
transforming earned income into fringe benefits, ranging from company cars and

conference "vacations," to health and life insurance policies. There is a
large literature, cited for example in Woodbury and Hsismermesh (1992),

12

suggesting thst the demsnd for fringe benefits is sensitive to the marginel

tax rate on esrned income. A related strategy involves deferring earned
income, and the associated taxes, to later years. Over long horizons, income
could be deferred with retirement plans or explicit deferred compensation

arrangements (see Wolfson and Scholes (l992)).
In addition to long—run deferral strategies, some taxpayers may have used
short—term income retiming straregies to move income from 1985 and 1986 to

1987 or 1988. Taxpayers with some discretion in when they bill clients for
their services, and those who receive large bonuses or otherwise lumpy earned
income, faced strong incentives in 1986 to find ways to avoid recognizing

income until lower tax rates had become effective in later years. Deferring
income by fourteen months, from December 1986 to January 1988, could raise a
taxpayer's after—tax income by 44% (from 50 cents on the dollar to 72 cents).

This provided powerful incentives to engage in a wide range of income—retiming
activities which are unfortunately difficult to measure from tax returns or
ocher public data sources.

A particularly significant dimension of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, from
the perspective of high—income taxpayers, was the changed incentives for using

Subchapter C corporations to avoid recognizing personal income. Before 1986,
a dollar reported as individual income faced a tax burden of 50 cents, while a
dollar earned by a subchapter C corporation faced a marginal tax rate of 46%,

with somewhat lower rates on the first $100,000 of income. Corporate income
could bear subsequent individual—level taxes if the income was distributed as

7In the first few years of a low—tax rate regime, such as 1987 and 1988,
it is even possible that individuals who had previously deferred income by
contributing to retirement plans would withdraw plan assets, also leading to
an increase in reported income.

13

wages or dividends, although there were strategies, for example bequeathing
stock in a closely—held business, that could reduce such taxes.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the top personal income tax rate to a

level below the corporate rate. A dollar of income reported directly on an
individual income tax return faced a tax burden of 28% after 1988, compared

with at least 34% if it was earned by a Subchapter C company. As Gordon and
Mackie—Mason (1990) explain, these tax changes reduced the incentive to use
corporations to shelter income, and could have led to an increase in reported

income for high income taxpeyers. Anecdotal evidence of the potential
importance of this effect is provided by Wolfson and Scholes (1992), who note
that there were 225,000 S—corporation elections in the last three weeks of
1986, compared with only 75,000 elections in the entirety of 1985.

2.2 Capital Income
The tax changes that were enacted in 1981 reduced the top tax rate on

unearned income other than capital gains from 70% to 50%. TRA86 further
reduced this top race to 28%. The tax rules affecting capital gains are mote
complex. Between 1969 and 1978, fifty percent of long—term capital gains
could be excluded from taxable income, implying a top marginal tax rate of 35%

(70%*.5). For some taxpayers, however, because the excluded portion of
capital gains was considered a tax preference item for the minimum tax, the

marginal rate on realized gains could exceed 40% (see Lindsey (l987b)). This
situation changed in by the Tax Reform Act of 1978, which excluded capital
gains from the set of minimum tax preference items, effective in 1979, and

raised the excluded share of long—term gains to 60%. This reduced the top
statutory tax rate on capital gains to 28%, This pre—announced tax change led

14

to significant delay in the realization of capital gains, as we shall see

below. The top marginal rate cuts in the 1981 tax reform, ERTA, futther
reduced the top marginal tax rate on capital gains from 28% to 20%.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 raised the top mstginal rate on capital gains
ftom 20% to 28%, since it eliminated the exclusion provisions for gains.
Because the 1986 changes were legislated to take effect in 1987, there was a
strong incentive for taxpayers with accrued but unrealized gains to realize

these gains in 1986. This "retiming" of gains is a striking feature of the
time series on gain realizations (see Auerbsch (1988)).
This brief summary of the tax rates facing high—income households
suggests that there have been important changes over time in the after—tax

income gains associated with legal tax avoidance strategies. We now consider
the detailed information on income reports by these households, to investigate
whether there is evidence that such changes in taxpayer behavior took place.

3. The Share of Income Received by Too ACT Recioients
This section reports our basic findings on the changing concentration of

reported income amongst high—income taxpayers. Figure 2 shows our estimate of
the share of adjusted gross income actruing to TARs in each year between 1951

and 1990.8 The figure shows that the ACT share of this group declined during
the l9SOs and l960s, was roughly stable during the 1970s, and increased during

the l980s. The share of ACT reported by roughly the top one half of one

8We have not made the various adjustments to ACT that the Congressional
Budget Office uses in computing "economic income" of households. For
households in our ACT class, the most important CEO modifications are
exclusion of some losses on real property, arguably the result of tax shelter
investments, and the inclusion of some corporate tax payments as a component
of taxpayer income.

15

percent of taxpayers rose from six percent in 1981 to over twelve percent in
1988. The sharpest increase in ACT concentration occured between 1985 and
1988, when the income shsre of this group rose from 8% to 12%. The TAR share
of ACT also fell more than a full percentage point in 1989 and 1990, which
could be consistent with an active role for short—term end one—time income
retiming strategies in the years immediately following enactment of TR.A86.

One possible explanation for the rising concentration of ACT amongst top
income reoipi.ents is that capital gains realizations rose during the l980s,

and that they are a highly concentrated form of income. Figure 3 shows the
share of adjusted gross income excluding taoitsl gains reported by the top ACI

recipients. The figure focuses on the period since 1979, and shows that while
the non—gain ACI share of this group rose by almost one percentage point
between 1979 and 1986, it rose by more than three percentage points between

1986 and 1988. This figure suggests thet capital gains are

the

explanation for the broad trend in the oonoentration of ACT. It also
demonstrates, however, that there was a rapid increase in reported non—capital
gain income among TARs in the years immediately following the Tax Reform Act

of 1986. This is consistent with the view that these taxpayers reported more
of their income in taxable form when marginal tax rates declined.
Although most of our analysis focuses on the top one half of one percent
of tax returns, we also examined reported ACT for several other subsets of the

high—income population. The first two columns of Table 4 report the ACT share
for the top one—tenth, and top one—quarter, of one percent of the distribution

of tax returns. The middle column reports data for the top one half of one
percent of taxpayers, the TAR group that we focus on elsewhere. The two
rightmost oolumns show the share of ACT reported by the top one and two

16

percent of taxpayers for rhe years 1979—1989. These estimates are based on
the Treasury Tax Model data bases.

Table 4 shows that even within the top two percent of the taxpayer
distribution, the gains in reported AGI during the 1980s were highly

concentrated. The share of AGI reported on the top two percent of tax returns
rose by 6.04% between 1979 and 1989, but more than half of this increase,
3.35%, was reported on the top one tenth of one percent of tax returns

(roughly one hundred thousand tax returns). More than two thirds of the
increase in AOl for the top two percent was reported by the top one quarter of

one percent of taxpayers. These findings are consistent with Krugman's (1992)
fractal" hypothesis about the shape of the income distribution.

Figure 4 makes the same point with a slightly different approach. While
Table 4 shows the share of AOl reported by overlapping groups: the top .1% of

taxpayers, the top .25%, and so on. Figure 4 shows the share of AGI reported

by five non—overlapping groups: the top .2%, the gfl .2%, etc. The top line
in Figure 4 is the share of ACT reported by the top one fifth of one percent

of taxpayers. It shows a sharp increase between 1986 and 1988, and declines
slightly in 1989. Figure 4 shows that there has been a relatively small
increase in the AOl shares for all groups below the top one fifth of one

percent of taxpayers.9 This casts doubt on the view that the factors
responsible for the increase in reported incomes among high income taxpayers,
especially in the 1986—1988 period, are the same factors that were responsible

9Our tabulations focus on the distribution of income for taxpayers in

each year, not the distribution of the aa taxpayers over time. Thus the
taxpayers in the top Aol category in one year may be different from those in
this category in the next year. Slemrod (1991) provides some evidence on the
persistence of income for high—income taxpayers.

for the widening of the wage diatribution over a longer time period. Figure 4
also underscores the importance of the post—1986 period in contributing to the
changes in reported income concentration during the 1980s.
The lower panel of Table 4 reports similar calculations for AOl excluding

capital gains. These data show the same pattern as the gain—inclusive AOl
statistics, with more than half of the increase in non—gain AOl for the top 2%

of taxpayers accruing to the top 0.1% of taxpayers. Comparing the upper and
lower panels of Table 4 provides interesting evidence, however, on the

relative timing of the concentration of gain and non—gain income. While the
share of total Aol, including gains, reported by the top .1% of taxpayers rose
from 2.6% to 3.8% between 1979 and 1985, the share of non—gain income

increased less — from 2.2% to 2.95%. In the post—1986 period, however, the
non—gain income share for this group grew faster than its share of total Aol.
This auggests that gain realizations were a more important factor in the
concentration of AOl in the early than in the late l980s.

We can also perform a similar analysis for components of income. Figure
5 presents data on the share of wages and salaries accruing to taxpayers in

each fifth of the top one percent of the taxpayer diarributionj0 The figure
shows some growth in the share of wages for each of the high—income groups

between 1979 and 1989. The figure displays a dramatic increase, however, in
the share of wages for the top 0.2% of taxpayera. Three quarters of this
increase occurs between 1986 and 1988, and the sharp break in the trend growth
rate in 1986 is strongly suggestive of a link between the Tax Reform Act of
1986 and this pattern of reported income.

10We continue to sort taxpayers by total Aol in preparing this figure.

18

The data in Figure 5 concentrate on the last decade, but we can also use

the aggregate IRS data to estimate the share of wages and salaries reported by
lop AOl Recipients for a longer time period. Figure 6 presents this data.
While the rapid increase in wage concentration after 1986 is unusual by
historical standards, the trend toward rising concentration of wages and
salaries begins in the early 1970s. The wage share of the TARs rose by nearly
1.5 percentage points between 1970 and 1980, by another 0.5 percent between
1980 and 1985, and then by more than two percentage points in the two years

after the lax Reform Act of 1986. The beginning of the trend toward rising
wage and salary concentration is roughly coincident with the lax Reform Act of
1969, which reduced the top tax rate on earned income from 77% to 50%. We
suspect that the large increase in reported TAR wages and salaries in the
years after 1986 reflects, at least in part, a reporting response to lower
marginal tax rates of this period.
The findings in this section suggest that whatever forces were behind the
rising concentration of reported income in the high—income ranks during the

l980s, they were strongly concentrated amongst a small group of taxpayers, and
strongly concentrated in the years after 1986. Without much more precise
information on the financial and tax—planning activities of high—income
taxpayers, it is impossible to determine how much of the increase in reported
income was due to changes in tax avoidance behavior, how much was due to
changes in real behavior such as labor supply, and how much was due to
changing returns to the factors, labor and capital that high—income taxpayers

own. Evaluating these three alternatives is a central goal for future work.

19

4. The Income Composition of High—Income Taxpayers
The previous secrion considered the share of total Ad, AGI excluding
capital gains, and wages and salaries, accruing to high—income taxpayers.

This section explores a different issue: what fraction of the income reported
by top—income taxpayers is from various income sources, and how has this
income mix changed over time?
Figure 7 shows wage and salary income as a share of adjusted gross income

for TARs over the 1951—1990 period. The figure shows that the wage and salary
share of AOl for high—income taxpayers that came from wages and salaries rose
during the 1970s, from one third to one half of the AOl for this group.11
During the 1980s, however, while the concentration of wage income increased,

the wage share of income for the TARs actually declined. Figure 7 also shows
a very sharp decline, by over ten percentage points, between 1985 and 1987.

Figure 8 reports an analgous calculation for dividend income. The
stylized view that high—income taxpayers derive most of their income from
dividend payments has become increasingly inappropriate during the last three

decades. While the TARs drew roughly one quarter of their income from
dividends in the early l9SOs, this income source declined to only aix percent
of the total in 1989.12

11The House Ways and Means Committee (1991) reports data from the
Congressional Budget Office on the top 1% of the income distribution for
households. The increase in the share of wage income, from 34.2% in 1977 to
38.4% in 1988, is less pronounced in part because of the larger set of
households included in the 080's "top 1%" group.
120ne factor that may partly explsin this trend, especially in the 1980s,
is the rise of money market mutual fund shares which may generate dividends
for lower income households.

20

While dividends have become a less important income source for TARs, the

share of dividends received by high—income taxpayers has also fallen. Figure
9 shows that in the late 1980s, the top 0.5% of taxpayers reported roughly one
quarter of the dividends on all tax returns, compared with nearly half of all

dividends in the late 1950a. A similar plot for interest income, in Figure
10, shows a rather different pattern. The share of interest received by TARs
declined between 1951 and the early l960s, was stable at about 10% until 1986,

and then rose by almost five percentage points between 1986 and 1988. Since
clientele models of asset ownership suggest that the relative tax rates of
different investors play a key role in determining portfolio composition, the
post—1986 changes may reflect the changing relative marginal tax rates of TARs

and investors elsewhere in the income distribution. In particular, they may
be driven by the declining tax penalty associated with holding interest—

bearing securities at top income brackets. The lower tax penalty was the
result of both declining marginal tax rates, and a decline in the rate of
inflation, which reduced the effective tax burden on interest income.

The next source of income we consider is capital gains. Figure 11 shows
that the share of all capital gains reported by top—income taxpayers was
stable at approximately 45% throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but fell to only

20% in the late l970a. This was a period when, as we noted above, the
marginal tax rate on capital gains received by high—incoae taxpayers could

exceed forty percent. The sharp decline capital gains as a share of AOl in
1978 reflects the impact of an announced reduction in capital gains tax rates
that was enacted in 1978 but scheduled to take effect in 1979, leading to

deferral of gain realization. The ahare of capital gains reported by theae
taxpayers rose during the l980s, to just over 50% in the second half of the

21

decade. The share of capital gains reported by the top AGI recipients evolves
smoothly in the years surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
The final category of income we consider is income from Subchapter S

corporations. Figure 12 shows that the share of profita from these companies
reported by TARs increased during both the 1981—1983 and the 1986—1988

periods. We do not show the changing level of Subchapter S income on all tax
returns. Gordon and MacIde—Mason (1990) report thia aggregate series for all
taxpayers, and find a sharp increase in Subchapter S income in the years after
the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

5.

The Changing Mix of Factor Incomes and Income Inequality
Some types of income, such as dividends and capital gains, are

distributed less equally than othera, such as wages. Thedistribution of
reported ACT may become more unequal if the inequality of some AGI components
increases, or the relative importance of some particularly unequally

distributed components increases.13 Some types of income, such as dividends
and capital gains, are distributed less equally than others. In this section
we inveatigata whether the changing mix of income components during the l980s
can explain much of the increasing concentration of AOl that we observed in
previous sections.
We investigate this question by constructing a counterfactual income

distribution for each year of the 1980a. We maintained the 1979 distribution
of each type of income across tax returns, but allowed the level of each

13Karoly (1992) shows how to formally decompose one measure of aggregate
income inequality, the Cmi coefficient, into a weighted sum of Cmi
coefficients for the various income components.

22

income type to vary from year to year as the aggregate Statistics of Income

data suggestJ4
Table S presents the results of our calculations, which suggest that the
shifting mix of fsctor incomes did contribute to an increase in the

concentration of AOl during the 1980s.15 If the distribution of each income
type had remained at its 1979 level, but the mix of income types
as it did, the share of AOl accruing to TARs

had

changed

would have increased from 6.05%

in 1979 to 7.69% by 1988. This is substantially less than the actual
increase, to 12.02%. Our predicted income share tracks the actual income
shsre much better for the years before 1986 than in the 1987—1988 period. We
also present results for a similar exercise with AOl excluding capital gains,

which yields similar results. These estimates suggest that rising share of
income reported by TARs during the last decade can not simply be attributed to
a shifting mix of income components, but rather reflects some shift in the
underlying distribution of these components as well.

6.

Conclusions and Further Research
Our analysis of tax return data for the period 1951—1990 suggests that

the rising share of adjusted gross income (Aol) reported income on high income

tax returns is largely due to an increase in the share of Aol reported by only
a few tenths of one percent of the taxpaying population. The changes through

141n cases where an income source can be negative, for example with
Schedule C or E income, we varied and distributed positive and negative income
separately.

tax returns in each year than our other TAR calculations.

it

23

time in the reported incomes of taxpayers near the top of the income
distribution, even those in the "lower half" of the top one percent of all
taxpayers, are substantially different than the changes for the highest—income

taxpayers, especially in the years following the 1986 Tax Reform Act. This
suggests that the rapid growth in reported incomes at very high income levels
may not be part of a general trend toward a widening distribution of income,
but may reflect other factors including a tax—induced change in the share of
economic income that is reported as taxable income by high—income taxpayers.

Our results are not inconsistent with the widely—documented pattern of
widening wage inequality in recent years. Studies based on labor market
surveys such as the Current Population Survey, however, typically have little

or no information on the incomes of top—income households. In the CPS, for
example, income items are "top—coded" at $100,000. The widening inequality
observed throughout the wage distribution creates a strong presumption that
wages and salaries at the very top of the income distribution have increased

relative ro those elsewhere. Yet those studies do not suggest that the period
after 1986 ware marked by sharp acceleration in the dispersion of earning

power. The finding that the growth in AOl for very high income taxpayers was
most rapid in these years suggests that the underlying determinants of
reported AOl for this group may be significantly different from the
determinants of relative incomes at lower incomes.

There are many directions in which our current work can be extended. Our
analysis focuses on pretax incomes, rather than the after—tax incomes that

provide individuals with command over resources. Computing effective tax
rates on different taxpayers requires various imputations of taxes on firms

24

and workers, as in Kasten, Sammartino, and Toder (1992) or CEO (1992b), and we
have not attempted this complex task.

The most pressing research priority involves searching for sources of
data other than tax returns that provide information on the incomes of high—

income individuals. There are some sources of information on compensation for
high—paid individuals, such as the data set on CEO pay compiled by Joskow,
Rose, and Shepard (1992), or surveys of earnings by lawyers and doctors that

are carried out by professional organizations. These data sets may permit
analysis of how tax reforms have affected the mix of compensation, while also

providing further evidence on the trends in earnings, if not total income, for
high—income taxpayers.

Technical Aooendix: Interoolation Uaina the Pareto Distribution
The Pareto distribution specifies that the probability that s randomly
chosen taxpayer's income, y, is greater than x is:

Pr(y >

(1)

x) —

(k/x)°.

The two parameters are k, the minimum income that the Pareto distribution

applies to (k >

0).

and a, the exponent that determines the shape of the

distribution.

Our objective is to estimate the total income of taxpayers in roughly the

top 0.5% of the taxpayer distribution. Reported data on the number of returns
and total AOl for taxpayers in different AOl categories provides us with exact

income totals for subsets of the top 0.5% of the distribution. We can
identify the income range where the breakpoint for the top 0.5% of the

taxpayer distribution will fall. To "fill in" the top 0.5%, we eatimate the
parameters of the Pareto distribution uaing information on the reported income

cutoffs that bracket the actual breakpoint in each yearJ6 Denote theae
cutoff incomea as y1 and y2, and the associated probabilities that a

taxpayer's income will fall

these cutoffs as F1 and F2, respectively.

distribution yielda

Solving theae two equations yields an estimate of a:

interpolation from the published 501 data.

29

Given this value for a, our estimate of k is

k —

(4)

y1(l_F1)(l/m).

A discussion of some of the issues involved in estimating parameters of the
Pareto distribution can be found in Johnson and Kotz (1970) and Quandt (1966).

Table A—i shows our parameter estimates for each year between 1951 and
1990. The parameter k is measured in current dollars, and corresponds to the
income level below which the Pareto distribution would not apply. The m
parameter, which determines the rate at which the density of households
declines as one moves to higher incomes, rises between the early 1950s and
1970, and then declines for the following two decades.
We can estimate that income threshold, y*, that only lOOs% of all

taxpayers have incomes above from our estimated Pareto distributions. The
value y* satisfies the equation a —

(k/y*)°,

—

5-1/a

Our estimate of

the total income accruing to taxpayers with incomes above y* is therefore
— N

(5)

N

where N denotes the total number of tax returns. When we need to interpolate
particular types of income rather than AGI, for example wages and salaries, we
assume that the amount of income in each category (wi) is related to AOl (y)

according to a power function, wi — cy6.

Total wage income received by

taxpayers with incomes above y1, which we shall denote w1, is given by the
integral over taxpayers' income of the income component at each AOl level,
times the density of taxpayers at that income:

expression for w2 yields two equations in two unknowns. Solving for

c —

Because the actual amount of wage income above Y2 is a published aggregate,
only the amount of wages between y* and Y2 needs to be approximated.
We performed several validation exercises on our estimated Pareto
distributions and found that they fit the actual income data reasonably well

in the neighborhood of y*. For years since 1979, we can compare our estimate
of the share of income accruing to top—income taxpayers with the more accurate
estimates from the public use version of the Treasury Individual Tax Model.

Table A—2 presents the results of this validation exercise. The largest error
in our estimate of the share of total income accruing to high income taxpayers

is .44%, in 1982, and the next largest error is .36% in 1986. That year's
exceptional level of capital gain realizations (see Auerbach (1988)) may be a
contributory factor to our error, particularly if realized capital gains are

not distributed according to a Pareto distribution. These results support our
use of the interpolated values for the income distribution, especially for
years in the late l980s when the difference between the Tax Model and imputed
values are small.
