Trade Linkages and Output-Multiplier Effects:
A Structural VAR Approach with a Focus on Asia

ABSTRACT
This paper develops a structural VAR model to measure how a shock to one country can affect
the GDP of other countries. It uses trade linkages to estimate the multiplier effects of a shock as it is
transmitted through other countries’ output fluctuations. The paper introduces a new specification strategy
that significantly reduces the number of unknowns and allows cross-country relationships to vary over
time. Then it uses this model to examine the impact of shocks to 11 Asian countries, the U.S. and the rest
of the OECD. The model produces reasonably good short-term forecasts. Impulse-response matrices
suggest that these multiplier effects are large and significant and can transmit shocks in very different
patterns than predicted from a bilateral-trade matrix. For example, due to these output-multiplier effects,
a shock to one country can have a large impact on countries that are relatively minor bilateral trading
partners.

1. INTRODUCTION
Why did the July 1997 devaluation of the Thai baht spur major currency realignments in
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore within a few weeks? Why did the December
1997 devaluation of the Korean won affect currencies and stock markets around the world−even
in many countries with few direct trade or investment links to Korea? In the past few years, an
extensive literature has attempted to answer these sorts of questions.1 This research has spawned
the widespread use of terms and phrases such as contagion, interdependence, spillovers, and the
Asian Flu. Despite the attention paid to these topics, there continues to be little agreement on
why a crisis in a relatively small economy can have such widespread global effects, or even how
to define terms such as contagion and spillovers.
This paper avoids the debate on definitions and instead focuses on measuring two
specific linkages that could transmit a crisis or shock from one country to another. The first
linkage is bilateral-trade flows. How important are export shares in determining a country's
vulnerability to a crisis that originates in a trading partner? Direct trade linkages are fairly
straightforward to document and have been examined in other papers. Most of these papers argue
that bilateral-trade flows are important determinants of a country's vulnerability to a crisis, but
that direct trade flows can only explain a small portion of the global effects of most recent
crises.2 This paper's estimates support this conclusion.
The main contribution of this paper is the modelling and estimation of a second linkage:
how a shock to one country can also have multiplier effects through its impact on output and
growth in other economies. It is extremely difficult to measure the magnitude of these indirect
multiplier effects, since measurement involves estimating a matrix connecting the output of all

countries in the world. This paper's estimates suggest that these indirect multiplier effects can be
important and can transmit crises through very different patterns than predicted by direct,
bilateral-trade flows. A series of impulse response functions shows that due to these indirect
multiplier effects, a shock to one country can have a large impact on other countries that are
relatively minor trading partners.
In order to estimate these output-multiplier linkages, a substantial portion of this paper
develops a structural VAR based on realistic identification assumptions. This model avoids
adopting an arbitrary recursive system as is frequently done in the VAR literature. More
specifically, the paper uses bilateral-trade flows to estimate a model linking output growth across
countries. Several previous papers have used VARs to link a variety of macroeconomic variables
across nations, but most of these models are problematic due to: profligate parameterisation,
arbitrary identification restrictions, and poor forecasting performance. Another key contribution
of this model is that cross-country relationships are allowed to vary over time. This is critical
when estimating relationships over long periods of time or after a crisis. This methodology not
only provides relatively good forecasts, but also may be useful in a wide variety of other
applications with a shortage of realistic, theory-based identification restrictions.
Although the structural VAR developed in this paper has a number of advantages, it is
also important to note its limitations. The paper uses trade flows between countries to proxy for a
wide variety of cross-country linkages: flows of goods and services, flows of foreign direct
investment, flows of bank lending, flows of mutual fund investment, flows of migrants and
workers, trade competition in third markets, etc. The paper does not try to measure and isolate
the impact of each of these cross-country linkages. It focuses on trade flows because these
statistics are more widely available and consistently measured across countries, as well as highly
correlated with other cross-country linkages. Although a greater level of disaggregation in crosscountry linkages would be useful, it is extremely difficult to obtain the requisite data at a high

3

enough frequency and to formulate realistic identification assumptions to estimate the resulting
model.3 Moreover, the structural VAR developed in this paper is explicitly designed to adjust for
time-varying omitted variables that are not incorporated in bilateral-trade flows.
After developing this structural VAR model, the paper uses this framework to estimate
trade linkages and output-multiplier effects between most of Asia and its major trading partners.
More specifically, it estimates direct and indirect linkages between the ASEAN-4 (Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand), the NIE-4 (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and
Taiwan), China, Japan, the U.S., and the rest of the OECD (called ROECD). Estimates of
indirect linkages between countries (as measured by the multiplier effects from changes in output
growth in other countries) often yield very different predictions about countries’ vulnerability to
crises than predicted by focusing only on bilateral-trade linkages. A series of impulse response
functions show that even if bilateral-trade linkages between two countries are weak, a shock to
one of the countries can have a significant effect on the other through the indirect impact on
other countries’ output.
The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 develops the structural VAR model and
discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. Section 3 compiles the necessary
data and discusses shortcomings with these statistics. Section 4 estimates the model using several
different procedures and Section 5 examines the model's forecasting ability. Section 6 presents
the central empirical results: a series of impulse response functions documenting the importance
of direct trade linkages and indirect multiplier effects in predicting the global impact of a shock
to a specific country. The final section of the paper concludes.

Project LINK (Ball, 1973) and the MSG2 model (developed in McKibbin and Sachs, 1991) aggregate
individual country models in an attempt to more accurately estimate these various global linkages. The
former was unsuccessful, with low predictive power and high standard errors, primarily because of
inconsistent data and models across countries. Since the latter is a computable general-equilibrium model
(CGE), it is not suitable for forecasting.

2. METHODOLOGY
This section develops the structural VAR model that is used to calculate the estimates in the
remainder of the paper. In order to capture both direct trade linkages as well as indirect multiplier
effects through output fluctuations in other nations, we develop a model simultaneously equating
output supply and demand across all countries in the world. We begin by focusing on the
determinants of total output (Yi) for an individual country i. The later part of this section extends
the framework to a system of equations linking all n countries in the world (with i=1,2,...,n).
Since we initially focus on only one country, we drop the subscript i to simplify notation.
A country's output can be written as:
Y=X+A

(1)

where X and A are the export and non-export components of output, respectively. The country's
total exports are the sum of exports to each of the other (n-1) countries and (1) can be expressed
as:
n

Y =∑Xj + A

(2)

j =1

where i ≠ j . This inequality condition continues to apply to all of the equations below.
Writing equation (2) in terms of growth rates instead of levels yields:


dY 1  n
=  ∑ dX j + dA
Y Y  j =1


(3)

Next, we specify exports from country i to country j as a reduced-form function of output in
country j:4
Xj = Xj(Yj).

(4)

Differentiating (4) yields:

∂X j

Next, insert (5) into (3):

which can be rearranged as

dY X n  X j dY j  dA
=

∑ ηj
Y
Y j =1
X Y j  Y

(7)

where η j = (∂X j / ∂Y j )(Y j / X j ) is the income elasticity of exports with respect to country j's
income.
Next, to simplify this equation we make an assumption underlying most aggregate
export-demand equations, that the income elasticities are equal across countries. As a result, ηj =

η and after adding country and time subscripts and using lower-case letters to indicate growth
rates, equation (7) can be written as:

yit = α i yitf + uit ,

where:

(8)

α = ηX / Y
y f = ∑(X j / X )y j

and uit captures any omitted variables not included in trade linkages. A useful characteristic of
equation (8) is that the right-hand side variable is an export-share weighted average of output
growth rates. Equally important is the characteristic that each export share is allowed to vary

4

The model can be extended in a straightforward manner to include a vector of other variables in the export
function. Abeysinghe (2001a, 2001b) provides this extension. We do not include these additional variables
in this version of the model since they are not included in the estimation in Section 4.

6

over time.5 A final point is that αi = ηX/Y is assumed to be time invariant. This assumption is
examined in detail in Section 4 (and is shown to be realistic).
Equation (8) is central to the estimation results reported below and highlights the
differences between this paper and previous work, as well as the key assumptions implicit in this
framework. If output growth in every country j is exogenous to output growth in country i (with
i≠j) then equation (8) would capture the direct impact of a shock in country j on country i. In
other words, if there was a negative shock to Japanese growth, equation (8) would measure how
direct trade linkages transmit this shock to a country such as Thailand by reducing exports from
Thailand to Japan. This is the measure used in most other papers examining the importance of
bilateral-trade linkages in the international transmission of shocks, but it ignores any indirect
effects of the initial shock on the output of other countries.
The goal of this model and paper, however, is to also estimate the indirect multiplier
effect of the shock through output growth in other countries. To do so, it assumes that output
growth in every country j is not exogenous to output growth in every other country i. Instead
equation (8) considers not only how slower growth in Japan directly affects exports (and
therefore growth) in Thailand, but also how slower growth in Japan reduces exports from Korea
and Indonesia, which in turn reduces growth in these countries and their demand for exports from
Thailand.
Next, as defined above in equation (8), uit captures any omitted variables not included in
trade linkages. These omitted variables are likely to be correlated over time as well as across
equations. Instead of trying to model these linkages explicitly, we assume that the vector ut =
(u1t, u2t, ...unt)’ follows a vector ARMA process, D(L)ut = E(L)et, where D(L) and E(L) are vector
polynomials in the lag operator L of orders p* and q*, respectively, and et is a vector white noise
5

Export shares could vary over time due to a number of factors such as: changes in tariffs or other trade
restrictions; changes in transportation costs; exchange-rate movements; or even unusual weather patterns

process with a zero mean and a diagonal covariance matrix. Using this error structure and
rewriting (8) in vector format yields:

y t = Ay tf + u t
= Ay tf + D( L) −1 E ( L)et
(9a)

D( L) *
E ( L)et , or
= Ay t +
| D( L) |
f

| D( L) | y t = | D( L) | Ay tf + vt

(9b)

where A=diag(α1, α2,...,αn) , |D(L)| and D(L)* are the determinant and adjoint matrices of D(L),
respectively, and vt = D(L)*E(L)et is an (n×1) vector. Note that every equation of (9b) has the
same AR polynomial given by |D(L)|, while each vit follows a separate MA process.6
Next, instead of attempting to model vit as an MA process, we assume that the serial
correlation of vit can be captured by a sufficiently rich AR structure. This has the additional
benefit of relaxing the constraint that each equation of (9b) must follow the same AR
polynomial. Equation (8) can therefore be expressed as an autoregressive distributed lag model
with white noise errors:

yit = λi + ∑φ ji yit − j + ∑ β ji yitf − j + ε it
where y itf =

∑w

y jt , i ≠ j and wij is the export share from the ith country to country j. The

j =1

export shares must sum to unity.
The entire system of equations is formed by estimating equation (10) for each of the n
countries in the world. Although these n equations appear to take the form of seemingly
unrelated regressions (SUR), they can also be expressed as a structural VAR. This structural

which affect commodity production. We assume that any changes in export shares are independent of the
elasticities of foreign demand.

These results follow from Zellner and Palm (1974).

The general VAR(p) form of (12) is:

(Β 0 ∗ Wt ) y t = λ + (Β 1 ∗ Wt −1 ) y t −1 + ... + (Β p ∗ Wt − p ) y t − p + ε t

(13)

where yt, εt, and λ are (n×1) vectors, Bj, (j=0,1,...,p) and W are (n×n) matrices, and ( B j * Wt − j )
are the effective parameter matrices.
Equation (13) constitutes the structural VAR model that forms the basis of the estimates
in the remainder of the paper. This model differs from the Sims-Bernanke type of structural VAR
in four ways.7 First, since W is known the model in (13) is over-identified, whereas SimsBernanke models are exactly identified. Second, the model in (13) is extremely parsimonious,
whereas Sims-Bernanke models are highly over-parameterised. Third, in (13) Var(εt) = Ω may

9

not necessarily be diagonal (and it is possible to test for its diagonality), whereas Sims-Bernanke
models assume the diagonality of Ω a priori. Fourth and finally, Wt is allowed to change over
time in (13), which introduces a changing parameter structure into the model. This structure is
critical to stabilize estimates during major shocks such as the Asian crisis and to generate preand post-crisis impulse responses.
Each of these four characteristics differentiating the model in (13) from the standard
Sims-Bernanke framework are important additions to the literature on structural VARs. The
methodology developed in this section may be useful in a wide variety of other applications with
a shortage of realistic, theory-based identification restrictions.

3. DATA
Although the model derived in Section 2 only includes two sets of variables (output growth for
each country and export shares linking each pair of countries), compiling consistent time series
for a sample of countries including the major Asian economies was not trivial. This section
summarizes the key characteristics of this data set, and the appendix describes sources and the
compilation process in detail.
We focus on 11 countries and 1 group: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand,
Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan, the U.S. and the rest of the OECD.
The first 4 countries are also referred to as the ASEAN-4 and the second 4 countries as the NIE4. The rest of the OECD is abbreviated as ROECD and includes all members of the OECD
except Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. Statistics for the ROECD are calculated as the
weighted-average effect of all countries in the group, so that the ROECD can be interpreted as

one large “country”.8 Our estimates focus on the period from the first quarter of 1978 through the
second quarter of 1998.9
We use quarterly data on real GDP to measure output and the logarithm of first
differences to calculate growth rates. We utilize data on merchandise exports between countries
to measure bilateral-trade flows.10 Next, we calculate the export-share matrix (W) as a 12-quarter
moving average of export shares. This strategy has two benefits. First, it allows for the exportshare matrix to vary smoothly over time. Although a constant W matrix would facilitate
estimation and forecasting, this is not realistic since trade patterns change significantly over the
long time period under consideration. Second, by using 12-quarter moving averages (and
assuming that parameter estimates are fairly stable over time), it is still possible to use this model
to forecast future changes in output for up to 8 quarters.
The final data set consists of 12 series of real GDP growth rates and 132 series of export
shares, each compiled on a quarterly basis from 1978 through 1998. Figure 1 graphs a selection
of the series on export shares and reveals a number of interesting patterns. First, the major export
markets for most Asian countries are the U.S. and the ROECD, followed by Japan. The one
exception is Indonesia, for which Japan is the largest export market. Second, the share of Hong
Kong's exports going to China has grown rapidly, although this statistic may include a large
number of re-exports. Third, a larger share of exports from Singapore goes to the ASEAN-4 than
from Taiwan. This could partially explain why the Asian crisis had a greater impact on Singapore
than on Taiwan. Fourth, exports between the ROECD and the U.S. are so large that exports from

Weights are equal to each country’s GDP in the current period. More specifically,

y ROECD ,t = ∑ wkt y kt where: k is an index for each country in the ROECD; wkt is country k’s PPP-adjusted
k

GDP as a share of total ROECD GDP in period t; and ykt is country k’s growth rate in period t.

We begin in the first quarter of 1978 because this is the first year with reliable GDP data for China. We
utilize export data starting in the first quarter of 1975 to calculate the necessary moving averages.

Ideally, we would also like to include service exports between countries. Unfortunately, this data is not
consistently available for our sample of countries and years.

these two countries to other nations are relatively negligible. Finally, China continues to be the
smallest export market for all countries in the sample except Hong Kong.

4. ESTIMATION
This section uses the data described above to estimate the model in (13). We set p=4 in order to
account for a stationary seasonal effect.11 When p=4 there are 708 VAR coefficients in (13), but
only 108 coefficients need to be estimated (12 in B0 and 24 in Bj for j=1,...,4). In addition, the
variance-covariance matrix ( Ω ) includes 98 unknowns. We utilize four lags of each yit
(i=1,2,..,12) as instruments. In other words, we use lagged values of the growth rates for all the
countries (and regions) in the sample as instruments. It is worth emphasizing that this approach is
only possible due to the assumption in the structural model that the growth rates in all countries
except i are included as a single trade-weighted aggregate variable and not as separate
explanatory variables.12
We use ordinary-least squares (OLS), two-stage least squares (2SLS), and three-stage
least squares (3SLS) to estimate the model and find similar results under each estimation
procedure.13 The 2SLS standard errors were roughly the same as (or slightly larger than) the OLS
standard errors. The 3SLS standard errors were 1 to 15 percent smaller than the 2SLS standard

11

Despite the fact that the data is seasonally adjusted, tests of the residuals suggest that all of the seasonal
variation has not been removed. Allowing p=4 removes this seasonal effect.

12

Regressing each

y tf on the above set of instruments yields R2’s around 0.8 for all countries (and regions)

except for the U.S. for which the R2 is 0.65. These R2’s are reasonably large for growth rate regressions,
suggesting that the instruments are of acceptable quality.
13
We are unable to implement a FIML procedure due to the interaction between yt and Wt. We estimate the
model with and without an intercept. Our discussion focuses on results without the intercept because when
we include a non-zero intercept, the intercept is never significant and coefficient standard errors increase
with virtually no change in the error variances.

12

errors and slightly larger than the OLS standard errors for 13 estimates. Although these
asymptotic standard errors suggest that 3SLS may be the optimal estimation technique, we adopt
2SLS in our base analysis for two reasons. First, the root mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of the
2SLS-based forecasts were smaller than those of the 3SLS-based forecasts. Second, the impulse
responses based on the 3SLS estimates were substantially larger than those based on the 2SLS
estimates. As discussed below, the difference appears to result from the accumulation of
estimation errors under the 3SLS.
A closer examination of the 2SLS residual-correlation matrix (reported in Table 1)
indicates why these estimates are better than 3SLS for forecasting and estimating impulse
responses. To test for non-zero correlations, we compute the Breusch-Pagan Lagrange-multiplier
test statistic λ = T ∑ rij2 recursively by arranging the correlations (rij) in ascending order and
comparing them to the Chi-square critical values.14 Although the test rejects the diagonality of

Ω , the recursive test indicates that only five correlations (bold in Table 1) are significantly
different from zero. As a result, the unrestricted Ω̂ causes the inferior performance of the 3SLS
estimates.
=============
Table 1
=============
The negative and statistically significant correlations in Table 1 are counter-intuitive.
One possibility is that they are statistical artifacts arising from poor data quality. As discussed in
Section 3, data compilation was a difficult task. The other possibility is that the negative
correlations may be capturing the effect of one or more omitted variables, such as cross-country
linkages other than direct trade flows. These omitted variables are extremely difficult (if not

impossible) to measure, especially at the high frequency that forms the basis of these estimates.
For example, the large negative correlation between the U.S. and ROECD (-0.45) could be
explained by the fact that exports from these two regions compete in third markets (such as
Asia). An unexpected appreciation of the dollar would improve the competitiveness (and
therefore volumes) of exports from the ROECD and reduce the competitiveness (and therefore
volumes) of exports from the U.S., therefore driving the negative correlation between the two
countries. There are a wide variety of potential omitted variables, such as competition in third
markets, which may not be fully captured in the estimates in Table 1.
As a final extension to the analysis in Table 1, we examine the recursive estimates of the
coefficients on the αi in (8) to see whether they converge to constant values. These coefficients
are calculated by arranging the ith equation of (13) in the format of (10) and then setting
4

j =0

j =1

α i = ∑ β ji /(1 − ∑ φ ji ) . The 2SLS recursive parameter estimates are reported in Table 2 and show

that the αi’s remain reasonably constant as the estimation period is extended.15 This stability is
particularly noteworthy during the Asian crisis and results from the changing trade patterns
captured by the Wt matrix.

5. FORECASTING PERFORMANCE
This section examines the (out-of-sample) forecasting performance of the model estimated in
Section 4. It evaluates the impact of using a constant export-share weighting matrix (W) and

The main exception is the Philippines, which appears to have a discernible trend. The fitted equation for
the Philippines had the poorest fit due to the presence of a strong seasonal effect that cannot be fully
removed by an adjustment such as the X11.

gauges the magnitude of the forecasting error as the forecasting horizon increases. For a given W
matrix and p=4, the forecasting model based on (13) can be written as:

y t = A1 y t −1 + A2 y t − 2 + A3 y t −3 + A4 y t − 4 + u t

(14)

where Ai = ( B0 * W ) − ( Bi * W ) , i=1,..4 and u t = ( B0 * W ) − ε t .

For a given W at time t we generate 1-step to 4-step-ahead forecasts from the first quarter
of 1994 through the second quarter of 1997 by increasing the time distance between Wt and the
forecast point. For example, we use W in the first quarter of 1994 to generate 1-step-ahead
forecasts through the second quarter of 1997. Then we arrange the associated forecast errors for
each country in a matrix such that the principle diagonal represents a zero distance between Wt
and the forecast point, the next upper diagonal corresponds to a distance of one quarter, etc. The
diagonal entries below the principle diagonal can be ignored because they correspond to using
future export shares to forecast present values. With four-step forecasts, this exercise provides 48
forecast error matrices (4 steps × 12 countries)16.
Next we tabulate the mean errors and RMSEs of the forecasted GDP growth rates
corresponding to nine W matrices, (Wt-i, i=0,1,…,8). Mean errors and RMSEs are not
significantly affected by the choice of these W matrices. Due to the time lag before export data is
available, the most relevant W matrix for forecasting is Wt-2 (export data two quarters before the
forecast point). Table 3 reports the RMSEs of forecasts corresponding to Wt-2. "Base model"
refers to the central estimates used in this paper (based on the model developed in (13)).
“Standard VAR” reports RSMEs of forecasts based on the standard VAR model that is
frequently used in other papers. Both models use the same variables and set p=4. In other words,
this forecasting exercise compares the non-linear model of export shares and output growth that

16

We only use forecasts up to four steps in order to focus on annual GDP growth rates. Growth rates
beyond four quarters provide minimal additional information because forecasted growth rates (beyond 4steps) are computed against a forecasted base.

is the focus of this paper with a simple, linear unrestricted VAR model of output growth that has
been used in other work.
===============
Table 3
===============
Table 3 shows that, as expected, forecast errors increase at longer forecast horizons. For
most countries, however, the estimates have fairly low errors and provide respectable forecasts.
The results for the base model developed in this paper are especially impressive when compared
to the RSMEs for the standard VAR that has traditionally been used in this literature for impulseresponse analysis.

6. IMPULSE-RESPONSE ANALYSIS
This section uses the model estimated above to calculate a series of impulse-response functions.
It shows how a shock to each country in the sample is predicted to directly and indirectly impact
other countries through bilateral-trade linkages and output-multiplier effects. In order to calculate
these impulse responses, we write the moving-average representation of (14) as:
∞

∞

i =0

i =0

y t = ∑ C i u t −i = ∑ C i ( B0 * W ) −1 ε t −i

(15)

where the Ci matrices are computed from the recursive relationship:

C 0 = I 12
i

C i = ∑ C i − j A j , i = 1,2,...
j =1

and if Ω is diagonal the impulse response matrix is C i ( B0 * W ) −1 . Thus the effect of a unit
shock in the jth country on itself and others at time t + i is given by ∂y t + i / ∂ε jt = C i b j , where bj
1
is the jth column of ( B0 * W ) − . Instead of a unit shock we may use a one-standard deviation

16

shock to account for the relative variability of different shocks. For diagonal Ω , using the result
1
1
1
1
that PΩP ′ = I , where P = diag (σ 1− , σ 2− ,...., σ n− ) , we can insert P − P in front of ε t −i in

(15) to obtain the standardized innovations vt = Pε t with Var (vt ) = I . The corresponding
impulse response matrix is C i ( B 0 * W ) −1 P −1 from which we obtain ∂y t +i / ∂ε jt = C i b j σ j , where

σ j is the innovation standard deviation of country j. Thus the impulse responses corresponding
to a unit shock can be re-scaled to obtain the effect of a shock of a desired magnitude.17
Next, we generate impulse responses for 20 quarters using two different W matrices:
from the fourth quarter of 1996 (before the Asian crisis) and from the second quarter of 1998
(during the Asian crisis). Since the export-share matrices are calculated as 12-quarter moving
averages, the two sets of impulse responses are very similar. To avoid repetition, we focus on
results obtained using the latter weighting matrix.
Figure 2 graphs the marginal impulse responses for U.S. GDP growth from a unit random
shock to each country/region in the sample. Not surprisingly, shocks to the U.S. and ROECD are
predicted to have the largest effect on the U.S. economy. The impact of a shock to the NIE4 is
predicted to be larger than a one-unit shock to Japan. In each case, most of the impact of the
shock affects the U.S. within the first year, and after about 4 quarters, the impulse responses are
very small and close to zero.
==============
Figure 3
==============

17

See Hamilton, 1994, Ch. 11. Ideally the structural model should be specified in such a way that

Ω becomes diagonal. Since Ω does not appear to be diagonal (Table 1) we resorted to using the

generalized impulse-response method advocated by Pesaran and Shin (1998). This procedure, however,
generated a large number of negative values. Therefore, we use C i ( B0 * W ) −1 to compute impulse
responses.

17

More informative than graphs of impulse responses are estimates of the multiplier effects
linking output growth across countries. Table 4 reports the cumulative impact of a one-unit,
positive shock in each country on the GDP growth of every country in the sample after four
quarters18. The column headings list the countries where the shocks originate, and the row
headings indicate the impacted countries. The last row of the table provides the standard
deviations of the regression residuals. These numbers can be used to gauge the relative
volatilities of structural shocks in different countries; multiplying each column by its standard
deviation provides the estimated effects of a one standard-deviation shock.
===============
Table 4
===============
Table 4 shows a number of patterns. First, in most cases a shock to each country has a
larger impact on growth within that country than on any other countries. Second, shocks to the
largest economies (Japan, the ROECD, and the U.S.) generally have larger predicted multiplier
effects than shocks to smaller countries. Third, one-unit shocks to China are often predicted to
have a larger impact than shocks to other Asian countries (with the exception of Japan) − despite
China being viewed as a fairly closed economy with relatively weak trade linkages with other
countries in the sample (as shown in Figure 1).
Fourth, shocks to the relatively small economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Thailand are predicted to have a substantial impact on other Asian economies, such as
Singapore and South Korea. This suggests that the spread of the Asian crisis from the ASEAN4
to the NIEs should not have been surprising. Finally, despite the relative proximity of Japan to
Asia, shocks to the ROECD and U.S. are predicted to have larger multiplier effects on most
Asian countries than shocks to Japan. For example, the average multiplier effect of a shock to the

18

Impulse responses show the presence of some seasonal effects. Cumulative responses at annual intervals

18

U.S. or ROECD on the Asian economies (excluding Japan) is almost 2 times the average impact
of a shock to Japan.19 According to these estimates, Asia is much more affected by a slowdown
in the U.S. economy than a comparable slowdown in Japan.
The statistics in Table 4 capture not only how a shock to one country directly impacts
other countries, but also the initial shock to one country spreads through a chain of output effects
in other countries. These indirect multiplier effects tend to be much larger and follow very
different patterns than would be predicted by focusing only on bilateral-trade flows between
countries. Table 5 makes this point by focusing on how individual countries are affected by
shocks that originate in other countries in the sample. In the “rank by exports” columns, the table
lists the main trading partners (ranked by export shares) of the country listed in the heading of
that section of the table. In the “ranked by multiplier” columns, the table lists the multiplier
effects on the country in the heading from a shock originating in each of the countries listed in
the rows. These multiplier effects are taken from Table 4 and then normalized by setting “owncountry” multipliers to unity. This removes the scaling effect that results from using one-unit
shocks versus one standard-deviation shocks.
===============
Table 5
===============
Table 5 clearly shows that the predicted impact of a shock working directly through
export flows can be very different than the predicted impact of a shock working through
multiplier effects on output growth and trade linkages between the entire sample of countries.
The table also shows a number of noteworthy patterns. First, and not surprisingly, shocks to the

remove this effect.
19
The average effect is calculated as the unweighted average of the individual effects on each Asian country
in the sample.

19

largest economies have the largest multiplier effects on other countries. For most countries in the
sample, the ROECD, U.S. and/or Japan are at the top of the “ranked by multiplier” column.
Second, shocks to a country’s most important bilateral-trade partners can be relatively
less important than shocks to other countries when the full multiplier effects are taken into
consideration. For example, Hong Kong is China's largest trading partner (and vice versa) and
Singapore is Malaysia's largest trading partner (and vice versa). According to the multiplier
effects, however, a one-unit shock to any of these countries would have less of an impact on their
main trading partner than a one unit shock to the ROECD or U.S. Third, direct trade flows from
Taiwan to China are small (with China at the bottom of Taiwan's list of export markets), but the
multiplier effect of a shock to China on Taiwan's GDP growth is predicted to be much larger.
This captures the fact that a large share of Taiwan's exports go to Hong Kong and are then reexported to China.
A final noteworthy point is the predicted impact of the Asian crisis on output growth in
Singapore and Taiwan. Singapore was much more affected by the crisis than Taiwan. According
to Table 5, the combined direct-trade effect from the main "crisis countries" (the sum of the
export effects from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) was 0.31
for Singapore and 0.11 for Taiwan. According to the output-multiplier effect, however, the
combined impact of the same crisis countries on Singapore was 1.0, whereas for Taiwan it was
only 0.63. In other words, the output-multiplier effect predicts that the impact of the Asian crisis
on Singapore relative to on Taiwan would be twice as large than if the crisis was just transmitted
via the direct direct-trade effect.

7. CONCLUSION
This paper develops a structural VAR model to estimate how a shock to one country affects
output in other countries. It focuses on two types of cross-country linkages: direct effects through

20

bilateral trade and indirect effects through output multipliers. Estimates suggest that outputmultiplier effects are large and capture an important transmission mechanism that is overlooked
in models using only a bilateral-trade matrix. A series of impulse-response functions shows that
due to these indirect multiplier effects, a shock to one country can have a large impact on other
countries that are relatively minor trading partners. These estimates provide insight on the
propagation and scope of the Asian crisis.
In order to estimate these direct trade linkages and output-multiplier effects, the paper
develops a VAR model that uses trade flows to link output growth across countries. This
structural model is a significant improvement over the VARs previously used in this literature. It
uses economic theory to construct a new series of identification assumptions that avoid overparameterisation and the need for arbitrary triangularization. A key contribution of this model is
that cross-country relationships are allowed to vary over time − a critical feature when estimating
relationships over long periods or after a crisis. Model estimates suggest that this methodology
not only provides relatively good forecasts, but also performs significantly better than the
standard VARs.
The framework and estimates of this paper could be extended in a number of directions.
For example, the sample of countries could be expanded and numerous variables could be added
to the model − from country-specific macroeconomic measures to cross-country financial flows.
Taken as a whole, however, the paper makes two important contributions. First, the framework
and modelling approach may be useful in a wide variety of other applications with a shortage of
realistic, theory-based identification restrictions. Second, the estimates suggest that indirect
cross-country linkages through output-multiplier effects are important determinants of how
shocks and crises are transmitted internationally.

DATA APPENDIX
The database consists of 12 GDP series and 132 export-share series (11 series for each of the 12
countries/regions). Each series includes quarterly data from the first quarter of 1975 through the
second quarter of 1998.
The GDP statistics were taken from a number of sources. The main source is the
International Financial Statistics CD-ROM and CEIC (Hong Kong based) which report constantprice, quarterly GDP statistics (expressed in local currencies).20 Some series were available in
seasonally adjusted form. Unadjusted series were seasonally adjusted using the X-11 procedure.
On several occasions, quarterly GDP statistics for Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, China
and Thailand had to be interpolated. This interpolation was done using the Chow-Lin relatedseries technique.21 The GDP data for the ROECD (all members of the OECD except Japan, South
Korea and the U.S.) was obtained from the International Statistical Yearbook (ISY) CD-ROM
and reported in constant U.S. dollars. The growth rates of this series closely match the growth
rates of the OECD GDP index available in the OECD Economic Indicators.22
Export data was obtained from the Direction of Trade Statistics (various issues), Taiwan
Economic Data Centre, and Taiwan Statistical Yearbook. Export data is reported as freight-onboard (f.o.b) in U.S. dollars. A number of adjustments had to be made to this data.
First, Singapore’s exports to Indonesia are not publicly available, although Indonesia
publishes data on imports from Singapore. Singapore’s export data rarely matches the import

20

The Japan GDP series on the IFS CDROM has a mistake for 1979 which we corrected using the CEIC
database.
21
A detailed analysis in Abeysinghe and Lee (1998) and Abeysinghe and Gulasekaran (2000) suggests that
these interpolated series are of good quality. These data series can be downloaded from
http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/ecstabey/Tilak.html.
22
The one exception is for 1980 when the ISY series reports a growth rate of 4.6 percent whereas the
Economic Indicators reports a growth rate of 1.2 percent. Since the former number appears to be a mistake,
we replaced the ISY quarterly growth rates for 1980 with statistics from the Economic Indicators and
worked out an index for the ROECD based on ROECD growth = (OECD growth-w1.US growth-w2.Japan
growth)/(1-w1-w2), where w1=0.3635 and w2=0.1491 are the 1990 PPP-based weights used for the U.S. and
Japan, respectively, in OECD GDP calculations.

22

data from other countries, however, because Singapore includes re-exports in its exports whereas
its trading partners often classify these re-exports as imports from the originating country.
Yamamoto and Noda (1997) show that as the re-export content of Singapore’s exports increases,
the “consistency ratio” (imports from Singapore recorded in the other country divided by
Singapore’s exports) falls. Since Malaysia has a similar pattern of trade and re-exports with
Singapore as Indonesia, we use Malaysia’s consistency ratio (0.61) to adjust the Indonesian
import series and derive the corresponding export share.
The second adjustment to the export data is for China. There are a number of gaps in
China’s export data. Therefore, we use imports from China reported by China’s trading partners
as estimates of China’s exports. It is also difficult to obtain trade data between China and
Taiwan. The best data source that we were able to find is from the Taiwan Economic Data
Center. This data shows that direct trade between the two countries was very small in the early
1990s. Most of the trade between Taiwan and China takes place through Hong Kong, in which
case the destination country is recorded as Hong Kong.

Note: (1) “Base Model” is the model developed in this paper and used as
the basis for estimation. “Standard VAR” is the model typically used in
previous work. The forecast period for both models is 1994Q1-1997Q2
and the weight matrix is Wt-2. Forecasts are GDP growth rates versus the
same quarter of the previous year. Parameter estimates for both models are
updated recursively.

Note: Each row shows the effect on that country’s GDP growth from a shock originating in the country listed in the given column. Values greater than 0.50 are written in bold, and values greater
than 0.25 (but less than 0.50) are written in italics, except own-country effects are not written in bold or italics. ASEAN4 is the sum of the effects of one-unit shocks to Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Thailand. NIE4 is the sum of the effects of one-unit shocks to Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. When applicable, member countries are excluded from each of these
sums. The last row provides standard deviations of the regression residuals (multiplied by 100 to facilitate readability).
