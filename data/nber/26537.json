    "abstract": "\n\nChina is planning to implement the largest CO\u2082 emissions trading system in the world.  To reduce emissions, the system will be a tradable performance standard (TPS), an emissions pricing mechanism that differs significantly from the emissions pricing instruments used in other countries, such as cap and trade (C&T) and a carbon tax.  We employ matching analytically and numerically solved models to assess the cost-effectiveness and distributional impacts of China\u2019s forthcoming TPS for achieving CO\u2082 emissions reductions from the power sector.\nWe find that the TPS\u2019s implicit subsidy to electricity output has wide-ranging consequences for both cost-effectiveness and distribution.  In terms of cost-effectiveness, the subsidy disadvantages the TPS relative to C&T by causing power plants to make less efficient use of output-reduction as a way of reducing emissions (indeed, it induces some generators to increase output) and by limiting the cost-reducing potential of allowance trading.  In our central case simulations, TPS\u2019s overall costs are about 47 percent higher than under C&T.  At the same time, the TPS has distribution-related attractions.  Through the use of multiple benchmarks (maximal emission-output ratios consistent with compliance), it can serve distributional objectives.  And because it yields smaller increases in electricity prices than a comparable C&T system, it implies less international emissions leakage.\n\n",
