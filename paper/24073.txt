Household Inequality and the Consumption Response to Aggregate Real Shocks

NBER Working Paper No. 24073
November 2017
JEL No. D15,E21
ABSTRACT
To what extent does household inequality affect the response of aggregate consumption to
aggregate real shocks? We first review two state-of-the-art papers with household heterogeneity
and aggregate uncertainty. They teach us that having a larger fraction of poor and borrowing
constrained households, who have a high marginal propensity to consume, amplifies the drop in
aggregate consumption in response to a negative aggregate real shock. We then move on to the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and Equifax data to quantify the fraction of people that
are constrained in their consumption choices and to study how that fraction has changed before
and after the Great Recession. We argue that the role of constraints cannot be adequately captured
by only having a large share of households with no wealth before a recession. We find that, for all
of the measures that we consider, the fraction of households that are borrowing constrained has
drastically increased since the onset of the Great Recession and that it has remained high, or even
increased, all the way through 2012, the last year for which we currently have PSID data. Thus, it
is not surprising that aggregate consumption has experienced such a large drop and remained
depressed for a long time.

Introduction

The drop in output and consumption that occurred during the Great Recession
has been large and prolonged. Figure 1 displays per-capita U.S. real gross domestic
product (GDP) and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) between 1985 and
2016 and highlights the large drop in both consumption and output that occurred
starting in 2007 and its parallel shift compared to the previous trend. In this paper,
we ask why consumption has dropped so much and has been recovering so slowly. We
also ask to what extent household inequality before and after the Great Recession
interacted with the recession itself to generate such a large and persistent drop in
consumption.
To reach our goal, we first review two key papers, Krusell and Smith (1998)
and Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016), and summarize what we understand from
quantitative macro models with aggregate uncertainty about wealth inequality, borrowing constrained households with heterogeneous marginal propensities to consume
(MPCs), and the response of aggregate consumption to an aggregate shock. The key
message from macroeconomic theory is that the extent to which households are borrowing constrained (which in these models means how many people have low wealth
holdings) and how that changes both over time and with aggregate shocks are cru-

2

cial in explaining the aggregate economy’s response and the speed of its recovery.
That is, versions of these models with a realistic fraction of poor people can generate
larger consumption drops in response to a total factor productivity (TFP) shock than
models with fewer poor people. Hence, inequality does affect aggregate consumption
dynamics in response to shocks in an important way.
While these papers provide very important lessons and are much more realistic
than previous models, we argue that these newer models still abstract from important
changes that happened during the Great Recession and are thus likely to understate
the size (and potentially the persistence) of the consumption drop that occurred and
the role of household inequality in generating it. First, they do not incorporate the
large wealth losses (due to drops in house prices and in stock market values) that
occurred during the Great Recession and have depressed aggregate consumption due
to a negative wealth effect. Second, they take the view that there is only one asset
and that borrowing constrained people are largely people with low amounts of this
composite asset. However, the composition of a household’s portfolio is important to
determine the extent to which the household is borrowing constrained. For instance,
in a model with liquid and illiquid assets that are subject to adjustment costs, people
might have significant holdings of illiquid wealth and still be borrowing constrained
(Kaplan and Violante, 2014). Thus, these models understate the fraction of households that are borrowing constrained and hence the size of the associated consumption
drop. Third, these models assume that financial frictions are constant, including during a large downturn. In contrast, credit standards tightened considerably during the
Great Recession, which also tends to reduce consumption (Guerrieri and Lorenzoni
2017). Fourth, these models assume that only unemployment risk changes over the
cycle while there is significant evidence that earnings risk conditional on being employed is asymmetric: large earnings drops are much more likely than large earnings
increases and this asymmetry becomes more pronounced during recessions (Guvenen,
Ozkan, and Song 2014). If a household perceives higher earnings risk during a recession, it would likely cut consumption and increase savings, thus generating an even
larger drop in aggregate consumption.
Thus, all four of these factors likely increase the size of the consumption drop
that is related to household inequality because they increase the fraction of borrowing
constrained households that have high marginal propensities to consume (MPC) and
whose consumption reacts more strongly to a negative aggregate shock. Interestingly,
3

these factors do not apply symmetrically to all households. For instance, the wealth
drop is more important for households in the top half of the wealth distribution, while
credit market access plays a larger role for low-wealth households who lack alternative
means of smoothing consumption. Accounting for these factors can thus improve
the ability of the current models to match cross-sectional patterns of consumption
responses.
One important implication of the four features that are missing in these macro
benchmark models is that we should think more carefully how to best measure the
fraction of households that are borrowing constrained and how this fraction changes
over time and the business cycle. It is important to stress that the fraction of households that are borrowing constrained is not just the fraction of low wealth households,
but also depends on their portfolio composition, exposure to earnings risk, and, potentially, on what non-discretionary expenses they expect (Campbell and Hercowitz
2016). We thus need a better measure of borrowing constrained households.
To help shed light on these important issues, we use the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID) and credit bureau panel data (Equifax) to examine the interaction
between consumption, wealth inequality, and borrowing constraints during the Great
Recession. We find that, consistent with the models’ implications, the poor and
borrowing constrained households have a larger consumption expenditure rate as a
fraction of their income and that their expenditure rate dropped by more during the
Great Recession. We then use various measures of borrowing constraints to get a sense
of how the fraction of constrained households has changed over time. We document
that, for all of the measures that we consider, the fraction of households that are
borrowing constrained has drastically increased since the onset of the Great Recession
and has remained high, or even increased, all the way to 2012, the last year for which
we currently have PSID data. Thus, it is not surprising that aggregate consumption
has experienced such a large drop and remained depressed for a long time. Before
turning to our data analysis, we now discuss what we know from macroeconomic
theory in more detail.

Krusell and Smith “Income and Wealth Heterogeneity in the Macroeconomy,” 1998

To better discuss the forces at play, let us remind ourselves of the crucial features
of Krusell and Smith’s (KS) model. The consumers are infinitely-lived, provide labor
inelastically, and optimally choose how much to save and consume. They are ex-ante
identical but get hit by an unemployment shock. Markets are incomplete: there is
only one asset, aggregate capital, and consumers cannot borrow. The model induces
endogenous wealth inequality: although households face the same stochastic process
for an endowment shock, they receive different sequences of the unemployment shock
and are thus ex-post heterogeneous in their wealth holdings.
There is an aggregate shock that affects total factor productivity of both capital
and labor (TFP) in the aggregate production function and the aggregate unemployment rate. A recession in this framework is thus characterized by lower aggregate
wages and higher unemployment. The equilibrium interest rate is the marginal product of capital. The equilibrium wage is the marginal product of labor. Due to the
aggregate shocks, both the interest rate and the wage fluctuate over time. Thus,
because of aggregate uncertainty, consumers have to forecast future prices (both the
wage and the interest rate). In principle, the whole distribution of wealth, together
with the aggregate shock, is a state variable to forecast future prices.
We learn two main lessons from this paper. The first one is that today’s average
capital, or net worth, is enough to forecast future prices for given aggregate shock
and that we thus need to keep track of only one moment of the wealth distribution.
The second main lesson from this paper is that the first result can still imply that
the response of the aggregate time series depends on the distribution of wealth and
the fraction of people that are constrained. In fact, the second moments of the
aggregate time series in models with incomplete markets are different from those with
a representative agent. Especially in models with more realistic wealth inequality,
there is a larger correlation between consumption and income.
The key insight in these models with incomplete markets is that different saving
(and consumption) propensities are associated with low levels of wealth. As wealth
increases, the marginal propensity to save converges to one (permanent income behavior) and thus aggregates up across agents. Because the agents with lowest and most
heterogeneous propensity to save (and highest to consume) are associated with low
5

wealth levels, they have very little effect on aggregate capital and prices, as opposed
to the high-wealth agents whose policy functions aggregate. In contrast, because
the poor have a high marginal propensity to consume, they account for a significant
amount of aggregate consumption. Moreover, because they have little wealth to insulate their consumption from aggregate shocks affecting wages and income, they also
have the largest consumption fluctuations over the cycle.

Krueger, Mitman, and Perri “Macroeconomics
and Household Heterogeneity,” 2016

Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (KMP) extend the KS’s framework with preference
heterogeneity to include a stylized life-cycle structure with constant probabilities of
aging or dying in each sub-period (working period and retirement), labor productivity
shocks conditional on employment, and unemployment insurance.
Their key finding is that, in these economies, the decline in aggregate consumption to an aggregate shock is larger in an economy populated by more wealth-poor
households because their consumption responds more strongly to aggregate shocks,
which are characterized by a reduction in TFP and increased unemployment risk.

Figure 2 displays the consumption functions (plotted against individual wealth
on the x-axis) and the pre-recession wealth distributions for the original KS economy
(left hand side) and the KMP economy (both graphs are from KMP). The lines
represent the consumption functions of the employed in an expansion, the employed
in a recession, and the unemployed in a recession. Thus, for a given wealth level, the
vertical difference between the consumption functions for the employed in the good
aggregate state and the employed in the bad aggregate state gives the consumption
drop in a large recession, conditional on the aggregate state switching but on not losing
a job. In the same way, the vertical difference between the consumption function of
the employed in an expansion and the consumption function of an unemployed in a
recession shows the consumption drop for a household that experiences a recession
and unemployment at the same time.
The figure reveals several interesting features. First, for a given level of wealth,
the drop in consumption is larger in the original KS economy and especially so for
households with little to no assets. Second, while there are almost no people in this
situation in the original KS economy, there are many more households in those wealth
quantiles in the KMP economy. It should be noted that average wealth is the same in
the two economies. As it turns out, the KMP economy displays a larger consumption
drop than the KS economy precisely because there are more people at low wealth
holdings. Figure 3 (also from KMP) highlights this result.

Results from the models, a discussion leading to
our data analysis

These two papers stress the importance of modeling heterogeneity and constrained
households in understanding aggregate consumption and output dynamics. However,
these models abstract from features of the Great Recession that are likely important
in understanding the behavior of aggregate consumption during and after that recession. For example, while the additional heterogeneity in KMP deepens the initial
consumption drop, it recovers at the same rate as the KS model. The richer dimensions of heterogeneity we document could potentially help future models match both
the steep initial decline and slow recovery in consumption as observed in the Great
Recession.
The features we consider include, first, changes in the value of wealth holdings
(and thus the fraction of poor households) due to drops in house prices and financial
asset valuation. Second, we study the implications of the observation that the asset
structure is much richer than just one asset. A household’s portfolio allocation and its
liquidity can have crucial implications for who is constrained (the wealthy-hand-tomouth). Third, changes in credit constraints that occurred, due to changes in credit
conditions during the downturn, are likely important. Fourth, we examine changes
in earnings risk for the employed in recessions and expansions. We know that the
distribution of earnings displays more negative skewness in recessions, for instance.
It is also possible that the persistence of earnings might depend on the status of the
aggregate economy and one’s earning level.
We now turn to discussing key aspects of the data and the strengths and weaknesses of the models in explaining empirical consumption dynamics after large shocks.

Data
Panel Study of Income Dynamics

We utilize the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to analyze the relationship between household inequality and consumption dynamics. The PSID has two
important advantages from the standpoint of the questions that we are asking. First,
it provides information on earnings, income, consumption, and wealth for a sample
8

that is representative of the U.S. population. Second, it has a panel dimension that
allows us to track households over time in addition to performing cross-sectional investigations. The latter allows us to check how wealth and consumption have changed
for the same households.
We use data from the 2001 to 2013 PSID waves (covering the years 2000 to 2012),
with particular focus on 2004, 2006, and 2010. Our baseline sample in these years
consists of families with household heads aged 25 to 60. We also exclude a few
households whose total annual consumption is implausibly small, less than $1000 in
2006 dollars. Our wealth quintiles are defined over this working-age sample. When
analyzing changes over time, we make these restrictions only in the base year. Much
of our analysis focuses on three variables: total income, consumption expenditures,
and net worth. All dollar values are deflated to 2006 using the Consumer Price Index
unless otherwise stated.
Total income includes all pre-tax sources of household income from all family
members, including Social Security income and other transfers, as well as a family’s
income from assets and businesses. Transfer income includes unemployment compensation, transfers from other family members, and welfare benefits, among others.
Total income also includes retirement and pension income. Net worth is composed of
net housing equity, net value of other real estate, net value of farm or business, net
value of vehicles, value of annuities and retirement accounts, value of non-retirement
investments and savings, and the net value of other assets less the value of other
liabilities. After 2010, the value of other liabilities is subdivided into credit card
debt, student loans, medical bills, legal bills, and other family loan debt. In the
analysis that considers illiquid housing wealth, we only look at the net equity in the
primary home and other real estate. Net worth does not include the present value of
defined-benefit pension income.
While the PSID harmonizes the variables for total family income and net worth,
we must construct consumption expenditures using disparate expenditure categories.
This is created from expenditures on transportation, vehicles purchased in the current
year, food, clothing, education, child care, entertainment, recreation, vacation, utilities, rent, imputed rents for homeowners, property tax, household repairs, household
durables, homeowner’s insurance, out-of-pocket medical care, and health insurance
premiums. As in KMP, the imputed rental value for homeowners is calculated by
multiplying the total value of a household’s home by an interest rate of 4%. Due to
9

the limited availability of variables, this definition of consumption is only available for
2004 onwards as expenditures on clothing, entertainment, recreation, vacation, household durables, and household repairs are not collected prior to this. All expenditure
variables are adjusted to an annual frequency.1

5.2

Equifax

We also make use of the Equifax-FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), which
is a longitudinal dataset containing quarterly credit bureau records for a nationally
representative 5% random sample of individual borrowers. The CCP database also
includes records of all household members of the primary sample borrower. These
data include information on all aspects of individual and household-level credit and
debt, which includes credit cards, auto loans, student debt, as well as first- and
second-lien mortgages. The data also include individual credit scores and the number
of credit applications, which allow us to track household creditworthiness and demand
for credit over time.

Important dimensions of heterogeneity in the
PSID

We begin by discussing several key empirical facts from the PSID.2 Table 1 reports
the marginal distributions of earnings, income, consumption expenditures, and net
worth in 2006, on the eve of the recession. All of these measures of household wellbeing are very unevenly distributed, but some more so than others.
Labor earnings are heavily concentrated at the top, with the top quintile accounting for 47% of all earnings and the top 5 percent of the distribution receiving 21%. In
comparison, total income, which includes transfer income, is somewhat more evenly
distributed. The distribution of consumption expenditures, while still skewed, is the
least extreme – whereas households in the bottom two quintiles of labor earnings account for 11.9% of the total, the bottom two consumption quintiles make up 18.3% of
1

We calculate similar results to KMP. See their paper for a comparison between aggregates in
the PSID and National Income and Product Accounts.

total consumption. It is the inequality in wealth holdings that is by far the starkest –
the top 5% of the distribution account for nearly half of the aggregate wealth, while
the bottom 40% of the population hold almost no net worth at all.

For the moment, we will take net worth as a measure of household constraints,
since less wealthy households are likely less able to respond to shocks. How much
do wealth-poor households contribute to aggregate consumption? To answer this
question, Table 2 reports the distribution of several variables, conditional on wealth
quintile in 2006. It reveals that asset-poor households make up a sizeable measure of
aggregate consumption expenditures. In fact, the bottom two wealth quintiles account
for 30% of expenditures in 2006. Not surprisingly, households in these quintiles spend
much higher shares of their total income on consumption (expenditure rates).

Table 3 shows that the low-wealth quintiles are populated by households that are
younger, less educated, have low propensities to own homes or financial assets, and
are less likely to hold full-time employment throughout the year, as evidenced both
by the number of hours worked and prevalence of unemployment spells. The data
in these tables corroborate the essential ingredients of KMP: (1) a large fraction of
households have no assets but account for a significant part of aggregate consumption,
and (2) these households are vulnerable to shocks, as their low asset positions are
compounded by lower levels of human capital, whether acquired through schooling or
work experience.

How did these household groups respond to the Great Recession? Table 4 reports
annualized nominal changes in select variables before and during the Great Recession,
conditional on initial wealth quintile. These changes are computed holding initial
quintile composition fixed. For instance, to compute the change in consumption
expenditures for households in the bottom wealth quintile between 2004 and 2006,
12

we take all households in that quintile in 2004 and compute their mean consumption
expenditures in 2004 and in 2006. The annualized change in these means is reported
in the table. Changes in expenditure rates are constructed similarly but are reported
as percentage point differences.
The top row of Table 4 shows aggregate growth rates that tell a familiar tale of
the Great Recession. After expanding at a pace of 14.1% during the boom years,
aggregate net worth declined at an annual rate of 3.4% between 2006 and 2010. The
growth rate of aggregate total income also slowed down from 2.6% to only 0.8% per
year. However, the slowdown in aggregate consumption proved to be much faster:
after increasing at an average rate of 5.5% per year, consumption fell at an average rate
of 0.8% between 2006 and 2010. These relative movements in growth rates of income
and consumption are reflected in absolute declines in the aggregate expenditure rate.
A convenient metric for measuring the effect of the Great Recession is the change
in nominal growth rates between the 2004-06 and 2006-10 periods. The Great Recession depressed total income growth for all wealth groups but in a non-monotonic
fashion. Households in the middle of the wealth distribution (quintiles 3 and 4) experienced the greatest slowdown, while for those at the lowest quintile total income
growth decelerated much less (-0.6 percent per year). Consumption growth rates also
decreased for all wealth groups, with the slowdown again being most severe in the
middle of the wealth distribution. Low wealth households experienced a slowdown in
consumption growth that was barely above those in the highest wealth quintile and
well below those in quintiles 3 and 4. This finding is consistent with results in Meyer
and Sullivan (2013), which documents a decline in consumption inequality during the
Great Recession. They show that the fall in asset prices (both housing and financial)
had a disproportionate effect on households with higher ex-ante consumption levels.
Importantly, slowdowns in consumption growth were larger than drops in income
growth for all wealth groups. As a result, the share of income spent on consumption
(expenditure share) declined for all wealth groups, but the poorest households experienced the largest decline. This empirical fact is consistent with the main intuition
of the KMP model: when unemployment risk rises, low-wealth households cut back
consumption because they fail to accumulate wealth that can be used to smooth consumption fluctuations. This happens whether they actually become unemployed or
not. In the latter case, they cut consumption to build up their precautionary savings
given the heightened unemployment risk during a recession.

Matching heterogeneous patterns in the data

As shown in figure 3, the KMP model delivers a larger response to an aggregate
recession shock than a model with a smaller wealth dispersion. It thus matches
important aspects of the data and shows that an economy with borrowing constrained
agents can generate larger drops in aggregate consumption. As shown in Table 5, the
KMP model does well in matching heterogeneity in declines in disposable income.
It also captures the qualitative ordering of recession-driven changes in expenditure
rates, as low-wealth households react more to the recessionary shock than high-wealth
households.

KMP calculate disposable, post-tax income and use this in their model. Since our analysis uses
only pre-tax income, we report both their data and model results for this field. All other data results
report our own computations.

However, the Great Recession was associated with large wealth losses, tightening
of borrowing constraints, and increased earnings uncertainty. These forces would take
the model even closer to the data. They could further reduce aggregate consumption
growth and amplify the consumption response relative to income drops. They could
further contribute to a slow recovery in consumption. Because wealth losses fall
unevenly across the distribution, the implied reductions in consumption growth rates
would be heterogeneous.

Additional elements of the Great Recession
Shocks to wealth

Unlike the baseline model, the Great Recession was characterized by substantial
declines in household wealth. Figure 4 demonstrates the leftward shift in distribution of household wealth between the 2006 and the 2010 PSID surveys. The share of
households with negative net worth jumped from 16% to 24%, and the mean household net worth plummeted from $324,973 to $197,780 in 2006 dollars. In the context
of the KMP model, this drop in household net worth could reinforce the negative consumption dynamics by altering the wealth distribution in Figure 2. Put differently, a
recession that brings about a sizeable leftward shift in the wealth distribution elicits
an additional consumption response, especially among households who bear the brunt
of this shock.

We can get some additional insight into these consumption dynamics by exploiting the panel structure of the PSID and linking changes in wealth with changes in
consumption at the household level. Table 6 presents the shift in the distribution
of household wealth between 2006 and 2010 as transitions across fixed net worth
quintiles, defined by their 2006 threshold values. Each row of the table shows the
distribution of households in a given wealth quintile in 2006 across wealth groupings
in 2010. For example, 43.8% of households in the middle quintile of 2006 net worth
distribution remained in the same group by 2010. However, more than 1/3 of households in this quintile (12.5%+22.9%) lost enough wealth by 2010 to drop into the
bottom two quintiles. The table also captures the consumption growth rates for each
of these groups, located in the brackets below the transition probabilities. Looking
at households that moved from the middle quintile in 2006 to the bottom quintiles
in 2010 shows that the deterioration in their wealth position was accompanied by
massive reductions in consumption of about 3% per year. Table 6 shows that, in
general, downward movements in wealth (the lower diagonal part of the transition
matrix) are associated with negative consumption growth rates, shown in red. The
lower subpanel of the table again underscores the shift in the wealth distribution: the
bottom quintile in 2006 (< $2,500 in net worth) by construction accounted for 20%
of households, but 23.7% of households found themselves with less than $2,500 in net
worth in 2010.

Shocks to composition of wealth

Housing equity represents the single largest wealth component for the majority of
households, although it is illiquid. During the run up to the Great Recession, financial innovations made it much easier for households to use housing equity to support
consumption, either by extracting it directly or by borrowing against it (Bhutta and
Keys 2016). Case, Quigley, and Shiller (2013) estimate propensities to consume out
of different types of wealth by analyzing changes in per capita consumption expenditures, income, financial wealth, and housing wealth in a quarterly panel of U.S. states
spanning 1975 to 2012. They find much higher elasticities of consumption with respect to housing compared with financial wealth and attribute this result to changes
in tax laws and the above-mentioned financial innovations. Thus, a drop in house
values could further contribute to the drop in consumption.
Figure 5 again exploits the panel structure of PSID to show the distribution of
individual changes in real housing wealth between 2006 and 2010, expressed in annualized, real percentage terms. The smaller figures show the unconditional distribution in
each 2006 wealth quintile, while the top figure shows the overall distribution, which is
the sum of the smaller histograms. The overall distribution of housing wealth changes

17

(top panel) was strongly asymmetric as many households experienced losses in real
terms. On average, housing wealth declined by an average of 6.4% per year over this
period and as many as 17.8% of PSID homeowners lost all of their housing wealth,
whether through foreclosure (the -100% group) or by owing more than their house
was worth (the “underwater” or <-100% group). The rest of the panels show the
unconditional distributions of changes for each of the 2006 wealth groups. In these
panels, non-homeowners and those with little housing wealth in 2006 are omitted and
thus the sum over all the bins in each panel will roughly equal the homeownership
rate for that quintile. Consequently, the histograms for the bottom two wealth quintiles suggest that housing losses there were limited because of low ownership rates.
However, the rest of the wealth distribution was hit hard. In the middle quintile,
complete loss of all housing equity represented the likeliest outcome. Although foreclosures were not nearly as common in the top wealth deciles, the share of households
facing losses was even greater.

Changes in credit accessibility

The figures above describe erosion in housing wealth, which is commonly used as
collateral. However, in addition to experiencing negative wealth shocks, households
were also faced with a more adverse credit environment with the onset of the Great
Recession. Lenders tightened their credit standards for home mortgages and other
credit products. Moreover, as delinquency rates rose across credit markets, household
19

90

00

FICO scores deteriorated, which further contributed to difficulties in accessing credit.
To get some sense of magnitudes of the shock to credit access, we turn to the
Equifax panel data. Figure 6 shows the distribution of FICO scores in a representative sample of households in 2006 and for the same sample in 2010. Unlike household
wealth, the distribution of credit scores did not shift uniformly to the left. Rather, by
2010, the FICO score distribution became much thinner in the middle range of creditworthiness (690-790) and more concentrated at the very top. On net, the fraction
of households that remained above the informal mid-point of the prime credit score
range (FICO = 720) was nearly unchanged.
Instead, it was the tightening of minimum credit standards, shown by the dashed
vertical lines, that pushed a large fraction of households out of credit markets. As
shown in Figure 7, a FICO score of 720 roughly corresponded to the median score
of a borrower approved for a home mortgage by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac prior to
the Great Recession. Over this time period, households with credit scores between
680 and 780 – the “prime” group in Figure 8 – experienced a success rate above
80% in getting their credit applications approved. Applying a FICO score of 720 as
a notional cutoff for ready credit access to the distribution in Figure 6 places 47%
of households in this category. However, by 2010, the same criteria for ready credit
access – obtaining mortgage credit from the GSEs or having undiminished success
rates for credit applications – required a credit score of about 780. This shift in
credit requirements, shown by the red dashed line, shrank the fraction of households
with easy credit access to just under 30%.

FICO score

Evidence of credit tightening during the Great Recession can be seen in the
Equifax data on median FICO scores for newly originated mortgages depicted in Figure 7. Stricter credit requirements are apparent both for mortgages backed by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac as well as for mortgages for first-time homebuyers explicitly
guaranteed by the U.S. Government through the Federal Housing Agency (FHA) or
the Veterans Administration (VA). The same phenomenon is also illustrated by a
sizable dip in success rates of credit applications in Figure 8, which includes not only
mortgages but also auto loans and credit cards. This decline is especially pronounced
for the lowest FICO score borrowers, who tend to be young and/or lower-income.
Altogether, this negative shock to the accessibility of credit likely contributed to the
observed patterns of substantial slowdowns in consumption growth and expenditure
rates, especially at the bottom of the wealth distribution.

The persistence of various measures of credit tightening mirrors changes in household constraints, as shown in Figure 9 for several metrics. The top-left panel presents
absolute measures of household wealth below a certain threshold. The top-right panel
depicts measures of household wealth relative to their earnings or income. The bottom
panel captures the share of households whose FICO scores are below the threshold
commonly employed by mainstream financial institutions. All of these measures paint
the same picture and tell us that the share of constrained households increased dramatically with the onset of the Great Recession and has showed no signs of decline
through 2012. Since current models do not explain the slow recovery of consumption

22

with simply a large fraction of poor households, the persistence of these constraints
means that this channel could hold particular promise in bringing existing models in
line with realistic consumption dynamics.

Changes in earnings risk

Table 7 discusses changes in some statistics of the labor market by net worth
quintiles. First, it shows that unemployment increased during the Great Recession
and especially so for those in the bottom wealth quintile. Second, it highlights that
there were also large changes in hours and the fraction of people working and that
both are U-shaped in wealth quintiles. In the baseline models, unemployment is the
only labor market dynamic that changes (exogenously) during the cycle and does so
independently of one’s wealth level. Thus, the labor market dynamics of the model
abstract from important features of labor supply.

Other studies also found that earnings conditional on employment exhibit different dynamics over the business cycle. For instance, Guvenen, Ozkan, and Song (2014)
find that the left-skewness of earnings shocks is strongly countercyclical: during recessions, large upward earnings movements become less likely whereas large drops in
earnings become more likely. Both KS and KMP do not account for these important
dynamics. The fact that negative earnings shocks become more likely in a recession is
another force reducing consumption and increasing savings and might help bring the
consumption response to aggregate shocks in the model more in line with the data.
This asymmetric increase in negative earnings risk during downturns holds promise
in explaining the persistently languid consumption growth after the Recession, particularly among the poorest households, in addition to the initially steep decline.
For example, Pistaferri (2016) runs regressions on changes in wealth and disposable
income using pre-2008 aggregate data to predict consumption responses and then ex24

trapolates these for the post-2008 period. He finds that consumption has recovered
significantly slower than would be expected based on the historical data (a finding
corroborated in our Figure 1), but that accounting for household leverage and consumer confidence appears to explain the entire gap between observed and extrapolated
trends. While the influence of the deleveraging process on reduced consumption has
probably softened, he finds that factors influencing consumer confidence have not. In
particular, pessimism is strongest amongst the lowest quartile of the income distribution who report worse expectations and increased uncertainty concerning financial
conditions. These households also exhibit a permanent rise in the expected probability of job loss, not unlike the long-lasting aversion to financial risk documented among
households who experienced the macroeconomic shock of the Great Depression (Malmendier and Nagel 2011). This indicates that the Recession could be seen as being
characterized by both permanent negative shocks to income and persistent increases
in income uncertainty (De Nardi, French, and Benson 2012). The prevalence of this
pessimism amongst the poorest households underscores the importance of accounting
for earnings dynamics in models of household heterogeneity.

Conclusion

This paper highlights a number of theoretical and empirical reasons established
by earlier literature for the importance of household heterogeneity in understanding
macroeconomic responses to shocks. In particular, we focus on identifying households
who are constrained in their consumption choices. These households typically have
a high marginal propensity to consume. Their prevalence in the economy and the
nature of their constraints have a sizable impact on consumption dynamics.
While incorporating a realistic degree of wealth heterogeneity is crucial for generating plausible consumption responses, we argue that the role of constraints cannot
be adequately captured by only having a large share of households with no wealth
before a recession. This is particularly true in the case of slowdowns like the Great
Recession, which delivered a strong negative shock not just to earnings, but also to
wealth itself. We show that accounting for shocks to different types of wealth may
also help explain consumption responses in the middle of the wealth distribution.
Also, it is important to take into account supply-side changes in the availability of
credit, which may further amplify the magnitude of the consumption response, especially among younger and less wealthy households. Finally, changes in the nature of
earnings risks during booms and expansions should be taken into account.
