Foreign Ownership and Employment Growth in Indonesian Manufacturing
Robert E. Lipsey, Fredrik Sjöholm, and Jing Sun
NBER Working Paper No. 15936
April 2010
JEL No. F23,J21,J23
ABSTRACT
Many developing countries would like to increase the share of modern or formal sectors in their employment.
One way to accomplish this goal may be to encourage the entrance of foreign firms. They are typically
relatively large, with high productivity and good access to foreign markets, and might therefore be
better at creating jobs than domestic firms are. However, previous research on the issue has been limited
by the paucity of long data sets for firm operations.

We examine employment growth in Indonesia in a large panel of plants between 1975 and 2005, and
especially in plants taken over by foreign owners from domestic ones. Employment growth is relatively
high in foreign-owned establishments, although foreign firms own relatively large domestic plants,
which in general grow more slowly than smaller plants. For plants that change the nationality of ownership
during our period, we find a strong effect of shifts from domestic to foreign ownership in raising the
growth rate of employment, but no significant effects of shifts from foreign to domestic ownership.
The faster growth of employment in the foreign-owned plants in general is concentrated in the takeovers,
especially in the year of acquisition. Foreign takeover of a domestically-owned plant, on average, brings
a large immediate expansion of employment.

1. Introduction
One of the possible consequences of inward foreign direct investments (FDI) for
developing countries, and one that is of particular interest to their governments, is the
extent to which the investment creates new jobs in the industrial, or “modern” sector, to
help in the transformation of the economies. Lewis’ (1954) notion of a need to move
people out of agriculture and into the modern sector is still a goal for many developing
countries (Asian Development Bank, 2005). There are several ways in which inward FDI
might play this role.
There is considerable evidence that foreign-owned firms are relatively efficient,
and may for that reason have access to foreign markets that would not be within the reach
of domestically-owned firms. They may also have wider contacts and knowledge of
world markets and better access to financing, all advantages that should provide a
positive effect on their employment.1 On the other side, the foreign-owned firms may
compete with domestically-owned firms for some markets, so that the losses of
employment by domestically-owned firms may offset, to some extent, the gains in the
foreign-owned firms. In addition, the foreign-owned firms may tend to be more capitalintensive than domestically-owned firms, and more intensive in the use of imported
intermediate products, so that an increase in their sales adds less to employment than
would a corresponding increase by domestically-owned firms.
In this paper, we use Indonesian manufacturing plant level data between 1975 and
2005 to analyze the effect of FDI on employment. We first compare rates of employment

growth in foreign-owned and domestically-owned plants.

Second, we examine

employment growth after foreign acquisitions of domestically-owned establishment and
domestic acquisitions of foreign-owned establishments. These observations hold constant
the identity of the individual establishment, although not its characteristics. If foreign
ownership provides superior technology or better access to world markets, establishments
should tend to raise their employment after foreign takeovers. If these advantages require
continued foreign ownership, there may be employment losses when a foreign-owned
establishment is acquired by a domestic firm. On the other hand, if the technological or
other gains from foreign ownership are retained in the establishment, its level and growth
of employment may continue after a domestic acquisition.
Acquisitions may not be random with respect to the prospects for the target
establishment. In order to control for unobservable firm characteristics that could involve
selection bias in foreign acquisitions, we combine propensity score matching techniques
with the more general difference in differences estimator. To test whether any effects are
due to changes between foreign and domestic ownership, we examine both domesticallyowned establishments that are acquired by foreign owners and foreign-owned
establishments that are acquired by domestic owners.

2. Foreign plants in Indonesian manufacturing
We analyze Indonesian manufacturing data supplied by the Indonesian Statistical
Office for the period, 1975 to 2005 for all manufacturing plants with more than 20

3

employees. A plant identification code enables us to construct a panel and follow
individual plants over time.
Employment in manufacturing plants with more than 20 employees increased
from fewer than seven hundred thousand in 1975 to about 4 million in 1997 and later
years (Figure 1). That growth was driven mainly by a strong increase in employment in
domestically-owned private plants, which remained close to three quarters of all plants
during the entire period. Foreign establishments have played an increasing role in
Indonesian manufacturing employment. Plants with some foreign ownership, accounting
for less than 10 percent of manufacturing employment in 1975, employed around 20
percent in 1997, at the time of the Asian crisis. After that the share declined slightly, but
then recovered to 20 percent again in 2005. The share of government-owned plants, much
larger than that of foreign plants in 1975, shrank steadily after the late 1980s, and was
only 5 percent of manufacturing employment in 2005.
The industry sectors and the ownership groups differed in some important aspects.
One extreme difference was in size: government-owned plants were far larger than
domestically-owned private plants, five times as large, on average, in 1975 and still over
three times as large in 2005. They were much larger also within the industry groups, with
a few exceptions (Table 1). Foreign-owned plants were also much larger than
domestically-owned private plants, about three times as large in both beginning and end
years. In 2005, the foreign-owned plants were larger than domestically-owned private
plants in every group. The size disparity may be an element in the frequency and success
of takeovers.

4

To the extent that we can associate the share of blue-collar workers in total
employment with the average skill level in an establishment, it appears that foreign firms
tended to use a slightly higher skill labor force than private domestic firms in the same
industry. Government-owned plants operated with the lowest proportions of blue-collar
workers consistently across almost all industries. Only government-owned plants
employed work forces made up to the extent of 30 percent or more of white-collar
workers, almost 40 percent in a few cases, while private domestic plants employed more
than 20 percent white-collar workers in only one industry group in one year.
The changes in the share of Indonesian manufacturing employment in foreignowned plants, discussed above, came about in several different ways.

One was

takeovers of domestically-owned plants by foreign firms, offset by takeovers of foreignowned plants by Indonesian owners. Another was the establishment of new plants by
foreign owners and the demise of existing plants A third source of change was any
differences in average rates of growth in employment between locally-owned and
foreign-owned plants.
These different sources of growth of employment in foreign owned plants are
shown in Table 2. Up through 1989, foreign takeovers accounted for a large part of total
growth in employment in foreign-owned manufacturing establishments, but they were
offset by declines in such employment from local takeovers of foreign-owned plants.
After 1989, the foreign takeovers added more to the foreign-owned share than the
domestic takeovers took away.
The path of takeover activity between foreign and domestic owners, in terms of
numbers of takeovers, is described by Figure 2. The numbers of takeovers had been
5

fairly similar in the two directions until the 1990s, but since then, foreign takeovers have
been more numerous, except in 1997, during the Asian crisis. However, the net effect of
foreign and domestic takeovers was less important as a source of employment growth in
foreign-owned establishments than the combination of the establishment of new foreignowned plants and their more rapid growth.

3. Econometric approach
We begin the econometric analysis by treating growth in employment as a
function of various plant characteristics:
Δln Lit  ln Lit  ln Lit1  α  λPlantit1   βwOwnership
i   t Year_ dummy 

 βind Ind _ dummyj   R Reg_ dummy εit

,

(1)

where i indexes firms, and t indexes year.
The variables included in the model are:
L:

Employment.

Plant:

A vector of lagged plant characteristics, i.e. plant size measured by
employment, energy intensity (quantity of energy per employee), which
is a proxy for physical capital intensity, and inputs of intermediate
goods, defined as raw materials, fuel, and lubricants, per employee

Ownershipi :

Ownership dummy variables indicating three ownership categories,
private domestically-owned, private foreign-owned, and governmentowned.

6

Dummy variables for year, industry (two-digit ISIC), and region (provinces aggregated
into 5 regions).
The plant control variables might be endogenously determined and we try to control for
this possibility by lagging them one period. Hence, we assume that growth in
employment between period t and t+1 is caused by, for instance, the size in period t.
Labor productivity, as measured by value-added per employee, was included in some
experiments, but it added nothing to the equation and was dropped.
Ownership is divided into foreign, government-domestic and private-domestic.
Foreign establishments are defined as plants with any foreign ownership. Governmentowned establishments are defined as plants without foreign ownership but with any
government (central or local) ownership. The remaining plants are defined as privatedomestically owned. In some later estimations, ownership is instead a dummy on foreign
acquisitions of domestically owned plants and a dummy on domestic acquisitions of
foreign owned plants. The universe we examine in the estimations on takeovers includes
all firms except those that experience multiple ownership changes. Firm-specific effects
and time dummies are included in the regressions. The ownership dummy variables are
one when an ownership change is recorded and thereafter.
Acquisitions may not be random with respect to factors that determine future
growth.

This means that estimates on employment growth may be biased if non-

randomness is not taken into account. We therefore use propensity score matching (PSM)
combined with the more general difference-in-differences technique, as suggested by e.g.
Blundell and Costa Dias (2005), Heyman et al. (2007), and Arnold and Javorcik (2009).

7

The matching procedure aims to find a group of non-acquired plants that display the same
characteristics as the group of acquired plants. For foreign takeovers, the control group is
taken from the plants that are always domestic, while for domestic takeovers, the control
group is taken from the plants that are always foreign. Matching techniques are used to
construct samples of non-acquired plants that are twins to acquired plants and, thus,
approximate the non-observed counterfactual event: what would have happened to these
plants if they had not been acquired.
The probability of takeover, the propensity score, is obtained by fitting a probit
model. The model specification is similar to the OLS regressions above but adds
variables such as plant age and log productivity, lagged one year. Table A1 shows that
young and large domestically-owned plants with high productivity and energy intensity
are relatively likely to be acquired by foreign owners. By contrast, foreign-owned plants
that are small, with low productivity and energy intensity, are relatively likely to be taken
over by domestic owners. Hence, foreigners acquire what seem to be relatively good
domestic plants (cherry picking) and domestic actors acquire relatively poor foreign
owned plants. By constructing a matched sample based on the probability of takeover, the
selection problem is reduced.
We employ a nearest neighbor matching technique with replacement to construct
our matched sample of plants. In case of foreign takeover, each domestic plant that would
be acquired later by foreign owners is matched to an always domestic plant that has the
closest propensity score. The same approach is used for domestic takeovers. Moreover,
the matched treated and control units are from the same year and same industry.

8

Of the 1,037 foreign takeovers, 390 are in the treatment group. The loss in the
number of foreign takeovers from the treatment group is mainly due to the fact that there
are 475 foreign takeovers reported to have taken place in the second year after the plant
starts operation, and thus there is no employment growth in the pre-acquisition period to
compare with. Another 108 takeovers are dropped because there are some missing values
in the observed characteristics used to estimate propensity scores. Of 652 domestic
takeovers, 291 are included in the treatment group. 233 domestic takeovers are dropped
because they are reported to have taken place in the second year of operation, and another
128 domestic takeovers are dropped because of missing values. It is a cause for concern
that so many takeovers are dropped because they are reported to take place in the second
year of existence. However, the regression analyses were carried out on samples with and
without takeover in the second year, and the results were robust.
Tests are conducted to make sure that our matched sample is balanced in the sense
that the treated and control units have similar pre takeover values on the control variables
(Tables A2 and A3). In the matched sample, the differences in means of the control
variables are not significant between treated and control units.
Having obtained a control group of firms, we combine propensity score matching
with the difference-in-differences estimator to estimate the impact of acquisitions on
employment. The difference-in-differences approach compares employment growth for
the treated group of acquired plants with the relevant control group of plants that are not
acquired.

L is employment growth rates (difference in log employment) or, in some estimations,
employment itself. Post refers to the post-acquisition period, which could be in the year
of acquisition, or one year after, or the average of the whole post-acquisition periods. Pre
refers to the period before acquisition. Similarly it could be one year before the
acquisition, or the average of the all the years before acquisition. The difference in the
second parenthesis corrects the selection bias in the pre-acquisition period.

4. Econometric results
5.1. Determinants of the rate of plant employment growth
We start in Table 3 with simple OLS analyses on the whole universe of
manufacturing plants. The equations include the ownership variables, Foreign and
Government, and the reference group is therefore domestic-private firms. The coefficient
for Foreign is positive and statistically significant, indicating a rate of growth in
employment 6 percent higher in foreign-owned than in domestic-private plants. The
coefficient for government is statistically significant, but only 2 percent.
The equation includes plant characteristics that might affect employment growth.
Large firms have comparatively low growth rates, as has been found in previous studies
(e.g. Karlsson et al., 2008). Plants that are more energy intensive and use more raw
materials are associated with higher employment growth rates in general.
The last two columns examine growth of the numbers of blue- and white- collar
workers. The positive effect on the employment of blue-collar workers is substantially

10

larger than the effect on white-collar workers: 6 percent compared to 3.6 percent. The
effect of government ownership is also higher for blue- than for white- collar workers but
both effects are small compared to the effect of foreign ownership. Finally, the negative
effect of size and the positive effect of input per employee on employment growth
primarily affect blue-collar workers, as is also the case for the positive effect from energy
intensity.
The evidence of Table 3 is that foreign-owned plants tend to increase their
employment 6 percent faster than private domestically-owned plants over the years of
their existence, given the other characteristics of the plants.

5.2. Foreign takeovers and employment growth
In Table 4, we separate the effects of foreign takeovers from those of foreign
ownership in general. The OLS estimate of the effect of foreign ownership aside from
foreign acquisition effects is about 5 per cent per year faster growth in employment. The
effect of foreign acquisition is subsequent growth in employment at a rate 9 per cent
faster than in domestic plants.
The fixed effect approach looks at growth in employment within a firm before
and after the acquisition and removes the time-constant unobserved plant characteristics
that could confound the explanation of acquisition effects. Only firms that change
ownership are included. Fixed effect estimates raise the foreign acquisition effect to 11
percent. The effect on blue-collar workers is about twice as large as the effect on whitecollar workers. Moreover, the results indicate that domestic acquisition reduces the

11

subsequent rate of employment growth, although only the effect on white-collar workers
is statistically significant.
The effect of FDI on employment might differ between trade regimes
(Balasubramanyam et al., 1996). FDI flows drawn to a developing country to take
advantage of cheaper labor costs would respond to an export-oriented policy by
expansion. By contrast, FDI induced by import substitution policy is limited by the size
and income level of the host-country market.
To test for the possible impact of differences in trade regimes, suggested above,
we divide Indonesia’s history since 1975 into three periods, which we think of as an
import substitution period 1975-1985; a trade liberalization period 1986-1996; and the
crisis and post-crisis period 1997-2005.2 The results, shown in Table 5, support the idea
that the effects of FDI on host countries are affected by trade regimes. During the trade
liberalization period 1986-1996, the employment growth rate effect of foreign acquisition
was as high as 19 percent.3 In contrast, foreign takeovers had no significant effects on
employment growth rates during the earlier, import substitution, period 1975-1985.

5.3. Matched comparisons of domestic and foreign takeovers
We test these results for possible biases from the selectivity of acquisitions by
using propensity score matching. The results are shown in Table 6. Foreign takeovers
raise the growth rate of employment by 10 percent on average during the acquisition and
post-acquisition period, after correcting for the pre-acquisition differences between

2

See Aswicahyono et al. (1996; 2008), and Aswicahyono and Hill (2002) for discussions on Indonesia’s
policy regimes, and for similar distinctions in different periods.

acquired and non-acquired plants. This is similar to the fixed effect estimate. Domestic
takeovers, according to the matched comparison, do not affect employment growth rates.
While the employment growth rates in foreign takeovers do not differ
significantly from those of plants remaining domestically-owned in the first and second
years after the takeover, the impact of the foreign takeovers continues, because the
acquired plants grow so much in the year of takeover that the same growth rate after
takeover implies a considerably larger absolute growth in employment in the following
years in the acquired plants, relative to domestic plants, as is shown in Table 7. There are
no similar effects in absolute terms from domestic acquisitions of foreign plants. The
concentration of employment growth rate change in the year of acquisition and the
consequent carryover of absolute employment growth into the following years are vividly
illustrated by Figures 3 and 4.
One implication of this concentration in the year of acquisition is that the usual
assumption that “Greenfield” investment adds resources to the recipient country, but
acquisitions only change ownership is wrong. Acquisitions can be associated with very
substantial additions to resources, quite apart from any gains that might arise from
transfers from less-skilled to more-skilled management.

5. Conclusions
Foreign owned Indonesian manufacturing plants grew more rapidly in
employment than plants that remained in Indonesian ownership during 1975-2005, given
the other characteristics of the plants. The more rapid growth is confirmed by several
tests of the data including a close examination of takeovers of locally-owned plants by

13

foreigners and of foreign-owned plants by local owners. Employment in plants that were
foreign-owned throughout our period grew, on average, about 5 percent faster than in
plants that were always domestically owned. Plants that were acquired by foreigners
grew about 10 percent faster according to fixed effect estimates. Considering that foreign
plants are on average considerably larger than domestic plants, the difference in the
number of jobs created was large.
The propensity score matching consistently confirmed the advantages of foreign
ownership for employment growth. There is also some indication that the employment
growth effects of foreign ownership are sensitive to host country trade policy, with
liberalization encouraging the expansion of employment through foreign takeover.
There were indications in several tests that there was a decline of employment growth in
shifts from foreign to domestic ownership, although that result is not statistically
significant.
Most of the employment effects of foreign takeovers took place in the year of
takeover. There was relatively little effect on growth rates in the following years, but the
absolute additions to employment in the years after takeover were larger than they would
have been under continued local ownership because the base was much larger.
The negative or insignificant effect of domestic acquisition on foreign-owned
plants, as in the fixed effects estimate and the difference-in-differences estimate from a
matched sample, shows that the advantages of foreign-owned plants that accounted for
more rapid growth required continued foreign ownership. They are apparently lost if the
plant returns to domestic ownership.

14

One possible implication of the concentration of growth in the year of acquisition
is that the distinction between “Greenfield investments” and acquisitions is not as sharp
as is often assumed. Many of the acquisitions apparently involve major changes in the
size and possibly other dimensions of the target firms.

Note:
1. For foreign takeovers, the average number of years after acquisition for both treated
and control group is approximately 6 years. For domestic takeovers, both treated and
control groups have on average 6 years after acquisition.
2. The pre-acquisition for this calculation uses information at one year before
acquisition. It would not change the story if the average from all the years before
acquisition is used instead.
3. Standard errors are bootstrapped.
