Much has been made of changes in the wage distribution in the 1980s, but little attention has been given to job durations since Hall (1982). We fill this void by examining the temporal evolution of job retention rates in U.S. labor markets, using data assembled from the sequence of Current Population Survey job tenure supplements.  In contrast to the distribution of wages, which clearly changed in the 1980s, we find that job retention rates have remained stable.\n\n",
