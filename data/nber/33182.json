    "abstract": "\n\nPrevious work using mostly self-reports shows large, positive effects of early-life exposure to Food Stamps on self-sufficiency, health, and well-being-lasting well into adulthood. We combine this same adoption timing with administrative data on earnings, employment, and use of disability benefits. Women born in counties with Food Stamps available in early life had 3 percent higher earnings at age 32. Effects were larger in counties with another in-kind food program in place before Food Stamps. Food Stamps relied on the other program's preexisting administrative eligibility determination.  Our results establish links between pre-existing administrative infrastructure and the later-life impacts of Food Stamps.\n\n",
