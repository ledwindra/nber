ABSTRACT
If experimental subjects arbitrage against market interest rates when making intertemporal
allocations of cash, the data will reveal nothing about subjects' discount rates, only uncovering
subjects' market interest rates. If they frame choices narrowly, market rates will not be salient and
the experiment will uncover subjects' utility discount rates. We test arbitrage directly by forcing
all transactions with subjects to be instant electronic bank transfers, thus making arbitrage easy
and salient. We also employ four decision frames to test alternative hypotheses. Our evidence
contradicts arbitrage, supports money as a valid reward, and suggests framing as a correlate with
present bias.

Introduction

It has long been recognized that if experimental subjects can and do engage in intertemporal arbitrage, then utility maximization will be represented as maximizing present value
of income.

Individual discount parameters play no part in this, thus arbitrage will frus-

trate attempts to use cash rewards to measure subjects' discount parameters (Fisher 1930,
Loewenstein 1987, Cubitt & Read 2007).
While prior literature had been characterized by both signicant present bias (β of about

0.7

in models of quasi-hyperbolic discounting, as in Laibson, 1997) and extreme annual dis-

count rates (80% to 100% annually, Frederick et al. (2002)), new experimental measures
by Andersen, Harrison, Lau & Rutstrom (2008) and Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) nd little present bias in many samples, and discounting near market interest rates.

1

Moreover,

when present bias is detected, it is often in samples for which subjects face binding credit
constraints, as in developing countries or among children.

2

Although arbitrage was addressed early in this literature, (Coller & Williams 1999, Harrison et al. 2002, 2004), important recent ndings have sparked renewed interest in arbitrage
(Cohen et al. 2016, DellaVigna 2018).

3

In particular, Augenblick, Niederle & Sprenger (2015)

showed that when Andreoni & Sprenger's Convex Time Budget (CTB) protocol is used to allocate cash there is little present bias, yet when the same subjects allocate eort, present bias
is signicant. Since allocating eort is thought to be more dicult to arbitrage, fears arose
that arbitrage over money rewards was stripping present bias from the data and invalidating
cash for measuring discounting.
There are several counterpoints to this argument. First, Augenblick et al. (2015) measured both the
present bias,

δ

of quasi-hyperbolic discounting (Strotz 1955, Laibson 1997).

0.89 for eort and 0.98 for cash, indirectly supporting arbitrage for cash but

not work. On the other hand, the estimated discount factor

and

β = 1.

2 See, for example, Kuroishi & Sawada (2018), Sawada & Kuroishi (2015), Janssens et al. (2017), Clot

et al. (2017) and Lührmann et al. (2018). Sawada & Kuroishi (2015) nds that variables correlated with
liquidity have no signicant eect on present bias.

3 Arbitrage refers to borrowing at the lower rate, and saving the higher rate when lab and market rates

dier.

1

rate of about 5% for eort, a reasonable market rate, but 87% for money, an unreasonably
high market rate.
Second, if subjects arbitrage in these studies, should we be surprised that they fail to
arbitrage in other similar circumstances (Harrison et al. 2004)? Yet, a large literature on
choice bracketing shows that in many situations individuals

narrowly bracket their decisions,

making choices in isolation rather than broadly considering the consequences of their choices
for later decisions (Read et al. 1999, Rabin & Weizsacker 2009). Early experiments uncovering biases in discounting (Thaler 1981, Loewenstein & Thaler 1989), certain types of mental
accounting (Thaler 1985), and the endowment eect over goods easily repurchased outside
the lab (Kahneman et al. 1990), are failures of arbitrage attributed to narrow bracketing.
Third, Balakrishnan et al. (2017) applied CTBs to a sample in Kenya, conducting all
payments electronically so that the today payment could be applied immediately. They
found a

β

parameter similar to that in the eort allocation in Augenblick et al. (2015), while

when the payment was made after a four hour delay

β

returned to 1, as in Andreoni &

Sprenger (2012), suggesting that four hours could be enough delay to avoid present bias.

4

Fourth, economic lab experiments testing equilibria in nancial markets where arbitrage
is given its best chance have instead found signicant deviations of assets prices from fundamentals (Lei et al. 2001), contradicting (within-lab) arbitrage. Researchers in the eld also
nd little evidence that individuals smooth consumption over small gains (for a summary,
see

Halevy, 2014).
Fifth, both psychologists and economists have found that individual discounting can

vary across commodities (Chapman 1996, Tsukayama & Duckworth 2010, Reuben et al.
2010, Ubfal 2016).

This is unsurprising if we think of present-bias as self-control; not all

items are equally tempting. Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin (2006), for instance, nd that although
discounting parameters estimated using rice, ice cream, and money were correlated, only the
estimates from money predict take-up of nancial commitment. Others also nd discounting
estimated from money correlates with other intertemporal tradeos (Chabris et al. 2008,
Meier & Sprenger 2010, 2015) including those using CTB elicitations (Sawada & Kuroishi

4 This contrasts with the fMRI study of McClure et al. (2007) that found immediacy aects for gift
cards delivered one hour after the decision, and which produced primary rewards no sooner than a day later,
but may speak to their conjectures on the importance on framing with monetary rewards (p.5803).

2

2015, Andreoni et al. 2016, Aycinena et al. 2018, to name a few).
Sixth, a variety of physiological evidence corroborates the idea that the receipt of a cash
reward presents the same as a primary reward. CTB results using cash correlate with pupil
dilation (Lempert et al. 2015, 2016) and with 2D-4D digit ratios, an indicator of pre-natal
testosterone exposure (Aycinena & Rentschler 2017). Löckenho, O'Donoghue & Dunning
(2011) found that discounting and present bias are signicantly correlated with psychological
measures of anticipated emotional arousal at receiving monetary payments over time.
Finally, fMRI studies of temporal discounting (McClure et al. 2004, 2007, Kable & Glimcher 2007) using monetary incentives have not been hamstrung by arbitrage, and instead
identify signicant present bias. Also, in a pivotal study, Levy and Glimcher (2011, p. 14693)
note an obvious truth from both the economics and psychology of exchange: The ability
of human subjects to choose between disparate kinds of rewards suggests that the neural
circuits for valuing dierent reward types must converge. Their research looked at choices
involving money, food, and water, and found support for the hypothesis that, Partially distinct valuation networks for dierent reward types converge on a unied valuation network,
which enables a direct comparison between dierent reward types and hence guides valuation and choice. That is, the brain has a mechanism by which money achieves value by its
potential to be exchanged for a primary reward, in something of a neural re-imagining of the

5

Kiyotaki-Wright (1993) model.

In a meta-study of 87 publications, Sescousse et al. (2013)

nd substantial overlap in brain areas involved in primary and monetary rewards. In a large
meta-analysis, Bartra, McGuire & Kable (2013) (see also Levy & Glimcher, 2012) conclude
that the evidence aligns with an emerging consensus of a unitary system (p. 424) of neural
value of primary and monetary rewards.
We report on a CTB laboratory study using the protocol of Andreoni et al. (2015), but
adjusted to make arbitrage as easy as possible.

We experimentally manipulate subject's

initial liquidity and whether subjects allocate receipts or payments between sooner or later
dates, while equalizing the potential future value of earnings. We nd only a modest fraction
of subjects are arbitrageurs, and that money receipts and payments have distinct signatures

5 See also Knutson et al. (2001), Ballard & Knutson (2009), Chib et al. (2009), and McNamee et al. (2013).
See Yoo & Hayden (2018) for a dierent interpretation.

of value as commodities. Moreover, we nd no signicant present bias in the receipt frame
most closely resembling Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) but nd signicant present bias in the
payment frame that is reective of the eort allocation in Augenblick et al. (2015).

This

framing eect is, like many framing eects, dicult for typical economic models to address.
This makes the nding both worth replication and further investigation. The explanation
may lie in understanding more precisely how brains assign values to options, and the role
positive and negative frames may play in this.

6

These results, in combination with those from neuroscience, should soothe worries that
money is not a reliable reward when studying intertemporal choice.

Moreover, they raise

many constructive new hypotheses for how both money and commodities generate value
in experimental environments, and how evidence on discounting could be used to improve
models of intertemporal choice.

2

Arbitrage versus Narrow Bracketing

To prefer arbitrage, subjects must be forward looking; they broadly bracket their allocations
of money to maximize the present value of their incomes. To perform arbitrage, subjects must
have access to capital markets and sucient liquidity to oset any experimental payments.
To expect subjects to reveal discount parameters using money rewards would require
decision makers to narrowly bracket choices as they would with a desirable primary reward
(Read et al. 1999, Rabin & Weizsacker 2009). It is important to note that making decisions
that are not fully forward looking is not the same as consuming the allocations immediately,
only that they consume a ow of utility immediately.

Narrow bracketing is applied fre-

quently in behavioral economics as a foundation for loss aversion, endowment eects, mental
accounting, present-bias, and more.
Alternatively, one could take the observation of dierent discount parameters for eort
and money at face value; perhaps the parameters are measured accurately for both money
and eort, but individuals simply have dierent discount factors for each. Importantly, such

6 In this vein, the work of Fisher & Rangel (2014) comes to mind. If a negative frame causes attention
to be xated on certain choices longer, this could result in the frame aecting values and, in turn, revealed
discounting rates.

4

good-specic discounting can easily lead to time-inconsistent preferences.
To see this, imagine utility

U (x, y) = u(x0 ) + v(y0 ) + δx u(x1 ) + δy v(y1 )
with good-specic discounting

0 < δy < δx < 1.

Let

β = δy /δx < 1,

and rewrite utility as

U (x, y) = u(x0 ) + v(y0 ) + δx u(x1 ) + βδx v(y1 ),
which naturally shows present bias for the good one is relatively more impatient for. We
need only appeal to Jackson & Yariv (2014) to demonstrate that good-specic discount rates

must

result in time-inconsistent preferences.

Additionally, we show in Appendix Section A.1 that for commodity choices to present
accurate measures of discounting requires the additional assumption that the commodity in
use has no complements or substitutes with other items in the budget.
As has been the way of economics, hewing as closely as possible to Samuelson's (1937)
statement of time-separable discounted utility, allowing commodity specic discount rates
would appear to create an implausible degree of separability across commodities, and a
tangled web of shifting time inconsistent preferences. So, while the suggestion of commodityspecic discounting has some appeal, it is perhaps a quick x to a larger and more challenging
issue.

Experimental Design

Sprenger (2015), Cohen et al. (2016) and DellaVigna (2018) provide recent overviews of
the diculties and advances in measuring discount rates. In light of the focus on arbitrage
precipitated by the study of Augenblick et al. (2015) comparing time and eort allocations in
the Andreoni & Sprenger (2012) Convex Time Budget framework, we used the CTB design
as modied by Andreoni et al. (2015).
Subjects were shown a series of intertemporal budgets. For each budget, they chose from
a set of eight options to allocate money over time at a xed interest rate.

5

Subjects rst

encountered eight budgets, each budget oering eight allocations between the day of the
study and four weeks in the future. Next were eight budgets oering allocations between
four weeks and eight weeks in the future.
Within each eight-budget decision sheet, subjects started by allocating $21 at a 0% rate.
The rate increased as subjects worked through the budgets.

The rates diered slightly

between the rst (0-4 week) and second (4-8 week) allocations so that subjects weren't
strongly primed by their rst decisions. Interest rates ranged from 0% to 28.5%. Participants
did not encounter the interest rates directly, but instead saw eight evenly-spaced options of
allocations at the earlier date and the later date. The maximum sooner allocation was always
the left-most option and the maximum later allocation was always the right-most option.
The maximum later receipt/payment was always $21. We present details on each budget in
Appendix Table A1. The subjects' instructions and decision sheets are in Appendix Section
B.

3.1 Experimental Conditions
Our

2×2

treatment randomization occurred between-subjects.

In addition to allocating

either receipts or payments across sooner and later dates, all subjects also got an initial
payment on the date of the study and nal payments on the day following their last chosen
transaction. Initial payments, which could be negative, manipulated whether subjects initial
liquidity is eased during the course of the study, or tightened.

Final payments equalized

maximum potential future value of earnings at $23. All subjects got early and later payments
to keep the total number of payments constant across subjects.
Credit-Receive (CR) subjects participated in a standard implementation of the CTB
choosing an allocations of electronic transfers into their bank accounts that could be as high
as $21, along with $1 initial and nal transfers (to equalize the number of transactions across
conditions).

Credit-Pay (CP) subjects received an initial transfer of $22 that could cover

any of the subsequent repayment plans they could chose to implement. They received a nal
transfer of $22. Debit-Receive (DR) subjects had to make an initial payment of $22 to the
EconLab before choosing a schedule for the EconLab to pay them back, thus had to remove
$22 from their personal funds. They received a nal transfer of $24. Lastly, Debit-Pay (DP)

6

subjects received an initial payment of $1 from the EconLab (again, to equalize the number
of transactions) before choosing from a schedule of payments to the EconLab, which could
be as high as $21. They received a nal transfer of $43. Appendix Table A2 shows the design
of each cell in our study and the associated transfers.

3.2 Procedures
Our sample consists of 128 UC San Diego undergraduate volunteers, spread among 10 experimental sessions. We recruited only students with accounts at Chase Bank who would
be willing to use Chase QuickPay for experimental transactions. Chase maintains a branch
UC San Diego student center, and Quickpay is a free service for Chase clients who also have
savings and checking accounts and a debit card. Prior to indicating their informed consent,
and regardless of subsequent treatment randomization, participants were told that there was
a possibility they would have use their own funds in the short run, although they were guaranteed earnings commensurate with their time and eort in the long run.

After consent,

everyone in the session was randomized into the same treatment. Following the session, one
budget was randomly selected as the budget-that-counts for payments. This was common
to the session.
Chase QuickPay oered a variety of advantages for this study. First, participants were
informed that while there would be a stream of payments between them and the EconLab
over the following eight weeks, they would not have to come back to the lab at any point.
Second, QuickPay allowed scheduling of future payments. Following the participants' choices,
but during the same session, we scheduled and veried all payments electronically, and any
payments due on the date of the study were completed before subjects left the lab. Third,
all subjects were required to schedule the same number of transfers, regardless of their
decisions. We enforce this by making $0.01 transfers on the dates where subjects allocate
zero dollars. No payments were made in cash. Fourth, choosing subjects with accounts at
a nancial institution with a physical presence on campus was the most natural way gain
subjects' condence in the transfers, and thus facilitate arbitrage.

In a post-experiment

questionnaire, 127 of 128 participants conrmed this condence.
Three participants did not complete their transactions as scheduled and were removed

7

from the sample. Seven did not respond to all 16 questions in their primary choice set and
were also omitted, leaving 118 subjects in our estimation sample.

Results

To compare choices across Pay and Receive conditions, and across budgets within each
condition, we create a variable equal to the fraction of potential or residual income that
is allocated to the sooner period.

We call this variable

Adjusted Sooner Income,

ASI .

or

For example, if a subject in a Receive condition chooses $7 today and $14 in four weeks,
from a budget that oered a maximum of $21 today, her

ASI

is

7/21 = 0.33.

If a subject

in a Pay condition chooses $14 today and $7 in four weeks, from a budget that allowed a
maximum payment of $21 today, her

ASI

is also

0.33,

because the unpaid balance today is

$7. If the four-week interest rate increases to 5%, the maximum sooner receipt or payment
decreases to $20. Choosing to receive $7 or pay $13 today would thus correspond to an
of

ASI

7/20 = 0.35.
A comparison of average choices across budgets is presented in Figure 1. For each choice

we plot the budget line that subjects faced and the average choice from it, by condition.
Several observations are apparent in this gure: 1) Choices vary by Receive/Pay framing.
2) Average choices are not near corner solutions except for at high interest rates.

While

the average interior choice masks many individual corner choices, it is notably inconsistent
with a unique market interest rate that our relatively homogeneous sample can access. 3)
When the interest rate is 0%, or close to 0%, subjects do not fully front-load income. This is
especially true in the Pay condition, and is inconsistent with both the arbitrage hypothesis
and a model in which the marginal utility of income is non-decreasing.

4.1 Treatment Eects on ASI
Arbitraging subjects should not be aected by Receive-Pay variation in framing. We test
for dierences across conditions in two ways. First, we ask whether the distribution of

ASI

7 In addition to the results reported here, our data collection also consisted of a second set of choices for
each subject that switched the subjects' pay/receive condition to the opposite. Since we found strong order
eects (which are also inconsistent with arbitrage, and in interesting and complex ways) we opted, due to
constraints on words, to set this data aside for later analysis.

Additionally, we consider whether the likelihood of censoring at

at the session level, clustering standard errors at the session level is appropriate here. With
only ten sessions, however, this clustering can be unreliable (Donald & Lang 2007).

We

therefore adopt the wild-bootstrap cluster suggested by Cameron et al. (2008) for the OLS
models. For the Tobit model, we use the score-bootstrap generalization of the wild bootstrap
from Kline & Santos (2012).

4.2 Corner Solutions
The strictest test for arbitrage is that subjects should behave as if they have linear indierence
curves with a slope determined by the market interest rate.

That is, we should observe

exclusively corner solutions. While 70% of observed choices are at corners, this is signicantly
dierent from 100%.

12

At the subject level, 28% of participants make zero interior choices,

which again deviates signicantly from full arbitrage.

What if we limit ourselves to the lowest and highest interest rates oered, where corners
are most clearly optimal for arbitrageurs? All of our subjects are known to have interestbearing savings accounts, so at

Inconsistent with arbitrage, there is evidence of signicant present bias in our data.

While the eect is evident in our pooled data, the magnitude of present bias is the largest
and most signicant for the Credit-Pay condition, and the nearest to zero present bias in the
Credit-Receive condition.

Arbitrageurs?

While we reject arbitrage in general, it is important to ask whether individual subjects make
choices consistent with arbitrage.

These subjects have at most one switch point, moving

from all-sooner to all-later income as the interest rate rises. They have at most one interior
choice, and it will lie on the budget separating the two sets of corner choices.
Across all treatments, 33% of subjects meet this denition of an arbitrageur. However,
there is considerable heterogeneity across treatments. Credit-Receivethe standard implementation of CTBsgarners the most arbitrageurs (46%). Next is Debit-Receive (32%), followed Credit-Pay (31%) and nally Debit-Pay (24%). Notice that Credit-Receive is framed
like a standard CTB and has nearly twice as many arbitrageurs as the Debit-Pay treatment,
which has a negative frame in common with eort supply.
The strong treatment eect on arbitrageurs is further evidence against arbitrage in general, and raises questions of whether arbitrage is even an objective of those we have just
labeled arbitrageurs. It indicates that no more than a quarter of all people would be arbitrageurs regardless of the frame.

Conclusion

There is a rich and evolving literature on estimating structural preference parameters for
temporal discounting. Researchers have long relied on monetary rewards for these estimates.

21 For example, Kuhn et al. (2017) nd that behaivor consistent with arbitrage responds to hunger and
satiation.

17

From the beginning, however, researchers have noted the concern that arbitrage of cash
rewards removes from the data of any signs of hyperbolic discounting that exists over primary
rewards. Since arbitrage requires broad bracketing of decisions and present bias is rooted in
narrow bracketing, this argument suggests an interesting model in which subjects integrate
monetary rewards into long run nancial plans, yet when faced with opportunities to spend
that money submit to narrow bracketing and display present bias.
To explore the hypothesis that money may not be a reliable reward when studying intertemporal choice, we constructed a direct laboratory test of arbitrage. To give arbitrage
its best chance, we recruited subjects with sucient liquidity to arbitrage against the experimental payments. Next, all payments between the EconLab and our subjects were made
with instant and direct bank transfers. This mechanically made arbitrage both obvious and
easy. It also made today payments immediate. We used our

2×2

design to either add

to liquidity by crediting their bank accounts (Credit Condition), or force subjects to pay us
up-front and thus restrict their liquidity (Debit condition). Finally, we framed the actions of
the subjects as choosing either when to receive cash payments from us (Receive condition) or
when to pay cash to us (Pay condition). All four cells of the study oered subjects identical
maximum potential future value, and identical transaction costs, and thus arbitrage would
make the same predictions for each cell.
Our direct tests strongly contradict the arbitrage hypothesis.

First, the choice frame

matters. Subjects in the Receive conditions demanded signicantly more sooner income than
those in the Pay frames. Second, not all choices were made at corner solutions as arbitrage
requires, especially at low interest rates.

Finally, we nd no evidence of present bias in

the Credit-Receive condition, the condition corresponding to standard implementations of
the CTB. By contrast, we nd sizable present bias in the Credit-Pay condition, which has
important framing elements in common with the eort-allocation task of Augenblick et al.
(2015).
The Debit conditionswhich were designed to favor arbitrageshowed no dierential
eects from the Credit conditions.
Neuroeconomists have argued that, much like how monetary theory accounts for money,
for the brain to make choices across disparate baskets of goods, it must have a meansa

18

currencyfor comparing values.

Levy & Glimcher (2012) measured subjects' rates of ex-

change between money and various food items outside of the fMRI scanner, then used this
exchange rate to predict the neural exchange rate while in the scanner.

They concluded

that, Both reward types did predict the exchange rate between money and food across our
subject pool, supporting the notion of direct value for economic (and neural) currency.

22

A

major meta-analysis by Bartra et al. (2013), nds a dierent route to the same conclusion.
They state, A principal insight from research on classical conditioning is that a conditioned
stimulus can come to inuence behavior in the same manner as the primary rewards with
which it is associated. Money is presumably an especially well learned secondary incentive.
What does our study say about the within-subject dierences found discounting toward
eort versus money? In light of our ndings rejecting arbitrage and the neurological evidence
that money payments are likely part of a unitary reward system, it would seem that rejecting
either one of the measurements on the basis of the reward media could not be supported.
Instead we perhaps need to ask what it would imply for economic theory to accept both
measurements as reecting something true about preferences. To do so would be to integrate dierent levels of impatience for dierent commodities into a single utility framework,
and perhaps even (as suggested by our ndings) dierent levels of impatience for the same
commodity depending on how the choice is framed.

Until this is accomplished, however,

an obvious implication of the work presented here is that using discount parameters from
one good to predict choices on another could be misleading. Best practices would appear to
indicate that if the researcher is interested in policies for eort, then discounting should be
measured with eort. When the application is to money, the best media to use to design
policies regarding personal nance is most likely money.
Given the ubiquity of Samuelson's (1937) model, the well learned reex for assuming time
separability and constant discounting may have led economists to force the interpretation
of most data to t this approach. Is it only the structure given by Samuelson (1937) that
makes us surprised to see dierent commodities ruled by dierent discount rates?
estingly, Samuelson (1937) himself warned of this.

Inter-

He says (page 139) that the model of

discounted utility has serious limitations...which almost certainly vitiate it even from a the-

22 See also important contributions by Chib et al. (2009) and McNamee et al. (2013).

19

oretical point of view. The questionable assumption he points to rst and most strongly is
time-separable preferences. Abstracting away from time-separability and constant discounting, we can alternatively interpret the data as saying the marginal rates of intertemporal
substitution within a good over time, or between goods over time, can be dierent. Moreover, they may depend on past, current, or perhaps future levels of consumption, accounting
for endogenous tastes.

The question for research will then be can we fashion a tractable

and exible theory that will allow us to analyze intertemporal choice from a productive and
realistic perspective.

Given our ever-sharper tools of experimental economics, we may be

able to go beyond Samuelson's self-described arbitrary assumptions and, as he suggested,
let observable facts shape a more full model of preferences.

Appendix for Online Publication

This appendix is to accompany Arbitrage Or Narrow Bracketing?
On Using Money to Measure Intertemporal Preferences by J.Andreoni, C. Gravert, M.Kuhn,
S. Saccardo,& Y. Yang.

A.1 On Measuring Discounting with Consumption
As stated in the text, it is also necessary that there be no other items in a subject's current
or future consumption that is a complement or substitute for the consumption being used
as a reward in the lab. This point is most easily conveyed with a number of examples.

Example 1.
that

Substitutes.

` = 1 − e.

A subject spends eort

e

each period and enjoys leisure,

`

such

For simplicity assume no discounting and no interest. She lives for three

periods with utility

U = u(1 − e1 ) + u(1 − e2 ) + u(1 − e3 ),

where

u(·) is strictly concave.

ek = 1/3

e1 + e2 + e3 = 1.

She

Given

k.

Suppose she becomes a subject in an experiment and

x1 + x2 = 1.

If the experiment is at the start of day 1 and she has

for all

yet to consume any work or leisure, she will again allocate her total eort (now increased by
1 unit) equally across the three periods:
of solutions for

x1

and

x2 ,

e1 + x1 = e2 + x2 = e3 = 2/3.

and since we do not observe

ek

for any

k,

This has a continuum

we learn nothing about

preferences from this exercise.
Here the substitutablity between eort in the experiment or outside the experiment leads
to a fully uninformative experiment.

Example 2.

Future Flexibility.

Continue with the prior example, but now suppose the

experiment comes in the middle of the day and the subject has already spent
working. Now to smooth her work equally she must choose

e3 = 2/3.

e1 = 1/3 units

x1 = 1/3, x2 = 2/3, e2 = 0

and

Since any subject will be more constrained today when the task was unanticipated

than in the future when the eort is anticipated, we naturally expect more cases of eort
being higher later.

If we neglect this, then observing only

x1

and

x2

would incorrectly

lead us to conclude the subject is present-biased when in fact she is choosing leisure in the

27

experiment to smooth her consumption. This example mirrors the conclusions of Carvalho
et al. (2016).
This example shows problems with eort provision when it interacts with on some ow
of consumption already experienced today, and the relatively greater exibility one has later
to absorb the anticipated demands for eort (or supply of food rewards) in the future than
in the current period.

Example 3

Complements.

Suppose a subject consumes goods

fully perishable. The subject's utility is

This perfectly reveals the

δ.

Example 3 shows how money can be a superior way to elicit preferences if the subject
narrow brackets consumption. The reason is that, other than discounting, money will have a
relatively constant value across periods that will not be changed much by prior spending of
money or recent consumption of other goods. You can notice that if we brought in a capital
market through broadly bracketing the choice, Example 3 would end with the experimenter
nding the switch point
rather than

k = 1 + r,

where

r

is the relevant market rate faced by the subject

k = 1/δ .

Sub jects' Instructions and Decision Sheets

35

Experimental Instructions

Welcome!
Thank you for participating in today’s study.
Today’s study will involve payments between you and the UCSD Econlab that will take
place over the next 8 weeks. All the decisions about timing and amounts of these payments
will be made today, in the EconLab, and you will not need to return to the Econlab, as all
payments will be made electronically. The whole process will take about an hour. By the end
of the 8 weeks, you can expect to have total earning of at least $15 and at most $25.

Eligibility for this study
To participate in this study you will need to understand and agree to several things. Please
read this section very carefully. If you feel that you do not meet all of the criteria below,
please let us know and we will excuse you from the study.
To take part in this study the following must be true for you:
•

You must have an online Chase bank account with a minimum of $22 in your account.

•

You must be enrolled in Chase QuickPay and willing to log in to your online banking
during the study.

•

While you will surely earn money in this study, achieving you final earnings will
sometime involve you making payments to the EconLab as well as you receiving
money from the EconLab.

•

You must be willing to receive your payment from the EconLab and to the EconLab
via Chase QuickPay.

•

You must be willing to provide your name and e-mail address, as required by Chase
QuickPay. This information will only be seen by Professor Andreoni and his
assistants when using QuickPay. After the final payment has been sent, this
information will be destroyed. Your identity will not be part of any subsequent data
analysis. No personal bank data will be collected during the experiment.

•

Once you decide to participate, you must faithfully carry out all payments.

If you do not agree or do not meet all of these criteria please inform us now.
Thank you!

Experimental Instructions

Earning money
In today’s study, you will encounter 4 scenarios and make 8 choices in each scenario, for a
total of 32 choices. Each of the 32 choices will be over how to allocate money between two
points in time. One time is “earlier” and one time is “later”. Both the earlier and later times
may vary across different scenarios. While your final earnings from the experiment will be
between $15 and $25, however the dates that you will receive these earnings will depend on
the scenario. You could have your earnings as early as today before the end of the
experiment, as late as 8 weeks and a day from today, or a date in between. All the payments
will be done via Chase Quick Pay and will be scheduled by you today.
Once all 32 decisions have been made, we will randomly select 1 of the 4 scenarios and
then 1 of the 8 choices from that scenario as the decision-that-counts. All 8 choices in a
scenario will be on one sheet of paper: so one scenario corresponds to one decision sheet.
The randomly selected scenario and choice will determine the exact amount of your actual
earnings. Since all scenarios and choices are equally likely to be chosen, you should make
each choice in each scenario as if it will be the decision-that-counts.
Important: You will be given a total of 4 decision sheets, each with 8 decisions, making 32
decisions in total. At the top of each decision sheet you will be informed about the scenario
for the choices.
At the end of the session today, you will schedule the payments of the decision-that-counts
via Quick Pay, according to the days indicated by the decision-that-counts.
IMPORTANT NOTE: In order for you to receive your earnings from this study, you
must schedule the payments truthfully based on your choice on the decision-that-counts
and the selected scenario. We sincerely appreciate your cooperation.
On your table is a business card of Professor Andreoni with his contact information. Please
keep this in a safe place. If one of your payments is not received you should immediately
contact Professor Andreoni.
Please do not talk out loud during the rest of the study today. If you have any questions,
please raise your hand, and someone will come to speak with you in private.
The decisions you will make are best described by examples, so before we begin the study,
we are going to work through some examples of the choices and scenarios together.
When instructed to do so, please turn the page to begin the examples.
