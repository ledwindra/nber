ABSTRACT
I decompose Virginia’s paper money into expected real-asset present value, risk discount, and
transaction premium or “moneyness” value. The value of Virginia’s paper money was determined
primarily by its real-asset present value. The transaction premium was small. Positive risk
discounts occurred in years when treasurer malfeasance was suspected. Virginia’s paper money
was not a fiat currency, but a barter asset, with just enough “moneyness” value to make it the
preferred medium of exchange for local transactions. Compared with alternative models, my
decomposition model of inside monies is superior conceptually and statistically for explaining the
performance of American colonial paper monies.

Colonial Virginia’s Paper Money Regime, 1755-1774: Value
Decomposition and Performance
(3/13/2016)

Farley Grubb 1

I decompose Virginia’s paper money into expected real-asset present value, risk discount,
and transaction premium or “moneyness” value. The value of Virginia’s paper money
was determined primarily by its real-asset present value. The transaction premium was
small. Positive risk discounts occurred in years when treasurer malfeasance was
suspected. Virginia’s paper money was not a fiat currency, but a barter asset, with just
enough “moneyness” value to make it the preferred medium of exchange for local
transactions. Compared with alternative models, my decomposition model of inside
monies is superior conceptually and statistically for explaining the performance of
American colonial paper monies.
In 1755, Virginia and Georgia became the last of the 13 colonies to emit paper money.
The performance of Virginia’s paper money regime is central to the history of the period; it was
at the center of the conflict with the Crown over colonial monetary powers and provided
Parliament justification for passing the Currency Act of 1764 (4 Geo III c. 34). This conflict
contributed to revolutionary sentiments. Virginia’s paper money regime was also a contentious
point in Virginia politics. Irregular activities by Virginia’s treasurer occupied a substantial
amount of political attention. Virginia’s administrative structure was altered as a result. 2
I model and statistically evaluate Virginia’s paper money regime. Such has not been done
before. I apply my decomposition model for inside monies to Virginia’s paper money to track the
determinants of the paper money’s value over time (Celia and Grubb 2016; Grubb 2014, 2016). I
measure whether and to what extent this paper money functioned as “money” as opposed to just
being a barter asset. I establish the timing and estimate the magnitude of the risk attached to this
money when monetary troubles were suspected. I also construct the quantitative monetary data

needed to execute this approach (Grubb 2015).
Paper money was created by the Virginia legislature and directly spent by that legislature
through its treasury. Legislature-issued, colony-specific paper monies were the only paper
monies in circulation in colonial America. No public or private incorporated banks issuing paper
banknotes backed by fractional specie reserves, with said banknotes redeemable at face value in
specie at the issuing bank, existed in colonial America (Hammond 1991, pp. 3-67).
Prior to emitting paper money, Virginia’s media of exchange consisted of barter,
typically involving book credit transactions and tobacco—often in the form of claims to tobacco
or tobacco notes; personal bills of exchange and promissory notes; and foreign specie coins
(Breen 1985, pp. 94-7; Tillson 2010, pp. 36-8, 64). The composition of this media is unknown,
though specie coins were considered relatively scarce. Virginia referred to its paper money as
treasury notes. Other colonies referred to their paper monies as bills of credit. While treasury
notes were the same as bills of credit, I will refer to Virginia’s paper money as notes rather than
bills in keeping with Virginia’s terminology (Hening 1969, v. 7, p. 353).
The paper proceeds as follows: First, I discuss the institutional structure of Virginia’s
paper money regime, how the mechanics of paper money emissions and redemptions worked,
and report the forensically reconstructed data needed to statistically analyze regime performance.
Second, I present my decomposition model of monetary performance and apply that model to the
data. Third, I statistically evaluate that model using the data. I also compare it with the statistical
outcome of the most prominent, and only other, alternative model of colonial paper money
performance that can be estimated. I conclude with a summary of the findings.
Institutional Structure and Quantitative Measures
Virginia had the second largest free population of the 13 colonies (Carter, et al. 2006, v.

2

5, p. 652). Why Virginia took so long to initiate its own paper money regime is curious.
Budgetary crises caused by wars typically pushed colonies into a paper money system (Grubb
2016). Virginia did not face such a crisis until the Seven Year’s War. The immediate and large
spending demands of Virginia’s participation in that war swamped Virginia’s ability to raise
enough taxes immediately to meet these expenses (Brock 1975, pp. 466-9, 476).
Colonial governments faced standard budget constraints. Tax receipts had to match
spending; when they didn’t, colonial governments had to adjust their borrowing and asset
positions. Colonial governments did not have asset positions, such as stocks of gold and land.
External markets where colonial governments could borrow were not adequately developed or
accessible (Brock 1975, pp. 467-9). Thus, when current tax receipts did not match current
spending, colonial governments had to move tax receipts through time to balance budgets.
Virginia did this by issuing treasury notes as a paper money (M), see equation (1). Paper
money creation was a credit-debt mechanism that matched budget deficits with budget surplus
over a multi-year horizon. The balanced budget requirement was cut loose from a strict time unit,
such as the fiscal year. It still had to be balanced, but now it could be balanced over a multi-year
horizon. Colonial paper money acts included concurrent tax legislation designed to redeem the
notes emitted at their face value in the near future. Redeemed notes would be removed from
circulation and subsequently destroyed.

To maintain fiscal credibility, future taxes in excess of spending, (Tt - Gt) > 0, had to be

3

spread over numerous years, especially when Mj was large. This process allowed a colony to
marshal more resources to throw immediately into battle than what could be done by relying
only on current tax receipts. For example, Virginia’s paper money acts passed during the Seven
Year’s War (1755-62) stated:
And whereas, by reason of the long time allowed for collecting the duties imposed by this
act, (Which, from the distressed circumstances of the people, and the great scarcity of
gold and silver coin in this colony, could not be sooner done) the said duties will not be
collected in time to answer the purposes [funding troops] hereby intended, Be it therefore
enacted, That John Robinson,…treasurer of this colony,… is hereby authorized, and
required to issue and emit so many treasury notes, as will be sufficient for the purposes
aforesaid,…(from the March 1756 act, Hening 1969, v. 7, p. 32, italics in original)
This process imparted a time-discounting dimension to the notes emitted. After 1756, Virginia’s
notes paid no interest. They were, in effect, zero-coupon bonds.
The typical method of tax-redemption was to set net new taxes to redeem Mj to be an
equal amount per year (Ŧ t) over an N-year redemption window, i.e. (Tt - Gt)/N = Ŧt for years j+1
through N. The Virginia legislature took note redemption and its effect on controlling the value
of its paper money seriously. Such is illustrated in the March 1760 paper money act which stated,
And whereas it is of the greatest importance to preserve the credit of the paper
currency of this colony, and nothing can contribute more to that end than a due care to
satisfy the publick that the paper bills of credit, or treasury-notes, are properly sunk,
according to the true intent and meaning of the several acts of assembly passed for
emitting the same; and the establishing a regular method for this purpose may prevent
difficulties and confusion in settling the publick accounts,… Be it therefore enacted, by
the authority aforesaid, That Peyton Randolph, esquire, Robert Carter Nicholas,
Benjamin Waller, Lewis Burwell and George Wythe, gentleman, or any three of them,
be, and they are hereby appointed a committee, to examine at least twice in every year
(and oftener, if thereto desired by the treasurer for the time being) all such bills of credit,
or treasury-notes, redeemable on the first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and
sixty five, as have been or shall be paid into the treasury, in discharge of the duties and
taxes imposed by any former act of assembly; and upon receipt of the said bills or notes,
the said committee shall give to the treasurer for the time being a certificate of the
amount thereof, which shall avail the said treasurer in the settlements of his accounts…:
And the said committee are hereby required and directed, so soon as they have given such
certificate, to cause all such bills or notes to be burnt and destroyed. (Hening 1969, v. 7,
p. 353, italics in the original)

If taxes were paid in M, then using the Ŧt method removed Mj from circulation at a
constant amount over the N-year redemption window. If taxes were paid by other means, such as
in specie coins, then Mj would continue in circulation until year N when it would be redeemed at
face value and removed from circulation using the accumulated non-note tax receipts in the
treasury. The language in the 1756 paper money acts illustrates this redemption structure.
That all such notes, so issued, shall be redeemable on the last day of June one thousand
seven hundred and sixty, and shall then be paid by the treasurer… That the several sums
of money and tobacco to be collected, by virtue of this act,…shall be,…paid to John
Robinson, esquire, treasurer of this colony,… That the money to be raised by the duties
imposed by this act, shall stand, be, and remain as a security for the redemption of the
said treasury notes so to be issued, and the said John Robinson, treasurer,…is hereby
required to apply all such money, as shall come to his hands, by virtue of this act, for, and
toward the redemption of such treasury notes, and to no other use or purpose whatsoever.
(Hening 1969, v. 7, pp. 19, 29, 32).
All of Virginia’s paper money acts had this language. By “money,” colonists typically meant
specie monies, sometimes referred to as real money. The face value of the notes for redemption
purposes was fixed in law to be 1£VA = 200 pounds of tobacco = 1.25£S [£VA = Virginia paper
pounds, £S = pounds sterling] (Hening 1969, v. 6, pp. 468-9, 568-9; v. 7, pp. 9-10, 28-9).
a. Virginia’s Paper Money Acts
Table 1 compiles the paper money acts passed by the Virginia legislature and lists the key
features of each act. Fifteen separate paper money acts that involved net new emissions were
passed, with a cumulative total of 484,963£VA in net new emissions made between 1755 and
1774. Notes issued under different acts could be distinguished by the acts’ emission dates printed
on the notes (Newman 2008, pp. 437-57).
Paper money acts began with statements about why monies were required, and in what
amounts. Thirteen of the 15 acts stated that the money was required to cover military expenses.
Paying for military expenses represented 90 percent of all net new paper monies emitted, and 98

Emissions #1, #2, #3, and #4 paid 5 percent annual interest. This interest was suspended by the act creating
emission #6. Emissions #2, #3, and #4 were swapped for emission #6 notes. The accrued interest outstanding to June
1757 was paid by printing extra emission #6 notes. See Grubb (2015).

While statutory law only authorized 10,000£VA for emission #5, 12,000£VA was actually printed and emitted, see
Grubb (2015). Thus, 12,000£VA is used as the correct amount for emission #5 in all subsequent analyses.

This act was passed with a suspending clause. It was subsequently laid aside (suspended) by the Board of Trade, 4
February 1763 (Brock 1975, pp. 488-9; Hening 1969, v. 7. p. 466; Journal of the Commissioners for Trade and
Plantations from January 1759 to December 1763, 1970, pp. 333-4).

percent of all net new paper monies emitted during the Seven Year’s War. Emissions #5 and #15
were used to compensate citizens who lost their tobacco in public warehouse fires. This
compensation represented 8 percent of all net new paper monies emitted. Lastly, emission #14
was used to pay the expense of negotiating and establishing a boundary with the Cherokee
Nation. It represented 2 percent of all net new paper monies emitted.
Paper money acts then elucidated the particulars of how the money would be spent, and

6

how the money would be raised. Regarding spending, these particulars involved such things as
military recruitment, fortification construction, and how tobacco losses would be assessed.
Regarding how money would be raised, these particulars established the type of taxes, the tax
rates, and the taxing period to be used to raise the money required by the act.
Every paper money act listed a single date after which the act’s notes could be redeemed
at the treasury, see Table 1. Redemption was at face value. In each paper money act, the
redemption date and the end of the taxing period imposed to raise the money required by that act
are a close match. In each act, taxing and redemption are clearly linked. Per act, the amounts of
taxes imposed were expected to generate the sums needed to redeem all the notes emitted.
Every paper money acts stated the penalty for counterfeiting and contained a statement
about legal tender status of the notes emitted. The first five emissions were made a “soft” legal
tender. Citizens could be penalized for not accepting the paper money in trade, but the acts did
not impose a value at which citizens had to accept the notes. Emissions #6 through #13 were
made a “hard” legal tender. Citizens could be penalized not only for not accepting the paper
money in trade, but also for not accepting paper money at its specie-equivalent face value.
With the passage of the 1764 Currency Act, emissions #14 and #15 could not be made a
comprehensive legal tender. The legal tender language in these last two acts made the paper
money emitted a legal tender for payments by the treasurer to discharge all legal demands
brought against Virginia and a legal tender for paper money redemption purposes. However, the
paper money passed current in the colony only between persons willing to so receive such notes
in payment. Grubb (2016) shows why legal tender laws had little effect on note value.
Table 1 also identifies three rule changes that altered prior paper money acts. Emission
#6 included a clause that required all outstanding notes of emissions #2, #3, and #4, along with

7

their accrued interest to that point, to be swapped for emission #6 notes. This swap removed any
future interest payments attached to these prior emissions and altered the redemption dates of
these prior emissions to that of emission #6 notes. On 3 November 1761, the legislature changed
the redemption date for all notes currently in circulation, lengthening the redemption period to 20
October 1769. This rule change, however, was passed with a suspending clause, and the Board of
Trade laid it aside (suspended it) on 4 February 1763 (Hening 1969, v. 7. p. 466; Journal of the
Commissioners for Trade and Plantations from January 1759 to December 1763, 1970, pp. 3334). Finally, the legislature on 4 March 1773 replaced the notes still outstanding from emissions
#14 and #15 with new notes and changed their redemption date to 1 June 1774. This note swap
was intended to thwart counterfeiters.
All three rule changes did two things. Notes currently in circulation from different
emissions with different final redemption dates had different present values. Such differences
made for a cumbersome medium of change. The rule changes made all notes currently in
circulation have the same expected present value by giving them the same final redemption date.
The legislature gave the following reason for these rules changes, “…it will be prejudicial to
have notes of different value circulating at the same time…” (Hening 1969, v. 7, p. 81) All three
rule changes, however, were also an ex post facto altering of the expected present value of the
notes affected, in most cases reducing that present value from what it was under the original act.
The ex post facto reduction of the present value of notes in the 1761 rule change was an
important factor leading to that rule change being suspended by the Board of Trade.
b. Forensic Reconstruction of Virginia’s Paper Money Flows
Evaluating the performance of Virginia’s paper money requires knowing the amount of
notes in public circulation each year and the amount of notes redeemed (removed) from the

8

public each year. Unfortunately, the treasury accounts that have survived, as reported in the
Journals of the House of Burgesses, are irregular and inconsistent in their organization, timing of
reporting, completeness, and in how they use such terms as notes “in circulation” and notes
“issued.” 3 An extensive forensic accounting exercise is required to sort this material out. This
involves paying close attention to internal consistency and coherence across accounts, in the
language used, and with the statutory acts. Some controlled back-projection, interpolation, and
data cloning are also required. Grubb (2015) provides the details of this forensic accounting
reconstruction of the data. The outcome is reported in Table 2.
Column (1) in Table 2 incorporates three adjustments to the amounts authorized by
statutory law. First, one-for-one currency swaps are netted out. Second, amounts never released
from the treasury and subsequently burned without ever being emitted are netted out. Lastly,
notes not emitted when authorized, but held in the treasury and emitted to the public in a later
year, are moved to the year when emitted.
Column (2) in Table 2 incorporates three adjustments. First, notes burned that were not
redeemed from the public or were burned as part of a one-for-one currency swap are netted out.
Second, the timing of when notes were removed from circulation is adjusted such that notes
listed as burned in the early months of a given year are counted as being removed from public
circulation in the immediately prior year. Typically, taxes were collected in the fall. The account
of notes burned from these taxes, however, was not reported until the following spring. Third,
some notes paid into the treasury as taxes sat idle there for a number of years before being
burned. When these notes were actually removed from public circulation is estimated by cloning
the expected tax revenue stated for 1763 into expected tax revenues for other years. When notes

The accumulated non-note revenues to 1766 are assumed to be the sums removed from the treasury by John
Robinson, treasurer over this period, which he loaned to his friends. Robinson died 11 May 1766. His estate was
required to pay these amounts back to the treasury. This happened slowly over the next decade. Of the amounts
Robinson removed from the treasury were 95,828£VA of accumulated taxes held for redemption of notes when said
notes’ circulation time was at an end. In 1766, it was recorded that only 2,218£VA was left in the treasury to pass on
to the new treasurer after Robinson death (to use for note redemption). The closeness of the 95,828£VA figure with
what would have accumulated in the treasury into 1766, namely (98,855£VA – 2,218£VA) = 96,637£VA, provides
support for the data construction used here. See Grubb (2015).

were actually removed from the public is prorated by these expected yearly tax revenues. The

10

numbers in column (3) of Table 2 for year t is the number in column (1) for year t-1, plus the
number in column (1) in year t, minus the number in column (2) in year t.
Finally, column (4) of Table 2 estimates the accumulated amount of non-note tax
revenues, primarily specie coins, in the treasury that was to be used to redeem notes at their final
legislated redemption date. These amounts are needed, along with the amounts in column (2), to
estimate the real-asset present value of notes. In addition, adjustments to these amounts need to
be incorporated. For example, John Robinson, the treasurer, removed the amount that had
accumulated into 1766 by loaning these sums out to friends. This action was considered irregular
and possible malfeasance. It created a scandal and the possibility that notes could not be
redeemed when they came due at the treasury. Suspicions that such was going on affected the
expected real-asset present value of the notes in the years prior to 1766.
When notes became redeemable at the treasury for the tax monies accumulated, they
were not always immediately redeemed. The monies held in the treasury for their redemption
continued to be held for that purpose. These notes continued in circulation and, at this point, took
on a redeemable-upon-demand quality with 100 percent reserve-backing in the treasury. Such
behavior needs to be incorporated into calculating the real-asset present values of the notes.
For example, emission #5 was redeemable at the treasury at the end of 1757, but was not
all redeemed until 1766. The tax monies received in 1757 for its redemption continued to be held
in the treasury for future redemption of emission #5 notes (Grubb 2015). Robert Carter Nicholas,
treasurer after 1766, observed similar behavior. In 1773, he noted, “Most of the Merchants as
well as others, … preferred them [Virginia’s notes] either to Gold or Silver, as being more
convenient for transacting the internal Business of the Country.” William and Mary College
Quarterly Historical Magazine (1912, p. 235). The public continued to use these notes to execute

11

domestic transactions and let the full specie equivalent that backed them sit in the treasury.
Value Decomposition
a. My Decomposition Model for Inside Monies
I apply my decomposition approach to evaluate Virginia’s paper money performance
(Celia and Grubb 2016; Grubb 2014, 2016). The observable market exchange value (MEV) of
this money is decomposed into its component parts, see equation (2). 4 MEV equals its expected
real-asset present value (APV - RD), i.e. its value as just another non-money barter asset, plus its
transaction premium (TP) that measures its pure “moneyness” value, i.e. its extra value as a
transacting medium of exchange. Positive values for TP measure the willingness of the public to
pay a premium above the notes’ expected real-asset present value, because the notes served as a
more convenient transacting medium than the next best barter alternative. The expected realasset present value is further separated into it pure time-discounting component (APV), and its
default risk component (RD). All components in equation (2) are calculated as a percentage of
face value to be in a comparable metric.
(2)

MEVt = (APV - RD)t + TPt
If MEV ≈ APV, with (TP - RD) ≈ 0, then Virginia’s paper money is just a low-risk barter

asset with no value as “money” beyond that of the next best barter alternative. If MEV ≈ (APV RD), with TP ≈ 0, then Virginia’s paper money is just a risky barter asset. If MEV ≈ TP, with
(APV - RD) ≈ 0, then Virginia’s paper money is a pure fiat currency. Colonial paper monies
likely operated somewhere between these extremes. The decomposition in equation (2) is used to
4

This decomposition has some resemblance to the discussions of paper money by Benjamin Franklin in 1729
(Labaree 1959, v. 1, p. 153); by Gouverneur Morris in 1778 (Barlow 2012, pp. 73-76); and by James Madison in
1779 (Hutchinson and Rachal 1962, v. 1, pp. 305-06). As such, it can be considered consistent with how some
prominent colonial Americans thought about their paper money. It also has some resemblance to the theory of
money presented by John Maynard Keynes in the General Theory (1991, pp. 222-44 [chapter 17]) and could be
considered an exercise to operationalize and apply that theory. This decomposition can also be thought of as a
simple hedonic pricing exercise for the bundle of attributes that comprise a physical exchange instrument.

12

disentangle the extent that Virginia’s paper money functioned as a commodity or real-asset
medium of exchange ((APV - RD) / MEV) versus as a fiat currency (TP / MEV).
Legislatures controlled APV and RD. They controlled APV by choosing the redemption
structure, and they influenced RD by how they followed through on that redemption structure.
TP was determined by the public through the structure of the economy in terms of how the
public evaluated and used alternative media of exchange to execute domestic transactions.
Empirical measurement is the difficult part of applying this approach. Theory is easy;
application is hard. While I can measure MEV using data on exchange rates to an outside money,
RD and TP cannot be independently measured. In addition, measuring APV entails constructing
a counterfactual value of the notes, namely their value when not used as money and when no risk
of default is expected. Given that they are being used as money, constructing this counterfactual
and disentangling it from MEV requires attention.
Fortunately, Virginia’s treasury notes were structured as zero-coupon bonds, except for
the 1755-6 emissions that were structured as interest-bearing bonds. 5 The notes had legally
defined end maturity dates when they were paid off at face value in specie equivalents by
Virginia’s government, and they could be redeemed at face value for tax payment obligations
any time after initial emission. Given expected redemption time-paths and end maturity dates,
payoff values, and an appropriate risk-free time-discount rate, the APV of these notes as risk-free
non-money tradable bonds can be calculated independent of their MEV.
Moving the variables that can be independently measured to the left-hand side, and the
variables that cannot be independently measured to the right-hand side, yields equation (3). In
terms of proportions, the ratio APVt/MEVt shows how much of MEVt is accounted for by APVt

Benjamin Franklin (Labaree 1967, v. 11, pp. 13-15), Adam Smith (1937, pp. 310-12), and James Madison
(Hutchinson and Rachal 1962, v. 1, pp. 305-06) described colonial bills of credit as zero-coupon bonds.

13

with the residual share being accounted for by (TP - RD)t. The gap between MEVt and APVt,
measures the magnitude of (TP - RD)t. The possibility that TPt and RDt are both greater than
zero by large magnitudes at the same time is unlikely. An asset with a high default risk would be
unlikely to possess a transaction premium, i.e. be the preferred medium of exchange, relative to
an asset with a low default risk. 6 Thus, when (TP - RD)t > 0, it is primarily due to TPt > 0; and
when (TP - RD)t < 0, it is primarily due to RDt > 0.
(3)

(MEVt - APVt) = (TP - RD)t

b. MEV and APV Data
To apply equation (3), two data sets are required. I must compile the market exchange
value (MEV) of Virginia’s notes between 1755 and 1774, and I must calculate the counterfactual
expected real-asset present value (APV) of Virginia’s notes as non-money low-risk bonds. I use
the observed market exchange rates between Virginia’s notes and bills of exchange paying
pounds sterling in London to construct MEV. These exchange rates are primarily from merchant
account books and are expressed as the face value amount of Virginia notes needed to buy, in
Virginia, a 100 pound sterling bill of exchange drawn on London (McCusker 1978, pp. 205-14).
I adjusted these exchange rates to account for the cost of getting a bill of exchange to
London and getting it liquidated into specie usable in Virginia. I estimated that cost to be 7.09
percent. 7 Thus, the realized par exchange rate of a Virginia note is 116.14£VA = 100£S compared

6

While it is mathematically possible for (TP - RD) to equal 1 percent of face value because TP = 1 percent and RD
= 0 percent, or because TP = 100 percent and RD = 99 percent, the later possibility is absurd in practice.
Behaviorally, TP is likely a negative function of RD. Thus, as RD takes on positive values, TP is quickly driven to
zero. People select a particular thing as money because it has certainty to its forecasted value. See also, Keynes
(1991, pp. 222-44 [chapter 17]). The transaction premium (TP) is not about convenience per se. It is about how
much people are willing to pay for this convenience above the convenience value of the next best alternative
medium of exchange. TP is an opportunity cost measure.
7
This information is derived from the exchange rates quoted before bills of credit were ever issued (McCusker
1978, p. 172). In addition, The Boston Evening Post, 25 October 1773, estimated the cost of shipping specie between
the colonies and London to be 6 percent. It was comprised of 2.5 percent for insurance and brokerage, 2.5 percent
for commissions, and 1 percent for freight (Brock 1992, pp. 74, 124). Adding the opportunity cost of time raises the

14

with the legal par exchange rate of 125£VA = 100£S (Hening 1969, v. 6, pp. 478-83). MEV is
calculated by dividing this adjusted number (116.14) by the observed exchange rates in
McCusker (1978, pp. 211-2). Compared with using the legal par exchange rate, using the
realized par rate as the numerator makes MEV a smaller percentage of face value. MEV
measures the spot-market conversion in Virginia of Virginia paper pounds into a silver
commodity outside money expressed as a percentage of the face value of Virginia paper pounds.
The MEV data are presented in Appendix Table A1. Given uncertainty over the exact transaction
cost underlying the adjustment to the legal par rate, an MEV within in a percentage point of that
report in Appendix Table A1 is certainly possible.
Virginia’s paper money had a bearer-bond quality that required an explicit redemption
exercise to extinguish the principal expressed on the note’s face. Virginia’s citizens are assumed
to act as if they understood their paper money to be interest-bearing bonds in 1755-6, and zerocoupon bonds thereafter, requiring time-discounting to ascertain their present value (their APV),
and to know how to calculate this value. 8 The public is also assumed to know the quantity of
notes in circulation (Mj) and the amounts redeemed (REDt) each year as shown in Table 2, with
REDt including the amount of funds (specie) in the treasury that could be used for redemption at
face value at the end maturity dates of the notes as shown in Tables 1 and 2.
At a given point in time, notes with different redemption dates would have different
APVs. Seemingly identical notes with differing present values (APVs) at the same point in time
makes for a cumbersome medium of exchange. Virginia’s legislature attempted to solve this
problem with redemption rule changes in June 1757, November 1761 (subsequently suspended
by the Board of Trade in 1763), and July 1774. These rule changes made all notes currently
cost to approximately the rate estimated here. The transaction costs paid by the New Jersey government, for moving
specie across the Atlantic from 1760 through 1765, was approximately 7.46 percent (Bush 1982, pp. 10-13, 315-16).
8
E.g. see Labaree (1967, v. 11, pp. 13-15); Ricord (1892, v. 17, p. 159); Smith (1937, pp. 310-12).

15

outstanding on those dates have a new common redemption date and so a common APV.
For the most part, the evidence does not record what notes from which emissions were
redeemed when. Occasionally the notes from particular emissions are identified as being burnt
on a specific date, but more often redemption evidence lumps notes from all emissions currently
outstanding together (Grubb 2015). Given legal tender laws, notes from any emission currently
outstanding could be used to pay any current taxes. For these reasons, I assume that the public
responded only to the expected redemption of the average note currently outstanding. Because
the MEV data from McCusker (1978) measures the current market value of the average note in
circulation, and does not distinguish between the notes of different emissions, APV is calculated
to measure the pure time-discounted present value of the average or representative note currently
outstanding. Thus, MEV and APV are comparable measures.
Equation (4) shows how the expected APV of the average note in circulation is
calculated. The amount of Virginia paper money outstanding in a given year is assumed to be
redeemed by all notes actually redeemed in the immediately following years, including the
potential redemption at the end maturity date using accumulated specie in the treasury, until the
year when that original amount is fully redeemed. These yearly redemption amounts are divided
by the initial amount outstanding from the chosen year to assign a yearly weight to its
contribution in the redemption process. The time discounts between the initial year and the
redemption year are multiplied by the contribution-weights for their respective years. The timediscount-weight values for each year are summed to get the expected present value of a
representative note outstanding for that chosen year. The APV calculation is adjusted for 1755-6
to account for the interest actually paid (Grubb 2015).

APVj = ∑ (REDt/Mj)e-rt

Where r = the risk-free time-discount rate or opportunity cost of capital, Mj = the face value
amount of Virginia paper money outstanding in year j, REDt = the face value amount of Virginia
notes redeemed and retired from circulation each year, including the amount of funds (specie) in
the treasury that could be used for redemption at face value at the end maturity dates of the notes,
with REDN being the amount in the last year N that satisfies:

∑ (REDt/Mj) = 1.

No time-series of market-generated interest (discount) rates for any class of assets
currently exists for colonial America. Therefore, I use the r considered normal by colonial
contemporaries for assets with relatively low default expectations. This rate is used as a proxy
for what in modern analysis is designated as the risk-free rate. In 1748, the Virginia assembly set
the legal interest rate for the colony at 5 percent, where it stayed for the rest of the colonial
period. However, the legislature indicated that the market rate was above this legal rate (Hening
1969, v. 6, pp. 101-04). In 1764, Benjamin Franklin stated that the rate for discounting wellfunded legislature-issued zero-coupon bonds was 5 or 6 percent (Labaree 1967, v. 11, pp. 13-15).
The interest rate mentioned most often for the middle colonies in the second half of the
eighteenth century was 6 percent. 9 Earlier in the century, and perhaps during wars, the rate may
have been slightly higher. Given uncertainty over the exact rate, an r from 5 through 7 percent is
used, with 6 percent being my best guess. The APV using discounts rates of 5, 6, and 7 percent

are reported in Appendix Table A1.
APVj is not mechanically linked to Mj. For any given Mj, APVj can take on any value
between 0 and 100 percent of face value, because the legislature has unrestricted choice over N
and REDt. Given r, APVj is under the control of the legislature through its legal design and
execution of its paper money laws.
c. An Alternative Method: Imputing r*
I employ an alternative method to get at the same issue. If TP = 0, then MEV measures
the current spot market value of these notes as non-money bonds. Given the expected redemption
structure, the interest rate r* that makes MEV = (APV - RD) is calculated, i.e. select r* such that
MEVj = ∑t = jT (REDt/Mj)e-r*t. If in fact TP = 0, then r* represents the first time-series of marketgenerated interest rates for any class of assets in colonial America, see Appendix Table A1.
If r* is within the normal range of risk-free discount rates, then the proposition that the
notes are simply non-money barter assets with no special “moneyness” value or fiat currency
attributes cannot be rejected. If r* is above this range, then nothing changes from the above
conclusion except that now RD > 0, namely the notes are risky non-money bonds. If r* is below
this range, then the proposition that RD ≈ 0 and TP > 0, namely that the bills have some
“moneyness” value, cannot be rejected. The magnitude by which r* is outside the normal range
of interest rates measures the extent that RD > 0 when r* is above that range, and the extent that
TP > 0 when r* is below that range.
The Compositional Analysis of MEV: MEV, APV, and r* through Time
Figure 1 compares the levels of MEV and APV over time, when APV is discounted at 5,
6, and 7 percent. MEV could be within a percentage point of that drawn due to measurement
error in the transacting cost of liquidating sterling bills of exchange drawn on London and

turning them into specie usable in Virginia. While 6 percent is my best-guess discount rate,
uncertainty over that rate means that 5 or 7 percent could also be used. Considering the range of
possible measurement error in MEV and uncertainty over which discount rate to use for APV,
the hypothesis that MEV is primarily and predominantly comprised of APV cannot be rejected
given the data in Figure 1. Little (TP - RD) figures in to MEV. Virginia treasury notes were not a
fiat currency. They were predominantly real barter assets.
Using MEV as drawn and the best-guess 6 percent discount rate, over the entire period
covered by colonial Virginia’s paper money regime APV accounts for 97 percent of MEV,
leaving TP to account for only 3 percent of MEV. Within this overall span, four sub-periods can

19

be identified. MEV ≈ APV from 1755 through 1757, implying that (TP - RD) = 0 during the
initial three years of Virginia’s paper money regime. Being a new endeavor for Virginia, the
notes possessing no TP in these initial years is not surprising.
By comparison, MEV > APV, implying that RD ≈ 0 and TP > 0, in the years 1758-62 and
1766-74. The years 1758-62 and 1766-72 appear to be normal in that no specific financial crises
are identifiable. In these normal years, APV accounts for 93-94 percent of MEV leaving TP to
account for 6-7 percent of MEV. While relatively small, this TP was enough to make Virginia’s
treasury notes the preferred media of exchange for executing domestic transactions. The public
was willing to pay somewhere between 6 and 7 percent over the notes’ expected average realasset present value to possess the notes because the notes had a “moneyness” value over and
above the next best barter alternative. This 6 to 7 percent can be considered a measure of the
transaction cost gains from using notes, compared with using book credit, tobacco claims, or
specie, to execute domestic transactions.
a. The John Robinson Scandal at the Treasury
In the sub-period 1763-5, MEV < APV, implying that TP ≈ 0 and RD > 0. This period is
associated with a financial crisis that preoccupied Virginia politics. 10 John Robinson, treasurer
and speaker of the house from 1738 until his death in early 1766, had been suspected of diverting
funds accumulating in the treasury, funds earmarked for redeeming notes at their end maturity
dates. He loaned these funds, without specific authority to do so, to his friends. In 1766, after his
death, it was discovered that just over 95,000£VA of these funds had been so diverted. 11 Given
the large amount diverted, the suspicions expressed at the time that such was happening seem
10

Brock (1975, pp. 465-527) does not mention the John Robinson scandal. He speculates that the exchange rate
crisis of the early 1760s was due to gyrations in tobacco production and troubles in the bills-of-exchange market.
11
Scholars have typically claimed that these diverted funds were notes put back in circulation. This claim turns out
to be presumption predicated on erroneous logic. There is no evidence that these diverted funds were notes. The
forensic accounting exercise indicates that these diverted funds were predominantly specie, see Grubb (2015).

20

credible (Ernst 1973, pp. 177, 183, 188; Lee 1825, pp. 22-3; Mays 1952, pp. 175, 181). The
evidence in Figure 1 is consistent with the public becoming suspicious of improprieties around
1761, judging by the shrinking TP that starts after 1760. (TP - RD) does not become negative
until 1763, which is consistent with the public definitely responding to something being amiss at
the treasury regarding potential note redemption.
Given that a substantial amount of notes in circulation in the early 1760s had their end
maturity dates between 1765 and 1769, see Table 1, the public had to be concerned in the early
1760s that the accumulating tax funds in the treasury earmarked to redeem these notes would not
be there when so required for redemption. A letter in the Virginia Gazette, 17 October 1766,
remarked that “Many of us, to our great detriment, have had money paid to us whose day of
redemption was elapsed, and which some of our creditors refused to receive from us again,
alleging it was no currency; this money, when carried to the Treasury has frequently been
refused to be redeemed, under the pretense that the Treasury was empty,…” Fear of delayed
redemption led the public to eliminate any TP and then to add a positive RD to the notes by
1763. The data in Figure 1, using the best-guess 6 percent discount rate, indicates that the RD in
1763-6, assuming TP ≈ 0, accounted for an average of 7.5 percent of MEV. In other words, MEV
= APV - RD in these years. The notes in this period functioned like risky barter assets.
Figure 1 illustrates what the APV would have been if there was no diversion of treasury
funds, with those funds remaining in the treasury to execute note redemption as legislated.
Between 1763 and 1765, using the best-guess 6 percent discount rate, APV would have been 11
percentage points higher with no treasurer diversion of redemption funds. I construct a
counterfactual MEV for the years 1763-5 using this alternative higher APV by assuming MEV =
APV + TP, where the TP is taken from the prior normal years of 1758-62, and RD is assumed to

21

be zero. In the absence of treasurer malfeasance, MEV would have averaged 96 percent of face
value in 1763-5 as opposed to its actual 72 percent of face value—a 24 percentage point effect
on MEV. The exchange rate crisis of the early 1760s can be fully accounted for by the treasurer’s
diversion of redemption funds (Ernst 1973, p. 194).
After Robinson died in early 1766 and his actions were fully documented, MEV and
APV rapidly returned to normal patterns. Robinson’s estate was required to repay the sums
diverted. The slow repayment of these funds, and the resumption of normal tax payments and use
of the specie portion to redeem notes, meant the return to normal expected redemption processes.
b. The 1773 Counterfeiting Scare
Early in 1773, notes of the 1769 and 1771 emissions were discovered to have been
counterfeited “…in so ingenious and dangerous a manner that it is difficult to distinguish the
forged from the good bills,…” (Hening 1969, v. 8, p. 648; Kennedy 1905, pp. viii-xi, 7, 9-10, 267) The assembly moved swiftly to mitigate the impact. They required all notes from emissions
#14 and #15 still outstanding to be swapped for new notes in 1773 and hunted down the
counterfeiters (Hening 1969, v. 8, pp. 647-51; Kennedy 1905, pp. viii-xi, 7, 9-10, 15-16, 18-20,
23-4, 27, 29-32, 35, 264). If the public expected the actions of the assembly to be ineffectual,
they would have discounted the notes severely, i.e. generated a RD > 0 into the near future, to
account for the risk that not all notes could now be redeemed as legislatively promised and that
their notes might be rejected in trade or for redemption at the treasury because they might be
counterfeit (Ernst 1973, pp. 331-4).
Figure 1, however, shows that this counterfeiting scare, while a topic of public discussion
and legislative action, had little impact on the value of the notes in circulation. Using the bestguess 6 percent discount rate, MEV exceeds APV in 1772 and 1774 by the normal TP amounts.

22

In 1773, MEV ≈ APV, thus leaving (TP - RD) ≈ 0. No significant RD > 0 appears in this period.
At best, a 4 to 6 percentage point dip and then return in TP occurs from 1772 to 1773 to 1774.
This result is important because stories of counterfeiting have given the impression that
colonial bills of credit were problematic monies or even worthless monies (Ernst 1973, pp. 3314; Scott 1957). The evidence in Figure 1 indicates that counterfeiting had a minor and very
temporary economic impact on the value and performance of Virginia’s paper money. While this
is the first systematic quantitative measure of the impact of a significant counterfeiting episode
on the value of colonial paper monies, it raises the possibility that counterfeiting is an overdramatized topic. Colonial governments had the tools to mitigate the impact of counterfeiting
quickly and almost completely, and they employed these tools when necessary.
c. The r* Analysis
Figure 2 shows the same results from an alternative angle. It displays r* from 1755
through 1774 along with the legal interest rate and my best-guess normal time-discount rate of 6
percent. In the first three years of the paper money regime, 1755-7, r* is around the normal range
of risk-free discount rates, implying that the notes’ MEV is largely determined by APV. The
notes are primarily a low risk barter asset in these years.
The imputed r* drops well below the risk-free discount rate from 1758 through 1762, and
again from 1766 through 1772. These below-normal r* rates do not represent the normal market
rate being driven down by an increased emission of paper money. No contemporary writer or any
other evidence indicates that normal interest rates were as low as r* in these years, and in the
second period the amount of notes in circulation experienced substantial contraction not
expansion. In other words, the proposition, TP > 0, cannot be rejected in these years.
Figure 2 also shows the periods when RD > 0 due to suspicion of potential non-

redemption. The malfeasance suspected and then revealed at the treasury between 1763 and 1766
appears as a spike in r*, reaching 9 percent by 1765 before returning to its typical non-crisis
range thereafter. Because no evidence indicates that risk-free discount rates were ever in the 9
percent range, this finding implies that TP ≈ 0 and RD > 0 in these years. The notes were risky
barter assets in these years. Figure 2 also shows the relatively minor nature of the counterfeiting
scare in 1773. While the scare briefly eliminated any TP > 0 attached to the notes, it left there
use in the range of free-risk barter assets, rather than risky barter assets.

best-guess 6 percent discount rate for APV. MEV is a trend stationary series, with a structural
break at 1766. APV is a stationary series with a structural break at 1766. Both have short halflives to shocks. MEV and APV are also co-integrated. Thus, estimating APV’s effect on MEV
over time is a valid exercise. Panel C in Table 3 reports that effect. APVt has a statistically
significant positive effect on MEVt with a relatively large coefficient magnitude. Statistically,

25

APV and MEV are closely associated. MEV tracks APV through time.
I estimate the determinants of TP, i.e. the determinants of the “moneyness” value of
Virginia’s treasury notes, net of RD, in Table 3, panel D. (TP - RD)t is measured by (MEV APV)t, see equation (3). Because (TP - RD) cannot be decomposed empirically, careful
interpretation of the independent variables is required to assess ∆TP versus ∆RD. Because TP is
likely a negative function of RD, behaviorally, with TP quickly driven to zero when RD takes on
positive values, positive independent variables are likely capturing positive movements in TP. 12
The regression explains 42 percent of the variance in (TP - RD)t. Controlling for the
amount of notes in circulation per capita, the 1766-1774 structural break variable is significantly
associated with higher TP in those years, see also Figure 1. The structural break captures the shift
from the old treasurer, John Robinson, who was suspected of malfeasance, to a new treasurer,
Robert Carter Nicholas. This transition removed the RD that arose in the early 1760s caused by
suspicions that the specie in the treasury that was to be used to redeem notes had been
misappropriated by Robinson, and allowed TP to once again take on positive values.
This result is also important for assessing the impact of the 1764 Currency Act that
removed legal tender status from new issues of colonial paper money. The Parliamentary
removal of legal tender status of colonial paper monies did not reduce the TP or “moneyness”
value Virginians placed on their own treasury notes. Legal tender status apparently was not
necessary for the notes to be the preferred medium of exchange in local transactions. Moving the
structural break variable one year back or one year forward from 1766 reduces the regression fit,
i.e. 1766 is a local maximum. This finding indicates that the 1764 Currency Act was a non-issue
regarding the performance and value of Virginia’s notes (Grubb 2016). The 1764 Currency Act
was more a political issue, than an economic issue (Brock 1975, pp. 465-527; Ernst 1973).

See fns. 4 and 6.

The most interesting result in Table 3, panel D, is the positive and significant effect of the
amount of paper money per capita on (TP - RD). Placing more paper money in circulation
regardless of which treasurer was in charge, increased the strain on executing redemptions as
promised. As such, RD should not fall, and so increases in TP must account for this positive
association. More paper money in circulation per capita increased its ubiquity and familiarity of
usage, which in turn led the public to increasingly treat this money as fiat-like currency, namely
adding value to the money above its real-asset present value. This process was accomplished by
the public not time-discounting these notes when used in trade as much as would be required if
they were just non-money zero-coupon barter bonds. As more paper money was put into
circulation, it increasingly became the preferred medium of exchange for local transactions, as
revealed by the fact that citizens were willing to pay a positive TP for it. As such, treasury notes
increasingly displaced other means of making transactions, such as barter, book credit, tobacco
claims, and specie coins.
This last result is an important finding for deciphering the performance of colonial paper
monies. Because the transaction premium was positively associated with the quantity of paper
money in circulation, it absorbed the pressure to reduce the value of the paper money that sprang
from increases in the quantity of paper money. Within the limits of an under-monetized
economy, increases in the quantity of paper money increased its “moneyness” value by
increasing its usefulness as an internal medium of exchange within that economy. This
association siphoned off or dampened the price inflation expected from increases in the paper
money supply. As such, the classical quantity theory of money may perform poorly when used to
assess the value and performance of colonial paper monies, compared with the application of my
decomposition model of inside monies.

27

The Quantity Theory of Money
The quantity theory of money has not been statistically applied to Virginia’s paper money
regime before (Brock 1975, p. 476). Table 4, panel A, provides this application using a
constructed price index (P) as the dependent variable. The specification is adapted from West
(1978, p. 4) so the results have some comparability with quantity-theoretic estimates done for
other colonies. 13 No statistically systematic relationships between prices and the quantities of
paper money exist for Virginia. The results are the same as those found by West (1978) for South
Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New York.
Panel B in Table 4 substitutes MEV in place of P. Prices are based on a small, though
relatively important, number of goods. Prices also might not represent exchanges using paper
money, as opposed to just being expressed in the paper money’s unit-of-account. As such, the
market exchange rate (MEV) between paper money and pounds sterling might be a better
measure of value than prices in the quantity-theory-of-money formulation.
Under a quantity-theoretic approach, an increase in the amount of paper money, other
things equal, should lead to an increase in prices, including an increase in the paper money price
of sterling bills of exchange. An increase in the average sterling bill-of-exchange exchange rate,
given that it is used as the denominator to calculate MEV, would cause MEV to fall. Thus,
changes in MEV should be negatively associated with changes in M. Table 4, panel B, tests for
this association. Replacing P with MEV does not improve the results. No statistically systematic
relationships between MEV and the quantities of paper money exist for Virginia. The relative
13

The classical quantity theory of money, at least a prominent version, takes the equation-of-exchange identity, MV
= PY, as expressed in growth rates, ln(M) + ln(V) = ln(P) + ln(Y), and by assuming that ln(V) and ln(Y) are longrun constants transforms it into the quantity “theory” of money [ln(M) + some constant = ln(P) + some constant] or
[ln(P) = some constant + ln(M)]; where M = the money supply, V = the velocity of that money’s circulation, P =
prices in that money, and Y = traded real output (Bordo 1987; Fisher 1912). West (1978) set M equal to the paper
money supply and estimated ln(P) = some constant + ln(M), including one and two-year lags of M to capture
delayed effects of M on P. He estimated the model separately for South Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, and
Massachusetts. He found no relationship between prices and the quantity of paper money in the first three colonies.

high adjusted R2 is all due to serial correlation. No matter how you slice it, the quantity theory of
money cannot explain the value and performance of Virginia’s paper money.
Conclusion
Colonial paper money is a Gordian knot. I have untied that knot. My decomposition
model of inside money explains the level and movement in the value of colonial Virginia’s paper
money better than what has been done previously, either by alternative model estimations or by
anecdotal story-telling. These are not marginal improvements, but quantum leaps in both

29

conceptualization and modeling statistical performance.
Virginia’s paper money was predominantly a real barter asset with its real-asset present
value explaining most of the level and movement in its observed market value. It functioned
predominantly as a zero-coupon bond and not a fiat currency. It did, however, have a small
transaction premium in normal years, enough to make it the preferred medium of exchange for
domestic transactions. This transaction premium was positively related to the per capita quantity
of paper money in circulation. As the quantity of paper money increased, it gained ubiquity and
familiarity of use, leading citizens to pay a premium above its real-asset present value as it was
now a better medium of exchange for executing local transactions than the next best alternative.
In effect, citizens reduced the time-discounting they applied to the notes, thereby beginning a
transition of the notes from being a barter asset toward having fiat currency characteristics. This
process identifies one mechanism by which asset monies can transition into a fiat currency. This
positive association of a transaction premium with the quantity of paper money in circulation,
within an under-monetized economy, also siphoned off price inflation pressures coming from
increases in the paper money supply. Finally, in years with monetary troubles, i.e. redemption
worries, the paper money experienced a moderate risk discount to its real-asset present value.
Counterfeiting, however, was not a major worry. The legislature had the tools and used them to
effectively mitigate and stop the effect of counterfeiting on the value of its paper money. The
value and performance of Virginia’s paper money are consistently and coherently explained over
its entire history, both conceptually and statistically, by my decomposition model for inside
monies.
