                                            ABSTRACT

We construct housing price indices for 120 major cities in China in 2003-2013 based on sequential
sales of new homes within the same housing developments. By using these indices and detailed information
on mortgage borrowers across these cities, we find enormous housing price appreciation during the
decade, which was accompanied by equally impressive growth in household income, except in a few
first-tier cities. While bottom-income mortgage borrowers endured severe financial burdens by using
price-to-income ratios over eight to buy homes, their participation in the housing market remained
steady and their mortgage loans were protected by down payments commonly in excess of 35 percent.
As such, the housing market is unlikely to trigger an imminent financial crisis in China, even though
it may crash with a sudden stop in the Chinese economy and act as an amplifier of the initial shock.

       There	  have	  been	  growing	  concerns	  across	  the	  global	  economic	  and	  policy	  communities	  
regarding	  the	  decade-­‐long	  housing	  market	  boom	  in	  China,	  which	  has	  the	  second	  largest	  
economy	  in	  the	  world	  and	  has	  been	  the	  major	  engine	  for	  global	  economic	  growth	  during	  the	  
past	  decade.	  News	  in	  recent	  months	  seems	  to	  suggest	  that	  the	  housing	  boom	  might	  be	  slowing	  
down.	  A	  main	  concern	  is	  that	  a	  housing	  market	  meltdown	  might	  severely	  damage	  the	  Chinese	  
economy,	  which	  in	  turn	  might	  generate	  contagious	  effects	  across	  the	  world	  and	  slow	  down	  the	  
fragile	  global	  economy	  that	  has	  just	  emerged	  from	  a	  series	  of	  crises	  that	  originated	  in	  the	  U.S.	  
and	  Europe.	  	  In	  particular,	  critics	  are	  concerned	  that	  soaring	  housing	  prices	  and	  the	  enormous	  
construction	  boom	  throughout	  the	  country	  might	  cause	  China	  to	  follow	  in	  the	  footsteps	  of	  
Japan,	  which	  had	  an	  economic	  lost	  decade	  after	  its	  housing	  bubble	  burst	  in	  the	  early	  1990s.	  	  	  	  	  

       How	  much	  have	  housing	  prices	  in	  China	  appreciated	  during	  the	  last	  decade?	  How	  did	  the	  
price	  appreciation	  vary	  across	  different	  Chinese	  cities?	  Did	  the	  soaring	  prices	  exclude	  low-­‐
income	  households	  from	  participating	  in	  the	  housing	  markets?	  How	  much	  financial	  burden	  did	  
households	  face	  in	  buying	  homes?	  Addressing	  these	  questions	  is	  crucial	  for	  systematically	  
assessing	  the	  risk	  to	  the	  Chinese	  economy	  presented	  by	  its	  housing	  market.	  	  	  We	  address	  these	  
questions	  by	  taking	  advantage	  of	  a	  comprehensive	  data	  set	  of	  mortgage	  loans	  issued	  by	  a	  major	  
Chinese	  commercial	  bank	  from	  2003-­‐2013.	  Specifically,	  we	  construct	  a	  set	  of	  housing	  price	  
indices	  for	  120	  major	  cities	  in	  China,	  which	  allows	  us	  to	  evaluate	  housing	  price	  fluctuations	  
across	  these	  cities,	  in	  conjunction	  with	  the	  growth	  of	  households’	  purchasing	  power	  and	  stock	  
price	  fluctuations.	  The	  detailed	  mortgage	  data	  also	  allow	  us	  to	  analyze	  the	  participation	  of	  low-­‐
income	  households	  in	  housing	  markets	  and	  the	  financial	  burdens	  faced	  by	  low-­‐income	  home	  
buyers.	  

       Due	  to	  the	  nascent	  nature	  of	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  market,	  there	  are	  relatively	  few	  repeat	  
home	  sales	  available	  for	  building	  Case-­‐Shiller	  type	  repeated	  sales	  housing	  indices.	  Instead,	  we	  
take	  advantage	  of	  the	  large	  number	  of	  new	  housing	  developments	  in	  each	  city	  and	  build	  a	  
housing	  price	  index	  for	  the	  city	  based	  on	  sales	  over	  time	  of	  new	  homes	  within	  the	  same	  
developments,	  which	  share	  similar	  characteristics	  and	  amenities.	  Consistent	  with	  casual	  
observations	  made	  by	  many	  commentators,	  our	  price	  indices	  confirm	  enormous	  housing	  price	  


                                                                                                                                                               1	  
	  
appreciation	  across	  China	  in	  2003-­‐2013.	  	  In	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  which	  include	  the	  four	  most	  
populated	  and	  most	  economically	  important	  metropolitan	  areas	  in	  China-­‐-­‐	  Beijing,	  Shanghai,	  
Guangzhou,	  and	  Shenzhen-­‐-­‐	  housing	  prices	  had	  an	  average	  annual	  real	  growth	  rate	  of	  13.1	  
percent	  during	  this	  decade.	  Our	  sample	  also	  covers	  31	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  which	  are	  
autonomous	  municipalities,	  provincial	  capitals,	  or	  vital	  industrial/commercial	  centers,	  and	  85	  
other	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  which	  are	  important	  cities	  in	  their	  respective	  regions.	  Housing	  prices	  in	  
second-­‐tier	  cities	  had	  an	  average	  annual	  real	  growth	  rate	  of	  10.5	  percent;	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  had	  
an	  average	  annual	  real	  growth	  rate	  of	  7.9	  percent.	  These	  growth	  rates	  easily	  surpass	  the	  
housing	  price	  appreciation	  during	  the	  U.S.	  housing	  bubble	  in	  the	  2000s	  and	  are	  comparable	  to	  
that	  during	  the	  Japanese	  housing	  bubble	  in	  the	  1980s.	  	  	  

       Despite	  the	  enormous	  price	  appreciation,	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  boom	  is	  different	  in	  nature	  
from	  the	  housing	  bubbles	  in	  the	  U.S.	  and	  Japan.	  Our	  analysis	  offers	  several	  important	  
observations	  that	  are	  useful	  for	  understanding	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  boom.	  First,	  as	  banks	  in	  
China	  imposed	  down	  payments	  of	  over	  30	  percent	  on	  all	  mortgage	  loans,	  banks	  are	  protected	  
from	  mortgage	  borrowers’	  default	  risk	  even	  in	  the	  event	  of	  a	  sizable	  housing	  market	  meltdown	  
of	  30	  percent.	  This	  makes	  a	  U.S.	  style	  subprime	  credit	  crisis	  less	  likely	  in	  China.	  	  

       Second,	  while	  the	  rapid	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  has	  been	  often	  highlighted	  as	  a	  concern	  
for	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  market,	  the	  price	  appreciation	  was	  accompanied	  by	  equally	  spectacular	  
growth	  in	  households’	  disposable	  income-­‐-­‐-­‐an	  average	  annual	  real	  growth	  rate	  of	  about	  9.0	  
percent	  throughout	  the	  country	  during	  the	  decade,	  with	  the	  exception	  of	  a	  lower	  average	  
growth	  rate	  of	  6.6	  percent	  in	  the	  first-­‐tier	  cities.	  This	  joint	  presence	  of	  enormous	  housing	  price	  
appreciation	  and	  income	  growth	  contrasts	  the	  experiences	  during	  the	  U.S.	  and	  Japanese	  
housing	  bubble.	  Even	  during	  the	  Japanese	  housing	  bubble	  in	  late	  1980s,	  the	  Japanese	  economy	  
was	  growing	  at	  a	  more	  modest	  rate	  than	  that	  of	  China.	  The	  enormous	  income	  growth	  rate	  
across	  Chinese	  cities	  thus	  provides	  some	  assurance	  to	  the	  housing	  boom	  and,	  together	  with	  the	  
aforementioned	  high	  mortgage	  down	  payment	  ratios,	  renders	  the	  housing	  market	  an	  unlikely	  
trigger	  for	  an	  imminent	  financial	  crisis	  in	  China.	  	  




                                                                                                                                                     2	  
	  
       Third,	  despite	  the	  enormous	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  over	  the	  decade,	  the	  participation	  
of	  low-­‐income	  households	  in	  the	  housing	  market	  remained	  stable.	  	  Specifically,	  we	  analyze	  the	  
financial	  status	  of	  mortgage	  borrowers	  with	  incomes	  in	  the	  bottom	  10	  percent	  of	  all	  mortgage	  
borrowers	  in	  each	  city	  for	  each	  year.	  By	  mapping	  the	  incomes	  of	  these	  marginal	  home	  buyers	  
into	  the	  income	  distribution	  of	  the	  urban	  population	  in	  the	  city,	  we	  find	  that	  they	  came	  from	  
the	  low-­‐income	  fraction	  of	  the	  population,	  roughly	  around	  the	  25th	  percentile	  of	  the	  
distribution	  in	  the	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  and	  around	  the	  30th	  percentile	  in	  the	  second-­‐tier	  cities.	  

       Fourth,	  while	  these	  low-­‐income	  home	  buyers	  were	  not	  excluded	  from	  the	  housing	  market,	  
they	  did	  endure	  enormous	  financial	  burdens	  in	  buying	  homes	  at	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios	  of	  
around	  eight	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  and,	  in	  some	  years,	  even	  over	  ten	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities.	  	  
In	  concrete	  terms,	  this	  means	  that	  a	  household	  paid	  eight	  times	  its	  annual	  disposable	  income	  to	  
buy	  a	  home.	  In	  order	  to	  obtain	  a	  mortgage	  loan,	  it	  had	  to	  make	  a	  down	  payment	  of	  at	  least	  30	  
percent,	  and	  more	  	  typically	  40	  percent,	  of	  the	  home	  price,	  which	  was	  equivalent	  to	  2.4	  times	  	  
to	  3.2	  times	  	  the	  household’s	  annual	  income.	  Suppose	  that	  the	  household	  made	  a	  down	  
payment	  of	  40	  percent	  and	  took	  a	  mortgage	  loan	  for	  the	  other	  60	  percent	  of	  the	  home	  price,	  
which	  would	  be	  4.8	  times	  its	  annual	  income.	  A	  modest	  mortgage	  rate	  of	  6	  percent,	  which	  is	  low	  
relative	  to	  the	  actual	  rate	  observed	  during	  the	  decade,	  would	  require	  the	  household	  to	  use	  
nearly	  30	  percent	  of	  its	  annual	  income	  to	  pay	  for	  the	  interest	  on	  the	  mortgage	  loan.	  
Furthermore,	  paying	  the	  mortgage	  would	  consume	  another	  16	  percent	  of	  its	  annual	  income	  
used	  a	  linear	  amortization	  even	  if	  the	  mortgage	  had	  a	  maximum	  maturity	  of	  30	  years.	  Together,	  
buying	  the	  home	  entailed	  saving	  3.2	  times	  the	  annual	  household	  income	  to	  make	  the	  down	  
payment	  and	  another	  45	  percent	  of	  its	  annual	  income	  to	  service	  the	  mortgage	  loan.	  	  

       To	  explain	  the	  willingness	  of	  households	  to	  endure	  such	  severe	  financial	  burdens	  for	  a	  home,	  
it	  is	  important	  to	  take	  into	  account	  the	  households’	  expectations.	  To	  the	  extent	  that	  urban	  
household	  income	  in	  China	  has	  been	  rising	  steadily	  during	  the	  studied	  period,	  as	  well	  as	  in	  the	  
previous	  two	  decades,	  many	  households	  may	  expect	  their	  income	  to	  continue	  growing	  at	  this	  
rate.	  At	  a	  10	  percent	  nominal	  income	  growth	  rate,	  a	  household’s	  income	  in	  five	  years	  would	  
grow	  to	  1.6	  times	  of	  its	  initial	  income	  and	  the	  ratio	  of	  current	  housing	  price	  to	  its	  future	  income	  


                                                                                                                                                                 3	  
	  
in	  five	  years	  would	  drop	  to	  five.	  Thus,	  a	  high	  expected	  income	  growth	  rate	  renders	  the	  
aforementioned	  financial	  burdens	  temporary.	  	  

       Such	  high	  income	  growth	  expectations	  might	  have	  resulted	  from	  extrapolative	  behavior	  as	  
emphasized	  by	  Barberis,	  Shleifer,	  and	  Vishny	  (1998)	  and	  Shiller	  (2000),	  or	  from	  contagious	  
social	  dynamics	  between	  households	  as	  modeled	  by	  Burnside,	  Eichenbaum,	  and	  Rebelo	  (2013).	  
Recently,	  Pritchett	  and	  Summers	  (2014)	  examine	  historical	  data	  on	  growth	  rates	  and	  
demonstrate	  that	  regression	  to	  the	  mean	  is	  the	  single	  most	  robust	  and	  empirically	  relevant	  fact	  
about	  cross-­‐country	  growth	  rates.	  Thus,	  they	  argue	  that	  while	  China	  might	  continue	  to	  grow	  for	  
another	  two	  decades	  at	  a	  9,	  or	  even	  a	  7	  or	  6	  percent	  rate,	  such	  continued	  rapid	  growth	  rate	  
would	  be	  an	  extraordinary	  event,	  given	  the	  powerful	  force	  of	  regression	  to	  the	  mean,	  which	  
had	  averaged	  2	  percent	  in	  the	  cross-­‐country	  data	  with	  a	  standard	  deviation	  of	  2	  percent.	  If	  so,	  
the	  high	  expectation	  of	  future	  income	  growth,	  which	  might	  have	  been	  a	  key	  driver	  of	  the	  
observed	  enormous	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios,	  may	  not	  be	  sustainable	  and	  thus	  presents	  an	  
important	  source	  of	  risk	  to	  the	  housing	  market.	  When	  China’s	  growth	  rate	  eventually	  regresses	  
to	  the	  mean,	  and	  especially	  when	  China	  experiences	  a	  sudden	  stop,	  households’	  expectations	  
may	  crash.	  In	  such	  a	  case,	  the	  large	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios	  have	  substantial	  room	  to	  contract,	  
which	  in	  turn	  could	  act	  as	  an	  amplifier	  of	  the	  initial	  shock	  that	  triggers	  the	  economic	  slowdown.	  

       Frictions	  in	  the	  Chinese	  financial	  system	  might	  also	  have	  contributed	  to	  the	  high	  housing	  
prices	  across	  Chinese	  cities,	  as	  reflected	  by	  the	  large	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios	  endured	  by	  
households.	  It	  is	  well-­‐known	  that	  the	  spectacular	  economic	  growth	  in	  China	  since	  the	  1980s	  has	  
been	  accompanied	  by	  a	  high	  savings	  rate,	  e.g.,	  Yang,	  Zhang,	  and	  Zhou	  (2013).	  Due	  to	  stringent	  
capital	  controls,	  savers	  cannot	  invest	  their	  savings	  in	  international	  capital	  markets	  and,	  instead,	  
have	  only	  a	  few	  domestic	  investment	  vehicles.	  Bank	  deposit	  accounts	  have	  remained	  the	  
predominant	  investment	  vehicle,	  with	  assets	  totaling	  near	  100	  trillion	  RMB	  in	  2013,	  despite	  the	  
fact	  that	  the	  real	  one-­‐year	  deposit	  rate	  averaged	  only	  0.01	  percent	  in	  2003-­‐2013.	  While	  the	  
Chinese	  stock	  market	  experienced	  dramatic	  growth	  during	  this	  decade,	  it	  was	  still	  relatively	  
small,	  with	  a	  capitalization	  of	  slightly	  less	  than	  20	  trillion	  RMB	  in	  2013.	  The	  size	  of	  bond	  markets	  
was	  even	  smaller.	  Facing	  this	  largely	  constrained	  investment	  set,	  it	  has	  been	  common	  for	  


                                                                                                                                                         4	  
	  
households	  to	  treat	  housing	  as	  an	  alternative	  investment	  vehicle,	  which	  also	  helps	  explain	  their	  
willingness	  to	  pay	  dearly	  for	  housing.	  	  	  	  	  

       From	  an	  investment	  perspective,	  it	  is	  interesting	  to	  note	  a	  tale	  of	  two	  markets	  at	  the	  time	  of	  
the	  world	  economic	  crisis	  in	  2008-­‐2009.	  During	  this	  period,	  the	  Chinese	  economy	  faced	  
tremendous	  pressure.	  Nevertheless,	  the	  housing	  market	  in	  China	  remained	  strong.	  Housing	  
prices	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  suffered	  a	  modest	  drop	  of	  about	  10	  percent,	  and	  recovered	  more	  than	  
the	  loss	  shortly	  after	  the	  crisis.	  Housing	  prices	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  continued	  to	  rise	  
throughout	  the	  period	  after	  2008.	  This	  experience	  was	  in	  sharp	  contrast	  to	  the	  dramatic	  decline	  
of	  over	  60	  percent	  in	  the	  Chinese	  stock	  market	  in	  2008-­‐-­‐which	  has	  not	  been	  recovered	  even	  to	  
date.	  To	  understand	  this	  puzzling	  contrast,	  we	  argue	  that	  the	  frequent	  policy	  interventions	  by	  
the	  central	  government	  and	  the	  heavy	  reliance	  of	  local	  governments	  on	  land	  sales	  revenue	  for	  
their	  fiscal	  budget	  might	  have	  emboldened	  many	  households	  to	  believe	  that	  the	  housing	  
market	  is	  too	  important	  to	  fall	  and	  that	  the	  central	  government	  would	  institute	  policies	  to	  
support	  the	  housing	  market	  if	  necessary.	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

       There	  are	  divergent	  views	  about	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  boom.	  Chow	  and	  Niu	  (2014)	  use	  a	  
simultaneous	  equations	  framework	  to	  analyze	  the	  demand	  and	  supply	  of	  residential	  housing	  in	  
urban	  China	  in	  1987-­‐2012	  and	  find	  that	  the	  rapid	  housing	  price	  growth	  can	  be	  well	  explained	  by	  
the	  force	  of	  demand	  and	  supply,	  with	  income	  determining	  demand	  and	  construction	  costs	  
affecting	  supply.	  Deng,	  Gyourko,	  and	  Wu	  (2014b)	  are	  far	  more	  concerned	  by	  the	  risk	  in	  the	  
Chinese	  housing	  market.	  In	  particular,	  they	  present	  evidence	  of	  a	  rapid	  increase	  in	  housing	  
supply	  and	  housing	  inventory	  held	  by	  developers	  in	  various	  major	  cities	  in	  recent	  years.	  
Different	  from	  these	  studies,	  we	  provide	  an	  informed	  account	  of	  the	  demand	  side	  by	  
thoroughly	  analyzing	  characteristics	  of	  mortgage	  borrowers.	  Our	  analysis	  leads	  us	  to	  take	  a	  
more	  balanced	  stand	  between	  these	  two	  contrasting	  views.	  On	  the	  comforting	  side,	  the	  rapid	  
income	  growth,	  which	  accompanied	  the	  enormous	  housing	  price	  appreciation,	  helped	  support	  
the	  steady	  participation	  by	  low-­‐income	  households	  in	  the	  housing	  market.	  On	  the	  concerning	  
side,	  high	  expectations	  about	  future	  income	  growth	  might	  have	  motivated	  low-­‐income	  




                                                                                                                                                            5

                             This	  paper	  is	  organized	  as	  follows.	  Section	  1	  briefly	  describes	  some	  institutional	  background.	  
We	  introduce	  the	  housing	  price	  indices	  in	  Section	  2	  and	  then	  discuss	  the	  housing	  price	  boom	  
across	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities	  in	  Section	  3.	  Section	  4	  summarizes	  characteristics	  of	  mortgage

                             The	  development	  of	  housing	  markets	  in	  mainland	  China	  is	  a	  relatively	  new	  phenomenon.	  
From	  the	  1949	  founding	  of	  the	  People’s	  Republic	  of	  China	  to	  1978,	  all	  land	  was	  publicly	  owned	  
and	  the	  Chinese	  constitution	  prohibited	  any	  organization	  or	  individual	  from	  buying,	  selling,	  
leasing,	  or	  transferring	  land.	  Housing	  was	  allocated	  through	  a	  working	  unit-­‐employee	  linkage	  as	  
a	  form	  of	  in-­‐kind	  compensation,	  with	  the	  size	  and	  location	  of	  homes	  depending	  on	  the	  length	  of	  
employment	  and	  the	  size	  of	  the	  household,	  among	  other	  factors.	  In	  1978,	  per	  capita	  residential	  
area	  in	  urban	  areas	  was	  3.6	  square	  meters,	  which	  was	  even	  lower	  than	  that	  in	  1949.	  

                             To	  reform	  (and	  to	  a	  large	  extent	  privatize)	  the	  state-­‐owned	  enterprises	  in	  the	  mid-­‐1980s,	  it	  
was	  considered	  necessary	  to	  introduce	  an	  alternative	  housing	  system	  that	  would	  delink	  home	  
allocation	  from	  employment.	  An	  important	  milestone	  occurred	  in	  1988	  when	  the	  Chinese	  
constitution	  was	  amended	  to	  allow	  for	  land	  transactions,	  which	  set	  the	  legal	  stage	  for	  the	  
privatization	  of	  housing	  in	  China.1	  	  

                             Comprehensive	  housing	  reform	  was	  initiated	  in	  1994	  when	  employees	  in	  the	  state	  sector	  
were	  allowed	  to	  purchase	  full	  or	  partial	  property	  rights	  to	  their	  current	  apartment	  units	  at	  
subsidized	  prices.	  Nascent	  markets	  for	  homes,	  known	  as	  “commodity	  houses,”	  emerged	  in

 	  Under	  current	  law,	  land	  used	  to	  build	  residential	  properties	  is	  leased	  for	  a	  term	  of	  70	  years;	  after	  the	  expiration	  
of	  the	  lease	  period,	  the	  right	  to	  use	  the	  land	  and	  the	  property	  will	  no	  longer	  belong	  to	  the	  current	  owner.	  It	  is	  
commonly	  presumed	  that	  the	  law	  will	  eventually	  be	  amended	  so	  that	  property	  owners	  will	  be	  allowed	  to	  renew	  
the	  leases.	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         6	  
	  
some	  large	  cities	  in	  early	  1990s;	  but	  they	  grew	  rapidly	  only	  after	  1998	  when	  the	  central	  
government	  completely	  abolished	  the	  traditional	  model	  of	  housing	  allocation	  as	  an	  in-­‐kind	  
benefit	  and	  privatized	  housing	  properties	  of	  all	  urban	  residents.	  	  

                             Also	  in	  1998,	  partly	  as	  a	  response	  to	  the	  adverse	  effects	  of	  the	  1997	  Asian	  Financial	  Crisis,	  
the	  Chinese	  government	  established	  the	  real	  estate	  sector	  as	  a	  new	  engine	  of	  economic	  growth.	  
As	  an	  important	  impetus	  to	  the	  development	  of	  private	  housing	  markets,	  China’s	  central	  bank,	  
the	  People’s	  Bank	  of	  China	  (PBC),	  outlined	  the	  procedures	  for	  home	  buyers	  to	  obtain	  residential	  
mortgages	  at	  subsidized	  interest	  rates	  in	  1998.2	  Moreover,	  between	  1998	  and	  2002,	  the	  PBC	  
lowered	  the	  mortgage	  interest	  rate	  five	  times	  to	  encourage	  home	  purchases.	  By	  2005,	  China	  
had	  become	  the	  largest	  residential	  mortgage	  market	  in	  Asia.	  According	  to	  a	  PBC	  report	  
published	  in	  2013,	  financial	  institutions	  made	  a	  total	  of	  8.1	  trillion	  RMB	  in	  mortgage	  loans	  in	  
2012,	  accounting	  for	  16	  percent	  of	  all	  bank	  loans	  in	  that	  year.	  At	  the	  same	  time,	  the	  PBC	  also	  
developed	  policies	  to	  encourage	  housing	  development,	  including	  broadening	  the	  scope	  of	  
development	  loans	  and	  allowing	  pre-­‐sales	  by	  developers.	  	  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [Figure	  1	  about	  Here]

                             These	  policies	  were	  effective	  in	  stimulating	  both	  the	  demand	  and	  supply	  of	  residential	  
housing.	  During	  this	  period,	  home	  sales	  maintained	  about	  15	  percent	  of	  annual	  growth	  on	  
average,	  and	  areas	  of	  residential	  housing	  under	  construction	  grew	  even	  faster,	  reaching	  about	  
18	  percent	  of	  annual	  growth.	  Figure	  1	  provides	  a	  rough	  estimate	  of	  the	  supply	  of	  newly	  
completed	  residential	  housing	  from	  2002-­‐2013	  by	  city	  tier,	  measured	  by	  completed	  areas	  in	  
each	  city	  and	  each	  year	  divided	  by	  the	  city’s	  urban	  population	  in	  2012.	  	  

                             It	  is	  common	  in	  China	  to	  separate	  cities	  into	  three	  tiers.	  The	  first	  tier	  includes	  the	  four	  cities

                             The	  construction	  boom	  of	  residential	  housing	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  started	  in	  the	  late	  1990s,	  
followed	  by	  that	  of	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  in	  the	  early	  2000s.	  In	  Figure	  1,	  new	  construction	  
of	  residential	  housing	  showed	  a	  similar	  growth	  rate	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities	  in	  2002-­‐2005.	  
From	  2005,	  the	  new	  construction	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  had	  slowed	  down	  substantially	  due	  to	  the	  
shortage	  of	  land	  supply	  in	  these	  cities,	  while	  the	  supply	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  
continued	  to	  grow	  at	  similar	  rate	  as	  before.	  The	  growth	  rate	  in	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  was	  especially	  
strong.	  Some	  estimates	  suggest	  that	  investment	  to	  residential	  housing	  accounted	  for	  25	  
percent	  of	  total	  fixed	  asset	  investment	  and	  contributed	  to	  roughly	  one-­‐sixth	  of	  China’s	  GDP	  
growth	  (Barth	  et	  al.,	  2012).	  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [Figure	  2	  about	  Here]

                             The	  development	  of	  the	  housing	  market	  was	  also	  accompanied	  by	  an	  urbanization	  process	  
throughout	  China	  with	  rural	  migrants	  moving	  into	  cities,	  especially	  into	  first-­‐	  and	  second-­‐tier	  
cities.	  As	  shown	  by	  Figure	  2,	  the	  total	  population	  of	  the	  four	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  the	  vast	  majority	  of	  
which	  lived	  inside	  the	  city	  proper,	  grew	  from	  48	  million	  in	  2004	  to	  almost	  70	  million	  in	  2012.	  
The	  total	  population	  of	  the	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  which	  is	  distributed	  roughly	  half	  inside	  the	  city	  
proper	  and	  half	  outside,	  grew	  from	  220	  million	  in	  2004	  to	  about	  260	  million	  in	  2012.	  The	  total	  
population	  of	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  remained	  stable	  in	  this	  period	  at	  around	  370	  million,	  among	  which	  
only	  100	  million	  lived	  inside	  the	  city	  proper.

price	  index	  arises	  because	  a	  good	  price	  index	  requires	  that	  we	  compare	  the	  prices	  of	  the	  same	  
(or	  at	  least	  comparable)	  houses	  over	  time.	  To	  the	  extent	  that	  the	  set	  of	  homes	  involved	  in	  the	  
transactions	  in	  different	  periods	  of	  time	  is	  likely	  to	  be	  different,	  a	  price	  index	  constructed	  by	  
simply	  comparing	  the	  mean	  or	  median	  sale	  prices	  per	  square	  meter	  likely	  measures	  not	  only	  
the	  changes	  in	  the	  prices	  of	  similar	  homes,	  but	  also	  the	  changes	  in	  the	  composition	  of	  
transacted	  homes.	  This	  problem	  is	  likely	  to	  be	  more	  severe	  in	  emerging	  housing	  markets	  than	  in	  
mature	  ones	  because	  in	  emerging	  housing	  markets,	  homes	  in	  more	  central	  locations	  are	  likely	  
to	  be	  built	  and	  transacted	  earlier	  than	  homes	  in	  city	  outer-­‐rings.	  

A. Standard	  Methodologies	  

       There	  are	  two	  standard	  methodologies	  that	  are	  widely	  used	  to	  construct	  housing	  price	  
indices.	  These	  methods,	  which	  we	  review	  briefly	  below,	  are	  aimed	  at	  finding	  a	  suitable	  way	  to	  
compare	  the	  prices	  of	  similar	  homes.	  

       One	  prominent	  approach	  for	  constructing	  housing	  price	  is	  to	  use	  hedonic	  price	  regressions,	  
which	  goes	  back	  to	  Kain	  and	  Quigley	  (1970).	  In	  this	  approach,	  the	  sales	  price	  is	  regressed	  on	  a	  
set	  of	  variables	  that	  characterize	  the	  housing	  unit	  -­‐-­‐number	  of	  rooms,	  square	  feet	  of	  interior	  
space,	  lot	  size,	  quality	  of	  construction,	  condition,	  and	  so	  forth.	  The	  regression	  coefficients	  can	  
be	  interpreted	  as	  prices	  for	  implicit	  attributes.	  This	  hedonic	  approach	  can	  then	  be	  used	  to	  
construct	  a	  price	  index	  in	  two	  ways	  (Case	  and	  Shiller,	  1987).	  The	  first	  way	  to	  construct	  a	  price	  
index	  is	  to	  run	  separate	  regressions	  on	  data	  from	  each	  time	  period.	  The	  estimated	  equations	  
are	  then	  used	  to	  predict	  the	  value	  of	  a	  standard	  unit	  in	  each	  period,	  which	  is	  in	  turn	  used	  to	  
construct	  the	  housing	  price	  index	  for	  the	  standard	  unit.	  A	  second	  way	  is	  to	  run	  a	  single	  
regression	  on	  the	  pooled	  data	  from	  sales	  in	  all	  time	  periods.	  Inclusion	  of	  a	  time	  dummy	  for	  the	  
period	  of	  the	  sale	  allows	  the	  constant	  term	  to	  shift	  over	  time,	  reflecting	  movement	  in	  prices,	  
again	  controlling	  for	  characteristics.	  

       Whether	  hedonic	  price	  regressions	  can	  accurately	  capture	  price	  movements	  crucially	  
depends	  on	  how	  well	  the	  data	  capture	  the	  actual	  characteristics	  and	  quality	  of	  the	  unit.	  
Unobserved	  and	  time	  varying	  characteristics	  that	  are	  valued	  by	  the	  market	  but	  not	  captured	  in	  
the	  data	  can	  lead	  to	  biased	  estimates	  of	  the	  housing	  price	  index.	  This	  is	  a	  particular	  issue	  in	  

                                                                                                                                                              9	  
	  
China.	  Due	  to	  the	  rapid	  expansion	  of	  Chinese	  cities,	  new	  housing	  units	  have	  been	  constructed	  
mostly	  on	  land	  near	  the	  urban	  fringes.	  According	  to	  the	  China	  Urban	  Statistical	  Yearbook	  
(published	  by	  Ministry	  of	  Housing	  and	  Urban-­‐Rural	  Development),	  the	  total	  size	  of	  developed	  
urban	  area	  at	  the	  national	  level	  increased	  from	  19,844	  square	  kilometers	  in	  2003	  (Form	  3-­‐9	  on	  
page	  107)	  to	  34,867	  square	  kilometers	  in	  2013	  (Form	  2-­‐12	  on	  page	  90).	  Such	  a	  dramatic	  
expansion	  of	  urban	  residential	  land	  parcels	  implies	  that	  unobserved	  time	  varying	  characteristics	  
as	  transacted	  homes	  move	  from	  locations	  closer	  to	  city	  center	  to	  locations	  in	  city	  fringe	  is	  likely	  
to	  lead	  to	  biased	  housing	  price	  indices.	  

                             Case	  and	  Shiller	  (1987)	  popularized	  another	  method	  using	  repeated	  sales.	  	  This	  approach	  
originated	  with	  Baily,	  Muth,	  and	  Nourse	  (1963),	  who	  initially	  proposed	  a	  method	  involving	  a	  
regression	  where	  the	  𝑖 -­‐th	  observation	  of	  the	  dependent	  variable	  is	  the	  log	  of	  the	  price	  of	  the	  𝑖 -­‐
th	  house	  at	  its	  second	  sale	  date	  minus	  the	  log	  of	  its	  price	  on	  its	  first	  sale	  date.	  The	  independent	  
variables	  consist	  of	  only	  dummy	  variables,	  one	  for	  each	  time	  period	  in	  the	  sample	  except	  for	  
the	  first	  (the	  base	  period	  for	  the	  index).4	  The	  estimated	  coefficients	  are	  then	  taken	  as	  the	  log	  
price	  index.	  	  This	  initial	  method	  builds	  on	  a	  strong	  assumption	  that	  the	  variance	  of	  the	  error	  
term	  is	  constant	  across	  houses.	  	  As	  this	  variance	  is	  likely	  to	  depend	  on	  the	  time	  interval	  
between	  sales,	  Case	  and	  Shiller	  (1987)	  proposed	  a	  weighted-­‐repeated-­‐sales	  method	  with	  a	  two-­‐
step	  procedure	  to	  relax	  this	  assumption.5	  	  

                             The	  repeat	  sales	  approach	  does	  not	  require	  the	  measurement	  of	  quality;	  it	  only	  requires	  
that	  the	  quality	  of	  individual	  units	  in	  the	  sample	  remains	  constant	  over	  time.	  However,	  it	  is	  well	  
recognized	  that	  this	  repeated	  sales	  method	  wastes	  a	  large	  fraction	  of	  transactions	  data	  because	  
repeated	  sales	  may	  contribute	  to	  only	  a	  small	  fraction	  of	  all	  housing	  transactions.	  More	  
important,	  the	  set	  of	  homes	  that	  are	  sold	  repeatedly	  may	  not	  be	  representative	  of	  the	  general	  
population	  of	  homes	  (see	  Mark	  and	  Goldberg,	  1984).

  	  Specifically,	  for	  each	  house,	  the	  dummy	  variables	  are	  zero	  except	  for	  the	  dummy	  corresponding	  to	  the	  second	  
sale	  (where	  it	  is	  +1)	  and	  for	  the	  dummy	  corresponding	  to	  the	  first	  sale	  (where	  it	  is	  -­‐1).	  If	  the	  first	  sale	  was	  in	  the	  
first	  period,	  there	  is	  no	  dummy	  variable	  corresponding	  to	  the	  first	  sale.

  	  In	  the	  first	  stage,	  they	  implement	  the	  Baily,	  Muth,	  and	  Nourse	  (1963)	  procedure	  and	  calculate	  the	  vector	  of	  
regression	  residuals,	  which	  is	  then	  used	  to	  construct	  the	  weights	  to	  be	  used	  in	  the	  stage	  two	  regression.	  In	  the	  
second	  step,	  a	  generalized	  least	  squares	  regression	  (with	  weights	  constructed	  from	  the	  regression	  residuals	  in	  the

B. A	  Hybrid	  Approach	  for	  Chinese	  Housing	  Markets	  

                             We	  propose	  a	  hybrid	  approach	  of	  constructing	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  a	  large	  number	  of	  
Chinese	  cities.	  Our	  approach	  takes	  into	  account	  several	  features	  of	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  
markets.	  	  As	  a	  result	  of	  the	  nascent	  nature	  of	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  markets,	  there	  are	  relatively	  
few	  repeat	  sales.	  Many	  of	  the	  observed	  repeated	  sales	  are	  old-­‐style	  housing	  units,	  which	  are	  
not	  representative	  of	  the	  newly	  developed	  housing	  markets.	  This	  feature	  prevents	  us	  from	  
directly	  using	  the	  Case-­‐Shiller	  repeated	  sales	  method.	  On	  the	  other	  hand,	  there	  are	  a	  large	  
number	  of	  new	  home	  sales	  in	  each	  city.	  These	  new	  homes	  are	  in	  the	  form	  of	  apartments,	  and	  
typically,	  apartments	  in	  development	  projects.6	  As	  a	  developer	  sells	  apartments	  in	  a	  project	  
over	  a	  period	  of	  time,	  and	  sometimes	  even	  completes	  the	  development	  over	  several	  phases,	  
we	  observe	  sequential	  sales	  of	  apartments	  in	  the	  same	  development.	  Within	  the	  same	  
development	  project,	  the	  unobserved	  apartment	  amenities	  are	  similar.	  This	  feature	  allows	  us	  
to	  build	  a	  hybrid	  index	  based	  on	  sequential	  new	  home	  sales	  within	  housing	  developments	  after	  
accounting	  for	  hedonic	  characteristics	  of	  individual	  homes.	  	  

                             We	  implement	  the	  housing	  price	  indices	  from	  January	  2003	  to	  March	  2013	  by	  running	  the	  
following	  regression	  for	  each	  city:

 	  Statistical	  Yearbook	  of	  China,	  published	  by	  the	  Chinese	  National	  Bureau	  of	  Statistics,	  estimates	  that	  the

                             Figure	  3	  graphically	  illustrates	  our	  method	  of	  constructing	  the	  price	  index.	  In	  every	  month,	  
say	  month	  1,	  there	  are	  many	  development	  projects	  with	  new	  apartments	  for	  sale	  in	  a	  given	  
city.	  In	  Figure	  3,	  three	  units	  in	  development	  project	  A	  are	  sold	  in	  month	  1	  and	  two	  units	  are	  sold	  
in	  month	  2.	  We	  take	  the	  sales	  in	  our	  data	  from	  development	  projects	  that	  have	  sales	  in	  both	  
month	  1	  and	  month	  2.	  In	  our	  proposed	  regression	  above,	  we	  control	  for	  the	  development	  
project	  and	  other	  observable	  differences	  in	  the	  characteristics	  of	  the	  apartment	  units	  (such	  as	  
area,	  floor	  number,	  etc.),	  thus	  the	  time	  dummy	   β1 	  precisely	  captures	  the	  price	  difference	  

among	  otherwise	  identical	  units	  sold	  between	  month	  1	  and	  month	  2.	  Of	  course,	  the	  key	  
assumption,	  which	  we	  believe	  to	  be	  empirically	  realistic,	  is	  that	  within	  a	  development	  project,	  
differences	  in	  the	  units	  are	  fully	  described	  by	  the	  additional	  controls	  we	  include	  in	  the	  
regression.	  Similarly,	  as	  illustrated	  in	  Figure	  3,	  the	  price	  change	  from	  month	  2	  to	  month	  3	  is	  
estimated	  by	  the	  price	  differences	  of	  similar	  units	  in	  development	  project	  B	  sold	  in	  month	  2	  
versus	  those	  sold	  in	  month	  3;	  the	  price	  change	  from	  month	  3	  to	  month	  4	  is	  estimated	  by	  the	  
price	  differences	  of	  similar	  units	  in	  development	  projects	  B	  and	  C	  that	  are	  sold	  in	  month	  3

assuming	  that	  the	  change	  in	  prices	  from	  January	  to	  March	  2003	  is	  likely	  to	  be	  small.	  If	  a	  city	  has	  no	  record	  in	  any	  
month	  in	  the	  first	  quarter	  of	  2003,	  we	  do	  not	  construct	  a	  price	  index.

 	  Our	  method	  of	  constructing	  housing	  price	  indices	  is	  related	  to	  the	  pseudo-­‐repeated	  sales	  price	  index	  recently	  
proposed	  by	  Guo,	  Zheng,	  Geltner,	  and	  Liu	  (2014).	  They	  also	  recognize	  that	  multiple	  apartments	  sold	  by	  a	  
development	  project	  over	  a	  period	  of	  time	  can	  be	  used	  to	  construct	  matching	  pairs	  that	  are	  simply	  pairs	  of	  units	  
within	  a	  matching	  space	  (say,	  building	  or	  a	  development	  project)	  sold	  at	  different	  points	  in	  time.	  They	  implement	  
their	  price	  index	  using	  data	  of	  new	  residential	  transactions	  in	  Chengdu.	  The	  main	  difference	  between	  their	  method	  
and	  ours	  lies	  in	  the	  regression	  specifications.	  In	  their	  specification,	  each	  unit	  may	  appear	  multiple	  times	  in	  the	  
regression	  depending	  on	  the	  number	  of	  times	  it	  is	  included	  in	  matching	  pairs.	  This	  may	  create	  a	  complicated	  
variance-­‐covariance	  structure	  for	  regression	  noise.	  In	  contrast,	  in	  our	  specification,	  each	  unit	  appears	  exactly	  once.

two	  months	  are	  uniform	  across	  development	  projects	  that	  may	  be	  located	  in	  different	  parts	  of	  
the	  city.9	  	  To	  see	  this,	  note	  from	  Figure	  3	  when	  we	  estimate	  the	  price	  change	  from	  month	  3	  to	  
month	  4,	  we	  pool	  the	  units	  sold	  in	  development	  projects	  C	  and	  D	  in	  the	  two	  months	  in	  the	  
regression;	  since	  we	  restrict	  the	  time	  dummy	  not	  to	  interact	  with	  the	  development	  projects,	  we	  
implicitly	  assume	  that	  the	  price	  changes	  in	  development	  projects	  C	  and	  D	  from	  month	  3	  to	  
month	  4	  are	  the	  same.	  Second,	  we	  also	  implicitly	  assume	  that	  the	  only	  source	  of	  price	  changes	  
between	  any	  two	  months	  in	  a	  development	  project	  is	  the	  overall	  change	  in	  the	  housing	  market	  
in	  the	  city.	  In	  particular,	  we	  assume	  that	  developers	  do	  not	  change	  their	  pricing	  strategies	  as	  
new	  units	  go	  on	  the	  market.10	  	  One	  may	  also	  be	  concerned	  that	  over	  time,	  the	  amenities	  and	  
infrastructure	  around	  the	  development	  projects	  may	  improve	  and	  thus	  part	  of	  the	  price	  
differences	  for	  units	  in	  the	  same	  development	  project	  sold	  in	  different	  months	  may	  reflect	  such	  
differences,	  not	  the	  housing	  market	  conditions.	  We	  believe	  that	  this	  is	  less	  likely	  an	  issue	  in	  
China,	  as	  buyers	  of	  earlier	  units	  are	  almost	  certainly	  aware	  of	  upcoming	  improvements	  in	  the	  
infrastructure	  (e.g.	  subway	  stations,	  shopping	  malls,	  etc.)	  close	  to	  the	  development	  projects,	  as	  
such	  projects	  are	  public	  information	  and	  developers	  surely	  advertise	  them	  to	  earlier	  buyers.

                             We	  use	  the	  method	  outlined	  in	  the	  previous	  section	  and	  a	  detailed	  mortgage	  data	  set	  to	  
construct	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  120	  major	  cities	  in	  China.	  The	  list	  of	  these	  cities	  is	  given	  in	  
Appendix	  B.	  Our	  mortgage	  data	  is	  compiled	  from	  mortgage	  contracts	  provided	  by	  a	  large	  
commercial	  bank,	  which	  accounts	  for	  about	  15	  percent	  of	  the	  mortgage	  loan	  market	  in	  China.	  	  
We	  restrict	  the	  sample	  to	  mortgages	  for	  new,	  residential	  properties	  and	  as	  a	  result	  have	  over

 	  This	  assumption	  in	  principle	  can	  be	  relaxed.	  If	  each	  month	  we	  have	  a	  sufficiently	  large	  number	  of	  sales	  located	  in	  
each	  district	  of	  a	  city,	  we	  can	  implement	  our	  regression	  at	  the	  district	  level	  and	  construct	  district-­‐specific	  price	  
indices.	  As	  a	  robustness	  check,	  we	  have	  divided	  Beijing	  into	  inner	  region	  that	  is	  close	  to	  the	  town	  center	  and	  
suburban	  area	  and	  constructed	  separate	  indices	  for	  the	  two	  areas.	  The	  monthly	  changes	  of	  these	  two	  indices	  are	  
highly	  correlated	  with	  a	  correlation	  of	  0.93,	  although	  the	  index	  for	  the	  inner	  region	  grew	  slightly	  faster	  than	  that	  
for	  the	  suburban	  area	  during	  our	  sample	  period.

     	  	  It	  is	  not	  clear	  how	  developers	  would	  change	  their	  pricing	  strategies	  during	  the	  course	  of	  sales	  of	  units	  in	  a	  
project.	  Wu,	  Deng,	  and	  Liu	  (2014)	  provide	  some	  evidence	  from	  hedonic	  regressions	  that	  the	  unit	  prices	  tend	  to	  
lower	  when	  the	  percentage	  of	  units	  in	  the	  projects	  already	  sold	  is	  higher.	  However,	  as	  they	  admitted,	  this	  does	  not	  
necessarily	  imply	  that	  developers	  are	  using	  different	  pricing	  policies	  for	  units	  that	  go	  on	  the	  market	  in	  different	  
months.

one	  million	  mortgage	  loan	  contracts	  dating	  from	  the	  first	  quarter	  of	  2003	  to	  the	  first	  quarter	  of	  
2013.	  A	  typical	  mortgage	  contract	  contains	  detailed	  information	  on	  the	  personal	  characteristics	  
of	  home	  buyers	  (e.g.,	  age,	  gender,	  marital	  status,	  income,	  work	  unit,	  education,	  occupation,	  
and	  region	  and	  address	  of	  residence),	  housing	  price	  and	  size,	  apartment-­‐level	  characteristics	  
(e.g.,	  complex	  location,	  floor	  level,	  and	  room	  number),	  as	  well	  as	  loan-­‐level	  characteristics	  (e.g.,	  
maturity	  and	  down-­‐payment).	  

                                                                 [Figure	  4	  about	  Here]	  

        Based	  on	  the	  transacted	  home	  prices	  and	  characteristics,	  we	  build	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  
120	  cities	  in	  China	  from	  2003-­‐2013.	  As	  our	  price	  indices	  are	  nominal,	  it	  is	  useful	  to	  keep	  in	  mind	  
that	  inflation	  was	  modest	  during	  that	  decade.	  Figure	  4	  depicts	  the	  national	  inflation	  together	  
with	  bank	  deposit	  rate.	  The	  national	  inflation	  fluctuated	  substantially	  from	  low	  levels	  around	  2	  
percent	  in	  2003-­‐2007	  to	  a	  peak	  level	  of	  8	  percent	  in	  early	  2008,	  only	  to	  quickly	  drop	  to	  below	  -­‐
1.5	  percent	  in	  the	  first	  half	  of	  2009,	  rising	  to	  around	  5	  percent	  in	  2011	  and	  eventually	  returning	  
to	  a	  level	  around	  2	  percent	  in	  2013.	  	  Inflation	  had	  a	  modest	  average	  rate	  of	  2.68	  percent	  during	  
our	  sample	  period.	  Figure	  4	  also	  shows	  that	  the	  bank	  deposit	  rate	  stayed	  in	  a	  narrow	  range	  
between	  2	  and	  4	  percent	  during	  this	  period.	  	  	  

        Our	  housing	  price	  indices	  allow	  us	  to	  precisely	  characterize	  the	  housing	  market	  boom	  in	  the	  
last	  decade	  throughout	  China.	  We	  describe	  the	  housing	  market	  boom	  below	  by	  tiers	  of	  cities.	  	  	  	  	  

A. First-­‐Tier	  Cities	  

                                                                 [Figure	  5	  about	  Here]	  

        Figure	  5	  depicts	  the	  monthly	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  the	  four	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  in	  four	  
separate	  panels,	  together	  with	  measures	  of	  households’	  purchasing	  power.	  In	  Panel	  A,	  the	  
housing	  price	  index	  of	  Beijing	  experienced	  an	  enormous	  rise	  from	  an	  index	  level	  of	  1	  in	  January	  
2003	  to	  7.6	  in	  March	  2013.	  That	  is,	  the	  housing	  price	  level	  has	  increased	  660%	  in	  a	  short	  period	  
of	  ten	  years!	  	  	  

       During	  this	  period,	  Beijing’s	  housing	  prices	  have	  actually	  experienced	  at	  least	  two	  episodes	  

                                                                                                                                                            14	  
	  
of	  downward	  movement.	  The	  first	  episode	  started	  in	  May	  2008,	  when	  the	  price	  index	  was	  at	  
3.50	  (relative	  to	  January	  2003),	  and	  continued	  until	  March	  2009,	  when	  the	  price	  index	  slid	  to	  
3.05.	  This	  represented	  a	  13%	  price	  drop	  and	  coincided	  with	  the	  global	  financial	  crisis.	  The	  
second	  episode	  is	  more	  recent.	  It	  began	  in	  May	  2011	  and	  ended	  in	  June	  2012	  when	  the	  housing	  
price	  index	  fluctuated	  between	  the	  interval	  of	  5.99	  and	  6.67.	  	  

       As	  benchmarks	  for	  the	  housing	  price	  appreciation,	  Panel	  A	  also	  plots	  two	  measures	  of	  the	  
households’	  purchasing	  power	  in	  Beijing:	  per	  capita	  Gross	  Regional	  Product	  (GRP)	  and	  
disposable	  income	  (urban)	  during	  the	  same	  period.	  The	  per	  capita	  GRP	  measures	  the	  per	  capita	  
value	  of	  output	  in	  the	  whole	  city	  and	  the	  per	  capita	  disposable	  income	  (urban)	  measures	  the	  
per	  capita	  income	  received	  by	  urban	  residents	  of	  the	  city.	  Both	  of	  these	  measures	  have	  
experienced	  similar	  growth	  from	  1	  in	  2003	  to	  a	  level	  around	  3	  in	  2013.	  While	  this	  growth	  is	  
remarkable	  by	  any	  standard,	  it	  is	  nevertheless	  substantially	  smaller	  than	  the	  housing	  price	  
appreciation	  in	  the	  city.	  	  	  

       Panel	  B	  plots	  the	  monthly	  housing	  price	  index	  for	  Shanghai.	  The	  index	  increased	  from	  1	  in	  
January	  2003	  to	  about	  4.43	  in	  March	  2013.	  The	  overall	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  Shanghai	  	  
was	  more	  modest	  than	  that	  in	  Beijing,	  even	  though	  Shanghai’s	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  
actually	  started	  faster	  than	  Beijing.	  Shanghai’s	  housing	  prices	  doubled	  by	  April	  2005	  relative	  to	  
that	  in	  January	  2003,	  while	  Beijing’s	  housing	  prices	  did	  not	  double	  until	  August	  2006.	  However,	  
Shanghai	  experienced	  three	  episodes	  of	  price	  adjustment	  in	  the	  last	  decade.	  The	  first	  
adjustment	  started	  in	  May	  2005	  when	  the	  index	  was	  at	  2.05,	  and	  ended	  in	  March	  2007	  when	  
the	  index	  went	  down	  to	  as	  low	  as	  1.79.	  This	  represented	  a	  13%	  price	  correction.	  However,	  the	  
housing	  prices	  picked	  up	  again	  from	  March	  2007	  to	  reach	  an	  index	  level	  of	  2.72	  in	  August	  2008.	  
The	  second	  episode	  was	  a	  swift	  and	  small	  adjustment	  with	  the	  index	  dropping	  from	  2.72	  in	  
August	  2008	  to	  2.41	  in	  December	  2008.	  The	  third	  episode	  started	  in	  June	  2011	  with	  the	  price	  
index	  dropping	  from	  4.27	  to	  as	  low	  as	  3.20	  in	  March	  2012.	  This	  represented	  a	  25%	  price	  
correction.	  However,	  housing	  prices	  picked	  up	  again	  from	  March	  2012.	  By	  March	  2013,	  the	  
price	  index	  reached	  its	  peak	  at	  4.43.	  	  

       The	  growth	  of	  households’	  disposable	  income	  in	  Shanghai	  during	  this	  period	  was	  about	  the	  

                                                                                                                                                     15	  
	  
same	  as	  that	  in	  Beijing,	  with	  disposable	  income	  of	  urban	  residents	  roughly	  tripling	  from	  January	  
2003	  to	  March	  2013.	  Thus,	  the	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  Shanghai,	  while	  quite	  substantial,	  
is	  nonetheless	  much	  more	  closely	  aligned	  with	  the	  growth	  of	  disposable	  income.	  The	  other	  
measure	  of	  purchasing	  power,	  GRP	  per	  capita,	  exhibits	  more	  modest	  growth	  in	  Shanghai,	  but	  it	  
still	  more	  than	  doubled	  in	  this	  period.	  

       Panels	  C	  and	  D	  respectively	  plot	  the	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  Guangzhou	  and	  Shenzhen.	  The	  
overall	  picture	  of	  these	  two	  cities	  in	  Guangdong	  Province	  (near	  Hong	  Kong)	  is	  similar.	  
Guangzhou’s	  price	  index	  increased	  from	  1	  in	  January	  2003	  to	  5.1	  in	  March	  2013,	  while	  it	  rose	  
from	  1	  to	  3.65	  in	  Shenzhen	  during	  the	  same	  period.	  Both	  cities	  experienced	  multiple	  episodes	  
of	  price	  adjustment.	  The	  most	  severe	  price	  adjustment	  occurred	  in	  Shenzhen,	  starting	  in	  
October	  2007	  when	  its	  price	  index	  was	  at	  2.97	  and	  reaching	  a	  trough	  in	  January	  2009	  when	  the	  
index	  was	  at	  1.82.	  This	  represented	  a	  39%	  price	  correction.	  At	  almost	  the	  same	  time,	  from	  
November	  2007,	  Guangzhou’s	  housing	  prices	  also	  started	  dropping	  from	  an	  index	  level	  of	  3.08,	  
and	  reached	  a	  trough	  of	  2.38	  in	  February	  2009.	  This	  represented	  a	  23%	  price	  correction.	  Both	  
Guangzhou	  and	  Shenzhen	  are	  located	  in	  the	  Pearl	  River	  delta,	  the	  world’s	  largest	  
manufacturing	  export	  center.	  	  The	  housing	  price	  drops	  in	  these	  two	  cities	  were	  clearly	  related	  
to	  the	  global	  economic	  crisis.	  The	  fact	  that	  our	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  the	  two	  cities	  are	  able	  
to	  capture	  these	  crisis-­‐induced	  price-­‐adjustment	  episodes	  lends	  credence	  to	  them.	  

       Panels	  C	  and	  D	  also	  reveal	  that	  the	  per	  capita	  disposable	  income	  in	  Guangzhou	  nearly	  
tripled	  during	  the	  same	  period,	  while	  in	  Shenzhen	  grew	  by	  only	  68	  percent.	  Shenzhen’s	  per	  
capita	  disposable	  income	  growth	  was	  much	  smaller	  than	  the	  growth	  of	  the	  per	  capita	  GRP,	  
perhaps	  because	  Shenzhen	  had	  millions	  of	  migrant	  workers,	  whose	  outputs	  were	  included	  in	  
the	  calculation	  of	  the	  GRP,	  but	  not	  the	  per	  capita	  disposable	  income	  for	  urban	  residents	  with	  
Hukou	  (i.e.,	  the	  official	  city	  residence	  registration).

January	  2003	  through	  March	  2013,	  as	  well	  as	  for	  sub-­‐periods	  from	  January	  2003	  through	  
December	  2007	  and	  from	  January	  2009	  through	  March	  2013.	  We	  exclude	  2008	  between	  the	  
two	  sub-­‐periods	  to	  isolate	  the	  potential	  crisis	  effects.	  Panel	  A	  reports	  these	  statistics	  in	  nominal	  
values,	  and	  Panel	  B	  reports	  them	  in	  real	  values,	  after	  adjusting	  for	  the	  national	  inflation	  rate.	  

       To	  aggregate	  the	  price	  indices	  for	  the	  four	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  we	  construct	  a	  price	  index	  for	  the	  
tier	  by	  setting	  the	  initial	  index	  level	  of	  each	  city	  to	  be	  one	  at	  the	  beginning	  of	  a	  given	  period	  and	  
then	  taking	  an	  equal	  weighted	  average	  of	  the	  index	  levels	  of	  these	  cities	  for	  each	  subsequent	  
month.	  The	  resulting	  index	  level	  represents	  the	  value	  of	  a	  housing	  portfolio	  constructed	  from	  
investing	  one	  RMB	  into	  the	  housing	  index	  of	  each	  city	  in	  the	  first	  month	  and	  keeping	  the	  
portfolio	  composition	  throughout	  the	  subsequent	  months.	  We	  also	  use	  the	  same	  method	  to	  
construct	  indices	  for	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities.	  	  

       Among	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  Panel	  A	  shows	  that	  the	  nominal	  housing	  price	  index	  had	  an	  average	  
annual	  return	  of	  21%	  from	  January	  2003	  to	  December	  2007.	  Housing	  prices	  dropped	  in	  2008.	  
After	  January	  2009,	  the	  housing	  price	  index	  continued	  to	  rise,	  and	  on	  average	  had	  another	  
staggering	  average	  annual	  return	  of	  17.7%	  from	  January	  2009	  to	  March	  2013.	  Over	  the	  whole	  
10-­‐year	  period	  from	  January	  2003	  to	  March	  2013,	  the	  housing	  price	  index	  for	  the	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  
had	  an	  average	  return	  of	  15.9%!	  	  

       Panel	  A	  also	  reports	  the	  nominal	  growth	  of	  two	  measures	  of	  “purchasing	  power”:	  per	  capita	  
GRP	  and	  disposable	  income.	  Both	  measures	  have	  increased	  significantly	  in	  the	  decade,	  on	  
average	  by	  9.4%	  and	  9.3%	  from	  January	  2003	  to	  March	  2013.	  But	  the	  housing	  price	  
appreciation	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  was	  nearly	  twice	  the	  magnitudes	  of	  the	  increases	  in	  the	  two	  
measures	  of	  purchasing	  power.	  

       In	  real	  values,	  Panel	  B	  shows	  that	  the	  housing	  return	  for	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  averaged	  13.1%	  per	  
annum,	  and	  the	  two	  measures	  of	  purchasing	  power	  grew	  on	  average	  by	  6.7%	  and	  6.6%	  per	  
year.

B. Second-­‐	  and	  Third-­‐Tier	  Cities	  

                                                                [Figure	  6	  about	  Here]	  

       Due	  to	  the	  large	  number	  of	  cities	  in	  second	  and	  third	  tiers,	  we	  cannot	  separately	  plot	  the	  
housing	  price	  index	  for	  each	  city.	  Instead,	  we	  depict	  the	  price	  index	  for	  each	  of	  the	  tiers,	  
together	  with	  measures	  of	  purchasing	  power	  in	  Figure	  6.	  	  	  

       In	  panel	  A	  of	  Figure	  6,	  the	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  second-­‐tier	  cities	  is	  substantial,	  
though	  not	  as	  breathtaking	  as	  that	  in	  the	  first	  tier	  cities.	  Overall,	  the	  price	  index	  rose	  from	  the	  
base	  of	  1	  in	  January	  2003	  to	  3.92	  in	  March	  2013.	  The	  price	  fluctuations	  are	  also	  more	  modest	  
compared	  to	  those	  experienced	  in	  the	  individual	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  though	  part	  of	  the	  moderation	  
in	  price	  fluctuation	  is	  the	  result	  of	  averaging	  over	  31	  second-­‐tier	  cities.	  	  

       A	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  of	  292%	  in	  ten	  years	  is	  remarkable	  by	  any	  standard.	  It	  is	  larger	  
than	  the	  magnitude	  of	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  during	  the	  U.S.	  housing	  bubble	  in	  2000s	  and	  
is	  comparable	  to	  the	  price	  appreciation	  during	  the	  Japanese	  housing	  bubble	  in	  1980s.	  However,	  
what	  is	  more	  surprising	  in	  Panel	  A	  is	  that	  the	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  second	  tier	  cities	  is	  
very	  much	  in	  accordance	  to	  the	  growth	  in	  measures	  of	  purchasing	  power.	  To	  the	  extent	  we	  
believe	  that	  income	  growth,	  or	  growth	  in	  GRP,	  represents	  fundamental	  demand	  of	  households	  
for	  housing,	  the	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  the	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  though	  enormous,	  
nonetheless	  does	  not	  appear	  to	  have	  significantly	  deviated	  from	  the	  increases	  in	  households’	  
purchasing	  power.	  

       Table	  1	  reports	  summary	  statistics	  for	  the	  31	  second-­‐tier	  cities	  in	  our	  sample.	  	  During	  the	  
decade	  from	  2003	  to	  2013,	  the	  second-­‐tier	  cities	  on	  average	  witnessed	  an	  average	  annual	  
housing	  return	  of	  13.2%	  in	  nominal	  values	  and	  10.5%	  in	  real	  values.	  	  In	  the	  same	  decade,	  per	  
capita	  GRP	  had	  an	  average	  annual	  growth	  rate	  of	  13.4%	  in	  nominal	  values,	  fully	  comparable	  to	  
the	  housing	  return.	  The	  average	  annual	  growth	  rate	  of	  per	  capita	  disposable	  income	  for	  urban	  
residents	  was	  11.7%	  in	  nominal	  values,	  which	  was	  only	  slightly	  smaller	  than	  the	  housing	  return.	  

       In	  nominal	  values,	  housing	  prices	  in	  the	  second-­‐tier	  cities	  grew	  on	  average	  by	  16.8%	  per	  


                                                                                                                                                         18	  
	  
year	  from	  January	  2003	  to	  December	  2007,	  while	  the	  increase	  was	  11.6%	  from	  January	  2009	  to	  
March	  2013.	  The	  increases	  in	  housing	  prices	  in	  these	  two	  sub-­‐periods	  are	  again	  commensurate	  
with	  the	  corresponding	  increases	  in	  purchasing	  power,	  measured	  by	  either	  per	  capita	  GRP	  or	  
disposable	  income.	  

                                                                   [Figure	  7	  about	  Here]	  

       There	  are	  substantial	  variations	  among	  the	  cities.	  Figure	  7	  depicts	  the	  logarithmic	  nominal	  
housing	  price	  appreciation	  for	  each	  city	  in	  our	  sample	  from	  January	  2003	  to	  March	  2013,	  i.e.	  
       !
ln  (!!"#$ ).	  Panel	  A	  collects	  all	  cities	  in	  first	  and	  second	  tiers	  and	  Panel	  B	  collects	  cities	  in	  the	  
        !""#

third	  tier.	  We	  choose	  logarithmic	  price	  appreciation	  so	  that	  we	  can	  further	  break	  down	  the	  
price	  appreciation	  of	  each	  city	  into	  two	  parts,	  one	  in	  2003-­‐2007	  and	  the	  other	  in	  2008-­‐2013.	  
Among	  the	  first-­‐	  and	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  Beijing	  had	  the	  largest	  price	  appreciation	  in	  2003-­‐2013,	  
followed	  by	  Wenzhou	  (a	  coastal	  city	  of	  Zhejiang	  Province	  known	  for	  its	  vibrant	  manufacturing	  
sector)	  and	  Nanjing	  (the	  capital	  city	  of	  Jiangsu	  Province).	  Yinchuan	  (the	  capital	  city	  of	  Ningxia	  
Province	  in	  Northwestern	  China)	  had	  the	  lowest	  price	  appreciation	  that	  nevertheless	  amounted	  
to	  over	  120%	  during	  this	  period,	  which	  came	  mostly	  from	  the	  second	  half	  of	  the	  period.	  	  

       We	  now	  examine	  the	  price	  appreciation	  in	  third-­‐tier	  cities.	  Panel	  B	  of	  Figure	  6	  depicts	  the	  
aggregate	  price	  index	  and	  measures	  of	  purchasing	  power	  for	  the	  85	  third	  tier	  cities	  in	  our	  
sample.	  A	  remarkable	  feature	  of	  the	  plot	  is	  that	  despite	  the	  enormous	  housing	  price	  
appreciation	  in	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  during	  the	  decade,	  the	  housing	  price	  increase	  actually	  lagged	  the	  
growth	  of	  disposable	  income.	  The	  housing	  price	  index	  slightly	  more	  than	  tripled,	  increasing	  
from	  the	  base	  of	  1	  in	  January	  2003	  to	  3.13	  in	  March	  2013.	  According	  to	  Table	  1,	  the	  housing	  
price	  index	  had	  an	  average	  return	  of	  10.6%	  per	  year	  in	  nominal	  values	  or	  7.9%	  in	  real	  values.	  
Again	  there	  is	  substantial	  heterogeneity	  across	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  as	  shown	  in	  Panel	  B	  of	  Figure	  7,	  
with	  the	  price	  appreciation	  ranging	  from	  0.1	  to	  1.8	  in	  log	  scale	  (or	  10%	  to	  500%	  in	  percentage	  
returns)	  in	  2003-­‐2013.	  While	  the	  price	  appreciation	  is	  positive	  across	  all	  cities	  in	  the	  full	  period,	  
several	  of	  them,	  such	  as	  Lianyungang	  and	  Huangshan,	  had	  substantial	  price	  drops	  in	  2003-­‐2007	  
and	  recovered	  the	  drops	  in	  2008-­‐2013.	  	  	  


                                                                                                                                                                19	  
	  
                             The	  tripling	  of	  the	  housing	  index	  of	  the	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  is	  actually	  below	  the	  growth	  of	  the	  
two	  measures	  of	  purchasing	  power	  in	  these	  cities	  in	  the	  same	  period.	  According	  to	  Table	  1,	  per	  
capita	  GRP	  grew	  on	  average	  by	  15.0%	  per	  year	  in	  nominal	  values	  during	  this	  decade,	  while	  per	  
capita	  disposable	  income	  for	  urban	  residents	  grew	  on	  average	  by	  11.7%	  per	  year.	  This	  pattern,	  
namely,	  enormous	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  but	  nonetheless	  below	  the	  increases	  in	  measures	  
of	  purchasing	  power,	  also	  holds	  in	  the	  two	  sub-­‐periods.	  

                             Overall,	  housing	  prices	  across	  Chinese	  cities	  experienced	  tremendous	  growth	  between	  2003	  
and	  2013.	  The	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  was	  particularly	  dramatic	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  rising	  over	  
five	  fold	  in	  2003-­‐2013	  and	  substantially	  outpacing	  the	  growth	  of	  household	  purchasing	  power.	  
The	  price	  appreciation	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  while	  remarkable,	  was	  matched	  by	  
equally	  impressive	  growth	  in	  household	  purchasing	  power	  during	  the	  same	  period.

                             Micro-­‐based,	  constant	  quality	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  Chinese	  cities	  are	  not	  yet	  widely	  
available.	  The	  National	  Bureau	  of	  Statistics	  (NBS)	  of	  China	  reports	  two	  widely	  used	  official	  
housing	  price	  series.	  	  These	  two	  series	  are	  commonly	  known	  as	  the	  "NBS	  70-­‐city	  index"	  and	  the	  
"NBS	  Average	  Price	  Index."11	  

                             NBS	  70-­‐City	  Index.	  	  The	  NBS	  started	  to	  construct	  quarterly	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  35	  
large-­‐	  and	  medium-­‐size	  cities	  in	  1997.	  Then,	  it	  expanded	  the	  list	  to	  70	  cities	  and	  replaced	  
quarterly	  indices	  to	  monthly	  ones	  beginning	  in	  July	  2005.	  In	  the	  construction	  of	  the	  "NBS	  70-­‐
City	  Index,"	  technicians	  from	  local	  statistics	  authorities	  are	  sent	  in	  each	  month	  to	  sample	  
housing	  complexes	  and	  collect	  raw	  information	  on	  housing	  transaction	  prices.	  For	  each	  housing	  
complex	  sampled	  by	  the	  local	  statistics	  authorities,	  the	  average	  transaction	  price	  is	  calculated	  in	  
each	  month	  and	  compared	  with	  that	  of	  the	  same	  complex	  in	  the	  previous	  month.	  The	  monthly

in	  35	  major	  cities,	  from	  which	  average	  prices	  can	  be	  calculated	  by	  simply	  dividing	  the	  total	  price	  
paid	  by	  total	  floor	  area	  of	  the	  transacted	  units	  in	  a	  given	  month	  and	  given	  city.	  	  

                             As	  pointed	  out	  in	  Deng,	  Gyourko,	  and	  Wu	  (2014b),	  both	  official	  series	  have	  well-­‐known	  
issues	  and	  have	  been	  widely	  criticized:	  the	  NBS	  70-­‐City	  Index	  is	  remarkably	  smooth	  and	  shows	  
very	  little	  real	  housing	  price	  growth	  in	  70	  Chinese	  cities	  in	  the	  last	  decade,	  while	  the	  NBS	  
Average	  Price	  Index	  fails	  to	  control	  for	  quality,	  as	  it	  does	  not	  account	  for	  the	  fact	  that	  the	  newly	  
transacted	  units	  in	  a	  given	  city	  are	  gradually	  moving	  to	  the	  outer-­‐rings	  of	  the	  city,	  an	  important	  
feature	  in	  rapidly	  expanding	  Chinese	  cities.	  	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [Figure	  8	  about	  Here]	  

                             Figure	  8	  depicts	  our	  housing	  price	  index	  against	  the	  two	  official	  series	  for	  the	  four	  first-­‐tier	  
cities.	  Indeed,	  the	  NBS	  70-­‐City	  Index	  shows	  little	  variation	  in	  housing	  prices	  during	  the	  decade	  
and	  is	  thus	  in	  sharp	  contrast	  to	  common	  experiences	  in	  these	  cities.	  Interestingly,	  the	  NBS	  
Average	  Price	  Index	  exhibits	  highly	  synchronized	  co-­‐movements	  with	  our	  index	  across	  all	  four	  
cities.	  Such	  co-­‐movements	  are	  re-­‐assuring	  as	  they	  indicate	  that	  our	  index	  is	  capturing	  similar	  
fluctuations	  as	  the	  straightforward	  calculation	  of	  average	  transaction	  prices.	  It	  is	  also	  useful	  to	  
note	  that	  the	  NBS	  Average	  Price	  Index	  shows	  smaller	  price	  appreciation	  than	  our	  index	  across	  
three	  of	  the	  four	  cities,	  which	  is	  consistent	  with	  the	  argument	  that	  the	  average	  price	  index	  does	  
not	  account	  for	  the	  gradual	  shift	  in	  the	  location	  of	  the	  transacted	  housing	  units.	  	  	  	  

                             Wu,	  Deng,	  and	  Liu	  (2014)	  have	  made	  a	  notable	  attempt	  to	  construct	  micro-­‐based,	  constant	  
quality	  housing	  price	  indices	  for	  35	  Chinese	  cities	  by	  using	  data	  from	  the	  so-­‐called	  “Real	  Estate

method,	  though	  there	  are	  some	  differences	  in	  detail:	  	  we	  include	  all	  development	  projects	  for	  sale,	  while	  the	  NBS	  
includes	  only	  those	  sampled	  housing	  complexes;	  we	  control	  for	  a	  list	  of	  unit	  level	  characteristics,	  while	  the	  NBS	  
obtains	  the	  complex	  level	  monthly	  price	  by	  dividing	  total	  sales	  revenue	  in	  the	  complex	  over	  the	  total	  areas.

which	  was	  the	  period	  of	  Japan's	  rapid	  economic	  growth.	  	  Instead,	  Panel	  A	  of	  Figure	  9	  depicts	  an	  
index	  of	  urban	  land	  price	  provided	  by	  the	  Japan	  Real	  Estate	  Institute,	  from	  1955	  to	  2014,	  
together	  with	  the	  per	  capita	  GDP	  of	  Japan.	  Both	  series	  are	  in	  nominal	  values	  and	  are

which	  they	  refer	  to	  as	  the	  “Chinese	  Residential	  Land	  Price	  Index,”	  based	  on	  similar	  hedonic	  regressions,	  using	  sales	  
prices	  of	  leasehold	  estates	  to	  private	  developers	  for	  35	  major	  Chinese	  cities.	  Their	  land	  price	  index	  showed	  
extremely	  high	  real	  land	  price	  growth	  across	  these	  cities,	  much	  more	  so	  and	  with	  much	  more	  cross-­‐city	  variations	  
than	  the	  “China	  Urban	  Land	  Price	  Dynamic	  Monitor”	  system	  provided	  by	  the	  Ministry	  of	  Land	  and	  Resources	  of

the	  past	  25	  years.	  During	  this	  period,	  the	  urban	  land	  price	  index	  continued	  to	  fall	  by	  half	  and	  
eventually	  converged	  back	  to	  the	  same	  level	  of	  the	  per	  capita	  GDP	  in	  2014.	  The	  dramatic	  
divergence	  of	  the	  land	  price	  index	  from	  the	  per	  capita	  GDP	  before	  1990	  and	  the	  subsequent	  
convergence	  vividly	  illustrates	  the	  widely	  recognized	  Japanese	  housing	  bubble.	  Based	  on	  our	  
earlier	  discussion,	  the	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  across	  Chinese	  cities	  during	  2003-­‐2013	  was	  
rather	  different	  from	  the	  experience	  of	  the	  Japanese	  housing	  bubble.	  Except	  the	  few	  first-­‐tier	  
cities,	  the	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  the	  large	  number	  of	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  was	  
largely	  in	  line	  with	  the	  growth	  of	  household	  purchasing	  power.	  	  

       Panel	  B	  of	  Figure	  9	  depicts	  the	  private	  property	  resale	  price	  index	  for	  Singapore,	  which	  is

GDP	  of	  Singapore,	  from	  1975	  to	  2010.	  Both	  series	  are	  in	  nominal	  values	  and	  are	  normalized	  to	  1	  
in	  1975.	  During	  this	  period,	  the	  per	  capita	  GDP	  grew	  from	  a	  level	  of	  1	  to	  slightly	  over	  10,	  
representing	  an	  average	  growth	  rate	  of	  6.6%	  per	  year.	  Interestingly,	  the	  housing	  price	  index	  
also	  grew	  from	  1	  to	  about	  11,	  roughly	  in	  line	  with	  the	  GDP	  growth.	  While	  the	  housing	  price

housing	  price	  index	  did	  diverge	  substantially	  from	  the	  GDP	  in	  two	  episodes,	  one	  in	  the	  early	  
1980s	  and	  the	  other	  in	  1995-­‐1997,	  right	  before	  the	  Asian	  financial	  crisis.	  Both	  episodes	  
happened	  after	  a	  long	  period	  of	  steady	  economic	  growth,	  during	  which	  the	  housing	  price	  index	  
rapidly	  appreciated	  in	  a	  few	  years,	  significantly	  outpacing	  GDP	  growth.	  When	  the	  GDP	  growth	  
slowed,	  the	  housing	  price	  index	  collapsed	  and	  returned	  to	  the	  level	  in	  line	  with	  the	  GDP	  in	  a	  few	  
years.	  	  These	  price	  corrections	  appear	  very	  relevant	  for	  thinking	  about	  potential	  risk	  in	  the	  
Chinese	  housing	  market,	  especially	  in	  the	  first-­‐tier	  cities.	  	  	  	  	  	  	  


                                                                 4. Mortgage	  Borrowers	  

       It	  is	  possible	  to	  explain	  the	  dramatic	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  by	  the	  
limited	  housing	  supplies	  in	  these	  over-­‐crowded	  metropolitan	  areas.	  As	  discussed	  in	  Section	  1,	  
the	  total	  area	  of	  newly	  completed	  residential	  housing	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  has	  substantially	  slowed	  
since	  2005,	  while	  that	  of	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  has	  been	  steadily	  growing.	  	  However,	  


                                                                                                                                                         23	  
	  
supply	  is	  not	  the	  only	  factor	  that	  matters	  to	  housing	  markets.	  As	  the	  rising	  housing	  prices	  
directly	  impact	  every	  household	  in	  the	  cities,	  it	  is	  important	  to	  fully	  understand	  the	  financial	  
burdens	  faced	  by	  home	  buyers,	  especially	  low-­‐income	  home	  buyers.	  

       Our	  detailed	  mortgage	  data	  allow	  us	  to	  provide	  a	  comprehensive	  picture	  of	  mortgage	  
borrowers	  in	  different	  cities,	  who	  take	  loans	  to	  buy	  homes.	  In	  this	  section,	  we	  summarize	  a	  set	  
of	  characteristics	  of	  these	  mortgage	  borrowers,	  including	  household	  income,	  down	  payment,	  
price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio,	  home	  size,	  age,	  and	  marital	  status.	  In	  particular,	  we	  focus	  on	  discussing	  
the	  financial	  burdens	  faced	  by	  these	  mortgage	  borrowers.	  

       Note	  that	  households	  in	  the	  most	  wealthy	  fraction	  of	  the	  population	  may	  purchase	  homes	  
using	  cash	  and	  thus	  do	  not	  appear	  in	  our	  mortgage	  data.	  For	  this	  reason,	  our	  mortgage	  data	  is	  
particularly	  useful	  for	  analyzing	  the	  characteristics	  of	  relatively	  low-­‐income	  home	  buyers	  as	  
opposed	  to	  that	  of	  high-­‐income	  buyers.	  We	  focus	  on	  analyzing	  two	  sets	  of	  borrowers	  in	  each	  
tier	  of	  cities:	  The	  first	  set	  has	  household	  income	  in	  the	  bottom	  10%	  among	  all	  mortgage	  
borrowers	  in	  a	  given	  city	  and	  a	  given	  year.	  We	  refer	  to	  this	  set	  as	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  borrower	  
group.	  We	  also	  denote	  borrowers	  with	  income	  exactly	  at	  the	  10	  percentile	  of	  all	  borrowers	  by	  
p10.	  The	  second	  set	  has	  household	  income	  in	  the	  middle	  range,	  specifically	  within	  the	  45th	  and	  
55th	  percentile	  of	  all	  mortgage	  borrowers	  in	  a	  given	  city	  and	  a	  given	  year.	  We	  refer	  to	  this	  set	  
the	  middle-­‐income	  group	  and	  denote	  borrowers	  with	  exactly	  the	  median	  income	  of	  all	  
borrowers	  by	  p50.

2012,	  and	  the	  right	  plot	  shows	  the	  position	  of	  p10	  and	  p50	  in	  the	  income	  distribution	  of	  the	  city

(UHS).	  As	  income	  distribution	  is	  not	  available	  for	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  Panel	  C	  shows	  only	  the	  annual	  
income	  of	  p10	  and	  p50.	  	  

       Figure	  10	  shows	  steady	  growth	  in	  the	  household	  income	  of	  both	  p10	  and	  p50	  across	  the	  
three	  tiers	  of	  cities.	  In	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  the	  annual	  household	  income	  of	  p10	  grew	  from	  39,000	  
RMB	  in	  2003	  to	  92,000	  in	  2012	  while	  the	  income	  of	  p50	  grew	  from	  87,000	  in	  2003	  to	  184,000	  in	  
2012.	  In	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  the	  annual	  income	  of	  p10	  grew	  from	  19,000	  RMB	  in	  2003	  to	  58,000	  
in	  2012,	  while	  that	  of	  p50	  from	  40,000	  in	  2003	  to	  99,000	  in	  2012.	  In	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  the	  income	  
of	  p10	  grew	  from	  15,000	  to	  51,000,	  while	  that	  of	  p50	  grew	  from	  28,000	  to	  83,000.	  This	  
tremendous	  income	  growth	  of	  mortgage	  borrowers	  is	  largely	  consistent	  with	  the	  income	  
growth	  of	  the	  overall	  urban	  population	  we	  discussed	  above.	  

       For	  most	  of	  the	  first-­‐	  and	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  the	  UHS	  provides	  income	  distribution	  of	  urban	  
households.	  To	  specifically	  compare	  the	  income	  growth	  of	  mortgage	  borrowers	  with	  that	  of	  the	  
urban	  population,	  we	  mark	  the	  position	  of	  p10	  and	  p50	  in	  the	  population	  income	  distribution	  
reported	  by	  the	  UHS.	  As	  our	  data	  from	  the	  UHS	  cover	  only	  2003-­‐2009,	  we	  extrapolate	  the	  
income	  distribution	  in	  2009	  into	  the	  subsequent	  years	  based	  on	  the	  city’s	  average	  income	  
growth.	  	  

       The	  median-­‐income	  borrower	  p50	  came	  from	  the	  relatively	  wealthy	  fraction	  of	  the	  
population.	  In	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  p50	  declined	  from	  the	  85th	  percentile	  of	  the	  population	  in	  2003	  
to	  the	  59th	  percentile	  in	  2009	  and	  then	  climbed	  back	  to	  the	  75th	  percentile.	  In	  second-­‐tier	  
cities,	  p50	  declined	  from	  the	  81.5th	  percentile	  in	  2003	  to	  the	  62th	  percentile	  in	  2010	  and	  then	  
climbed	  back	  to	  the	  68th	  percentile	  in	  2012.	  	  

       The	  position	  of	  the	  low-­‐income	  mortgage	  borrower	  p10	  is	  particularly	  interesting.	  It	  
indicates	  the	  extent	  to	  which	  low-­‐income	  households	  in	  the	  population	  were	  participating	  in	  
the	  housing	  markets.	  Overall,	  p10	  was	  located	  at	  a	  position	  around	  the	  25th	  percentile	  of	  the	  
population	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  and	  around	  the	  30th	  percentile	  in	  second-­‐tier	  cities.	  These	  
positions	  indicate	  that	  mortgage	  borrowers	  were	  not	  just	  coming	  from	  the	  top-­‐income	  
households	  and	  instead	  were	  reasonably	  well	  represented	  in	  the	  low-­‐income	  fraction	  of	  the	  
population.	  	  	  

                                                                                                                                                           25	  
	  
        Interestingly,	  despite	  the	  rapid	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  p10	  steadily	  
declined	  from	  a	  position	  around	  the	  35th	  percentile	  in	  2003	  to	  the	  17.5th	  percentile	  in	  2010	  
before	  it	  climbed	  back	  to	  the	  26th	  percentile	  in	  2012.	  This	  suggests	  that	  the	  rapidly	  growing	  
prices	  in	  recent	  years	  have	  not	  prevented	  households	  from	  the	  low-­‐income	  fraction	  of	  the	  
population	  from	  buying	  homes.	  In	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  p10	  stayed	  in	  a	  range	  between	  the	  28th	  
and	  40th	  percentile-­‐-­‐-­‐it	  declined	  from	  a	  peak	  of	  the	  40th	  percentile	  in	  2005	  to	  the	  28.5th	  
percentile	  in	  2010	  and	  then	  climbed	  back	  to	  the	  35th	  percentile	  in	  2012.	  	  	  

        Taken	  together,	  Figure	  10	  shows	  steady	  increases	  in	  the	  household	  income	  of	  bottom-­‐	  and	  
middle-­‐income	  mortgage	  borrowers	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities.	  	  Furthermore,	  despite	  the	  
tremendous	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  in	  these	  cities,	  mortgage	  borrowers	  were	  well	  
represented	  in	  the	  population	  and	  the	  housing	  market	  participation	  of	  households	  from	  the	  
low-­‐income	  fraction	  of	  the	  population	  remained	  stable.	  	  	  

B. Down	  Payment	  

        Mortgage	  down	  payment	  is	  a	  key	  variable	  that	  determines	  the	  leverage	  used	  by	  mortgage	  
borrowers	  and	  serves	  as	  an	  equity	  buffer	  to	  prevent	  borrowers	  from	  defaulting	  on	  the	  loans	  in	  
the	  event	  of	  a	  future	  housing	  price	  meltdown.	  Figure	  11	  depicts	  the	  fraction	  of	  down	  payment	  
in	  the	  home	  value	  at	  the	  time	  of	  purchase,	  separately	  for	  the	  bottom-­‐	  and	  middle-­‐income	  
groups.	  	  

                                                              [Figure	  11	  about	  Here]	  

        The	  right	  panel	  shows	  that	  for	  mortgage	  borrowers	  in	  the	  middle-­‐income	  group,	  down	  
payment	  on	  average	  contributed	  to	  at	  least	  35%	  of	  home	  value	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities.	  
Interestingly,	  the	  left	  panel	  shows	  that	  for	  borrowers	  in	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  group,	  the	  fraction	  
of	  down	  payment	  was	  even	  higher-­‐-­‐-­‐it	  was	  consistently	  above	  38%	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  
cities.	  	  

        These	  high	  levels	  of	  down	  payment	  are	  consistent	  with	  the	  strict	  mortgage	  policies	  imposed	  
by	  the	  Chinese	  government	  on	  banks.	  Specifically,	  the	  policies	  restrict	  one	  housing	  unit	  from	  
being	  used	  as	  collateral	  for	  more	  than	  one	  mortgage	  loan.	  The	  policies	  also	  require	  a	  minimum	  

                                                                                                                                                    26	  
	  
down	  payment	  of	  30%	  on	  first	  mortgages.	  As	  detailed	  in	  Appendix	  A,	  this	  minimum	  down	  
payment	  requirement	  had	  changed	  over	  time	  between	  two	  levels:	  30%	  or	  40%.	  Banks	  have	  
requested	  even	  higher	  down	  payments	  on	  second	  mortgages	  that	  are	  used	  to	  finance	  
purchases	  of	  second	  homes.	  	  	  	  

                             The	  high	  levels	  of	  mortgage	  down	  payment	  used	  by	  Chinese	  borrowers	  were	  in	  sharp	  
contrast	  to	  the	  popular	  use	  of	  zero	  down	  payment	  loans	  and	  negative	  amortization	  loans	  during	  
the	  U.S.	  housing	  bubble	  of	  2000s.	  According	  to	  Mayer,	  Pence,	  and	  Sherlund	  (2009),	  during	  the	  
U.S.	  housing	  bubble	  period	  of	  2003-­‐2006,	  households	  with	  poor	  credit	  (the	  so-­‐called	  subprime	  
and	  Alt-­‐A	  households)	  had	  commonly	  used	  mortgages	  with	  a	  5%	  or	  zero	  down	  payments	  to	  
finance	  their	  home	  purchases.	  Some	  mortgages	  even	  allowed	  the	  borrowers	  to	  have	  negative	  
amortization	  over	  time.	  When	  the	  U.S.	  housing	  prices	  started	  to	  decline	  after	  2006,	  these	  
borrowers	  were	  more	  likely	  to	  default	  on	  their	  mortgage	  loans,	  exacerbating	  the	  housing	  
market	  decline.	  The	  high	  levels	  of	  down	  payments	  used	  by	  households	  throughout	  China	  
mitigated	  the	  risk	  of	  household	  default	  in	  the	  event	  of	  a	  future	  housing	  market	  meltdown.	  
Unless	  the	  housing	  prices	  decline	  by	  over	  30%,	  the	  mortgage	  borrowers	  are	  unlikely	  to	  default	  
on	  their	  loans.	  14	  Furthermore,	  mortgage	  loans	  in	  China	  are	  all	  recourse	  loans,	  which	  allow	  
lenders	  to	  collect	  borrowers’	  other	  assets	  in	  the	  event	  of	  mortgage	  defaults.	  These	  reasons	  
make	  a	  U.S.	  style	  subprime	  credit	  crisis	  less	  of	  a	  concern	  for	  China.

  	  According	  to	  annual	  reports	  of	  the	  China	  Banking	  Regulatory	  Commission	  (CBRC),	  the	  ratio	  of	  non-­‐performing	  
loans	  in	  residential	  mortgages	  has	  remained	  below	  0.6%	  since	  2009.	  Even	  in	  Shenzhen,	  which,	  as	  we	  discussed	  
earlier,	  experienced	  a	  large	  housing	  price	  drop	  of	  39%	  in	  2008,	  the	  ratio	  of	  non-­‐performing	  loans	  in	  our	  sample	  
remained	  lower	  than	  1.5%	  in	  2008.

the	  borrowers	  in	  the	  middle-­‐income	  group.	  	  

                             The	  financial	  burdens	  faced	  by	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  group	  are	  particularly	  interesting.	  In	  this	  
group,	  the	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  started	  at	  a	  level	  slightly	  above	  8	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities	  
in	  2003.	  In	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  this	  ratio	  remained	  at	  around	  8	  before	  2008	  and	  then	  climbed	  to	  a	  
peak	  of	  10.7	  in	  2011	  before	  dropping	  back	  to	  9.2	  in	  2012.	  In	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  this	  
ratio	  was	  very	  similar	  and	  remained	  in	  a	  tight	  range	  around	  8.	  It	  had	  a	  modest	  decline	  from	  a	  
level	  slightly	  above	  8	  in	  2003	  to	  7.2	  in	  2007	  and	  then	  climbed	  back	  to	  a	  peak	  slightly	  below	  9	  in	  
2011	  before	  dropping	  back	  to	  around	  8	  again.	  	  

                             The	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  for	  the	  middle-­‐income	  group	  was	  consistently	  lower	  than	  that	  for	  
the	  bottom-­‐income	  group.	  It	  was	  highest	  in	  the	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  and	  lowest	  in	  the	  third-­‐tier	  cities.	  
Across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities,	  it	  had	  a	  similar	  pattern	  over	  time.	  In	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  it	  had	  an	  
expansion	  from	  5.6	  in	  2003	  to	  8.3	  in	  2011	  before	  dropping	  back	  to	  7.5	  in	  2012.	  In	  second-­‐tier	  
cities,	  it	  expanded	  from	  5.7	  in	  2003	  to	  7.4	  in	  2010	  before	  dropping	  back	  to	  6.2	  in	  2012.	  In	  third-­‐
tier	  cities,	  it	  expanded	  from	  5.0	  in	  2003	  to	  6.4	  in	  2010	  before	  dropping	  back	  to	  6.2	  in	  2012.	  

                             It	  is	  useful	  to	  compare	  the	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios	  observed	  in	  Chinese	  cities	  with	  that	  in	  
other	  countries.	  	  Cheng,	  Raina,	  and	  Xiong	  (2014,	  Table	  9)	  examined	  home	  purchases	  by	  Wall	  
Street	  employees	  and	  lawyers	  in	  the	  U.S.	  during	  2000s	  and	  found	  that	  they	  had	  consistently	  
used	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios	  around	  three	  before,	  during,	  and	  after	  the	  U.S.	  housing	  bubble	  that	  
peaked	  in	  2006.	  While	  the	  households	  they	  examined	  were	  from	  the	  relatively	  high-­‐income	  
fraction	  of	  the	  U.S.	  population,	  it	  is	  common	  for	  financial	  advisors	  in	  the	  U.S.	  to	  advise	  
households	  to	  purchase	  homes	  with	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios	  of	  around	  three.15	  There	  are	  few	  
studies	  of	  financial	  burdens	  faced	  by	  mortgage	  borrowers	  during	  the	  Japanese	  housing	  bubble.

  	  The	  lack	  of	  property	  taxes	  in	  China	  has	  contributed	  to	  the	  high	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  observed	  in	  China	  relative	  
to	  that	  in	  the	  U.S.	  It	  is	  common	  for	  homeowners	  in	  the	  U.S.	  to	  pay	  annual	  property	  taxes	  in	  the	  range	  of	  1-­‐2%	  of	  
home	  values	  to	  local	  townships,	  while	  home	  owners	  in	  China	  typically	  do	  not	  pay	  any	  property	  tax.

household	  which	  may	  or	  may	  not	  be	  a	  home	  buyer,	  in	  Tokyo	  rose	  to	  8.6	  in	  1989,	  which	  is	  
consistent	  with	  the	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios	  used	  by	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  borrowers	  in	  China.	  	  	  	  

                             A	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  of	  8	  or	  higher,	  which	  had	  been	  commonly	  used	  by	  mortgage	  
borrowers	  in	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  group	  throughout	  the	  Chinese	  cities,	  implies	  substantial	  
financial	  burdens	  on	  the	  borrowers.	  	  The	  financial	  burdens	  are	  reflected	  in	  several	  dimensions.	  
First,	  in	  order	  to	  qualify	  for	  a	  mortgage	  loan,	  a	  borrower	  needs	  to	  make	  a	  down	  payment	  of	  
about	  38%	  of	  the	  home	  value	  (Figure	  12),	  which	  is	  equivalent	  to	  about	  three	  times	  of	  the	  
borrower’s	  annual	  income.	  This	  large	  down	  payment	  would	  require	  many	  years	  of	  saving.	  In	  
practice,	  many	  home	  buyers,	  who	  are	  typically	  in	  their	  early	  30s	  (as	  we	  will	  show	  below),	  rely	  
on	  savings	  of	  their	  parents	  or	  other	  close	  family	  members	  to	  make	  the	  down	  payment.16	  	  

                             Second,	  monthly	  mortgage	  payments	  also	  consume	  a	  substantial	  fraction	  of	  the	  household	  
income.	  To	  illustrate	  this	  burden,	  consider	  a	  household,	  which	  bought	  a	  home	  at	  a	  price	  that	  
was	  eight	  times	  of	  its	  annual	  disposable	  income.	  Suppose	  that	  it	  used	  its	  saving	  to	  make	  the	  
down	  payment	  at	  three	  times	  its	  annual	  income	  and	  took	  a	  mortgage	  loan	  that	  was	  five	  times	  
its	  annual	  income.	  As	  we	  describe	  in	  Appendix	  A,	  all	  mortgage	  loans	  in	  China	  carry	  floating	  rate	  
interest	  payments,	  with	  the	  rate	  determined	  by	  a	  benchmark	  lending	  rate	  set	  by	  the	  People’s	  
Bank	  of	  China.	  If	  the	  annual	  mortgage	  rate	  was	  6%,	  a	  rather	  low	  rate	  relative	  to	  the	  rate	  
observed	  in	  recent	  years,	  then	  the	  annual	  interest	  payment	  would	  consume	  6%×5 = 30%	  of	  
the	  household’s	  annual	  income.	  Furthermore,	  the	  household	  also	  needed	  to	  pay	  back	  a	  fraction	  
of	  the	  mortgage	  each	  year.	  Suppose	  that	  the	  loan	  had	  a	  maturity	  of	  30	  years	  (maximum	  
maturity	  allowed	  in	  China)	  and	  linear	  amortization.	  Then,	  the	  household	  had	  to	  set	  aside	  
                                                                        !
another	                                                                                 = 16.7%	  of	  its	  annual	  income	  to	  pay	  the	  mortgage.	  Together,	  servicing	  the	  
                                                                    !"

mortgage	  loan	  would	  consume	  46.7%	  of	  its	  annual	  income.	  	  	  	  	  

                             As	  we	  will	  discuss	  later,	  a	  significant	  fraction	  of	  home	  buyers	  in	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  group	  
were	  unmarried.	  As	  they	  would	  eventually	  get	  married	  and	  as	  it	  is	  common	  in	  China	  for	  a	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
16
  	  Due	  to	  the	  high	  savings	  rates	  by	  Chinese	  households	  and	  the	  Chinese	  tradition	  of	  children	  supporting	  parents	  in	  
their	  old	  age,	  parents	  are	  usually	  able	  and	  willing	  to	  provide	  some	  financial	  support	  to	  their	  children’s	  home	  
purchases.	  For	  this	  reason,	  there	  is	  typically	  not	  another	  hidden	  loan	  (i.e.,	  a	  loan	  taken	  through	  the	  shadow	  
banking	  system)	  to	  pay	  for	  the	  down	  payment.	  	  	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    29	  
	  
married	  couple	  to	  both	  work,	  the	  household	  income	  of	  a	  single	  buyer	  may	  soon	  double	  upon	  
his/her	  marriage.	  Then,	  the	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  of	  single	  buyers	  may	  not	  accurately	  reflect	  
their	  financial	  burdens.	  To	  isolate	  this	  issue,	  we	  also	  compute	  the	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  of	  
married	  couples	  in	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  and	  middle-­‐income	  groups	  in	  each	  tier	  of	  cities.	  The	  
bottom	  panel	  of	  Figure	  12	  shows	  that	  the	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  of	  married	  borrowers	  was	  very	  
similar	  to	  that	  of	  the	  full	  sample	  with	  both	  married	  and	  unmarried	  borrowers	  across	  both	  
income	  groups	  and	  different	  tiers	  of	  cities.	  This	  lack	  of	  difference	  may	  reflect	  the	  fact	  that	  
Chinese	  banks	  follow	  a	  rigid	  system	  of	  using	  current	  household	  income	  to	  determine	  the	  
amount	  of	  mortgage	  loans	  available	  to	  borrowers,	  regardless	  of	  their	  marital	  status.	  	  

       The	  remarkable	  income	  growth	  of	  Chinese	  households	  during	  this	  decade	  also	  implies	  that	  
the	  large	  financial	  burdens	  endured	  by	  mortgage	  borrowers	  might	  be	  temporary	  and	  would	  
subside	  over	  time	  as	  their	  income	  grew.	  Again	  consider	  the	  household,	  which	  purchased	  a	  
home	  at	  an	  initial	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  of	  eight.	  Suppose	  that	  the	  household	  expected	  its	  
income	  to	  grow	  at	  an	  annual	  rate	  of	  10%,	  which	  was	  roughly	  the	  growth	  rate	  during	  this	  period.	  
Then,	  it	  expected	  its	  income	  would	  rise	  to	  1.6	  times	  of	  its	  initial	  level	  in	  five	  years;	  the	  ratio	  of	  
the	  current	  home	  price	  to	  its	  future	  income	  in	  five	  years	  would	  be	  five.	  Of	  course,	  this	  
calculation	  depends	  on	  a	  crucial	  assumption	  that	  the	  10%	  income	  growth	  rate	  would	  persist	  
into	  the	  future.	  This	  assumption	  is	  ex	  ante	  strong	  despite	  that	  ex	  post	  the	  household	  income	  in	  
China	  has	  been	  growing	  at	  this	  impressive	  rate	  for	  three	  decades.	  	  	  

       Nevertheless,	  this	  simple	  calculation	  shows	  that	  the	  household’s	  expected	  income	  growth	  
rate	  is	  crucial	  for	  determining	  how	  much	  it	  is	  willing	  to	  pay	  for	  a	  home	  relative	  its	  current	  
income.	  If	  the	  household	  expected	  its	  income	  to	  persistently	  grow	  at	  a	  high	  rate,	  it	  would	  
expect	  the	  large	  financial	  burdens	  brought	  by	  buying	  a	  home	  at	  eight	  times	  of	  its	  current	  annual	  
income	  to	  be	  temporary.	  	  Furthermore,	  this	  expectation	  might	  also	  motivate	  an	  expectation	  
about	  high	  income	  growth	  of	  other	  households,	  which	  may	  in	  turn	  lead	  to	  an	  expectation	  that	  
housing	  prices	  will	  continue	  to	  rise.	  	  	  	  Such	  an	  expectation	  further	  motivates	  the	  household	  to	  
take	  on	  enormous	  financial	  burdens	  to	  buy	  the	  home.	  In	  this	  sense,	  the	  households’	  




                                                                                                                                                                     30	  
	  
expectations	  about	  their	  income	  growth	  and	  future	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  are	  central	  for	  
understanding	  the	  housing	  market	  boom.	  We	  will	  return	  to	  this	  issue	  in	  our	  later	  discussion.	  

D. Home	  Size	  	  

                                                                  [Figure	  13	  about	  Here]	  

       Home	  size	  is	  an	  important	  dimension	  for	  determining	  the	  consumption	  value	  of	  a	  home.	  
Figure	  13	  depicts	  the	  size	  of	  the	  homes	  purchased	  by	  bottom-­‐income	  and	  middle-­‐income	  
mortgage	  borrowers	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities.	  Despite	  the	  large	  financial	  burdens	  endured	  
by	  the	  mortgage	  borrowers,	  their	  homes	  were	  rather	  spacious.	  The	  bottom-­‐income	  borrowers	  
in	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  which	  are	  the	  most	  expensive	  cities	  in	  China,	  bought	  the	  smallest	  homes	  in	  
our	  sample.	  Even	  for	  these	  borrowers,	  the	  average	  size	  of	  their	  home	  was	  in	  a	  range	  between	  
72	  and	  80	  square	  meters	  throughout	  the	  decade.	  For	  a	  typical	  family	  of	  three	  (a	  couple	  with	  	  
one	  child	  based	  on	  China’s	  birth	  control	  policy),	  this	  home	  size	  implies	  about	  25	  square	  meters	  
per	  person,	  which	  is	  quite	  spacious	  by	  the	  standards	  of	  most	  large	  metropolitan	  areas	  in	  the	  
world	  such	  as	  Hong	  Kong,	  New	  York,	  Singapore,	  and	  Tokyo.	  	  	  

       It	  is	  also	  useful	  to	  note	  the	  evident	  declining	  trend	  in	  the	  home	  size	  purchased	  by	  all	  groups	  
in	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities.	  The	  homes	  purchased	  by	  bottom-­‐income	  borrowers	  in	  second-­‐tier	  
cities	  on	  average	  declined	  from	  90	  square	  meters	  in	  2003	  to	  80	  in	  2012,	  while	  the	  homes	  
purchased	  by	  bottom-­‐income	  borrowers	  in	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  declined	  from	  109	  square	  meters	  in	  
2004	  to	  slightly	  above	  90	  in	  2012.	  The	  homes	  purchased	  by	  middle-­‐income	  borrowers	  tended	  
to	  be	  bigger	  but	  also	  had	  a	  similar	  decline	  across	  all	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities.	  

E. Age	  and	  Marital	  Status	  

                                                                  [Figure	  14	  about	  Here]	  

       Figure	  14	  shows	  the	  age	  of	  mortgage	  borrowers	  in	  our	  sample.	  Across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  
cities,	  the	  mortgage	  borrowers	  were	  on	  average	  in	  their	  early	  30s.	  The	  borrowers	  in	  the	  
bottom-­‐income	  group	  tended	  to	  be	  slightly	  younger	  than	  those	  in	  the	  middle-­‐income	  group.	  	  

                                                                  [Figure	  15	  about	  Here]	  

                                                                                                                                                         31	  
	  
                             A	  significant	  fraction	  of	  the	  borrowers	  are	  unmarried.	  Figure	  15	  summarizes	  the	  fractions	  of	  
single	  men	  and	  single	  women	  among	  the	  mortgage	  borrowers	  in	  each	  income	  group	  and	  each	  
tier	  of	  cities.	  Single	  men	  and	  single	  women	  contributed	  to	  at	  least	  40%	  of	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  
mortgage	  borrowers	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities	  in	  each	  of	  the	  years	  from	  2003-­‐2012.	  This	  
fraction	  was	  lower	  among	  the	  middle-­‐income	  borrowers	  but	  nevertheless	  substantial.	  	  

                             Wei,	  Zhang,	  and	  Liu	  (2014)	  argue	  that	  home	  ownership	  is	  a	  status	  good	  for	  single	  men	  to	  
strengthen	  their	  competitiveness	  in	  the	  marriage	  market	  due	  to	  the	  widespread	  sex	  imbalance	  
in	  China.	  This	  argument	  implies	  that	  single	  men	  should	  be	  more	  eager	  to	  buy	  homes	  than	  single	  
women.	  Consistent	  with	  this	  argument,	  the	  fraction	  of	  single	  men	  among	  mortgage	  borrowers	  
was	  consistently	  higher	  than	  the	  fraction	  of	  single	  women	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  across	  
all	  years	  and	  across	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  and	  middle-­‐income	  borrower	  groups.	  However,	  in	  first-­‐
tier	  cities,	  the	  fraction	  of	  single	  men	  was	  roughly	  the	  same	  as	  the	  fraction	  of	  single	  women	  
among	  the	  middle-­‐income	  borrowers,	  and	  the	  fraction	  of	  single	  men	  was	  even	  lower	  than	  the	  
fraction	  of	  single	  women	  among	  the	  bottom-­‐income	  borrowers	  throughout	  the	  sample	  
period.17	  	  This	  suggests	  that	  while	  marriage	  market	  competition	  might	  be	  a	  determinant	  of	  
home	  ownership	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  it	  is	  not	  as	  relevant	  for	  understanding	  the	  
particularly	  high	  housing	  prices	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities.	  	  	  	  	  	  

F. Second	  Mortgages	  	  

                             An	  often	  discussed	  concern	  regarding	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  markets	  is	  that	  many	  urban	  
households	  hold	  multiple	  homes	  and	  leave	  a	  significant	  fraction	  of	  homes	  vacant	  for	  prolonged	  
periods	  of	  time.	  Our	  mortgage	  data	  allow	  us	  to	  separate	  second	  mortgages	  (i.e.,	  mortgage	  
loans	  taken	  by	  households	  to	  purchase	  second	  homes)	  from	  first	  mortgages	  (i.e.,	  single	  
mortgages	  taken	  by	  households)	  after	  2010.18	  	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [Table	  2	  about	  Here]	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
17
  	  This	  pattern	  is	  consistent	  with	  casual	  observations	  that	  sex	  imbalance	  is	  less	  severe	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  as	  people	  in	  
these	  cities	  have	  been	  more	  open-­‐minded	  about	  having	  girls	  and	  thus	  less	  prone	  to	  selecting	  the	  sex	  of	  their	  
children.	  	  	  
18
  	  As	  we	  explain	  in	  Section	  6,	  in	  early	  2010	  the	  Chinese	  government	  raised	  the	  down-­‐payment	  ratio	  and	  the	  
interest	  rate	  on	  second	  mortgages,	  making	  them	  higher	  than	  those	  for	  first	  mortgages.	  Since	  then,	  banks	  need	  to	  
collect	  information	  about	  whether	  each	  mortgage	  is	  a	  first	  or	  second.	  	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        32	  
	  
                             Table	  2	  summarizes	  the	  fraction	  of	  second	  mortgages	  among	  all	  mortgage	  loans	  issued	  in	  
each	  tier	  of	  cities	  in	  each	  year	  between	  2011	  and	  2013.	  	  This	  fraction	  offers	  a	  measure	  of	  the	  
extent	  that	  households	  took	  loans	  to	  buy	  investment	  homes.	  As	  wealthy	  households	  may	  
simply	  use	  cash	  to	  buy	  investment	  homes,	  such	  investment	  purchases	  by	  wealthy	  households	  
do	  not	  appear	  in	  our	  mortgage	  data.	  Thus,	  the	  fraction	  of	  second	  mortgages	  underestimates	  
the	  home	  purchases	  driven	  by	  investment	  demands.	  	  

                             In	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  the	  fraction	  of	  second	  mortgages	  was	  5.3%	  and	  5.2%	  in	  2011	  and	  2012,	  
respectively,	  and	  this	  fraction	  had	  a	  dramatic	  increase	  to	  11.8%	  in	  2013.	  In	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐
tier	  cities,	  the	  fraction	  of	  second	  mortgages	  also	  had	  an	  increasing	  trend	  during	  this	  period,	  
although	  the	  levels	  were	  much	  lower.	  In	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  this	  fraction	  grew	  from	  2.0%	  in	  2011	  
to	  2.4%	  in	  2012	  and	  3.3%	  in	  2013.	  In	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  it	  grew	  from	  1.0%	  in	  2011	  to	  1.3%	  in	  2012	  
and	  1.8%	  in	  2013.	  Taken	  together,	  mortgage-­‐financed	  investment	  home	  purchases	  were	  much	  
more	  pervasive	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  than	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities.19	  	  

                             In	  summary,	  our	  analysis	  of	  the	  mortgage	  data	  shows	  that	  despite	  the	  enormous	  housing	  
price	  appreciation	  during	  the	  last	  decade,	  the	  participation	  of	  low-­‐income	  households	  in	  the	  
housing	  markets	  remained	  steady.	  Nevertheless,	  the	  relatively	  low-­‐income	  home	  buyers	  
endured	  severe	  financial	  burdens	  in	  order	  to	  buy	  homes	  at	  prices	  commonly	  over	  eight	  times	  
their	  current	  income.	  This	  behavior	  reflected	  expectations	  of	  persistently	  high	  income	  growth	  
and	  further	  high	  housing	  price	  appreciation.	  	  	  	  


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        5. Housing	  as	  an	  Investment	  Vehicle	  

                             The	  spectacular	  economic	  growth	  of	  China	  since	  the	  1980s	  has	  been	  accompanied	  by	  a	  high	  
savings	  rate.	  According	  to	  Yang,	  Zhang,	  and	  Zhou	  (2013),	  the	  gross	  national	  savings	  as	  a	  
percentage	  of	  GDP	  averaged	  35%	  during	  the	  1980s,	  41%	  during	  the	  1990s,	  and	  surged	  to	  over	  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
19
  	  The	  fraction	  of	  second	  mortgages	  in	  our	  mortgage	  data	  may	  appear	  substantially	  lower	  than	  the	  fraction	  of	  
households	  owning	  multiple	  homes	  reported	  by	  Chinese	  Household	  Finance	  Survey	  (2012).	  According	  to	  this	  
survey	  conducted	  in	  2012,	  the	  fraction	  of	  urban	  households	  owning	  at	  least	  two	  apartments	  in	  China	  is	  15.44%.	  
Note	  that	  a	  significant	  fraction	  of	  the	  multiple	  homes	  owned	  by	  the	  surveyed	  households	  was	  probably	  old-­‐style	  
housing	  units	  that	  were	  assigned	  to	  the	  households	  by	  their	  employers	  as	  in-­‐kind	  compensation	  before	  the	  
housing	  reform	  in	  late	  1990s.	  These	  units	  tended	  to	  have	  undesirable	  qualities	  and	  were	  different	  from	  the	  newly	  
built	  homes-­‐-­‐the	  typical	  homes	  bought	  by	  households	  in	  recent	  years.	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              33	  
	  
50%	  in	  the	  2000s.	  This	  high	  saving	  rate	  surpassed	  the	  rates	  of	  all	  major	  countries	  during	  the	  
same	  period	  and	  was	  also	  higher	  than	  the	  prevailing	  rates	  in	  Japan,	  South	  Korea,	  and	  other	  East	  
Asian	  economies	  during	  the	  years	  of	  their	  miracle	  growth.	  	  Households,	  firms,	  and	  the	  
government	  have	  all	  contributed	  to	  the	  remarkably	  high	  savings	  rate	  in	  China.	  	  Savings	  by	  
households	  and	  firms	  had	  each	  reached	  about	  20%	  of	  the	  GDP	  during	  the	  2000s.	  	  	  	  

                             Despite	  the	  high	  savings	  rate,	  households	  and	  firms	  in	  China	  have	  limited	  vehicles	  in	  which	  
to	  invest	  their	  massive	  savings.	  Bank	  deposit	  accounts	  are	  the	  predominant	  investment	  vehicle	  
in	  China.	  Due	  to	  China's	  restrictive	  capital	  controls,	  households	  and	  firms	  cannot	  freely	  invest	  
their	  savings	  in	  capital	  markets	  outside	  of	  China,	  and	  although	  they	  can	  invest	  in	  the	  stock	  
market	  inside	  China,	  it	  is	  still	  small	  by	  size	  relative	  to	  the	  pool	  of	  savings	  and	  has	  not	  offered	  
attractive	  returns	  in	  the	  last	  two	  decades.20	  Bond	  markets	  in	  China	  are	  even	  smaller.	  Given	  
these	  limited	  investment	  choices,	  Chinese	  households	  often	  use	  housing	  as	  an	  alternative	  
investment	  vehicle.	  In	  this	  section,	  we	  discuss	  the	  performance	  of	  housing	  as	  an	  investment	  
vehicle,	  in	  comparison	  to	  bank	  deposits	  and	  stock	  market.

                             Figure	  16	  shows	  that	  total	  bank	  deposits	  in	  China	  rose	  from	  slightly	  above	  20	  trillion	  RMB	  in	  
2003	  to	  over	  100	  trillion	  in	  2013.	  	  The	  deposit	  rate	  is	  regulated	  by	  the	  central	  bank.	  As	  shown	  in	  
Figure	  4,	  the	  nominal	  bank	  deposit	  rate	  remained	  in	  a	  narrow	  range,	  between	  2	  and	  4	  percent	  
in	  2003-­‐2013,	  while	  the	  national	  inflation	  rate	  frequently	  surpassed	  the	  nominal	  deposit	  rate	  in	  
2004,	  2008-­‐2009,	  and	  2011-­‐2012,	  making	  the	  real	  deposit	  rate	  negative.	  The	  average	  real	  
deposit	  rate	  in	  2003-­‐2013	  was	  0.01	  percent.	  This	  low	  deposit	  rate	  makes	  the	  huge	  pool	  of	  bank	  
deposits	  rather	  striking.	  Nevertheless,	  the	  low	  deposit	  rate	  has	  motivated	  Chinese	  households	  
to	  search	  for	  alternative	  vehicles	  to	  invest	  their	  massive	  savings.

  	  There	  is	  a	  debate	  regarding	  the	  performance	  of	  the	  Chinese	  stock	  market.	  On	  one	  hand,	  Allen,	  et	  al	  (2014)	  argue	  
that	  despite	  China's	  spectacular	  economic	  growth,	  the	  Chinese	  stock	  market	  has	  performed	  rather	  poorly.	  On	  the	  
other	  hand,	  Carpenter,	  Lu	  and	  Whitelaw	  (2014)	  argue	  that	  the	  Chinese	  stock	  market	  has	  become	  as	  informative	  
about	  future	  corporate	  profits	  as	  the	  U.S.	  stock	  market.

B.	  Stocks	  

       China	  established	  two	  stock	  exchanges	  in	  the	  early	  1990s,	  one	  in	  Shanghai	  and	  the	  other	  in	  
Shenzhen.	  Figure	  16	  shows	  that	  the	  market	  capitalization	  of	  all	  floating	  shares	  in	  the	  stock	  
market	  grew	  from	  less	  than	  2	  trillion	  RMB	  in	  2003	  to	  near	  20	  trillion	  in	  2013.	  Despite	  this	  rapid	  
expansion,	  the	  size	  of	  the	  stock	  market	  was	  still	  substantially	  smaller	  than	  the	  total	  bank	  
deposits.	  	  

                                                                    [Figure	  17	  about	  Here]	  

       Figure	  17	  depicts	  the	  Shanghai	  Stock	  Market	  Index,	  a	  widely	  followed	  index	  for	  the	  Chinese	  
stock	  market,	  for	  2003-­‐2013.	  This	  period	  witnessed	  a	  dramatic	  stock	  market	  boom	  and	  bust	  in	  
2006-­‐2008,	  when	  the	  index	  rose	  from	  1200	  at	  the	  beginning	  of	  2006	  to	  a	  peak	  of	  6092	  in	  
October	  2007	  and	  then	  plunged	  to	  just	  below	  2000	  in	  October	  2008.	  This	  boom	  and	  bust	  cycle	  
mostly	  coincided	  with	  the	  rise	  and	  fall	  of	  stock	  markets	  all	  over	  the	  world	  in	  conjunction	  with	  
the	  financial	  crisis	  in	  2008.	  Since	  2008,	  the	  Shanghai	  Stock	  Market	  Index	  recovered	  in	  2009	  to	  a	  
level	  slightly	  above	  3000,	  but	  declined	  again	  after	  2010	  to	  a	  level	  around	  2000.	  	  

                                                                      [Table	  3	  about	  Here]	  

       Table	  3	  summarizes	  the	  risk	  and	  return	  from	  investing	  in	  the	  Shanghai	  Stock	  Market	  Index	  in	  
2003-­‐2013.	  During	  this	  period,	  its	  annual	  return	  was	  an	  average	  of	  7.3%	  and	  it	  had	  volatility	  of	  
51.5%.	  This	  high	  volatility	  is	  not	  surprising	  given	  the	  dramatic	  stock	  market	  boom	  and	  bust	  in	  
2006-­‐2008.	  To	  isolate	  this	  boom	  and	  bust	  period,	  Table	  3	  also	  splits	  the	  sample	  into	  two	  sub-­‐

average	  of	  8.98%	  and	  a	  staggering	  volatility	  of	  66.1%.	  In	  the	  second	  half	  (2009-­‐2013),	  the	  index

       Table	  4	  summarizes	  the	  annual	  returns	  of	  the	  housing	  indices	  of	  first-­‐,	  second-­‐,	  and	  third-­‐

annual	  return	  at	  a	  staggering	  level	  of	  15.7%	  and	  return	  volatility	  of	  15.4%,	  second-­‐tier	  cities	  
offered	  an	  average	  return	  of	  13.4%	  and	  volatility	  of	  9.9%,	  while	  third	  tier	  cities	  offered	  the	  
lowest	  average	  return	  of	  11.0%	  among	  the	  three	  tiers	  and	  also	  the	  lowest	  volatility	  of	  7.5%.	  
Relative	  to	  the	  stock	  index	  return	  in	  the	  same	  period,	  the	  housing	  indices	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  
all	  offered	  higher	  average	  returns	  and,	  more	  impressively,	  much	  lower	  volatility.	  Despite	  the	  
economic	  turmoil	  after	  2008,	  the	  volatility	  of	  housing	  returns	  had	  been	  remarkably	  low.	  	  

       During	  the	  first	  half	  of	  the	  sample,	  2003-­‐2008,	  the	  housing	  returns	  were	  particularly	  high	  for	  
first-­‐	  and	  second-­‐tier	  cities,	  with	  the	  first-­‐tier	  housing	  index	  offering	  an	  average	  return	  of	  20.4%	  
and	  the	  second-­‐tier	  17.3%.	  During	  the	  second	  half	  of	  the	  sample,	  2009-­‐2013,	  average	  returns	  of	  
both	  the	  first-­‐and	  second-­‐tier	  were	  lower	  at	  10.9%	  and	  9.7%,	  which	  are	  nevertheless	  attractive	  
relative	  to	  the	  average	  stock	  index	  return	  during	  the	  same	  period.	  The	  index	  return	  of	  third-­‐tier	  
cities	  was	  stable	  across	  the	  two	  sub-­‐samples	  at	  11.7%	  and	  10.3%,	  respectively.	  	  

       Overall,	  the	  housing	  returns	  from	  all	  three	  tiers	  of	  Chinese	  cities	  were	  surprisingly	  resilient	  
across	  the	  economic	  crisis	  period	  of	  2008-­‐2009	  and	  offered	  returns	  substantially	  more	  
attractive	  than	  bank	  deposits	  and	  the	  Chinese	  stock	  market.	  


                                                                6. 	  Discussion	  

       Our	  analysis	  provides	  some	  basic	  facts	  to	  allow	  us	  to	  understand	  and	  interpret	  the	  Chinese	  
housing	  boom.	  In	  this	  section,	  we	  offer	  discussion	  based	  on	  these	  facts.	  

       Housing	  booms	  are	  often	  associated	  with	  credit	  expansions,	  with	  the	  recent	  housing	  bubble	  
in	  the	  U.S.	  being	  a	  vivid	  example.	  As	  a	  result,	  commentators	  have	  often	  been	  concerned	  by	  the	  
potential	  risk	  of	  excessive	  leverage	  in	  driving	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  boom.	  As	  we	  have	  described	  
earlier,	  Chinese	  banks	  have	  required	  down	  payments	  of	  over	  30	  percent	  for	  all	  mortgage	  loans.	  
Such	  high	  down	  payment	  ratios	  substantially	  alleviate	  the	  household	  default	  risk	  faced	  by	  banks	  
and	  make	  reckless	  credit	  expansions	  to	  households	  an	  unlikely	  cause	  of	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  
boom.	  	  




                                                                                                                                                    36	  
	  
       A	  particular	  concern	  about	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  boom	  is	  that	  the	  enormous	  housing	  price	  
appreciation	  across	  Chinese	  cities	  might	  constitute	  a	  housing	  bubble	  that	  is	  about	  to	  burst.	  As	  is	  
well	  known	  by	  economists,	  it	  is	  difficult	  to	  reliably	  identify	  an	  asset	  bubble.	  There	  may	  or	  may	  
not	  be	  a	  housing	  bubble	  in	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  market.	  To	  forcefully	  determine	  the	  presence	  of	  
a	  housing	  bubble,	  one	  needs	  to	  develop	  a	  systematic	  framework	  of	  supply	  and	  demand	  of	  
housing	  that	  fully	  accounts	  for	  the	  growth	  of	  the	  Chinese	  economy	  and	  the	  frictions	  in	  the	  
Chinese	  financial	  system.	  This	  entails	  a	  task	  substantially	  more	  ambitious	  than	  the	  goal	  of	  this	  
paper.	  Nevertheless,	  our	  analysis	  offers	  some	  useful	  observations	  about	  the	  nature	  of	  this	  
nationwide	  housing	  boom.	  

       On	  one	  hand,	  the	  enormous	  price	  appreciation	  does	  not	  necessarily	  indicate	  the	  presence	  
of	  a	  bubble,	  as	  the	  price	  appreciation	  has	  been	  mostly	  accompanied	  by	  equally	  impressive	  
household	  income	  growth,	  except	  in	  a	  few	  first-­‐tier	  cities.	  	  On	  the	  other	  hand,	  housing	  prices	  
are	  indeed	  expensive	  relative	  to	  the	  income	  of	  many	  households,	  in	  particular,	  of	  the	  low-­‐
income	  mortgage	  borrowers.	  While	  one	  can	  justify	  their	  willingness,	  despite	  the	  severe	  
financial	  burdens,	  to	  buy	  homes	  based	  on	  expectations	  of	  persistently	  high	  income	  growth,	  the	  
high	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratios	  observed	  across	  Chinese	  cities	  expose	  the	  housing	  market	  to	  
substantial	  risks	  when	  households’	  expectations	  are	  subdued	  in	  the	  future,	  especially	  in	  the	  
event	  of	  a	  sudden	  stop	  in	  the	  Chinese	  economy.	  	  	  	  	  	  

       Our	  analysis	  also	  highlights	  a	  few	  key	  ingredients	  for	  future	  efforts	  to	  develop	  a	  systematic	  
framework	  for	  analyzing	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  market:	  	  	  	  

       1. The	  housing	  market	  across	  first-­‐,	  second-­‐,	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  offered	  high	  returns,	  
             substantially	  more	  attractive	  than	  bank	  deposits	  and	  the	  Chinese	  stock	  market.	  	  	  

       2. Housing	  price	  levels	  were	  also	  high	  across	  the	  three	  tiers	  of	  cities	  with	  low-­‐income	  
             households	  buying	  homes	  at	  prices	  that	  were	  over	  eight	  times	  their	  annual	  income.	  	  

       3. Concurrent	  with	  the	  housing	  boom,	  Chinese	  households	  also	  accumulated	  a	  large	  pool	  
             of	  cash	  in	  bank	  deposits	  that	  paid	  a	  minimal	  deposit	  rate.	  	  



                                                                                                                                                    37	  
	  
                             It	  is	  important	  to	  fully	  account	  for	  the	  distortions	  brought	  to	  the	  housing	  market	  by	  the	  
imperfections	  in	  the	  Chinese	  financial	  system.	  The	  low	  bank	  deposit	  rate	  that	  had	  persisted	  
throughout	  the	  studied	  decade	  is	  a	  key	  factor.	  To	  the	  extent	  that	  near	  100	  trillion	  RMB	  has	  
been	  sitting	  in	  bank	  deposits	  earning	  an	  almost	  zero	  real	  rate,	  households’	  investment	  demand	  
for	  housing	  is	  an	  important	  driver	  of	  housing	  prices	  in	  China.21	  	  	  	  

                             Beside	  the	  well-­‐known	  illiquidity	  of	  housing,	  risk	  is	  an	  important	  dimension	  in	  evaluating	  
housing	  as	  an	  investment	  asset.	  It	  is	  difficult	  to	  measure	  the	  crash	  risk	  of	  the	  housing	  market	  
based	  on	  month-­‐to-­‐month	  price	  fluctuations.	  The	  housing	  market	  was	  rather	  resilient	  across	  
the	  crisis	  period	  of	  2008-­‐2009.	  	  In	  this	  regard,	  the	  housing	  market	  has	  been	  more	  robust	  to	  
crash	  risk,	  relative	  to	  the	  stock	  market,	  even	  though	  the	  low	  risk	  experienced	  by	  the	  housing	  
market	  in	  the	  past	  does	  not	  necessarily	  imply	  low	  risk	  going	  forward.	  As	  discussed	  by	  Pritchett	  
and	  Summers	  (2014),	  the	  spectacular	  growth	  rate	  of	  the	  Chinese	  economy	  during	  the	  last	  three	  
decades	  is	  clearly	  a	  rare	  event	  and	  the	  powerful	  force	  of	  regression	  to	  the	  mean	  would	  make	  a	  
continued	  high	  growth	  rate	  of	  9	  or	  even	  7	  or	  6	  percent	  an	  even	  more	  unlikely	  event.	  This	  
argument	  implies	  a	  substantial	  risk	  of	  an	  eventual	  economic	  slowdown.	  To	  the	  extent	  that	  low-­‐
income	  households	  were	  buying	  homes	  by	  enduring	  substantial	  financial	  burdens,	  the	  risk	  
perceived	  by	  them	  was	  unlikely	  to	  be	  large.	  Thus,	  a	  systematic	  framework	  needs	  to	  account	  for	  
the	  expectations	  of	  households,	  in	  particular,	  their	  optimistic	  expectations	  about	  persistently	  
high	  growth	  rates	  into	  the	  future.22	  	  	  

                             It	  is	  also	  useful	  to	  note	  that	  housing	  demand	  may	  also	  be	  driven	  by	  reasons	  beyond	  
consumption	  and	  investment	  needs.	  Wei,	  Zhang,	  and	  Liu	  (2014)	  emphasize	  the	  role	  of	  housing	  
as	  a	  status	  good,	  which	  strengthens	  the	  competitiveness	  of	  unmarried	  men	  in	  an	  unbalanced	  
marriage	  market	  where	  men	  substantially	  outnumber	  women.	  	  Indeed,	  our	  analysis	  also

  	  Chen	  and	  Wen	  (2014)	  derive	  a	  theory	  to	  explain	  the	  persistently	  faster-­‐than-­‐GDP	  housing	  price	  growth	  during	  
the	  Chinese	  housing	  boom	  based	  on	  an	  idea	  that	  a	  self-­‐fulfilling	  housing	  bubble	  can	  induce	  productive	  
entrepreneurs	  to	  divert	  capital	  from	  profitable	  investment	  projects	  in	  order	  to	  speculate	  in	  housing.

Internet	  search	  data.	  They	  show	  that	  this	  index	  predicts	  subsequent	  housing	  price	  appreciation	  and	  new	  housing	  
construction.	  	  	  	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    38

       While	  our	  analysis	  has	  been	  largely	  focused	  on	  the	  demand	  side	  of	  the	  housing	  market,	  the	  
supply	  side	  is	  equally	  important.	  There	  is	  still	  a	  lack	  of	  systematic	  understanding	  of	  housing	  
supply	  in	  Chinese	  cities.	  To	  the	  extent	  that	  housing	  prices	  have	  been	  rising	  at	  a	  pace	  
comparable	  to	  or	  even	  higher	  than	  the	  households’	  income	  growth	  rate	  during	  the	  decade,	  the	  
housing	  market	  equilibrium	  implies	  that	  the	  growth	  of	  housing	  supply	  was	  likely	  to	  have	  stayed	  
either	  below	  or	  comparable	  to	  the	  growth	  of	  housing	  demand,	  even	  though	  Deng,	  Gyourko,	  
and	  Wu	  (2014b)	  document	  some	  evidence	  of	  a	  large	  housing	  inventory	  held	  by	  developers	  in	  
several	  major	  cities	  in	  recent	  years.	  Different	  from	  U.S.	  cities	  where	  housing	  supply	  is	  often	  
determined	  by	  landscape	  and	  local	  zoning	  restrictions,	  e.g.,	  Saiz	  (2010),	  housing	  supply	  in	  
Chinese	  cities	  is	  determined	  by	  land	  sold	  by	  local	  governments	  for	  housing	  development,	  as	  
land	  is	  legally	  owned	  by	  the	  state	  and	  controlled	  by	  local	  governments.	  As	  we	  will	  discuss	  in	  the	  
next	  section,	  land	  sale	  revenues	  have	  contributed	  to	  a	  substantial	  fraction	  of	  local	  governments’	  
fiscal	  budget.	  As	  a	  local	  monopoly	  of	  land	  supply,	  local	  governments’	  land	  sales	  strategy	  is	  a	  key	  
factor	  in	  determining	  housing	  prices	  in	  Chinese	  cities.	  	  	  	  


                                       7. Roles	  of	  Government	  in	  the	  Housing	  Market	  

       In	  China,	  the	  governments	  at	  the	  central	  and	  local	  levels	  have	  been	  actively	  engaged	  in	  the	  
housing	  market.	  The	  powerful	  forces	  induced	  by	  government	  policies	  not	  only	  directly	  affect	  
physical	  aspects	  of	  the	  housing	  market	  such	  as	  supply	  of	  land	  and	  availability	  of	  funds	  to	  buyers,	  
but	  also	  delicately	  influence	  expectations	  and	  confidence	  of	  households	  about	  the	  housing	  
market.	  This	  is	  an	  important	  channel	  for	  understanding	  the	  drastically	  divergent	  performance	  
of	  the	  housing	  and	  stock	  markets	  after	  2008.	  In	  this	  section,	  we	  briefly	  discuss	  the	  role	  of	  
government	  in	  the	  housing	  market,	  first	  on	  the	  policy	  interventions	  of	  the	  central	  government	  
and	  then	  on	  the	  dependence	  of	  local	  governments	  on	  land	  sales	  for	  their	  fiscal	  revenues.	  	  	  	  

A. Interventions	  by	  the	  Central	  Government	  



                                                                                                                                                     39	  
	  
                             By	  2007,	  housing	  prices	  in	  most	  Chinese	  cities	  had	  grown	  substantially,	  as	  discussed	  in	  
Section	  3.	  In	  response,	  the	  central	  government	  implemented	  a	  series	  of	  monetary	  and	  fiscal	  
policies	  to	  curb	  soaring	  prices	  and	  curtail	  speculative	  activities	  in	  the	  housing	  market.	  For	  
example,	  in	  September	  2007,	  the	  central	  government	  raised	  the	  minimum	  down	  payment	  ratio	  
from	  30	  percent	  to	  40	  percent,	  raised	  the	  interest	  rate	  on	  second	  mortgages	  to	  10	  percent	  
higher	  than	  the	  benchmark	  rate,	  and	  capped	  the	  monthly	  mortgage	  payment-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  
at	  50%.	  In	  April	  2008,	  it	  imposed	  tax	  on	  capital	  gains	  from	  housing	  sales.	  The	  government	  also	  
started	  to	  increase	  the	  construction	  of	  government-­‐subsidized	  housing,	  such	  as	  affordable	  
housing,	  low-­‐cost	  housing,	  and	  public	  rental	  housing,	  to	  help	  relieve	  the	  pressure	  on	  the	  
housing	  market.	  

                             These	  policies	  might	  have	  had	  some	  effects	  on	  housing	  prices,	  especially	  in	  cities	  in	  
Guangzhou	  and	  Shenzhen	  during	  this	  period,	  though	  it	  is	  hard	  to	  distinguish	  the	  effects	  of	  the	  
policies	  from	  that	  of	  the	  emerging	  global	  economic	  crisis.	  In	  any	  event,	  in	  October	  2008	  the	  
central	  government	  abruptly	  reversed	  these	  policies,	  and	  installed	  a	  series	  of	  measures	  to	  
support	  housing	  market	  recovery.	  It	  reduced	  the	  minimum	  mortgage	  rates	  to	  70	  percent	  of	  the	  
benchmark	  rate	  and	  the	  down-­‐payment	  ratio	  to	  30	  percent.	  As	  part	  of	  its	  4	  trillion	  RMB	  
stimulus	  package,	  it	  also	  designated	  the	  real	  estate	  sector	  as	  one	  of	  the	  primary	  industries	  for	  
investment.	  As	  a	  result,	  the	  housing	  market	  regained	  momentum	  in	  mid-­‐2009	  and	  started	  a	  
new	  round	  of	  rapid	  price	  appreciation.	  

                             In	  early	  2010,	  the	  government	  introduced	  a	  series	  of	  measures,	  some	  traditional	  and	  some	  
less	  standard,	  to	  cool	  off	  what	  were	  widely	  considered	  a	  once	  again	  overheating	  housing	  
market.	  It	  again	  raised	  the	  down-­‐payment	  ratio	  to	  40%	  and	  the	  interest	  rate	  on	  second	  
mortgages.	  More	  important,	  starting	  in	  April	  2010,	  following	  the	  guidelines	  of	  the	  central	  
government,	  39	  of	  the	  70	  major	  cities	  in	  China	  introduced	  the	  housing	  purchase	  restriction	  
policies.23	  Under	  these	  policies,	  only	  those	  with	  local	  Hukou	  (household	  registration),	  or	  those	  

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
23
  	  The	  housing	  purchase	  restriction	  policy	  was	  initiated	  by	  the	  central	  government	  under	  the	  so-­‐called	  “New	  
National	  Ten	  Articles”	  and	  “New	  National	  Eight	  Articles”	  issued	  in	  April	  2010	  and	  January	  2011	  respectively,	  which	  
provided	  guidelines	  saying	  that	  housing	  purchase	  restrictions	  should	  be	  implemented	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  and	  could	  
be	  extended	  to	  second-­‐	  and	  even	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  on	  an	  as-­‐needed	  basis.	  	  In	  Beijing,	  for	  example,	  the	  policy	  
requires	  that	  only	  a	  household	  with	  household	  registration	  in	  Beijing	  can	  buy	  a	  new	  apartment.	  Migrants	  living	  in	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    40	  
	  
who	  could	  show	  proof	  of	  employment	  in	  the	  city	  for	  certain	  consecutive	  years,	  were	  eligible	  for	  
purchasing	  one	  or	  two	  new	  homes.	  Though	  not	  covered	  in	  our	  sample	  period,	  the	  slowdown	  in	  
the	  Chinese	  economy	  has	  led	  to	  a	  slowdown	  of	  the	  residential	  housing	  market	  since	  the	  end	  of	  
2013.	  Many	  cities	  loosened	  the	  purchase	  restrictions	  in	  mid-­‐	  2014.	  Currently,	  the	  housing	  
purchase	  restriction	  policies	  are	  in	  force	  only	  in	  the	  four	  first-­‐tier	  cities.	  

                             The	  frequent	  interventions	  by	  the	  central	  government	  have	  created	  a	  sense	  among	  the	  
households	  that	  the	  housing	  market	  is	  too	  important	  to	  fall,	  as	  whenever	  the	  market	  started	  to	  
fall,	  the	  central	  government	  would	  provide	  supports	  to	  sustain	  it.	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

B. Land	  Sales	  and	  Fiscal	  Revenue	  of	  Local	  Governments	  

                             Land	  sale	  revenues	  have	  contributed	  to	  a	  substantial	  fraction	  of	  local	  governments’	  budgets.	  
This	  feature	  was	  a	  result	  of	  the	  fiscal	  reforms	  enacted	  in	  1994.	  In	  the	  reforms,	  the	  central	  
government	  consolidated	  provisions	  for	  tax	  revenue	  collection	  and	  sharing	  in	  order	  to	  
redistribute	  tax	  revenues	  to	  less	  developed	  areas.	  As	  is	  well	  known,	  local	  officials	  in	  China	  were	  
evaluated	  for	  promotion	  based	  to	  a	  large	  extent	  on	  regional	  economic	  growth	  (Li	  and	  Zhou,	  
2005),	  which	  provided	  strong	  incentives	  for	  investment	  in	  infrastructure	  and	  capital	  projects.	  
However,	  unlike	  local	  governments	  in	  western	  countries,	  local	  Chinese	  governments	  do	  not	  
have	  many	  sources	  of	  revenue.	  In	  particular,	  local	  governments	  in	  China	  are	  not	  authorized	  to	  
levy	  sales	  taxes,	  property	  taxes,	  or	  local	  income	  taxes,	  which	  are	  important	  sources	  of	  revenue	  
for	  local	  governments	  in	  western	  countries.	  Moreover,	  local	  governments	  in	  China	  are

2011	  averaged	  across	  all	  cities,	  as	  well	  as	  among	  the	  first-­‐tier,	  second-­‐tier,	  and	  all	  other	  cities.	  
At	  the	  national	  level,	  this	  share	  started	  at	  68%	  in	  2003	  and	  decreased	  to	  42%	  in	  2008,	  only	  to	  
bounce	  back	  to	  even	  higher	  than	  70%	  in	  2010	  and	  2011.	  	  Across	  these	  tiers,	  the	  share	  is	  
relatively	  low	  for	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  as	  their	  municipal	  governments	  have	  more	  sources	  of	  revenues,	  
but	  high	  for	  second-­‐tier	  and	  other	  cities.	  For	  the	  cities	  outside	  the	  first-­‐	  and	  second-­‐tiers,	  
revenue	  from	  land	  sales	  was	  particularly	  high,	  contributing	  over	  90%	  of	  their	  fiscal	  budgets	  in	  
some	  years,	  such	  as	  2003	  and	  2010.	  	  	  	  

                             The	  central	  government	  has	  also	  allowed	  the	  local	  governments	  to	  create	  a	  unique	  funding	  
mechanism	  known	  as	  Local	  Government-­‐Backed	  Investment	  Units,	  through	  which	  future	  land-­‐
sales	  revenue	  can	  be	  pledged	  as	  collateral.24	  	  Local	  governments	  have	  used	  such	  investment	  
units	  to	  access	  capital	  markets	  and	  issue	  bonds	  that	  would	  allow	  more	  large-­‐scale	  
infrastructure/capital	  investment,	  as	  well	  as	  other	  economic	  development	  and	  social	  insurance	  
initiatives.	  This	  unique	  mixing	  of	  local	  governmental	  fiscal	  policies	  with	  local	  housing	  markets	  
implies	  that	  a	  substantial	  drop	  in	  housing	  or	  land	  prices	  might	  lead	  to	  financial	  distress	  of	  local	  
governments	  or	  even	  trigger	  defaults	  by	  Local	  Government-­‐Backed	  Investment	  Units,	  which	  
would	  be	  equivalent	  to	  defaults	  by	  the	  local	  governments.	  As	  a	  result,	  many	  households	  in	  
China	  have	  been	  emboldened	  to	  believe	  that	  the	  housing	  market	  is	  “too	  important	  to	  fall,”	  and	  
that	  the	  central	  government	  will	  be	  forced	  to	  institute	  policies	  to	  pump	  up	  the	  housing	  market	  
if	  it	  was	  to	  deteriorate,	  just	  as	  it	  had	  done	  in	  the	  past.	  	  

                             Taken	  together,	  the	  heavy	  reliance	  of	  local	  governments	  on	  land	  sales	  revenue	  for	  their	  
fiscal	  budgets	  also	  helped	  to	  create	  a	  belief	  among	  many	  households	  that	  the	  housing	  market	  
was	  too	  important	  to	  fall.	  This	  belief	  might	  have	  contributed	  to	  the	  resilient	  housing	  prices	  
throughout	  the	  last	  decade.

  	  According	  to	  the	  latest	  available	  statistics	  published	  by	  the	  National	  Audit	  Office,	  by	  the	  end	  of	  June	  2013,	  the	  
total	  volume	  of	  outstanding	  balances	  on	  local	  government	  debts	  reached	  10.89	  trillion	  RMB,	  equivalent	  to	  19.15%	  
of	  China's	  GDP	  in	  2013,	  surpassing	  the	  9.81	  trillion	  total	  volume	  of	  central	  government	  debt	  during	  the	  same	  
period.	  	  	  	  Future	  land	  sales	  revenue	  was	  used	  as	  collateral	  in	  37.23%	  of	  the	  local	  government	  debt.	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      42	  
	  
                             In	  this	  section,	  we	  discuss	  the	  key	  risk	  factors	  facing	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  market.	  The	  most	  
important	  risk	  factor	  is	  no	  doubt	  related	  to	  the	  income	  growth	  rate.	  As	  the	  Chinese	  economy	  
enters	  a	  new	  phase	  of	  growth,	  the	  annual	  GDP	  growth	  rate	  will	  inevitably	  drop	  from	  its	  nearly	  
10	  percent	  growth	  of	  the	  last	  three	  decades.	  In	  2014,	  the	  Chinese	  economy	  grew	  at	  a	  rate	  of	  
7.4%.	  As	  economic	  growth	  slows,	  the	  growth	  of	  disposable	  household	  income	  will	  slow	  as	  well.	  
As	  we	  argued	  in	  Section	  3C,	  the	  high	  price-­‐to-­‐income	  ratio	  among	  home	  buyers	  was	  likely	  
sustained	  by	  the	  expectation	  of	  sustained	  high	  income	  growth;	  as	  such,	  a	  significant	  decrease	  in	  
the	  expectation	  of	  income	  growth	  will	  lead	  to	  a	  commensurate	  decrease	  of	  sustainable	  price-­‐
to-­‐income	  multiples	  for	  home	  buyers.	  As	  we	  have	  shown	  in	  Section	  3,	  housing	  price	  growth	  in	  
the	  last	  decade	  substantially	  outpaced	  that	  of	  income	  growth	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities,	  but	  not	  in	  
second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities;	  thus	  a	  potential	  income	  growth	  slowdown	  is	  likely	  to	  have	  a	  more	  
dramatic	  impact	  on	  housing	  prices	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities.	  	  

                             Housing	  supply,	  however,	  is	  much	  more	  elastic	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  than	  in	  first-­‐
tier	  cities.	  The	  continued	  increase	  in	  new	  construction	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  as	  shown	  
in	  Figure	  1,	  has	  kept	  the	  housing	  price	  growth	  in	  these	  cities	  in	  line	  with	  their	  income	  growth,	  
but	  also	  poses	  an	  important	  source	  risk	  to	  the	  housing	  market	  in	  these	  cities.	  Note	  that	  new	  
construction	  is	  constrained	  by	  land	  sold	  for	  housing	  development	  and	  local	  governments	  
control	  land	  sales.	  Thus,	  risks	  from	  the	  glut	  of	  new	  supplies	  in	  second-­‐	  and	  third-­‐tier	  cities	  can	  
be	  managed	  by	  local	  governments	  if	  they	  have	  alternative	  sources	  of	  fiscal	  revenue.	  

                             Another	  near-­‐term	  risk	  factor	  for	  the	  housing	  market	  is	  demographic	  trends.	  As	  is	  well	  
known,	  25	  years	  after	  the	  initiation	  of	  the	  family	  planning	  policy,	  the	  Chinese	  population	  is	  
rapidly	  ageing	  and	  is	  expected	  to	  decline	  beginning	  in	  2030.	  However,	  the	  prime	  age	  group	  for	  
home	  buyers,	  those	  between	  30	  and	  49,	  started	  to	  decline	  for	  China	  as	  a	  whole	  in	  2005.25	  	  
Using	  the	  2000	  Chinese	  Census	  micro	  data,	  we	  find	  that	  in	  2030,	  the	  prime	  age	  population	  of	  
homebuyers	  in	  China	  will	  decline	  to	  about	  62%	  of	  the	  corresponding	  level	  in	  2000.	  Of	  course,	  
the	  ongoing	  urbanization	  in	  China	  is	  likely	  to	  draw	  a	  significant	  share	  of	  the	  rural	  population	  to	  
cities	  (see	  Figure	  2),	  and	  thus	  for	  the	  urban	  housing	  market,	  the	  overall	  demographic	  trend	  may

          	  In	  Section	  4E,	  we	  showed	  the	  average	  age	  of	  mortgage	  borrowers	  is	  the	  early	  thirties.	  	  	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    43	  
	  
not	  be	  as	  relevant.	  Ongoing	  policy	  discussions	  in	  China	  regarding	  the	  relaxation	  of	  the	  one-­‐child	  
policy,	  as	  well	  as	  a	  relaxation	  or	  even	  abolishment	  of	  the	  strict	  Hukou	  policy,	  could	  significantly	  
increase	  the	  demand	  for	  housing	  in	  the	  cities.	  Policies	  that	  relax	  the	  Hukou	  system	  may	  become	  
necessary	  to	  prevent	  the	  meltdown	  of	  the	  housing	  market	  if,	  for	  example,	  the	  economy	  and	  
income	  growth	  slow	  sharply.	  

       We	  would	  also	  like	  to	  discuss	  the	  likely	  effects	  of	  some	  of	  the	  pending	  policy	  reforms	  in	  
China	  that	  may	  have	  more	  subtle	  implications	  on	  the	  housing	  market.	  	  

       First,	  we	  consider	  the	  possible	  imposition	  of	  property	  taxes	  and	  new	  fiscal	  reform.	  Property	  
taxes	  are	  not	  presently	  assessed	  on	  homeowners	  in	  China,	  with	  the	  exceptions	  of	  Shanghai	  and	  
Chongqing,	  where	  a	  small	  property	  tax	  on	  a	  certain	  class	  of	  homes	  was	  assessed	  beginning	  in	  
January	  2011.	  In	  Shanghai,	  the	  property	  tax	  is	  currently	  at	  0.6%	  of	  the	  purchase	  price	  of	  second	  
homes,	  while	  in	  Chongqing,	  the	  property	  tax	  is	  0.5%	  of	  the	  purchase	  price	  of	  second	  homes,	  
mansions,	  and	  luxury	  apartments.	  	  The	  introduction	  of	  property	  tax	  in	  all	  cities	  is	  now	  on	  
policymakers’	  agendas.	  Part	  of	  the	  reason	  is	  a	  desire	  to	  increase	  the	  cost	  of	  speculative	  
purchases	  of	  houses,	  and	  another	  part	  is	  the	  desire	  to	  have	  a	  different	  source	  of	  revenue	  for	  
local	  government	  budgets	  that	  have,	  as	  we	  have	  shown,	  become	  increasing	  reliant	  on	  land	  sales	  
revenue.	  	  

       An	  introduction	  of	  property	  taxes	  will	  have	  several	  effects	  on	  the	  housing	  market.	  First,	  it	  
will	  make	  housing	  speculation	  less	  profitable.	  	  Speculation	  would	  remain	  profitable	  only	  if	  the	  
expected	  housing	  price	  growth	  exceeds	  the	  opportunity	  cost	  of	  funds	  used	  for	  purchasing	  the	  
house,	  plus	  the	  property	  tax	  assessment.	  If	  the	  property	  tax	  rate	  is	  chosen	  properly,	  it	  is	  
possible	  that	  it	  could	  not	  only	  deter	  new	  speculative	  demand	  for	  housing,	  but	  also	  potentially	  
drive	  current	  speculative	  holdings	  of	  homes	  to	  the	  market	  for	  sale.	  Second,	  the	  introduction	  of	  
property	  taxes,	  in	  conjunction	  with	  fiscal	  reform	  that	  provides	  local	  governments	  with	  new	  
revenue	  sources	  that	  are	  not	  tied	  to	  selling	  land,	  is	  likely	  to	  affect	  households’	  expectations	  that	  
the	  housing	  market	  is	  “too	  important	  to	  fall.”	  Absent	  such	  a	  conviction,	  the	  perceived	  risk	  
associated	  with	  housing	  investment	  would	  rise,	  reducing	  housing	  demand.	  Third,	  property	  taxes	  
and	  other	  fiscal	  reform	  will	  also	  put	  downward	  pressure	  on	  the	  price	  that	  developers	  are	  willing	  

                                                                                                                                                       44	  
	  
to	  pay	  for	  land,	  which	  in	  turn	  would	  further	  lower	  the	  cost	  of	  housing.	  All	  three	  effects	  of	  
imposing	  property	  taxes	  are	  likely	  to	  put	  downward	  pressure	  on	  the	  housing	  market.	  	  

       Another	  pending	  reform	  that	  may	  impact	  the	  housing	  market	  is	  the	  unification	  of	  the	  
administrative	  structure	  of	  the	  social	  insurance	  system.	  	  The	  current	  social	  insurance	  system	  in	  
China,	  particularly	  the	  health	  care	  and	  health	  insurance	  segments,	  is	  poorly	  designed	  to	  
facilitate	  a	  transition	  of	  housing	  stock	  from	  the	  older	  generation	  to	  the	  younger	  generation.	  
Specifically,	  most	  of	  the	  best	  hospitals	  in	  China	  are	  located	  either	  in	  Beijing	  and	  Shanghai,	  or	  in	  
a	  few	  of	  the	  provincial	  capitals,	  such	  as	  Guangzhou	  and	  Chengdu.	  More	  important,	  the	  current	  
health	  insurance	  system	  is	  mostly	  based	  on	  employment	  or	  pre-­‐retirement	  employment,	  and	  it	  
is	  implemented	  under	  a	  prefecture-­‐	  or	  county-­‐level	  planning	  framework,	  where	  the	  planning	  
units	  have	  discretion	  over	  policy	  details	  and	  are	  responsible	  for	  balancing	  their	  own	  budgets	  
(see	  Fang,	  2014,	  for	  an	  overview	  of	  the	  social	  insurance	  arrangement	  in	  China).	  Health	  
insurance	  is	  not	  accepted	  nationwide.	  This	  means	  that	  if	  retirees	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  were	  to	  
relocate	  to	  third-­‐tier	  cities,	  they	  would	  not	  only	  experience	  more	  difficulty	  in	  accessing	  the	  best	  
hospitals,	  but	  would	  also	  have	  difficulty	  in	  having	  their	  medical	  expenditures	  covered	  by	  their	  
health	  insurance.	  This	  creates	  strong	  disincentive	  for	  the	  elderly	  to	  relocate	  as	  they	  retire,	  
leading	  to	  unnecessary	  competition	  between	  the	  young	  and	  the	  old	  for	  the	  limited	  housing	  
resources	  in	  the	  first-­‐tier	  and	  some	  second	  tier	  cities.	  As	  China	  attempts	  to	  unify	  the	  
administrative	  structure	  of	  the	  social	  insurance	  system	  and	  equalize	  medical	  resources	  across	  
different	  areas,	  it	  is	  possible	  that	  retirees	  in	  first-­‐tier	  cities	  will	  relocate	  to	  retirement	  
communities	  located	  in	  cities	  that	  have	  good	  medical	  facilities,	  leaving	  limited	  housing	  
resources	  for	  the	  young,	  creating	  a	  healthy	  life-­‐cycle	  for	  first-­‐tier	  city	  residents.	  This	  is	  likely	  to	  
be	  a	  stabilizing	  force	  for	  the	  Chinese	  housing	  market.

Appendix	  A:	  Residential	  Mortgages	  in	  China	  

A.1	  Borrowing	  Requirements	  

   The	  borrower	  of	  a	  mortgage	  loan	  should	  have	  a	  stable	  source	  of	  income	  and	  a	  good	  credit	  
record,	  and	  be	  between	  18	  to	  65	  years	  of	  age.	  Generally,	  loan	  to	  value	  ratio	  should	  be	  lower	  
than	   70%,	   and	   the	   loan	   term	   should	   be	   less	   than	   30	   years.	   According	   to	   the	   requirements	  
announced	   by	   the	   China	   Banking	   Regulatory	   Commission	   (CBRC)	   in	   "Guidelines	   for	   the	   risk	  
management	  of	  real	  estate	  loans	  of	  commercial	  banks"	  in	  2004,	  a	  borrower’s	  ratio	  of	  monthly	  
mortgage	   payment	   to	   income	   should	   be	   lower	   than	   50%,	   and	   the	   ratio	   of	   monthly	   debt	  
payment	  to	  income	  should	  be	  lower	  than	  55%.	  

        In	  China,	   only	   houses	   can	   act	   as	   collateral	   for	   mortgage	  loans.	   	   	   This	   includes	   villas,	   with	   the	  
down	  payment	   ratio	   of	   a	   villa	   being	   higher	   than	   that	   of	   other	   types	   of	   houses.	   House	   age	   (from	  
its	  completion	  date)	  should	  be	  no	  more	  than	  20	  to	  30	  years,	  and	  house	  age	  plus	  the	  loan	  term	  
should	   be	   no	   more	   than	   30	   to	   40	   years.	   Different	   from	   other	   countries,	   such	   as	   the	   U.S.,	  
collateral	  of	  a	  mortgage	  loan	  has	  to	  belong	  to	  the	  borrower.	  

A.2	  Loan	  Application	  Procedure	  and	  Payments	  

      A	  mortgage	  applicant	  should	  first	  submit	  all	  required	  documents	  to	  a	  bank.	  After	  receiving	  
the	  application,	  the	  bank	  carries	  out	  an	  eligibility	  investigation.	  The	  most	  important	  factor	  for	  
the	  investigation	  is	  the	  applicant’s	  income	  and	  credit	  record.	  The	  bank	  can	  check	  an	  individual’s	  
credit	  record	  through	  the	  credit	  rating	  system	  of	  the	  People's	  Bank	  of	  China,	  which	  started	  its	  
trial	   operation	   in	   December	   2004	   and	   official	   operation	   in	   January	   2006.	   Upon	   approval,	   the	  
borrower	   signs	   a	   mortgage	   contract	   with	   the	   bank,	   and	   then	   opens	   a	   mortgage	   account	   with	  
the	   bank	   for	   making	   mortgage	   payments.	   If	   the	   loan	   term	   is	   one	   year	   or	   shorter,	   both	   principal	  
and	  interest	  must	  be	  repaid	  as	  a	  lump	  sum	  at	  maturity;	  if	  the	  loan	  term	  is	  longer	  than	  one	  year,	  
the	   loan	   may	   be	   repaid	   in	   equal	   installments	   of	   the	   principal	   plus	   interest,	   or	   in	   equal	  
installments	  of	  the	  principal.	  	  

A.3	  Mortgage	  Interest	  Rate	  

       Interest	  rates	  for	  all	  bank	  loans,	  including	  mortgage	  loans,	  are	  regulated	  by	  the	  central	  bank	  
of	  China,	  known	  as	  the	  People’s	  Bank	  of	  China	  (PBC).	  All	  banks	  need	  to	  follow	  the	  same	  lending	  
rules	   set	   by	   the	   PBC.	   The	   PBC	   regulates	   interest	   rates	   of	   mortgage	   loans	   to	   be	   a	   multiple	   of	   the	  
benchmark	   lending	   rates	   it	   sets	   for	   bank	   loans,	   which	   usually	   depend	   on	   loan	   terms.	   This	  
multiple	  has	  varied	  over	  time.	  It	  was	  0.9	  before	  August	  2006,	  0.85	  from	  August	  2006	  to	  October	  
2008,	   and	   0.7	   from	   October	   2008	   to	   March	   2010.	   After	   March	   2010,	   the	   multiple	   for	   a	   first	  

                                                                                                                                                                         46	  
	  
house	  was	  0.85,	  and	  for	  a	  second	  house	  was	  1.1.	  	  During	  our	  studied	  decade,	  the	  benchmark	  
lending	  rates	  for	  different	  maturities	  have	  stayed	  between	  4	  and	  8	  percent.	  	  	  

    An	   important	   feature	   of	   mortgage	   loans	   in	   China	   is	   that	   all	   are	   adjustable	   rate	   mortgages	  
(ARMs);	   there	   are	   no	   fixed	   rate	   mortgages.26	  	   When	   the	   PBC	   changes	   its	   benchmark	   lending	  
rates,	   interest	   rates	   of	   all	   mortgage	   loans	   are	   adjusted	   according	   to	   the	   most	   recent	   lending	  
rates.	  Except	  for	  a	  small	  number	  of	  mortgage	  loans	  that	  are	  adjusted	  in	  the	  next	  month	  or	  next	  
quarter,	  the	  majority	  of	  mortgage	  loans	  are	  adjusted	  on	  the	  first	  day	  of	  the	  next	  year.	  	  

A.4	  Mortgage	  Termination	  

       Default	  and	  full	  prepayment	  are	  two	  ways	  to	  terminate	  a	  mortgage	  contract	  during	  its	  term.	  
The	   default	   rate	   in	   China	   has	   been	   low.	   According	   to	   the	   Annual	   Report	   of	   China	   Banking	  
Regulatory	   Commission,27	  the	   ratio	   of	   non-­‐performing	   loans	   in	   residential	   mortgages	   declined	  
steadily	  from	  0.59%	  in	  2009	  to	  0.26%	  in	  2013,	  and	  the	  average	  during	  this	  5-­‐year	  period	  was	  
0.36%.28	  The	   non-­‐performing	   ratio	   in	   residential	   mortgage	   loans	   is	   much	   lower	   than	   that	   in	  
credit	   cards,	   which	   was	   on	   average	   1.59%	   during	   the	   same	   period.	   One	   important	   reason	   for	  
the	  low	  default	  rate	  in	  China	  is	  that	  all	  mortgage	  loans	  are	  recourse	  loans.	  This	  allows	  mortgage	  
lenders	   to	   recover	   losses	   from	   mortgage	   loans	   by	   collecting	   the	   borrowers’	   other	   assets.	   When	  
a	   default	   occurs	   and	   the	  value	   of	   the	  home	   value	   is	   lower	   than	   the	   loan	  balance,	   the	   mortgage	  
lender	  can	  request	  courts	  to	  sell	  the	  home	  and	  collect	  the	  borrower's	  other	  assets.	  Furthermore,	  
mortgage	  refinance,	  i.e.,	  the	  process	  of	  paying	  off	  an	  existing	  loan	  by	  taking	  a	  new	  loan,	  is	  not	  
allowed	  in	  China.29	  This	  rule	  prevents	  borrowers	  from	  using	  homes	  as	  ATMs.	  

	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	  




	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
26
  	  During	  2007	  to	  2008,	  some	  commercial	  banks	  issued	  a	  small	  number	  of	  fixed	  rate	  mortgage	  loans	  but	  stopped	  
the	  practice.

  	  A	  loan	  is	  defined	  as	  non-­‐performing	  if	  it	  is	  overdue	  by	  more	  than	  90	  days.	  	  
29
  As	  all	  mortgage	  loans	  in	  China	  have	  floating	  rates;	  decreases	  in	  interest	  rates	  do	  not	  motivate	  mortgage	  
refinancing.

For	  each	  tier	  of	  cities,	  we	  divide	  its	  annual	  flow	  of	  newly	  constructed	  residential	  housing,	  measured	  in	  square	  meters,	  
by	  its	  urban	  population	  in	  2012.	  The	  National	  Bureau	  of	  Statistics	  provides	  annual	  city-­‐level	  data	  on	  space	  of	  newly	  
constructed	  residential	  housing	  from	  2002-­‐2013	  and	  resident	  population	  from	  2005-­‐2012,	  for	  35	  large	  cities	  only.	  
These	  cities	  include	  all	  four	  tier-­‐1	  cities:	  Beijing,	  Shanghai,	  Guangzhou,	  and	  Shenzhen.	  The	  other	  31	  cities	  all	  belong	  to	  
the	  tier-­‐2	  cities	  defined	  in	  the	  paper.	  We	  use	  the	  aggregate	  of	  these	  31	  cities	  to	  compute	  the	  per	  capita	  area	  built	  for	  
tier-­‐2	  cities.	  	  We	  then	  subtract	  these	  35	  cities	  from	  the	  national	  aggregates	  on	  newly	  constructed	  urban	  housing	  and	  
urban	  population	  to	  get	  measures	  for	  tier-­‐3	  (and	  other)	  cities.	  Resident	  population	  includes	  all	  people	  residing	  six	  
months	  or	  more	  in	  the	  area	  governed	  by	  the	  city	  in	  the	  current	  year	  (in	  contrast	  to	  the	  hukou	  population).	  We	  
assume	  all	  resident	  populations	  in	  tier-­‐1	  and	  tier-­‐2	  cities	  are	  urban,	  which	  leads	  to	  a	  slight	  overestimation	  of	  urban	  
population	  in	  tier-­‐1	  and	  tier-­‐2	  cities	  and,	  consequently,	  a	  slight	  underestimation	  of	  urban	  population	  in	  tier-­‐3	  (and	  
other)	  cities.	  In	  2012,	  China	  had	  a	  total	  population	  of	  13.5	  billion,	  out	  of	  which	  7.2	  billion	  are	  urban	  and	  6.3	  billion	  are
