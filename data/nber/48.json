This material, which includes some comparisons of Egyptian costs of production with those of other countries for a number of commodities, is too extensive for that volume, in which interest is focused on the end results of the calculations. The underlying data, however, are not easily accessible: some of them took us along time to gather, and readers might want to work on the data themselves for further research in this field. We also felt that readers should be in a position to evaluate our calculations.\n\n",
