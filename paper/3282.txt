NBER Working Paper #3282
March 1990
WAS THERE A "PESO PROBLEM" IN THE U.S. TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES:
1979-1982?
ABSTRACT
During the period following October 1979 through 1982. the U.S. Federal Reserve
allowed interest rates to fluctuate widely, in contrast to its previous policy
of targeting these rates in the 197C

The policy was abandoned in 1982 in favor

of an operating procedure that reduced the variation in interest rates.

This

paper implements an estimation method to identify from the term structure of
Eurodollar returns the market's beliefs that the Fed may revert to interest rate
targeting.

The model is not rejected and gives plausible estimates of the

probability of a switch in monetary regimes.
