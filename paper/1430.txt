'Precautionary' Saving Revisited
Social Security, Individual Welfare, and the Capital Stock
ABSTRACT

This paper focuses on precautionary saving against uncertain longevity
and on the annuity insurance aspects of social security within the life—
cycle framework. The principal findings are three. First, the
evolution of social security is reviewed in response to missing markets
for providing insurance for consumption in the face of lifetime
uncertainty. A simple life—cycle model is used to show that even an
actuarially fair, fully funded social security system can reduce
national saving. Second, to the extent that the introduction of social
security reduces the size of accidental bequests, the net effect on the
consumption of subsequent generations is diminished. Finally,
consideration of the welfare gains from compulsory social security
requires an examination of the tradeoff between the benefits to early
participants from access to the annuities and the costs to generations
that follow of a lower capital stock. Across a range of parameter
values, the partial equilibrium impact of social security on consumption
is reversed. The introduction of an explicit bequest motive ivitigates
both the initial impact of social security on saving and the long—run
welfare loss from the introduction of social security.

INTRODUCTION

Discussions

of the impact of social security on saving have

extended analysis of and estimation of life—cycle models of consumption
(cf., Modigliani and Ando, 1957; Modigliani and Brumberg, 1954).1

Empirical work is usually conducted in the certainty version of the
model, wherein social security affects wealth accumulation in two ways:
(i) reducing disposable income by the amount of the tax, and
(ii) increasing lifetime resources and raising consumption over the

life

cycle to the extent that the present value of benefits exceeds the
present value of taxes paid.
The emphasis here is on precautionary saving against uncertain
longevity and on the annuity insurance aspects of social security within

the life—cycle framework. This is a departure from the literature
beginning with Feldstein's (1974) seminal paper (and the corresponding
arguments in Barro, 1974, 1978), which focuses on the impact on
consumption of the way in which social security is financed, i.e., the
degree to which an unfunded social security system decreases private

saving.2 The principal findings are three. First, the evolution of
social security is reviewed in response to missing markets for providing

insurance for consumption in the face of uncertain lifetimes. A simple
life—cycle

model is put forth in section II to show that even an

actuarially fair, fully funded social security system can reduce
individual saving by more than the tax paid.3
Second, the large
Section

partial equilibrium saving impacts

found in

II are mitigated when initial endowments are considered.

Specifically, accidental bequests, which arise in the model because of
lifetime uncertainty, provide an intergenerational link for saving

—2—

decisions.

To the extent that the introduction of social security

reduces the size of accidental bequests, the net effect of social
security on the consumption of subsequent generations is diminished.
Finally, while it is true that social security reduces individual
saving to a lesser degree in the generations after its introduction,

there is still a reduction in the aggregate capital stock in the long

run.4 Ultimately, consideration of the welfare gains from compulsory
social security requires an examination of the tradeoff between the
benefits to early participants from access to the annuities and the
costs to generations that follow of a lower capital stock.
That general equilibrium analysis is carried out in Section IV.
Across a range of parameter values, the partial equilibrium impact of

social security on per capita consumption is reversed. Consumption and
welfare of the representative individual are reduced in the new steady

state. The introduction of an explicit bequest valuation function in
Section V mitigates the initial impact of social security on saving and
reduces

the long—run welfare loss from the introduction of social

security.
Conclusions

and directions for future research are presented in

Section VI.

II.

SOCIAL SECURITY AN1) SAVING IN A LIFE-CYCLE W)DEL

A. Individual Saving Decisions
The type of precautionary saving considered here is that against

uncertain longevity. Yaari's (1965) seminal paper showed that with an
uncertain lifetime, intertemporal utility maximization can dictate

—3—
saving for the possibility of living longer than the expected lifetime

to avoid depreviation in old age.5 That excess saving can be large.
Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981, P. 379) found for a set of plausible
underlying parameter values that the present expected value of
unintended bequests represented almost 25 percent of initial wealth for
a single male aged 55.

To emphasize this point, consider the following life—cycle model.
Agents are assumed to be selfish, in that no bequests are desired; the
implications of relaxing this assumption are discussed in Section V.
The retirement age Q is taken as exogenous, and individuals live at

least Q periods. The probability of having died in the interval {O,tJ
for each t; by assumption, i is equal to zero in the interval

[O,Q]. Individuals have an expected lifetime of D years, with D' > D

being the maximum age to which one can survive.6 Individuals are
assumed to supply labor inelastically and receive a gross wage

w in

each period t during their working life; individual wages are assumed to
grow over the working period at a constant rate g.

Following Yaari (1965) and Barro and Friedman (1977), let utility

be additively separable across periods, and let U(C) be evaluated
contingent on being alive at time t. That is, the consumer's
intertemporal choice model is given by7

The extent to which uncertainty over length of life affects the
stream of consumption depends on agents' degree of relative risk
aversion (a transformation of y, the elasticity of marginal utility

function). The higher is an individual's degree of relative risk
aversion (or, equivalently, the lower is his intertemporal elasticity of
substitution in consumption), the slower will consumption grow over
time.

B.

The Introduction of Social Security
Access to fair annuity market could remove the influence of

lifetime uncertainty on consumption. Individuals could exchange a
portion of their labor income when young to smooth consumption in old

age.'° If all individuals were identical in terms of their survival
probabilities, then a competitive equilibrium would be possible. That
is, as individual deaths are presumably independent, annuities would be
actuarially fair in the competitive equilibrium.

The existence of a competitive equilibrium may be precluded by

asymmetries of information between individuals and insurers. This is,
of course, the familiar "adverse selection" phenomenon, discussed by

Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976). They found that the competitive outcome
may be inefficient, in the sense that the imposition of a common
contract in addition to the competitively supplied contracts may be

Pareto—improving. An interpretation of this compulsory additional
contract as social security has been offered by Eckstein, Eichenbaum,

and Peled (1983). There may be additional "moral hazard" or "free—
rider" barriers to the existence of an annuities market. If individuals
conjecture that the state will support them in deprivation, the need to
purchase annuities is diminished.

Public provision of the annuities through public pensions is one

possibility.- Moral hazard problems still make voluntary participation
difficult. Consider, though, a social security system of the following
form. Individuals are compelled to pay a payroll tax at rate

t on

gross wages, from which the social security system is funded. During
retirement they receive annuity benefits St in each period t until

death. The budget constraint in (2) becomes

Since w is greater than unity, the system generates an increase in

lifetime resources. Note that this increase in resources occurs even in
a system which is actuarially fair and fully funded (i.e., in which

—7—
contributions are invested and earn the market rate of return r in each

period).12 In reality, the initial cohorts participating in social
security received a rate of return greater than the actuarially fair
return

(see

Hurd and Shoven, 1983). This analysis focuses only on an

actuarially fair system to point out that the negative impact of social
security on individual saving does not hinge on such initial
transfers. 13

Table 1 shows the percentage increase in lifetime resources
generated by an actuarially fair social security system under various
assumptions about the rate of interest and the social security payroll

tax rate.'4 For example, when r = 0.06 and t =

0.10,

a 16 percent

increase in the propensity to consume out of lifetime resources is

afforded by an actuarially fair social security system. Because the
system generates an increase in lifetime consumption, individual saving
is reduced by more than the amount of the tax paid.

The existence of social security annuities does not preclude the

possibility of excess demand for old—age annuities. Suppose for example
that effective participation in the system is higher for low—income

individuals than for high—income individuals. Let w represent the
ceiling on taxable income; the growth rate of the taxable wage base and

the determination of the replacement rate are as before. The budget

The impact of social security on an

lifetime resources depends on his income. As an annuity,

social security administered in this way generates a smaller reduction
in saving for high—income people than for low—income people.

III.

SOCIAL SECURITY AND DYNAMIC WEALTH ACCUMULATION
A.

Individual Saving Behavior

We can use the derivation from the previous section of the impact

of mandatory actuarially fair social security on saving to study

individual wealth accumulation over time. For any time t, the present
value (at time 0) of an individual's accumulated stock of wealth, AUt
(i.e., the present value of the "accidental bequest" of an individual
who died in period t), can be expressed as

(9)

Ao =

(1 + r)'((l — t)w.

+ S — C.).

Wages and social security benefits are the sources of income to the

—9—
individual. Wages are zero in the interval [Q÷1, D'J, and social
security benefits are zero in the interval [0,Q]. Using the expressions

derived above for w, St and C, we can rewrite (9) as

The ratio AOt/VL tracks an individual's accumulated stock of assets

relative to lifetime earnings. In a world of no uncertainty over
longevity, AOt/VL is simply a function of age, and the results of the
basic life—cycle model are reproduced, as long as the present values of

social security contributions and benefits are equal. With lifetime
uncertainty, an actuarially fair social security system generates an
increase in individual lifetime resources, and lifetime consumption

rises. Much of this increase in consumption comes during an
individual's working life, as the need to save for retirement is

reduced. Depending on risk aversion, while retirement consumption is
higher in the presence of social security, dissaving in retirement is
likely to be less than in the certainty case.'5
The problem becomes more complicated when the insurance coverage

by social security is not the same across individuals. Suppose
that there is a ceiling on the level of earnings against which

provided

payroll tax rates and replacement rates are calculated. If

that

w in period 0 and grows at the same rate as the wage base, then the

effective tax rate is not t,

From equation (11), the

ratio of wealth to lifetime earnings should rise with the level of

lifetime earnings, though at a decreasing rate.16 This nonlinearity of

— 11 —

saving rates with respect to lifetime earnings occurs in the absence of
any explicit bequest motive.

B. Long—Run Effects on Individual Saving
Given uncertainty over length of life, an actuarially fair social
security system can reduce individual saving by more than the amount of

the taxes paid. For plausible underlying assumptions ahout individual
discount rates, survival probabilities, and the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution in consumption, the magnitude of that reduction is

substantial. The partial equilibrium conclusion is clear ——

estimates

of the reduction in individual saving brought about by social security
that focus only on the extent to which the system delivers a present
value of anticipated benefits greater than the present value of taxes

paid underestimate the true impact. Before discussing gereral
equilibrium interpretations of this finding (in the sense that the wage
rate and interest rate are endogenous and respond to changes in the
saving rate), it is important to address the issue raised in the
simulation exercises of the links among generations provided by
accidental bequests.

An initial bequest from an

"early

death" of one's parent raises the

beneficiary's consumption relative to lifetime earnings. In the model,
the size of that bequest depends on the testator's coverage by social

security and his age at death. By facilitating greater consumption out
of lifetime earnings, social security reduces the accidental bequest.
On that account, the initial resources available to the heir (and

consumption when young) are lower. Even within the partial equilibrium
analysis, the impact of social security on the consumption and saving
patterns of individuals in a given generation depends on the balance
between the effective increase in lifetime resources made possible by

— 12 —

access to a fair annuity and the reduction in inheritances because of
that impact on the saving of the previous generations.'7
To see this more clearly, note that given an average age of death
of D, an individual testator's expected bequest relative to lifetime
resources aD is

In general, the net increment to lifetime resources made possible
by social security depends on the age at which the parent died

(magnitude of the unplanned bequest). The role of family mortality
history is important here, as individuals whose progenitors all died
early will receive large bequests relative to those whose parent lived a
long time.

Members of the first generation to participate in the social
security system benefit in two respects, as their lifetime resources are
augmented both by the bequests from the (uninsured) previous generation
and the gains from participation in the social security annuity

system. The reduced value of accidental bequests permits smaller
consumption gains for subsequent generations. While it is true that
social security reduces individual saving to a lesser degree in the

— 13 —

generations after its introduction, there is still a reduction in the
long—run capital stock. Ultimately, to consider the potential welfare
gains from compulsory pensions, the tradeoff between the benefits to
early participants from access to the annuities and the costs to
generations that follow of a lower capital stock must be examined.

IV. GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SECURITY ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

The partial equilibrium effects of social security on individual
saving will be dampened

in a general equilibrium analysis of the impact

on aggregate capital formation. The reduction in individual wealth
accumulation brought about by social security will induce changes in
factor returns, exhibiting both income and substitution effects on

consumption. A higher interest rate decreases the present value of
lifetime resources; in addition, a higher rate of interest reduces the
price of consumption in old age.'9
The following simple model of production and factor prices is used
to examine the impact of savings against lifetime uncertainty on

aggregate saving. Output Q is assumed to be produced according to a
Cobb—Douglas production function in capital K and effective labor L; the

capital share is equal to .

Again, labor L is inelastically supplied,

and labor—augmenting technical change occurs at a constant rate g, so
that

(14)

L = (1+g)

L.

Hence output is determined by

— 14 —

(15)

Q =

L1

K

or, using lower—case letters to denote variables in intensive form

(16)

q =

k.

Factor markets are assumed to be competitive, so that capital and labor
are paid their marginal products, i.e.,

ci —1

(17)

r ak

(18)

w = (1—o.)k.

and

The work force grows at a constant rate n, producing a total
effective growth rate of n + g +

ng.

Aggregate saving SS is assumed to

be equivalent to the increase in the capital stock; that is, the

depreciation rate is set equal to zero. The capital stock is assumed to
result from individual saving and assets of the funded social security
system.

20

We can now solve for the steady—state values of aggregate
consumption, the aggregate capital stock, and the interest rate.
Aggregate consumption out of labor income in any period j in the absence
of social security can be written as

The steady state can be solved for as follows. A guess is made for
k. Solutions for r and w are then generated from the marginal
productivity conditions to produce individual consumption and wealth
profiles. The resulting aggregate consumption arid capital stock in
intensive form are compared with the initial guess, and iteration
proceeds until convergence is reached.

To quantify the impact of social security on aggregate consumption,
the capital stock, and the welfare of a representative individual, the

general equilibrium system described above can be simulated for

plausible parameter values. In the Cobb—Douglas production function,
is set equal to --.

The following relationships among the parameters

of the individual's optimization

problem are assumed: r > g, r > 5, and

In addition, the interest rate is assumed to exceed the growth rate of
the economy; i.e., r > n+g+ng.
n = .01 and 6 =

0.03.

22

g is assumed to equal 0.02, while

21
> 0.

— 16 —

There is some evidence on the value of y in the literature. In
their study of household portfolio allocation, Friend and Blume (1975)
estimated the coefficient of relative risk aversion to be in excess of
2.0, implying a value of y of at most —

1.0.

Farber's (1978) estimation

of preferences of United Mine Workers from collective bargaining
agreements yielded estimates of the coefficient of relative risk

aversion of 3.0 and 3.7. Hansen and Singleton (1983) found estimates of
the coefficient of relative risk aversion between 0 and 2.0. Here,
three alternative values of i will be used: —1.0, —3.0, and —5.0.
Table 2 below describes the no—social—security steady states under
the three values of y, presenting the interest rate (r), output per
worker (q), consumption per head (c), capital per worker (k), and the
saving rate (s/q).

Because of the risk of living longer than expected and facing
deprivation in retirement, substantial unplanned bequests are added on

average to the capital stock. The capital stock is higher in the more
risk—averse (y = —3, y = —5) economies because of the higher average

accidental bequests. As result, the interest rate is lower and per
capita consumption is higher in those cases.

As in the discussion in Section II, the introduction of an
actuarially fair social security system permits an increase in

individual lifetime consumption. The resulting increase in consumption
lowers the capital stock, raising the interest rate and lowering the

wage rate in the new steady state. For the three cases considered here,
with an assumed tax rate t5 of 0.10, social security initially increases
the rate of consumption by 16.7 percent when y = — 1.0,
when y = — 3.0, and by 17.8 percent when y = — 5.0.23

by 17.5 percent
In Table 3 below,

we consider the impact of introducing an actuarially fair, fully funded

social security system (when t = 0.10) on the steady state values of
the variables described in Table 2.24

Note that in all cases the introduction of the social security
annuity system leads to a significant reduction in the saving rate and

the aggregate capital stock. The reductions in the capital stock are
approximately half the value of the partial equilibrium reductions. As
pointed out earlier, while social security permits higher consumption
out of lifetime resources, intergenerational transfers (bequests) are
lowered, and the increase in the interest rate and decrease in the wage

rate work to lower lifetime resources. Though the rate of consumption
increases more initially as y gets smaller, the greater initial increase
in r is counterbalanced by a greater fall in w, narrowing the gap among

the cases. In the results presented here, per capita consumption
declined because of the fall in output. These losses in consumption per
head cannot, however, be interpreted as a measure of a change in steady—
state welfare, for which the appropriate concept is the utility of a
representative individual.

The lifetime utility of a representative individual entering at
time j

(denoted V-) is

Differences

in welfare can be compared across steady states by

computing the percentage change in lifetime earnings (or w0, given g and
r) that would be necessary to yield the level of utility achieved in the
new steady state. That is, equation (24) below must solved for A,, which
serves as a measure of the difference In welfare between the two steady
states.

(25)

V(w01(1+A,),r',t') = V(w02, r2, t2).

Following the earlier experiment, we consider the introduction of
social security with t5 = 0.10 for the three cases
of y

= — 1.0, y = —3.0, y = — 5.0. The value of A is summarized in Table

4 below. In all cases, the reduction in the capital stock from the
imposition of the social security program leads to welfare losses in the

The results in Table 4 indicating that the introduction of a
funded, actuarially fair social security system reduces steady—state

welfare are subject to some important qualifications. First, the
analysis in Sections II — IV assumed the absence of any explicit bequest

motive. For any given set of parameter values, a positive bequest
motive would raise individual saving rates and mitigate the impact of
social security on the propensity to consume of the initial generation

and of generations to come. Second, the model has assumed complete
failure in the provision of private annuities. Finally, real—world
limitations on borrowing against future earnings dampen the impact of

social security on lifetime consumption. The first of these points is

considered in detail in the next section. The remaining two are
discussed briefly in Section VI.

V.

BEQUESTS AND THE LIFE—CYCLE GROWTH W)DEL
A.

Individual Saving Behavior

The theoretical and simulation results presented heretofore have
ignored the existence of explicit bequest motives. Some recent analyses
have suggested, however, that bequests and other intergenerational
transfers may account for a significant portion of the capital stock
(see for example Kotlikoff and Summers, 1981).

In the context of social

security, the discussion of bequests has centered around the question of
whether intergenerational transfers are adjusted in response to
liabilities placed on future generations by an unfunded system (see
Feldstein, 1974; Barro, 1974, 1978).

— 22 —

Again, to focus on the insurance features of social security, the
emphasis here is on a funded, actuarially fair system. That individuals
might gain utility from leaving a bequest (to provide capital to heirs
or for prestige or security) mitigates the impact of social security
annuities on life—cycle saving.

Consider the basic individual optimization problem from before with
the addition of a bequest motive of the following form

(26)

This

bequest framework is used by Seidman (1984) in his analysis of

the transition from capital taxation to consumption taxation in a life—

cycle growth model.25 Seidman points out that a given steady state with
a particular saving rate can be generated by different combinations of a

subjective discount rate and bequest motive. The more powerful is the
bequest motive, the greater is the discount rate parameterizing the

initial steady state. If r > S, the gain in lifetime resources offered
by access to the social security annuity system is smaller than in the
no—bequest case.

Bequests and General Equilibrium Impacts of Social Security on the

Capital Stock
As in the previous section, suppose that the aggregate production
function is Cobb—Douglas, with a capital share of a.

We can now solve

for the steady—state values of aggregate consumption, the aggregate

capital stock, and factor prices. Aggregate consumption in any period j
in the absence of social security can be written as

Two countervailing effects surface in examining the impact of
social security on steady—state consumption and welfare in the bequest

case. In the presence of the bequest motive modeled here, the increase
in consumption accompanying a social security system of a given size is

not as great as in the no—bequest case. However, because the capital—
labor ratio is higher in the bequest regime, the interest rate is lower,
and the gain from participating in a social security system of a given
size (i.e., a given t5)

is

greater (because w is greater).

The results from introducing an actuarially fair, funded social
security system with t = 0.10 are displayed in Table 6; again only the
case of y = —1.0 is considered. The same five bequest regimes as in

Table 5 are considered. For the first four cases, the capital—reducing
(output—reducing) effect of social security still outweighs the
consumption—increasing effect; per capita consumption falls in the new

steady state in each case. As expected, larger values of 8 are
associated with smaller declines in consumption per head, as the impact
of the social security system on the long—run capital stock is

smaller. In the fifth case, consumption increases as a result of the
introduction of social security.

The associated welfare changes are calculated as in the no—bequest

case and are reported in Table 7. While the costs are lower than in the
no—bequest case, the bequest motive in most cases did not eliminate the

long—run cost of the introduction of the system. The only gain came in
the 8 = 25 case.

CONCLUSIONS AND EXTENSIONS

Assessing

the impact of social security and private pensions on

individ.al wealth accumulation is important for many analyses of
welfare, capital formation, and equity in the distributions of income

and wealth. Previous research efforts along the lines of Feldstein
(1974) have addressed the funding Status of social security and

pensions. The focus here is on insurance features of pension annuities
with respect to the problem of uncertainty over length of life.
The first part of the paper considers the introduction of social
security into an economy with market failure in the provision of private

annuities. The principal findings are three. First, in such a world,
even an actuarially fair, fully funded social security system can
substantially reduce individual saving, though individual welfare is

— 30 —

initially

improved. Hence, partial equilibrium estimates of the impact

of social security on saving relying solely on the extent to which
individuals earn a more than fair return on social security are
underestimates of the true effect.

Second, the partial equilibrium impact of social security annuities
on non—pension saving is reduced when initial endowments are

considered. For example, to the extent that the introduction of social
security reduces the size of accidental bequests, the net effect of
social security on the consumption of succeeding generations is
mitigated.

Third, general equilibrium considerations, namely the endogeneity
of factor returns, reverse the partial equilibrium impact in the new

steady state. In the simulation exercises presented in Section IV, the
accompanying reduction in the capital stock and output are sufficient to

reduce per capita consumption and individual welfare. For plausible
parameter values, the reduction in welfare is on the order of nine
percent of lifetime resources.

The introduction in Section V of a bequest valuation into the life—
cycle model produced smaller initial impacts on consumption than in the

no—bequest case. While steady—state welfare is still reduced by the
introduction in social security, the loss is smaller than in the no—

bequest case. For very high weights on bequests, a small welfare gain
occurs as the result of introducing social security.
Three extensions of the models presented here are left as tasks for

future research. First, additional research on private annuity markets
is needed to determine the actual extent of market failure. As
discussed elsewhere (see Hubbard, 1984), links between private pensions

and social security are important in this context.26 That annuity

— 31 —

markets are extremely imperfect in the real world need not be evidence
of a severe market failure, as individuals have some control over their
participation in private pensions either explicitly (for participants in
defined—contribution plans) or implicitly (through choice of

employer). To the extent that individuals adjust their pensions for
variation in social security annuities, the effective annuity market may

be quite large. The magnitude of that adjustment nust be resolved
empirically.27 A second and related point is that, given the current
political environment, introducing uncertainty over future social

security benefits may be appropriate. That uncertainty would modify the
wealth impacts derived here.

A third extension is to consider the market imperfection introduced

by restrictions on borrowing against future earnings.28 Young workers
are hardest hit by this restriction, as their current earnings are below

their lifetime average earnings. If the liquidity constraint is then
binding in their life—cycle optimization, they Will consume all of their
after—tax income; that is, social security taxes reduce consumption one

for one. Hence, reducing payroll taxes during youth would raise
lifetime utility, even if the reduction were compensated (in the sense
of raising required contributions later in the life cycle).

The debate over the influence of pensions on individual saving
brings together questions of consumer choice under uncertainty and the

effectiveness of fiscal policy. Researching the relationships among
social security, private pensions, annuity markets, and bequests
facilitates close empirical scrutiny of models of individual and
aggregate saving, permitting consideration of the welfare effects of

compulsory pensions. In addition, while this paper has concentrated on
annuity insurance, similar approaches could be used to study the impacts
of other social insurance programs on national

saving.

FOOTNOTES

'Empirical tests of the life—cycle model under certainty have tested the
hypothesis of a hump—shaped wealth—age profile, but results have by
no means unambiguously validated the model. See for example White
(1978), Mirer (1979), and Kurz (1981). Even after controlling for
the effects of permanent income, Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1981),
Diamond and Hausman (1982), King and Dicks—Mireaux (1982), and
Hubbard (1983) found results only mildly supportive of the basic
theory. Other studies have addressed the possibility of other
motives for saving. Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) rejected the
ability of the life—cycle model to explain wealth accumulation in
the U. S., putting forth a major role for bequests.
2Earlier studies for private pensions include those of Cagan (1965),
Katona (1964), and Munnell (1974). Feldstein's results have by no
means gone unchallenged; see for example Leimer and Lesnoy (1982)
and the reply in Feldstein (1982). Microeconomic (cross—section)
evidence has generally been supportive of the proposition that
social security has reduced individual saving. See Feldstein and
Pellechio (1979), Kotlikoff (1979b), Blinder, Gordon, and Wise
(1981), Diamond and Hausman (1982), King and Dicks—Mireaux (1982),
and Hubbard (1983).

3Hence, previous partial equilibrium estimates of the impact of social
security on saving drawn solely from consideration of the intergenerational wealth transfer at the introduction of the system are,
if anything, too small. Abel (1983) takes up the intergenerational
consequences of this point in a two—period overlapping—generations
model, with the implication that the insurance features of social
security may reduce inequality in the distribution of wealth.
4Another discussion of this point can be found in Kotlikoff, Shoven, and
Spivak (1983).
5The precise direction of the influence of this uncertainty for saving
is unclear. Heightened uncertainty over the length of life may lead
to more saving (because of a longer than expected lifetime) or to
less saving (to maintain present consumption). In the argument of
Yaari (1965), two individuals with identical tastes, income, and
investment opportunities are compared. The difference between them
is that one lives T periods for certain while the other faces an
uncertain lifetime of t periods, up to a maximum of T periods.
Given a shorter expected life, uncertainty over length of life
unambiguously leads to increased initial consumption. Champernowne
(1969) and Levhari and Mirman (1977), on the hand, consider two
agents with identical expected lives, but differing in the
distribution of length of life. In either case, the impact of
uncertainty over length of life on wealth accumulation of a risk—
averse individual is ambiguous and depends on the parameters of the
model.

— 33 —

6That is, D is just the weighted average of the years t in (Q+1, D'),
with weights 1Pt for each t.
7Discussions of the lifetime utility function can be found in Strotz
(1956) and Atkinson (1971).
8lndividuals will die on average prior to reaching age D', but the
lifetime budget constraint reflects the possibility that the
Individual will live through D'. In no case can the present value
of consumption exceed lifetime resources. The problem is simplified
here by making lifespan (and earnings) in the interval (0, Q)
nonstochastic.
9This formulation of the utility function is used by Summers (1981),
Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981), Kotlifkoff and Summer (1981), Evans
(1983), and Seidman (1984). As noted by Evans (1983), it is the
only additive utility function consistent with the original
homogeneity hypothesis of Modigliani and Brumberg (1954).
10This role of annuities as a mechanism for sharing uncertainty about
longevity is an integral part of Diamond's (1977) evaluation of the
social security system, in which he focuses on the absence of
complete markets for such contracts. Merton (1983) considers
Pareto—improving social security programs in an intertemporal model
in which human capital is not tradeable.

"Previous work in this area in the context of pensions includes the
contributions of Davies (1981) and Sheshinski and Weiss (1981).
Davies used a life—cycle model under uncertain lifetime to address
the phenomenon of slow dissaving in retirement. The presence of
pensions in his simulation model (using Canadian data) reduced, but
by no means eliminated, the effect of uncertainty on retirement
consumption. In the model of Sheshinski and Weiss, the ultimate
impact of social security on saving depends on the availability of a
private annuity market. They found that, at the optimum, Yaari's
(1965) result holds, namely that private savings are reserved for
bequests, while social security benefits are used to finance
retirement consumption.
'2The actuarially fair benefit is constructed with respect to economy—
wide survival probabilities. It is true that individuals who
believe they will die "young" will want to purchase less than the
"average optimal" amount of social security annuities, while those
who expect to live a long time will want more. Both groups are
better off, however, with the mandatory social security than without
it, since in its absence, adverse selection is assumed to foreclose
the possibility of a market of private annuities. A discussion of
the potential separating equilibria in the private provision of
annuities which may arise after the imposition of mandatory social
security is given Eckstein, Eichenbaum, and Peled (1983).

— 34 —

'3LJncertairity

over future social security benefits would mitigate the
effect shown here. Watson (1982) discusses the influence of
uncertainty over benefits in assessing the impact of social security
on saving. Merton, Bodie, and Marcus (1984) show that many private
pension integration arrangements remove much of this uncertainty.

retirement age of 65 was assumed. Probabilities for survival were
taken from Faber (1982).
15This effect is most pronounced in the absence of explicit capital
market restrictions. With no initial endowment (and, hence, binding
restrictions on the nomarketability of social security when young),
relative impacts on "working—period" and "retirement—period"
consumption will depend on the relationship of the individual's
actual and optimal tax rate (participation). The importance of
(accidental) bequests as intergenerational links will be discussed
later.

'6Thjs nonlinearity has surfaced in some recent studies of the impact of
social security on saving. See for example Diamond and Hausman
(1982) and Hubbard (1983).
'71n a world with capital market restrictions, then, a social security
system of this type may increase saving, since received initial
bequests are more liquid than anticipated social security
benefits. The impact of social security on intergenerational
transfers is an important component of the system's net effect on
individual saving.
'8The implicit assumption, of course, is that the parent dies at the
beginning of the child's (optimizing) life, age twenty here. This
assumption is made to highlight the point that the existence of
social security for the previous generation mitigates the impact of
the present generation's participation in social security on its own
wealth accumulation. More general assumptions about the timing of a
testator's death would complicate expressions like (13) in the text,
but the qualitative point would remain.

'9Kotlikoff (1979a) used a life—cycle model with certain longevity and a
Cobb—Douglas production technology to consider the general
equilibrium impact of a pay—as—you—go social security system. For
plausible parameter values, he found that the positive lifetime
wealth increment traceable to social security (because of the growth
of the wage base) caused a 20—percent reduction in the steady—state
capital stock. While this effect is certainly substantial, it is
roughly half of his calculated partial equilibrium effect, which is
directly related to the excess of the present value of benefits over
the present value of payroll contributions. Kotlikoff's analysis
also incorporates the influence of social security on retirement
age, which is taken as exogenous here. To the extent that social
security lowers the desired retirement age, the partial equilibrium
wealth replacement effect of social security on saving is dampened.

— 35

—

20Hence non—social—security government saving is zero, and no role for
debt policy exists. Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983) discuss the
importance of the stance of debt policy in assessing transitions
between fiscal regimes.
21AS in Table 1, survival probabilities are taken from Faber. For a
more complete discussion of the implications of the choice of
parameter values, see Levhari and Nirman (1977) or Davies (1981).
22Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) report that annual growth rates of
productivity (real GNP per man—hour) and population in the U. S.
during the twentieth century have been 2.2 percent and 1.4 percent,
respectively.

23Note that the consumption increase is higher in the case of risk
aversion. The calculation proceed aas follows. When
= —1.0, w = 2.677; when y = — 3.0, w = 2.747;
when
= — 5.0, w = 2.784. The gains are evaluated as t(w—l) as
described in Section II.

24Bequests are incorporated as follows. Using information on
p(t= Q-I-1,...,D'), a distribution of bequests is generated.
All
individuals receive the weighted average bequest regardless of their
particular family mortality history. The implicit assumption is
that individual bequests are taxed away by the government and
distributed lump sum to individuals.
25Clearly other bequest formulations outside the infinite horizon
optimization in Barro (1974) are available. Evans (1983), for
example, considers two alternatives: (i) individuals pass on a
bequest related by the steady—state growth rate to initial
inheritances or (ii) both inheritances and bequests are invariant
to interest rate movments. In Seidinan's certain lifetime model,
is equivalent to the ratio of the bequest to consumption in the last
period of life.
26To the extent that high—income individuals are constrained to less
than their desired participation in social security, there is excess
demand for social security annuities. Adverse selection and the
possibility of multiple insurance still render unlikely the
provision of such annuities by competitive insurance companies.
Employer—sponsored private pensions may act to fill this gap.
Employers are likely to have better information on individual
workers' life expectancies than would a disinterested insurance
company. Second, by definition, such annuities can only be
purchased at an individual's place of work; multiple insurance is
not possible. Pauly (1974) and Wilson (1977) discuss certain
situations in which private market equilibria might occur after a
compulsory insurance program is imposed.
271n addition, imperfect annuity arrangements may be present at the
level of the family (see for example Kotlikoff, Shoven, and Spivak,
1983). Given any of these modifications, the partial equilibrium
impact of the capital stock of introducing actuarially fair social

— 36 —

security

annuities is mitigated. The point remains, however, that
the impact of social security on individual consumption in the new
steady state will differ from that on initial participants.
28Hayashi (1982) found that approximately 20 percent of all consumption
is accounted for by such liquidity constrainted individuals. Flavin
(1984) found that the estimate of the marginal propensity to consume
is affected dramatically by the inclusion of proxies for liquidity
constraints, suggesting that liquidity constraints are an important
part of the observed excess sensitivity of consumption to current
income.
