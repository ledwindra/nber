Financial Integration: A New Methodology and an Illustration
Robert P. Flood and Andrew K. Rose
NBER Working Paper No. 9880
July 2003
JEL No. G14
ABSTRACT
This paper develops a simple new methodology to test for asset integration and applies it
within and between American stock markets. Our technique is tightly based on a general
intertemporal asset-pricing model, and relies on estimating and comparing expected risk-free rates
across assets. Expected risk-free rates are allowed to vary freely over time, constrained only by the
fact that they are equal across (risk-adjusted) assets. Assets are allowed to have general risk
characteristics, and are constrained only by a factor model of covariances over short time periods.
The technique is undemanding in terms of both data and estimation. We find that expected risk-free
rates vary dramatically over time, unlike short interest rates. Further, the S&P 500 market seems to
be well integrated, and the NASDAQ is generally (but not always) integrated. However, the
NASDAQ is poorly integrated with the S&P 500.

1: Defining the Problem
The objective of this paper is to propose and implement an intuitive and simple-to-use
measure of asset-market integration. What does asset-market integration mean? We adopt the
view that financial markets are integrated when assets are priced by the same stochastic discount
rate. More precisely, we define security markets to be integrated if all assets priced on those
markets satisfy the pricing condition:

p tj = Et ( m t+1 x tj+1 )

(1)

where: p tj is the price at time t of asset j, Et () is the expectations operator conditional on
information available at t, mt +1 is the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (MRS), for
income accruing in period t+1 (also interchangeably known as the discount rate, stochastic
discount factor, marginal utility growth, pricing kernel, and zero-beta return), and xtj+1 is income
received at t+1 by owners of asset j at time t (the future value of the asset plus any dividends or
coupons). We rely only on this standard and general intertemporal model of asset valuation; to
our knowledge this Euler equation is present in all equilibrium asset-pricing models.
Our object of interest in this study is mt +1 , the marginal rate of substitution, or, more
precisely, estimates of the expected marginal rate of substitution, Et mt+1 . The MRS is the
unobservable DNA of intertemporal decisions; characterizing its distribution is a central task of
economics and finance. The discount rate ties pricing in a huge variety of asset markets to
peoples’ saving and investment decisions. The thrust of this paper is to use asset prices and
payoffs to characterize important aspects of its distribution.

1

The substantive point of equation (1) is that all assets in a market share the same marginal
rate of substitution. There is no asset-specific MRS in an integrated market, and no marketspecific MRS when markets are integrated with each other. Learning more about the MRS is of
intrinsic interest, and has driven much research (e.g., Hansen and Jagannathan, 1991, who focus
on second moments). Measures of the expected MRS also lead naturally to an intuitive test for
integration. In this paper, we propose and implement such a simple test for the equality of Et mt+1
across sets of assets. This is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for market integration.

2: Methodology
We use the fact that in an integrated market, the MRS prices all assets held by the
marginal asset holder. Indeed what we mean by asset market integration is that the same MRS
prices all the assets. In other words, if we could extract mt +1 (or rather, its expectation)
independently from a number of different asset markets, they should all be the same if those
markets are integrated. As Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) show, there may be many stochastic
discount factors consistent with any set of market prices and payoffs; hence our focus on the
expectation of MRS, which is unique.
Consider a generic identity related to (1):

p tj = Et ( mt+1 x tj+1 ) = COV t ( mt+1 , xtj+1 ) + Et (mt +1 ) Et ( x tj+1 ).

(2)

where COVt () denotes the conditional covariance operator. It is useful to rewrite this as

x tj+1 = −[1 / Et (m t +1 )]COV t ( mt +1 , x tj+1 ) + [1 / Et ( m t+1 )] ptj + ε t j+1 ,

2

or

x tj+1 = δ t ( p tj − COV t ( mt +1 , xtj+1 )) + ε t j+1

(3)

where δ t ≡ 1 / Et ( mt+1 ) and ε tj+1 ≡ xtj+1 − Et ( xtj+1 ) , a prediction error.
We then impose two restrictions:

1) Rational Expectations: ε tj+1 is assumed to be white noise, uncorrelated with information
available at time t, and
2) Covariance Model: COV t ( m t+1 , xtj+1 ) = β 0j + Σ i β i j f i, t , for the relevant sample,

where: β 0j is an asset-specific intercept, β i j is a set of I asset-specific factor coefficients and f i ,t
a vector of time-varying factors.
With our two assumptions, equation (3) becomes a panel estimating equation. We
exploit cross-sectional variation to estimate {δ } , the coefficients of interest that represent the
risk-free return and are time varying but common to all assets. These estimates of the MRS are
the focus of our study. We use time-series variation to estimate the asset-specific “fixed effects”
and factor loadings {β } , coefficients that are constant across time. Intuitively, these coefficients
are used to account for asset-specific systematic risk (the covariances).
Estimating (3) for a set of assets j=1,…,J0 and then repeating the analysis for the same
period of time with a different set of assets j=1,…,J1 gives us two sets of estimates of {δ } , a
time-series sequence of estimated discount rates. These can be compared directly, using
conventional statistical techniques, either one by one, or jointly. Under the null hypothesis of
market integration, the two sets of {δ } coefficients are equal.

3

Discussion
We make only two assumptions; both are conventional in the literature, though we rely
on them less than most of the literature. It seems reasonable to assume that expectations are
rational for financial markets, at least in our limited sense that asset-pricing errors are not ex ante
predictable at high frequencies. Our assumption that the asset-specific covariances (of payoffs
with the MRS) are either constant or depend on a small number of factors is more controversial,
but standard practice. Rather than develop our own factor model, we rely on the well-known
three-factor model famously deployed by Fama and French (1996). We defend it on two
grounds. First, in applications we maintain the covariance model for only two months at a time
(though we have tried shorter periods with similar results); Fama and French assumed that the
same model worked well for thirty years. Second, our results are insensitive to the exact factor
model. If our technique were sensitive to the factors used to model {δ } , then the measure would
be no more useful than any of the individual factor models. Indeed, if the measure were factormodel sensitive, it would be preferable to use the factor model itself as the object of
measurement. Nevertheless we stress that we must rely on some model of covariances.
While we focus on (3), there are other moments that would help characterize the MRS,
{δ } ; see e.g., Hansen and Jagannathan (1991). We concentrate on this one for four reasons.

First, as the first moment it is the natural place to check first. Second, it is simple to estimate.
Third, our estimates and results are robust to the factor model that conditions the measurements.
Finally, the measurements are discriminating for market integration, yet they confirm our prior
beliefs and previous research (e.g., Chen and Knez, 1995). In the examples below, our measure
never rejects internal market integration for portfolios of S&P stocks priced in the NYSE and

4

seldom rejects for portfolios priced on the NASDAQ, but rejects strongly – by an order of
magnitude – integration between NYSE and NASDAQ portfolios.
Our methodology has a number of strengths. First, it is based on a general intertemporal
theoretical framework, unlike other measures of asset integration such as stock market
correlations (see the excellent discussion in e.g., Adam et. al. 2002). Second, standard assetpricing models are completely consistent with our methodology, and the exact model does not
seem to be important in practice. We use the Fama-French workhorse (which subsumes the
CAPM), but find that our results are insensitive to the exact choice of model. Third, we do not
need to model the MRS directly. The MRS need not be determined uniquely, so long as its
expectation is unique. Fourth, our strategy requires only two assumptions; we need not assume
e.g., complete markets, homogeneous investors, or that we can model “mimicking portfolios”
well. Fifth, the technique requires only accessible and reliable data on asset prices, payoffs, and
time-varying factors. Sixth, the methodology can be used at very high frequencies and at low
frequencies as well. Seventh, the technique can be used to compare expected discount rates
across many different classes of assets including domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, and
commodities. Next, the technique is easy to implement and can be applied with standard
econometric packages; no specialized software is required. Finally, the technique is focused on
an intrinsically interesting object, the expected marginal rate of substitution.

3: Relationship to the Literature
The literature is clear that asset markets are integrated when identical cash flows are
priced equally across markets (e.g., Adam et. al., 2002 and Cochrane, 2001). This is the assetmarket version of economists’ trusty “Law of One Price.” But since no two different assets have

5

identical cash flows, the integration definition must be extended to be useful. The standard holds
two asset markets to be integrated when risks in those markets are shared completely and priced
identically. One way to make this definition operational requires identifying the relevant risks.
Roll and Ross (1980) recognized the dependence of integration measures on risk identification.
They tested asset integration using the argument that two portfolios are integrated only if their
implied risk-less returns are the same; our test is similar to theirs in spirit. This simple
observation is powerful because it invokes the cross-sectional dimension where every asset in an
integrated market implies the same risk-free return.
The literature on asset-market integration has grown along two branches. The first
branch, based on parametric asset-pricing models, has been surveyed by Adams et. al. (2002),
Cochrane (2001), and Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997). Along this branch, a parametric
discount-rate models to used to price two asset portfolios. Pricing errors are compared across
portfolios. If the portfolios are integrated, the pricing errors should not be systematically
identifiable with the portfolios in which they originate. Roll and Ross (1980) tested market
integration this way using an arbitrage pricing theory model, and a large literature has followed.
The second branch of literature grows from the work of Hansen and Jagannathan
(1991) and is represented by Chen and Knez (1995) and Chabot (2000). Along this branch, data
from each market are used to characterize the set of stochastic discount factors that could have
produced the observed data. Testing for integration across markets involves measuring the
distance between admissible MRS sets, and asking if, and by how much, they overlap.
Our work rests on the first branch, since we use parametric models to condition our
estimation. It differs from previous work in four ways.

6

First, we diverge from the finance profession in treating {β } as a set of nuisance
coefficients. Rather than being of intrinsic interest to us, they are required only to clear the way
to produce estimates of the MRS.
Next, we do not measure integration by the cross-sectional pricing errors produced by a
particular mode; this approach seems relatively non-specific and model-dependent. Instead we
measure integration by the implied first moment of the stochastic discount rate (MRS). The
condition we study, therefore, is a necessary condition for integration. Studying it will be
valuable only if it is a discriminating condition; it turns out to be so.
Third, parametric pricing models are often estimated with long data spans and are thus
sensitive to parameter instability in time series long enough for precise estimation (e.g., Fama
and French (1996); an excellent discussion is provided by Cochrane, 2001). We minimize (but
do not avoid completely) the instability problem by concentrating attention on a parameter that is
conditionally invariant to time-series instability. The measure we use is a free parameter,
constant across assets but unconstrained across time. Our measure is therefore basically crosssectional, that we estimate precisely using a short time-series dimension.
Finally, we do not assume that (3) holds for the bond market, or that the bond market is
integrated with other asset markets. When applied to a bond without nominal risk (e.g., a
treasury bill), equation (1) implies

1= Et (mt+1 (1+i t ))

(1’)

where: i t is a risk-less nominal interest rate, and mt +1 is a nominal MRS. The tradition inside
finance is to assume that the MRS pricing bonds is the same for all bonds, and identical to that

7

pricing all stocks (and other assets). If we make this assumption, δ t ≡ 1 / Et (mt +1 ) = (1 + i t ) .
We do not impose this assumption; rather we test it (and reject) it.

4: Empirical Implementation
We begin by estimating a model with asset-specific intercepts and the three time-varying
factors used by Fama and French (1996). In practice, we divide through by lagged prices (and
redefine residuals appropriately):

x tj+1 / ptj−1 = δ t (( ptj / ptj−1 ) + β 0j + β 1j f 1,t + β 2j f 2, t + β 3j f 3,t ) + ε tj+1

(4)

for assets j=1,…,J, periods t=1,…,T. That is, we allow {δ t } to vary period by period, while we
use a “three-factor” model and allow {β j } varying asset by asset. We normalize the data by
lagged prices since we believe that COV t ( m t +1 , x tj+1 / ptj−1 ) can be modeled by a simple factor
model with time-invariant coefficients more plausibly than COV t ( m t+1 , xtj+1 ) . The three FamaFrench factors are: 1) the overall stock market return, less the treasury-bill rate, 2) the
performance of small stocks relative to big stocks, and 3) the performance of “value” stocks
relative to “growth” stocks. Further details and the data set itself are available at French’s
website.1 For sensitivity analysis, we also examine two other covariance models: one with only
a single time varying factor, namely the overall market return; and the other without any timevarying factors at all (but, as always, with an asset-specific intercept).
Equation (4) can be estimated directly with non-linear least squares. The degree of nonlinearity is not particularly high; conditional on {δ t } the problem is linear in {β j } and vice

8

versa. We employ robust (heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent “Newey West”)
covariance estimators.
We use a moderately high frequency approach. In particular, we use two-month spans of
daily data. Using daily data allows us to estimate the coefficients of interest {δ t } without
assuming that firm-specific coefficients {β j } are constant for implausibly long periods of time.
Our empirical illustration examines the integration of American equity markets. Large
American stocks are traded on liquid markets, which we consider a priori to be integrated. We
begin by examining daily data over a quiet two-month period, April-May 1999 (about a year
before the end of the Clinton bull market).2 Two months gives us a span of over forty business
day observations; this does not appear to stretch our reliance on a factor model of asset
covariances excessively, while still allowing us to test financial market integration for an
interesting span of data. We see no reason why higher- and/or lower-frequency data cannot be
used.3
Our data set is drawn from the “US Pricing” database provided by Thomson Analytics.
We collected closing rates for the first (in terms of ticker symbol) one hundred firms from the
S&P 500 that did not go ex-dividend during the months in question. The absence of dividend
payments allows us to set xtj+1 = ptj+1 (and does not bias our results in any other obvious way).
We group our hundred firms into twenty portfolios of five firms each, arranged simply by
ticker symbol. We use portfolios rather than individual stocks for the standard reasons of the
Finance literature. In particular, as Cochrane (2001) points out, portfolios betas are measured
with less error than individual betas because of lower residual variance. They also vary less over
time (as size, leverage, and business risk change less for a portfolio of equities than any
individual component). Portfolio variances are lower than those of individual securities,

9

enabling more precise covariance relationships to be estimated. And of course portfolios are
what investors tend to use (especially those informed by Finance theory!).
Our first sample period consists of 41 days. Since we lose the first and last observations
because of lags ( ptj−1 ) and leads ( xtj+1 ) , we are left with a total of 780 observations in our panel
data set (20 portfolios x 39 days). Our data has been checked for transcription errors, both
visually and with random crosschecking.
There is no reason that one cannot use more data (longer spans at different frequencies,
for larger number of firms and/or portfolios grouped non-randomly). We choose this sample
(only two months of daily price data for one hundred firms grouped randomly into twenty
portfolios) deliberately to illustrate the power of our methodology and its undemanding data
requirements. However, we also check for sensitivity with respect to the sample below.

5: Results
We start by splitting our 20 portfolios into two sets of 10 portfolios each (simply by
ticker symbol) to estimate discount rates (i.e., estimates of δ t ≡ [1 / Et (mt +1 )] ). We provide timeseries plots of the estimated deltas from the first 10 portfolios along with a plus/minus two
standard error confidence interval in Figure 1. We also include the point estimates of delta from
the second 10 portfolios, estimated in precisely the same way but using data from the last set of
10 portfolios.
There are two striking features of the graph. First, the time-series variation in delta is
high, consistent with the spirit of Hansen and Jagannathan (1991). As shown in Table 1, the log
likelihood of our equation estimated on the first 10 S&P portfolios is 1160. In April-May 1999,
the US 3-month Treasury bill rate averaged 4.4%, a daily return of 1.00017 (with little time-

10

series variation). The log likelihood for the default equation estimated with 1.00017 substituted
in place of {δ t } is only 1059. Under the null hypothesis of deltas that are constant and equal to
the T-bill interest rate, 2*(1160-1059) is distributed as a chi-square with 39 degrees of freedom,
grossly inconsistent with the null at any reasonable confidence level. (When we use all 20
portfolios, the analogue is 2*(2309-2136), again grossly inconsistent with the null.) That is, the
hypothesis that the MRS is equal to the short t-bill rate is wildly inconsistent with the data. The
MRS seems much more volatile than short-term interest rates.
Second, the estimates of delta from the two different sets of portfolios are similar; the
deltas from the second set of portfolios almost always lie within the +/- 2 standard error
confidence interval of the first estimate of delta. That is, the two different sets of delta are
usually statistically indistinguishable on any given day, consistent with the null hypothesis of
integration within the S&P.
What about the two sets of delta examined jointly? The ocular evidence leads one to
believe that the two sets of deltas are broadly equal. The statistical analogue is contained in the
cells at the top left of Table 1. The log-likelihood of (4) estimated from the first set of 10
portfolios is 1160; that from the second set of 10 portfolios is 1166. When (4) is estimated from
all 20 portfolios simultaneously so that only a single set of {δ t } is extracted, the log-likelihood is
2309. Under the hypothesis of integration (i.e., the same {δ t } for both sets of assets) and
normally distributed errors, minus twice the difference in the log-likelihoods is distributed as a
chi-square with 39 degrees of freedom; a likelihood ratio (LR) test. The test statistic is 36,
consistent with the hypothesis of integration and normal residuals at the .61 confidence level.
It is well known that asset prices are not in fact normally distributed; Campbell, Lo, and
MacKinlay (1997). Rather, there is strong evidence of fat tails or leptokurtosis, and this certainly

11

characterizes our data.4 Accordingly, we use a bootstrap procedure to estimate the probability
values for our likelihood ratio tests.5 The bootstrapped p-value for the test of integration is even
more consistent with the null hypothesis of integration at the .90 level.
To check for sample sensitivity, we also consider five other sample periods: July-August
1999, October-November 1999, and the same three two-month samples for the bear market of
2002. Results from these other sample periods are also included in Table 1 and are also
consistent with the hypothesis of integration inside the S&P 500 at standard confidence levels.
What about the NASDAQ market for smaller stocks? We follow exactly the same
procedures, but using data drawn from the NASDAQ market. We group (again on the basis of
ticker symbol) data from 100 NASDAQ firms into 20 portfolios of 10 firms each, and test for
equality of deltas (between the two different sets of deltas, estimated from the two sets of ten
NASDAQ portfolios) using likelihood ratio tests with bootstrapped p-values. The results are
presented in Table 2, and are generally consistent with the null hypothesis of integration inside
the NASDAQ. However, one of our samples (April-May 2002) is inconsistent with integration
at the .03 confidence level (this is marked with an asterisk), while integration is overwhelmingly
rejected for Oct-Nov 1999 (two asterisks), shortly before the collapse of the NASDAQ. We
think of these as intuitive, reasonable results, possibly consistent with the existence of “irrational
exuberance” manifest in the NASDAQ just around the height of the internet bubble.
Still, the most interesting question to us is: Is the market for large (S&P 500) stocks
integrated with the NASDAQ? It is easy to ask the question by comparing {δ t } estimates when
(4) is estimated with: a) the twenty S&P portfolios; b) the twenty NASDAQ portfolios; and c) all
forty portfolios pooled together (which is most efficient if the two markets are integrated). Our
LR tests (with bootstrapped p-values) for this hypothesis are presented in Table 3 and are grossly

12

inconsistent with the null hypothesis of market integration. The LR test statistics are an order of
magnitude bigger than those of Tables 1 and 2. That is, while the S&P always seems integrated
and the NASDAQ is generally integrated, the S&P is never integrated with the NASDAQ. This
result is similar to that of Chen and Knez (1995).
Time-series plots of {δ t } estimated from all (twenty) S&P and NASDAQ portfolios are
provided in Figure 2 for all six sample periods, along with confidence intervals. Figure 3
provides scatterplots of S&P deltas against NASDAQ deltas. All these graphs indicate that there
is no single obvious characteristic difference between the S&P and NASDAQ deltas.

6: Sensitivity Analysis
Thus far we have relied on the Fama-French model of asset covariances. That is, the
covariance of each asset’s return with the MRS is characterized by four parameters: an intercept
( β 0j ) and factor loadings on the market return minus the T-bill rate ( β 1j ), the difference between
small and large stock returns ( β 2j ), and the difference between returns of stocks with high and
low book to market ratios ( β 3j ). Are our results sensitive to the number of factors used? It turns
out that the answer is negative.
In Table 4 we provide test statistics (and bootstrapped p-values) to examine tests of
integration within the S&P and NASDAQ and between the two markets, but using only the
return on the market instead of the three Fama-French factors (while retaining the portfolio
intercepts as well). The test statistics and conclusions are essentially unchanged.
Table 5 goes even further and drops the market factor from our covariance model,
leaving only portfolios-specific intercepts ( β 0j ) but no time-varying factors. Again, the results

13

are essentially unchanged. This robustness is encouraging since it demonstrates the insensitivity
of our methodology to reasonable perturbations in the exact factor model employed.

7: Summary and Conclusions
This paper developed a simple method to test for asset integration, and then applied it
within and between American equity markets. It relies on estimating and comparing the
expected risk-less returns implied by different sets of assets. Our technique has a number of
advantages over those in the literature and relies on just two relatively weak assumptions: 1)
rational expectations in financial markets; and 2) covariances between discount rates and returns
that can be modeled with a small number of factors for a short period of time.
We illustrated this technique with an application to stocks drawn from the S&P 500 and
the NASDAQ, and found that a) the time-series variation in the Marginal Rate of Substitution is
high; b) the S&P always seems to be integrated; c) the NASDAQ is usually (but not always)
integrated; and d) the S&P and NASDAQ do not seem close to being integrated. Our results
seem reasonably insensitive to the exact sample and conditioning model used.
If our finding of integration within but not across stock markets holds up to further
scrutiny, the interesting question is not whether financial markets with few apparent frictions are
poorly integrated but why? We leave that important question for future research.

We choose these months to avoid January (and its effect), February (a short month), and March (a quarter-ending
month), but test for sample sensitivity extensively below.
3
For instance, we could use data at five-minute intervals for a day, making our assumption of constant assetspecific effects even more plausible; but the question of whether financial markets are integrated over hours (not
weeks) is less interesting to us.
4
Jarque-Bera tests are inconsistent with the null hypothesis for {ε} at all reasonable confidence levels.
5
Our bootstrap procedure is as follows. We estimate the deltas from (say) all 20 portfolios under the null
hypothesis of integration. This gives us an estimate of {ε}. We then draw with randomly with replacement from
this vector to create an artificial vector of {ε} which we use to construct an artificial regressand variable {x}. Using
this artificial data we then generate a likelihood ratio test by estimating the model from the first set of 10 portfolios,
the second set of 10 portfolios, and the combined set of 20. We then repeat this procedure a large number of times
to generate a distribution for the LR test statistic.
