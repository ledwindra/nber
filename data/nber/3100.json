The MSG2 model is a dynamic general equilibrium model of the world economy which pays particular attention to the relation between stocks and flows and intertemporal constraints. The formation of expectations also plays an important role in the model. In the version presented here the world is divided into the U.S., Japan, Germany, the rest of the EMS, and the rest of the OECD, non-oil developing countries and OPEC.\n\n",
