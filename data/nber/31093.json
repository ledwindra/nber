    "abstract": "\n\nThis study explores the relationships between parental resource trajectories and child development, and their implications for intergenerational mobility. By modifying child skill formation technology to incorporate new skills emerging during adolescence, we analyze the importance of the timing of family resources on life outcomes, such as educational attainment and participation in crime. Parental financial resources partially offset deficiencies in nonpecuniary inputs to children\u2019s human capital, such as family stability. IGE estimates are less sensitive to parental and child reference ages but are strongly influenced by the choice of lifetime versus snapshot parental income measures.\n\n",
