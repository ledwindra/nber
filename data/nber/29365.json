    "abstract": "\n\nWhile major stock market indices are followed by large monetary investments, we document that membership decisions for S&P 500 have a nontrivial amount of discretion. We show that firms\u2019 purchases of S&P ratings appear to improve their chance of entering the index (but purchases of Moody\u2019s ratings do not). Furthermore, firms tend to purchase more S&P ratings when there are openings in the index membership. Such a pattern is also confirmed by an event study that explores a rule change on index membership in 2002. Finally, discretionary additions exhibit subsequent deterioration in financial performance relative to rules-based additions.\n\n",
