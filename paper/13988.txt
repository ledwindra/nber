Non-Economic Engagement and International Exchange: The Case of Environmental Treaties
Andrew K. Rose and Mark M. Spiegel
NBER Working Paper No. 13988
April 2008
JEL No. F10,F34
ABSTRACT
We examine the role of non-economic partnerships in promoting international economic exchange.
Since far-sighted countries are more willing to join costly international partnerships such as environmental
treaties, environmental engagement tends to encourage international lending. Countries with such
non-economic partnerships also find it easier to engage in economic exchanges since they face the
possibility that debt default might also spill over to hinder their non-economic relationships. We present
a theoretical model of these ideas, and then verify their empirical importance using a bilateral cross-section
of data on international cross-holdings of assets and environmental treaties. Our results support the
notion that international environmental cooperation facilitates economic exchange.

1. Introduction
Countries, like people, interact with each other on a number of different dimensions.
Some interactions are strictly economic; for instance, countries engage in international trade of
goods, services, capital, and labor. But many are not economic, at least not in any narrow sense.
For instance, the United States seeks to promote human rights and democracy, deter nuclear
proliferation, stop the spread of narcotics, and so forth. Accordingly America, like other
countries, participates in a number of international institutions to further its foreign policy
objectives; it has joined security alliances like NATO, and international organizations such as the
International Atomic Energy Agency. In this paper, we concentrate on the interesting and understudied case of international environmental arrangements (IEAs). We ask whether participation
in such non-economic partnerships tends to enhance international economic relations. The
answer, in both theory and practice, is positive.
Memberships in IEAs yield costs and benefits. A country can gain directly from such
interactions; its air might be cleaner, or there might be more fish in the sea. However, some
gains can be indirect. For instance, countries with long horizons and low discount rates might be
more willing both to protect the environment and to maintain a reputation as a good credit risk.
If they can signal their discount rate through IEA activity, participation in IEAs may indirectly
yield gains from improvements in credit terms. Alternatively, countries that are tightly tied into
a web of international relationships may find that withdrawing from one domain (such as
environmental cooperation), may adversely affect activities in an unrelated area (such as
finance). The fear of these spillovers may then encourage good behavior in the first area.
Our theoretical analysis begins with an extension of the “reputation spillover” concept
introduced by Cole and Kehoe (1997). In our model, countries – or rather, their policymakers –

1

differ in their attractiveness as borrowers. Formally, we model these differences as differing
discount rates among borrowing country governments, but one could envision alternative
differences, such as disparities across countries in the perceived cost of default on external debt
obligations. We concentrate on the example of discount rate differences in our theoretical model
for analytical tractability, but we do not intend to suggest that this is the only source of
heterogeneity in creditworthiness across countries.
With differing discount rates, more patient governments choose to join a greater number
of environmental treaties; this sends a credible signal concerning a country’s debt capacity.
Creditors respond by lending the country more capital. The predictions of this model are
multilateral, since membership in IEAs is easily-accessible common knowledge. A country that
joins more IEAs enhances its reputation with all nations.
This multilateral model is an intuitive start. Still, it misses the possibility that
membership in an IEA may confer special advantages to its members; if Argentina defaults on its
Brazilian debt, Brazil can retaliate by failing to support Argentine environmental initiatives. We
thus extend the model to accommodate bilateral spillovers. We allow a creditor to respond to
default by reducing the debtor’s gains from involvement in mutual IEAs. 1 This extended model
demonstrates that cross-country economic interaction can be a function of solo and/or joint
participation in environmental treaties. Succinctly: the more international environmental
commitments that countries make individually and in common, the easier is economic exchange
between the countries. 2
We then take these ideas to the data. Using a cross-sectional gravity model to control for
other phenomena, we find that participation in IEAs is indeed positively associated with the
international exchange of assets. This confirms the notion of positive spillovers between

2

environmental cooperation and economic exchange. Moreover, we find that multilateral IEA
participation is not a sufficient statistic to explain bilateral economic exchange; joint IEA
participation is also related to asset cross-holdings. We corroborate these findings using a panel
of data that includes bank loans and FDI. We use a number of instrumental variables to show
that our empirical results do not depend on the assumption that causality flows simply from
environmental engagement to economic exchange. Our empirics thus support our extended
model with both a reputation effect and some sort of bilateral punishment mechanism.
A brief survey of the literature section is provided in section 2, while our theoretical
framework is developed in the following section. The empirical work is presented in section 4.
The paper ends with a brief conclusion.

2. Literature Survey
The concept of reputation spillovers arose as a response to the Bulow and Rogoff (1989b)
challenge to the sovereign debt literature. In their seminal paper, Bulow and Rogoff cast doubt
on the possibility of sustainable sovereign lending based solely on the desire of borrowers to
maintain their reputations. They demonstrated that such relationships would not be sustainable,
because a borrower would eventually prefer to default on its debt and “self-finance” its
consumption-smoothing.
This challenge was addressed in a series of papers by Cole and Kehoe (1995, 1997,
1998). They show that the problem with reputation-based borrowing stems from the fact that a
borrower able to replicate interactions with other creditors receives only transient benefits from
such relationships. At some point, the benefits of maintaining a reputation fall sufficiently that
default and subsequent self-finance is the rational response. However, Cole and Kehoe (1995)

3

show that the desire to maintain other interactions with creditor nations may support debt,
provided that these other relationships are not transient but enduring. Cole and Kehoe (1998)
demonstrate that the desire to maintain reputations in enduring relationships can support a debt
relationship with transient benefits. Cole and Kehoe (1997) show that the desire to maintain an
enduring relationship can support a transient debt relationship in a simple trigger-strategy model,
where a creditor responds to default by breaking off debtor relationships with enduring benefits. 3
We borrow this modeling strategy below in our theoretical work.
Other signals of creditworthiness have also been examined in the literature. Milde and
Riley (1988) argue that borrowers can signal the quality of underlying investments through the
magnitude of borrowing. Alternatively, borrowers may resume payments subsequent to default,
either to affect bargaining negotiations (e.g. Gale and Hellwig, 1989) or to signal government
stability (e.g., Cole, Dow, and English, 1995). Similarly, creditworthy borrowers may signal
their types by pursuing fiscal contractions (e.g. Drudi and Prati, 2000), enduring costly
recessions prior to defaulting, as in Alfaro and Kanczuk (2005), or by accepting rescheduling
packages at tough terms as in Spiegel (2005).
On the other hand, default decisions can themselves be signals of other types of
information. Sandleris (2006) develops a model where government default decisions provide
information about economic fundamentals that affect private sector behavior. He shows that the
desire to signal to the domestic private sector that fundamentals are good can be sufficient to
generate lending in an environment without default penalties.
A different literature of relevance concerns the formation and characteristics of IEAs;
references here include Barrett (1994), Carraro and Siniscalco (1998), and Finus et al (2005).
Most of the literature is skeptical about the ability of voluntary self-enforcing IEAs to improve

4

on non-cooperative outcomes. The intuition is that the level of any attainable environmental
objective – say, abatement of a certain pollutant – is limited in a heterogeneous group by the
preferences of the nation least interested in the problem. While there has been some discussion
about encouraging greater participation in IEAs through cooperation in other dimensions such as
R&D activity (e.g., Carrero and Siniscalco, 1997), the literature is discouraged by the fact that
such agreements are not explicitly found in practice (Barrett, 2003).
Self-enforcing IEAs among proximate countries might be better able to achieve superior
outcomes if pollution spillovers are decreasing in distance [e.g. Davies and Naughton (2006)].
However, our analysis abstracts from geographic effects on the benefits of IEAs. 4

3. Economic Interaction and Participation in IEAs
Pure reputation model
We begin with a reputation-based model, where a government’s decision to engage in
IEAs enhances the ability of private entrepreneurs to acquire portfolio investment from abroad,
since it credibly signals a lower discount rate.
We model our analysis in terms of a representative host country. We assume that each
host country is endowed with x units of a perishable good in each period, t = 0,1,..., ∞ . There
are K foreign countries in the model. We assume that there are a large number of atomistic
foreign investors in a representative foreign country k that are willing to extend credit to the
host country firms, so long as the expected rate of return is greater than or equal to the risk free
rate. 5 For simplicity, all bonds are assumed to be one-period, and are in the form of portfolio
investments that are extended in period t − 1 and come due in period t . As borrowers in the host
country are limited to a credit ceiling that precludes default in equilibrium, competition among

5

investors from country k ensures that the nominal rate of return is equal to the risk free rate,
which we designate as r * .
Let ωtk represent the flow of capital from investors in country k to the host country in
period t. We assume that there are a large number of atomistic entrepreneurs in the host country
who are endowed with a technology that combines the foreign capital from country k to produce
aggregate output equal to y k (ωtk ) , where y ' > r * and y " ≤ 0 . For notational simplicity, we

drop the k superscripts and work in terms of a representative source country.
A national government maximizes its citizens’ discounted utility, subject to the
government’s discount rate, β . Utility satisfies
∞

U t = ∑ β i ct .

(1)

i =t

A continuum of categories of environmental issues J is distributed on the interval [0, J ]
with each category covered by an IEA with density f ( j ) , which we refer to interchangeably as
a “treaty.” A treaty requires participants to contribute a fixed amount of their consumption good
e in each period (including period 0) towards improving the environment. IEA j then yields a

benefit, v j , in each of the following periods t > 0 . We number the treaties such that v j ≥ v j +1 and
assume that v j is a continuous twice-differentiable function of j that satisfies v j ' < 0, v j " > 0 ,

and lim v j = 0 . We assume that a treaty is void when one of the signatories shirks, and that the
j →∞

shirker suffers a fixed penalty of φ each following period.
Private international investments are subject to sovereign risk. We assume that the
sovereign makes a repayment decision concerning whether or not to service the nation’s
outstanding private debt requirements and the private debtors in the borrowing nation comply

6

with the sovereign’s decision. Default is selective, in that the sovereign makes its default
decision on debt obligations to each nation separately. 6,7
The timing of the model is as follows. In period 0, the government receives its
endowment, and then chooses j * , the number of IEAs to join. It then chooses whether or not to
comply with the terms of these treaties and spends e if it complies. Next, investors in each
country k choose ωt , the aggregate amount of credit to extend to private borrowers in the host
country. Finally production occurs, followed by agents in the host country consuming the
unused portion of their endowment.
In subsequent periods, the government again decides whether to comply (or not) with the
treaty. In addition, it decides whether or not to announce a general default, and the foreign
investors choose the amount of new credit to extend to host country borrowers. Finally, agents
in the host country produce and consume, subject to any penalties for default or shirking on their
environmental commitments.
To insure sub-game perfection, we solve the model backwards, beginning in a
representative period t ≥ 1 . Initially, we treat default and IEA penalties as separate; below, we
also consider an extension which allows punishment through environmental treaties.
Consumption by country i in period t > 0 is equal to the country’s endowment, plus the
net gains from production (the value of output minus debt service) and environmental
improvement, minus any penalties incurred for debt default or shirking on IEA commitments: 8

where: ν j represents the net payoff from participation in treaty j (which equals ν j − e under
compliance, and −φ under non-compliance), and di t represents the individual firm’s debt service
payment, which equals ωt r * under debt service, and 0 under default. 9

Given debt service, the representative country continues to obtain funds from all k
countries in each period in the future. Discounted utility under compliance with both signed

We first examine the choice of how many IEAs to join. Under compliance, the host country
gives effort in every period (spends e), beginning with period 0, and receives v j in every period
beginning with period 1. Discounted utility in period 0 from joining and complying with debt

when (5) is satisfied. It follows that the debtor will choose ex post to comply with treaties that
are voluntarily signed.
We next turn to the default decision. The marginal decision is whether or not to default
on credit obligations to any single country k . In the event of such a default, we assume that it
loses access private capital flows from that country in the future. Discounted utility subsequent
to default on credit obligations to country k satisfies

By (3) and (8), the representative country will choose to default unless

(10)

since the denominator will be negative in the range where entrepreneurs in the host country are
credit constrained.
Equation (10) indicates that the credit ceiling will be a function of the creditor’s
perception of the discount rate of the host country government. That is, the number of IEAs in
which a country participates provides a signal of its discount rate and thus influences its credit
ceiling. Succinctly, the model implies that higher international environmental involvement is
associated with more international exchange of credit. 10

Addition of bilateral penalties
The prediction of the analysis above is multilateral; when Ruritania signs its IEAs, all its
potential sources of capital see this signal. We now add bilateral linkages across countries,
consistent with the framework of Cole and Kehoe (1997). We assume that if Ruritania defaults,
its creditors punish it in the environmental sphere. We then demonstrate that this possibility
increases economic integration over and above the level sustained through multilateral IEA
membership. In the next section, we take this prediction to the data to verify the empirical
importance of spillovers across different forms of interaction.
Formally, we specify the bilateral punishment to debt default as reducing the net gains in
each period from membership in IEAs in which both countries i and k are members by some
fraction γ , 0 < γ ≤ 1 , so that the gains from being in treaty j are equal to (1 − γ ) (ν j − e ) . 11 An

intermediate value of γ may reflect a loss in cooperation between the two nations, while γ = 1
would involve a “grim strategy,” where the creditor nation responds to a default by its debtor by
rescinding the treaty altogether. For simplicity, we assume that the value of γ is constant across
countries. 12
Define m as the highest-numbered treaty in which both countries participate. With the
addition of the bilateral treaty-based default penalty, the value of discounted utility under default
satisfies

Comparing (12) and (9), it can be seen that the capacity to levy bilateral environmental
treaty penalties under default eases the credit ceiling faced by country k . Moreover, the host
country government will again choose j * such that (7) is still binding. Substituting and totally
differentiating (13) with respect to ω and j * yields

ϕ j *γ ( v j * ) ( v j * − e ) f ( j *)

(13)

Comparing (13) to (10), it can be seen that if ϕ j * = 1, i.e., j* ≤ m , there is an additional
positive term corresponding to the bilateral treaty penalty. When j* ≤ m (that is, when adding
an additional treaty increases the number of joint host-creditor treaties), the addition of bilateral
penalties increases the sensitivity of the credit constraint to the number of treaties in which the
host country is a member.
Given j* > m , an increase in m represents an increase in the number of jointly held
treaties. Totally differentiating the credit constraint in (12) with respect to ω and m yields

(14)

when ϕm = 1, i.e. when j* > m ,which implies that the bilateral credit constraint is also
increasing in the number of treaties in which both the host country and the country of origin of
the creditors are members.
Our theory therefore yields two nested predictions. The pure reputation model implies
that the magnitude of flows from a source to the host country will be increasing in the total

11

number of environmental treaties in which that country is a member. The bilateral punishment

model also predicts that the magnitude of portfolio flows will be increasing in the number of
jointly held treaties. In the following section, we test these predictions empirically.

4. Empirics

We think of the model above as illustrative rather than one to be taken literally. We have
made a host of assumptions to keep the model stripped down to its bare essentials. For instance,
the model assumes: no production or uncertainty, much symmetry, limited interactions between
countries, and so forth. We think the analysis points to two key predictions. First, a country’s
non-economic commitments (which we model as the number of IEAs in which a country
participates) should have a positive effect on its ability to conduct international economic
exchange (which we model as international portfolio holdings). Second, bilateral non-economic
interactions may also matter; the level of multilateral IEA participation may not be a sufficient
statistic for the level of environmental engagement. The number of IEAs common to both
countries is also relevant to their bilateral economic interactions if there are “bilateral penalties.”
We now take these predictions to the data.

4A. Specification

Our pure reputation model predicts that the level of international asset cross-holdings
between two nations will be increasing in the number of IEAs in which each of them
participates, while the extended bilateral penalty model also predicts that the number of IEAs in
which they are joint members is relevant. Our goal in this section is to check these predictions.

12

Our empirical specification of international cross-holdings of assets is a generalization of
the standard bilateral “gravity” model. While gravity specifications have been primarily applied
to bilateral trade patterns, they have also been shown to explain bilateral financial flows
surprisingly well [e.g. Rose and Spiegel (2004, 2007) and Portes and Rey (2005)]. Since
transportation costs of moving assets are likely to be negligible, motivations for gravity
specifications of financial flows in the literature have concentrated on information asymmetries.
A theoretical justification for a gravity model for financial flows has been provided by Martin
and Rey (2000), who develop a model of trade between countries with endogenously supplied
assets that are imperfectly substitutable. International trade in these assets entails “iceberg”
transactions costs that are increasing in the distance between the country where the asset is
issued (which is also the location of the underlying real activity being financed) and the country
where the asset is purchased. Martin and Rey argue that these costs capture a number of costs
associated with international asset transactions, including banking commissions and fees,
transactions fees associated with currency exchange, exposure to currency risk, and information
costs.
Our specification satisfies:
ln ( Aij ) = β1 ln ( Dij ) + β 2 i ln (Yi ) + β 2 j ln (Y j ) + β 3i ln ( Popi ) + β 3 j ln ( Pop j )
+ β 4 RTAij + β 5CU ij + β 6 Langij + β 7 i ln ( Areai ) + β 7 j ln ( Area j ) + β 8Contij

•

Aij denotes asset cross-holdings held in host country i and sourced from j , measured in

(millions of US) dollars,

economic exchange of host country i's participation in international environmental treaties; γ2 is
the analogous effect of joint IEA participation by i and j.

4B. Data

14

Our regressand is asset cross-holdings. We use the Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey (CPIS) data set, available annually for 2001, 2002, and 2003 from the IMF. 13 This

records cross-holdings of asset stocks between up to 68 source and 221 host “countries”
measured in millions of US$. The countries in the data set are listed in appendix table A1. To
smooth the data out, we average our series across the years available, so that our data becomes a
single bilateral cross-section.
As control variables, we merge in data on population and real GDP data (in constant
dollars) taken from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. We exploit the CIA’s
World Factbook extensively for data on other regressors. 14 From it we find series on: latitude

and longitude, land area, landlocked and island status, physically contiguous neighbors,
language, colonizers, and dates of independence. We use these to create great-circle distance
and other controls. We obtain data from the World Trade Organization to create an indicator of
regional trade agreements, including some 178 regional trade agreements. Finally, we add the
Glick and Rose (2002) currency union dummy variable.
The coefficients of interest measure the effect of solo (multilateral) and joint (bilateral)
participation in environmental treaties. Our data set on environmental treaties is the
Environmental Treaties and Resource Indicators (ENTRI) data set produced by Columbia
University. 15 The ENTRI data set contains country-by-country indicators of participation in up
to 464 treaties. The treaties range from the “Act regarding Navigation and Economic Cooperation between the States of the Niger Basin” through the “Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties.” The data set includes the usual suspects, including, e.g.: CITES (the “Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora”); Biodiversity

15

(“Convention on Biological Diversity”); and the Kyoto Protocol (to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change).
ENTRI provides data for individual countries on: 1) which agreements the country has
signed (so that a country is a “signatory” to a treaty); 2) which agreements are in force (where
the country is a “party” to an agreement); as well as 3) agreements denounced (so that the
country is a “former party” to a treaty). There are only a small number of the latter; almost one
hundred countries have not denounced any agreements (the United States has denounced three
agreements; and the United Kingdom has denounced the largest number of treaties, ten).
For our multilateral regressor IEAi (as well as IEAj , which we use symmetrically as a
control), we simply sum up the number of agreements either signed or in force, and subtract from
this the number of denounced agreements. For our bilateral regressor ( IEAij ) we sum up the
number of agreements that are either signed or in force by both countries and subtract from this
the number of jointly denounced agreements. Simply adding up the number of international
environmental treaties is obviously a crude starting point, since treaties are not all of equal
importance. We consider a more careful weighting of participation in different treaties to be an
interesting topic for future work. 16
Descriptive statistics for the key variables are presented in Table A2. Table A3 contains
simple bivariate correlations between the key variables of interest. The regressors of interest are
all positively correlated with the regressands.

4C. Results

We begin by estimating our default equation with least squares, using standard errors that
are robust to heteroskedasticity. 17 Since our measure of a country’s international environmental

commitment is both measured with error and potentially simultaneously determined with asset
flows, we also take instrumental variable results seriously; more on this later.
Our benchmark OLS results are presented in Table 1. The first column presents a
specification in which only there are no environmental treaties entered at all. The next two
columns add: first, the number of treaties to which each of the host and source countries
separately belong (multilateral measures); and second, the number of environmental treaties to
which both countries belong (a bilateral measure). The most important column is that on the
right, which includes both the bilateral and multilateral measures of environmental treaties.
While the control variables are not of direct interest, it is reassuring to see that the default
gravity model seems to work well. Countries that are further apart have fewer asset crossholdings, while countries with greater economic mass (as measured by GDP) have more.
Holding GDP constant, countries with larger population (i.e., lower GDP per capita) exchange
fewer assets. A number of sensible features seem to raise cross-holdings, including a common
language, currency, land border, colonizer or regional trade agreement. Some of the purely
geographic features (the physical size of a country, whether it is landlocked, and whether it is an
island nation) also matter. The equation fits well, with an impressive R2 of .61 on a purely crosssectional basis.
Is there space for environmental commitment to matter above and beyond these factors?
Yes. Both the multilateral and bilateral number of environmental commitments have a positive
effect on asset cross-holdings. If one examines the column on the extreme right (which gives the
weakest results since it examines multilateral and bilateral effects simultaneously), for each
additional jointly signed environmental treaty, asset cross-holdings by .03%. This effect is small
but plausible, and statistically significant at any reasonable confidence level. If a pair of

17

countries were to move from the 25th percentile (with 7 jointly signed environmental treaties) to
the 75th percentile (with 54 joint treaties) holding other factors constant, asset cross-holdings
would be expected to rise by around 1.5%. Similarly, the effect of a host country’s
environmental commitment also has a small positive and statistically significant effect on asset
holdings; a one standard deviation increase in the number of environmental treaties signed raises
asset cross-holdings by around .65%.
We consider our OLS results to be basically supportive of the idea that non-economic
partnerships play a small but positive role in supporting economic exchanges such as
international cross-holdings of assets. Moreover, as we find that both multilateral and joint IEA
memberships are significantly positive, the results appear to support some level of bilateral
punishment as well.

Instrumental Variables

While we find our OLS results promising, we are reluctant to rely completely on them for
at least two reasons. First, there is potential cause for concern with simultaneity. Participation in
an environmental treaty requires a near-term sacrifice (for instance, the adherence costs
associated with pollution abatement) for a stream of future benefits (associated with a more
sustainable environment). Similarly, servicing international debt obligations also requires a
short-term sacrifice for a long-term benefit. Both phenomena therefore involve a tradeoff
between the benefits and costs of honoring long-run agreements; thus at some deep level, the two
phenomena share important features. 18 Measurement error is also a potentially serious issue,
since a simple summation of the number of active environmental treaties in which a country is
participating is a noisy indicator of its international environmental commitments. 19

18

As our default we use two instrumental variables for the number of environmental
agreements (we also experiment with other choices to check the robustness of our results). The
first is the country’s “polity” score, taken from the Polity IV data set. 20 This is a score that
measures the political nature of the country. It is available for 161 countries annually through
2003; the score for an individual country during a given year ranges from -10 (a high autocracy
such as Qatar or Saudi Arabia) through 10 (a high democracy such as Australia or Austria). We
think of this instrumental variable as desirable since more democratic political regimes are likely
to have longer time horizons.
Our second instrumental variable is more directly tied to environmental considerations.
We use the “Environmental Sustainability Index” (ESI), which was developed for the World
Economic Forum by the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and the Center for
International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University, and is available for up
to 145 countries for 2001 and 2002. 21
The ESI is described by its creators as “a measure of overall progress towards
environmental sustainability.” A high ESI rank indicates that a country has achieved a higher
level of environmental sustainability than most other countries; a low ESI rank signals that a
country is facing substantial problems in achieving environmental sustainability along multiple
dimensions. In 2001, the three countries with the highest and lowest ESI scores were Finland,
Norway and Canada, and Haiti, Saudi Arabia, and Burundi respectively.
The ESI was designed to permit systematic quantitative international comparisons of
environmental progress. It models environmental sustainability as a function of five phenomena:
a) the state of the environmental systems, such as air, soil, ecosystems and water; b) the stresses
on those systems, in the form of pollution and exploitation levels; c) the human vulnerability to

19

environmental change in the form of loss of food resources or exposure to environmental
diseases; d) the social and institutional capacity to cope with environmental challenges; and
finally e) the ability to respond to the demands of global stewardship by cooperating in
collective efforts to conserve international environmental resources such as the atmosphere.
Accordingly, the ESI was constructed by aggregating five “core components” which each
measure one of these phenomena; we also use the three most relevant of its components as
instrumental variables for sensitivity analysis. These measure: 1) environmental systems; 2)
environmental stress; and 3) human vulnerability to the environment. 22,23
We think of the ESI and its underlying components as providing measures of actual and
potential environmental damage. These are plausibly correlated with participation in
environmental treaties because countries with more pollution are plausibly more sensitive to
environmental costs and thus more likely to engage in IEAs; similarly, countries with greater
potential losses from environmental degradation. These environmental measures do not seem
closely related to a country’s willingness to services its international debt, especially if they are
caused by long-term geographic or historical features. However, we also examine alternative
instrumental variables below.
Our IV results are presented in Table 2, which is formatted similarly to Table 1.
Reassuringly, both coefficients of interest remain positive and statistically significant when
estimated with IV. Indeed, consistent with the notion of either attenuation and/or simultaneity
bias, the coefficients are even larger. The effect of joint environmental treaties has almost
doubled while the effect of a host country’s environmental treaties has more than quintupled! 24
We tend to act conservatively in our interpretation and thus try not to take these magnitudes too
literally, especially given that the precision of the estimates has deteriorated. 25 Still, it seems

20

reasonable to conclude that our positive OLS results do not stem simply from a flawed
estimation strategy.
We check the sensitivity of our results further in Table 3. We pursue three types of
robustness checks: 1) moving from time-averaged to annual data; 2) changing the instrumental
variables; and 3) taking into account regional effects.
We are comfortable with our strategy of averaging our three years of data into a single
cross-section. The span of the data is short so that the observations are highly dependent, and
some country-pairs are not available for every year. Still, panel estimation is technically
feasible. Accordingly, we estimated our equation by pooling our annual cross-sections,
including year effects. The OLS and IV results are tabulated in the first two rows of Table 3.
They indicate that our key finding of positive and significant effects of the number of both
multilateral and joint (bilateral) environmental treaties on asset cross-holdings is robust to using
pooled annual instead of a single cross-section of data.
The next rows experiment with the exact choice of instrumental variables. First, we
substitute the three most plausible components of the ESI (“environmental systems,”
“environmental stress,” and “human vulnerability”) for the portmanteau ESI measure itself. 26
Our two key coefficients of interest are still positive and significant when we follow this
estimation strategy. The same is true when we replace the Polity and ESI IVs with the number
of environmental treaties listed in the CIA’s World Factbook. Appendix C of the Factbook
tabulates 27 “Selected International Environmental Agreements”; we use the number of these as
an instrumental variable for the total (from over 450) number of agreements listed by ENTRI,
excluding only four that deal with the Antarctic. 27 Again, our two key coefficients of interest
remain positive and significant.

21

We have checked our results further by using a completely different set of instrumental
variables, derived from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) data set. In
place of polity and the ESI, we use as IVs values of: a) “Adjusted savings from CO2 damage,”
and b) “Adjusted savings from particulate emission damage.” These measure the effect on
national savings of environmental damage (both are measured as percentages of gross national
income). 28 Carbon dioxide damage is estimated to be $20 per ton of carbon (the unit damage in
1995 U.S. dollars) times the number of tons of carbon emitted; particulate emissions damage is
calculated as the willingness to pay to avoid mortality attributable to particulate emissions. We
choose these as measures of environmental damage that are available for a wide cross-section of
countries. Importantly, we used values of these variables that are averaged over annual
observations that are available between 1995 and 2000. Thus these instrumental variables
measure environmental damage for a country years before the period of interest to us, which
raises their plausibility as exogenous instrumental variables. Reassuringly, our coefficients
remain positive and significantly different from zero.
Finally, γ1 loses its statistical significance when we add three regional dummies (one for
observations where either country is African; another for observations where either country is
either Latin American or Caribbean; and a third where either country is Asian). On the other
hand, the key multilateral effect remains positive and significant when regional dummies are
included.
We conclude from all this that our finding of a positive and significant effect of IEA
engagement on international cross-holdings of assets, is not particularly sensitive to the exact
details of our econometric machinery. 29

22

4D. A Different Data Set

The CPIS data set used above corresponds to the international exchange of assets that we
model in our theoretical section. However, it is most appropriately used as a single crosssection. This precludes employing panel data techniques, which might provide a sharper
estimate of the effect of environmental engagement on economic exchange.
Accordingly, and for additional sensitivity analysis, we now examine a different data set,
drawn from the BIS. This data set has strengths; it is an annual panel that stretches back to 1983,
with over 40,000 observations that cover 25 source countries (or territories) and 205 host
countries. It has weaknesses; it covers only bilateral consolidated international banking claims,
and thus ignores many international assets exchanges. 30 We supplement the banking data (which
forms our regressand) with controls derived from the WDI (population and real GDP); ENTRI
provides us with data on environmental treaties.
Using the notation of equation (15), our default estimating equation for the BIS data is:

ln(Cijt) = β1ln(Y/Pop)it + β2ln(Y/Pop)jt + β3ln(Pop)it + β4ln(Pop)jt

(16)

+ γ1IEAijt + γ2IEAit + γ3IEAjt + {δt} + {φij} + εijt

where ln(Cijt) is the natural logarithm of consolidated international claims made by banks from
nationality i on country j during year t.
This is a relatively conventional gravity equation; a number of the more conventional
bilateral controls (such as distance or common language) are excluded since we include a
comprehensive set of both (dyadic) country-pair-specific fixed effects, {φij}, as well as a
comparable set of time-specific effects, {δt}. Thus, we present “within” estimates that rely only

23

on time-series variation in the effect of changes in treaty obligations on international banking
claims, holding constant country size, income, and all features common to time or country-pairs.
Default estimates of {γ} are presented in the top rows of Table 4. There are three rows:
the first only allows for joint effects of environmental engagement on economic exchange, the
second only allows the unilateral effects, while the last allows for both. In our cross-sectional
work of Tables 1-3, we found that both bilateral and unilateral effects seem to matter, and this
finding also characterizes the panel results of Table 4. Indeed, each of the effects is positive and
statistically significant at conventional significance levels; countries that participate in more
treaties either by themselves or with others also enjoy greater international banking activity. We
find the consistency of these panel results with the earlier cross-sectional CPIS results
encouraging.
Table 4 also has contains four types of sensitivity analysis. First, we use country-specific
random effects instead of fixed effects. As a second check, we replace the (dyadic) pair-specific
fixed effects in (16) with a comprehensive set of (unilateral) country-specific fixed effects. 31
Third, we estimate our equation with instrumental variables in place of OLS. 32 Fourth, in place
of using banking claims as our regressand, we merge in and substitute the stock of FDI stocks
using OECD data. 33 Most of these exercises show that our results are robust; in a few cases, the
results are not statistically distinguishable from zero. In no case do environmental treaties enter
with a significantly negative coefficient, either unilaterally or bilaterally. Overall, we find the
panel data results consistent with our cross-sectional analysis and at least moderately reassuring.

We conclude from all this that there indeed seems to be a link between environmental
engagement – as proxied through environmental treaty obligations – and international exchanges

24

of assets. Moreover, this link appears to reflect both overall and joint IEA participation,
suggesting that both the pure reputation and bilateral punishment channels for reputation
spillovers play a role in the determination of cross-holdings of assets.

5. Caveats, Summary and Conclusion

In this paper, we first developed a theoretical model that suggests that countries more
deeply enmeshed in international environmental arrangements should also find it easier to
engage in international economic exchange with the rest of the world. We then showed that two
countries with a joint interest in the environment should also find it easier to sustain large crossholdings of assets, since each can punish the other in one domain for transgressions in a different
domain. We then tested these ideas, using a recent cross-section of international asset holdings,
and environmental commitments. Our empirics verify the significance of both effects, especially
the first; multilateral environmental engagement facilitates international economic exchange. A
panel data set with bank loans and FDI provides further corroboration of our results, and our
results are insensitive to a number of features of our methodology, including the assumption that
IEA participation is either exogenous or correctly measured.
Is there a cost to “going it alone”? Is it costly for countries to ignore international
environmental agreements? Yes. Countries have varying degrees of foreign engagement. Some
are deeply enmeshed in defense alliances, environmental treaties, and international
organizations; others are not. Above and beyond the direct consequences of such entanglements,
we have found in this paper that countries with greater IEA participation also have higher trade
in assets. Thus membership in international institutions brings indirect benefits; not joining such
partnerships has costs. We chose to examine international environmental arrangements as one

25

example of non-economic interactions. However, there are a variety of other domains in which
countries interact; security arrangements and international organizations come to mind
immediately.
If our assertions are correct, they have consequences for policy. For example, the debate
on American participation in the Kyoto Protocol was framed in terms of the costs and benefits to
the United States of participation in that treaty. If participation in such organizations also
conveys indirect economic benefits, these externalities should not be ignored.
A number of questions remain: First, does bad behavior in the economic sphere (e.g.,
debt default) actually lead to retaliation outside the economic domain? For instance, do creditors
punish defaulters through environmental means? More directly, what are the costs of violating
IEAs? Do countries that violate international partnerships pay a cost, either indirect or direct?
We leave such fascinating questions for future research.

Conditions for separating equilibrium

We can rule out a pooling equilibrium if no individual country would choose to deviate
from its separating equilibrium solution to mimic a more patient government. We first examine
the case where there are no bilateral penalties. Suppose that the government chose a value of
j > j * in period 0. This would increase ω k and violate the credit condition (8), inducing the
host country to declare a multilateral default on all of its creditors. However, if j − j * is small,
(6) implies that the fixed penalty from treaty violation ensures compliance with all j treaties.
By (4) and (6)

By (9), the change in discounted utility of a small increase in j beyond j * then satisfies

The first term is positive, reflecting the increased output in the next period due to the
increase in credit constraint, while the second term is negative, reflecting the cost of entering into
undesirable treaties. For the entire term to be negative, the second term must be larger than the
first. This condition is more likely to be satisfied the less sensitive is the credit constraint to the
number of treaties joined and the steeper is the rate of decline in treaty payoffs with increases in
j
Note that this condition will be violated at the margin, as by (4) the second term goes to 0
as j → j * . This implies that to rule out any mimicking behavior it must be the case that treaties
are “lumpy,” in the sense that joining an additional treaty moves one a discrete distance away
from the margin. At the optimum, one would always choose to do some amount of mimicking as
the gains of doing so are first order, while the losses from mimicking are second order.
However, as treaties are discrete in practice, this does not pose a major concern.
The condition for a separating equilibrium in the presence of bilateral default penalties is
similar. As before, if the host country government joins j > j * treaties, its true credit constraint
would be violated and it will choose to default. The only distinction is that the gains from treaty
participation would also be reduced as a result of the bilateral default penalty.
As before, for small increases in j * the fixed penalty will induce the host country to
comply with all of its signed treaties. The gains from joining j > j * treaties with bilateral
punishment then satisfy

Comparing equations (A-2) and (A-3), it can be seen that the condition for ruling out the
pooling equilibrium is less restrictive due to the additional bilateral penalties that would be
levied on countries mimicking more patient governments. These are represented by the
additional bracketed term in (A-3).

A cautionary note: there is little evidence of punishment of any form for transgressions in international economic
exchange. However, as our model is deterministic, punishment is not observed along equilibrium paths.
2
In practice, evidence of punishment of any form for transgressions in international economic exchange is limited,
and the form of punishment posited in this paper is no exception. Still, there are a number of recent examples of
perceived linkages across different categories of commitments: In 2004, Argentine President Kirchner addressed a
Kyoto Protocol conference, saying it was “unacceptable” that third-world countries should be held to the terms of
their outstanding debts while first-world countries, such as the United States, had failed to fulfill their obligations to
stop global warming. The speech implied a link between political cooperation and international credit relationships.
In the case of trade relationships, we also see evidence of spillovers with non-economic partnerships. For example,
Russian President Putin openly tied Russian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol to European Union support for
Russian accession to the World Trade Organization.
3
There have been other approaches to the challenge raised by Bulow and Rogoff (1989b). Some have concentrated
on the ability of another creditor to step in and allow for self-finance subsequent to default. Eaton (1996) and
Kletzer and Wright (2000) examine the implications of limiting the commitment capabilities of creditors in
sovereign debt models to the level of their debtors. Wright (2002) concentrates on the possibility that the alternative
Swiss bankers may not be available for the pursuit of self-finance if creditors find it optimal to collude against a
borrower with a history of default. Krueger and Uhlig (2003) examine relationships where creditors have the ability
to commit to making contingent payments, but there is a positive cost of initiating a credit relationship that limits a
borrower’s ability to switch creditors subsequent to a default. All of these generalizations concerning alternative
financing opportunities defang the Bulow-Rogoff problem sufficiently to allow sovereign borrowing to reemerge.
4
We considered adding an interactive term to our empirical specification to allow the number of jointly-held treaties
between two countries to be of decreasing importance with the distance between those countries. However, this
specification encountered empirical challenges as this interactive term was highly correlated with the raw number of
jointly-held treaties, one of our variables of interest. As such, we left geographic considerations for future research.
5
In our data set, there are simultaneous bilateral portfolio investments in each direction. We make no attempt to
motivate these here, as for our purposes it is sufficient that foreign investors exist who are willing to make
investments as long as the expected rate of return meets or exceeds some minimal rate, which we set at the risk free
rate here (without loss of generality). However, one could motivate these cross-haulings of portfolio investments in
terms of diversification motives.
6
We allow for selective default to facilitate ease of comparison with the bilateral analysis that follows; allowing
only for multilateral default would produce the same result.
7
The relationship between government and private default decisions is typically associated with the so-called
“sovereign ceiling,” which limits a private borrower’s creditworthiness to less than or equal to the perceived
creditworthiness of the borrower’s government. This ceiling is motivated by episodes such as the 1982 Mexican
default, which applied to all public and private Mexican obligations. In practice, the relationship between sovereign
and private ratings is more complicated, as ratings on top private issues sometimes exceed the values assigned to
issues by their sovereign. Still, these public and private issues are highly correlated, suggesting the perception that
default risk on public and private obligations is linked.
8
The endowment implicitly includes a number of arguments that we take as exogenous to the government’s default
decision, including net proceeds from foreign investments.
9
Our specification implicitly sets a zero penalty on debt default for notational simplicity. However, we could easily
extend our analysis to include penalties for debt default as well. Under this alternative specification, countries could
sustain some level of positive borrowing without any IEA participation, but the amount of borrowing that could be
sustained would still be increasing in both unilateral and multilateral IEA participation.
10
This raises the possibility that a country might join more than its optimal number of IEAs in order to signal
(misleadingly) that it is more patient, and thus ease its credit ceiling. We derive the conditions necessary to rule out
this pooling equilibrium in an appendix.
11
The use of bilateral penalties ensures that our result that the host country would not choose to renege on
environmental treaties that it voluntarily joins is maintained. This might be changed if the penalties were levied on
the gross, rather than the net, benefits of the treaty, where the government would now choose to renege on some
marginal treaties, in particular on treaty j * .
12
The capacity to punish partners may differ across countries. For example, a large country may be able to
influence treaty policies more than a small one. However, as influence may differ in a number of unknown

38

dimensions, we do not attempt to introduce any explicit heterogeneity in punishment technology across countries,
although we do condition for other attribute differences, such as country size, in our empirical specification.
13
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/pi/cpis.htm. The CPIS data set has its foibles; for instance, a number of entries
are missing. Since a large number of asset cross-holdings are reported to be zero, we add .0001 to these
observations.
14
http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/
15
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/entri/
16
In the model above, our ability to monotonically order the IEAs in terms of desirability implied that if j*≥ji* an
increase in j* would have no impact on mi. In the data, however, countries are likely to have heterogeneous
preferences across treaties for a variety of reasons, allowing j* and mi to vary independently. We therefore treat
these variables as independent in our empirical analysis.
17
Clustering our standard errors by either host or source country makes little difference to their statistical
significance.
18
We thank a referee for making this point forcefully to us.
19
Measurement error likely exists in a number of dimensions: Other international organizations, such as the
European community, also contain environmental accords. Alternatively, the United States is not a member of the
Niger River Basin Accord primarily due to its location, and not due to the policy preferences of its government.

22
A country is environmentally sustainable in terms of its “environmental systems” component to the extent that its
vital environmental systems are maintained at healthy levels; relevant inputs include measures of air (SO2 and NO2)
and water (phosphorus) quality. A country is environmentally sustainable in terms of its “environmental stress”
component if the levels of anthropogenic stress are low enough to engender no demonstrable harm to its
environmental systems; relevant inputs include fertilizer pollution, pesticide use, coal usage, and vehicular reliance.
A country is environmentally sustainable in terms of its “human vulnerability” component to the extent that basic
needs of people and social systems are not vulnerable to environmental disturbances; relevant inputs include death
rates from respiratory and intestinal infectious disease. We note in passing that one of the (67) inputs into the
(“Global Stewardship” component of the) ESI is the number of international environmental organizations in which a
country participates. The main report of the ESI contains many more details of relevance;
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/es/esi/ESI_01_tot.pdf .
23
The core components can be further decomposed, since they in turn are based upon a set of 22 core “indicators”
each of which combines two to six “variables” for a total of 67 underlying variables.
24
The effect of a source country’s environmental commitment is now positive and significant; we have no
explanation for this result.
25
The relevant part of the first stage of our IV estimates is presented in Table A4 of the appendix. It shows that the
two instrumental variables (polity and ESI) are positively linked to the number of environmental treaties.
26
This allows us to eliminate the two other more potentially problematic ESI components (“Social and Institutional
Capacity” and “Global Stewardship”).

The data set and further information is available at http://www.bis.org/statistics/consstatsweb.htm#

In this case, we add controls for bilateral great-circle distance, #landlocked countries; #island nations, and
dummies for dependencies, and common land border/ language/colonizer, or colonial history. We use the GlickRose data set.
32
As instrumental variables, we use annual WDI measures of environmental degradation, including: CO2 emissions;
organic water pollution; and particle emissions.
33
Our OECD data is measured in millions of US$, and is taken from
http://fiordiliji.sourceoecd.org/vl=1792668/cl=33/nw=1/rpsv/~4145/v45n1/s1/p1. Foreign direct investment is
undertaken for many considerations that we do not consider and have not modeled here, including issues associated
with: the transfer of technology; managerial considerations; taxes and subsidies; factor proportions; trade policy;
product and labor market regulation; and corporate governance. Further, we make no attempt to differentiate
between horizontal and vertical FDI. Perhaps most importantly, differences in the environment and environmental

39

policy may well motivate FDI, since firms may well relocate production for environmental considerations.
Accordingly, we view our work as a simple robustness check; further work in this area is warranted.
