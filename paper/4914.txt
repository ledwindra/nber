ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND
ALCOHOL PROBLEMS

ABSTRACT
This study investigates the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and two

alcohol-related outcomes -- liquor consumption and highway vehicle fatalities. Fixed-effect
models are estimated for the 48 contiguous states over the 1975-1988 time period and within-

state variations are the focus of analysis.

Alcohol consumption and traffic deaths vary

procyclically, with a major portion of the effect of economic downturns attributed to reductions

in incomes. The intake of hard liquor is the most sensitive to the state of the macroeconomy.
There is no evidence, however, that fluctuations in economic conditions have a disproportionate
impact on the drunk-driving of young adults.

Economic Conditions and Alcohol Problems
Economic contractions are costly in many ways. Output declines and job losers must
frequently accept positions which are substantially inferior to those departed. For instance, five
years after permanent layoffs, displaced workers earn ten to thirteen percent less than if the
employment termination had been avoided (Ruhm, 1991) and unemployed individuals frequently

lose health insurance coverage (Horvath, 1987). Other, harder to quantify, costs may include
reduced opportunities for promotions, deteriorating working conditions, decreases in wealth, and
higher crime rates.

Local and national downturns may also adversely affect health. Seminal, but widely
disputed, analysis by Harvey Brenner (1975a, 1975b, 1979) suggests that recessions are
associated with higher admissions to mental hospitals and increased mortality due to

cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, suicide, and homicide. Primary focus in this and related
research is placed on psychological determinants, particularly increases in stress and risk-taking.

The lack of attention to economic factors is surprising given the substantial investigation of
medical care, lifestyle choices, and health outcomes in the context of human capital investments
(e.g. Grossman, 1972) and, more recently, of the economic determinants of addictive behaviors
(e.g. Becker & Murphy, 1988; Akerlof, 1991; Chaloupka, 1991).

Economic models treat health as one argument in the utility function. Health status is
determined by stochastic shocks but also by economic factors such as changes in incomes and
the relative price of medical care, Thus, health could deteriorate during economic slumps as
earnings decrease and medical insurance is lost. However, since the utility function contains
many other inputs, some of which indirectly affect health, it is possible that at least some aspects

of health will improve. For example, ceeris paribas, falling incomes lower the consumption of
Page

normal goods such as drinking and driving, with the result that alcohol-involved traffic crashes
may decline.' By contrast, research focusing on psychological responses to local or national
recessions suggests that drinking will increase, as self-medication for stress, and that there may

be higher levels of risky behaviors such as drunk-driving.2
This study investigates the relationship between economic conditions and two

alcohol-related health outcomes -- liquor consumption and highway traffic deaths — which
provide information on different dimensions of the relationship between drinking and health.

Increased alcohol consumption need not adversely affect health, if concentrated among light

drinkers. Most available evidence (e.g. Coate & Grossman, 1988), however, indicates that the
demand of heavy drinkers is at least as responsive as that of recreational users to changes in
prices and incomes.3 This suggests that drinking problems are likely to be closely related to

average consumption levels. Motor vehicle fatalities are employed as an indicator of

alcohol-involved driving. Traffic crashes are the leading cause of injury deaths in the United
States. Approximately one-half ofthese fatalities are alcohol-related (Zobeck, et. aL, 1991), as
are

two-thirds of those occurring at night (Heeren et. al. 1985).

Skog (1986) or Wagenaar & Streff (1989) provide evidence that liquor consumption is
positively corelated with incomes.
2 For example, Brenner &
Mooney (1983, p. 1128)write: "recession increases the probability of
a variety of losses and social changes that potentially threaten health. Attempts to alleviate
psychological distress by medication with alcohol or legal and illegal drugs ... will tend to
exacerbate existing morbidity and produce additional health problems." The psychological
literature also allows for more complex labor market effects. For Stance, some theories
emphasize the stressful nature of employment, suggesting that increased job-holding might raise
liquor consumption (e.g. Wilsnack & Wilsnack, 1992 provide a summary of recent research
examining the influence ofemployment on the drinking behavior of women).
Leung & Phelps (1993) review recent research on the demand elasticity of alcohol

consumption.

Previous examinations of the relationship between health and the macroeconomy contain

potentially serious methodological problems. In time series analyses, trends in economic
conditions are likely to be spuriously correlated with noncontrolled for factors which influence

health. Cross-sectional estimates also suffer from confounding, if unobservables affecting health
are correlated with macroeconomic variables. As an alternative, this paper estimates fixed-effect
(FE) models, using pooled time-series/cross-sectional data. Fixed-effect estimates reduce or
eliminate the problem of confounding by exploiting within-state fluctuations in economic
conditions which are independent of both national trends and cross-state differences in
time-invariant unobservables affecting health.

1. Methodological Issues

Analyses using aggregate time-series data typically estimate some variant of the modeL

(I)

Y1=a+Xj1+Zy+;,

where Y measures health, Z is the indicator of economic conditions, X a vector of covariates,
and c is an error tenn. For instance, in Brenner (1975a), health outcomes are proxied by
mortality rates, X includes controls for incomes and government spending, and Z is a vector of
current and lagged unemployment rates. Brenner uncovers a strong positive correlation between
unemployment and mortality, leading him to conclude that health varies procyclically.

A number of researchers (Gravelle, et. al., 1981; Stern, 1983; Wagstaff, 1985) have
pointed out serious technical flaws in Brenner's analysis and later studies which correct for these
problems (Forbes & McGregor, 1984; McAvinchey, 1988; Joyce & Mocan, 1993) fail to
replicate his findings.4 Instead, the results are sensitive to the choice of countries, the proxies

Criticisms include Bretmefs method of choosing lag lengths, the hypothesized pattern of lag

used for health, and the time period analyzed. Significantly, elevated unemployment is

frequently correlated with improvements rather than deteriorations in health. This fragility of
results should not be surprising since research using time-series data contains a fimdamental

shortcoming which severely limits its usefulness. Any lengthy time-series is likely to contain
omitted variables which are spuriously correlated with the regressors and outcome variables.5
To show this concretely, assume that the "true" model is:

(2)
where Q is unobserved and $ is white noise. If Z and Q are related according to Q, = Zd + m,,

where m is uncorrelated with Z, then the error term in (1) is; = Z,6 + Pt + 4 and the probability

limit of (the estimated unemployment coefficient) is y + 8, which is upwards (downwards)
biased if the unobserved factor is positively (negatively) correlated with Z.

Cross-sectional data suffer from a similar problem. For instance, Junankar (1991)
estimates:
(3)

where mortality rates are again the dependent variable and i indicates a specific

regionloccupation population subgroup in Britain. f is biased if demographic group
unemployment rates are correlated with unobservables which influence mortality. In this
example, unskilled blue collar workers are likely to experience the most joblessness but also to
coefficients, choice of covariates, and the plausibility of his results. For instance, the strongest
effects on mortality are observed for infants and the elderly, groups for whom employment status
should
be a relatively less important determinant of health.
$
For example, much of the variation in unemployment during the four decades covered by
Brenner's research is accounted for by dramatic reductions in joblessness following the end of the
great depression. During this same period, mortality declined due to improvements in nutrition
and increased availability of antibiotics. Failure to control for these factors leads Brenner to
overstate the detrimental health impact of unemployment.
Page 4

have relatively high mortality rates due to factors such as lack of education or unhealthy
lifestyles.
Some (but not all) important covariates can be controlled for if microdata is used,

however, doing so introduces other problems. In particular, unemployment can no longer be

considered exogenous, since poor health may cause rather than result from joblessness.' Also,
research which contrasts the health status of employed and nonemployed workers (e.g. Bjorkland
1985; Hammarstram, et. al. 1988; Moser, et. al. 1984) will capture only a portion of the total
impact of changes in economic conditions, since recessions affect a broad cross-section of the
working and nonworking population, not just those individuals experiencing unemployment.7

As an alternative, this paper estimates fixed-effect models using pooled data for the 48

contiguous states. The "true" model is assumed to be:

YLa,+Xj3+ZI,y+SI+XlL,

(4)

where Y is the value of the dependent variable for state i at time t, Z the measure of economic

conditions, X a vector of other covariates, and X is a "white noise" error term. The time-specific
intercept, a, accounts for time-varying characteristics which influence health and have changed
in a uniform manner across the nation (e.g. changes in the maximum interstate highway speed
limit). The state fixed-effect, S, controls for factors which vary across states but remain fixed

Janlert, et. al. (1991) for evidence.
One advantage of microdata is that it will sometimes provide better (or at least different)
information on the outcomes of interest. For instance, Kenkel (1993) and Mullahy & Sindelar
(1994) have used answers to questions in the 1985 and 1988 National Health Interview Surveys
asking "how many times during the past year did you drive when you had perhaps too much to
drink' to construct measures of drunk-driving. Since most instances of drunk-driving do not
result in accidents, this variable is likely to pick up manycases of alcohol-involved driving not
captured by vehicle fatality rates used in this paper. On the other hand, the self-reported measure
is more likely to suffer from serious response biases. Consistent with the results reported below,
both Kenkel and Mullahy & Sindelar uncover a positive correlation between employment and
drunk-driving.

therefore measures the impact of intra-state deviations in economic

conditions. Since the relative performance of state economies varies over time, the FE estimates
largely avoid the aforementioned problems of confounding.S

2. Data
The analysis below uses data for the 48 contiguous states over the 1975 through 1988
tithe period.9 Two main outcomes are considered -- alcohol consumption and highway fatalities.
Enfonnation on the per capita consumption of beer, wine, and distilled spirits are from the

Brewer's Almanac, which is published annually by the U.S. Brewers' Association.'° These data
are used to calculate the total consumption of alcohol, in gallons of ethanol, using conversion
factors provided by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's Alcohol
Epidemiologic Data System.
Since relatively few states test all drivers involved in accidents for alcohol impairment,

proxy measures for drunk driving are required. This analysis considers both the total fatality rate
(TFR) and the night-time fatality rate (NFR), where the latter is defined to include deaths
resulting from accidents occurring between midnight and 3:59 A.M. Although a larger
percentage of night-time deaths involve alcohol, the number of such accidents is considerably
smaller, reducing the reliability of the estimates. Thus, it is unclear which of the two measures is
preferred. Traffic fatalities are also separately broken out for youths (15-20 and 21-24 year aIds),
Fixed effect techniques were first used in alcohol research by Cook & Tauchen (1982, 1984)
to indicate the impact of liquor taxes on heavy drinking and pjjniru drinking ages on vehicle
mortality. More recently, DuMouchel et. al. (1987) have employed FE models to evaluate the
relationship between drinking ages and fatal crashes and Saffer & Chaloupka (1989) tostudy the
impact of preliminaty breath test laws. Evans & Graham (1988) providea rare example of
research using FE estimates to investigate the relationship between macroeconomic conditions
and a health outcome (vehicle fatalities).

fatalities, minimum legal drinking ages, and beer taxes which are used in this analysis.

in order to consider age-variations in the impact of economic conditions. Data on traffic
fatalities are from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's FatalAccident

Reporting System.
Unemployment rates and the percentage of the population employed (hereafter referred to

as the employment-to-population or EP ratio) are used as proxies for macroeconomic conditions.
Unemployment rates furnish direct information on the ability of labor market participants to find

jobs and have been widely utilized in previous research. EP ratios are used because some
economists (e.g. Clark & Summers, 1982) believe that they provide a more accurate measure of
labor market conditions, particularly for groups such as young workers who frequently enter and

exit the labor force. Unpublished data on unemployment rates and EP ratios were provided by
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and refer to the noninstitutionalized civilian population aged

16 and over. Per capita incomes are sometimes controlled for, using U.S. Department of
Commerce (1989, 1990) data. Some specifications are also estimated with the growth rate of
Gross State Products (GSP) as the macroeconomic measure (with data obtained from the U.S.
Department of Commerce 1988, 1991).

The tax rate on 24-12 ounce containers of beer is the proxy for alcohol prices. Data on
beer taxes are from the Brewer's Almanac. Information on taxes, rather than prices, is used
because the former are determined independently of liquor demand, whereas an outward shift in
the demand curve will increase both the price of alcohol and the quantity consumed.'1 Numerous
researchers have shown that higher alcohol taxes reduce drinking and related problems.'2

Saffer & Grossman (1987) discuss this issue in greater detail.
Cook & Moore (1993) provide a detailed discourse on alcohol taxation.

The minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) is controlled for since it is negatively

correlated with tiquor consumption and drunk-driving (Coate & Grossman, 1988; O'Malley &
Wagenaar, 1991) and exhibits considerable within-state variation during the sample period)3

The MLDA refers to purchases of beer with an alcohol content greater than 3.2%. Data on
drinking ages are obtained from Wagenaar (1981/2) and various issues of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration's A Digest of State Alcohol-Highway Safety Laws.'4

Table 1 presents sample means and standard deviations for important outcome and
explanatory variables, weighted by the population of adults (aged 16 and over) in each state.
Gross state products, per capita incomes, and beer taxes are in 1987 dollars. with the implicit

price deflator used to adjust for price changes. Consumption of beer, distilled spirits, and wine
are in actual gallons, while total alcohol consumption is measured in gallons of pure ethanol.

National trends in key variables are displayed in figure 1. Vehicle fatalities and alcohol
consumption peak part way into the sample period (1979 and 1981 respectively), legal drinking
ages increase monotonically over time, and unemployment rates are unusually high during the

recessions of the middle 1970s and early 1980s. The figure does not reveal any obvious
relationship between national unemployment rates and alcohol outcomes. However, the impact
of macroeconomic factors could be masked by strong time trends in drinith g or drunk-driving,
which mask the impact of fluctuations in the (national) macroeconomy.
FE models rely on within-state variations in economic conditions and have the potential
for improving on (aggregate) time-series analyses if there are substantial economic fluctuations

Twenty-eight states raised the legal drinking age between 1976 and 1988, a dramatic reversal
of the downward trend observed during the early l970s.
Weighted averages are used to reflect changes in state beer taxes or MLDAs occurring during

across states. To show that this condition is met, table 2 presents the squared correlation
coefficient (R2) between individual states and the entire nation for unemployment rates, ER

ratios, and changes in Gross Domestic Products. in the case of unemployment, the R2 is below
0.5 (0.75) for 21(33) of the 48 states. Similarly, the R1 is lower than 0.5 (0.75) for 9(25) states
for ER ratios and for 20 (32) states when considering gross domestic products.

Further evidence of the aspersion in economic performance is provided in figures 2
through 4, which display unemployment rates, ER ratios, and changes in Gross Domestic
Products for the US and for four large states — California, Illinois, New York, and Texas. The

figures show relative deterioration, over the sample period, in the economies of illinois and

Texas and contrasting improvement in California and New York. This reflects the healthy
economic growth on the two coasts and stagnation in the middle of the country occurring during
this time period.

3. Econometric Analysis
This section presents econometric estimates of the relationship between macroeconomic

conditions and alcohol-related outcomes. Most of the results are for fixed-effect models.
Equations which exclude state and time dummy variables and those using national data are also

included for comparison purposes. When considering drinking, the dependent variable is the
natural log of gallons consumed. Since vehicle mortality is a rate, restricted to the range zero
through one, logit models are estimated for this outcome. The dependent variable in the logit

model is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio. For instance, if Y is the traffic fatality rate, the

regressand is y1 ln[Ya(1-YJ']. The error term is heteroscedastic, with variance [Y4(1-Y13nJ',

for; the population of state i at time t. Efficiency is therefore maximized by using weighted
least squares, with cell weights [Y1(l-Y1Jnj"2.
3.1 Unemployment Rates and Alcohol Outcomes
Alternative specifications of a basic equation comparing unemployment rates (UN) and

alcohol outcomes (Y) are shown on table 3. The first column presents results of the model:

(5)
estimated using time-series data for the entire United States, with I a quadratic time trend. This

corresponds to the methodology of previous research using aggregated data. As discussed, is
likely to be biased due to spurious correlation between unobservable characteristics and

unemployment rates. The second column displays estimates of:
(6)

Y4=cz+UN11y+T5+c11,

which uses pooled state-level data. Equation (6) is roughly analogous to prior studies employing
cross-sectional information. Column c) is the same as b), except that the time trend is replaced
with a set of year dummy variables, thus holding constant time-varying national factors which

influence alcohol outcomes)5 The last two columns present results for fixed effect models,
which include a vector of state dummy variables. They differ in that column e) controls for the
beer tax rate and MLDA, whereas column d) does not.

The unemployment coefficients are sensitive to the specification chosen. FE estimates
indicate that increases in a state's unemployment rate are correlated with lower alcohol

consumption and fewer vehicle fatalities (see columns d and c)." Substantially different results
For instance, changes in U.S. economic conditions or in the national sentiment towards drunk
driving are controlled for.

unemployment rates are uncorrelated with alcohol consumption (column a), whereas the negative

association is overstated when focusing upon differences between states (columns b and c). As
mentioned above, the former occurs because the strong concave trend in liquor consumption

dominates any national business cycle effect. The latter is observed because liquor intake is
persistently high (but presumably for reasons unrelated to economic conditions) in states with
relatively elevated unemployment rates. These findings highlight the importance of using data
containing multiple observations for each time period and controlling for unobserved fixed
effects.

As other researchers have found, beer taxes and MLDAs are inversely related to liquor

consumption and vehicle fatality rates (see column e). Comparison of colunuis d) and e) shows,
however, that the addition of these two key alcohol policies has virtually no impact on the

estimated unemployment coefficients. This suggests that FE estimates of macroeconomic effects
are robust to the choice of supplemental covariates.

3.2 Fixed-Effect Estimates
The econometric estimates in the remainder of the paper are variants of the FE model:

(7)
Y represents the dependent variable for state i at time t, Z includes contemporaneous and
sometimes lagged values of state economic conditions, a is a time-specific intercept (a vector of
time dummy variables), S a time-invariant state effect (a vector of state dummy variables), X are

the other covariates, and X is the error term. Included in X are beer taxes, the MLDA, and, in
some specifications, per capita personal incomes.
significant effect of changes in joblessness.
Page 11

Adding personal incomes to the set of explanatory variables will shift ttowards zero if
economic contractions partially affect alcohol outcomes by reducing earnings. The income

coefficient is likely to understate the role of economic factors, however, because it does not
account for changes in relative prices (e.g. the increased cost of medical care if employer-based

health insurance is curtailed) or in the income distribution. Therefore, the unemployment
coefficient continues to reflect both psychological influences and economic factors other than

average incomes.
Table 4 presents FE estimates with the unemployment rate used as the proxy for
economic conditions and alternative lag specifications allowed for. There is little evidence that
the inclusion of lagged regressors substantially improves the predictive power of the models.
Previous unemployment is unrelated to alcohol consumption. For vehicle fatalities, the first and
second lags have offsetting effects, with the result that the parameter on the current
unemployment rate with lags excluded (column a) is virtually identical to the sum of the

coefficients on UN'2 through UN,, when all three are controlled for (column c). The remainder
of the analysis therefore focuses on contemporaneous effects.

Alcohol consumption and vehicle deaths are procyclical. The estimates in column a)
indicate that raising the unemployment rate from its mean value to one standard deviation above
it (an increase of 2.12 percentage points) lowers predicted drinking by 1.3% and decreases traffic
deaths by almost 7%h7 The importance of economic determinants is highlighted by noting that

the unemployment coefficients ae reduced by more than one-third for traffic fatalities and over
two-thirds for liquor consumption when per capita incomes are controlled for (see column d).

Evaluating the other regressors at their sample means, the expected vehicle fatality rate
declines from 2.03 to 1.89 per 10,000persons.
Page 12

Furthermore, earnings are strongly positively correlated with both outcomes. For example, a one
standard deviation increase in the state unemployment rate lowers predicted drinking by just

0.4% in column d) versus 1.3% in column a). Ceteris pan bus, a $1000 reduction in personal
incomes decreases expected liquor consumption by 1.5%.
The finding that drinking and traffic fatalities are positively related to economic

conditions is robust to changes in the method of measuring the latter. For instance, substantially
analogous results are obtained when the employment-to-population ratio, rather than the

unemployment rate, is controlled for. As shown in table 5, rising EP ratios are associated with
increased consumption of alcohol and higher vehicle fatality rates (e.g. a one point rise in the
percentage of the population employed elevates predicted liquor consumption by .8%, versus the

.6% increase expected if the unemployment rate falls by one percentage point). Much of the
business cycle effect is again the result of income changes and the latter are positively correlated

with both outcomes. Thus, the unemployment coefficient is cut approximately in half when
personal incomes are controlled for and a $1000 increase in incomes is expected to raise alcohol
consumption by 1.2%. Similar results were obtained for a series of equations (not displayed)
with changes in Gross State Products as the macroeconomic variable-- the growth rate of GSP
is positivety related to both alcohol consumption and traffic deaths.

33 Alcohol Consumption
The effects of the economic conditions on drinking vary markedly with the type of
alcoholic beverage considered. This is shown in table 6, which displays separate fixed-effect
estimates for the consumption of beer, distilled spirits, and wine. The intake of hard liquor is by
far the most sensitive to the state of the economy. A one percentage point increase in the state
unemployment rate towers the predicted consumption of spirits by over 1.1%, compared to just
Page

13

0.4% for beer or wine (column a). A corresponding one percentage point reduction in the EP
ratio decreases the expected intake of spirits, beer, and wine by 1.3%, 0.5%, and 0.9%

respectively (column c).
The strong response of spirits consumption to macroeconomic conditions largely results

from its relatively high income elasticity. A $1000 decrease in personal incomes lowers the
drinking of distilled liquor by between 2.2% and 2.3%, depending on whether the unemployment
rate (column b) or EP ratio (column d) is controlled for, whereas the decline isjust 0.9% to 1.3%
for beer and -0.5% to 0.5% for wine.'8 One possibility is that reduced incomes decrease the
relative demand for spirits because individuals shift drinking away from bars and restaurants,
where liquor is relatively expensive and spirits are disproportionately imbibed, and towards

consumption in the home, where beer is the drink of choice.'9 To the extent that off-premise
drinking is no longer followed by driving, this may help to explain the fall in alcohol-involved
vehicle fatalities observed during downturns.

3.4 Motor Vehicle Fatalities
Further detail on traffic deaths is obtained by providing results for night-time, as well as

total, fatalities and separate estimates for youths aged 15-20 and 21-24. Although teenagers and
young adults are more than twice as likely as older persons to die in traffic accidents and are
involved in fatal night-time crashes three times as often (see table 1), there has been no previous
analysis of whether the sensitivity of drunk-driving to economic conditions varies with age.

'

Chaloupka & Saffer (1990) present evidence that price elasticities are higher for distilled

spirits than for wine or beer, further indicating the relative sensitivity of spirits consumption to
economic factors.
Average prices (per ounce of ethanol) of spirits are over twice as high as for wine and more
than 70% above those of beer; alcohol is more than three times as costly on-premise as
off-premise, with the greatest differential observed for spirits (Treno, et. al., 1993). Thus, when
Incomes fall, substitution is likely to occur away from spirits and towards off-premise use.
Page 14

Results of the vehicle fatality equations are summarized in table 7, with unemployment rates are

controlled for. Similar findings were obtained when EP ratios were used to proxy the
macroeconomy.2° Bracketed entries show estimated elasticities of traffic deaths to changes in the

unemployment rate, calculated as = (1 — pkj,

for (Jj the logit coefficient on the jffi regressor

and .5, and P the sample means of the JIb explanatory variable and motor vehicle death rate
respectively.
Although both types of traffic mortality decline as the macroeconomy worsens, the

reduction in night-time deaths is only about half as large as for total fatalities. Thus, a one
standard deviation inciease in the unemployment rate is associated with a 7% lower TFR (from

23.0 to 18.9 per lOO,000persons) but with just a 3% reduction in the NFR (from 4.16 to 4.04
deaths per 100,000). Much of this difference is likely to reflect cyclical changes in driving
patterns, whereby commuting to work and daytime pleasure driving are disproportionately
reduced during economic contractions. Even when measured by the NFR, however, there is a
small but statistically significant reduction in drunk-driving when the economy deteriorates.
The patterns for 21-24 year olds are similar to those for the whole population, with

modest evidence of greater cyclicality of night-time fatalities. The elasticity of the NFR to the

unemployment rate is .098 for the Ml sample, compared to .117 for those aged 21-24. By
contrast, total and night-time traffic fatalities of 15-20 year olds are less sensitive to changes in

the macroeconomy than those of all adults or of 21-24 year olds. For example, the
unemployment elasticity of the TFR is .23 for both the Ml population and those aged 21 to 24,
versus .15 for 15-20 year olds (column a).

20

The main difference is even stronger evidence of procyclical changes in night-time fatalities
for the all individuals and for 21 to 24 year olds.
Page 15

Disparate income effects account for at least some of the difference across age groups.
Night-time vehicle deaths rise with incomes for 21-24 year olds and for the entire population but
fall for those aged I 520.21 Holding incomes constant, the NFR of 15-20 year olds is actually the

most responsive to changes in unemployment rates -- elasticities are .111 and .084, respectively,

for 15-20 and 21-24 year olds, and .068 for all adults (column d). As discussed above, the
consumption of spirits is particularly sensitive to the state of the economy. Since hard liquor is
disproportionately consumed on-premise and by mature adults, a decrease in incomes may
therefore cause a relatively large reduction in drinking in commercial establishments and in the

subsequent alcohol-involved driving of older persons. By contrast, youths primarily purchase
beer for off-premise use and its consumption is relatively insensitive to macroeconomic
conditions.22

4. ConclusIon
This study investigates the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and two
alcohol-related health outcomes — liquor consumption and highway vehicle fatalities.

Fixed-effect models are estimated for 48 contiguous states over the 1975-1988 period. The
analysis focuses upon within-state differences in economic conditions and most specifications
include controls for individual year effects, beer taxes, and the minimum legal drinking age. Per
21

These results must be interpreted cautiously, since the null hypothesis of no income effect
can not be rejected at the .05 level for any of the three groups.
For instance, in data from the Alcohol Supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview
Survey (provided to me Gerald Williams of the Alcohol Epidemiologic Data System), 77% of
18-20 year old male drinkers report a preference for beer and only 10% for spirits. For 35-54
year old men the corresponding figures are 52% and 28%, respectively, and for men over the age
of 75, 30% and 48%. Women are less likely to prefer beer at all ages but the same pattern of
relative preferences is observed.

capita personal incomes are sometimes held constant, to provide a crude indication of the portion

of the total business cycle effect accounted for by changes in earnings.

Fixed-effect specifications avoid many of the spurious correlation problems present in
aggregate time-series or cross-sectional data. Comparison of results obtained for the three types

of estimates shows that these biases are empirically important. For instance, the response of
alcohol consumption to changes in unemployment rates is understated when using national

time-series data. This occurs because liquor intake exhibits a strong concave time trend, during
the period of analysis, which dominates any effect of fluctuations in the national economy.
Conversely, macroeconomic effects are overestimated when pooled data are utilized but state

fixed-effects are not controlled for.
There is no evidence that drinking or risky driving rises during economic downturns.

Instead, liquor consumption and alcohol-involved driving, as measured by either total or
night-time vehicle fatalities, vary procyclically. A large proportion of the total impact can be
traced to fluctuations in incomes, which demonstrates that drinking and driving are normal
goods. Although liquor may be used as self-medication for increased stress, in aggregate, this
effect is more than offset by lower incomes and (possibly) changes in relative prices.

Two other findings are noteworthy. First, the consumption of distilled spirits is more
sensitive to changes in the macroeconomy than is the drinking of either beer or wine. Second,
although youths have much higher vehicle death rates than their older counterparts, there is no
indication of greater responsiveness to economic conditions. Drinking patterns may explain
these results. During downturns, consumers are likely to shift to cheaper sources of alcohol -from hard liquor to wine and beer and from bars and restaurants to drinking in the home. These

Page 17

movements will be less pronounced for youths, since most of their liquor intake is of beer and on
an off-premise basis during all periods.
The investigation supplies strong evidence that economic conditions influence

alcohol-related health outcomes through their impact on personal incomes and ossibly) relative
prices. This finding may have implications for public policy.
