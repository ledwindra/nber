    "abstract": "\n\nThe paper studies the labor market participation of older workers in Belgium over the last 3 decades. It outlines the changes to the institutional framework of relevance for labor market participation and employment. Drawing on data from the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS) over the period 1983-2013, we provide evidence of the trends in participation in (early-) retirement routes. We also explore how the jobs occupied by older workers have changed over time, both in terms of their \u201cquality\u201d and the \u201cquantity\u201d of work involved. Part-time work is found to become more common, though with different attributes for men and women.\n\n",
