Employment and Occupational Advance
Under Affirmative Action

ABSTRACT

Affirmative Action is not only supposed to help move minorities and females into employment, it is also supposed to help move

them up the job ladder, and it is this second goal that is perhaps

the more controversial. Studies of Affirmative Action during the
late 1960's and early 1910's found it generally ineffective in the

white—collar and skilled occupations. Using disaggregated
employment data in a new sample of nearly 10,000 establishments,

this study finds that Affirmative Action was generally successful
during the late 1910's in increasing minority employment in skilled

white—collar occupations as well as in unskilled jobs.

To protest employment discrimination at the beginning of World War II, A. Philip

Randolph, President of the Sleeping Car Porters Union, threatened to disrupt the
defense effort by a mass demonstration of blacks in Washington D.C. on July 1, 1941.

Less than one week before the planned rally. President Roosevelt issued Executive
Order 3802 barring discrimination by federal contractors and the demonstration was
called off. The partial accommodation reached in the atmosphere of discord and crisis

of that Executive Order established the roots of a policy that I shall argue is today
bearing fruit; that policy is affirmative action.

One of the major affirmative action battlefields lies in the white-collar and craft

occupations. It is in these skilled positions that employers are most sensitive to pro-

ductivity differences and have complained the most about the burden of goals for
minority and female employment. It is also in this region of relatively inelastic supply

that the potential wage gains to members of protected groups are the greatest. The

handful of past studies in this area have unanimously concluded that affirmative
action has been ineffective in occupational upgrading and that the employment gains
it has engendered for minorities have been concentrated in low skill positions. For the

late nineteen-seventies this paper shall argue the opposite, using a new detailed set of

data on changes in establishment level demographics covering more than 16 million
employees between 1974 and 1980.

Four previous studies of affirmative action between 1966 and 1973 are reviewed in

Section 1, which then develops a model of affirmative action as a tax on white male

employment. Section 2 presents evidence of the impact of the contract compliance
program on total employment by race and sex. The third section discusses the main

findings on occupational advance under affirmative action. To show the impact of
affirmative action on occupational upgrading, three tests are presented in section 3.

First, a summary measure of occupational status, an occupational index, is constructed for each demographic group and its growth compared across contractor and

-2non-contractor establishments. If affirmative action is eective, the rclative occupational index for minorities and females should increase faster at the contractor esta'blishments that bear the affirmative action obligation. Second, to support the summary
evidence on occupational status, employment changes within detailed occupations are

analyzed. Third, to show the impact of occupational upgrading on earnings, wage
equations are estimated as a function of affirmative action pressure. The conclusions

of this study are presented in the final section, and the data underlying this research
are discussed in the appendix.
Section 1: The Framework for Analysis

Past Studies

All past studies of the impact of affirmative action on occupational advance- and

there have only been four- have found that while affirmative action increases total
black male employment among federal contractors, it does not increase their employ-

ment share in the skilled occupations. The first work on this subject, a study of 1186

establishments in 1967 and 1970 by Burman, found the employment impact of
affirmative action to be largest in clerical and operative occupations, and negative,

though insignificant, for managers. He also found that affirmative action had an
insignificant impact on an index of occupational status. A careful and extensive
analysis of 40455 establishments in 1966 and 1970 by Ashenfelter and Heckman
confirmed Burman's results. Affirmative action led to increases in black males' employ-

ment share, but this was largest and most significant among operatives. At the tops of

occupational ladders, black males share was estimated to fall relative to that of white

males in the contractor sector. Among officials and managers, and professionals, as
well as among service workers, this decline was significant. Overall, Ashenfelter and
Heckman found no significant impact of contractor status on the relative occupational

position of black workers. Similarly, for a sample of 74563 establishments between

-31970 and 1972, Goldstein and Smith foundno strong evidence of changes in occupa-

tional status under affirmative action. The most recent of the past studies, and in
many ways the most sophisticated econometrically, by Heckman and Wolpin of 3677

Chicago area establishments between 1972 and 1973, found that black male employ-

ment gains were concentrated in blue-collar occupations. They also found that con-

tractors utilized a greater proportion of white males, and fewer blacks and females
than did non-contractors in some white-collar occupations.

These four studies, all based on a comparison of EEO-1 forms at contractor and

non-contractor establishments in the early years of affirmative action, all agree that

affirmative action was ineffective in increasing the employment of black males in
skilled occupations. I shall present evidence that this had changed by the late seven-

ties. This difference may reflect the increasing supply of highly educated blacks, as

well as a more aggressive enforcement program, in particular the consolidation of

enforcement activities into the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
(OFCCP) in 1978.

A Model of Affirmative Action as a Tax

Affirmative action may be thought of as as a tax on the employment of white
males in the contractor sector. If they are immobile, white male workers bear the tax
burden and their relative wages fall.
Assume the owner of the firm maximizes utility:
MAX U = T(FKm))—T(WM)n—T(Wp)(1—m)—t(m—f)—d(1—rn)

where
T

= total employment

m=

t

d

a

production function with F'>O,F<O.

Abstracting from the scale effect by fixing T= 1, the first order condition is:

F'=WMWP'+t—d

(2)

from which we find:

m = g(W,Bp',t,d)
(3)
Intuitively, an increase in the affirmative action 'tax' shifts the demand curve for
white male labor down.

I assume fixed tastes for discrimination and fixed technology, or less restrictively,

technological change that is neither male nor female saving so that the change in
demand is a function only of wages and the tax. All firms are assumed to be wage takers in the same labor market, with the wage elasticity of labor demand the same in the

contractor and non-c ontractor sectors. Empirically, contractor and non- contractor
establishments show similar growth rates, so scale effects are likely to be similar. The

difference between the change in the employment of white males at contractor firms,
Amc, and at non-contractor firms, iim, is then simply a function of affirmative action

pressure.

employment of members of protected groups across contractor and non-contractor
establishments across time. If affirmative action has been effective, these employment

shifts will be greater among contractors. This measures the differential impact of
affirmative action over and above the effects of general policies, or changes in tastes.

Also, since any general supply shift will affect contractors and non-contractors alike,

-5this isolates the impact of affirmative action on labor demand.
Section 2: The Employment Effect or Affirmative Action

Before examining the impact of affirmative action on occupational advance, it is

helpful to analyze changes in total employment by demographic group. This section

presents the results of weighted least squares regressions of the change in share of

total employment by demographic group as a function of contractor status (C74),
review status (REVIEW), establishment size, growth rate, corporate structure, percent

non-clerical white-collar, industry, and region. The dependent variable is the change

in the employment share of the given demographic group1. These equations are
estimated on a longitudinal sample of 68690 establishments in 1974 and 1980 which is

discussed in the appendix. The sample means of the control variables, and the abbreviations by which they shall be referred in the following tables, are indicated in Table
4.1.

Table 4.2 shows that blacks' share of employment at contractor establishments

grew significantly more than at non-contractor establishments. Between 1974 and
1980, black males' employment share grew significantly more by .11 percentage points

at establishments that were contractors in 1974 than at non-contractors. This is an
increase of 1.4 percent of black males' initial 1974 employment share in the contrac-

tor sector of 7.3 percent, after six years under affirmative action. For black females,

contractor status was associated with a significant .14 percentage point increase in

employment share, or 3.6 percent of their initial 3.8 percent share of employment.
For white females, the increase was .25 percentage points, or 1.0 percent of their ini-

tial 24.4 percent share. Contractor establishments did not increase non-black minor-

ity employment significantly faster than non-contractors. White males, a summary
measure, did significantly worse at contractor establishments.
Table 4.2 also measures the impact of compliance reviews, conditional on contrac-

tor status. Compliance reviews contributed to significant percentage point increases

-6of .32 for black maics, .23 for non-black minority males, and .15 for black females, and

significantly retarded the growth in white male and white female representation.

Judging by the significant relative decline in white males' employment share at
reviewed establishments, compliance reviews have been effective in promoting blacks

and minority males, though at the same time they appear to have reduced white
females' share of employment2.

These estimates suggest an affirmative action program that works for blacks,
more so than for other protected groups3. Both male and female black employment

shares have increased faster at contractor establishments than at non-contractors,

and faster at contractors that have completed a compliance review than at nonreviewed contractors.
Section 3: Occupational Detail

Under Executive Order 11246, federal contractors have an obligation "to take

affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are

treated during employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or
national origin. Such actions shall include, but not be limited to the following: employ-

ment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff

or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship." [41 C.F.R. 169 202(1) (1974)]. The goal of affirmative

action is not merely to increase the employment of members of protected groups, but

to promote their advancement up the job ladder. A full evaluation of affirmative
action requires an examination not only of its effect on total employment, but also of
its impact across occupations.

Previous studies suggest that contractors have been able, in practice, to fulfill
their affirmative action obligations by hiring more blacks and females in relatively
unskilled positions. On this evidence, afTirmative action before 1974 appeared to have

been more effective in increasing employment than in promoting occupational

-7advancement. Some might argue that such a result is only to be expected given the
short supply of skilled minorities and females. The presumption behind affirmative
action however, is that trainable members of protected groups will be considered for

skilled employment. Even in the case of a small fixed supply, in its initial years
affirmative action should induce a reshuffling of skilled blacks and women from noncontractor to contractor firms, without any upgrading of individuals necessary.
In Table 4.3 the distribution of minorities and females across occupations is sum-

marized with an index of occupational status. This index weights the proportion of
-members of a given demographic group in an occupation by the 1969 mean earnings
by occupation of full-year employed males from the 1970 Census of Population. If the

within occupation variance of wages is small then changes in the occupational index

should explain a good deal of overall wage changes. If affirmative action has led to

blacks or females being employed in higher paying jobs, then this index should
increase faster at contractor firms, under conditions derived below.
The advance of black males under affirmative action does show up in net occupa-

tional upgrading. In Table 4.3, black males' occupational index relative to its 1974
value increases 2 percent more in contractor establishments than in non-contractors,
and an additional 1 percent in reviewed establishments.4 Relative to white males, black

males' occupational index has increased 1 percent during six years of affirmative
action5. In the equations for occupational index, employment growth by demographic

group is controlled for, along with establishment size, corporate structure, industry,

region, and lagged employment share. As expected, the higher the employment
growth, the lower the rate of occupational advance since many new entrants are at
the bottom of occupational ladders6.

Between 1974 and 1980, the ratio of black male to white male mean employment

income for full-time, full-year workers increased by 2.3 percent, from .684 to .700,

Since 69 percent of all employment in the study sample is in contractor establish-

-8ments, our results imply that about thirty percent of the increase in the relative
economic position of black males may be due to occupational advance induced by
affirmative action. While this does not include the effect of promotion within the broad

occupational categories used here, it is still likely to be an overestimate both because

the study sample probably overstates the proportion of total employment that is in

the contractor sector, and because part of the increase in the relative occupational
index is probably due to the movement of skilled blacks into the contractor sector,
rather than to the advance of blacks within the sector.
Occupational Detail and Occupational Indexes

While an occupational index provides a dramatic and succinct summary measure,

it can be misleading in isolation. For example, the occupational index would increase

if firms laid off unskilled blacks or women. This is related to the occupational twist
that some have argued affirmative action or anti-discrimination law might induce. To

guard against such misinterpretations, the occupational index should be used in conjunction with detailed employment data.

This potential false positive is balanced by a false negative. Any practical occupa-

tional index has only a finite level of detail. Much promotion could take place within

even detailed occupations. The broader the job classifications, the more upgrading
will take place within occupations and so be unobservable. At the extreme, affirmative

action could cause massive promotions, but only within job classifications, causing no
change at all in an index of occupational status. The initial effect of affirmative action

could be to lower the occupational index because new hires are typically hired into
jobs at the bottoms of the job ladders.

Even if affirmative action induces an increase in the employment of minorities
and females at the top of the job ladder, the occupational index may still decline due

to a composition effect. Since 64 of minority males are employed as operatives and
laborers, and 83 of females are employed as operatives, laborers and office workers,

-9oven small proportional employment increases in these occupations will account for a
large share of total employment.

To clarify these issues consider the following formalization of the relationship
between an occupational index and growth rates within occupations. An occupational
index is:
(14)

where

Z is the occupational index in year t
W is earnings in occupation i in a given fixed year

is the proportion of all workers of a given demographic group j who are employed
in occupation i in year t,

=

Taking the derivative with respect to time:

dZ

—

(15)

But the side condition on the shares is that:

(is)
So the occupational index can only increase over time if au increases in high wage

occupations. However, the occupational index of blacks can decline even though
black representation is growing in every occupation. Formally:

-10N5

(19)

To see how Z changes with changes in P, first totally difTerentiate:

dZt=EWda

Now

a = in N5 — In N5

(21)

So

din a = din N,5 — din

(22)

or

[din N5 — din N5 ]

(23)

So

dZg_—EWta[d1nN,j—dinN5]
To put this in terms of P , note that:

inN.jinN-i-inP

(24)

(25)

so
=

din

din N + din P

(26)

This gives us:

(27)
The

condition for no change in the occupational index is then that:
(28)

If d1nP>0

across all occupations. then this condition is more likely to hold if:

- 11

-

(1) dIn IV is negative.

(2) The covariances of W and a with din

are negative.

(3) din N5 is large and positive.

In words, the occupational index is more likely to remain unchanged even though
minority representation is increasing in all occupations if (1) total employment is declining; (2) earnings and share of minority employment are low where the greatest pro-

portional increases in minority share of employment are high (composition effect);
and (3) total employment of minorities is increasing.

What to make of all this? The lesson is not that the occupational index is not use-

ful; but that like any simplifying tool, its use without knowledge of its limitations is

potentially misleading. The occupational index is a dramatic and easily understood
summary measure, but the full story of the impact of affirmative action requires an
analysis of employment data within disaggregated occupations.
Employment Shifts Within Occupations

To test the impact of affirmative action within detailed occupations, I regress the
change in employment share on contractor and review status, establishment size, cor-

porate structure, industry, region, and growth of total employment for the given
demographic group, in samples of establishments reporting employment in nine occu-

pations and two trainee positions. These regressions are weighted by total initial
period employment within the given occupation. The key results from this mass of
information are condensed in a set of summary tables by demographic group, Tables

4.4 to 4.7. In these tables the coefficients on contractor and review status are
expressed as a percent of initial 1974 employment share. The evidence is most striking in the case of black males in Table 4.4. Tn every occupation except laborers and

white-collar trainees, black males' share of employment has increased faster in con-

tractor than in non-contractor establishments, and except for operatives and profes-

sionals these differences are significant. This impact is found in both the

-12proportionate change in black males' share of total employment, and in the proportionate change in the ratio of black male to white male share.

The marginal impact of a compliance review, conditional on contractor status is

also shown. The relative importance of being a contractor and of being a reviewed
contractor is mixed across occupations, but in every case, except blue-collar trainees

and clerks, reviewed establishments have increased black males' employment share
more than non-reviewed contractors.

The total impact of the contract compliance program, the weighted sum of con-

tractor and review efiects, shows some evidence of a twist in demand toward more

highly skilled black males. Since 17.4 percent of all contractor employment is in
reviewed establishments, the total impact is calculated as the sum of the contractor

eect and .174 times the review etTect. The contract compliance program has not
reduced the demand for black males in low skilled occupations. except for laborers. It

has raised the demand for black males more in the highly skilled white-collar and
craft jobs than in the blue-collar operative, laborer, and service occuaptions. While
this may help explain why highly skilled black males have been better ofl than their
less skilled brethren, it does not help explain why low skilled black males should be
having greater difficulty over the years in finding and holding jobs.

Affirmative action has also helped non-black minority males, although to a lesser

extent. Table 4.5 shows evidence of a twist in demand toward Hispanic, Asian, and
American Indian males in white-collar occupations, particularly in sales and clerical
positions, and away from this group in operative and laborer positions. Compliance

reviews have had a strong and significant additional impact in the professional,
managerial, and craft occupations. The total impact of the contract compliance pro-

gram on non-black minority males is positive in the white-collar, craft, and service
occupations, and in training programs. Relative to white males, affirmative action has
increased the occupational status of non-black minority males by 2 percent.

- 13 The

evidence in Table 4.8 suggests that the contract compliance program has had

a mixed, and often negative impact on white females. For technical, sales, clerical,
craft, and trainee workers, contractor status is associated with a significant decline in
white females employment share. Compliance reviews have also often had a negative

impact. While both contracts and reviews produce a significant one percent increase
in white females' occupational status, this positive impact disappears when changes in

white females' occupational status are compared to the relatively greater gains of
white males.

Table 4.7 shows that in contrast to whites, black females in contractor establish-

ments have increased their employment share in all occupations except technical,
craft, and white-collar trainee. Compliance reviews have had a mixed effect across
occupations. The positive impact of the contract compliance program is even more
marked when the position of black females is compared with that of white females.
Overall, black females' index of occupational status has increased 1. percent relative to

that of white females under affirmative action. With the same qualifications as in the

male case, this net movement across broad occupations may account for twenty percent of the 3.2 percent increase from .917 in 1974 to .946 in 1980 in the ratio of black
female to white female earnings observed in Bureau of the Census data.

The conclusion drawn from this detailed analysis of employment by occupation is

that with the exception of white females, affirmative action appears to have contributed to the occupational advance of members of protected groups. In particular, for
non-white males affirmative action has increased demand relatively more in the more

highly skilled occupations. The finding here that affirmative action has helped move

minorities up as well as in stands in contrast to past studies of the early years of
affirmative action which found no significant evidence of occupational upgrading.

- 14 The Impact on Racial Inequality in Earnings
As

affirmative action has increased the- demand for minorities it has increased

their earnings as well as their employment and occupational status. To directly meas-

ure wage effects I estimate log-linear wage equations using the May 1978 Current
Population Survey sample matched with data on the proportion of employment by
industry by SMSA that. was in contractor establishments in 1980. The CPS sample is
limited to males in non-agricultural employment in the 43 largest SMSA's who reported

weekly earnings, hours, and industry of employment. The log-wage equations are
stimated separately for white and non-white males, and control for the following personal characteristics: age and its square, years of schooling completed and its square,

marital and veteran status, and class of worker. Dummy variables for individual
SMSAs, SMSA size, and residence in the central city are also included. Occupation is

not controlled for because we are interested not in within occupation wage variation,
but in changes across occupations.

As the contractor sector's employment share increases by one standard devia-

tion, non-white male wages increase by eight percent compared to six percent for

white males. Both effects are significant, and the impact on non-white males is
significantly greater than that on white males according to an F-test across equations.

If the occupational upgrading estimated in this paper was due simply to occupational

reclassification in name only -title inflation-, then no such wage effect would be
expected. This cross-section evidence indicates that occupational advance under
affrmative action has contributed to the decline in racial earnings inequality. Black
male wages increase relatively more than those of white males in contractor intensive

industries. After 1974, affirmative action appears to have increased the employment
of non-white males in the more skilled and remunerative occupations8.

- 15 -

Section 4: Conc1uion

This paper has shown that affirmative action under Executive Order 11246 has
promoted the occupational advance of minorities of both sexes, as well as increasing

their employment among government contractors. For white females, the impact of

the program appears mixed, and more difficult to separate from concurrent supply
shifts. The finding of occupational advance for black males is reinforced by evidence
that affirmative action has narrowed the diITerence in earnings between the races.

If minorities and females do not share the skills and interests of white males, then

perhaps the best one can expect from an affirmative action program is to increase

their employment. But to the extent that minorities and females share the
qualifications and interests of white males, an effective affirmative action program
should improve their chances of sharing the same occupations too.

In the end, this is really a story about a reform that works despite generating
considerable resistance. But just a-s no policy works in isolation, so no policy can be
evaluated in isolation. Our major finding here is that affirmative action has increased

the demand for minorities in skilled jobs in the contractor sector. The relative
demand shift has been greater for skilled than unskilled workers. The success of this

program in skilled occupations after 1974, where none had been observed before, is
probably due in part to the increasing supply of skilled minorities in many fields, as

well as to the more aggressive use of sanctions after the early 197O's. The weaker
results for white females must be considered in light of the massive increase in female

labor supply that has led to increased female employment throughout the economy,
and which may have obscured the contractor effect. We have also seen minorities and

females enjoying the greatest gains at growing establishments, both contractor and
non-contractor. The lesson drawn is that affirmative action programs work best when

they are vigorously enforced, when they work with other policies that augment the
skills of members of protected groups, and when they work with growing employers.

NOTES

While my 2 years of data do not allow a test of serial correlation, Heckman and
Wolpin report significant evidence of positive serial correlation of errors on the

order of .9 in a similar data set. In cross-section estimates using levels with a
lagged dependent this is expected to bias downwards the short run impact of con-

tractor status in the case of black males. The results presented here use a first-

difference in the dependent variable which should reduce potential bias from

serial correlation of the magnitude previously reported. Th,e point estimates
reported here change in other specifications reported at length in other work,
particularly in the case of females, but these do not alter the main conclusions
drawn here.

2. On this evidence, compliance reviews appear to be more effective for blacks thati
for females. This does not mean that female employment is not improving among

the reviewed, but rather that it is improving faster among non-reviewed. In any
case, a weaker result for females than for minorities is consistent with compli-

ance reviews that ask for more than last year, rather than more than average,
during a period of rapidly increasing female labor supply.
3.

To determine the within industry, within region impact of affirmative action all of

the equations in Table 4.2 include 27 industry dummy variables and 4 region

dummy variables. Some of these variables had significant and large effects.

Southern establishments showed smaller increases in white male and white
female employment share. These estimates imply that black employment is grow-

ing faster in the South, and that racial discrimination is not obviously worse
there.
There is also significant variation in the growth of minority and female represen-

tation across industries. White males' employment share, a summary measure,
has grown significantly faster in mining, construction, lumber, paper, stone, clay

-17and glass, primary and fabricated metals, non-electrical machinery, transportation equipment, transportation, and public utilities. Black males' share has grown

significantly slower in apparel, non-electrical machinery, and miscellaneous
manufacturing. White females' share has grown significantly slower in agricul-

ture, construction, paper, primary metals, and transportation. Since region,

growth rate, and percent non-clerical white collar are controlled for, these
appear to reflect real differences across sectors in the growth of minority and
female representation.

Controlling for whether or not the establishment was part of a multiestablishment corporation — corporate status— reduces the difference between

contractor and non-contractor establishments. Establishments that were part of
larger corporations had significantly larger increases in female and black male

employment. Establishment size itself works in the opposite direction, black
males experienced significantly slower growth in representation at larger estab-

lishments. Establishments that are growing and so have many job openings

showed significant increases in minority and female representation. White
females, but not other groups, experienced significantly and substantially greater
employment growth at establishments that were white-collar intensive.

Other specifications not shown here tested for interactions of contractor and
review status with size, growth and initial minority or female representation.
There are few recurrent patterns. The data give no clear answer to the question

of how the impact of contractor status varies by the establishment's initial
employment of minorities and females. There is evidence that affirmative action
for black males has been more effective at male intensive establishments.
4.

The coefficients of interest here, on contractor and review status, do not change
significantly when the equations for black and white males are reestirnated on a

larger sample of 41660 establishments with just the restrictions that black male

- lB and white male employment be positive.
5.

This does not include within occupation promotions, which are substantial within

such broadly defined occupations. It also refers to the changing net position of
black males at the average establishment, not to the average career transition of

the average black male. In particular, since our unit of observation is the establishment, no individual black male need move to a higher occupation for the index

at the average contractor establishment to increase, if many highly skilled blacks

migrate into the contractor sector. Of course, it is very unlikely that all of the
increase in the occupational index is due to such cross-sector migration.
6

For all groups, the faster the growth in total employment, the lower the occupa-

tional status. This effect appears strongest for white females and for non-black
minority males. while it is weaker and less significant for white males and black

females. This coefficient measures the difference in occupational status of
members of a given demographic group across establishments with fast and slow

growth of that group. As such, attempts to use it for cross-group comparisons

must be interpreted with care. In particular, the mean occupational status of
each group must be considered. For example, while the effects of growth on
occupational status is relatively small for both white males and black females, a
plausible interpretation in the first case is that white male new entrants are being
employed in positions nearly as high as those of in place white males, while in the

second case a plausible interpretation is that black female new entrants are
being employed in, positions nearly as low as those in place. In each case the
coefficient tells us only how the occupational status differs from that of the average worker of the same group.

8. A companion paper addresses these wage equations at greater length. The wage
effects have been growing over time in both size and significance, as one might

expect from increasingly powerful enforcement. The contractor effect was
insignificant for white males in 1969, but significant for non-white males, and
significant for both in 1973. In both these previous years, the effect on non-white

males' earnings was significantly greater than on white males. If one puts great
weight on the previous employment studies, this may perhaps indicate a peculiar

omitted variable bias in the wage equations that differentially affects blacks and

that grows over time. Alternatively, these wage equations may indicate an
affirmative action program that since 1969 has helped reduce racial wage inequality and promoted black male occupational advance.

Appendix: Data

This study developed a new and detailed longitudinal data set based on establishment level demographic data from EEO-1 reports made available by the OFCCP's Divi-

sion of Program Analysis. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires annual

reports on workforce demographics from all private employers with 100 or more
employees, or 50 or more employers and a federal contract or first-tier subcontract
worth 50,000 or more. In the case of multi-plant employers, all establishments with

more than 24 employees that belong to firms fulfilling the above conditions must
report individually. Employers with small or temporary workforces such as construc-

tion, trade and agriculture are underrepresented.
From samples of roughly 160,000 establishments in 1980 and 100,000 establish-

ments in 1974 I found 68,690 establishments that filed identifiable reports in both
years. The empirical tests comparing contractors with non-contractors are based on

these 68,690 establishments with more than sixteen million employees from the
matched sample. The detailed occupational tests are based on subsamples reporting
positive employment within the occupation.

An establishment is considered a contractor if the company or any of its establishments are prime government contractors or first-tier subcontractors with a contract, subcontract or purchase order of $50,000 or more. Any such establishment is
identified as a contractor, whether or not the establishment so identified itself.

Contractors appear to have become better labeled over time. Twenty-seven per-

cent of all 1974 non-contractors were identified as contractors in 1980, constituting
seventeen percent of all 1980 contractors. Whether these status changes arc true, or
just an artifact of more accurate reporting, my results will be biased against finding
any affirmative action effect when I test according to 1974 status only.

To the extent that contractors may have selectively reclassified upwards black

and female intensive detailed occupations at a faster rate than did non-contractors,

- 23 -

this study and its predecessors will overstate the actual occupational advance due to

affirmative action. Of course pure reclassification would cause black losses in the
lower occupations, which is generally not observed.

To compare demographic changes across reviewed and non-reviewed establish-

ments I merged the matched 1974 and 1980 EEO-1 establishment demographic data
with data on OFCCP compliance reviews. OFCCP administrative records contain data
on 27,000 compliance reviews across 13.000 identifiable establishments, between 1973

and 1981. These are almost exclusively Department of Defense compliance reviews,
which account for nearly half of all reviews. Reviews completed prior to 1973 or after

1979 are underrepresented, and due to general under-reporting some establishments
that were reviewed will be included among the non-reviewed, biasing my tests against

finding an impact of compliance reviews. I labeled as reviewed any establishments
that had a record of at least one compliance review between 1975 and 1979 inclusive.

Multiple reviews are not rare, but are not controlled for in my tests. Since the mode
year of review completion in the sample is 1975, while demographic changes are meas-

ured between 1974 and 1980, there is little potential for underestimating review
eects due to lags in response.
