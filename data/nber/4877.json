    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the competition between two political parties for seats in a parliament.  The parliament will set two types of policies: ideological and non-ideological.  The parties have fixed positions on the ideological issues, but choose their non-ideological platforms to attract voters and campaign contributions.  In this context, we ask: How do the equilibrium contributions from special interest groups influence the platforms of the parties?  We show that each party is induced to behave as if it were maximizing a weighted sum of the aggregate welfares of informed voters and members of special interest groups.  The party that is expected to win a majority of seats caters more to the special interests.\n\n",
