1     Introduction
There is now a large and influential literature on the determinants of the aggregate
technical progress (see, among others, Romer (1990), Segerstrom, Anant and Dinopoulos
(1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), Aghion and Howitt (1992), Young (1993)). This
literature does not address questions related to the direction and bias of technical change.
In most situations, however, technical change is not neutral: it benefits some factors of
production more than others. In this paper, I develop a simple framework of directed
technical change to study these biases. In this framework, profit incentives determine
the amount of research and development directed at diﬀerent factors and sectors.
    To see the potential importance of the biases in technical change, consider a number
of examples:

    1. Figure 1 plots a measure of the relative supply of skills (number of college equiv-
      alent workers divided by noncollege equivalents) and a measure of the return to
      skills, the college premium. It shows that over the past 60 years, the U.S. relative
      supply of skills has increased rapidly, but there has been no tendency for the re-
      turns to college to fall in the face of this large increase in supply–on the contrary,
      there has been an increase in the college premium over this time period. The
      standard explanation for this pattern is that new technologies over the post-war
      period have been skill-biased. The figure also shows that beginning in the late
      1960s, the relative supply of skills increased much more rapidly than before, and
      the skill premium increased very rapidly beginning in the late 1970s. The standard
      explanation for this increase is an acceleration in the skill bias of technical change
      (e.g., Autor, Katz and Krueger, 1998).

    2. In contrast, technical change during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth cen-
      turies appears to have been unskill-biased (skill-replacing). The artisan shop was
      replaced by the factory and later by interchangeable parts and the assembly line
      (e.g., James and Skinner, 1985, Goldin and Katz, 1998).         Products previously
      manufactured by skilled artisans started to be produced in factories by workers


                                             1
     with relatively few skills, and many previously complex tasks were simplified, re-
     ducing the demand for skilled workers. According to Mokyr (1990, p. 137):“First
     in firearms, then in clocks, pumps, locks, mechanical reapers, typewriters, sewing
     machines, and eventually in engines and bicycles, interchangeable parts technology
     proved superior and replaced the skilled artisans working with chisel and file.”

  3. Over the past 150 years of growth, the prices of the two key factors, capital and
     labor, have behaved very diﬀerently. While, both in the U.S. and in other Western
     economies, the wage rate has increased steadily, the rental rate of capital has been
     approximately constant. As is well known in growth theory, this pattern indicates
     that most of the new technologies are labor-augmenting.

  4. Beginning in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, both unemployment and the
     share of labor in national income increased rapidly in a number of continental
     European countries. During the 1980s, unemployment continued to increase, but
     the labor share started a steep decline, and in many countries, ended up below
     its initial level. Blanchard (1997) interprets the first phase as the response of
     these economies to a wage-push by workers, and the second phase as a possible
     consequence of capital-biased technical change.

   These examples document a variety of important macroeconomic issues where biased
technical change plays a key role. They also pose a number of questions: why has
technical change been skill-biased over the past 60 years? Why was technical change
biased in favor of unskilled labor and against skilled artisans during the nineteenth
century? Why has there been an acceleration in the skill bias of technical change during
the past twenty-five years? Why is much of technological progress labor-augmenting
rather than capital-augmenting? Why was there rapid capital-biased technical change
in continental Europe following the wage-push by workers during the 1970s?
   These questions require a framework where the equilibrium bias of technical change
can be studied. The framework I present here builds on the existing endogenous technical
change models, in particular, the expanding product variety models of Romer (1990)


                                           2
and Grossman and Helpman (1991).1 It generalizes these theories to allow for technical
change to be directed towards diﬀerent factors: firms can invest resources to develop
technologies that complement a particular factor. The relative profitabilities of the
diﬀerent types of technologies determine the direction of technical change.
       I show that there are two competing forces determining the relative profitability of
diﬀerent types of innovation:

    • The price eﬀect: there will be stronger incentives to develop technologies when the
         goods produced by these technologies command higher prices.

    • The market size eﬀect: it is more profitable to develop technologies that have a
         larger market. This reiterates a point that Schmookler (1966) emphasized in his
         pioneering study, Invention and Economic Growth (p. 206): “invention is largely
         an economic activity which, like other economic activities, is pursued for gain;...
         expected gain varies with expected sales of goods embodying the invention.” In
         contrast to Schmookler, who stressed sector-specific innovations, my interest here
         is with the factor bias of innovations, so the relevant market size is the supply of
         the factor that will be combined with the new technology.

       These two eﬀects are competing because, while the price eﬀect implies that there will
be more rapid technological improvements favoring scarce factors, the market size eﬀect
creates a force towards innovations complementing the abundant factor.2 I will show
that the elasticity of substitution between the factors determines the relative strengths
of these two eﬀects. When the elasticity of substitution is low, scarce factors command
much higher prices, and the price eﬀect is relatively more powerful.
       The first major result of this framework is that irrespective of the elasticity of sub-
stitution between factors (as long as it is not equal to 1), an increase in the relative
   1
     Equivalently, I could use the quality ladder model as in Aghion and Howitt (1992)–see Acemoglu
(1998). The algebra turns out to be somewhat simpler with the expanding product variety model, which
motivates my choice here.
   2
     Another important determinant of the direction of technical change is the form of the “innovation
possibilities frontier”–i.e., how the relative costs of innovation are aﬀected as technologies change. I
discuss the impact of the innovation possibilities frontier on the direction of technical change in Section
4.


                                                    3
abundance of a factor creates some amount of technical change biased towards that fac-
tor. The second major result is that if the elasticity of substitution is suﬃciently large
(in particular, greater than a certain threshold between 1 and 2), the induced bias in
technology can overcome the usual substitution eﬀect and increase the relative reward to
the factor that has become more abundant. That is, directed technical change can make
the long-run relative demand curve slope up. The long-run relative demand curve may
be upward sloping in this set-up because of the underlying “increasing returns to scale”
in the R&D process: a new machine, once invented, can be used by many workers.3
      Figure 2 illustrates these results diagrammatically. The relatively steep downward-
sloping lines show the constant technology relative demand curves. The economy starts
at point A. In the absence of endogenous technical change, the increase in the supply
shown in the figure moves the economy along the constant technology demand to point
B. The first result of this framework implies that, as long as the elasticity of substitution
between factors is not equal to 1, the increase in the supply will induce biased technical
change and shift the constant technology demand curve out. The economy will therefore
settle to a point like C. In other words, the (long-run) endogenous technology demand
curve will be flatter than the constant technology curve. The second result implies that
the induced bias in technology can be powerful enough to create a suﬃciently large shift
in the constant technology demand curve and take the economy to a point like D. In
this case, the endogenous technology demand curve of the economy is upward sloping
and the relative reward of the factor that has become more abundant increases.
      After outlining the general forces shaping the direction of technical change and de-
riving the main results, I return to a number of applications of this framework. I discuss:

  1. Why technical change over the past 60 years was skill-biased, and why skill-biased
        technical change may have accelerated over the past twenty-five years. Also why
        new technologies introduced during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth cen-
        turies were labor-biased.

  2. Why biased technical change is likely to increase the income gap between rich and
  3
      This is related to the nonrivalry in the use of ideas emphasized by Romer (1990).


                                                    4
         poor countries.

   3. Why international trade may induce skill-biased technical change.

   4. Under what circumstances labor scarcity will spur faster technological progress as
         suggested by Rothbarth (1946) and Habakkuk (1962).

   5. Why technical change tends to be generally labor-augmenting rather than capital-
         augmenting.

   6. Why a large wage-push, as in continental Europe during the 1970s, may cause
         capital-biased technical change and aﬀect the factor distribution of income.

       This list is by no means exhaustive, and there is much research to be done to under-
stand the implications of biased technical change and the determinants of equilibrium
bias of new technologies. It is part of my aim in this paper to stress the importance of
thinking about biased technical change, and to provide a set of tools that are likely to
be useful for future research on these biases.
       Although there is relatively little current research on biased technical change, an
earlier literature was devoted to studying related issues. It was probably Hicks in The
Theory of Wages (1932) who first discussed the determinants of equilibrium bias.4 He
wrote:

         “A change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur
         to invention, and to invention of a particular kind–directed to economizing
         the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive.” (pp. 124-5).

Hicks’ reasoning, that technical change would attempt to economize on the more expen-
sive factor, was criticized by Salter (1960) who pointed out that there was no particular
reason for saving on the more expensive factor–firms would welcome all cost reductions.
Moreover, the concept of “more expensive factor” did not make much sense, since all
factors were supposed to be paid their marginal product.
   4
   Marx also touched on these issues. He argued that labor scarcity–the exhaustion of the reserve
army of labor–would induce the capitalist to substitute machinery for labor and spur growth. See for
example the discussion in Habakkuk (1962, p. 44).

                                                 5
   These questions were revived by the “induced innovation” literature of the 1960s.
An important paper by Kennedy (1964) introduced the concept of “innovation possi-
bilities frontier” and argued that it is the form of this frontier–rather than the shape
of a given neoclassical production function–that determines the factor distribution of
income. Kennedy, furthermore, argued that induced innovations would push the econ-
omy to an equilibrium with a constant relative factor share (see also Samuelson, 1965,
and Drandakis and Phelps, 1965). Around the same time, Habakkuk (1962) published
his important treatise, American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century: the
Search for Labor Saving Inventions, where he argued that labor scarcity and the search
for labor saving inventions were central determinants of technological progress (see also
Rothbarth, 1946). The flavor of Habakkuk’s argument was one of induced innovations:
labor scarcity increased wages, which in turn encouraged labor-saving technical change.
   This whole literature was also criticized for lack of micro-foundations. First, with
specifications as in Kennedy, the production function at the firm level exhibited in-
creasing returns to scale because, in addition to factor quantities, firms could choose
“technology quantities”. Second, as pointed out by Nordhaus (1973), it was not clear
who undertook the R&D activities and how they were financed and priced. These short-
comings reduced the interest in this literature, and there was little research for almost
30 years, with the exception of some empirical work, such as that by Hayami and Ruttan
(1970) on technical change in American and Japanese agriculture.
   The analysis here, instead, starts from the explicit microfoundations laid out by the
endogenous technical change models. In addition to providing an equilibrium framework
for analyzing these issues, I demonstrate the presence of the market size eﬀect, which did
not feature in the earlier literature. More explicitly, the framework I present here syn-
thesizes previous work I did in Acemoglu (1998, 1999a, b) and Acemoglu and Zilibotti
(2001), as well as work by Kiley (1999) (see also Lloyd-Ellis, 1999, for a diﬀerent per-
spective). The results in these papers show that whether technical change results from
quality improvements, expanding variety of products, or expanding variety of machine
types is not essential. For this reason, I choose one of the specifications and highlight
the modeling choice that turns out to be more important–the form of the innovation


                                            6
possibilities frontier.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I define some of
the terms that will be used throughout the paper and clarify the distinction between
factor-augmenting and factor-biased technical change. In this section, I also give a
brief overview of the main results. In Section 3, I introduce the basic framework that
determines the demand for innovation and I highlight the price and market size eﬀects
on the direction of technical change. Section 4 introduces the innovation possibilities
frontier and shows how diﬀerent forms of this frontier will aﬀect equilibrium bias of
technology. Sections 5 and 6 apply the framework developed in Sections 3 and 4 to a
variety of situations where biased technical change appears to be important. Section 7
concludes.


2     Factor-Augmenting, Factor-Biased Technical Change
      and An Overview
This section defines some terms that will be used throughout the paper and gives a basic
overview.
    Consider an aggregate production function, F (L, Z, A), with two inputs, L, labor,
and Z, which could be capital, skilled labor or land. A is a technology index. Without
loss of generality imagine that ∂F/∂A > 0, so a greater level of A corresponds to “better
technology” or to “technological progress”. Technical change is L-augmenting if
                                      ∂F   L ∂F
                                         ≡      ,
                                      ∂A   A ∂L
which is equivalent to the production function taking the more special form F (AL, Z).
Z-augmenting technical change is defined similarly.
    Technical change is L-biased, on the other hand, if
                                        ∂F/∂L
                                      ∂ ∂F/∂Z
                                                 > 0,
                                        ∂A
that is, if technical change increases the marginal product of L more than the marginal
product of Z.

                                             7
      To clarify the diﬀerence between these two concepts, consider the more specialized
constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function
                            h         σ−1
                                                              i σ
                                                           σ−1 σ−1
                         y = γ (AL L)  σ  + (1 − γ) (AZ Z)  σ      ,

where AL and AZ are two separate technology terms, γ ∈ (0, 1) is a distribution pa-
rameter which determines how important the two factors are, and σ ∈ (0, ∞) is the
elasticity of substitution between the two factors. When σ = ∞, the two factors are
perfect substitutes, and the production function is linear. When σ = 1, the production
function is Cobb-Douglas, and when σ = 0, there is no substitution between the two
factors, and the production function is Leontieﬀ. When σ > 1, I refer to the factors as
gross substitutes, and when σ < 1, I refer to them as gross complements.5
      By construction, AL is L-augmenting and AZ is Z-augmenting. I will also sometimes
refer to AL as labor-complementary, since in the model of Section 3, AL will correspond
to machines that are used by labor. Similarly, I refer to AZ as Z-complementary.
      Whether technical change is labor-biased or Z-biased, on the other hand, depends
on the elasticity of substitution. To see this, calculate the relative marginal product of
the two factors:                              µ         ¶ σ−1 µ ¶− σ1
                             M PZ   1−γ            AZ      σ   Z
                                  =                                   .                       (1)
                             M PL    γ             AL          L
The relative marginal product of Z is decreasing in the relative abundance of Z, Z/L.
This is the usual substitution eﬀect, leading to a downward-sloping relative demand
curve. The eﬀect of AZ on this relative marginal product depends on σ, however. If
σ > 1, an increase in AZ (relative to AL ) increases the relative marginal product of Z.
When σ < 1, an increase in AZ reduces the relative marginal product of Z. Therefore,
when the two factors are gross substitutes, Z-augmenting (Z-complementary) technical
change is also Z-biased. In contrast, when the two factors are gross complements, then
  5
    I choose this terminology because the demand for Z increases in response to an increase in the
price of L, holding its price and the quantity of L constant if and only if σ > 1, and vice versa.

Z-augmenting technical change is L-biased. Naturally, when σ = 1, we are in the Cobb-
Douglas case, and neither a change in AZ nor in AL is biased towards any of the factors.
   The intuition for why, when σ < 1, Z-augmenting technical change is L-biased is
simple: with gross complementarity, an increase in the productivity of Z increases the
demand for the other factor, labor, by much more, eﬀectively creating “excess demand”
for labor. As a result, the marginal product of labor increases by more than the marginal
product of Z.
   Now to obtain an overview of the results that will follow, imagine a setup where AL
and AZ are determined endogenously from the type and quality of machines supplied by
“technology monopolists”. One of the major results of the more detailed analysis below
will be that the profitability of developing new Z-complementary machines relative to
the profitability of labor-complementary machines will be proportional to (see equation
(20))
                                   µ ¶− σ1 µ ¶ σ−1

                                  AL        L
The basic premise of the approach here is that profit incentives determine what types
of innovations will be developed. So when (2) is high, AZ will increase relative to AL .
Inspection of (2) shows that when the two factors are gross substitutes (σ > 1), an
increase in Z/L will increase the relative profitability of inventing Z-complementary
technologies. To equilibriate innovation incentives, AZ /AL has to rise, reducing (2)
back to its original level. Intuitively, in this case, of the two forces discussed in the
introduction, the market size eﬀect is more powerful than the price eﬀect, so technical
change is directed towards the more abundant factor. In contrast, when the two factors
are gross complements (σ < 1), an increase in Z/L will lead to a fall in AZ /AL . However,
recall that when σ < 1, a lower AZ /AL corresponds to Z-biased technical change. So
in this case an increase in Z/L reduces the relative physical productivity of factor Z,
but increases its relative value of marginal product, because of relative price changes.
Therefore, in both cases (i.e., as long as σ 6= 1) an increase in the relative abundance of
Z causes Z-biased technical change.
   We will also see that if σ is suﬃciently large, this induced biased technical change can
be so powerful that the increase in the relative abundance of a factor may in fact increase

                                            9
its relative reward–i.e., the long-run relative demand curve for a factor may be upward
sloping. Finally, depending on the form of the innovation possibilities frontier (i.e., the
relative costs of diﬀerent types of innovations) and the elasticity of substitution, the
induced technical change may create a force that either increases, decreases or stabilizes
the income share of the factor that has become more abundant.


3     The Demand Side
I now develop the basic framework for analyzing the determinants of the factor bias
of technical change. The framework is a synthesis of the models in Acemoglu (1998,
1999a,b), Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) and Kiley (1999), and builds on the standard
endogenous technical change models (e.g., Romer, 1990, Grossman and Helpman, 1991,
Aghion and Howitt, 1992). In this section, the focus is on the demand for new technology
(innovation). The next section then introduces “the innovation possibilities frontier” and
discusses the supply side of innovations.

3.1     The Environment
Consider an economy that admits a representative consumer6 with the usual constant
relative risk aversion (CRRA) preferences
                                 Z∞
                                      C 1−θ − 1 −ρt
                                               e dt,                                               (3)
                                        1−θ
                                 0

where ρ is the rate of time preference and θ is the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion (or
the intertemporal elasticity of substitution). I suppress the time arguments to simplify
the notation, and I will do so throughout as long as this causes no confusion. The budget
constraint of the consumer is:

                            C + I + R ≤ Y ≡ [γYLα + (1 − γ)YZα ]1/α                                (4)
   6
     Since with CRRA utility functions, individual preferences can be aggregated into a CRRA represen-
tative consumer, whether there are diﬀerent types of workers or not is not essential. See, for example,
Caselli and Ventura (2000).



                                                  10
where I denotes investment, and R is total R&D expenditure, if any. I also impose the
usual no-Ponzi game condition, requiring the lifetime budget constraint of the represen-
tative consumer to be satisfied. The production function in (4) implies that consumption,
investment and R&D expenditure come out of an output aggregate produced from two
other (intermediate) goods, YL and YZ , with elasticity of substitution ε ≡ 1/(1 − α)
where −∞ < α ≤ 1, and γ is a distribution parameter which determines how important
the two goods are in aggregate production. Of the two intermediates, YL is (unskilled)
labor-intensive, while YZ uses another factor, Z, intensively. In this section and the
next, I will not be specific about what this factor is, but the reader may want to think
of it as skilled labor for concreteness.7
    The two intermediate goods have the following production functions8

where β ∈ (0, 1), and L and Z are the total supplies of the two factors, assumed to
be supplied inelastically for now.9 The labor-intensive good is therefore produced from
labor and a range of labor-complementary machines. xL (j) denotes the amount of the j-
th labor-complementary machine used in production. The range of machines that can be

     This specification also introduces a distinction between the final good, Y , and the two intermediate
goods. This distinction is only useful for exposition, enabling me to use actual relative prices (rather
than shadow prices) to give the intuition. None of the results in the paper depend on it.
   Moreover, in this basic framework, there is no distinction between factor-specific and sector-specific
technical change. The key to the results is the factor bias of technical change, not its sector bias. In
the Appendix, I outline a more general model with both sector- and factor-specific technical change,
and show that the same forces determine equilibrium factor bias.
   8
     The firm level production functions are also assumed to be constant returns to scale, so there is no
loss of generality in focusing on the aggregate production functions.
   9
     A somewhat more general formulation which leads to similar results is
                                               ÃZ                      ! 1−β

                                       1−β          0

and similarly for YZ . The formulation in the text corresponds to the special case where v = 1 − β. This
simplifies the algebra without any loss of generality.



                                                        11
used with labor is denoted by NL . The production function for the other intermediate,
(6), uses Z-complementary machines and is explained similarly. Notice that given NL
and NZ , the production functions (5) and (6) exhibit constant returns to scale. There
will be aggregate increasing returns, however, when NL and NZ are endogenized.
       I assume that machines in both sectors are supplied by “technology monopolists”.
In this section, I take NL and NZ as given, and in the next section, I analyze the
innovation decisions of these monopolists (the supply of innovations) to determine NL
and NZ . Each monopolist sets a rental price χL (j) or χZ (j) for the machine it supplies
to the market. For simplicity, I assume that all machines depreciate fully after use, and
that the marginal cost of production is the same for all machines and equal to ψ in terms
of the final good.10
       The important point to bear in mind is that the set of machines used in the production
of the two intermediate goods are diﬀerent, allowing technical change to be biased. As
in models of technical change based on expanding product variety (e.g., Romer, 1990,
Grossman and Helpman, 1991), the range of machines, NL and NZ , will determine
aggregate productivity. In addition, NZ /NL will determine the relative productivity of
factor Z.

3.2       Equilibrium
An equilibrium (given NL and NZ ) is a set of prices for machines, χL (j) or χZ (j),
that maximize the profits of technology monopolists, machine demands from the two
intermediate goods sectors, xL (j) or xZ (j), that maximize intermediate good producers
profits, and factor and product prices, wL , wZ , pL , and pZ , that clear markets. I now
characterize this equilibrium and show that it is unique. The levels of NL and NZ will
be determined in the next section once I introduce the innovation possibilities frontier
of this economy.
  10
    Slow depreciation of machines does not change the balanced growth path equilibrium, and only
aﬀects the speed of transitory dynamics. For example, if machines depreciate at some exponential
rate δ, monopolists will produce the required stock of machines after the discovery of the new variety,
and then will replace the machines that depreciate. The rental price will then be a markup over the
opportunity cost of machines rather than over the production cost.



                                                  12
   The product markets for the two intermediates are competitive, so market clearing
implies that their relative price, p, has to satisfy

where recall that ε ≡ 1/(1 − α). The greater the supply of YZ relative to YL , the lower
is its relative price, p. The response of the relative price to the relative supply depends
on the elasticity of substitution, ε.
   I choose the price of the final good as the numeraire, so

                                    γp1−ε
                                      L   + (1 − γ)p1−ε
                                                    Z   = 1.                            (8)

   Since product markets are competitive, firms in the labor-intensive sector solve the
following maximization problem
                                                      Z       NL

taking the price of their product, pL , and the rental prices of the machines, denoted by
χL (j), as well as the range of machines, NL , as given. The first-order conditions for the
problem (9) give the following machine demands:
                                        µ        ¶1/β
                                           pL
                               xL (j) =               L.                               (10)
                                          χL (j)
This equation implies that the desired amount of machine use is increasing in the price
of the product, pL , and in the firm’s employment, L, and is decreasing in the price of
the machine, χL (j). Intuitively, a greater price for the product increases the value of
the marginal product of all factors, including machines, encouraging firms to rent more
machines. A greater level of employment, on the other hand, implies more workers to
use the machines, raising demand. Finally, because the demand curve for machines is
downward sloping, a higher cost implies lower demand.
   Next, the first-order condition with respect to L gives the equilibrium wage rate for
unskilled workers as

       The maximization problem facing firms in the Z-intensive sector is similar to (9) and
yields machine demands identical to (10):

       My interest is with the determinants of the direction of technical change. As discussed
above, profit-maximizing firms will generate more innovations in response to greater
profits, so the first step is to look at the profits of the technology monopolists. Recall
that each monopolist faces a marginal cost of producing machines equal to ψ. Therefore,
the profits of a monopolist supplying labor-intensive machine j can be written as π L (j) =
(χL (j) − ψ) xL (j). Since the demand curve for machines facing the monopolist, (10),
is iso-elastic, the profit-maximizing price will be a constant markup over marginal cost:
              ψ
χL (j) =     1−β
                 .   To simplify the algebra, I normalize the marginal cost to ψ ≡ 1 − β.11
This implies that in equilibrium all machine prices will be given by

                                        χL (j) = χZ (j) = 1.

Using this price and machine demands given by (10) and (12), profits of technology
monopolists are obtained as
                                           1/β                   1/β
                                 π L = βpL L and πZ = βpZ Z.                                        (14)

What is relevant for the monopolists is not the instantaneous profits, but the net present
discounted value of all profits. This net present discounted value can be expressed using
a standard dynamic programming equation:

                               rVL − V̇L = πL and rVZ − V̇Z = π Z ,                                 (15)

where r is the interest rate, which is potentially time-varying. This equation relates the
present discounted value of future profits, V , to the flow of profits, π. The V̇ term takes
  11
    This is without loss of any generality, since I am not interested in comparative statics with respect
to β.

                                                   14
care of the fact that future profits may not equal current profits, for example because
prices are changing.
   To gain intuition, let us start with a steady state where the V̇ terms are 0 (i.e.,
profits and the interest rate are constant in the future). Then,
                                     1/β                1/β

                                    r            r
The greater VZ is relative to VL , the greater are the incentives to develop Z-complementary
machines, NZ , rather than labor-complementary machines, NL . Inspection of (16) re-
veals two forces determining the direction of technical change:

  1. The price eﬀect: there will be a greater incentive to invent technologies producing
     more expensive goods, as shown by the fact that VZ and VL are increasing in pZ
     and pL .

  2. The market size eﬀect: a larger market for the technology leads to more innovation.
     Since the market for a technology is eﬀectively the workers who use it, the market
     size eﬀect encourages innovation for the more abundant factor. This can be seen
     from the fact that VL and VZ are increasing in Z and L, the total supplies of the
     factors combined with these technologies.

   Notice that an increase in the relative factor supply, Z/L, will create both a market
size eﬀect and a price eﬀect. The latter simply follows from the fact that an increase in
Z/L will reduce the relative price p ≡ pZ /pL . Equilibrium bias in technical change–
whether technical change will favor relatively scarce or abundant factors– is determined
by these two opposing forces. An additional determinant of equilibrium bias is the form
of the innovation possibilities frontier, which will be introduced in the next section.
   This discussion emphasizes the role of price and market size eﬀects, while factor prices
do not feature in (16). The early induced innovations literature, instead, argued that
innovations would be directed at “more expensive” factors (e.g., Hicks, 1932, Fellner,
1961, Habakkuk, 1962). Using equations (10), (11), (12), and (13), we can reexpress
(16) as
                              (1 − β) wL L          (1 − β) wZ Z
                       VL =                and VZ =              .                    (17)
                                  rNL                   rNZ

                                            15
This expression shows that an equivalent way of looking at the incentives to develop
new technologies is to emphasize factor costs, wL and wZ (as well as market sizes, L and
Z). As conjectured by the induced innovations literature, there will be more innovation
directed at factors that are more expensive.
   Next, it is useful to investigate the strength of the price and market size eﬀects in
more detail. To do this, let us substitute (10) and (12) into the production functions,
(5) and (6). This gives:
                         1   (1−β)/β                1 (1−β)/β
                 YL =       pL       NL L and YZ =    p       NZ Z.                  (18)
                        1−β                        1−β Z
Substituting these into (7) and using some algebra, we obtain the relative price of the
two intermediates simply as a function of relative technology, NZ /NL , and the relative
factor supply, Z/L:
                                  µ          ¶βε/σ µ             ¶−β/σ
                                      1−γ                 NZ Z
                             p=                                          ,           (19)
                                       γ                  NL L
where ε ≡ 1/ (1 − α) is the elasticity of substitution in consumption between the two
intermediate goods, YL and YZ , while σ is the elasticity of substitution between the two
factors, Z and L. In particular, σ is defined as
                                            1 − α (1 − β)
                                      σ≡                  .
                                                1−α
and is derived from the elasticity of substitution between the two goods, and σ > 1 if
and only if ε > 1 or α > 0–that is, the two factors are gross substitutes only if the two
intermediate goods are gross substitutes.
   Now using (16) and (19), we can write the relative profitability of creating new
Z-complementary machines as (still assuming steady state):
                                  µ         ¶ σε µ        ¶− σ1 µ ¶ σ−1
                           VZ         1−γ            NZ          Z σ
                              =                                         .            (20)
                           VL          γ             NL          L

This expression shows that an increase in the relative factor supply, Z/L, will increase
VZ /VL as long as the elasticity of substitution between factors, σ, is greater than 1 and
it will reduce VZ /VL if σ < 1. Therefore, the elasticity of substitution between the two
intermediate goods regulates whether the price eﬀect dominates the market size eﬀect so

                                                16
that there are greater incentives to improve the (physical) productivity of scarce factors,
or whether the market size eﬀect dominates, creating greater incentives to improve the
productivity of abundant factors. When the intermediate goods are gross substitutes,
the market size eﬀect dominates. And when they are gross complements, the price eﬀect
dominates.
   Finally, to see another important role that the elasticity of substitution between the
two goods plays, consider the relative factor rewards, wZ /wL . Using equations (10),
(11), (12), and (13) and then substituting for (19), we have
                                      µ         ¶ σε µ        ¶ σ−1
                                                                 σ
                                                                    µ ¶− σ1
                    wZ        NZ          1−γ            NZ          Z
                       = p1/β    =                                          .         (21)
                    wL        NL           γ             NL          L

First, note that the relative factor reward, wZ /wL , is decreasing in the relative factor
supply, Z/L. This is simply the usual substitution eﬀect: the more abundant factor is
substituted for the less abundant one, and has a lower marginal product.
   As was the case with the goods, the two factors are gross substitutes when σ > 1.
We also see from equation (21) that the same combination of parameters, (σ − 1) /σ,
which determines whether innovation for more abundant factors is more profitable also
determines whether a greater NZ /NL increases wZ /wL : when σ > 1, it does, but when
σ < 1, it has the opposite eﬀect and reduces the reward of the Z-factor relative to
labor. This is because NZ /NL is the relative physical productivity of the two factors,
not their relative value of marginal product. The latter also depends on the elasticity
of substitution between the two factors (recall equation (1) in Section 2). Therefore, as
in Section 2, Z-biased technical change corresponds to an increase in (NZ /NL )(σ−1)/σ ,
not simply to an increase in NZ /NL . Consequently, when σ < 1, a decrease in NZ /NL
corresponds to Z-biased technical change. This feature, that the relationship between
relative physical productivity and the value of marginal product is reversed when the
two goods (factors) are gross complements, will play an important role in the discussion
below.

4     The Supply of Innovations: The Innovation Pos-
      sibilities Frontier
The previous section outlined how the production side of the economy determines the re-
turn to diﬀerent types of innovation–the demand for innovation. The other side of this
equation is the cost of diﬀerent innovations, or using the term introduced by Kennedy
(1964), the “innovation possibilities frontier”. The analysis in this section will reveal
that in addition to the elasticity of substitution, the form of the innovation possibilities
frontier–more specifically the degree of state-dependence–will have an important ef-
fect on the direction of technical change. The degree of state-dependence relates to how
future relative costs of innovation are aﬀected by the current composition of R&D (cur-
rent “state” of R&D). I refer to the innovation possibilities frontier as “state-dependent”
when current R&D directed at factor Z reduces the relative cost of Z-complementary
R&D in the future.
    To start with, I follow the endogenous growth literature in limiting attention to
innovation possibilities frontiers that allow steady growth in the long run. I consider
the case without sustained growth later. Sustained growth requires that the innovation
possibilities frontier takes one of two forms. The first, which Rivera-Batiz and Romer
(1991) refer to as the lab equipment specification, involves only the final good being used
in generating new innovations. With this specification, steady-state growth is generated
with an intuition similar to the growth model of Rebelo (1991) whereby the key accumu-
lation equation is linear and does not employ the scarce (non-accumulated) factors, such
as labor. The second possibility is the knowledge-based R&D specification of Rivera-
Batiz and Romer (1991) where spillovers from past research to current productivity are
necessary to sustain growth. It is useful to distinguish between these two formulations
because they naturally correspond to diﬀerent degrees of state-dependence in R&D.




                                            18
4.1       The Direction of Technical Change with the Lab Equip-
          ment Model
Consider the following production function for new machine varieties

                                 ṄL = η L RL and ṄZ = ηZ RZ ,                                  (22)

where RL is spending on R&D for the labor-intensive good (in terms of final good),
and RZ is R&D spending for the Z-intensive good. The parameters η L and η Z al-
low the costs of these two types of innovations to diﬀer. The innovation production
functions in (22) imply that one unit of final good spent for R&D directed at labor-
complementary machines will generate ηL new varieties of labor-complementary ma-
chines (and similarly, one unit of final good directed at Z-complementary machines will
generate η Z new machine types). A firm that discovers a new machine variety receives a
perfectly enforced patent on this machine and becomes its sole supplier–the technology
monopolist. Notice that with the specification in (22), there is no state-dependence:
³          ´ ³          ´
 ∂ ṄZ /∂RZ / ∂ ṄL /∂RL = η Z /η L is constant irrespective of the levels of NL and NZ .
       I start with a balanced growth path (BGP)–or steady-state equilibrium–where the
prices pL and pZ are constant, and NL and NZ grow at the same rate. This implies that
the V̇ terms in equation (15) are 0, and VZ /VL is constant. Moreover, this ratio has
to be equal to the (inverse) ratio of η’s from (22) so that technology monopolists are
willing to innovate for both sectors. This immediately implies the following “technology
market clearing” condition:12
                                          η L π L = η Z π Z.                                     (23)

This condition requires that it is equally profitable to invest money to invent labor-
and Z-complementary machines, so that along the balanced growth path NL and NZ
can both grow. Defining η ≡ ηZ /η L to simplify notation and using (14) and (19), this
technology market clearing condition can be solved for
                                      µ      ¶ε µ ¶σ−1
                            NZ      σ   1−γ      Z
                                =η                     ,                                         (24)
                            NL           γ        L
  12
    This assumes no corner solution in which R&D is only directed to one of the factors. This does not
rule out the economy converging to a long-run equilibrium with only one type of innovation.


                                                 19
where recall that ε ≡ 1/ (1 − α) is the elasticity of substitution between the two inter-
mediates and σ ≡ (1 − α (1 − β)) / (1 − α) is the elasticity of substitution between the
two factors. Equation (24) shows that with the direction of technical change endoge-
nized, the relative bias of technology, NZ /NL , is determined simply by the relative factor
supply and the elasticity of substitution between the two factors.
       First, consider the case in which σ > 1, so that the two factors are gross substitutes.
Then, an increase in Z/L will raise NZ /NL , hence the physical productivity of abundant
factors tends to be higher. Moreover, since σ > 1, a higher level of NZ /NL will also
correspond to Z-biased technical change. Therefore, technology will be endogenously
biased in favor of the more abundant factor.
       In the case where the two factors are gross complements, i.e., when σ < 1, equation
(24) implies that NZ /NL is lower when Z/L is higher. Nevertheless, because σ < 1, this
lower relative physical productivity translates into a higher value of marginal product.
Therefore, even when σ < 1, technology will be endogenously biased in favor of the more
abundant factor.
       The exception to this result is when σ = 1, i.e., when the production function is
Cobb-Douglas. In this case, the elasticity of substitution between the two intermediates
is equal to 1, and technical change is never biased towards one of the factors.13
       Next consider factor prices. Using equations (21) and (24), we obtain
                                           µ      ¶ε µ ¶σ−2
                                wZ     σ−1   1−γ       Z
                                    =η                        .                                  (25)
                                wL            γ        L
       Comparing this equation to (21), which specified the relative factor prices as a func-
tion of relative supplies and technology, we see that the response of relative factor re-
wards to changes in relative supply is always more elastic in (25): σ − 2 > −1/σ. This is
not surprising given the LeChatelier principle, which states that demand curves become
more elastic when other factors adjust. Here, the “other factors” correspond to the
machine varieties NL and NZ .
       The more surprising result here is that if σ is suﬃciently large, in particular if σ > 2
(i.e., if α (1 + β) > 1), the relationship between relative factor supplies and relative
  13
    Naturally, diﬀerent types of technical change might aﬀect γ, and therefore the marginal product of
the two factors diﬀerently.

                                                 20
factor rewards can be upward sloping. I will discuss the relevance of this result later.
Intuitively, with exogenous technology when a factor becomes more abundant, its relative
reward falls: i.e., given NZ /NL , wZ /wL is unambiguously decreasing in Z/L due to the
usual substitution eﬀect (see equation (21)). Yet, because technology is endogenously
biased towards more abundant factors, the overall eﬀect of factor abundance on factor
rewards is ambiguous.
       Next define the relative factor shares as
                                                µ      ¶ µ ¶
                            sZ     wZ Z     σ−1   1 − γ ε Z σ−1
                                ≡       =η                      .                                  (26)
                            sL     wL L             γ     L
This equation states that with endogenous technology, the share of a factor in GDP will
increase in the abundance of that factor as long as σ > 1.
       For completeness, it is also useful to determine the long-run growth rate of this
economy. To do this, note that the Euler equation from the maximization of (3) gives
gc = θ −1 (r − ρ), where gc is the growth rate of consumption and recall that r is the
interest rate. In BGP, this growth rate will also be equal to the growth rate of output, g.
So r = θg + ρ. Next, using (16), the free-entry condition for the technology monopolists
working to invent labor-complementary machines is obtained as η L VL = 1 (naturally,
using the other sector’s free entry condition gives the same result). In steady state, this
condition implies
                                                 1/β
                                    ηL βpL L
                                               = 1.
                                         r
Now using (8), (19), and (24) to substitute for pL , we obtain14
                        ³ £                                  ¤ 1    ´
                 g = θ−1 β (1 − γ) (η Z Z)σ−1 + γ (η L L)σ−1 σ−1 − ρ .

       Finally, it is useful to briefly look at the behavior of the economy outside the balanced
growth path. It is straightforward to verify that outside the balanced growth path, there
will only be one type of innovation.15 If ηVZ /VL > 1, there will only be firms creating
new Z-complementary machines, and if ηVZ /VL < 1, technology monopolists will only
  14
    The no-Ponzi game condition requires that (1 − θ) g < ρ.
  15
    See Proposition 1 in Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) for a formal proof that only one type of inno-
vation will take place outside the balanced growth path and for a proof of global stability in a related
model. The proof here is identical.

                                                  21
undertake R&D for labor-complementary machines. Moreover, VZ /VL is decreasing in
NZ /NL (recall equation (20)). This implies that the transitory dynamics of the system
are locally stable and will return to the balanced growth path. When NZ /NL is higher
than in (24), there will only be labor-augmenting technical change until the system
returns back to balanced growth, and vice versa when NZ /NL is too low.

4.2       The Direction of Technical Change with Knowledge-Based
          R&D
With the lab equipment model of the previous subsection, there is no state-dependence.
I now discuss an alternative specification which allows for potential state-dependence.
In the lab equipment specification there are no scarce factors that enter the accumula-
tion equation of the economy. If there are scarce factors used for R&D, then growth
cannot be maintained by increasing the amount of these factors used for R&D. So for
sustained growth, these factors need to become more and more productive over time,
because of spillovers from past research. This is the essence of the knowledge-based R&D
specification, whereby spillovers ensure that current researchers “stand on the shoulder
of giants”, ensuring that the marginal productivity of research does not decline. Here
for simplicity, I assume that R&D is carried out by scientists, and there is a constant
supply of scientists equal to S.16 If there were only one sector, the knowledge-based
R&D specification would require that Ṅ /N ∝ S (proportional to S).
       With two sectors, instead, there is a variety of specifications with diﬀerent degrees
of state-dependence, because productivity in each sector can depend on the state of
knowledge in both sectors. A flexible formulation is:

                           (1+δ)/2    (1−δ)/2                     (1−δ)/2    (1+δ)/2
                 ṄL = ηL NL         NZ         SL and ṄZ = ηZ NL          NZ         SZ ,      (27)

for some δ ≤ 1. In this specification, δ measures the degree of state-dependence: when
                                        ³         ´ ³            ´
δ = 0, there is no state-dependence– ∂ ṄZ /∂SZ / ∂ ṄL /∂SL = ηZ /η L irrespective
of the levels of NL and NZ –because both NL and NZ creates spillovers for current
  16
     The results generalize to the case where the R&D sector uses labor (or when Z is taken to be
skilled labor, a combination of skilled and unskilled labor), but the analysis of the dynamics becomes
substantially more complicated.


                                                    22
research in both sectors. In this case, the results are very similar to those in the previous
subsection. In contrast, when δ = 1, there is an extreme amount of state-dependence.
              ³          ´ ³          ´
In this case, ∂ ṄZ /∂RZ / ∂ ṄL /∂SL = η Z NZ /η L NL , so an increase in the stock
of labor-complementary machines today makes future labor-complementary innovations
much cheaper, and has no eﬀect on the cost of Z-complementary innovations.
   The condition for technology market clearing in BGP now changes because relative
costs of R&D depend on the current state of technology. In particular, we now have

                                    η L NLδ π L = η Z NZδ π Z ,                         (28)

where δ captures the importance of state-dependence in the technology market clearing
condition. When δ = 0, this condition is identical to (23) from the previous subsec-
tion. Next solving condition (28) together with equations (14) and (19), we obtain the
equilibrium relative technology as

                               = η 1−δσ                               .                 (29)
                            NL                 γ              L
Now the relationship between the relative factor supplies and relative physical produc-
tivities depends on δ. This is intuitive: as long as δ > 0, an increase in NZ reduces the
relative costs of Z-complementary innovations, so for technology market equilibrium to
be restored, π L needs to fall relative to π Z . Substituting (29) into (21) gives
                                         µ         ¶ (1−δ)ε µ ¶ σ−2+δ
                           wZ     σ−1        1−γ      1−δσ
                                                             Z 1−δσ
                              = η 1−δσ                                .                 (30)
                           wL                 γ              L
Relative factor shares are then obtained as
                                             µ         ¶ (1−δ)ε µ ¶ σ−1+δ−δσ
                     sZ   wZ Z     σ−1           1−γ      1−δσ
                                                                 Z    1−δσ
                        ≡      = η 1−δσ                                      .          (31)
                     sL   wL L                    γ              L
It can be verified that when δ = 0, so that there is no state-dependence in R&D, all of
these equations are identical to their counterparts in the previous subsection.
   The growth rate of this economy is determined by the number of scientists. In BGP,
both sectors grow at the same rate, so we need ṄL /NL = ṄZ /NZ , or η Z NZδ−1 SZ =
η L NLδ−1 SL , which gives SL = ηZ S/ (ηZ + η L ), and g = ηL ηZ S/ (ηZ + η L ).

                                                 23
   Recall that with the lab equipment specification, the economy always tends to the
balanced growth path. In contrast, with the knowledge-based R&D specification, the
existence of state-dependence implies that the dynamics of the system can be un-
stable. In particular, there will now only be labor-augmenting technical change if
ηNZδ VZ /NLδ VL < 1, and only Z-augmenting technical change if ηNZδ VZ /NLδ VL > 1. How-
ever, ηNZδ VZ /NLδ VL is not necessarily decreasing in NZ /NL . Inspection of (20) shows that
                                                               ¡             ¢
this depends on whether σ < 1/δ or not. When σ < 1/δ, ∂ NZδ VZ /NLδ VL /∂ (NZ /NL ) <
0 and transitory dynamics will take us back to the BGP. In contrast, when σ > 1/δ,
equilibrium dynamics are unstable and will take us to a corner where only one type of
R&D is undertaken. Intuitively, a greater NZ /NL creates the usual price and market
size eﬀects, but also aﬀects the relative costs of future R&D. If δ is suﬃciently high, this
latter eﬀect becomes more powerful and creates a destabilizing influence. For example,
in the extreme state-dependence case where δ = 1, the system is stable only when σ < 1,
i.e., when the two factors are gross complements.
   In what follows, I restrict my attention to cases where the stability condition is
satisfied, so we have

                        σ < 1/δ      or     δαβ < (1 − δ) (1 − α) .                     (32)

   What is the relationship between relative supplies and factor prices? This depends
on whether
                        σ >2−δ         or    αβ > (1 − δ) (1 − α) .                     (33)

If (33) is satisfied, an increase in the relative abundance of a factor raises its relative
marginal product. When δ = 0, this condition is equivalent to σ > 2, which was obtained
in the previous subsection. It is clear that (32) and (33) cannot be simultaneously
satisfied when δ = 1. In that case, stability of the system requires that the relative
demand curves slope down. However, for all values of δ less than 1, both conditions can
be satisfied simultaneously, so the general conclusions reached in the previous subsection
continue to apply as long as δ < 1. In fact, some degree of state-dependence makes it
more likely that long-run demand curves slope up.
   The case of extreme state-dependence, δ = 1, on the other hand, leads to a number

                                             24
of special results. First, when δ = 1, we need σ < 1–i.e., the two factors to be
gross complements–for stability (recall that we need σ < 1/δ for stability). Intuitively,
extreme state-dependence implies that when the market size eﬀect is more powerful than
the price eﬀect, eventually all innovations will be for one of the sectors. Second, to have
innovations for both sectors, we need equation (31) to be satisfied, which implies:
                                    sZ   wZ Z
                                       ≡      = η −1 .                                  (34)
                                    sL   wL L
Technical change is now acting to equate relative factor shares (and this will be a stable
outcome as long as σ < 1). This formulation of the innovation possibilities frontier
therefore leads to the result that Kennedy (1964) conjectured. Recall that Kennedy
suggested that induced innovations will push the economy towards constant factor shares
(see also Samuelson, 1965, and Drandakis and Phelps, 1965). Here we find that this result
obtains when the innovation possibilities frontier takes the form given in (27) with an
extreme amount of state-dependence, δ = 1. In the next section, I discuss a number of
applications, and I start with the case of limited state-dependence, i.e., δ < 1. I return
to applications of the case with δ = 1 later.

4.3    The Scale Eﬀect and the Market Size Eﬀect
The market size eﬀect, the feature that there will be more R&D directed towards the
more abundant factor, is crucial for the results so far. I derived this eﬀect using a
standard endogenous growth model exhibiting steady long-run growth in the absence of
population growth. As is well known, such models also exhibit a “scale eﬀect”, in the
sense that as population increases, the growth rate of the economy also increases. Jones
(1995) convincingly shows that there is little support for such a scale eﬀect, and instead
proposes a model where steady growth in income per capita is driven by population
growth. One might wonder whether once we remove the scale eﬀect, the market size
eﬀect is still present, especially since both eﬀects are related to the presence of aggregate
increasing returns to scale due to R&D. In this subsection, I show that the market size
eﬀect is independent of the scale eﬀect, so evidence against the scale eﬀect does not
constitute evidence against the market size eﬀect. To show this I analyze a model

                                             25
related to that of Jones (1995) without such scale eﬀects.17
       Suppose that we are in the case with knowledge-based R&D model, but only with
limited spillovers from past research. In particular, suppose that equation (27) is modi-
fied to
                              ṄL = ηL NLλ SL and ṄL = η Z NZλ SZ ,                            (35)

where λ ∈ (0, 1]. In the case where λ = 1, we have the knowledge-based R&D formulation
with no state-dependence.18 When λ < 1, the extent of spillovers from past research
are limited, and this economy will not have steady growth in the absence of population
growth. However, as shown by Jones (1995), there will be steady growth when population
grows steadily. In particular, suppose that population grows at the exponential rate n.
Then it is straightforward to see that output in this economy will grow at the rate
                                                    n
                                              g=       ,
                                                   1−λ
so, there will be steady income per capita growth at the rate λn/ (1 − λ). If λ = 1, there
is no balanced growth, and output would reach infinity in finite time.
       The important point for the focus here concerns the market size eﬀect on the direction
of technical change. To investigate this issue, note that the technology market clearing
condition implied by (35) is
                                      η L NLλ π L = η Z NZλ π Z ,

which is parallel to (28). Exactly the same analysis as there implies that equilibrium
relative technology is
                                           µ            ¶ 1−λσ
                                                            ε  µ ¶ 1−λσ
                                                                    σ−1
                             NZ       σ        1−γ              Z
                                = η 1−λσ                                ,                       (36)
                             NL                 γ               L
and long-run relative factor price is
                                          µ         ¶ (1−λ)ε µ ¶ σ−2+λ
                            wZ      σ−1       1−γ      1−λσ   Z 1−λσ
                               = η 1−λσ                                .                        (37)
                            wL                 γ              L
  17
     Other alternatives include Young (1998) and Howitt (1999). I choose the formulation similar to
that of Jones (1995) for simplicity.
  18
     It is also straightforward to introduce additional state-dependence into this formulation, but I
choose not do so to simplify the discussion.


                                                   26
Therefore, we obtain exactly the same results as before. Specifically, there will always
be technical change biased towards the factor that has become more abundant, and if
σ > 2 − λ, the long-run relative demand curve for factors will be slope up.

4.4       Discussion
The analysis so far has highlighted two important determinants of the direction of tech-
nical change. The first is the degree of substitution between the two factors, which is
derived from the degree of substitution between the two goods that these factors produce.
When the two factors are more substitutable, the market size eﬀect is stronger, and en-
dogenous technical change is more likely to favor the more abundant factor. The second
determinant of the direction of technical change is the the degree of state-dependence
in the innovation possibilities frontier.19
       A natural question to ask at this point is whether existing empirical evidence can
help us determine whether there is substantial state-dependence in the R&D process.
To the best of my knowledge, there has been no direct investigation of this issue. The
data on patent citations analyzed by, among others, Jaﬀe, Trajtenberg and Henderson
(1993), Trajtenberg, Henderson and Jaﬀe (1992) and Caballero and Jaﬀe (1993) may be
useful in this regard. These papers study the extent of subsequent citations of patents.
A citation of a previous patent is interpreted as evidence that a current invention is
exploiting information generated by the previous invention. This corresponds to the
presence of NL and NZ terms in equation (27) in the model here. We can therefore use
  19
    The analysis assumed that all technical change results from purposeful R&D. Plausibly, there may
also be some “technology drift” that is not directed. For example, some new technologies may be
invented as a result of non-profit maximizing incentives. Perhaps more important, big inventions, what
Mokyr (1991) refers to as macro-innovations or what Breshnahan and Trajtenberg (1994) call general-
purpose technologies, may reflect the natural progress of science, and respond little to profit incentives.
The direction of technical change would then determine how these macro-innovations are developed for
commercial use. It is straightforward to generalize the above results to this case. For example, suppose
the innovation possibilities frontier is

                            ṄL = ξ L NL + ηL RL and ṄZ = ξ Z NZ + ηZ RZ ,

where the ξ L and ξ Z terms capture the technology drift, that is, improvements in technology that are
unrelated to R&D eﬀorts directed at diﬀerent types of innovation. The presence of the ξ’s terms does
not change the marginal return to diﬀerent types of innovation. Therefore, for an equilibrium in which
there is both types of R&D, we still need the innovation equilibrium condition, (23), to hold.


                                                    27
patent citations data to investigate whether there is state-dependence at the industry
level. Industry level state-dependence corresponds to patents being cited in the same
industry in which they originated. Unfortunately, it is currently impossible to investigate
state-dependence at the factor level. This is because, although we have information
about the industry for which the patent was developed, we do not know which factor
the innovation was directed at.
    Results reported in Table 1 in Trajtenberg, Henderson and Jaﬀe (1992) suggest that
there is some amount of industry state-dependence, but this is limited. For example,
patents are likely to be cited in the same three-digit industry from which they originated,
but on average, they are more often cited in a diﬀerent three-digit industry. In the future,
it may be possible to develop a classification of diﬀerent innovations into capital, labor
and skill-complementary groups to investigate state-dependence at the factor level. This
seems a fruitful area for future empirical research.


5     Applications (With Limited State-Dependence)
In this section, I discuss some of the applications of directed technical change. I will
emphasize both why models with endogenously biased technical change are useful in
thinking about a range of problems and how the results depend on the elasticity of
substitution. I start with a range of applications where a formulation with limited
state-dependence, i.e., δ < 1, appears to be more appropriate.

5.1    Endogenous Skill-Biased Technical Change
Figure 1 plots a measure of the relative supply of skills (the number of college equivalent
workers divided by noncollege equivalents) and a measure of the return to skills (the
college premium). It shows that over the past 60 years, the U.S. relative supply of skills
has increased rapidly, and in the meantime, the college premium has also increased. The
figure shows that beginning in late 1960s, the relative supply of skills increased much
more rapidly than before. In response, the skill premium fell during the 1970s, and then
increased sharply during the 1980s and the early 1990s.


                                            28
   Existing explanations for these facts emphasize exogenous skill-biased technical change.
Technical change is assumed to naturally favor skilled workers, perhaps because new
tasks are more complex and generate a greater demand for skills. This skill bias ex-
plains the secular behavior of the relative supply and returns to skills. Moreover, the
conventional wisdom is that there has been an acceleration in the skill bias of technology
precisely around the same time as the relative supply of skills started increasing much
more rapidly. This acceleration explains the rapid increase in the skill premium and
wage inequality during the 1980s.
   A model based on directed technical change suggests an alternative explanation.
Suppose that the second factor in the model above, Z, is skilled labor, which I denote
by H. Also assume that the innovation possibilities frontier is given by (27), so that we
are in the knowledge-based R&D model. This is without any loss of generality since for
the focus here, the lab equipment specification corresponds to the case with δ = 0 in
terms of (27). Then, equation (30) from Section 4 implies that the skill premium in the
long run is given by
                                             µ         ¶ (1−δ)ε µ       ¶ σ−2+δ
                               wH      σ−1       1−γ      1−δσ      H      1−δσ
                skill premium=    = η 1−δσ                                        .   (38)
                               wL                 γ                 L
   The framework developed here implies that the increase in the supply of skills creates
a tendency for new technologies to be skill-biased. This oﬀers a possible explanation for
the secular skill-biased technical change of the twentieth century. Equally interesting,
if σ > 2 − δ, then the long-run relationship between the relative supply of skills and
the skill premium is positive: greater skill abundance leads to a greater skill premium.
Intuitively, with σ large enough, the market size eﬀect is so powerful that it not only
dominates the price eﬀect on innovations, but also dominates the usual substitution eﬀect
between skilled and unskilled workers at a given technology (as captured by equation
(21) above). As a result, an increase in the relative supply of skills makes technology
suﬃciently skill-biased to raise the skill premium. In this case, the framework predicts
suﬃciently biased technical change over the past 60 years to actually increase the skill
premium, consistent with a pattern depicted in Figure 1.
   The same model, with σ > 2 − δ, also oﬀers an explanation for the behavior of the

                                           29
college premium during the 1970s and the 1980s shown in Figure 1. Suppose that the
economy is hit by a large increase in H/L. If this increase is not anticipated suﬃciently
in advance, technology will not have adjusted by the time the supply of skills increases.
The initial response of the skill premium will be given by equation (21) which takes
technology as given. Therefore, the skill premium will at first fall, but then as technology
starts adjusting, it will rise rapidly. Figure 3 draws this case diagramatically.
   This framework also provides a possible explanation for why technical change during
the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries may have been biased towards un-
skilled labor. The emergence of the most “skill-replacing” technologies of the past two
hundred years, the factory system, coincided with a large change in relative supplies.
This time, there was a large migration of unskilled workers from villages and Ireland
to English cities and a large increase in population (see, for example, Habakkuk, 1962,
Bairoch, 1988, or Williamson, 1990). This increase created profit opportunities for firms
in introducing technologies that could be used with unskilled workers. In fact, contem-
porary historians considered the incentive to replace skilled artisans by unskilled laborers
as a major objective of technological improvements of the period. Ure, a historian in
the first half of the nineteenth century, describes these incentives as follows:
           “It is, in fact, the constant aim and tendency of every improvement in
      machinery to supersede human labor altogether, or to diminish its costs, by
      substituting the industry of women and children for that of men; of that
      of ordinary labourers, for trained artisans.” (quoted in Habakkuk, 1962, p.
      154).

The framework developed here is consistent with the notion that the incentives for
skill-replacing technologies were shaped by the large increase in the supply of unskilled
workers.
   Therefore, with a suﬃciently large elasticity of substitution, this model provides an
attractive explanation for the skill-replacing technical change of the nineteenth century,
the secular skill bias of technology throughout twentieth century, and the recent accel-
eration in this skill bias and inequality dynamics.
   Is it empirically plausible to think that σ > 2 − δ–or to think that there is a
high degree of substitution? In the case of skilled and unskilled workers, a high degree

                                            30
of substitution seems reasonable. Although the elasticity of substitution is generally
diﬃcult to estimate, there are a number of estimates using aggregate data that give
a range of plausible values. The diﬃculty arises from the fact that the elasticity in
question refers to the elasticity of substitution in the aggregate and holding technology
constant. For this reason, the most reliable estimates appear to be those using time-
series variation, since technology may be thought to respond relatively little to high
frequency variations in relative supply. The great majority of these estimates are above
σ = 1 (see, for example, Freeman, 1986). An interesting study by Angrist (1995) uses
a “natural experiment” arising from the large increase in university enrollments for
Palestinian labor and estimates an elasticity of substitution between workers with 16
years of schooling and those with less than 12 of schooling of approximately σ = 2.
       Whether the elasticity of substitution is large enough to make the long-run relative
demand curve to slope up will also depend on the degree of state-dependence, δ. To start
with, take the case with no state-dependence, δ = 0 (or the lab equipment specification).
This implies that with δ = 0, there will be an upward-sloping long-run relative demand
curve for skills, when σ is greater than 2. This is a relatively large elasticity, but not
outside the plausible range of values. When δ > 0, so that there is some amount of state-
dependence, smaller values of the elasticity of substitution are suﬃcient to generate an
upward sloping long-run demand curve.20
       Finally, to see why I chose to focus of the case of limited state-dependence, recall
from equation (34) that when δ = 1, in the long-run we must have sH /sL = η −1 .
Therefore, the relative shares of skilled and unskilled labor in GDP should be constant
(cfr. equation (34)). This is clearly not consistent with the pattern depicted in Figure
1, where both the number of skilled workers and their relative renumeration have been
increasing over time.
  20
    However, now, we have to check whether the system is stable. For example, if σ = 1.4, (32) implies
that we need δ < 0.71 for stability.

5.2    Directed Technical Change and Cross-Country Income Dif-
       ferences
Many less developed countries (LDCs) use technologies developed in the U.S. and other
OECD economies (the North). A number of economists, including Atkinson and Stiglitz
(1969), David (1975), Stewart (1978), and Basu and Weil (1998), have pointed out that
imported technologies may not be “appropriate” to LDCs’ needs. Directed technical
change increases these concerns: it implies that technologies will be designed to make
optimal use of the conditions and factor supplies in the North. Therefore, they will
be highly inappropriate to the LDCs’ needs (Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 2001). Because
it is still often profitable for the LDCs to use these technologies rather than develop
their own, the extent of directed technical change will determine how inappropriate
technologies in use in the LDCs’ are to their needs. Via this channel, directed technical
change will influence the income gap between the North and the LDCs. I now use the
above framework to discuss this issue.
   Suppose that the model outlined above applies to a country I refer to as “the North”
(either the U.S. or all the OECD countries as a whole). Also to simplify the algebra, I
now focus on the case with no state-dependence δ = 0, though all the results generalize
to the case of limited state-dependence immediately. Suppose also that there are a set
of LDCs in this world economy who will use the technologies developed in the North.
Take Z to be skilled labor, though for the results in this subsection, it could also stand
for physical capital. For simplicity, I take all of these countries to be identical, with L0
unskilled workers and H 0 skilled workers, and normalize the mass of these countries to
1, so that L0 and H 0 are also the total supplies of unskilled and skilled workers in the
LDCs. A key characteristic of the LDCs is that they are less abundant in skilled workers
than the North, so
                                       H0     H
                                            <    .
                                        L0    L
   I assume that because of lack of intellectual property rights, all LDCs can copy new
machine varieties invented in the North without paying royalties to Northern technology
monopolists. This assumption implies that the relevant markets for the technology
monopolists will be given by the factor supplies in the North. I also assume that the

                                            32
cost of producing machines in the LDCs could be higher, κ−β/(1−β) rather than ψ ≡ 1−β
as in the North. This cost diﬀerential may result from the fact that firms in the LDCs
do not have access to the same knowledge base as the technology monopolists in the
North. Suppose also that there is free entry to copying Northern machines, so that all
machines sell at marginal cost in the LDCs (but LDC firms cannot reexport machines
to the North). Finally, for now there is no international trade between the North and
the LDCs.
   An analysis similar to above immediately gives intermediate output in the LDCs
parallel to those in the North (recall equation (18)):
                     1         (1−β)/β                   1         (1−β)/β
            YL0 =       (p0L )         κNL L0 and YH0 =     (p0H )         κNH H 0 ,
                    1−β                                 1−β
where p0 ’s denote prices in the LDCs, which diﬀer from those in the North because factor
proportions are diﬀerent and there is no international trade. The parameter κ features
in these equations since machine costs are diﬀerent in the South. It is natural to think
of κ as less than 1, so that machine prices are higher and fewer machines are used in
the South than in the North. Notice also that the technology terms, NL and NH , are
the same as in the North, since these technologies are copied from the North. Using
this equation and (4) and (18), the ratio of aggregate income in the South to that in the
North can be written as:
                 h ³                   ´α          ³                     ´α i1/α
                       0 (1−β)/β     0                 0 (1−β)/β       0
         Y0    κ γ (pL )         NL L     + (1 − γ) (pH )        NH H
             =      h  ³             ´  α          ³              ´α i1/α        .                (39)
          Y              (1−β)/β                     (1−β)/β

In the Appendix, I show that

Since H 0 /L0 < H/L, this expression implies that when σ > 1, i.e., when the two factors
are gross substitutes, an increase in NH /NL increases the income gap between the LDCs
and the North (i.e. reduces Y 0 /Y ). In contrast, when σ < 1, so that the two factors
are gross complements, an increase in NH /NL narrows the income gap. The intuition

                                                  33
for both results is straightforward. An increase in NH /NL increases the productivity
of skilled workers relative to the productivity of the unskilled. Therefore, everything
else equal, a society with more skilled workers benefits more from this type of technical
change. However, this change also aﬀects the relative scarcity, and therefore the relative
price, of the two goods. In particular, the skill-intensive good becomes more abundant
and its relative price falls. When σ > 1, this eﬀect is weak, and the North still gains
more in proportional terms, and the ratio of LDC income to income in the North falls.
However, when σ < 1, the price eﬀect is strong, and as a result, in proportional terms,
the skill-abundant North benefits less than the LDCs.
   Next, recall that when σ > 1, an increase in NH /NL corresponds to skill-biased
technical change, while when σ < 1, it is a decrease in NH /NL that corresponds to skill-
biased technical change. Therefore, irrespective of the value of σ, skill-biased technical
change increases the income gap between the LDCs and the North. This extends the
results in Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) to a slightly more general model, and also more
importantly, to the case where the two factors are gross complements, i.e., σ < 1.
   This result is important since most economists believe that the past twenty-five years
have witnessed rapid skill-biased technical change (as discussed in subsection 5.1). It
suggests that an unforeseen consequence of this skill-biased technical change is to create
a force widening the income gap between LDCs and rich economies (see Berman, 2000,
for an empirical investigation of this point).
   Now to highlight the role of directed technical change more sharply, contrast two
situations:

  1. New technologies are developed for the Northern market.

  2. New technologies are developed for the world market.

   The first situation applies when there are no intellectual property rights in the LDCs
for Northern companies, and I view it as a good approximation to reality. I compare it
to the second case to highlight how directed technical change will create a force towards
a larger income gap between the LDCs and the North.


                                            34
       When new technologies are developed for the Northern market, equation (24) applies
                         σ−1
and NH /NL ∝ (H/L)    . In contrast, when new technologies can also be sold in the LDC
                          σ

                           ¡          ¢ σ−1
markets, we have NH /NL ∝ H W /LW σ where H W /LW = (H + κH 0 ) / (L + κL0 ) is
the world (eﬀective) ratio of skilled to unskilled workers. The parameter κ features in
this equation because it parameterizes the relative productivity/demand for machines
of LDC workers. By the assumption that H 0 /L0 < H/L, we have H W /LW < H/L.
       Suppose σ > 1, then in the world without intellectual property rights, technologies
developed in the North will feature too high a level of NH /NL for the LDCs’ needs. In
contrast, when σ < 1, then technologies developed in the North will feature too low a
level of NH /NL for the LDCs. However, in the latter case, a lower NH /NL corresponds
to more skill-biased technology, since skilled and unskilled labor are gross complements.
Therefore, in both cases technologies developed in the North will be “too skill-biased”
for the LDCs. So directed technical change creates a force towards a larger income gap
between the rich and the poor. This result is intuitive: there are more skilled workers in
the North, and directed technical change induces technology monopolists in the North
to develop technologies appropriate for skilled workers (i.e., when σ > 1, higher NH /NL ,
and when σ < 1, lower NH /NL ). These skill-biased technologies are less useful for LDCs,
so LDCs benefit less than the North, and the income gap is larger than it would have
been in the absence of directed technical change.

5.3       The Eﬀect of International Trade on Technical Change
The literature on trade and growth shows how patterns of international trade aﬀect
the rate of technical change (e.g., Grossman and Helpman, 1991). Similarly, when the
direction of technical change is endogenous, changes in the amount of international trade
may aﬀect the type of technologies that are developed. This may be relevant for current
economic concerns, for example because, as claimed by Adrian Wood, trade opening
may have aﬀected wage inequality through its eﬀect on “defensive” innovations.21
       To address these issues, consider the same setup as in the previous subsection with a
  21
    This point is also suggested in Acemoglu (1998) and analyzed in detail in Acemoglu (1999a). Xu
(2001) extends the set up of Acemoglu (1999a), which I use here, to have both goods employ both
factors.


                                               35
set of LDCs who can copy innovations from the North, again maintaining the assumption
of no state-dependence (i.e., δ = 0 or the lab equipment specification). Assume that
at first there is no international trade, so the equilibrium characterized in the previous
subsection applies. In particular, the relative price of skill-intensive goods in the North
is given by a similar equation to (19):
                                           µ         ¶ βε µ           ¶− βσ
                                               1−γ     σ      NH H
                                      p=                                      ,                           (41)
                                                γ             NL L
and the skill premium is given by an equation equivalent to (21). When skill bias of
technology is endogenized (with no state-dependence), NH /NL is given by (24).
       Next, suppose that there is full opening to international trade, with both intermediate
goods traded costlessly. Assume that the structure of intellectual property rights is
unchanged as a result of this trade opening.22 International trade will generate a single
world relative price of skill-intensive goods, pW . To determine this price, note that the
                                             ¡ ¢(1−β)/β W
total supply of skill-intensive goods will be pW
                                               H          NH (H + κH 0 ) / (1 − β), and the
                                                ¡ W ¢(1−β)/β W
total supply of labor-intensive goods will be pL            NL (L + κL0 ) / (1 − β). Using
these expressions and equation (7), the world relative price is obtained as
                µ         ¶ βε µ                     ¶− βσ       µ         ¶ βε µ             ¶− βσ
                    1−γ     σ      NHW (H + κH 0 )                   1−γ     σ         NWH
         pW =                                                =                      λ−1 HW            ,   (42)
                     γ             NLW (L + κL0 )                     γ                NL L
where the last equality defines λ ≡ (H/L) / ((H + κH 0 ) / (L + κL0 )) > 1. The fact that
λ > 1 follows because H 0 /L0 < H/L. I also use the notation NHW and NLW to emphasize
that world technologies may change from their pre-trade levels in the North as a result
of international trade.
       Since skills are scarcer in the world economy than in the North alone, trade opening
will increase the relative price of skill-intensive goods in the North, i.e. pW > p. This is a
straightforward application of standard trade theory. What is diﬀerent here is that this
change in product prices will also aﬀect the direction of technical change. In particular,
recall that the two forces shaping the direction of technical change are the market size
eﬀect and the price eﬀect. Because trade does not aﬀect the structure of intellectual
  22
    See Acemoglu (1999a) for a discussion of the results when the enforcement of property rights
changes.

                                                       36
property rights, the market sizes for diﬀerent types of technologies do not change. But
product prices are aﬀected by trade, so the price eﬀect will be operational. Since the
price eﬀect encourages innovations for the scarce factor, international trade, which makes
skills more scarce in the North, will induce more innovations directed at skilled workers.
   To see this more formally, once again consider the case of no state-dependence in
R&D (i.e., the lab equipment specification, or (27) with δ = 0). For the technology
market to clear, we need condition (23) to be satisfied. Combining the relative price of
skill-intensive goods, now given by (42), with technology market clearing condition (23),
we obtain                                 µ         ¶ε µ           ¶σ−1
                            NHW               1−γ              H
                              W
                                = ησ λ                                    .                        (43)
                            NL                 γ               L
Comparing this equation to (24), we see immediately that, because λ > 1, trade increases
the physical productivity of skilled workers more than that of unskilled workers. As
usual, this increase in NH /NL may not correspond to skill-biased technical change if
σ < 1.
   To study the eﬀect of this induced change in technology on factor prices, first note
that (42) implies that without a change in technology trade opening would increase the
skill premium in the North to
                                      µ         ¶ σε           µ        ¶ σ−1 µ        ¶− σ1
                wH ¡ W ¢1/β NH            1−γ              1       NH      σ       H
                   = p         =                       λ   σ                                   .   (44)
                wL          NL             γ                       NL              L

Comparing this equation to (21) from before, we see that trade opening necessarily
increases the skill premium, which is a simple application of standard trade theory.
   When technology responds to trade opening, the skill premium in the North, instead,
changes to                                             µ            ¶ε µ          ¶σ−2
                   wH ¡ W ¢1/β NHW                         1−γ                H
                      = p          = η σ−1 λ                                             .         (45)
                   wL          NLW                          γ                 L
This equation diﬀers from (44) because the skill bias of technology is now given by (43)
rather than being held constant at the pre—trade level.
   Comparing the post-trade skill premium, (45), to the skill premium before trade
opening (e.g. equation (25) or equation (38) from subsection 5.1), we see that irrespective
of whether σ > 1 or not, trade opening increases the skill premium. However, it is

                                              37
more informative to compare the magnitude of the increase in the skill premium with
induced technical change to the increase that would have occurred without technical
change, i.e., compare equation (45) to equation (44). This comparison shows that the
induced technical change will increase the skill premium by more than predicted by the
standard trade theory only when σ > 1. The intuition is simple: expression (43) shows
that trade will induce technical change to increase the relative physical productivity of
skilled workers. An increase in relative physical productivity translates into skill-biased
technical change only when σ > 1. Therefore, we obtain the result that, as conjectured
by Adrian Wood, trade opening could induce skill-biased technical change and increase
wage inequality more than predicted by standard trade theory. Yet, this conclusion
obtains only when skilled and unskilled workers are gross substitutes (which appears to
be the empirically relevant case).

5.4    The Habakkuk Hypothesis
Finally, I use the above framework to discuss the Habakkuk hypothesis. According to
this hypothesis, the more rapid technical change or technology adoption in the U.S.
economy during the ninteenth century relative to the British economy resulted from the
relative labor scarcity in the U.S.. Habakkuk (1962) argued that this labor scarcity en-
couraged firms to develop and adopt labor-saving technologies. Despite the prominence
of this hypothesis in the economic history literature, there has been no widely accepted
formalization of the argument, and we are consequently unaware of under what circum-
stances Habakkuk’s conclusion would apply (see, David, 1975). In addition, standard
economic theory suggests that higher wages may reduce investment, and via this chan-
nel, discourage innovation. Moreover, in contrast to the basic premise of the Habakkuk
hypothesis, the endogenous growth literature emphasizes the presence of a scale eﬀect
which suggests that a larger workforce should encourage more innovation. Could the
Habakkuk hypothesis be valid despite these countervailing eﬀects?
   To discuss this case, suppose that Z now stands for land. Moreover, assume that
η Z = 0, which implies that there are no land-complementary innovations. The only
source of technical change is labor-complementary innovations. The rest of the set-up


                                            38
is the same as before, and to economize on space, I will only study the lab equipment
specification. The question is under what circumstances greater labor scarcity (smaller
L/Z) will lead to a higher level of NL –i.e., to more innovations. From (16), the free-
entry condition for technology monopolists, η L VL = 1, implies23
                                               1/β
                                          η L βpL L
                                                    = 1.
                                                r
Now using (8) and (19), this condition gives:
                             " µ ¶ 1−σ             # σ−1
                                                      1

                                NL σ − (1−σ)2
                          ηLβ Λ        L σ + γLσ−1       = r,                                   (46)
                                Z

where Λ is a suitably defined constant. Inspection of equation (46) immediately shows
that ∂NL /∂Z > 0. Therefore, a greater abundance of land (for a given level of em-
ployment) always encourages the creation of more labor-complementary technologies.
So comparing the U.S. to Britain, as Habakkuk did, leads to the conclusion that there
should be faster technical change in the more land-abundant U.S..
       On the other hand, the sign of ∂NL /∂L–i.e., the eﬀect of labor-scarcity for a given
supply of land–is ambiguous. If σ > 1, so that labor and land are gross substitutes,
it can be verified that ∂NL /∂L > 0, hence in this case, greater scarcity of labor (for a
given supply of land) discourages the development of new technologies. In contrast, if σ
is suﬃciently smaller than 1, i.e., if labor and land are suﬃciently complementary, we
can have ∂NL /∂L < 0.
       This is intuitive. A greater scarcity of labor creates two forces: the price of the labor-
intensive good is higher, but also the market size for labor-complementary technology
is smaller. Which force dominates depends on the strength of the market size eﬀect,
which is again a function of the degree of substitutability. If σ > 1, the market size
eﬀect is powerful and we obtain the opposite of the result conjectured by Habakkuk–it
is not labor scarcity, but labor abundance that spurs innovation. However, with suﬃ-
cient complementarity between labor and land, the model gives the result conjectured by
  23
    Because there is only innovation in one of the sectors, there may no longer be growth in the long
run. In particular, if the two goods are gross complements, i.e., σ < 1, there will not be long-run
growth. The interest rate is always given by r = θg + ρ, which implies r = ρ, when g = 0.

                                                 39
Habakkuk–greater labor scarcity leads to faster innovation. Therefore, in this frame-
work the Habakkuk hypothesis requires labor and land to be highly complementary.
Since the focus of Habakkuk’s analysis was technical change in agriculture and low-tech
manufacturing during the nineteenth century, the assumption of a high degree of comple-
mentarity between labor and other inputs may be realistic. Moreover, the finding that a
low elasticity of substitution between labor and other factors is necessary for Habakkuk’s
hypothesis is intuitive: Habakkuk emphasized high wages as the inducement to technical
change. Labor scarcity translates into higher wages when the elasticity of substitution
is low.


6        Labor-Augmenting Technical Change and State-
         Dependence
6.1       Why Is Long-Run Technical Change Labor-Augmenting?
I have so far discussed a number of applications of directed technical change with limited
state-dependence. Next consider another regularity discussed in the introduction: the
share of labor and capital have been approximately constant in U.S. GDP, while the
capital-labor ratio has been increasing steadily. This suggests that technical change
has been predominantly labor-augmenting (unless the elasticity of substitution between
capital and labor happens to be exactly equal to 1). Can a model of directed technical
change be useful in thinking about why aggregate technical change appears to be labor-
augmenting?
       To provide an answer to this question, suppose that Z corresponds to physical cap-
ital.24 Assume also that Z = K is growing over time due to capital accumulation.
Let us start with the flexible innovation possibilities frontier given by (27), where δ
parameterizates the degree of state-dependence. Then (31) implies that
                                        µ           (1−δ)ε µ
                                                  ¶ (1−δσ)         ¶ σ−1+δ−δσ
                          sK     σ−1        1−γ                K       1−δσ
                             = η 1−δσ                                           .              (47)
                          sL                 γ                 L
  24
    One has to be careful with this interpretation since the model already features “machines” which
can also be thought as capital.



                                                  40
Since there is capital accumulation, i.e., K/L is increasing, equation (47) implies that
unless σ = 1 (the elasticity of substitution exactly equal to 1), or δ = 1 (extreme state-
dependence), factor shares will not be constant: with the capital-labor ratio growing, the
share of capital will be contracting or expanding, and there will exist no balanced growth
path. This implies that neither the lab equipment specification nor the knowledge-based
R&D specification with limited state-dependence are consistent with a constant capital
share or with purely labor-augmenting technical change.
   Therefore, if we want to construct a model where all technical change is (endoge-
nously) labor-augmenting, we need to adopt the innovation possibilities frontier (27)
with δ = 1–i.e., adopt an extreme amount of state-dependence. In Acemoglu (1999b),
I show in more detail that when the innovation possibilities frontier takes the form in
(27) with δ = 1 and the elasticity of substitution is less than 1, there exists a unique
equilibrium path tending to a BGP with only labor-augmenting technical change. This
result can be interpreted as either a positive or negative one: on the positive side,
it shows that it is possible to construct a model where equilibrium long-run technical
change is labor-augmenting, even though capital-augmenting technical change is also
allowed. Moreover, the economy converges to this equilibrium, and on the transition
path, there will typically be capital-augmenting technical change, which implies that
technical change is not always labor-augmenting, but only in the very long run. On the
negative side, it shows that this result only obtains when there is an extreme amount of
state-dependence in R&D, i.e. δ = 1, and when the elasticity of substitution between
labor and capital is less than 1. This leads to two natural questions.
   First, is an elasticity of substitution less than 1 between capital and labor, i.e.,
σ < 1, reasonable? We know even less about the elasticity of substitution between
capital and labor than about the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled
labor. Nevertheless, most estimates suggest that an elasticity less than 1 is reasonable.
As was the case for the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers,
the relevant elasticity is for the aggregate, so the more reliable estimates exploit time-
series variation. Using time-series data, Coen (1969), Eisner and Nadiri (1968), and



                                           41
Lucas (1969), for example, all estimate elasticities significantly less than 1.25
       Second, how do we reconcile this result, which requires extreme state-dependence,
δ = 1, with the findings in the previous subsection, which relied on limited state-
dependence, i.e. δ < 1? One possibility is to accept defeat, and use models of directed
technical change only to discuss issues related to labor, skill and land-complementary
technical change where, as discussed in the previous section, a model with limited state-
dependence leads to realistic predictions. Another possibility is to develop a hybrid
framework where the degree of state-dependence varies across innovations directed at
diﬀerent factors. I give the basic idea here with a simple unified framework.
       Suppose that the final good now takes the form:

                                                 Y = [γYKα + (1 − γ) YLα ]1/α ,

defined as a CES aggregator of a capital and a labor-intensive good. The capital intensive
                                                          RM
good has a production function similar to before: YK = 0 K x1−β            β
                                                                mk (j) djK , where xmk ’s

denote the amounts of capital-complementary machines and MK denotes the varieties
of capital-complementary machines.
       The labor intensive good is produced using both skilled and unskilled labor, and
features three diﬀerent types of technologies:
         µZ       ML                   ¶µ        µZ     NL                    ¶ς                  µZ   NH                        ¶ς ¶β/ς
YL =                   x1−β
                        ml    (j) dj        γL               x1−β
                                                              nl
                                                                          β
                                                                    (j) djL        + (1 − γ L )             x1−β
                                                                                                             nh    (j) djH   β
                                                                                                                                           ,
              0                                     0                                              0

where ML denotes the type of machines that complement both skilled and unskilled
labor, and NL and NH are the range of machines that are used separately by unskilled and
skilled workers respectively. The x’s again denote machine quantities. Therefore, overall
there are 4 diﬀerent types of technical change: capital augmenting, labor-augmenting,
and then separately augmenting skilled and unskilled labor. Now imagine the following
innovation possibilities frontier:

        ṀK              ṀL
            = η MK SMK ,     = ηML SML , ṄH = η NH ML SNH and ṄL = η NL ML SNL ,
        MK               ML
  25
     Berndt (1976) claims that the use of higher quality data leads to higher estimates of the elasticity
of substitution. Nevertheless, Berndt (1976) does not control for a time trend in his estimation, biasing
his results towards one.

                                                                    42
where again S denotes scientists, and the diﬀerent subscripts specify in which sectors
the scientists are working. This specification implies that the technology to generate
capital and labor-augmenting innovations–the M ’s–exhibits extreme state-dependence
with δ = 1. However, the innovation possibilities frontier to produce new technologies
for unskilled labor or skilled labor features limited state-dependence.26 In particular,
new technologies for both skilled and unskilled, NH and NL , build on some general-
purpose “labor-augmenting” body of knowledge, captured by ML (the variety of labor-
augmenting machines).
       This formulation provides a unified framework for analyzing endogenously biased
technical change both between skilled and unskilled labor, and between labor and capital.
The bias of technical change toward skills is determined by the elasticity of substitution
(the strength of the market size eﬀect) and the results obtained in Section 5 continue to
apply. In contrast, the innovation possibilities frontier exhibits extreme path dependence
between capital and labor, so the bias of technical change between labor and capital is
shaped by the requirement that the relative shares of these two factors remain stable
(cfr. equation (34)).
       The problem with this specification is that it does not have micro-foundations. Why
should there be extreme state-dependence in R&D directed at labor vs. capital, but
only limited state-dependence in R&D for skilled vs. unskilled labor? An investigation
of more primitive assumptions that might lead to such a result is a useful area for future
study.

6.2       Wage-Push and Technical Change
Finally, I use the above framework to investigate whether a “wage-push shock” can cause
capital-biased technical change. As discussed in the introduction, Blanchard (1997) doc-
uments that both unemployment and the labor share in a number of continental Euro-
pean economies rose sharply starting in the late 1960s. Both Blanchard and Caballero
and Hammour (1998) interpret this as the response of these economies to a wage-push;
  26
    Here, for simplicity, I take a formulation with no path-dependence for innovations directed at skilled
and unskilled workers, though this can be generalized easily.



                                                   43
the militancy and/or the bargaining power of workers increased because of the changes
in labor market regulations taking place over this time period, or because of the ideolog-
ical eﬀects of 1968. This wage-push translated into higher wages and lower employment.
During the 1980s, we see a diﬀerent pattern: unemployment in these countries continues
to increase, but in most countries, the labor share falls sharply and ends below its start-
ing level. Blanchard conjectures that this may be due to “biased technical change”, while
Caballero and Hammour, similarly, argue that a change in the degree of capital-labor
substitution is responsible for the trends in the 1980s, and that this was a response to the
wage-push of the 1970s. A similar situation occurs in Portugal following the revolution,
with the labor share increasing to over 90 percent of output, but then sharply falling
back to a much lower level. A model of endogenously biased technical change gives us
an opportunity to study these issues.
   Consider the above framework with Z interpreted as capital, K, and as before, focus
on the case with elasticity of substitution less than 1, i.e., σ < 1. In addition, in order
to study wage-push, let me introduce a quasi-labor supply function:

                                        L = m (sL ) ,

where recall that sL is the labor share, and I assume m0 > 0. This function relates
the supply of labor to the labor share rather than to the level of the wage, since, to
be consistent with long-run facts, labor supply must remain roughly constant when the
wage rate increases steadily. Also it is worth noting that this formulation captures both
the labor supply decisions of workers and bargaining between firms and workers. For
example, with a bargaining setup, when unemployment is high (employment is low),
workers will have a weaker bargaining position, and only receive a smaller share of
output, i.e. a lower sL . To simplify the algebra, I further specialize this supply function,
and assume that                  µ        ¶1/τ µ         ¶1/τ
                                     sL               sL
                            L= µ               = µ            .                     (48)
                                   1 − sL            sK
Here τ > 0, and µ is a shift parameter. A decrease in µ will correspond to a “wage-push”
shock, since it will increase the labor share at a given level of employment. A high level
of τ corresponds to a more inelastic quasi-supply curve. This formulation is convenient

                                             44
since an expression for sL /sK , for given bias of technology, can be immediately obtained
from (21) as
                                        µ          ¶− σε µ          ¶ 1−σ
                               sL            1−γ             NK K      σ
                                  =                                         .             (49)
                               sK             γ              NL L
Equation (49) states that when labor and K are gross complements, i.e., σ < 1, as we
have assumed, an increase in the relative productivity of the other factors, NK will raise
the labor share. With σ > 1, we would obtain the opposite results.
   What will happen in the long run? There are two margins of adjustment: the
capital-labor ratio and technology. Even without any adjustment in technology, the
labor share may return back to its initial level if the capital-labor ratio returns to its
initial position. This will be the case, for example, if the long-run return to capital is
given (a perfectly elastic supply of capital or constant relative risk aversion preferences
for the representative consumer). However, Blanchard (1997) shows that changes in
capital-labor ratio do not account for the behavior of the labor share. In fact, in most
countries, the capital-labor ratio rose following the wage-push shock. This raises the
possibility that the major adjustment was due to changes in technology. To focus on
this, I ignore capital accumulation and normalize K = 1 (see Acemoglu, 1999b, for the
analysis of the case where both technology and capital adjust).
   Now combining (48) and (49), we obtain
                                             µ         ¶− τσ+1−σ
                                                             ε   µ        ¶ τ σ+1−σ
                                                                               1−σ

                         SR            σ         1−γ                 NK
                     L        =µ   τ σ+1−σ                                            .   (50)
                                                  γ                  NL

Since σ < 1, (50) defines a positive relationship between µ and L. I use the superscript
“SR” to emphasize that this is the short-run response of employment, for given bias
of technology. (50) implies that a wage-push shock, i.e. a decrease in µ, will reduce
employment. Equation (49) implies that as long as α < 0, this shock will also increase
the labor share in GDP. Therefore, for a given bias in technology, as argued by Blanchard
and Caballero and Hammour, a wage-push will reduce employment and increase the
labor share.
   A wage-push shock will also aﬀect the equilibrium bias of technical change. As
in the previous subsection, consider the case with extreme state-dependence, δ = 1.

                                                    45
The simplest way to proceed is to combine (48) with equation (34) from Section 4.2,
which gives the long-run relative labor share as (sL /sK )LR = η −1 . In other words, the
technology-market clearing condition can only be satisfied if the labor share in GDP
returns back to its initial level. Using this, we also calculate the long-run employment
level as
                                                       1   1
                                          LLR = η− τ µ τ ,                                        (51)

where the superscript “LR” shows that these expressions refer to the long-run equilib-
rium. Next, using equation (29), we obtain the relative technology level consistent with
long-run equilibrium as
                                                    µ          ¶ σε
                                  NK    στ −(1−σ)       1−γ            1
                                     = η τ(1−σ)                       µτ                          (52)
                                  NL                     γ
Comparison of (50) and (51) immediately implies that the elasticity of employment
with respect to µ is greater in the long run (σ/ (τ σ + 1 − σ) < 1/τ .27 This again can be
thought of as an application of the LeChatelier principle. Intuitively, with σ < 1, despite
the increase in the cost of labor resulting from the wage-push, firms cannot substantially
reduce their labor demand in the short run because of the low elasticity of substitution.
However, this change in factor prices increases the value of, and induces, technical change
that would allow firms to be less dependent on labor. Once this technical change takes
place, firms gradually reduce their labor demand.28 Inspection of equation (52) also
implies that a decline in µ–i.e., an adverse labor supply shock–will reduce NK /NL .
This corresponds to capital-biased technical change since capital and labor are gross
complements.29
       Figure 4 draws this case diagramatically, assuming that technology is given in the
short run when the wage-push first occurs, and then traces the adjustment of the econ-
omy to the shock. It shows diagramatically how, as in the case of European economies,
  27
      When σ > 1, equation (51) no longer gives the long-run labor demand, since the economy would
go to an equilibrium with only one type of innovation.
   28
      This idea is related to that proposed by Caballero and Hammour (1998). They suggest that in order
to avoid being appropriated by labor, during the 1980s European firms chose more capital intensive
production techniques, reducing their labor demand.
   29
      However, notice that in this model, the labor share simply returns back to its original level. So
to explain why the labor share may have fallen below its original level in many European countries,
we may also need some of the adverse labor supply shocks to have reversed themselves (i.e., µ to have
fallen back towards its initial level).

                                                  46
the wage-push will first increase the labor share, and then gradually reduce it by creating
capital-biased technical change. Throughout the process, employment falls.


7     Concluding Remarks
For many problems in macroeconomics, development economics, labor economics, and
international trade, whether technical change is biased towards particular factors is of
central importance. This paper synthesized some recent research on the determinants
of biased technical change. The presumption is that the same economic forces–profit
incentives–that aﬀect the amount of technical change will also shape the direction of
technical change, and therefore determine the equilibrium bias of technology. I argued
that this perspective helps us understand a number of otherwise puzzling features. For
example:

    1. Why technical change over the past 60 years may have been skill-biased, and why
      the skill bias may have accelerated over the past twenty-five years. And also
      why new technologies introduced during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
      centuries may have been unskill-biased.

    2. Why biased technical change may increase the income gap between rich and poor
      countries.

    3. Why international trade may induce skill-biased technical change.

    4. Why labor scarcity may spur faster technological progress.

    5. Why technical change may be generally labor-augmenting rather than capital-
      augmenting.

    6. Why a large wage-push, as in continental Europe during the 1970s, may cause
      capital-biased technical change.

    I also highlighted the various modeling choices involved in thinking about the di-
rection of technical change. I demonstrated that there are two robust forces aﬀecting

                                            47
equilibrium bias: the price eﬀect and the market size eﬀect. The elasticity of substi-
tution between diﬀerent factors regulates how powerful these eﬀects are, and this has
implications for how technical change and factor prices respond to changes in relative
supplies.
   Another important determinant of equilibrium bias of technology is the form of
the innovation possibilities frontier–how relative costs of diﬀerent types of innovation
change with the current state of technology. The choice here is between a specification
that emphasizes state-dependence, whereby past innovations complementing a factor
make current innovations directed at that factor cheaper, and a specification without
state-dependence. It appears that in thinking about skill-biased technical change a
specification with only limited state-dependence leads to more plausible results, while in
the case of capital- and labor-augmenting technical change, a specification with extreme
state-dependence appears more appropriate. Although it is possible to combine these
features to have a unified framework that can be applied both to analyzing the degree of
skill bias and capital bias of technology, this framework is currently highly ad hoc and
without micro-foundations. Future work towards such a unified model would be very
useful.
   Whether technical change exhibits this type of state-dependence, and whether this
state-dependence aﬀects diﬀerent factors diﬀerentially, is ultimately an empirical ques-
tion. Existing evidence does not enable us to reach firm conclusions. Nevertheless, data
on patent citations seem to provide a useful starting place, and empirical work that can
inform modeling choices in this field is another area for fruitful future research.

8.2      Sector-Specific and Factor-Specific Technical Change
In the text I discussed a model in which each factor was used only in one sector, hence
there was no sector-specific technical change (diﬀerent from factor-specific technical
change). It is possible to generalize this framework to allow for both types of technical
change.
    Suppose that the final good is defined over two intermediates, denoted 1 and 2:

                                   Y = [γY1α + (1 − γ) Y2α ]1/α .




                                                     49
Although one of the sectors is more intensive in skilled labor and the other sector in
unskilled labor, they both use both factors. In particular, assume that

Here L1 and L2 are the amounts of unskilled labor used in the two sectors (and L1 +L2 =
L), and H1 and H2 are the amounts of skilled labor in the two sectors (with H1 +H2 = H).
M1 and M2 correspond to sector-specific technical change (and x1 and x2 to sector-
specific machines): they benefit all the factors used in the corresponding sector. Finally,
NL and NH correspond to factor-specific technical change, because these machines can
be used with the factors irrespective of which sectors these factors are being employed
in.
      In this more general framework, it is no longer possible to obtain closed-form solu-
tions. Nevertheless, a similar analysis to before reveals a number of important results.
Denote the prices of the two sectors by p1 and p2 , and consider the profit maximization
of firms in the two sectors, i.e. to maximize p1 Y1 and p2 Y2 , taking factor, product and
machine prices as given. Diﬀerentiation gives relatively simple expressions for machine
demands. In particular, total expenditure on sector-specific machines is given by
                                                  p1 Y1                             p2 Y2
                    χ1 (j) x1 (j) = (1 − β)             and χ2 (j) x2 (j) = (1 − β)       ,                           (53)
                                                   M1                                M2
where χ1 (j) and χ2 (j) again denote machine prices. Some algebra also gives that
                                       1 − β wL L1                      1 − β wL L2
                    χl (j) x1l (j) =               and χl (j) x2l (j) =             ,
                                         β    NL                          β    NL
where again χl (j) is the price of unskilled labor-complementary machine j. Similar ex-
pressions apply for the demand for skilled labor-complementary machines. Summing
these two expressions, we have total expenditure on unskilled labor-complementary ma-
chines as
                                                               1 − β wL L
                                        χl (j) xl (j) =                   ,                                           (54)
                                                                 β NL

                                                          50
and similarly for skilled labor-complementary machines
                                                 1 − β wH H
                               χh (j) xl (j) =              .                         (55)
                                                   β    NH
   Although it is cumbersome to characterize the full equilibrium of this model, these
expressions give some useful intuition. First recall that profits will be proportional to
total expenditures (since prices are given by a constant markup over marginal cost).
The expressions in (53) then show that it will be more profitable to develop technolo-
gies for sectors that generate greater revenues. This result confirms the conjecture by
Schmookler (1966) that sectors facing greater demand will generate more innovation.
   Comparison of expressions (54) and (55) with (17) in Section 3 shows that the incen-
tives to carry out factor-biased technical change are the same in this more general model
as in the simpler framework where each factor was only used in one sector. This high-
lights that the key dimension of the results above was factor-specific technical change not
sector-specific technical change. The incentives to develop factor-complementary tech-
nologies is identical in this more general framework to those in the simpler framework
of Section 3.
