Introduction

There is much debate on whether the standard labor market search model can replicate
the cyclical properties of the labor market. In an influential paper Shimer (2005a)
has argued that the textbook search model described in Pissarides (2000) can not
replicate the high degree of volatility of key labor market variables observed in US
data. In contrast, Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) reach the opposite conclusion in
a specification of the model where unemployment has little cost. Shimer (2004), Hall
(2005), Hall and Milgrom (2008), and Gertler and Trigari (2009) have noticed that
modeling wage rigidities can also help to account for the cyclical volatility of vacancies
and unemployment. Caballero and Hammour (1994, 1996, 1998) and more recently
Pissarides (2009) and Silva and Toledo (2011) have instead emphasized the importance
of allowing for some hiring costs, unrelated to aggregate labor market conditions. These
costs make the ex ante net value of creating a job small, which amplifies the sensitivity
of job creation to aggregate shocks for the same reasons as in Hagedorn and Manovskii
(2008). Eyigungor (2010) exploits a similar mechanism.
The debate in this literature has for the most part focused on textbook versions
of the search model, usually driven by just neutral technology shocks. In addition,
quantitative analysis has by and large relied on calibration, assessing the predictions
of the model using a few moments typically measured only in US data. This paper
departs from this strand of work in three important dimensions. First, we endow the
search and matching model with a rich set of shocks and transmission mechanisms,
including those above mentioned (low cost of unemployment, wage rigidity and hiring
costs) which may considerably amplify and propagate the effects of shocks. Second, we
estimate the model using full information methods and seven observable series from
the labor market and national accounts. Third, we study the empirical performance of
the model in several European countries as well as in the US.
The focus of our analysis is on the extent to which technology shocks—as usually
modeled in the real business cycle literature—can explain the cyclical properties of the
labor market not only in the US but also in different European countries. In tackling
this issue, we highlight some important differences in the cyclical behavior of unemployment, vacancies and workers flows between the US and Europe and across European
countries. These differences allow us to quantify the importance of disturbances other
than technology shocks for the cyclical dynamics of labor markets across countries.
The model that we take to the data is a conventional real business cycle search
model, extended to incorporate many ingredients regarded as important by the business

1

cycle literature to enhance the model’s empirical performance. We allow for non linear
preferences, endogenous capital utilization and for adjustment costs to capital and to
job creation. Job separation probabilities are endogenous and privatively efficient—i.e.
they are set to maximize the private net surplus of jobs. Recruiting efforts require as
inputs both final output and labor. Job creation involves incurring the traditional costs
of posting vacancies as well as other hiring costs unrelated to aggregate labor market
conditions. To model the importance of wage rigidity, the wage setting mechanism is
such that in a fraction of jobs wages are rigid as in Hall (2005), while in the remaining
fraction wages are set through Nash bargaining as in the conventional formulation
of the search model described in Pissarides (2000). This formulation nest full wage
rigidity and only Nash bargaining as special cases.
The model is driven by six possible shocks that different strands of the business cycle
and labor matching literature have regarded as important for the analysis of cyclical
fluctuations. Allowing for several shocks is important to match key features of the data
and to estimate the model with full information methods. These disturbances consist
of neutral technology shocks, as in the conventional real business model by Kydland
and Prescott (1982) and Prescott (1986) and Shimer (2005); shocks to investmentspecific technology following Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (2000), Fisher (2006),
Michelacci and Lopez-Salido (2007) and Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2010);
stochastic variations in the discount factor of households as in Primiceri, Schaumburg,
and Tambalotti (2006); shocks to the search and matching technology as in Blanchard
and Diamond (1989, 1990), Hosios (1994) and Cheremukhin and Echavarria (2009); job
destruction shocks that lead to movements in job separation probabilities unrelated to
the net private surplus of jobs as in Shimer (2005a); and, finally, shocks to aggregate
demand which cause exogenous changes in households’ wealth.
The model is taken to the data using a cross-country comparable data set for
unemployment, vacancies, unemployment flows, output, consumption and investment.
Worker flows data are taken from Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2010). Our data set
includes two Anglo-Saxon countries (the US and the UK), two Continental European
countries (France, and Germany) and two Nordic countries (Norway and Sweden) over
the period 1982-2007 although sample dates vary by country.
Our countries differ in terms of the average unemployment rate and in the rate
at which workers lose their job when employed or find new jobs when unemployed.
The cyclical properties of the labor market are also different across countries in terms
of volatility and co-movement, in unemployment, vacancies and workers flows. While
there is a large literature contrasting the properties of real business cycles across coun-

2

tries, (see for instance Ambler, Cardia, and Zimmermann 2004, and references therein)
similar cross-country comparisons for the labor market are scant in quantitative work
with search and matching models.
We separately estimate the model for each country, allowing parameters to vary
along several dimensions including levels of unemployment rate, worker flows, search
costs, workers’ bargaining power, unemployment benefits, wage rigidity as well as in
the properties of shocks driving cyclical fluctuations. We adopt a Bayesian approach
to inference, using mixed frequency data (quarterly and annual). To this end we rely
on methods for state space models with temporarily aggregated observables, following
Harvey (1990). Using mixed frequency data is important for our analysis since it
enables us to cast the model at a quarterly horizon—given that in some countries
worker transitions occur at a high frequency—while in our sample workers flow data
are available just at an annual frequency. In addition to allowing for longer time series,
estimation in mixed frequency accommodates missing observations, so as to deal with
an unbalanced panel of aggregate time series, within each country.
Our main findings can be summarized as follows:
1. Labor markets and national accounts data. When focusing on labor market variables, there are substantial cross-country differences in the importance of shocks
for cyclical variations and in the elasticities to shocks, as evident from variance
decompositions and impulse response functions. Cross-country discrepancies are
considerably smaller for national accounts variables.
2. Technology shocks. Technology shocks are the key driving force of national accounts
data in all countries, while their contribution to labor market fluctuations vary substantially across countries. These disturbances account for the bulk of the cyclical
fluctuations in unemployment, vacancies and job finding probability observed in the
US data. They are also an important driving force of the cyclical dynamics of the
labor market in some European countries, such as Germany and particulary Sweden. In France, Norway and the UK the contribution of technology shocks to the
business cycle in the labor market is instead substantially more muted.
3. Matching and job destruction shocks. In Europe matching and job destruction
shocks explain a larger share of the business cycle in unemployment, compared
to the US, especially in France and the UK. The contribution of matching shocks to
the cyclical variance in the finding probability is also considerably larger in Europe.
These two observations reflect some salient features of the data that are hard to
replicate with technology shocks only. First, the Beveridge curve is generally less
3

stable in European countries than in the US, resulting in lower associations between
unemployment and vacancies. Second, the correlation between the job separation
rate and the unemployment rate is substantially larger in Europe than in the US.
Third, the correlation bettween the job finding rate and vacancies is substantially
smaller in Europe than in the US.
4. Differences in parameter estimates. The estimated size of hiring costs unrelated to
labor market conditions is generally small, albeit comparatively larger in the US
and in Germany than in any other country. Job separation probabilities in France,
Germany, and the UK respond more to labor market conditions compared to the US.
This suggests that in these countries the separation margin is particularly important
to characterize the transmission mechanism of shocks.

Our analysis constitutes a first step in understanding cross-country differences in the
cyclical fluctuations of the of labor market through the lens of a search model. Space
constrains generated by the scope of the paper prevent us from analyzing a number
of interesting questions raised by our results. For instance, we do not dissect the
key transmission mechanism(s) that allows technology shocks to generate considerable
volatility in aggregate labor market variables across different countries. Our empirical
analysis also abstracts from direct measures of wages to identify important structural
parameters of the model. This is an important omission, given that one of the main
lessons by Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) is that these data are important to identify
crucial properties of the transmission mechanism in search models.1 Nonetheless, we
have reasons to believe that at least some of our main conclusions should be robust
to further scrutiny. The correlation structure of unemployment, vacancies and workers
flows probabilities is significantly different in the US and in some European countries.
It is these differences that make unlikely that neutral technology shocks (at least as
usually modeled) can account for the lion’s share of the cyclical fluctuations of the
labor market in all European countries.
As it is standard in the search and matching literature, our analysis focuses on a real
model, where disturbances to aggregate demand cannot be the main drivers of cyclical
fluctuations in output and employment. This might imply that some shocks here identified as driven by a change in technology would in other frameworks be interpreted as
disturbances to aggregate demand. For example, in alternative New Keynesian DSGE
models, where the presence of nominal rigidities makes output demand determined,
1

For the case of the US, we pursue the identification of alternative transmission mechanisms using
the labor share as observable in Justiniano, Lopez-Salido, and Michelacci (2010).

4

the literature has found evidence that demand shocks matter and that (neutral and
investment specific) technology shocks play a more limited role in generating business
cycles (Galı́ and Rabanal 2004, Justiniano et al. 2010). Discerning the role of aggregate demand versus technology shocks in cyclical fluctuations has important normative
implications in the design of the appropriate monetary and fiscal policy responses to
shocks and it is clearly an important area for future research.
Regarding the structure of the paper, Section 2 characterizes differences in labor
market dynamics across the OECD. Section 3 characterizes the economy while Section
4 presents the equilibrium conditions of the decentralized economy. Section 6 discusses
our choice for priors. Section 7 reports on estimation results.

Data description

We first briefly mention the sources for our data-set and then highlight important
differences in the cross-country properties of selected variables in terms of means,
volatilities, and cross-correlations. It is these differences that we interpret through
the lens of the estimated structural model later on. Therefore, in sections 6 and 7 we
extensively refer back to properties of the data highlighted here.
2.1

Data sources

The countries included in the analysis are the US, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway,
and the UK. We look at national accounts data(GDP, consumption and investment),
as well as of labor market variables (unemployment, vacancies, finding and separation
probabilities). Time series for national income accounts, unemployment and vacancies
are available at quarterly frequency. Worker flow probabilities are only available at an
annual frequency.
To increase data comparability, we rely as much as possible on data compiled by
the OECD. Data for GDP, consumption, and investment are taken from the OECD
national income accounts except for Norway. Consumption corresponds to real personal final consumption expenditures, investment to total investment expenditures in
private fixed investment. National accounts data for Norway are obtained from Statistics Norway and for Mainland only, hence excluding the part of Norwegian economic
activity directly related to oil extraction and exploration in the North Sea. For Sweden,
only GDP is taken from Statistics Sweden, due to longer time coverage, since in the
OECD database, this series starts in 1993. In all countries, GDP, consumption, and
investment are expressed in per-capita terms, i.e. divided by population.

5

Data on vacancies, unemployment, and employment are obtained from the OECD
Main Economic Indicator online database. The unemployment rate is simply total
number of unemployed over total labor force, which is measured by the sum of employed and unemployed workers. Data on job vacancies (in thousands) are used to
construct the vacancy rate as the ratio of job vacancies to the sum of job vacancies
and employment, consistent with the definition of the job opening rate used in JOLTS
for the US.2
Worker flows data are taken from Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2010). Consistent with
earlier comments an important feature of the Elsby et al. (2010) worker flow measures
is that original data sources also come from the OECD, making them comparable across
countries. These authors use annual measures of the unemployment stock by duration
and quarterly measures of the unemployment rate to infer the (yearly) average continuous time Poisson exit rate from unemployment and entry rate into unemployment
from employment. Their methodology is intended to correct for the time aggregation
bias emphasized in Shimer (2005b). The implied worker flows rates are available at an
annual frequency only, and they correspond to the average monthly Poisson rates in
each year. We convert these Poisson rates into quarterly probabilities by calculating
the quarterly job finding and job separation probability that generate an expected duration of an unemployment spell and an expected duration of an ongoing job consistent
with the continuous time Poisson arrival rate calculated by Elsby et al. (2010). In the
conversion we assume that a worker who loses a job in a quarter, can find a new one
in the same quarter which is consistent with the timing convention of the structural
model introduced in Section 3.3
2.2

Descriptive statistics

The sample periods are 1982:I-2007:IV for the United States (USA), 1989:I-2007:IV
for France (FRA), 1991:I-2007:IV for Germany (DEU), 1980:I-2004:IV for the United
Kingdom (GBR), 1983:I-2007:IV for Norway (NOR), and 1983:I-2004:IV for Sweden
(SWE). Sample dates are largely determined by the Elsby et al. (2010) coverage of
2

For the US we splice, in 2001, the log detrended help wanted index with the log JOLTS job
opening rate.
3
Let fτm and sm
τ denote the average Elsby et al. (2010) monthly Poisson arrival rate in year τ for job
finding and job separation, respectively. The implied expected duration of a job in quarters is 1/(3sm
τ )
while the analogous expected duration of an unemployment spell (again in quarters) is 1/(3fτm ). We
define the yearly average of the quarterly job separation probability as equal to Λτ = 3sm
τ , which is
consistent with the model assumption in Section 3 that a new job lasts at least one quarter. The
analogous job finding probability is set equal to fτ = 1/ [1/(3fτm ) + 1], which is again consistent with
the model assumption that workers, who lose their job in a period, can find another one in the same
period. So the minimum duration of an unemployment spell is zero.

worker flows, although additional considerations constrain us further in a few countries.
For instance, the starting date for Germany is due to German reunification, while the
availability of data on vacancies determines the start of the sample in France, as well
as the end date in the United Kingdom.
Data are expressed in logs, multiplied by 100 and detrended using the HodrickPrescott filter with smoothing parameter equal to 1600 for observables available at a
quarterly frequency and equal to 100 for observables at the annual frequency. Due to
the mixed frequency of the data, in statistics reported below involving finding and separation probabilities the time unit is one year, while it is one quarter for all remaining
series.
To begin highlighting the diversity in labor markets across the countries in our
sample, Panel A) in Table 1 reports sample means for the unemployment rate u, and
the job finding and job separation probabilities, denoted by f and Λ, respectively.
As expected the unemployment rate in France, Germany and the UK is higher than
in the US. In contrast, the unemployment rate of the two Scandinavian countries is
below that in the US. Finding and separation probabilities in France, Germany, and
the UK are significantly lower than in the US, while Nordic countries lie in between the
levels in the US and these other European countries. The level of the Unemployment
Insurance replacement rate measured by the percentage of net earning in work over
five years of unemployment, comes from the OECD database on Benefits and Wages.
As it is well known, benefit levels are substantially lower in the US than in any of
these other countries. Panel A also reports a cursory look at the value of the matching
elasticity to unemployment implied by a simple OLS regression of the log job finding
probability f on the logged vacancy-unemployment ratio v/u. The inferred elasticity
of the matching function to unemployment is in the range 0.7-0.8. At least with this
simple regression, this is slightly higher than the conventional estimates discussed in
Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) but not too far away from the range of values of
0.7-0.75 obtained by Shimer (2005a) using a similar methodology on US data.
The standard deviation of our variables, using each country’s specific sample are
reported in Panel B. The analogous value relative to the same statistic in the US when
restricting the analysis to a common sample is shown in Panel C. To save space we
just omit the relative volatilities for consumption and investment. The overall picture
emerging from these comparisons is that while GDP, consumption and investment are
in general more volatile in Europe than in the US, differences in volatilities are larger
for labor market variables, both across the Atlantic and within Europe. Observe for
instance that France, Germany and the UK have lower standard deviations in unem-

Notes: Notes: The UI-replacement rate is the percentage of net earnings in work received as unemployment benefits as reported from the OECD. The matching elasticity to unemployment is obtained
from an OLS regression of the log job finding probability f on the logged vacancy-unemployment
ratio v/u. Standard deviations and correlations are calculated for the variable in logs. For finding
and separation probabilities the serial correlation is at the annual level.

ployment and vacancies than the US, although the reverse is true for GDP, consumption
and investment. Scandinavian countries have instead larger standard deviations in unemployment and vacancies than the US, although this higher volatility is in line with
the larger standard deviations observed for GDP, consumption, and investment. A
salient feature of the data is that finding and separation rates are considerably more
volatile in all five European countries relative to the US. This last observation may be
puzzling. However, we have found similar results when using alternative measures for
unemployment flows available for France and the UK constructed by Petrongolo and
Pissarides (2008), once these are aggregated and detrended at an annual frequency.
Panel D) of Table 1 reports the first order autocorrelation of variables—recall differences in time units across series. In general, there are no major differences across
countries in the serial correlation of unemployment and vacancies. In contrast, finding
probabilities are more persistent in the US than in the UK, and, in particular, France
and Germany. But generally cross-country differences in persistence are small. Overall, separation rates exhibit little serial correlation in the US and Europe, with the
exception of Sweden where they are more persistent than finding rates. Finally, the
serial correlation of GDP in Norway is remarkably smaller than in any other country,
likely due to oil production, which indirectly affects the value of mainland GDP.
Figure 1 plots the Beveridge curve for the six OECD countries in our sample.
The vacancy rate and the unemployment rate are both in logs, and the scale of axes is
maintained unchanged for the different countries. The figure highlights some important
cross-country differences in the cyclical properties of the labor market. In the US,
Norway and to a lesser extent Sweden vacancies and unemployment line up along a
well behaved negatively sloped relation. In contrast, the Beveridge curve would not
seem fairly stable in France, Germany and the UK.
Table 2 reports contemporaneous correlations focusing on labor market variables
listed by row. The correlation between unemployment and vacancies is substantially
higher in the US than in Germany, UK, and in particular France, where it is close to
zero. In contrast, the same statistic is quite similar across the Scandinavian countries
in our sample and the US. These two observations are in line with the evidence in
Figure 1. The degree of comovement between unemployment and the finding rate is
highest in the US, with the converse being true for separations. This suggests that
the separation margin may be relatively more important in explaining unemployment
dynamics in Europe than in the US, consistent with the conclusions by Elsby et al.
(2010). Finding and separation probabilities are negatively correlated in al countries
except Norway where the correlation is positive and in the UK, where it is close to

zero. The positive association of the separation rate with the finding rate in Norway is
noteworthy, although visual inspection of the series suggests that might have partially
to do with a couple of outliers.
To summarize, the properties of labor market data differ, at times considerably,
both between the US and Europe, as well as within European countries. Broadly
speaking, differences with the US seem more marked with Germany, UK and particularly France, rather than with Norway and Sweden. Nonetheless, the last two countries
stand out in the relatively high volatility of the separation rate. As discussed in Section
7, these empirical regularities play a crucial role in understanding the identification of
shocks as well as cross-country differences in the importance of different disturbances
for fluctuations within our estimated structural model, to which we now turn.

Description of the decentralized equilibrium

We describe the assumptions that characterize the decentralized equilibrium.
Job output and technologies There is one consumption good, the numeraire,
which is produced according to
Y = Ft (jK, N ) = At (jK)α N 1−α ,

(1)

with 0 < α < 1. Here j denotes capital utilization, K the capital stock, N the amount
of labor intensive intermediate goods used in production, while At is the standard
source of temporary cyclical fluctuations considered in general equilibrium versions of
the standard search model, see Andolfatto (1996), Merz (1995), and Den-Haan, Ramey,
and Watson (2000). We assume that
at ≡ ln At = ρa at−1 + εat .

(2)

Labor intensive intermediate goods are produced in jobs which consist of firm-worker
pairs. A worker can be employed in at most one job. A job produces a unit of
intermediate goods.
Capital Accumulation Households accumulate capital and rent it out to firms.
Following Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), we allow for the presence of investment adjustment cost. Adjustment costs to capital are important to reproduce the
high serial correlation of investment in the data. As a result, the law of accumulation

12

of the capital in the hand of the representative household (see below) can be described
as follows:
Kt+1




It
= [1 − δ (jt )] Kt + e 1 − T
It ,
It−1
ϕt

(3)

where δ (jt ) is the depreciation rate while the function T satisfies T = T 0 = 0 in
deterministic steady state and T 00 > 0. Out of the deterministic steady state, T, T 0
and T 00 are all strictly positive.4 These assumptions imply that at the steady state the
relative price of installed capital in terms of new capital goods equals unity. In the
above expression It is the amount of investment expenditures measured in final output.
The variable ϕt represents the investment specific technology, as in Solow (1960) and
Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997). It evolves according to the following AR(1)
process:
ϕt = ρϕ ϕt−1 + εϕt .

(4)

At a more general level, these shocks characterize the effects of arbitrary shocks to
the demand for capital. Following this logic, Shimer (2010) interprets a shock to ϕ as
characterizing the effects of a change in financial frictions on the demand for capital.
As in Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (2000) and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2008, 2010), owners of physical capital can control the intensity with which the capital
stock is utilized. Formally, we let jt measure capacity utilization in period t. The
effective amount of capital services that households supply to firms in period t is given
by jt Kt . We assume that increasing the intensity of capital utilization j implies a faster
rate of capital depreciation δ (j) so that
δ (j) = δ0 + δ1 (j − 1) +

δ2
(j − 1)2
2

(5)

To guarantee that the depreciation rate is an increasing and convex function of the rate
of capacity utilization we assume that δ0 , δ1 , δ2 are non negative. We normalize capital
utilization to one in steady state. This modeling of capital utilization guarantees the
existence of a steady state equilibrium even in the presence of a trend in the investmentspecific technology.
Search frictions The labor market for workers is subject to search frictions.
The matching process within a period takes place before production in the period.
4

In practice in the second order expansion below we assume that the function T takes the form
T (x) =

T 00
(x − 1)2 ,
2

where T 00 > 0.

13

So workers and firms that are matched in period t begin active relationships in the
same period. Unmatched workers remain jobless. Workers and firms whose matches
are severed can enter their respective matching pools and be re-matched within the
same period. We modify standard timing conventions in the discrete time version
of the search model (see for example Shimer, 2010) to guarantee that unemployment
duration spells can be arbitrarily close to zero. This is important to match the empirical
evidence of some countries such the US where unemployment duration is remarkably
small.5 Following Pissarides (2000), we model the flow of viable matches using a
matching function
nt (s, v) = (Mt s)η v 1−η ,

(6)

whose arguments s and v denote the masses of workers searching for a new job and of
vacancies, respectively. This function is homogeneous of degree one, increasing in each
of its arguments, concave, and continuously differentiable.6 Under (6), the probability
that a vacancy gets filled is given by:
η

nt (s, v)  n − 1−η
=
q (f ) =
=f
v
s

η
− 1−η

,

which is decreasing in the rate at which an unemployed worker finds a job given by
f ≡ n/s. We assume that
mt ≡ ln Mt = (1 − ρm )m + ρm mt−1 + εmt ,

(7)

which characterizes a shock to the matching technology, i.e. a skill mismatch shock.
These shocks do not affect the productivity of a job, but have a direct effect on the
outside options of workers. These shocks tend to induce a positive co-movement in the
job finding and job separation rate and shift the Beveridge curve.7
Job creation Free entry by firms determines the size of the vacancy pools. Processing the applications for a vacancy requires some recruiting services that are exchanged in a perfectly competitive market. The amount of recruiting services required
for training n workers and processing applications for v vacancies is given by:
R̄(n, v) = γn n + γv v, γn , γv ≥ 0,
5

(8)

For example, with this formulation the expected duration of unemployment in steady state is
equal to f1 − 1, where 0 < f < 1 denotes the job finding probability.
6
We will check that, over the relevant range, it always satisfies nt (s, v) ≤ min(s, v).
7
Shocks with this property are usually dubbed reallocative, see Blanchard and Diamond (1989,
1990), Davis and Haltinwanger (1999) and Balakrishnan and Michelacci (2001) for evidence about
the relevance of these shocks. Cheremukhin and Echavarria (2009) also argue that these shocks are
important to explain the cyclical volatility of labor market variables and of the labor wedge in the
US.

14

η

1

Notice that after using (6) to substitute for v = (Mt s)− 1−η n 1−η , the amount of recruiting services can be written as
"



Rt (s, n) = γn + γv

n
Mt s

η #
 1−η

n,

(9)

which is an extended formulation of the conventional search model. The parameter
γn matters for the costs of search inefficiencies. This is because training costs are
paid before wage bargaining takes place, which leads to a natural hold-up problems.
As emphasized by Pissarides (2009) this inefficiency matters little for results. In the
standard formulation of the search model (see for example Pissarides, 2000) creation
costs are linear in vacancies which corresponds to the case γn = 0 . Pissarides (2009)
emphasizes the importance of job creation costs unrelated to aggregate labor market
conditions, γn > 0 , for reproducing the volatility of key cyclical variables in the US,
see also Rotemberg (2006) and Silva and Toledo (2011). The term in

n
Mt s

in (9) are

due to search frictions in the labor market and they imply that job creation costs fall
when more workers are searching for a job. This represents the search component of
the total costs of job creation.
Recruiting services are produced by combining labour intensive intermediate goods
and some final output services whose unitary cost is normalized to one. We also allow
for the presence of adjustment costs in the supply of recruiting services. The supply
of recruiting services at time t is denoted by Rt and is equal to:



St
Rt = St 1 − G
,
St−1

(10)

where St is the input in the production of recruiting services. These input services are
obtained by using X units of labour intensive intermediate goods and O units of output
services according to the following Cobb-Douglas production function:
 κ 
1−κ
X
O
S=
κ
1−κ
The function G characterizes adjustment costs in the production of recruiting services.
It satisfies the condition G = G0 = 0 in deterministic steady state and G00 > 0.
Out of the deterministic steady state, G, G0 and G00 are all strictly positive.8 These
8

In practice in the second order expansion below we assume that the function G takes the form
G(x) =

G00
(x − 1)2 ,
2

where G00 > 0.

15

assumptions imply that in steady state, adjustment costs are irrelevant and the relative
price of S and R are equal. Adjustment costs in the supply of recruiting services
slow down the adjustment of vacancies. This helps in reproducing the strong serial
correlation of vacancies observed in the data and the fact that the response of vacancies
to shocks is typically hump-shaped (vacancies are sluggish to respond). Fujita and
Ramey (2007) and Ravn and Simonelli (2008) have emphasized that the conventional
search model has problems in reproducing this feature of the data.
Cost minimization implies that the unitary cost of producing an input service S is
rt = pκt ,

(11)

where 0 < κ < 1, and pt denotes the equilibrium price of a labor intensive intermediate
good. This is achieved by using
 1−κ
1
xt = κ
pt

(12)

units of labour intensive intermediate goods and by spending
ot = (1 − κ) rt

(13)

units of final output. The expression for the cost of recruiting services in (11) allows for
differences in the factor content of recruiting costs which Shimer (2010) has shown to
matter for the response of the economy to shocks. When recruiting services are obtained
by just using labor—which in our formulation corresponds to the case κ = 1—Shimer
(2010) derives a neutrality proposition whereby shocks to labor productivity have no
effects on unemployment.9 Absence of adjustment costs requires setting G00 = 0.
Job destruction The worker in the job needs to invest to maintain the job
productive. Greater effort in maintenance involves a greater survival probability of the
job. But greater investment in maintenance also comes at cost to the worker because
it reduces the amount of leisure he enjoys. We assume that, when the job destruction
λt

probability is Λt , the worker enjoys utility from leisure equal to e− µ O(Λt ) which is
increasing and concave in Λt , O0 > 0, O00 < 0. We also assume that in steady state
O = 0, which is just a normalization. The stochastic disturbance λt evolves as
λt = ρλ λt−1 + ελt .
9

(14)

In addition to κ = 1, the analysis in Shimer (2010) regarding the neutrality proposition would
require that capital is absent α = 0 and that γn = 0 so that R̄(n, v) = γv v.

16

so it has mean zero in steady state. The shock ελt will induce a specific shock to the
job separation rate. Greater λt reduces the value of leisure enjoyed by the worker and
thereby reduces the job separation probability. This modeling of the job separation rate
is convenient because it allows to solve the model using linear methods, still preserving
key properties of models with endogenous job separation. In particular the equilibrium
job separation rate will fall when the job net surplus increases, which is the key insight
of any model where job separation is set optimally to maximize the job net surplus, see
Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Moreover, shocks to the endogenously determined
separation rate will have nil first order effects on the expected net value of a newly
created job, due to a conventional envelope condition. As emphasized by Pissarides
(2009), this is another important property of models with endogenous separation.
We assume that job destruction decisions are privately efficient and are always set
so as to maximize the private net surplus of a job. This is coherent with Barro (1977)
who argue that two parties in direct contact with one another can always arrange the
terms of their relationship so to achieve private bilateral efficiency. This is the natural
equilibrium outcome if investment in job maintenance is observable and verifiable and
we assume that firms and workers sign long-term contracts that specify fully contingents
plans for workers’investment in job maintenance. The same outcome would also be
obtained in equilibrium if we were to follow Hall (2009) in assuming that the worker
at the start of the relationship buys out the firm by paying to the firm the full value
of the job.
Unemployment benefits A worker searching for a job who remains jobless at
the end of period receives unemployment insurance benefits equal to z. Benefits are
financed through lump sum taxes and the government budget is balanced in each
period.
Splitting of surplus If a firm and a worker who have met separated, both
would loose the opportunity of producing and each would have to go through a timeconsuming process of search before meeting a new suitable partner. Hence, there is a
surplus from a job. We allow for different ways of splitting such surplus. The surplus
splitting mechanism is determined at the time when the match is formed. We assume
that with probability 1−θ the wage determination process in a job is governed by Nash
bargaining (Pissarides, 2000). In this case the worker and the firm split the net surplus
of a job by using a generalized Nash bargaining solution in which the bargaining powers
of the worker and the firm are β and 1 − β, respectively. Division of the surplus is

17

accomplished via wage payments.10 Bargaining takes place after the searching process
has concluded, so unemployment is the relevant outside option for the worker. When
unemployed, the worker cashes unemployment benefits and has to wait for next period
to search for a job. This timing assumption is particularly appropriate because it will
imply that the Hosios (1990) condition is satisfied.11
With probability θ the job is instead characterized by rigid wages as in Shimer
(2004) and Hall (2005). If these wages are inside the bargaining set, then the firm pays
to the worker the deterministic quantity ω. If the wage is outside the bargaining set
the outside option of either the worker or the firm binds.12
Aggregate resource constraint The aggregate resource constraint is:
Yt = It + Ct + Dt + Lt ,
where Dt is an aggregate demand exogenous component (say due to government expenditures or net trade balances) that we assume evolves as
dt ≡ ln Dt = (1 − ρd )d + ρd dt−1 + εdt .

(15)

Lt = (1 − κ) pκt St

(16)

Moreover we have that

represent the total amount of output units spent for job creation purposes, which is
obtained combining (13) and (8). Notice that
Lxt = κpκt St ,
10

(17)

As emphasized by Haefke, Sonntag, and Van-Rens (2007) and Pissarides (2009), the allocation
of resources in the decentralized equilibrium is unaffected by whether bargaining occurs continuously
over time or just at the start of the employment relationship—and then wages are set through longterm wage contracts. What matters is just the share of the surplus that the firm and the worker
appropriates as implied by β. So we are silent about the exact time profile of wages.
11
An alternative assumption would be to assume that matching and bargaining occurs simultaneously. This would be a fiction given that newly created jobs are created after a match. Under this
alternative assumption the Hosios condition would not be satisfied.
12
In the presence of a unique deterministic rigid wage, the wage can jump discontinuously in response
to a shock that makes the outside option of one party binding. To solve this problem we follow Hall
(2005), Hall and Milgrom (2008) and Gertler and Trigari (2009) in assuming that wages are always
strictly within the bargaining set. Although this assumption is reasonable, this approach might create
problems in estimating the model. In Justiniano, Lopez-Salido, and Michelacci (2010) we allow ω to
be an job specific time varying idiosyncratic shock. This makes solution methods based on linearizing
the equilibrium conditions of the model more appropriate. With stochastic rigid wages outside options
always bind for at least some workers and some firms and shocks affect the fraction of workers and
firms for which outside options are binding. Since fractions move continuously in response to shocks,
solution methods based on linearization are appropriate. To simplify exposition, here we avoided
pursuing this line of reasoning.

18

denotes instead the total recruiting costs due to the purchase of labour intensive intermediate goods.
Representative household The economy is populated by a continuum of identical infinitely-lived households of measure one. Each household is thought of as a large
extended family which contains a continuum of workers. The population of workers
in the economy is normalized to one and there are no movements in and out of the
labor force. We follow, among others, Andolfatto (1996) and Den-Haan, Ramey, and
Watson (2000) in assuming that workers pool their income at the end of the period and
choose consumption and effort costs to maximize the sum of the expected utility of the
household’s members; thus a representative household exists. Workers can be either
employed or non-employed. The utility obtained by the representative household in a
period is given by:
λt

U (Ct ) − et Ψ + et−1 e− µ O(Λt )

(18)

where et denotes the number of employed worker at the end of period t, Ct denotes
aggregate consumption, Ψ is a leisure cost of working, the last term accounts for job
maintenance costs which are incurred by all jobs producing in the previous period. We
assume that consumption utility is a standard constant relative risk aversion utility
function so that
U (Ct ) =

Ct1−χ − 1
1−χ

When χ = 1 preferences are logarithmic, when χ = 0 preferences are linear as in
the textbook presentation of the search model in Pissarides (2000). The household’s
discount factor is Bt where
bt ≡ ln Bt = (1 − ρb )b + ρb bt−1 + εbt ,

(19)

so that as in Primiceri, Schaumburg, and Tambalotti (2006) and Justiniano, Primiceri,
and Tambalotti (2010) we allow for shocks to the discount factor. Generally speaking, these shocks characterize the effects of changes in the supply of capital—due for
example to changes in financial market conditions that affects households’ ability to
save and invest. For example, notice that, when preferences are linear (χ = 0), bt
represents an exogenous shocks to the rental price of capital services.
We assume that the claims on the profit streams of firms are traded. In equilibrium
the household owns a diversified portfolio of all such claims, implying that the discount
factor used by firms to discount future profits from time t + i to t is consistent with the
household’s intertemporal decisions and so they share the same discount factor. The
19

representative household maximizes the expected present value of its instantaneous
utility (18), subject to the per period budget constraint:
Ct + Kt+1 = [1 − δ (jt )] Kt + [θω + (1 − θ)wtb ]et + rtk jt Kt + (1 − et )z − Υt

(20)

where wtb is the average wage paid in a bargained wage job while Υt represents lump
sump taxes, which satisfies
Υt = Dt + (1 − et )z.
This last follows from the fact that government budget is balanced. Notice that (20)
incorporates the assumption that households accumulate capital, they decide capital
utilization and thereby the capital services jt Kt to supply to firms.
Timing We adopt the following convention about the timing of events within a
period t:
i. Aggregate shocks εat , εϕt , εmt , ελt , εbt , and εdt are realized;
ii. Investment in job maintenance;
iii. Old jobs realize whether they are destroyed (which occurs with probability Λt )
and workers can search for a new job in the same period;
iv. Decisions about job creation are taken;
v. Old jobs and new jobs (resulting from matches at time t) produce output. Then
income is pooled, invested and consumed. Next period begins.

4

Equilibrium conditions

We now characterize the equilibrium conditions of the decentralized economy.
Consumption, investment and capital utilization At every point in time
the marginal value of wealth πt (i.e. the Lagrange multiplier of the representative
household’s budget constraint) is equal to the marginal utility of consumption so that
πt =

Ctχ

where δ 0 (jt ) denotes the derivative of the function δ in (5) with respect to capital

value of the fall in capital of δ 0 (jt ) at time t + 1.
Value of a job The value of searching for a job in period t measured in utils is
denoted by Ht which solves the asset type equation

Ht = ft θWtr + (1 − θ)Wtb + (1 − ft ) Ut

(25)

where Wti , i = b, r denotes the value to the worker of being employed in a job where
wages are set through Nash bargaining i = b, or where wages are rigid i = r. The right
hand side of (25) takes into account that with probability 1 − ft the worker remains
unemployed whose value is denoted by Ut that solves
Ut = πt z + Bt Et (Ht+1 ) .

(26)

This incorporates the fact that the unemployed worker cashes unemployment insurance
benefits z and he waits for next period before searching for a job. The time-t (private)
net value in utils of a job is defined as equal to Vt ≡ Pti +Wti −Ut . This is the net surplus
that workers and firms have to split when bargaining over wages. This incorporates

equal to the difference between the value produced in the job and the sum of the effort
cost of working and the benefits that the worker would obtain if unemployed. The last
term in (27) is the future gains from producing today. These gains are net of the future
investment in job maintenance and they are obtained only if the job is not destroyed.13
Notice O is utility from leisure and so it enters positively in the expression.This is
convenient to simplify notation.
A derivation for the expression of the net surplus in (27) We now derive
from first principle the expression for the net surplus of a job in (27). Let denote by
Pt the value of a job to the firm and by Wt the value of the job to the worker. Both
expressed in utility terms. With this notation we have that
Vt ≡ Pt + Wt − Ut
Let wt denote a worker’s wage. Then
Pt = πt (pt − wt ) + Bt Et [(1 − Λt+1 ) Pt+1 ]
The value of a job to the worker is equal to
i
h
λ
− t+1
µ
O(Λt+1 )
Wt = πt wt − Ψ + Bt Et (1 − Λt+1 ) Wt+1 + Λt+1 Ht+1 + e
which incorporates the fact that the worker loses the job in the next period with
probability Λt+1 . In that case the worker can search for another job in the same period,
whose value is Ht+1 . By summing Pt to Wt and then subtracting the expression for Ut
in (26) from the resulting expression we obtain that
Vt ≡ πt pt − Ψ − πt z − Bt Et (Ht+1 )
i
h
λt+1
+Bt Et (1 − Λt+1 ) (Jt+1 + Wt+1 ) + Λt+1 Ht+1 + e− µ O(Λt+1 )
which is equal to
h
i
λt+1
Vt ≡ πt pt − Ψ − πt z + Bt Et (1 − Λt+1 ) (Vt+1 + Ut+1 − Ht+1 ) + e− µ O(Λt+1 )
which is analogous to (27). 
13

An alternative assumption would be to assume that Vt ≡ Jt + Wt − Ht . This is equivalent to
assuming that matching and bargaining occurs simultaneously. This would be a fiction given that
newly created jobs are created after a match. Under this alternative assumption the Hosios condition
would not be satisfied.

24

Job destruction The optimal level for job maintenance is set to equate the
marginal cost of the investment in maintenance to its return—equal to the expected
increase in value due to the marginal fall in the job separation probability, so
λt

e− µ O0 (Λt ) = Jt .

(30)

By inverting this expression we can obtain that
Λt ≡ Λ exp [−µ (ln Jt − ln J) − λt ]

(31)

where Jt is given in (29), J is its steady state value while λt characterizes a job specific
shock to the separation rate. This last specification is parsimonious and captures key
properties of model with endogenous job separation. When µ = 0, the job separation rate is just driven by the exogenous shock λt . When µ > 0, investment in job
maintenance is more valuable when the job net surplus is greater. As a result the
job destruction rate falls. This negative relation between job destruction and the job
net surplus is the key insight of any model where job separation rate is endogenously
determined so as to maximize the job net surplus (see for example Mortensen and Pissarides, 1994). Generally equation (31) holds up to a first order approximation where
µ≡

O0
O00 Λ

.14 Notice that (30) implies that the relation between the net surplus and the

separation rate is characterized by an envelope condition. As emphasized by Pissarides
(2009) this implies that changes in the separation rate has nil first order effects on the
expected net value of a newly created job. The model is parameterized just in terms
of Λ and µ. Intuitively Λ determines the average steady state separation rate while µ
determines the elasticity of the job separation rate to the job net surplus.
Splitting of the job net surplus Let Pti , i = b, r denote the value to the firm
of a job where wages are set through Nash bargaining i = b, or where wages are rigid
i = r. Recall that Wti , i = b, r denotes the analogous value to the worker. Notice that
for any i we have Vt = Pti + Wti − Ut . We assume that Nash bargaining implies that
Wtb = βVt + Ut

and

Ptb = (1 − β) Vt

The value to the worker of a job with rigid wages satisfies
Wtr = Vt − Ptr + Ut

To understand the expression notice that the first two terms calculate the value of the

The job in the next period is destroyed with probability Λt+1 .

cost of filling the vacancy (equal to the sum of the cost of processing application for the
vacancies plus the cost for the worker training) to the expected net capital gains (the
term in the right hand side). In equilibrium the cost of processing the applications is
equal to its marginal cost, that given the functional form for R̃ is equal to
rvt = rt

equates the marginal costs of producing one unit of S to the marginal gains.15 The

Unemployment and pool of searchers There is an inflow to the stock of

stock of workers searching for a job evolves as
st = (1 − ft−1 ) st−1 + Λt et−1

Since the labor force is normalized to one, the number of employed workers who produce
output at the end of period satisfies
et + ut = 1

(41)

where ut denotes the unemployment rate, i.e. the number of worker who do not produce

ut = (1 − ft ) st

(42)

ut = ut−1 + Λt (1 − ut−1 ) − ft st

(43)

which evolves as

This says that unemployment changes are equal to the difference between the inflow
into and outflow from unemployment.16 Notice that this formulation implies that
unemployment at time t is influenced by both the separation rate and the finding rate
at time t. The outflow rate from unemployment is equal to
outt = ft

(44)

int = Λt

(45)

the inflow rate to unemployment is

which is consistent with the definition in Elsby et al. (2010).

Welfare

It is always useful to analyze the welfare properties of the model relative to the Hosios
(1990) benchmark—often labeled as the β = η condition. It is easy to prove that
16

Notice that if we define the separation rate as equal to
e t = (1 − ft )Λt ,

we obtain a more canonical expression for the law of motion of unemployment Lagging the second

Proposition 1 The decentralized equilibrium is socially efficient if the Hosios condition holds (β = η), there are no appropriability problems (γn = 0), wages are flexible
(θ = 0) and there are no unemployment benefits (z = 0).
The Proposition highlights that there are three possible sources of inefficiencies in
the model. All them stem from frictions in the labour market and they have already
been emphasized before. Inefficiencies arise because of either failure of the Hosios
(1990) condition (β is different from η); or because of appropriability problems in
creation costs as in Caballero and Hammour (1996, 1998) (γn is different from zero);
or because of wage rigidity as in Shimer (2004) and Hall (2005) (θ is different from
zero). Notice that these frictions could have different welfare costs depending of the
type of shocks and their sign. When the Hosios condition is satisfied it is optimal to
set benefits to zero, z = 0. Notice that if either γn is positive or θ is positive it never
exists a value of β that makes the decentralized equilibrium efficient.

Model solution and state-space representation

This section briefly describes the solution of the model and its state space representation. Let
Et [f (ζt+1 , ζt , ζt−1 , eεt , Γ)] = 0,

(46)

denote the collection of equilibrium conditions from Section 4, where ζt , εt and Γ are
vectors of endogenous and exogenous variables, exogenous i.i.d. disturbances, and,
unknown parameters, respectively.
For a given Γ, the first step is to find the non-stochastic steady state, which requires
solving for the root of a function in f , the finding probability. Having obtained the nonstochastic steady state we then log-linearize (46) around it and solve the resulting linear
system of rational expectation equations using the Anderson and Moore algorithm (see
Anderson (2008)). This procedure yields the following system of transition equations
ξˆt = G (Γ) ξˆt−1 + M (Γ) εt ,

(47)

where the b denotes log deviations from the steady state, while G (Γ) and M (Γ) are
conformable matrices whose elements are functions of Γ.
The state space representation of the model solution has (47) as transition equation.
The associated observation equation
yt = Z ξˆt + Rηt

29

(48)

maps some of the elements in ζ̂t into a vector of observables, yt , through the selection
matrix Z. The vector ηt represents idiosyncratic disturbances that do not enter the
equilibrium conditions, and the matrix R maps each of the i.i.d. elements in ηt to a
single observable series, with R having more columns than rows. Idiosyncratic disturbances capture deviations between some observables and the corresponding variable in
the model and are discussed at length in the next Section.
Given the data, Y = [y1, y2 , .., yT ], the likelihood function associated with each
parameter Γ is obtained through the Kalman filter using the transition equation (47)
and observation equation (48). This allows us not only to estimate model parameters
but also to infer (through the Kalman smoother) the shocks, [ε0t , ηt0 ], buffeting our
economy at each point in time. We later exploit this feature to decompose cyclical
fluctuations across shocks and to conduct counterfactual experiments.
6

Bayesian Inference

We use Bayesian methods to characterize the posterior distribution of the structural
parameters (see An and Schorfheide 2007 for a survey). The posterior distribution
combines the prior with the likelihood function obtained with the Kalman filter. The
likelihood is based on the following vector of observable variables:


ln ut , ln vt , ln GDPt , ln Ct , ln It , ln fτA , ln ΛA
τ ,

(49)

corresponding to quarterly (t) unemployment rate, vacancy rate, GDP , consumption
and investment, as well as annual (τ ) averages of the quarterly finding and separation probabilities, respectively. GDP is defined as output net of recruiting costs,
GDP = Y − L. The data are discussed in Section 2, which also details the country
specific samples. Our guiding choices in eliciting priors warrant a thorough discussion,
especially given the relatively short samples used in the estimation.
Calibrated parameters A few parameters that are difficult to pin down without
level information are calibrated. In some cases we set the same value for all countries.
For instance, the quarterly depreciation rate of capital δ is set to 10 percent per year,
2.5 percent per quarter which is similar to Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997).
The discount factor B is fixed to .9901, delivering a steady state real interest rate of
4 percent, while the elasticity of output to capital, α, is calibrated to 0.33. Finally,
we impose a coefficient of relative risk aversion, χ, equal to one, corresponding to log
preferences. Other parameters are calibrated using country specific information. The
replacement rate of unemployment benefits, is set to the value reported in Table 1
30

for each country. The steady state value of

D
,
GDP

which measures the share of GDP

not accounted for by the sum of consumption and investment, is chosen using nominal
national accounts data. This delivers percentage shares of 17% for the US, 24% in
France, 21% Germany, 19% the United Kingdom, 27% Norway, and, 34% Sweden.
Notice that this share is smallest in the US, although close to that in the UK.17 Finally,
the steady state value of the separation probability, Λ, is calibrated to the sample means
reported in Table 1.
For the remaining parameters, the prior is identical across countries and described
in Table 4. The second column corresponds to the type of density, with “N” denoting
Normal, “B” Beta, “G” Gamma, “U” Uniform, and “I” Inverse Gamma1. Beta distributions are reserved for variables defined over the [0,1] intervals, while G and I are only
defined for the positive real line. For each distribution the third and fourth column
report the prior mean and standard deviation, respectively. To help gauge the range
of values entailed by each density, the last column reports 98 percent prior probability
intervals.
Matching elasticity, factor content of recruiting service, and effort cost
The elasticity of the matching function with respect to unemployment, η, is centered
around 0.6. This value accords well with the evidence summarized by Petrongolo and
Pissarides (2001) who conclude that “a plausible range for the empirical elasticity of
unemployment is 0.5 to 0.8 ”. Shimer (2005a) argues in favor of a higher value of
η = 0.72, in line with the simple regression results reported in Table 1. There is scant
evidence about the value of κ that measures the weight of labor goods in creation costs,
though Shimer (2010) argues that this parameter might matter for cyclical fluctuations.
For this reason we specify a fairly flat Beta prior, with prior probability intervals that
cover the unit interval. Our prior for the disutility of labor Ψ is informed by the
estimation of the model with higher frequency data for the US. In Justiniano, LopezSalido, and Michelacci (2010), we estimate the model for the US using monthly and
quarterly data which, given the larger sample, delivers more precise estimates.18 The
estimate for Ψ obtained in that sample under a uniform [0,50] prior, once converted
to a quarterly frequency, suggests a value for this parameter considerably smaller than
0.4. However, in order not to penalize specifications with low net (private) surplus for a
job, we center our prior around this higher value. Furthermore, prior beliefs regarding
D
C+Y
More specifically GDP
= 1 − GDP
, encompassing therefore government expenditures and net
exports.
18
We checked that the US results with the higher frequency data-set used in Justiniano, LopezSalido, and Michelacci (2010) and the low-frequency data set used here yield consistent results.

Notes: Priors in estimation. First column, corresponds to the parameters names. Second column
is the type of density. “N”is for Normal, “B” for Beta, “G” for Gamma, “U” for Uniform, and “I”
for Inverse Gamma. Third column is the mean while the fourth is the standard deviation. The last
column reports the prior percentage band with 98 percent probability coverage. For unemployment
the band is reported as a difference with the sample mean. The replacement rate of unemployment
benefits, the steady state value of the D over Y − L ratio and the separation rate Λ are calibrated to
their value in Table 1.

Ψ for other countries are grounded on the assumption that workers preferences are
similar across countries, so that working effort costs also vary little across countries.
Adjustment costs and job separation elasticity For the parameter T

00

that

governs adjustment costs in capital, we follow Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti
32

(2010) (and references therein) in centering the Gamma density at 4, albeit with a fairly
large standard error. Absent any evidence to guide an alternative choice, we specify
the same distribution for adjustment costs in recruiting services, G00 . The elasticity
of depreciation with respect to utilization is determined by the ratio

δ2
,
δ1

where the

denominator is pinned down by the steady state and it is equal across countries to
0.035. We elicit a prior for δ2 which implies an apriori median for

δ2
δ1

of roughly 5.5, but

with a standard deviation of 5.5 as well, thereby encompassing a wide range of values
suggested in the literature, see Rios-Rull, Schorfheide, Fuentes-Albero, SantaeulaliaLlopis, and Kryshko (2011) for a discussion. Finally given the large debate on the
importance of fluctuations in job separation probabilities over the business cycle we
set a pretty loose prior for the parameter µ that governs the sensitivity of job separation
to the job net surplus.
Wage rigidity and bargaining power We consider fairly uninformative priors for
the importance of wage stickiness θ, and workers’ bargaining power β. There is much
debate in the literature about the value of these parameters. Hall (2005) argues in favor
of θ = 1, while Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) are inclined toward θ = 0. Similar
considerations apply for the value of β that characterize workers’ bargaining power.
For this reason, we use a Beta-distribution with mean 0.5 and standard deviation
0.25, which is very close to a uniform distribution and, as mentioned above, covers
the unit interval. We impose that in steady state wages are the same in a rigid and a
bargaining wage job. This implies that the two types of jobs differ just in their wage
response to aggregate labor market fluctuations and formalizes the idea that wage
rigidity does not matter for steady state allocations. From the estimation point of
view, this parametrization reduces by one the set of parameters to be estimated.
Steady state unemployment rate Following the methodology outlined in DelNegro and Schorfheide (2008) we also impose priors on two relevant steady state quantities. First, we set a tight prior on (100 times) the steady state unemployment rate,
choosing a Normal with a mean informed by the sample average reported in Table 1
and standard deviation of 0.2. This approach helps shield against implausibly large
steady state unemployment rates which might spuriously help the model to fit the data
for reasons discussed in Cole and Rogerson (1999).
Job creation costs The second steady state prior concerns the costs of job creation,
and requires a detailed explanation. As emphasized by Pissarides (2009), job creation

33

costs, particularly if unrelated to labor market conditions, can significantly influence
the transmission mechanisms of neutral shocks. We discipline this mechanism through
a prior on the steady state costs of job creation, while adopting an agnostic Uniform
[0,500] for the parameters governing the contribution of vacancy costs, γv , and training
costs, γn . More specifically, to restrict the value of recruiting costs we focus on the
ratio



η
r γn + γv f 1−η
ϑ=

p
Roughly ϑ measures the cost of hiring a worker relative to the productivity of the
worker in the job. Silva and Toledo (2011) calculate that hiring a worker requires 4.3
percent of the quarterly wage of a newly hired worker and that hiring also requires
some training costs that amounts to 55 percent of quarterly wages. Under these values
ϑ=
where

w
p

(0.043 + 0.55)w
p

is roughly the labor share multiplied by 1 − α. So we obtain that, when the

labor share is equal to 1 − α,
2
ϑ ∼ (0.043 + 0.55) (1 − α) ∼ 0.593.
3
We take this value of 0.593 as an upper bound for the set of reasonable values of ϑ. For
this reason, the prior for this parameter is centered at 0.15, with a standard deviation
of 0.1. This has a 98 percent prior probability interval roughly covering [0.01,0.47],
such that the value for ϑ suggested by Silva and Toledo (2011) is well into the right
tail of the prior distribution.19
Shocks All shocks are normalized to zero in logs (such that means are one in levels),
except B (discount factor), and D (exogenous demand component), whose calibrated
levels have been already discussed. Regarding persistence, our prior Beta density for ρa
is centered at 0.85, suggesting that neutral technology shocks are highly autocorrelated,
following the RBC literature. For all remaining shocks, ρi , i = ϕ, λ, b, d, m,, the prior
mean is 0.6 with a standard deviation of 0.2, which allows a fairly broad degree of
autocorrelation.
As it is customary in the empirical DSGE literature, Inverse Gamma 1 densities
are preferred for the prior standard deviation of the innovation to the shocks. While
19

The median is 0.12 while the 90 percent prior probability band covers instead [0.03,0.34], making
evident that this density favors values considerably smaller than those suggested by Silva and Toledo
(2011). Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) also add some costs from keeping capital idle which might
justify increasing the variance for the prior.

34

we allow the means to differ somewhat across shocks, we select the degrees of freedom
that parametrize this density to be equal to 2, which results in an infinite variance.
The estimation of model parameters through likelihood based methods is unfeasible
when the number of shocks is smaller than the number of series in the dataset. In this
case the model is stochastically singular, counterfactually predicting that some linear
combination of the observables must hold exactly in the data. To break stochastic
singularity we introduce idiosyncratic errors in vacancies, finding and separation probabilities. These shocks, given by ηt in section 5, enter only the observation equation
of each corresponding series, and are assumed serially uncorrelated and orthogonal to
any other disturbance in the model. Therefore, idiosyncratic disturbances are unable
to pick up the comovement in the data.
Aside from the above technical considerations, there are good reasons to allow for
some idiosyncratic error in the measure of vacancies, job finding and job separation
probabilities. For the case of vacancies, this idiosyncratic error may capture some wellknown measurement issues with the Help Wanted Index. With regards to labor flows,
idiosyncratic shocks may account for time aggregation issues. Furthermore, alternative
measures of these probabilities tend to accord well in their cyclical components but can
display notable differences in high frequency behavior. This is evident for France and
the UK in comparing our measures of worker flows probabilities with those based on
the data by Petrongolo and Pissarides (2008) and for the US when contrasting our
time series with those in Shimer (2005b).Idiosyncratic shocks can also pick up model
misspecification, due to movements in and out of the labor force that the model ignores.
To limit the influence of idiosyncratic disturbances, the volatility of idiosyncratic
shock i = v, f ind, sep in country j is confined to the interval [0,qji ], with qji equal to half
of the standard deviation of series i in that country. The estimated standard deviation
of each idiosyncratic shock is equal to ξqji , where ξ has a Beta prior centered at 0.3
with standard deviation 0.2. Despite this approach, the extent to which idiosyncratic
disturbances may undermine our ability to learn about the cyclical behavior of the
labor market should be judged by how important are these shocks over the business
cycle, an issue analyzed extensively in the next section.

Estimation results

The presentation of our results begins with the estimated parameters in Section 7.1.
Section 7.2 comments on the model’s ability to fit cross-correlations and volatilities.
The role of technology shocks in generating fluctuations is taken up in Section 7.3. To
this end, we use a historical decomposition of the observables as driven by only tech35

nology shocks (both neutral and investment specific) to show that their contribution
to labor market fluctuations varies considerably across countries. Before remarking on
other shocks, Section 7.4 briefly digresses on the role of wage rigidity in increasing the
response of labor market variables to neutral technology shocks. The contribution of
all shocks to business cycle variations across countries and series is presented in section 7.5. We conclude in section 7.6 with a cross-country comparison of transmission
mechanisms, which helps probe why the importance of shocks differs across countries
and series.
7.1

Parameters estimates

The posterior mode for the parameters in each country is reported in Table 5, other
steady state quantities are reported in Table 6, while measures of uncertainty are
omitted due to space considerations.20
The model estimate for the degree of wage rigidity, θ, is highest in the US at 0.57,
suggesting that wages are more rigid than in Europe. This might be because European
trade unions target their demand for wages in new jobs to aggregate labor market
conditions. Conversely, β in the US is estimated at 0.51, hinting that workers have
greater bargaining power in Europe than in the US.
The elasticity of the matching function to unemployment η is similar across countries and close to the value reported in table 1. In contrast, estimates for the elasticity
of separations µ vary considerably across countries, from 0.44 in Sweden to almost 2
in Norway, with the US on the low side at 0.83. This is in line with the conclusions
by Elsby et al. (2010) that the separation margin matters more in Europe, see also
Section 2. Recruiting relies mostly on labor, especially in the US where κ is highest at
0.9, consistent with the model specification in Shimer (2010).
According to our estimates there is a fair degree of adjustment costs in both capital and recruiting efforts in most countries. While the former friction is standard in
empirical RBC models, we find that a similar mechanism is crucial to account for the
high persistence of vacancies. As emphasized by Fujita and Ramey (2007) and Ravn
and Simonelli (2008), this is a salient empirical feature of vacancies and labor market tightness. Posterior estimates for δ2 imply relatively large elasticities of capital
20

When estimating structural models it is not uncommon to find alternative parameter configurations that provide similar characterizations of the data. To gauge whether identification issues
manifest in multiple local modes, we maximize the posterior density using alternative optimization
algorithms initialized with at least 50 random draws generated from a uniform grid, overdispersed
relative to our prior. While this procedure is silent on the role of priors in achieving identification, it
does reveal a unique parameter mode for each country.

Notes: Estimates. In all estimates χ is set to one. The replacement rate of unemployment in benefits

The value of the wage in bargained jobs in steady state is equal to ω.

this accords well with the importance of variable capital utilization for the propagation
of intertemporal shocks, such as variations in the households discount factor and the

37

investment specific technology (Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman 1988).
Table 6 reports the steady state implied by these estimates. In each country the
finding probability and unemployment rate are well in line with the sample means in
Table 1.
The estimates of γn in Table 5 tends to be higher in Germany than in other countries
but training costs are in general small. Vacancies posting costs γv vary substantially
across countries. However, this masks significant differences in the magnitude of job
creation costs as a share of GDP. For this reasons, Table 6 also reports the ratio between
total job creation costs equal to


η
LT = r γn + γv f 1−η n,
and aggregate GDP equal to Y − L. This ratio tends to be lower in Europe due to
lower worker turnover.21
To characterize the value of rents in existing jobs, Table 6 reports two statistics.
The first is the flow value of ex-post surplus in output units relative to productivity

term

in (51) is simply the flow value equivalent of the ex ante cost in training.22

The numbers for AFS and PFS reported in Table 6 indicate that ex-ante and ex-post
surpluses are similar. This implies that training costs matter little for the economic

Our estimates for the values of the job net surplus seem to be in line with the values
used by Shimer (2005a) in his calibration—although one has to be careful here because
the choice for the time length of a period matters. As a point of reference the flow
value of surplus is equal to 0.05 in the calibration of the search model in Hagedorn and
Manovskii (2008) and equal to 0.6 in the calibration by Shimer (2005a).

Notes: Steady state means corresponding to the parameter estimates in Table 5. LT denotes the
total costs for job creation (both for labor and output). GDP is equal to (Y − L). PFS is equal to
(p − Ψ
π − z)/p and corresponds to the ex-post flow value of the net surplus of a job. AFS is equal to
Ψ
(p − π − z − r+Λ
1+r γn )/p and corresponds to the ex-ante flow value of the net surplus of a job.

Properties of shocks Neutral technology shocks are highly persistent in line with
the RBC literature. The volatility of its innovations is lowest in the US and highest
in Norway and Sweden, consistent with the discrepancies in business cycle variability
documented in Table 1. Nonetheless, as it will become evident shortly, cross-countries
differences in the volatility of neutral shocks are rather small, at least relative to the
variation in estimates for the standard deviation and persistence of other disturbances.
The properties of investment shocks, ϕ, vary considerably across countries. These
shocks are most persistent in France, with ρϕ at 0.6, but much closer to white noise in
the remaining European countries, particularly Norway where ρϕ is 0.13—in line with
39

the very low correlation for GDP reported in Table 1. In general investment shocks
are substantially more volatile in Europe than in the US, especially so in Norway.
For Norway this last observation likely reflects the indirect effects of oil extraction,
a notoriously capital intensive industry. As for the remaining European countries,
the volatility of these shocks is somewhat out of line with the differences in standard
deviations for investment documented in section 2.2.
Estimates of the volatility of job destruction shocks σλ are also fairly different across
countries, being five times larger in Norway than in the US, and even more so in Germany. The variability of innovations to matching shocks, σm is lowest in the US and
Sweden, and highest in Germany, Norway and the UK. These differences in estimates
accord well with the high correlation between finding and separation probabilities observed for these countries, see Table 2. This is because, as emphasized by Hosios
(1994) and further discussed in Section 7.6, disturbances to the matching technology
have the distinctive feature of generating a positive comovement between finding and
separation probabilities. Regarding persistence, the autocorrelation in separation and
matching shocks are broadly in the 0.5-0.8 range, while Norway stands out again, with
0.11 estimates for ρλ and ρm .
Idiosyncratic shocks are quite volatile, and more so in Europe, which largely reflects
the larger standard deviations in labor market data compared to the US. The variance
of idiosyncratic shocks is pretty large in all countries for both finding and separation
probabilities and close to the upper bounds allowed, that is the estimated τ close
to 1. The sole exception is the US, where the standard deviation of idiosyncratic
disturbances to unemployment inflows is significantly smaller than the upper bound.
This is an indirect indication that the model fits this series best in the US, as we latter
corroborate. Idiosyncratic shocks to vacancies are generally small with the exception
of France. This is mostly due to the low association between the vacancy rate and the
unemployment rate and finding probability present in the French data (see Table 2),
which is a common theme throughout our discussion of results for France.
7.2

Model fit: correlogramm and volatilities

We now discuss the model’s ability to fit key moments of the data. We first focus on
the comovement properties and then analyze how the model performs in matching the
volatility of national accounts and labor market variables.
Figure 2 presents the actual and model-implied correlation pattern of the seven
variables used to estimate the model for the US. Figure 2b-f in the Appendix present
analogous graphs for the other five countries in the sample. The panel in row i and
40

column j corresponds to the cross-correlation between series i and up to 3 lags, k =
0, 1, 2, 3, of series j. Given the mixed frequency of the data, one lag corresponds to
one year for moments involving unemployment flow variables, and to one quarter for
the remaining series. The moments in the data are given by the solid line. Dashed
lines instead report 95 percent posterior probability bands obtained for each country
using the estimated parameter mode reported in Table 5 to simulate 4000 artificial
model replications of length equal to the data. The median of the implied posterior
distribution of the model generated correlations is shown by the dotted line.
Since each figure reports a fairly large number of moments, we limit our discussion
to fairly broad features of the model and the data, and we concentrate on the US.
Overall, Figure 2a suggests that the model matches reasonably well the correlation
pattern of all the seven observables in the US although, admittedly, some confidence
intervals are large, which reflects both the relatively short sample period and the low
sample frequency considered for some variables. When looking at labor market variables, the model is successful in reproducing the remarkably high serial correlation of
vacancies, unemployment and job finding probabilities observed in the data. The crosscorrelations between the unemployment rate, worker flows probabilities and vacancies
generated by the model align reasonably well with their empirical counterparts. For
instance, median model-based statistics for the separation probability are fairly close
to the actual moments, particularly at lags of this variable. Similarly, the comovement
properties between vacancies and unemployment generated by the model generally
agree with the data, although for leads of vacancies the correlations are somewhat
larger than those observed.

Figure 2: Cross-correlogram of the US model

Consistent with ample evidence from the RBC literature, the model captures the
serial correlation properties of national accounts variables quite well. Overall, the empirical correlation between labor market and national accounts variables are also within
the posterior probability bands, although the model predicts a somewhat stronger association between GDP and unemployment than in the data. Within the national
accounts series, the model underpredicts the correlation between consumption and
investment, mainly due to the substitution effect induced by investment specific technology shocks. The model fit of the correlation pattern for the other countries is
somewhat similar and omitted to save space, see Figure 2b-f in the Appendix.
Table 7 characterizes the model’s ability to reproduce the standard deviation of
the observables. Each column corresponds to a different country, each row to a different variable. As in the case of cross-correlations, we report the median and [5-95]
percentiles of the model implied distribution of standard deviations, together with the
same statistic in data—identical to the number reported in panel (B) of Table 1. Note
that the cross-country variation in implied volatilities is consistent with the heterogeneity observed in the data. Model-based standard deviations of unemployment and
vacancies also broadly agree with the data, being if, anything, slightly larger in the
model than in the data, in Germany, and, for vacancies in Sweden.
Empirical and model generated standard deviations of finding and separation probabilities are in close agreement, except for the UK and Sweden where the model falls
short of capturing the high volatility in separations. Focusing on national accounts
data, model-based volatilities in GDP and investment are reasonably in line, albeit
somewhat above, their empirical counterparts. In general the model overstates the
volatility of consumption, particularly in the Scandinavian countries, owing in part to
the comovement problem induced by investment specific technology shocks, alluded to
earlier. In summary, with only a few exceptions, the model accounts reasonably well
for the observed differences in volatility across countries.

Technology component in historical fluctuations

We now show that there are important cross-country differences in the ability of technology shocks to explain cyclical fluctuations in labor market variables. To isolate
the role of technology shocks alone in inducing volatility we perform a historical decomposition of the observables. This is possible thanks to the linearity of the model’s
state space representation, which allows decomposing the observed time series of each
variable as the sum of the components due to each shock.23 In this way, the historical
paths of the observables that would have been obtained in response only to technology
shocks (either neutral or investment specific) is shown as the solid lines in Figure 3.
The actual data are represented by the dashed line. Panels a-f correspond to a different
country. In each panel we consider all observables with the exception of consumption,
due to space considerations.
The bottom row in each panel makes evident that in all countries the technology
component accounts for the bulk of the cyclical variation in GDP and investment.
In contrast, important cross-country differences are visible when focusing on labor
market series. In the US (see panel a), technology shocks capture remarkably well the
historical evolution of unemployment, vacancies and finding probability—although they
slightly under-predict the fall in the finding probability during the recession of the early
1990s. This success in the US is more modest for separation probabilities. In Europe,
technology shocks explain virtually all of the cyclical fluctuations of unemployment
and vacancies in Scandinavian countries (panels d and e) and to a lesser extent in
Germany (panel c). But the technology component alone fails to match the magnitude
of unemployment fluctuations in France (panel b) and the UK (panel f), particularly
so during downturns. Technology shocks track the contours of finding probabilities in
Germany and Sweden, with fluctuations being considerably smaller that in the data
for Norway, the UK and particularly France. In Europe the technology component
also fails to reproduce an important part of the fluctuations of the job separation rate,
especially when considering the two Scandinavian countries. This last shortcoming
seems substantially more severe in all European countries than in the US.

More specifically, the Kalman smoother is used to infer the unique sequence of shocks, [ε0t , ηt0 ]
(in the notation in section 5), which reproduce the observables. One can then feed subsets of these
shocks, e.g. neutral and investment specific, through the model to obtain the components for each
series driven by those disturbances only.

Wage rigidity and the transmission of neutral shocks

Historical decompositions indicate that technology shocks alone are able to reproduce
the cyclical fluctuations in unemployment, vacancies and finding probabilities in the
US, and, amongst European countries most prominently Sweden, followed by Germany.
Estimates of wage rigidity are highest for these two countries, which hints that in our
empirical model wage rigidity plays an important role in solving the so called Shimer
puzzle, in line with the conclusions by Hall (2005), Shimer (2005a) and Shimer (2010).
Although the degree of wage rigidity seems well identified from our data, this observation is certainly limited by the absence of compensation measures to estimate the
model. Bearing this caveat in mind, we perform a simple counterfactual exercise to
distill the contribution of wage rigidity in propagating the effects of neutral technology in the US. Using the same methodology underlying our historical decompositions,
we condition on the estimated history of neutral shocks only and ask how the time
series of our observables would change if the degree of wage rigidity θ was half of its
estimated value. All other parameters are left unchanged.24 Notice that the change in
θ leaves unaffected all steady state quantities. Comparing the historical and the counterfactual resulting series driven by only neutral technology shocks we find that the
cyclical properties of all series remain qualitatively unchanged, but volatility declines
considerably when there is less wage rigidity.25 This can be seen clearly from Table 8
that reports the standard deviations with low wage rigidity, θ = 0.28, estimated wage

rigidity θ = 0.56 and in the data. With θ = 0.28 the volatility of unemployment,
vacancies and finding probability would be roughly 3/5 of the value obtained under
the estimated value of θ.
7.5

Contribution of shocks to business cycles

The conclusions from the visual inspection of Figure 3 are confirmed by performing
a formal decomposition of the business cycle variance of the observables. Figures 4
reports the contribution of each shock to the variance of observables in each country
at business cycle frequencies, which correspond to cycles between 6 and 32 quarters,
as in Stock and Watson (1999). We compute the spectral density implied by the state
space representation of the DSGE model and decompose the variation of its diagonal
elements within the frequency band associated with business cycle fluctuations. In this
case we report decompositions at the quarterly horizon for all series.
To save space we focus on unemployment in panel (a), vacancy in panel (b), the flow
probabilities in panel (c) and (d), GDP in panel (e) and investment in panel (f). In each
panel a country corresponds to a different bar. A more detailed variance decomposition
is reported in Table 9 in the Appendix. Panel (e) shows that neutral technology shocks
account for roughly 1/2 of the business cycle variability in GDP across all countries.
Investment specific shocks explain between 20 and 30 percent of cyclical movements in
GDP, with shares being somewhat higher in the US and Norway. In general matching
and job destruction shocks have a limited role in GDP and investment fluctuations,
although their combined contribution is relatively larger in Great Britain and France.
Decompositions for consumption (omitted due to space considerations) also reveal a
high degree of homogeneity in the driving forces of national accounts data. While
neutral shocks are important for both investment and consumption in all countries,
investment specific shocks explain about half of investment variability, and discount
factor shocks account for 1/3 of consumption fluctuations.
Turning to unemployment (panel a), it is clear that there is substantially more
heterogeneity in its cyclical drivers, compared to national accounts data, in line with
the evidence from Figure 3. Neutral shocks capture about 2/3 of cyclical fluctuations
in unemployment in the US and Sweden, roughly 40 percent in Germany and Norway,
but less than 20 percent in France and Great Britain. Conversely, matching shocks
are far more important in these last two countries—contributing almost half of the
cycle in unemployment. Furthermore, almost 50 percent of the cyclical variance in
unemployment is due to job destruction shocks in France, with smaller shares elsewhere,
especially the US.

Cross-country differences in the sources of labor market fluctuations are also evident
in the job finding probability (panel c). As in the case of unemployment, neutral shocks
contribute fifty percent or more to the business cycle of the job finding probability in
the US, but play a far more muted role in Norway, Great Britain and France. On
the other hand, matching shocks account for the bulk of the cyclical variability in
the finding probability in France and Great Britain, yet less than 20 percent in the
US. Although idiosyncratic shocks are quite volatile, their explanatory power over the
business cycle is limited to roughly 10 percent.
Regarding the separation probability, its cyclical variation is driven mainly by job
destruction shocks in all countries, with a couple of notable exceptions (panel d). In
Norway, matching shocks are the dominant source of its fluctuation. Meanwhile, idiosyncratic shocks are superfluous everywhere except Sweden, where their contribution
reaches 30 percent.
In summary, focusing on the labor market, we find that neutral shocks explain
50

the bulk of cyclical variations in unemployment, vacancies and finding probability in
the US, Sweden and to lesser extent Germany. Broadly speaking matching and job
destruction shocks are less important for unemployment and finding probabilities in the
US and Sweden than in Norway, the UK and France, with Germany being somewhere
in between. Finally, the contribution of discount factor and aggregate demand shocks
to labor market variables is fairly limited.
7.6

Cross-country comparisons in transmission mechanism

We now compare impulse responses to shocks across countries. We organize the presentation by shock, with aggregate demand and discount factor shocks omitted given
their small contribution to business cycle variability, particularly in the labor market.
We focus on the same variables as in Figures 3 and 4. The discussion is useful to
clarify the comovement properties induced by each shock and to better understand the
source of identification in the data. With full information methods it is not possible
to claim with certainty that specific correlations are responsible for identification. Yet
comparing the correlations generated by each shock with those in the data can help to
understand why a particular disturbance plays a more important role in one country
than in another.
Figure 5a reports the impulse response to a unitary neutral technology shock, a .
Different lines in each box corresponds to a different country. Qualitatively, impulse
responses are very similar across countries. Neutral technology shocks work exactly
as in the canonical textbook search model discussed in Pissarides (2000) leading to
an increase in finding rates and a decrease in the separation rate, expanding output
while inducing unemployment and vacancies to move in opposite direction. As shown
in Table 1, large correlations with these signs—positive between finding and vacancies,
negative for both with unemployment—are found in the US, Sweden and to lesser extent
Germany, which helps explain why in these countries neutral shocks are prominent
contributors to cyclical labor market fluctuations. The comovements between vacancies
and both finding and the unemployment rate is instead substantially weaker in France,
where neutral shocks play a limited role in explaining the last two series.
Figure 5a also suggests some important differences across countries in the quantitative effects of neutral technology shocks on labor market variables. These elasticities
are in turn largest in Sweden (the country with the largest fluctuations in labor market variables in the data) followed by the US. In contrast, cross-country differences
in the response of GDP, investment and consumption (not shown) are comparatively
smaller. This said, caution is required when comparing the magnitude of impulse re51

sponses as they represent log deviations from (sometimes very) different steady states
(particularly when considering labor market variables). While this explains part of the
variation in magnitudes, differences are also evident across countries with similar levels of unemployment and labor flows. For instance, the elasticities of unemployment,
finding and vacancy rates are lowest for France, even compared to countries (such as
the UK and Germany) with similar unemployment rate and worker flow probabilities.
The responses to a unitary Marginal Efficiency of Investment shock, ϕ , are shown
in Figure 5b. MEI shocks are qualitatively similar to neutral shocks, but with stronger
impact effects on investment and a negative comovement between consumption and
investment—due to well-known substitution effects. This last observation suggests
that allowing for non separable preferences may substantially help the transmission of
MEI shocks, as suggested by Eusepi and Preston (2009). Finally, the propagation of
MEI shocks relies partly on strong responses in capital utilization, thereby rationalizing
the large utilization elasticities estimated in all countries.
Figure 5c presents the responses to a unitary matching shock, m . These disturbances have the distinctive property of generating a positive co-movement in finding
and separation probabilities. This helps explain the importance of matching shocks in
Norway, where the correlation between these two series is large and positive (Table 1).
When the separation rate is endogenous, the comovement between unemployment and
vacancies induced by matching shocks may be positive or negative, as noted by Hosios
(1994). This can be seen by comparing the impulse responses in the US and Germany,
where vacancies fall, with those in France and Great Britain in which unemployment
and vacancies move in the same direction. These considerations suggest first that it is
difficult to infer the importance of matching shocks by just looking at the properties
of the Beveridge curve and, second, that having worker flow probabilities in the set of
observables is important for identification. In general, matching shocks generate large
movements in finding probabilities loosely correlated with the level of vacancies. Since
the correlation between finding probability and vacancies is particularly low in France,
Norway and the UK, this helps explaining why in these countries matching shocks
account for a large share of the fluctuations in the job finding rate and unemployment.
Finally, Figure 5e traces out the effects of a unitary impulse in job destruction
shocks, λ . These disturbances drive any fluctuations in job separation probabilities
that are not due to fluctuations in the net value of a job. On impact, they tend to
generate a strong positive comovement between the separation probability and unemployment. The empirical correlation between these two series is relatively higher in
Germany and France, which helps partly explain why job destruction shocks are fairly

52

important for these countries.

Conclusions

In this paper we have set up a real business cycle model with search and matching frictions driven by several shocks. The model nests full Nash Bargaining and wage rigidity
as special cases and includes other transmission mechanisms suggested by the literature
for the propagation and amplification of disturbances. The model is estimated using
full information methods, allowing for mixed frequency data, to study the properties of
unemployment, vacancies, unemployment flows, output, consumption and investment
in six different OECD countries. We have focused on the ability of technology shocks
to generate cyclical fluctuations in line with the data. Our main finding is that while
technology shocks are the key driving force of national accounts variables in all countries, their contribution to labor market fluctuations vary substantially both between
the two sides of the Atlantic and across countries within Europe. Technology shocks
alone replicate remarkably well the volatility in vacancies, unemployment and finding
probabilities observed in the US. But their success is mixed in Europe where matching
shocks and job destruction shocks play a substantially more important role than in the
US.
Our analysis should be extended along several dimensions. For instance, the presentation here abstracts from an in-depth analysis of the merits and shortcomings of
competing transmission mechanisms and their role in shaping differences across countries. Relatedly, it would be interesting to understand why matching and job destruction shocks matter more in Europe than in the US. Looking at the effects of different
labor market institutions on the cyclical behavior of the labor market seems to be an
obvious first step in trying to answer these questions.
The theoretical framework could also be expanded to model flows in and out of the
labor force whose importance over the business cycle is likely to vary by country. In
addition, specifying more general preferences that allow for consumption hours complementarity might matter for results, as emphasized in Shimer (2010), particularly
considering some of the model’s difficulties in matching the comovement in consumption. One might also want to incorporate an intensive margin of labor supply, to
increase the menu of possible relevant shocks, or, to allow for a richer structure in the
way information about shocks gets revealed to agents in the economy—as in the case of
“news” shocks (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe 2008). Finally, although our cross-country
analysis has been feasible thanks to the availability of annual comparable data on
workers flows, it might be useful to specify the model at the monthly, instead of quarterly frequency. This modification will inherently limit the cross-country dimension of

57

the analysis but is particularly relevant for the US, where transitions occurs at very
high frequency.
In our view, the most compelling priority in expanding the model is to incorporate
direct measures of wages into the analysis and to better characterize the cyclical properties of the labor share. After all this is one of the key insights provided by Hagedorn
and Manovskii (2008) and Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2005). Of course in explaining the cyclical properties of the labor share one should build on Haefke, Sonntag,
and Van-Rens (2007) and Pissarides (2009) to recognize that wages in new and ongoing
jobs have very different implications for the allocation of resources in search models.
For example, and for given workers’ bargaining power, the allocation of resources is
unaffected by whether bargaining occurs continuously over time or just at the start
of the employment relationship by setting wages through long-term wage contracts.
However, different ways of splitting the surplus over the life of a match can matter
for the cyclical properties of the labor share. Moreover, the labor share exhibits rich
cyclical dynamics that, while informative, may prove challenging to model. In the US,
for instance, its correlation is negative with contemporaneous output, but positive with
output lagged three quarters or more–what Rı́os-Rull and Santaeulalia-Llopis (2010)
refer to as the overshooting property of the labor share. The former correlation suggests
that some wage rigidity is present in the US data, while the latter correlation indicates
that wages do respond to aggregate shocks, albeit with a lag. We are currently working
an a monthly model of wage determination to account for the cyclical properties of the
labor share in the US, which also incorporates some of the model extensions discussed
above.
As it is standard in the search and matching literature, our analysis is based on
a real model where disturbances to aggregate demand cannot be the main drivers of
cyclical fluctuations in output and employment. In alternative New Keynesian DSGE
models, where the presence of nominal rigidities makes output demand determined,
aggregate demand disturbances could have a lead role in cyclical fluctuations. Indeed,
when estimating versions of these models with no unemployment, the literature has
found evidence that demand shocks matter and that (neutral and investment specific)
technology shocks play a more limited role in generating business cycles (Galı́ and
Rabanal 2004, Justiniano et al. 2010). The importance of demand disturbances for
fluctuations has also been studied in versions of the search and matching model with
nominal rigidities. For instance, in a calibrated framework, Sveen and Weinke (2008)
argue that monetary policy shocks could matter for unemployment fluctuations. However, in an estimated model Krause, Lopez-Salido, and Lubik (2008) find that these

58

shocks contribute little to aggregate labor market fluctuations. Their results point
instead to variations in unemployment and vacancies driven by markup shocks, which
they interpret as exogenous demand shifters (see also Rotemberg 2006). But, since
these disturbances cause prices and output to move in opposite directions, they can
be alternatively viewed as supply disturbances arising from changes in the marginal
costs of producers that affect desired markups. Gertler, Sala, and Trigari (2008) also
estimate a search and matching model with staggered wage setting and find labor market variations arise predominantly from investment specific disturbances which cause
prices and quantities to move in opposite directions.
In summary, demand disturbances are likely to play at least some role in the variability of both national accounts and labor market data, and it could well be that some
of the shocks here identified as driven by a change in technology would in other frameworks be interpreted as disturbances to aggregate demand.26 Discerning the role of
aggregate demand versus supply shocks in cyclical fluctuations has important normative implications in the design of the appropriate monetary and fiscal policy responses
to shocks. Clearly, allowing for demand-driven business cycles in a framework like ours
is an important area for future research. In our view, to understand the role of aggregate shocks one needs a deeper theory for aggregate demand shifts that departs from
the common practice in the DSGE literature of modeling them as either purely monetary disturbances or as exogenous shocks to preferences. Blanchard, L’Huillier, and
Lorenzoni (2009)aggregate demand fluctuations based on informational frictions. In
their framework it is possible to think about changes in expectations that lead to shifts
in aggregate demand and to plausible variations in aggregate variables. This framework seems to us a really promising way of incorporating demand shocks in models
with search and matching frictions.

26

In Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2010), for example, disturbances isomorphic to our
preference and investment-specific technology shocks act as demand disturbances, inducing a positive comovement between output and prices. Moreover, in their environment, disturbances to the
investment equation (our investment-specific technology shocks) explain the bulk of the business cycle
variance in output.
