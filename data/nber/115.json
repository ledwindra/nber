    "abstract": "\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the production process of optometrists in private practice. This study will then provide further evidence on the entrepreneurial performance of primary health professionals in private practice. If optometrists also appear to be using inefficient production techniques further questions can be raised about organizing the delivery of health services around fee for service, for profit private practices.\n\n",
