                                                 ABSTRACT

We study how the market for innovation affects enforcement of patent rights. Conventional wisdom
associates the gains from trade with comparative advantage in manufacturing or marketing. We show
that these gains imply that patent transactions should increase litigation risk. We identify a new source
of gains from trade, comparative advantage in patent enforcement, and show that transactions driven
by this motive should reduce litigation. Using data on trade and litigation of individually-owned patents
in the U.S., we exploit variation in capital gains tax rates as an instrument to identify the causal effect
of trade on litigation. We find that taxes strongly affect patent transactions, and that reallocation of
patent rights reduces litigation risk on average, but the impact is heterogeneous. We show that patents
with larger potential gains from trade are more likely to change ownership, suggesting that the market
for innovation is efficient, and the impact of trade on litigation depends on characteristics of the transactions.

1        Introduction

The ‘market for innovation’ — the licensing and sale of patents — is an important source of
R&D incentives, especially for small firms and individual inventors for whom patents are often
their critical asset. Transactions in patent rights are also important for developing efficient
market structures in high-technology sectors. They do this by shaping the division of labor,
and the nature of competition, between small firms (or individuals) who typically specialize
in innovation but lack the capacity for large scale development, production and marketing,
and large firms whose comparative advantage lies in the commercialisation of these inventions
(Gans and Stern, 2000; Gans, Hsu and Stern, 2002). The key to realizing these social gains is
efficient technology transfer.
           Despite these private and social benefits, there is growing concern voiced in both acad-
emic and policy debates about the potentially deleterious effects of patent transactions. The
modern innovation landscape             is characterized by a large number of patents, with often fuzzy
boundaries and fragmented ownership (Bessen and Meurer, 2008). The main concern is that,
in this environment, patent transactions can deter innovation if they take place in order to
extract rents through patent litigation, rather than to facilitate welfare enhancing technology
transfers. This issue is at the center of a recent report by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
(2011), and the Supreme Court has raised similar concerns in a recent, prominent case (Mer-
cExchange, L.L.C. v. eBay, Inc., 126 S. Ct. 1837, 2006).1 However, there is sharp disagreement
among economic and legal scholars about the scope and severity of this problem. For example,
Mann (2005) claims that the detrimental effects from patent transactions are minimal, while
Lemley and Shapiro (2007), among others, argue that patent transactions constitute a serious
threat of ex post hold-up for manufacturing firms, discouraging investment and innovation, and
requiring policy intervention in the form of limits to patent enforcement for non-practicing en-
tities.2 Some have even gone so far as to recommend more draconian reductions in permissible
patenting; especially in relation to software patents.3
           Despite the importance of these issues, there are no empirical studies of the impact of

    1
    The FTC report highlights the risk associated with the activity of patent assertion entities (sometimes called
patent trolls), which it defines as firms that obtain nearly all of their patents through acquisitions in order to
assert them against manufacturing companies.
   2
     The policy recommendation by Lemley and Shapiro is to limit the ability of non-practicing entities to obtain
preliminary injunctions — specifically, to allow them only when the patent holder can claim actual lost profits
(which requires that the patent holder to actually be working the patent), but not when only reasonable royalties
are claimed. Other policy proposals are currently being examined by the federal government. For example, the
U.S. House of Representatives is discussing the Saving High-Tech Innovators from Egregious Legal Disputes
(SHIELD) Act (HR 6245), whose objective is to deter patent litigation by patent assertion entities.

the market for patents on patent litigation. Indeed, this lack of empirical evidence led the U.S.
House Judiciary Committee, in April 2011, to amend the Patent Reform bill (H.R. 1249, “The
America Invents Act”) to require the Comptroller General of the United States to study the
impact of patent transactions and litigation on innovation.
       In this paper we take a first step in this direction by studying how the market for patents
affects the enforcement of patent rights. The economics and management literature typically
associates the gains from trade in patent transactions with vertical specialization (Teece, 1986;
Arora, Fosfuri and Gambardella, 2001) and comparative advantages in manufacturing or mar-
keting (Arora and Ceccagnoli, 2006). By raising the potential profit from the innovations, these
mechanisms imply that market reallocation of patent rights should increase the likelihood of
litigation. In this paper we identify a novel source of private, and social, gains from trade —
comparative advantage in patent enforcement. The market for innovation can reduce litigation
if it reallocates patents to entities that are more effective at resolving disputes over these rights
without resorting to the courts.4 A third, more controversial motivation for patent transac-
tions is patent trolling — acquisition of patent rights for later use against existing manufacturing
firms. If this is the driving force behind patent transactions, we would also expect to observe
that a change of ownership raises the likelihood of litigation on the traded patent.
       The main focus of this paper is to identify empirically the causal effect of trade on
litigation, and to assess the relative importance of commercialization and enforcement gains
from trading patent rights (we briefly explore the patent troll issue later in the paper). To do so,
we construct a new, comprehensive data set that matches information on trades (Serrano, 2010)
and litigation (Lanjouw and Schankerman 2001, 2004) involving patents owned by individual
inventors in the United States during the period 1983-2000.
       The empirical challenge in studying how reallocation of patent rights affects litigation is
the endogeneity of patent trading. To address this concern, we exploit a provision in the U.S.
tax law that allows us to use variation in capital gains tax rates across states and over time as
an instrument to identify the causal effect of a change in patent ownership on litigation. Under
U.S. law, for an individual patent-holder the profits from the sale of a patent are taxed as
capital gains, whereas any damage awards from litigation are taxed as ordinary income. This
means that capital gain tax rates affect the incentives to sell patents for individual owners,
but not their incentives to undertake patent litigation, and are thus a suitable instrument for
change in ownership in the patent litigation regression. This identification strategy means that
we can only study patents that are originally owned by individual inventors in this paper.

   4
     This may involve acquisition by firms to accumulate defensive patent portfolios for resolving dispute non-
litigiously (Hall and Ziedonis, 2001) or some form of economies of scale in enforcement (Lanjouw and Schanker-
man, 2004). Defensive patenting is particularly prevalent in high technology sectors where there is widespread
fragmentation of patent rights over important inputs used in the R&D and production processes.


                                                      2
       The main empirical findings in the paper are as follows. First, we show that capital
gains taxation strongly affects the decision to trade patent rights for individual inventors. This
finding is consistent with recent literature on how taxation affects the frequency and timing of
the sale of small businesses (Chari, Golosov, and Tsyvinski, 2005; Gentry, 2010). We conduct
simulations using our parameter estimates that show that changes in capital gains taxation can
have large effects on the frequency of patent transactions and litigation.
       Second, we find that changes in patent ownership reduce the likelihood of litigation for
patents originally owned by individual inventors, on average. This implies that enforcement
gains dominate commercialization gains (and the effects of any patent trolling activity) in the
market for such patents. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that patent transactions
exploit differences across firms in their ability to enforce these rights. However, the marginal
treatment effect of an ownership change is highly heterogeneous and depends on the character-
istics of the patent and the transacting parties. We also show that the market for innovation
appears to be efficient in the sense that patents are more likely to be traded when the estimated
private enforcement gains from doing so are larger.
       Third, we unbundle the heterogeneous treatment effect of patent transactions on litiga-
tion by exploring how specific characteristics of the transaction influence this treatment. We
show that the impact of trade on litigation depends on the size of the buyer’s patent portfolio
and the technological fit of the traded patent in that portfolio. Sales by individual inventors
to other individuals or small firms are not associated with a decline in the (post-trade) proba-
bility of litigation. By contrast, sales to firms with larger patent portfolios significantly reduce
litigation risk. This is consistent with the economies of scale in enforcement first documented
by Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004).5 In addition we find that, holding the buyer’s portfolio
size constant, reallocation of patents increases litigation risk more when the traded patent is
a better technological fit in the buyer’s existing portfolio. This is what we expect since the
potential commercialisation gains from the transfer are likely to be larger in such cases.
       Finally, we examine whether this increase in litigation risk is due to patent assertion
entities — firms that typically gather patents through acquisitions in order to assert them against
manufacturing companies (often referred to as patent trolls). We do not find any evidence that
patent trolls play a substantial role in our sample of transactions involving individually-owned
patents during the period 1983-2000. Whether this conclusion would apply to corporate patent
transactions, or the post-2000 period, is left for future research.
       Taken together, our empirical findings indicate that a well-functioning market for innova-

   5
     Lanjouw and Schankerman (2001, 2004) show that the litigation risk is systematically related to character-
istics of the patent (including measures of value and the technology field) and of the patentholder. In particular,
they find economies of scale in patent enforcement — firms with larger patent portfolios are more able to resolve
disputes without resorting to the courts.

tion is important for allocating patent rights efficiently, and that taxation strongly affects this
process. Moreover, as long as small innovators can appropriate part of the commercialization
and enforcement gains generated by these transfers, this market increases their incentives to
innovate.6
        The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a simple model that highlights
the commercialisation and enforcement gains from trade, the impact of trade on litigation,
and the role of taxation. Section 3 describes the data. In Section 4 we develop the baseline
econometric model for estimating the causal effect of trade on litigation, and present the results.
In Section 5 we allow for heterogenous marginal treatment effects, and empirically link them to
characteristics of the trade. In Section 6 we quantify the impact of taxes on patent trade and
litigation by simulating changes in individual tax rates. Section 7 provides a brief discussion
of the welfare implications of our findings. Brief concluding remarks close the paper.


2       An Illustrative Model of Patent Trade and Litigation

Consider an individual, A, owning a patent and a firm, B, willing to acquire the patent from
the individual.7 If the individual does not sell the patent, he obtains product market profits
from commercializing (licensing or using) the innovation equal to πA . If the patent is acquired
by the firm, it generates product market profits equal to πB . For simplicity, we assume that the
individual has all the bargaining power and extracts the entire surplus from the transaction
(results are similar if there is Nash bargaining).
        Both A and B face an infringing action by a third party, firm C with probability β. If the
infringing action takes place, the patent owner chooses whether to litigate or settle the dispute.
With litigation the patent owner i = {A, B} sustains litigation costs li to secure product market
profits. To settle the dispute, the owner gives up a fraction (1 − θi ) of the profits to firm C.
We also assume that there is a zero mean, random (monetary) component in the settlement
payoff, ε. In this setup, there will be litigation if

                                             πi − li ≥ θ i πi + ε                                          (1)

                                         Pr ε ≤ πi (1 − θi ) − li .

    6
     Our paper is also connected to the growing literature on the interplay between innovation and the transac-
tions across firm boundaries. For example, Azoulay (2004) studies how the nature of knowledge affects outsourc-
ing, Cockburn, MacGarvie and Mueller (2010) examine the impact of the intellectual property (IP) landscape
on licensing and Williams (2011) studies how IP affects cumulative innovation.
    7
      In this paper we do not model the microfoundations of the search process through which matching occurs.
The role of the model is simply to illustrate the two different sources of gains from trade, their impact on
litigation and their interplay with income and capital gains taxes.

      To start, we consider the case in which there are no taxes. If the individual does not
trade the patent, expected profits are

where the term ∆A = (β − Ω πA , eA )(1 − θ A ) captures the expected fraction of profits lost

costs. Similarly, if the patent is owned by firm B, profits are (1 − ∆B ) πB − Ω πB , eB lB
                             
where ∆B = (β − Ω πB , eB )(1 − θB ).

      Condition (2) highlights three possible sources of gains from trade. The first term
captures product market gains, i.e. the greater profits that firm B obtains from selling the
product. The second and third terms capture the enforcement gains which take the form of
losing less profit from settlement, ∆A πA − ∆B πB , and incurring lower expected litigation costs,

      It is straightforward to introduce taxes into the analysis. If the individual owner com-
mercializes the patent, the profits are taxed at the personal income tax rate τ I . If the patent
is traded to the firm, the product market profits are taxed at the corporate income tax rate
τ C . If the individual owner sells the patent, the gains from the transaction are taxed at the
capital gains tax rate τ G . This setup conforms to the U.S. tax code (see Section 4 for more
details). With taxes, we get the following conditions for the decision to litigate and to trade
the patent, respectively:
                                                            

                       (1 − ∆B ) πB − Ω πB , eB lB 1 − τ C 1 − τ G ≥                          (4)

                             (1 − ∆A ) πA − Ω πA , eA lA 1 − τ I


                                                 5
where τ i = τ I if i = A and τ i = τ C if i = B.
       Note that the capital gains tax rate does not enter the first inequality that governs the
litigation decision. The second inequality, however, shows that the condition required to have
trade becomes more stringent with an increase in τ G , an increase in τ C or a decrease in τ I .
Higher capital gains and corporate taxes reduce the likelihood that patent rights are reallocated,
and higher (personal) income tax rates increase it. We test these predictions in the empirical
analysis, and exploit the capital gains tax rate as an instrument for trade based on it being
excluded from the condition for litigation.8
       To see how litigation is affected by a change in patent ownership, let N ewOwner be an
indicator variable equal to one if the patent changes ownership and zero otherwise. If indi-
vidual A does not sell the patent, the probability of litigation is Pr(Litigation|N ewOwner =
              
0) = Ω πA , eA . If trade takes place, the probability is Pr(Litigation|N ewOwner = 1) =
          
Ω π B , eB . Thus the impact of trade on litigation is

               Pr(Litigation|N ewOwner = 1) − Pr(Litigation|N ewOwner = 0) =                               (5)
                                                     
                                 − Ω πA , eA − Ω πB , eB .

This equation shows that the effect of trade on litigation depends on whether it reallocates the
patent to an entity with greater product market gains and/or lower enforcement costs. The
                                                                                        
effect of trade can be either positive or negative, depending on the difference Ω πA , eA −
          
Ω π B , eB .
       Previous literature associates the surplus generated by patent trades with gains from
vertical specialization or comparative advantages in manufacturing or marketing. In our model,
this commercialisation hypothesis corresponds to the case where πA < πB and eA = eB = e.
                 
Because ∂Ω πi , ei /∂π i > 0, in this case the change in patent ownership is unambiguously

associated with an increase in patent litigation, since Ω πB , e − Ω πA , e > 0. Intuitively, in
this scenario trade increases the product market profits generated by the patent but does not
alter the enforcement capability of the owner. Because an increase in patent value increases
the likelihood of patent litigation (Galasso and Schankerman, 2010), trade increases litigation
rates if it is only motivated by product market gains.

      The model assumes that the fee the company pays for the patent is not tax deductible. If we assume that
a fraction g of the fee is deductible, the optimal fee becomes

which depends (negatively) on corporate taxes as long as g < 1. Incomplete deductibility is a plausible
assumption because, under the current tax code, the cost of acquiring intellectual property must be capitalized
(I.R.C. § 263) and are also subject to a variety of tax depreciation rules (Maine and Nguyen, 2010).


                                                      6
In the patent context there are two main reasons why patentees may vary in their likelihood
to enforce the patent without filing a suit. First, patent owners may have different ability
to exchange intellectual property through licensing or cross-licensing agreements (Hall and
Ziedonis, 2001). Second, not all owners may be able to generate an expectation of repeated
interaction large enough to sustain cooperation over time. Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004)
provide evidence in support of these two mechanisms, showing that firms with large patent
portfolios are less likely to file a suit on any individual patent in their portfolio (controlling for
patent characteristics).

Discussion of Modeling Assumptions

There are two assumptions in the model that warrant additional discussion. First, we assumed
that infringement does not occur between the seller and the buyer. However, it is possible that
patent trades occur as the outcome of patent infringement or invalidity disputes. To accom-
modate this, in Appendix 1 we develop an extension to our model that includes the possibility
of infringement between buyer and seller, and we show that our identification strategy still
holds. The intuition behind this is that, also in this extended model, higher capital gains and
corporate taxes reduce the payoff of a patent transaction and thus the likelihood that patent
rights are reallocated, while higher (personal) income tax rates increase it. This extension of
the model, however, introduces an additional mechanism by which the reallocation of patent
ownership reduces litigation. There are now two distinct mechanisms: the first is the differen-
tial ability of the buyer and the seller to settle disputes with third parties (this was the original
channel); the second, new channel is avoidance of litigation between the buyer and the seller
involved in the patent dispute.
      Second, we assumed that the probability of facing an infringing action by a third party,
β, is exogenous and does not depend on the characteristics of the patent owner. Allowing for
different values β A and β B does not affect the main predictions of the model. In particular, we
                                                                                   
can simply redefine Ω πi , ei = β i Pr ε ≤ πi (1 − θi ) − li ) and ∆i = (β i − Ω πi , ei )(1 − θi )
for i ∈ {A, B}, and then there is no change in equations (2), (3) and (4) above. Intuitively,
even if the probability of filing a suit depends on a combination of ex ante, owner-specific
characteristics that affect the likelihood of infringement action, β i , and an ex post random
                                                                          
shock that affects the likelihood of litigation, Pr ε ≤ πi (1 − θi ) − li ) , we can still distinguish
between gains from trade arising from commercialization and enforcement — i.e. , we still get
equation (2). The only difference is that these enforcement gains now consist of an ex ante
and an ex post component. Moreover, our result that the capital gains tax rate does not affect
the individual’s litigation decision directly also holds in this generalized setup. In addition, as
before, the decision to trade is more likely when capital gains and corporate tax rates are low,


                                                  7
and when income tax rates are high (i.e. there is no change in equations (3) and (4)).
       In this generalized setup, equation (5) can now be re-written as:

               Pr(Litigation|N ewOwner = 1) − Pr(Litigation|N ewOwner = 0) =
                                             
                                −β A z A − z B + (β B − β A ) z B
                                      
where z i = Pr ε ≤ π i (1 − θi ) − li ) . This decomposition confirms the result that the effect of
trade on litigation can be positive or negative. As in our baseline model, the difference z A − z B
is positive when ex post enforcement gains dominate product market gains. It also shows that
two types of enforcement gains reduce the level of litigation: 1) litigation declines because of
a greater ability to settle a dispute (the ex post effect, shown in the first term in the equation
when z A > z B ) and 2) litigation declines because of a lower likelihood of infringing action (the
ex ante effect, given by the second term in the equation above when β B < β A ).9


3     Description of the Data and Motivating Evidence
Our starting point is the panel of patents granted in the period 1975-2000 that are either owned
by the original inventor at the grant date or have been assigned to U.S. individuals by the grant
date. Hall, Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2001) refer to the first group of patents as ‘Unassigned’ and
to the second group of patents as ‘U.S. Individuals’ patents. The USPTO refers to both groups
as ‘Individually Owned’ patents. For each of these patents we obtained information on the U.S.
state of the primary (first listed) inventor, their reassignment and litigation history. We also
collected information on the U.S. state and federal ordinary income taxes, capital gain taxes
and corporate taxes during the sample period.
       We now describe the main components of our data set.

       Patent trade data: We follow Serrano (2010) and use re-assignment data to identify
transfers of patents across owners. The source of these data is the USPTO Patent Assign-
ment Database. When a U.S. patent is transferred, an assignment is recorded at the USPTO
acknowledging the change in ownership. A typical re-assignment entry indicates the patent in-
volved, the name of the buyer (assignee), the name of the seller (assignor), the date at which the
re-assignment was recorded at the patent office, and the date at which the private agreement
between the parties was signed. The data set covers the period 1983-2001.

   9
     Endogenising the parameter β is beyond the scope of this paper. Nonetheless, notice that in our baseline
model the infringer gets at most π i (1 − θi ) − li , which is decreasing with the patent owner’s ability to settle
disputes without litigation denoted by θi . Moreover, patent transactions characterized by large enforcement
gains will reallocate the patent to owners with large θ i . Thus, in a generalized version of our model, we would
expect to find that ex ante infringement β i is less likely when ex post enforcement gains are larger.



                                                        8
       Under Section 261 of the U.S. Patent Act, recording the assignment protects the patent
owner against previous unrecorded interests and subsequent assignments. If the patentee does
not record the assignment, subsequent recorded assignments will take priority. For these rea-
sons, patent owners have strong incentives to record assignments and patent attorneys strongly
recommend this practice (Dykeman and Kopko, 2004).
       A challenge in using re-assignment data is to distinguish changes in patents ownership
from other events recorded in the USPTO assignment data. To this end, we use an algorithm
developed in Serrano (2010) that conservatively drops all the assignments that appear not to be
associated with an actual patent trade. Specifically, we drop assignments in which the buyer is
the assignee at the grant date of the patent, and assignments recorded at the patent application
date. We also dropped transfers to financial institutions to eliminate transactions (recorded in
the USPTO Patent Assignment Database) in which a patent is used as collateral.10 Another
concern is that the first assignment of an unassigned patent may not correspond to a trade but
rather to the transfer of ownership from the inventor to the company in which the inventor
works. To deal with this, we drop any transactions where there is evidence that the seller is
an inventor working for the buyer.11

       Litigation data: The patent litigation data set was compiled by Lanjouw and Schanker-
man (2001, 2004). This data set matches litigated patents identified from the Lit-Alert database
with information on the progress or resolution of suits from the court database organized by
the Federal Judicial Center. The data set contains 14,169 patent cases filed during the period
1975-2000. For each of these case filings, the data set reports detailed information on the main
patent litigated, the patentee, the infringer and the court dealing with the case. The data set
contains information on patent cases filed in U.S. federal district courts (and not on appeal).
For each patent in our data, we identify the suits in which the patent was involved and the
year in which the case was filed.12

  10
    We also dropped records in which the buyer and seller are the same entity and in which the execution date is
either before the application date or after patent expiration. For additional details on the procedure, see Serrano
(2010).
  11
     Specifically, for each transfer between a seller i and buyer j ,we identified all the patents which list the seller
i as the (primary) inventor and checked whether any of these patents was assigned to the buyer j at its grant
date. We drop all such transactions.
   12
      The use of re-assignment data as a proxy for activity in the market for innovation can be problematic
because technology can be transferred through patent licensing without changes in ownership. This concern is
less relevant in our study that focuses on patent litigation because typically it is the owner of the patent that
brings patent infringement actions. Non-exclusive licensees do not have the right to sue for patent infringement
(Textile Prods. v. Mead Corp., 134 F.3d 1481, 1485 Fed. Cir. 1998). An exclusive licensee may have standing
to bring such a suit but only under some restrictive contract arrangements (Resonant Sensors Inc. v SRU
Biosystems, Inc., No. 3:08-cv-1978-M).



                                                           9
       Tax data: Information on state and federal income and capital gain taxes are obtained
from the NBER Tax Rates data base. This contains marginal income tax rates by year and
state for a representative household with $500,000 of wage income.13 The data set also reports
maximum federal and state long-term capital gains tax rate by year and state, computed using
the NBER TAXIM model. We obtain information on the maximum federal and state corporate
marginal tax rates, for each year and state, from two government publications: the Significant
Features of Fiscal Federalism (available for the period 1982-1995) (ACIR, 1982-1995) and the
Book of the States (for the period 1996-2000) (CSG, 1996-2000). For each assigned patent in
our data set, we use the ordinary income and capital gains marginal tax rates in the state of
the initial patent assignee. For unassigned patents, we used the state of the primary inventor
as identified by the USPTO. To measure tax rates faced by potential corporate buyers, we
construct a weighted average of state corporate taxes where state weights are determined by
the fraction of state patent applications in the technology class of the patent.14

       Matching data on income and capital gain taxes to patents is meaningful as long as the
patent is owned by an individual at the time of the transaction. To ensure this, we focus
our analysis on the first transfer of a patent. Subsequent owners are generally not individuals
and thus are not subject to either personal income or capital gains taxation on the patent
transaction. Focusing on the first transfer involves dropping very few patent trades. Most of
the traded patents in our data are traded only once (94.9 percent) and only 0.15 percent of
traded patents are traded more than three times.
       The final data set is a panel with 299,356 patents and 2,436,649 patent-age observations.
The main variables used in the empirical analysis are described below.
       Litigation Dummy: dummy variable equal to 1 if at least one suit is filed in a federal
court involving the patent in a given year
       NewOwner: dummy variable equal to 1 for patent-ages in which the patent is no longer
owned by the original individual assignee/inventor
       Income Tax Rate: for each patent-age, the sum of the federal income tax rate and the
state income tax rate for the state of the primary (first listed) inventor of the patent
       Capital Gains Tax Rate: for each patent-age, the sum of the federal capital gain tax
rate and the state capital gain tax rate for the state of the primary (first listed) inventor of the
patent

and the resulting data are available at http://www.nber.org/~taxsim/state-rates/
  14
    All our results are robust to dropping corporate tax rates or to using corporate tax rates in the state of the
inventor, which assumes that trading of patents occurs only within states.



                                                       10
        Corporate Tax Rate: for each patent-age, the sum of the federal corporate tax rate and
a weighted average of the state corporate tax rates. State weights are equal to the fractions of
state patent applications in the technology class (USPTO nclass) of the patent in that calendar
year.

        In principle, exploiting the information contained in the USPTO assignment data it is
possible to recover the patenting activity of the buyers in our sample. Unfortunately, the
names of the buyer and seller in the Patent Assignment Database were never standardized by
the USPTO. Therefore, to back out buyer patent portfolios we need to match each buyer name
manually with a unique assignee identifier required to identify the buyer’s patents. Because of
the large size of our sample (17,605 traded patents), we manually matched only patents that
were both traded and litigated at least once in their lifetime (569 patents). In the empirical
analysis below, we will focus on regression results for the entire data set (299,356 patents), but
also show that the findings also hold for the smaller data set of traded and litigated patents,
where we are able to investigate the role of buyer characteristics on the impact of trade.15
        Table 1 reports summary statistics for the key variables. Panel A shows the fraction of
sample patents involved in trade or litigation at least once in their life. Of the total sample, 4.55
percent of patents are traded and 0.69 percent are involved in at least one suit. These rates are
low but it is worth noting that, for the later patents in the sample, data on trade and litigation
are truncated and this biases downward litigation and trade rates.16 Moreover, patents that
are traded or litigated are much more valuable than the those that are not (as measured by
citations received).17 The striking fact from this table is the strong association between trading
and litigation. Of patents that are traded, 4.2 percent are also litigated; for patents that are
not traded, the litigation rate is only 0.51 percent. Of patents that are litigated, 27.9 percent
are also traded; for patents that are not litigated, only 4.4 percent are traded.
        The second panel of Table 1 illustrates the combined (state plus federal) individual and
corporate tax rates averaged across states for four five-year time periods. There is a substantial
decline in income tax rates in the late eighties and an increase in the early nineties. Conversely,
there is an increase in capital gain tax rates in the late eighties and a decrease in the late nineties.
The summary statistics show the range of variation across U.S. states. The difference between

     In Section 5 we also extend our analysis of the impact of buyer characteristics by using a much larger data
set that includes corporate buyers identified by using a disambiugation algorithm developed by Thoma et. al.
(2010).
  16
    For patents where we have litigation and trade data during the first ten years of life (i.e. patents granted in
1983-1991), we find that 11.8 percent are traded and 2.2 percent are litigated.
  17
    The mean number of citations for patents that are neither traded nor litigated is 6.1. The mean is 10.8 for
traded patents and 16.5 for litigated patents. For those that are both traded and litigated, the average is 19.3.



                                                        11
the lowest and the highest capital gains tax rates across states ranges from 7-9 percentage points
(depending on the year). The difference between the minimum and the maximum income tax
rate across states is 6-16 percentage points. Corporate tax rates decline during the sample
period and the difference between the lowest and highest rates is 12-15 percentage points.18
Analysis of variance shows that 89.4 percent of the overall variance in capital gains tax rates is
variation over time and 8.7 percent is variation across states (the small remainder is residual).
The breakdown for ordinary income tax rates is 92.9 and 6.8 percent; for corporate tax rates,
49.1 and 48.6 percent.
       In Appendix Table A1 we provide a more detailed breakdown of the variation in capital
gain tax rates. For the period 1982-2001, our data show 268 changes in capital gains tax rates
at the state level. The marginal tax rate increases in 138 of these cases and decreases in 130
instances. The average increase in capital gains tax rates is 1.5 percentage points, equivalent
to 54 percent of the rate in the year immediately before the tax change. The average decline
in the capital gains tax rate is 0.6 percentage points, representing about a 9.2 percent tax
cut. The table confirms that there is substantial variation in the rates across time and states.
Only nine states (Florida, Texas, Washington, Tennessee, Nevada, New Hampshire, Wyoming,
Alaska, and South Dakota) do not experience any change in state level capital gain tax rates
during our sample period.
       Individually owned patents represent 17.9 percent of the patents granted in the period
1975-2000 (about 19 percent if weighted by citations received). If we exclude patents granted
to foreign entities and government agencies, individually owned patents account for about 22
percent of the remaining sample. In Table 2 we compare sample means of the number of ci-
tations received for individually owned and corporate patents, granted in the 15 year window
1985-2000 for which we also obtained data on litigation and reassignment of corporate patents.
We distinguish between small corporate innovators (defined following Serrano, 2010) as enti-
ties applying for fewer than 5 patents in a calendar year) and other corporate innovators. On
average, individually owned patents receive fewer citations than corporate patents. Nonethe-
less, if we focus on traded patents, we see only very minor differences in citations across the
three ownership types (this is particularly important because traded patents are key for the
identification of the effect of trade in our fixed effects regressions).19
       Table 2 also examines the differences in the likelihood of trade and litigation. The

  18
    Similar figures are observed if we restrict the analysis to the 20 states with the most individually owned
patents.
  19
    Because these samples are very large, the differences between these means are statistically significant. How-
ever, these differences are small when measured in terms of the percentile of the distributions of citations.
Specifically, the sample means of citations for traded patents owned by individuals (10.34), small corporate
(10.87) and other firms (9.28) all lie between the 77th and the 80th percentiles of the distribution.


                                                       12
fraction of corporate patents that are traded is three times as large as those of individually
owned patents. However, there is essentially no difference between trade rates of individuals and
small firms once we weight patents by citations (this is consistent with the evidence in Serrano,
2010 that show greater evidence of selection into trade for individuals and small firms). For
each of the ownership types we also constructed the annual litigation rates. The litigation rates
for individuals and small innovators are quite similar. At the same time, consistent with the
findings in Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004), there is a substantially lower litigation rate for
larger corporate innovators. Overall, these figures indicate that individually owned patents are
not sharply different from corporate owned patents, especially those of small patenting firms.

Motivating Evidence

Panel A in Table 1 shows that trade and litigation are associated, but it does not reveal how
litigation rates differ before and after a trade occurs. To show this, we focus on patents that
are eventually traded (in our sample period). In Figure 1 we compare the probability of being
involved in at least one suit prior to and after the date at which trade occurs. In aggregate, a
patent that has not been traded but that will be traded in its lifetime is involved in at least one
suit in that year with probability 0.61 percent. A patent that has already changed ownership is
involved in at least one suit with probability 0.48 percent. The post-trade litigation probability
is lower after trade even after we condition on age. For example, a patent that has not yet been
traded at age 7 is involved in at least one dispute with probability 0.76 percent, whereas for
a patent of the same age that has been already traded, the litigation rate is about that level
(0.43 percent). In short, Figure 1 suggests that the reallocation of patent rights is temporally
related to lower litigation risk. In the econometric analysis we exploit capital gains tax rates
as an instrument to pin down the causal relationship.
      The large number of changes in state level capital gains and corporate tax rates that
are present in our data provide potentially rich variation for identification of the tax effect on
trade. Specifically, the mean number of years between two tax changes in a state is about two
years, with 50 percent of the tax changes in a state followed by another tax change in the next
year. Similarly, the average number of years between a tax hike and tax cut is about three
years (on average tax cuts are observed 3.7 years after a tax hike and tax hikes are registered
2.7 years after a tax cut).
      To provide preliminary evidence of the effect of taxes on patent trade, we focus on eight
illustrative tax events (4 tax cuts and 4 tax hikes). Specifically, we searched for tax changes
that were both sizeable (i.e. tax cuts higher than 1 percentage point and tax hikes larger than
2 percentage points, which approximately correspond to the top quartile of the distributions)
and that were not confounded by other capital gains and corporate tax changes within a six


                                                13
year window.20
       We exploit these events to compare the changes in trade rates between individually owned
patents and corporate owned patents, which are used as the control group (since trade for them
is unaffected by capital gains taxes), before and after a tax change. We do this separately for
tax cuts and tax hikes. This leads to the familiar difference-in-differences estimator. In these
regressions we control for additive fixed effects for patent age, years, technology sub-categories
and states, as well as for the level of corporate and income taxes (sum of state and federal
rates). Unreported regressions show that the trading of individually owned patents, relative
to the corporate patent control group, decreases when there is a capital gains tax hike, and
increases with a tax cut, and these effects are strongly statistically significant. The estimated
treatment effects are 0.009 (with std. error equal to 0.002) for a capital gains tax cut and -0.010
(with standard error equal to 0.002) for a tax hike. These effects are large, corresponding to
about 80 percent of the mean probability of trading for individually owned patents.
       Figure 2 depicts the point estimates from a more general empirical specification that
allow the treatment effect to vary for each year before and after the tax event. We normalize
the coefficient to zero for the year preceding the tax event, as is common practice. We also
depict the estimated 95 percent confidence bands. In the first panel, which examines the
effects of cuts in the state capital gains tax rate, we see no statistically significant “treatment
effects” in the years prior to the date of the tax changes. The estimated coefficients are not
individually statistically different from zero (even though the point estimates rise somewhat),
and we also do not reject the hypothesis that they are jointly equal to zero (p-value=0.19).
This result indicates that there is a common trend for individual and corporate patents prior
to the treatment. However, the estimated treatment effects for the two years immediately after
the tax cuts are positive and statistically significant — there is a sharp increase in the relative
trading rate for individually owned patents. The second panel presents the effects of the tax
hikes. While the point estimates of the “treatment effect” decline before the tax increase,
these are not statistically different from zero separately or jointly (p-value=0.25 for the joint
test), but after the tax hike there is a statistically significant decline in the trading rate for

  20
     In our sample, 52 out of 269 events involve a sufficiently large tax change, with 19 tax cuts and 33 tax hikes.
Among these tax events, we can construct a six-year window only for events in the period 1986-1998, which leads
us to 46 tax changes out of 52 (14 tax cuts and 32 tax hikes). Moreover, we focus on capital gains tax events
with no contemporaneous changes of the state-level corporate tax rate in the six year window. This reduces the
number of tax events to 26 (12 tax cuts and 14 tax hikes). Finally, we consider tax events that involve a tax
cut with no confounded tax hike in the six year window, and similarly for tax hikes. This reduces the sample to
eight “clean” tax events (4 tax cuts and 4 tax hikes). These tax cuts take place in Connecticut, Maryland, New
Jersey, and Virginia; the tax hikes in Connecticut, South Carolina, and Wisconsin (in two different years).

4        Estimating the Effect of Trade on Litigation
Baseline Econometric Model

Let Lit denote an indicator variable that is equal to 1 if at age t (period τ ) at least one patent
case is filed involving patent i. We assume that patents are litigated according to the following
linear probability model:
                                      Lit = βXot + µi + λτ + at + uit

where Xot are the characteristics of the owner at age t and uit is the residual component. The
terms µi , λτ and at capture patent fixed effects, period effects and age effects.22
         Letting j denote the initial owner of the patent and k the buyer of the patent, we can
write
                            Xot = (1 − N ewOwnerit )Xj + N ewOwnerit Xk

where N ewOwnerit is a dummy that equals one from the date the patent changes ownership,
and Xj and Xk are owners characteristics that we assume are constant over time for simplicity.
Then the litigation model can be expressed as

                     Lit = βXj + N ewOwnerit β(Xk − Xj ) + µi + λτ + at + uit .                               (6)

         Equation (6) provides useful guidance in interpreting our empirical results. In the next
section we will regress litigation on trade in panel regressions of the form

                               Lit = αN ewOwnerit + $i + λτ + at + uit .                                      (7)

In light of equation (6), the patent fixed effects, $i , will capture the combined effect of the char-
acteristics of the initial owner, βXj , and the patent characteristics, µi (i.e., $i = βXj + µi ) .
More importantly, the coefficient on the traded dummy, α, can be rewritten as β(Xk − Xj ).
This has two implications. First, we can interpret the coefficient on trade as the impact that

    21
    As a robustness check on the difference-in-differences identification strategy, we follow the suggestion of
Angrist and Pishke (2009) to add a time trend interacted with the treated group (individually-owned patents).
This allows for the time trends for the treated and control (corporate owned patents) groups to be different. To
do this, in each of the diff-in-diff regressions we include both an intercept dummy for individually-owned patents
as before and an interactive dummy between individually owned patents and a time trend variable. We find
that the estimated effect of tax changes is robust to the inclusion of the differential trends.
  We also tried an even more flexible specification which allows for an interaction between the dummy for
individually owned patents and a piece-wise linear trend (with the same four sub-periods as used in the paper).
Again the results confirm the estimated effects of tax cuts and hikes on patent trading.
    22
    We cannot include year dummies because the patent grant year is absorbed by the patent fixed effect. We
include dummies for four time periods: before 1986, 1986-90, 1991-95, and after 1995.

the change in ownership characteristics (if unobservable to the econometrician) has on patent
litigation. If we were able to control for all the owner characteristics that affect litigation risk,
the coefficient α should be zero. The second implication is that α will differ from zero only
if two conditions hold: first, there are unobservable owner characteristics that affect litigation
outcomes (i.e., β = 0) and, secondly, the market for innovation reallocates patents to entities
that differ substantially in these characteristics (i.e., Xk = Xj ).23 Previous literature on patent
litigation confirms that owner characteristics substantially affect litigation risk (e.g., Lanjouw
and Schankerman, 2001 and 2004), but there is no existing research on the link between the
reallocation of patent rights and litigation risk. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that
studies this link and the sorting which the market for innovation induces.

Identifying the Causal Effect of Trade on Litigation

To identify the causal effect of trade on litigation, we need to address the potential bias arising
from correlation between N ewOwnerit and uit . This can arise in a variety of ways. A positive
shock to the value of the technology covered by the patent may lead to an increase both in
the likelihood of trade and litigation, inducing positive correlation. Another possibility is that
litigation may increase because firms acquire patents strategically with the purpose of blocking
competitors through patent litigation. Negative correlation can arise if a cash constrained
innovator is more likely to sell its patent and less likely to enforce it aggressively.
       To address potential endogeneity, we need an instrument that affects the likelihood of
trading a patent but does not belong directly in the litigation equation. We exploit a feature
of the U.S. tax code that allows us to use the capital gain tax rates as an instrument. In
the United States Internal Revenue Code, individuals face a lower tax rate on capital gains
(from sales of assets) than on ordinary (‘earned’) income. U.S. corporations do not receive this
preferential tax rate on capital gains (Desai and Gentry, 2004). According to section 1235 of
the Internal Revenue Code, the transfer of a patent by an individual is treated as the sale of a
capital asset and is subject to capital gain taxes. On the other hand, patent litigation damages
(and licensing royalties) are taxed as ordinary income. This treatment of litigation damages is
acknowledged in a number of tax court decisions (Maine and Nguyen, 2003). This means that

  23
     It is easy to extend the model to introduce observable characteristics of the owner. Consider the model
Lit = βXot + γ X   ot + µ + λτ + at + uit where Xot are the unobservable characteristics of the owner at
                          i
             
age t and Xot are the observable characteristics of the owner. Because X        ot are observed, we can estimate
                                  
Lit = αN ewOwnerit + i + γ Xot + λτ + at + uit . In this extended model, the patent fixed effects, i still
captures the combined effect of the time invariant unobservable characteristics of the initial owner, βXj , and
the time invariant patent characteristics, µi (i.e., i = βXj + µi ) . The coefficient on the traded dummy, α,
can be still be rewritten as β(Xk − Xj ) and measures the impact that the change in unobservable ownership
characteristics has on patent litigation. This extension also implies that if the econometrician is able to observe
all the patent characteristics that have an impact on litigation (i. e. Xot is empty) then α would be equal to
zero.


                                                        16
the decision to trade a patent will be affected by the capital gains tax rate, but the decision
to litigate will not. We limit the analysis in this paper to trades of individually owned patents
because this tax distinction does not apply to patent sales by corporations, so unfortunately
we cannot use this instrumental variable for transfers of company owned patents.
        We start by specifying a probit equation that determines how taxes affect the probability
that a patent is traded by the original assignee at age t. To do this, we generate a dummy
variable, T radeit , that equals one only in the year in which the patent changes ownership. We
drop all the observations that follow the first change in ownership and estimate the following
probit regression                                
                                                     0 if p(Zit , Xit ) ≤ εit
                                   T radeit =                                                                        (8)
                                                     1 if p(Zit , Xit ) > εit
where Zit is the capital gains tax rate for individuals in the state of the inventor and Xit is a
vector of patent characteristics and additional controls. Given the probability of being traded
at age t, pit , we can compute the probability that the patent is not owned by the initial owner
at age t as
                                           Pit = Pit−1 + (1 − Pit−1 )pit

with Pi1 = pi1 . Intuitively, the probability of not being owned by the original inventor at age
t is equal to the probability of having changed ownership in the previous periods plus the
probability of not having changed ownership up to age t and being traded at age t.
      Denote the predicted probability from the probit model (8) as pit . We use pit to construct
an estimate of the probability of not having changed ownership up to age t, Pit , for the entire
sample of observations. This estimate satisfies two important properties. First, Pit depends on
capital gain tax rates Zit which are assumed to be uncorrelated with the likelihood of patent
litigation (except through changes in ownership). Specifically, we expect larger capital gain tax
rates to reduce the probability of a change in ownership.24 Second, Pit is equal to expected
value of N ewOwnerit , conditional on the current value and past sequences of Zit and Xit .
These properties allow us to exploit Pit as an instrumental variable to estimate the effect of
trade on litigation (Angrist, 2001; Angrist and Pishke, 2009). Newey (1990) and Wooldridge
(2002) argue that this IV estimator is asymptotically efficient in the class of estimators where
the IVs are functions of Zit and Xit . Moreover, because we are using Pit as an instrument for
N ewOwnerit , the model for Pit does not need to be correctly specified as long as the linear
projection of N ewOwnerit on Pit actually depends on Pit (Wooldrige, 2002).

  24
    Because Pit is a non-linear function of pit , pit−1 , ..., pi1 , it depends on the entire vector of current and
past capital gain taxation rates Z it = (Zi1 , Zi2 , ..., Zit ) . Nonetheless, the relevant thing in our setting is that,
conditional on a patent not having been traded, a change in ownership only depends on Zit .




                                                           17
          In short, we estimate the following 2SLS model. The first stage regression is

                                  N ewOwnerit = β Pit + $i + λτ + at + ξ it

and the second stage is the same as (7) except that N ewOwnerit is replaced by the fitted values
from the first stage


                                            it + $i + λτ + at + uit .
                                 Lit = αN ewOwner                                                              (9)

Empirical Results
Trade and Litigation: Correlations

In Table 3, we begin by presenting OLS estimates of our baseline econometric model (7). The
first three columns present estimates using the full sample (including patents that are not
traded and/or litigated). In column 1, where we do not include any controls, the coefficient on
the NewOwner dummy is positive and significant. However, this result is likely due to selection
into trading, since more valuable patents are both more likely to be traded and litigated.25
In column 2 we include patent fixed effects in the specification to control for this possibility.
This specification makes use only of within-patent litigation variation. Once fixed effects are
included, the coefficient becomes negative and significant, indicating that a patent is less likely
to be involved in a suit after it changes ownership. A Hausman test strongly rejects the null
hypothesis that the patent effects are random.26 The negative correlation between change of
ownership and litigation is robust when we introduce age effects and time period dummies,
in column 3.27         Finally, in column 4 we present a similar regression using the much smaller
subsample of patents that are both traded and litigated at least once in their life. Also in
this smaller sample we find a negative correlation between trading and litigation, but not
statistically significant.28

  25
       A similar positive correlation is found by Chien (2011) in a small random sample of patents granted in 1990.
  26
     To perform the test, we run a random effect panel regression with additional covariates. The additional
controls are the number of citations made by the patent, the number of citations received, the number of claims,
and the technology class of the patent. The random effect coefficient on NewOwner is positive and significant
in the random effect specification (β̂ = 0.003, p − value < 0.01). The estimate from the fixed effect specification
is negative and significant (β̂ = −0.002, p − value < 0.01). We strongly reject that the two estimates are equal
(χ220 = 1878.19, p − value < 0.01).
  27
    In this regression we add dummies for four sub-periods: before 1986, 1986-90, 1991-95, and after 1995. In a
more general specification with a dummy for each year and no age dummies, we do not reject the joint hypothesis
that the individual year coefficients can be summarised by these four period dummies. Results are very similar
if we drop the period dummies and control for only for age and patent fixed effect.
  28
     We observe a similar negative correlation even when we drop the unassigned patents and focus on patents
that are assigned to a US individual at their grant date (14,576 patents). The correlation between trade and



                                                         18
       We also looked at the relationship between trade and litigation for small corporate in-
novators. As for individual inventors, we find a positive (but insignificant) correlation between
trade and litigation when we do not include patent fixed effects, but the correlation becomes
negative once we control for patent fixed effects. The magnitude of the correlation is very simi-
lar to the one estimated for individually owned patents (-0.016 and p<0.01), further suggesting
that the two samples are quite similar.
       The results in Table 3 are to be interpreted as correlations between litigation rates and
changes in ownership, not causal impacts. As we argued above, there are a number of reasons
why we should expect unobservable factors to affect both the trading and litigation decisions.
This intuition is confirmed by a Rivers-Vuong test that provides strong evidence against the
exogeneity of patent trade.29 To address this endogeneity we will now construct an instrument
that relies on the effect of capital gains taxes on patent trading.

Impact of Taxes on Patent Trading

Table 4 presents estimates of the impact of taxes on changes in patent ownership. The de-
pendent variable is an indicator variable, T rade, that equals one only in the year in which
the patent changes ownership. Because tax rates affect the initial owner incentives to sell the
patent up to the time at which the patent is sold, we estimate these regressions dropping all
observations that follow the first change in ownership. In all the regressions we control for a
range of observable patent characteristics, including the number of citations received by the
patent, a measure of the patent generality, technology class (36 two digit sub-categories), plus
year and age fixed effects. Because the main variable of interest (capital gain tax rates) varies
at the state-year level, we report state-level block bootstrapped standard errors (Bertrand et.
al., 2004).30
       Column 1 presents the estimates of the probit model (8). The regression confirms that

litigation is negative and significant at the 5 percent level. The confidence interval of the coefficient on traded
overlaps with the one estimated in the large sample.
  29
    Following Rivers and Vuong (1998), we regressed NewOwner on capital gain taxes, age dummies and period
dummies in a linear probability model with fixed patent effects. We constructed the residuals (v̂) for this model
and then regressed the litigated dummy on NewOwner, age, period dummies and v̂. The coefficient on v̂ is
positive and highly significant (point estimate of 0.054, p − value < 0.01).
  30
     We use the NBER data set for information on the number of citations, grant date and technology class
for each patent. Since citation counts are inherently truncated, we use the truncation-adjusted citations counts
contained in the NBER patent data (Hall et. al., 2001 for details). The NBER data also provides an index
of patent “generality,” defined as one minus the Herfindahl index of the citations received by a patent across
different technology classes. The measure is high if the patent is cited by a wide range of technology fields.
   Our findings are robust to dropping patent citations, generality and including only patent characteristics that
are fixed at the time of issue. Results are also robust to clustering standard errors at the state and state-year
level.



                                                        19
higher capital gains and corporate tax rates reduce the likelihood that patent rights are traded,
and higher income tax rates increase it. These results are consistent with the predictions of
the model presented in Section 2. The estimated marginal effects imply large tax impacts.
The elasticity of the probability of trade with respect to the capital gains tax rate is -1.62.
The corresponding elasticities for the personal income tax rate and corporate tax rate are 1.22
and -0.77, respectively. Column 2 shows that results are similar if we use a linear probability
model.
       As a robustness check, in column 3 we present the estimates for a discrete time, propor-
tional hazard model. This nonlinear model is more demanding in that it is designed to explain
the timing of trade — i.e. the probability of being traded in a year, given that trade has not
yet occurred. Following Jenkins (1998), we estimate a discrete specification of a Weibull pro-
portional hazard model by maximum likelihood method. The parameter estimates from this
hazard model also imply large tax effects on trading: the elasticity of the hazard of trade with
respect to the capital gains tax rate is -1.64. The corresponding elasticities for the personal
income tax rate and corporate tax rate are 1.33 and -0.72, respectively. Finally, in column 4 we
focus on the sub-sample of patents that are litigated and traded at least once in their lifetime.
Despite the huge reduction in sample size, we still find a negative and significant coefficient
for capital gains tax rates. In this restricted sample the estimated coefficients on citations
received and generality are not significant. This is not surprising because all the patents in
this smaller sample are traded, and our time-invariant measures of patent characteristics have
little explanatory power on the timing of trade.
       There is a concern that the impact of taxes on trade may reflect omitted variables
correlated with tax rates rather than incentives to trade generated by the asymmetric tax
treatment of trade and litigation faced by individuals. To check this possibility, in Table 5
we explore the relationship between taxes and corporate patent transfers. Because capital
gains and income tax rates should not affect corporate transfers, the analysis has the natural
interpretation of a placebo test. Moreover, a simple extension of our model to corporate
trades suggests that corporate income taxes should be negatively associated with the transfer
of patents.31
       Ideally, to estimate the effect of taxes on corporate transfers, we would like to use the
effective marginal tax rate relevant to the company decision-making. This is very difficult to
measure because in practice this rate depends on statutory rates, firm income, and dynamic
features of the tax code such as the effects of net operating losses and projections of future

  31
      If the gross profits for the corporate buyer are πB and the seller, by keeping the ownership, obtains gross
profits equal to π S , trade occurs if (1 − τ C )2 π B ≥ (1 − τ C )π S , a condition that is more stringent with larger
τ C . The square on the left hand side of the inequality reflects the fact that the buyer’s willingness to pay is only
his net profit, and the seller then pays corporate income tax on the proceeds of the sale.


                                                          20
income. To proxy this tax rate, we exploit a measure developed by Graham (1996) — essentially
it is a simulated marginal tax rate that approximates the “true” tax variable managers use in
their decisions (Graham provides a detailed description). These tax rates, which vary across
companies and time, have been computed by Graham for essentially all firms listed on Com-
putstat.32 We obtained this simulated marginal tax rate for the period 1980-2010 and matched
it with the sample of large corporate innovators described in Serrano (2010). The final sample
contains 150,511 corporate patents.
       Table 5 reports OLS regressions of corporate transfers against tax rates in this sample.
Because all the patents in the sample are owned by Compustat firms, we were able to include
additional, time-varying controls for employees, cash flow, assets and the portfolio size. We in-
clude firm fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the firm level. The first column shows
a strong negative correlation between the new corporate tax variable and trade. In columns
2-4 we add controls for individual income and capital gain taxes. The coefficient of income and
capital gain taxes are statistically insignificant and have the opposite sign from the coefficients
obtained for individuals in the OLS regression (2) of Table 4. For the estimates in column
2 the elasticities are substantially different than those for individuals. The elasticity of the
probability of trade with respect to the capital gains tax rate is -1.6 and statistically significant
for individually-owned patents (p-value<0.001), but only 0.19 and statistically insignificant for
corporate patents (p-value= 0.94). The large differences in statistical significance, magnitude
and sign of the two elasticities confirm that the strong relationship between capital gain taxes
and patent trade that we uncovered for individual inventors is not present in company-owned
patents.33 In column 3 we show that results are robust to controlling for citations received. In
column 4 we show that results are qualitatively similar when we control for income and capital
gains taxes in the state of the company headquarters, rather than the state of the inventor.
       In Table 6, we move to a stronger specification for trading by individuals that includes
patent fixed effects. Column 1 shows a negative correlation between trade and capital gain
taxes in a panel regression with patent fixed effects as well as controls for patent age and time
period effect. In column 2 we add controls for income and corporate tax rates, and we still
find the key negative (and significant) correlation between trade and capital gain taxes. The
correlations with income and corporate taxes, despite having the sign predicted by our model,

  32
     Graham conducts a variety of validation exercises that show the simulated tax variables outperform alterna-
tive tax measures. For example, Graham and Mills (2008) show that these tax rates do a better job in explaining
financial statement debt ratios than alternative tax measures.
  33
     We also ran a similar probit regression using the entire sample of patents that are assigned to U.S. corpora-
tions by the time they are granted and measuring the corporate tax rate faced by the firm owning the patent,
using the sum of the federal and state top marginal rates for corporates in the state of the inventor. In this
sample, we estimate an elasticity of the probability of trade with respect to the capital gain tax rate equal to
-0.2 for corporate patents, which is substantially different from the one estimated for individual patents.


                                                       21
are no longer statistically significant in this more demanding specification.
       In column 3 we re-run our placebo test in the specification that includes patent fixed
effects. This regression uses the entire sample of corporate patents (not just Compustat firms),
so the corporate tax variable we use here is constructed using the statutory rates. The coefficient
on capital gain taxes is now much smaller and statistically insignificant (p-value =0.99). The
coefficient on the capital gain tax rate for trade of individually owned patents, estimated in
column 2, implies an elasticity of -0.6 (s.e. = 0.1), whereas the estimate for corporate owned
patents in column 3 corresponds to an elasticity of -0.01 (s.e. = 0.28). A formal test rejects the
null hypothesis that the two elasticities are the same (p-value =0.04). In column 4 we present
the placebo test for the sub-set of large patenting firms for which we have the more precise
measure of corporate tax rates described in Graham (1996). The estimated coefficient on the
capital gain tax rate remains statistically insignificant, as does the coefficient on the personal
income tax rate, consistent with the falsification test (moreover, their point estimates have
the opposite sign than those obtained for the analysis of individual inventors). The estimated
coefficient on the corporate tax rate using this preferred measure is negative, as one expects,
and significant at the 10 percent level.34
       Overall, this evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that capital gains, ordinary in-
come and corporate tax rates affect the likelihood that individual patent rights are traded.
Since market based reallocations presumably increase the surplus generated by the patented
innovations, the fact that taxes affect transactions in intangible assets is of independent inter-
est, quite apart from the usefulness of capital gains taxes as an instrument for identifying the
impact of such trade on litigation. Our finding adds to the recent literature that documents
the impact of capital gains taxation on the frequency and timing of small business transfers
involving tangible assets (Chari, Golosov and Tsyvinski, 2005; Gentry, 2010).

Causal Effect of Trade on Litigation

The parameter estimates from the regressions in Table 4 allow us to compute the probability
that a patent is traded at a specific age, pit . The estimate of pit can be used to construct an
estimate of the probability that N ewOwnerit = 1, which we denote by Pit . To estimate the
causal effect of trade on litigation, we use Pit as an instrument for the endogenous variable,
N ewOwnerit . Econometrically, the exogenous variation is derived from the capital gain tax
rates, but any monotonic function of this variable can be used as an instrument and Pit is a

   34
      In unreported fixed effect regressions, we also examined whether variation in corporate tax rates is associated
with variation in litigation of corporate owned patents. We find no statistically significant correlation between
litigation of corporate patents and (statutory) capital gains tax rates in a regression, both in the entire sample
of corporate patents and in the sample of large corporate innovators for which we have the firm-specific data on
marginal corporate tax rates.



                                                         22
typical choice when the endogenous variable is binary (Doyle, 2007; Lileeva and Trefler, 2010).
In all the first stage regressions (reported in Appendix Table A2), Pit is strongly correlated
with the indicator variable N ewOwner, and the F-test of joint exclusion of the instruments
does not indicate problems of weak instruments (p-values <0.01).
      Table 7 presents the parameter estimates using this IV strategy. Column 1 reports
estimates when N ewOwner is instrumented by the Pit , constructed from the probit regression
in column 1 of Table 4. Columns 2 and 3 show that the estimated coefficient is nearly identical if
the instrument is obtained from the linear probability model or the proportional hazard model.
In all regressions the estimated causal effect of a change in ownership on litigation is negative
and significant, and the point estimate (in absolute value) is about six times larger than the
simple OLS estimate in column 3 of Table 3. This result highlights the importance of controlling
for the endogeneity of trade, and indicates a strong positive correlation between N ewOwner
and the disturbance in the litigation equation (inducing an upward bias, in absolute value, if
we treat changes in ownership as exogenous).
       In column 4 we present similar IV regressions using the sub-sample of traded and litigated
patents. In this case too, the estimated coefficient on the change in ownership variable is
negative and significant, and much larger in absolute value than the OLS estimates in Table
3.35
       For the full sample, the IV estimate indicates that a change in ownership reduces the
annual litigation probability by about 1.2 percentage points. In the sub-sample of traded and
litigated patents, the causal effect is an order of magnitude larger, corresponding to a reduction
in litigation probability by about 16 percentage points. While the difference in the magnitude
of the marginal effect across the two samples is very large, the implied elasticities are fairly
similar (i.e., the differences in marginal effects are driven by differences in the mean litigation
probability). Evaluated at sample means, the implied elasticity is -0.43 (std.dev.=0.10) in the
full sample, and -0.91 (std.dev.=0.39) in the restricted sample.36
       The econometric model in equation (9) assumes a constant effect of trade on litigation. It
is tempting to interpret these 2SLS estimates as weighted averages of heterogeneous responses.
However, Angrist and Imbens (1995) show that estimates from constant effect models may
differ substantially from average heterogeneous effects when there are continuous instruments

   35
      There is the concern that spurious correlation may arise between low capital gain taxes and litigation because
of macro-economic variables. To address this concern we exploit U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data on gross
state product per capita (GSP) in 1997 dollars. Controlling for GSP, we obtained results very similar to those
in our baseline specification. GSP itself is not significantly correlated with patent trade or litigation.
  36
     In our empirical setting, these elasticities measure the expected drop in annual litigation rate for a patent
that has not yet been traded. In Section 6, we provide a more complete quantification of the effect of trade on
litigation by simulating changes in individual tax rates.



                                                        23
and covariates. To address this concern, we follow the procedure they suggest and convert
the instrument into a dummy variable. Specifically, we generate the indicator variable Large
T ax Diff erenceit = 1 if the difference between capital gains and income tax rates is above
the 75th percentile of our dataset (19 percentage points). We exploit this binary instrument to
estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE): the average effect of a change of ownership
for those patents whose owners were induced to sell their patents by the substantial difference
between capital gains and income tax rates (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). The average treatment
effect is "local" because not all patent owners are induced by the instrument to sell the patent.
       In column 5 we present the estimates from the Angrist-Imbens procedure.37 The second-
stage LATE estimates indicates that a change in ownership reduces the annual litigation prob-
ability by about 3.3 percentage points. While the magnitude of the effect is larger than the one
obtained in the constant effects model, the confidence intervals of the two coefficients overlap.
Thus, in our setting the estimates of the simple IV model do not differ substantially from the
mean of the heterogeneous responses.
       The estimated LATE measures the effect of trade on the unidentifiable sub-population
of patents that change ownership because of a change in capital gains taxation. Thus it is
difficult to map the coefficients estimated in Table 4 to reductions in litigation rates for the
average patent in our sample. A plausible assumption is to consider those sample patents that
are litigated but not traded as “at risk” of being affected by a change in taxation. For these
patents, the estimated LATE from column 4 implies a reduction in the annual litigation rate
of about 32 percent.38
       Finally, there is the concern that individual inventor mobility may affect our IV estimates.
The first reason is a measurement issue. We measure the capital gains tax rate based on the
state of residence of the inventor. If inventors move before trading (even if the decision to move
is unrelated to the decision to trade), we will get random measurement error in the capital gains
tax rate — we should use the new state of residence but we use the original one. This would
lead to attenuation bias in the coefficient of the capital gains tax rate in the regression of trade
on tax rates. If inventors move to lower capital gains tax states with the intention of trading,

  37
     The LATE is estimated as a two-stage least square regression with the endogenous variable instrumented by
the dummy instrument and interactions between the instrument and covariates. For details on the procedure,
see Angrist and Imbens (1995; Theorem 3) and Lileeva and Trefler (2010).
  38
    Specifically, the average annual probabiliy of litigation among patents that are litigated (but not traded)
at some point in their life is 0.103. Thus the percentage change implied by the estimate LATE is equal to
-0.033/0.103= -0.32. We obtain very similar results using the 90th and 95th percentiles, and the point estimates
are larger than the one obtained using at the 75th percentile. However, while our model suggests that larger
tax differences are likely to generate a larger amount of trade, the actual impact on the average litigation rate
depends on the relative strengths of commercialization and enforcement gains for the patents that are traded
because of the larger tax differences.



                                                       24
this will reinforce the attenuation bias, as we do not measure the lower tax rates (in the new
state) that is relevant. However, while it affects the coefficients in the trade equation, there is
no reason to think that inventor mobility would affect the consistency of our IV estimates. All
that matters for consistency is the orthogonality condition that the disturbance in the litigation
equation is uncorrelated with the relevant capital gains tax rate. If inventors move state to pay
less capital gain taxes on the profits from the sale of the patent; this is unlikely to affect the
new owner incentives to litigate.39


5        Heterogeneous Effects of Trade on Litigation
Estimation and Results

The econometric model developed in the previous section assumes that the treatment effect of
trade on litigation is identical across all patent transactions. However, the underlying motiva-
tion for transactions may vary, with the gains from trade coming from a variety of sources with
different implications for post-trade litigation. Therefore, we now extend the model to allow
for heterogeneous treatment effects as follows:
                                   
                                      0 if Pit ≤ vit and N ewOwnerit−1 = 0
                   N ewOwnerit =
                                      1      otherwise
                  Lit (N ewOwnerit = 1) = αi + $i + λτ + at + uit                                             (10)
                  Lit (N ewOwnerit = 0) = $i + λτ + at + uit

where $i are patent fixed effects, at and λτ are patent age and year effects.40 We assume
that αi can be decomposed into a common component (α) and a random component (ψi ):
αi = α + ψi . The heterogeneous effect of new ownership on litigation is

                      Lit (N ewOwnerit = 1) − Lit (N ewOwnerit = 0) = α + ψi .

         Consider an increase in the value of the technology that makes the patent both more
likely to be traded (small vit ) and more likely to be litigated after trade (high ψ i ). Together
these imply that we should observe a negative correlation between ψi and vit , and thus a

    39
     In any event, cross-state mobility of individual inventors is quite limited, in part because social connections
affect access to finance for small ventures (Sorenson and Stuart, 2001; Breschi and Lissoni, 2009).
    40
    Notice that, conditioning on a patent not having changed ownership (N ewOwnerit−1 = 0), trade occurs if
p(Zit , Xit ) > εit . Multiplying both sides of the inequality by (1 − Pit−1 ) and adding Pit−1 , we obtain

                                        Pit > vit ≡ Pit−1 + (1 − Pit−1 )εit

This is the relationship between NewOwner and P described in the first formula of the econometric model.
Even if the εit are assumed to be independent draws, the impact of vit on NewOwner depends on the entire
sequence of past realizations of εit . The serial correlation in vit is not a problem as long as vit is uncorrelated
with Zit .


                                                        25
negative correlation between vi and the effect of trade on litigation. More formally we should
expect E(α + ψi |vit ) to be decreasing in vit . Because vit is not observed it is not possible to
condition on it. Nonetheless, for an inventor that is just indifferent between trading and not
trading, it must be that P (Zit ) = vit . Exploiting this equality, we obtain the marginal treatment
effect E(α + ψi |P (Zit )), which corresponds to the (heterogenous) effect of trade on litigation
for patents that are traded because of the instrument.
          Heckman and Vytlacil (1999) provide a formal treatment, where they show that
                                                             ∂E(Lit |P )
                                  E(α + ψi |P = vit ) =                  |P =vit                              (11)
                                                               ∂P
and establish identification of the marginal treatment effect. Specifically, the observed litigation
is

      Lit = Lit (N ewOwnerit = 1)N ewOwnerit + Lit (N ewOwnerit = 0)(1 − N ewOwnerit )
           = (α + ψ i )N ewOwnerit + $i + λt + ait + uit .

       The marginal treatment effect (MT E) can be computed by estimating the expected
litigation conditional on P , E(Lit |P ). Let P be our estimate of the probability that a patent
is not owned by the initial inventor. Substituting this into the observed litigation equation, we
obtain a partially linear model

                      E[Lit |Pit ] = E[(α + ψ i )N ewOwnerit |Pit ] + $i + λt + ait .                        (12)

The derivative of (12) can be semi-parametrically and non-parametrically estimated in order to
obtain the marginal treatment effect. For the semi-parametric estimation, we follow Carneiro,
Heckman, and Vytlacil (2010) and approximate E[(α + ψ i )N ewOwnerit |Pit ] with a third order
degree polynomial, obtaining

                        E[Lit |Pit ] = c1 Pit + c2 (Pit )2 + c3 (Pit )3 + $i + λt + ait

which implies a MT E equal to c1 + 2Pit c2 + 3c3 (Pit )2 . For the non-parametric approach, we
follow the multistep procedure developed by Heckman, Ichimura, Smith and Todd (1998) and
Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2010).41
      Figure 3 shows the semi-parametric estimates of the M T E for the entire sample.42 The
horizontal axis depicts the estimated probability that the patent has changed ownership, P.

     41
    For details, see Appendix 2. The first part of the procedure involves estimating the litigation equation
non-parametrically. This is a non-parametric counterpart of the IV estimates and it involves the use of local
linear regressions. The second part of the procedure involves numerically differentiating the estimated E[L|Pit ]
   A simple test of heterogeneity suggested by Carneiro et. al. (2010) involves testing the null hypothesis that
                                                                                               c2 = 
the coefficients of the second and third order are jointly equal to zero. The F -statistic for     c3 = 0 is 24.28
(p < 0.01) in the sample for litigated and traded patents and 13.61 (p < 0.01) in the full sample.
     42
    For the large sample, only the semi-parametric MTE could be estimated because running local linear regres-
sions in a panel with more than two million observations is infeasible with the available computer hardware.


                                                        26
The vertical axis shows the effect of trade on litigation for different values of P (dashed lines
are 95 percent bootstrapped confidence intervals). The support for P goes up to 0.15, which
corresponds to the 99th percentile for the measure. The absolute value of the estimated mar-
ginal treatment effect is monotonically increasing in P . Patents with low value of P are those
that, given their observables, are unlikely to have changed ownership (e.g. patents that are
not highly cited or with low generality index). The small (or insignificant) values of the MT E
in this range show that, if a change in capital gain taxes induced the owner of one of these
patents to sell, the change in litigation risk would be negligible. Conversely, patents with high
P are those at high risk of being traded. For these patents the MT E is negative, indicating a
substantial drop in the likelihood of litigation from transfer of ownership. The MT E becomes
statistically significant for values of P above 0.03 that roughly correspond to the median of the
P distribution.43
     Appendix Figure A1 reports the non-parametric estimates of the MT E for the sub-
sample of patents that are traded and litigated. The support for P differs from the one in the
previous figure because the estimated probability of a change in ownership is greater in the
sample where all patents are traded. Nonetheless, in this case too we find that the absolute
value of the estimated effect is monotonically increasing in P, and statistically significant for
values of P greater than 0.5. The figure looks similar if we estimate the MT E with the
semi-parametric procedure employed for the larger sample.
      These results point to two important conclusions. First, the main impact of trading in
patent rights, over most of the range of P, is to reduce litigation risk, suggesting that compar-
ative advantage in patent enforcement may be more important than comparative advantage
in commercialisation, at least for transfers involving individually owned patents. Second, the
results show that patents with larger estimated (enforcement) gains from trade are in fact those
with the highest predicted likelihood of changing ownership. This suggests that the market for
innovation reallocates patent rights efficiently, at least in this sense.

   43
      Two points should be noted. First, to compare the MTE’s with the 2SLS estimate of the LATE, we split
the distribution of P into seven adjacent bins and computed a weighted average of the MTEs evaluated at the
bin mid-points, with weights equal to the fraction of observations in each bin. The average is equal to -0.013,
which is very close to our 2SLS estimates.
   Second, to assess what fraction of the variation in P is generated by the instrument, we re-estimated the
probability of trade using only variation in capital gains taxes and fixing all other covariates at their sample
means. The resulting distribution is approximately uniform, with a support ranging from zero to 0.08, which
is approximately the 90th percentile of the distribution of P . This confirms that the instrument generates
substantial variation in the predicted change in ownership.

Unbundling the Marginal Treatment Effect
Baseline Analysis

We have shown that the effect of trade on litigation is heterogenous, and that the effect reduces
litigation more strongly for patents at greater risk of being traded. This suggests that the
nature of the transactions varies and that there is a particular type of sorting: patents that
are less likely to be traded (low values of P) are more likely involved in transactions based
on commercialisation advantages, and patents with high values of P are more likely to be in
transactions driven by enforcement gains. To understand this sorting better, in this section
we unbundle the marginal treatment effect and relate it to observable characteristics of the
transaction.
      To do this, we need information on patent buyers. The USPTO reassignment data
contain non-standardized names of the buyers, so buyer characteristics must be manually re-
covered. We perform this manual match for the 569 patents that were both traded and litigated
at least once in their lifetime. For each of these patents, we constructed the size of the portfolio
of the buyer, defined as the number of patents obtained in the twenty years before the trade
occurs. Our matching shows that most transactions involve trade from an individual owner to
a firm (only 11.4 percent of cases involve two individuals). The distribution of buyer portfolio
size is highly skewed. The median portfolio size for acquiring firms is one patent, the 75th
percentile is three, and the mean is 106.1.
      We use the buyer portfolio to construct two variables to capture the two basic motivations
for transactions: enforcement gains and commercialisation (product market) gains. The first
variable, LargeBuyer, is equal to one if the buyer’s portfolio includes at least eight patents
at the time of the transaction (i.e., if the buyer had that number of patents granted in the
preceding twenty years). which corresponds to the top decile of the portfolio size distribution.
Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004) show that firms with large patent portfolios are less likely
to file a suit on any individual patent in their portfolios, controlling for patent characteristics,
and argue that this reflects their ability to resolve disputes ‘cooperatively’ without resorting to
the courts. In addition, larger firms often use broad cross-licensing agreements to avoid costly
litigation and preserve freedom to operate in their R&D activities (Galasso, 2012). Building
on this idea, we expect “enforcement gains” (reduction in litigation) to be greater for patents
acquired by large buyers.
      The second variable is designed to capture transactions where the traded patent is a good
match for the technology profile of the buyer, where comparative advantage in manufacturing
or marketing are more likely to be realized. We define T echF it as a dummy variable equal to
one if the acquired patent belongs to the technology area to which the plurality of the buyer’s



                                                28
patents are assigned. To do this, we use the 36 technology sub-categories defined in Hall et.
al. (2001). The T echF it measure is equal to one for 140 patents (about 25 percent of the
sample). The hypothesis is that in such cases the product market gains from the transaction
will be larger, and thus that such transactions tend to raise, not lower, litigation risk.
       Table 8 presents instrumental variable regressions that examine how buyer portfolio size
and technology fit affect the impact of trade on litigation. Column 1 confirms that patents
traded to small entities, and that fit well in the buyer’s portfolio, experience an increase in
litigation after they are traded. These are transactions where we expect product market gains
to be important and enforcement gains negligible. In sharp contrast, column 2 shows that the
largest reduction in litigation rates occurs when patents are traded to large entities with low fit
in the buyer patent portfolio, where enforcement gains are large and product market gains are
small. Columns 3 and 4 show that trade is associated with a reduction in litigation of smaller
magnitude for transactions where both sources of gains (or none) are present. In column 5
we confirm the results using the pooled sample and interacting the traded indicator with the
dummies for large portfolio and patent fit.44
       These results are consistent with the idea that the market for patents generates efficiency
gains by reallocating patents to large patentees that have an advantage in avoiding patent
disputes and/or litigation arising out of disputes. We can illustrate this mechanism with a
concrete example from our sample. Our data indicate that five individually owned patents
were re-assigned to Sandisk Corporation in 1995. SEC annual report filings show that, during
the period 1989-99, Sandisk signed cross-licensing deals with Intel, Sharp, Hitachi, Samsung,
Silicon Storage Technology and Toshiba. This means that, for the five acquired patents, the
risk of litigation with these companies disappeared once they were re-assigned to Sandisk. For
a more recent example, on July 6, 2012 Facebook announced a patent portfolio cross-licensing
arrangement with Yahoo. Before entering the deal, Facebook acquired a number of patents
from AOL, Microsoft and IBM. Because of the cross-licensing deal, all these patents will face no
litigation risk with Yahoo. More importantly, the widely discussed start-up acquisition strategy
followed by Facebook (Cenicola, 2012) implies that patents initially owned by small innovators
will not be involved in suits with Yahoo, once they are assigned to Facebook.

  44
     The regression in column 5 is a constrained version of those in columns 1-4, where period dummies are the
same across the different samples. In a more general specification, we do not reject the hypothesis that the
period dummies are the same across the four groups of transactions. In column 5 we allow the age dummies to
differ across the samples because the data strongly indicated differences in the impact of these dummies in the
first stage regression.




                                                      29
Robustness of Unbundling Analysis

In Appendix Table A3 we present the unbundling results for a number of alternative specifi-
cations. First, we increase the buyer threshold from 8 to 12 patents. Second, in the baseline
analysis we set T echF it = 1 when the buyer is an individual (in such cases we cannot measure
the portfolio size). Results hold up if we instead set T echF it = 0 in such cases. Third, we
employ a T echF it measure constructed using a finer technology classification (we move from
36 technology sub-categories to about 400 USPTO patent classes). Finally, we use a citations-
based T echF it measure (rather than one based on the patent classification). Specifically, we
define T echF it = 1 if either the acquired patent cites one of the patents of the buyer or if the
patents of the buyer cited the acquired patent. In all these regressions, our baseline unbundling
results are robust: the interaction between the N ewOwner indicator and T echF it is positive
and significant, and the interaction with the LargeBuyer dummy is negative and significant.
These results are consistent with the theoretical framework developed in Section 2, where the
relative magnitude of product market and enforcement gains determine whether a change in
ownership has a positive or negative impact on patent litigation.
      We also examine the possibility that changes in ownership may simply be the way patent
disputes are settled, rather than reflecting an efficient reallocation to entities that are less likely
to resort to courts. There are two reasons why we do not think this case is important in our
analysis. First, it is rare in our sample that trade occurs as the settlement of disputes. To
identify these events, we compared the names of the parties trading a patent with those involved
in the litigation. There is very little overlap: in only 20 patent cases (3.5 percent of the sample of
litigated and traded patents) does a patent transfer follow a suit filed by the same parties. This
fact suggests that the main effect of trade on litigation operates through comparative advantage
in enforcement, and not through facilitating settlement of an existing dispute. Second, the cases
in which trade occurs as the outcome of a settlement are not associated with a larger impact
of trade on litigation, as one would expect if avoiding litigation with the buyer is the main
reason for trade. To check this, we re-estimated the unbundling regression introducing an
interaction for trades occurring as settlement (i.e., where the names of the parties in the trade
and litigation are the same). The point estimate on the interaction is very small and is not
statistically significant. There is essentially no change in the other coefficients.
      There is a concern that the heterogeneous effects that we uncover are peculiar to the
small set of (manually matched) traded and litigated patents and cannot be generalized to the
rest of the sample. To address this important concern, we employed the matching procedure
described in Thoma et al. (2010) in order to standardized the names of patent buyers and




                                                  30
those of USPTO assignees and to match the two datasets.45 The matching is performed by
constructing a matching score (the Jaccard weighted distance) based on the division of name
strings into sequences of characters (‘tokens’). Specifically, the score measure is given by the
ratio between the weighted sum of common tokens in the two names and the weighted sum of
tokens in the two names. Each token has a weight that is inversely related to its frequency
in the dataset. The algorithm classifies patent buyers as “unmatched” if there is no USPTO
assignee name that can be matched to the buyer name with a score above 0.3. If there is at least
one assignee with score above 0.3, the software matches the buyer with the assignee having the
highest matching score. Additional details about the procedure can be found in Thoma et al.
(2010). Exploiting the algorithm, we were able to identify an assignee number for 8,123 of the
13,607 traded patents in our sample (about 59 percent).46
       In Table 9 we use the matching algorithm to extend the heterogeneous effect analysis
to this larger sample. For consistency, in each sample we construct the Large Buyer dummy
to capture the upper decile in the buyer portfolio size distribution of the sample. In column
1 we perform the heterogeneous effects analysis looking at the 2570 traded patents that were
matched with a score of 1. The regression confirms the qualitative results obtained with the
manual matching: the interaction between the NewOwner indicator and TechFit is positive
and significant, and the interaction with the LargeBuyer dummy is negative and significant.
The magnitude of the coefficients is smaller: this is not surprising given that the mean litigation
rate is lower in this larger sample. In columns 2-4 we extend the sample by including patents
matched with lower precision. Column 2 uses matching scores above 0.9, column 3 above 0.5
and column 4 above 0.3. In this last regression, the sample size is 8123 patents, about 14
times larger than the one manually matched. Despite the large differences in sample size, our
main results are robust. Being acquired by a large buyer amplifies the negative effect of trade
on litigation, whereas high fit with the buyer portfolio reduces the negative effect of trade on
litigation.

  45
     In Thoma et al. (2010), name standardization is carried out by developing a dictionary of cleaned names
in the two datasets. For example, the software removes common company words (as INC or AB) and replaces
spelling variations with their harmonized equivalent (as INTL for INTERNATIONAL and its variants).
  46
     Before studying this enlarged sample, we explored the validity of the matching procedure in the smaller
sample of traded and litigated patents for which we can compare the manual matching procedure with the
new automated matching procedure. Of the 569 traded and litigated patents used in the heterogeneous effects
analysis, the software identified a buyer for 368 patents (about 65 percent of the sample). For 124 of these
patents the match had a score equal to 1, and for about half of the matched patents the score was above 0.8.
Roughly 10 percent of the matched patents had a score below 0.4. In unreported regressions we find that in
the small sample we obtain qualitatively similar results if we replace the manually matched buyers with those
matched by the algorithm. We also compare the performance of the regression using the matching algorithm
with one in whihc we randomly select a fictitious buyer. The matching algorithm is informative in the sense
that it performs substantially better than a random matching procedure.




                                                     31
       These unbundling results provide more insight into the pattern of marginal treatment
effects documented in Figures 2 and 3. Our estimates suggest that patents with low values of
P are more likely to be involved in transactions driven by product market gains, and patents
with high P are more likely to be involved in transactions driven by enforcement gains. To
explore this idea further, we look at the types of transactions at each level of P. Controlling
for patent age, our data show that, as P increases, there is a decline in the number of trades to
small buyers with high T echF it, and a corresponding increase in the low T echF it trades. For
example, for patent age 5, about 30 percent of patents in the first quartile of the P distribution
are involved in small buyer/high fit transactions. The fraction drops to 16 percent for patents
in the fourth quartile of the P distribution. Among those patents, the fraction of low fit
trades is about 65 percent in the first quartile, but 82 percent in the fourth quartile of the P
distribution.

Product Market Gains or Patent Trolls?

The unbundling exercise shows a positive association between trade and litigation only for
patents traded to small entities that fit well in the buyer’s portfolio. This finding is consistent
with the model developed in Section 2, where higher litigation rates are generated by product
market gains. A possible alternative explanation for this finding is that the patents in this
sub-sample are acquired by small, specialized patent assertion entities (a.k.a. patent trolls).
       We conduct a series of empirical tests to distinguish between these two competing ex-
planations. Business press, legal studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that trolls tend to
be common in a few industries, specifically those with complex technologies involving many
patented inputs: computers, communication and electronics. We check whether these indus-
tries are over-represented in the high-fit/small-buyer sub-sample by testing whether there are
differences between the technology field composition of these patents and the composition of
the other traded and litigated patents. Mean comparison tests provide no evidence of industry
specialization in the high-fit/small-buyer sub-sample. This result is confirmed by a multino-
mial logit regressions relating the four categories of patent transactions to technology field
dummies.47
       Second, we examine whether the increase in litigation observed in the small-buyer/high-
fit sub-sample is driven by serial buyers. From the USPTO re-assignment data, we retrieve the
number of patents acquired by each buyer in this group of trades during the sample period.

   47
      The fraction of patents in computers and communication (NBER category 2) is 0.11 in the high-fit/small-
buyer sub-sample and 0.09 for the other traded and litigated patents, and the difference is not statistically
significant (p-value=0.52). Similarly, the fraction of patents in electrical and electronics (NBER category 4)
is 0.08 in the high-fit/small-buyer sub-sample and 0.10 for the other patents, and again the difference is not
statistically significant (p-value=0.62).



                                                     32
The distribution is highly skewed (the median and mean numbers of acquired patents are 2
and 9, respectively). We generate a dummy variable capturing serial buyers (the top decile
of the sample). OLS and two-stage least squares regressions where the serial buyer dummy is
interacted with NewOwner show no evidence that the increase in litigation is driven by serial
buyers.48
         Finally, we examine whether the increase in litigation is driven by a few serial litigants.
To do this, we compute the number of patent cases in which each buyer is involved as plaintiff
during the sample period. Of the 116 buyers, 76 are involved in no patent cases, and only five
buyers are involved in more than three cases. OLS and two-stage least squares regressions that
interact the number of cases with NewOwner show no evidence that the increase in litigation
is driven by serial litigants.
         Overall, these exercises suggest that the increase in litigation rates in the high-fit/small-
buyer transactions is more likely to be driven by product market gains than by the activity
of patent trolls. Together with our finding that trade reduces litigation risk for all the other
transaction types, this result indicates that during our sample period trolls do not play a
substantial role in the market for individually owned patents. However, we emphasize that this
finding does not rule out the possibility that trolls are important in the patent marketplace.
The reason is that our data includes only patents owned by individual inventors and covers
the period 1983-2000. It may be that patent assertion entities are more active in the market
for company owned patents. Moreover, while there is documentary evidence of patent trolls
throughout the 20th century (Resis, 2006), their activity may have intensified in the post-2000
period in patent activity has been growing rapidly.49 We plan to investigate these issues in
future research.


6        Simulating Tax Effects on Trading and Litigation
We have shown that capital gains taxes affect patent trading and that these transactions affect
post-trade litigation risk. In this section we use our parameter estimates to simulate the impact
of various tax scenarios on the frequency of patent transactions and litigation.
         Let τ G denote the capital gain tax rate, which we assume is constant for the entire life
of a patent. Let Pt (τ G ) denote the probability that the patent has been traded by age t, L0t

    48
    Similar results are obtained with less restrictive definitions of serial buyers. For example, we generate a
dummy capturing buyers that acquire more patents that those granted to them (77.6 percent of buyers in the
sub-sample) and also in this case, we find no evidence that the increase in litigation is driven by serial buyers.
    49
    There are no econometric studies of the impact of patent trolls on innovation (or even a good measure of
the extent of their activity). A recent attempt to assess the private costs of trolls can be found in Bessen et al.
(2011), who study the stock market reaction to lawsuits by non-practicing entities to compute the lost wealth
to defendants.

be the likelihood of being involved in at least one dispute at age t if the patent is owned by
the initial inventor, and L1t be the likelihood of being involved in at least one dispute at age t
if ownership has changed. Then the expected number of years in which at least one dispute is
filed is
                                        T                             T
                             G                           G
                       E(L(τ )) =            (1 − Pt (τ ))L0t +            Pt (τ G )L1t
                                       t=1                           t=1
                                        T            T
                                   =         L0t +         Pt (τ G )(L0t − L1t ).
                                       t=1           t=1

        The estimates in Tables 4 and 7 can be used to compute E(L(τ G )) for the average patent
in our sample. We measure L0t as the predicted litigation probability for a patent of age t that
has not changed ownership, using column 1 from Table 7.                   L0t − L1t is computed with the
IV estimate in the first column of Table 7.       Pt (τ G ) is the predicted probability of trade for
different levels of capital gain taxes τ G , constructed using the estimates in column 1 from Table
4, and evaluated at sample means.
        We compute E(L(τ G )) for different tax scenarios. In the baseline scenario we assume
τ G = 29.2 (percent), which is the average value in our sample and similar to the combined
(state plus federal) tax rate faced by an individual in Texas in 1995. In the second, low tax
scenario we set τ G = 20, which is the lowest rate in our sample and is the combined rate faced
in Florida in 1985. In the third, high tax scenario τ G = 40, which is close to the highest rate
in our sample, which prevailed in California in 1997. In the last two scenarios we study the
impact of removing the differential tax treatment of capital gains. First, we increase the capital
gains rate to be equal to the (personal) income tax rate. Second, we equate the two rates at
the lower, capital gains rate. In all these exercises, corporate tax rates are kept at their sample
mean.
        Table 10 summarizes the results. In the baseline scenario E(L(τ )) is 0.013. Multiplying
this number by the average number of disputes filed in each year in which the patent is litigated
(1.2 in our sample) and adjusting for litigation under-reporting using the weights in Lanjouw
and Schankerman (2001), we can translate E(L(τ )) into a number of predicted disputes. Our
computations predicts about 36 disputes every 1,000 patents. This estimate, computed using
an entirely independent method, is very similar to the litigation level estimated in Lanjouw
and Schankerman (2001), which for individuals is 35 disputes per 1,000 patents.
        In the low tax scenario — representing a reduction in the capital gains rate by 9.2 per-
centage points — the number of traded patents nearly doubles and this generates a 36 percent
reduction in the number of disputes (to about 23 per 1,000 patents). In the high tax scenario —
an increase in the capital gains rate by 11 percentage points — there is a 45 percent reduction in
the number of traded patents with an associated 22 percent increase in the number of disputes.

                                                  34
Equalizing capital gains and income tax rates is associated with a contraction in the frequency
of trade and an increase in litigation. The magnitude of the effect depends on whether the
equality is reached by an increase in capital gains rate or a reduction in the income tax rate.
The increase in litigation rates is stronger when capital gains rates are increased to the aver-
age level of income rates in our sample (42.6 percent). These computation exercises confirm
that capital gains taxes have a powerful impact on the market for patents, and thereby on the
litigation risk associated with the enforcement of those patent rights.


7    Discussion of Welfare Implications
We have shown that patent transactions are strongly affected by tax policy, and that this
reallocation reduces the litigation risk after trade, on average, though there is heterogeneity
in the effects of trade which depends on the characteristics of the patent and the transacting
parties. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that patent transactions effectively
exploit differences across firms in their ability to enforce these rights. But the broader policy
question motivating the analysis in this paper is whether patent transactions increase total
social welfare. To shed light on this question, we first briefly discuss the different ways in
which the market for patents can affect welfare and then identify how our empirical findings
contribute to this broader welfare assessment.
      The market for patents can generate welfare gains of three main types. First, patent
transactions facilitate the reallocation of innovations to firms that are more efficient in com-
mercializing patented innovation. These gains from trade arise from differences across firms
in their access to complementary assets, vertical specialization, and comparative advantages in
development, manufacturing and marketing of innovations. Such patent transactions generate
both private benefits and social welfare through lower commercialization costs (Teece, 1986;
Arora, Fosfuri and Gambardella, 2001). In addition, these transactions promote the emergence
of efficient market structures in dynamic, high-technology sectors. In particular, they facilitate
a more efficient division of labor in innovation activity between small firms (or individuals)
who specialize in early stage innovation and large firms whose comparative advantage lies in
the later development and commercialisation of these inventions (Gans and Stern, 2000; Gans,
Hsu and Stern, 2002).
      Second, as we show in this paper, patent transactions can generate welfare gains by
exploiting comparative advantages in patent enforcement. This occurs when the market for
innovation reallocates patents to entities that are more effective at resolving disputes over
these rights without resorting to the courts, which reduces litigation costs associated with
disputes.
      Third, the two channels above — which relate to ex-post commercialization and enforce-

                                                 35
ment of innovations — also increase the ex ante incentives for R&D investment, especially for
individuals and small firms, as long as the gains from trade are shared by the inventors. Given
that innovation is the main engine of economic growth, and the consensus among economists,
beginning with Arrow (1962), that the positive externalities from R&D imply under-investment
relative to the socially optimal level, we expect this indirect increase in ex ante incentives for
R&D to enhance social welfare.50
       Despite these social benefits, patent transactions may also generate social costs. The
modern patent landscape is characterized by a large number of patents, with fuzzy boundaries
and fragmented ownership (Bessen and Meurer, 2008). A number of scholars have argued that
this environment enables patent holders to obtain excessive royalties by holding up infringers
after they have already invested heavily to design, manufacture, market, and sell the product
with the allegedly infringing feature (Shapiro, 2001). Such ex post hold-up may impose an
‘innovation tax’ which reduces the ex post profits of innovators who use the patent by more
than would have been the case if the parties would have contracted ex ante before the sunk
investment was made. This implies that ex post hold-up leads to greater dilution of the ex
ante incentives of the patent user to undertake capital investments and R&D in the first place.
Of course, this argument is not as clear-cut as it is sometimes presented because patent trolls
increase the returns to the patents that they acquire which, if shared by the original inventor in
the patent transaction, also enhances the R&D incentives of those inventors.51 Finally, patent
transactions can reduce consumer welfare if patent accumulation, or concentration of patent
ownership, leads to an increase in market power.
       What our empirical analysis does is to provide new, causal evidence on the functioning of
the market for patents, in particular by identifying a previously unnoticed source of gains from
trade — comparative advantage in the enforcement of patent rights — and showing that this is an
empirically important consequence of the observed patent transactions by individual inventors.
We also show that the market for innovation appears to be efficient in the sense that patents are
more likely to be traded when the estimated private enforcement gains from doing so are larger.
From a welfare perspective, our findings imply that the market for innovation reduces litigation

  50
     In a recent paper, Bloom, Schankerman and Van Reenen (2012) show that, when R&D generates ‘business
stealing’ effects that dominate technology spillovers, the conventional wisdom that there is under-investment in
R&D can be overturned. Nonetheless, their empirical analysis shows that there is under-investment in R&D,
with the social return roughly twice the private rate.
  51
    Theoretical analysis of trolling activity is very limited (Turner, 2011 is an exception). It is not clear to
us whether, in a dynamic contest, excessive hold up can be sustainable because it reduces R&D and thus
the opportunities for future rent extractions. At a minimum, we would expect this dynamic link between
rent extraction and R&D must limit the scope for profitable hold-up. In addition, the degree of ownership
fragmentation, and the limits to ex ante contracting for serial trolls whose identity would be known by potentially
investing parties, may play an important role in such a context. We leave these important issues for future
research.


                                                        36
by reallocating patents to entities that are more effective at resolving disputes over these rights
without resorting to the courts, and this represents a source of both private benefits and social
welfare gains. In short, our analysis characterizes and quantifies the enforcement gains from
trade from the market for patents, measured in terms of reduction in litigation risk. This is
an important part of the benefit side of the welfare assessment, but it does not encompass the
potential cost of a more fluid market for patent transactions.
      As described in Section 5, we conducted a number of empirical exercises to investigate
the role of patent trolls in our assessment of patent trading and litigation. While we found that,
during our sample period, trolls do not play a substantial role in the market for individually
owned patents, we stress that a verdict on the extent and impact of trolls is premature. Our
data only covers patents owned by individual inventors and their trade history during the period
1983-2000. It is possible that trolls are more active in the market for company owned patents,
and that their activity may have intensified in the post-2000 period. If this turns out to be the
case, the results in our paper are still important because they show that the market for patent
rights generates real and substantial private, and social, benefits. In doing so, these results
show the importance of designing remedial policies that directly target non-practicing entities
and hold-up behavior (such as those recommended by Lemley and Shapiro, 2007), rather than
adopting policies that broadly restrict the level of patent transactions.


8    Conclusions
In this paper we study how the market for patents affects the enforcement of patent rights.
Conventional wisdom associates the reallocation of patent rights through trade with compara-
tive advantages in commercializing the innovation. The associated product market gains from
trade should increase litigation risk for traded patents. We identify a new source of gains from
trade, comparative advantage in patent enforcement, and show that this mechanism reduces
patent litigation. Using data on trade and litigation of individually owned patents, and exploit-
ing variation in capital gains tax rates across states and over time as an instrumental variable,
we identify the causal effect of changes in patent ownership on litigation rates.
      There are three key empirical findings. First, capital gains taxes strongly affect market
transactions in patent rights for individual inventors. Second, the reallocation of these patent
rights reduces litigation risk for individually owned patents, on average, indicating that en-
forcement gains are more important than product market gains for such patents. Third, the
marginal treatment effect of trade on litigation is heterogeneous. Patents with larger potential
gains from trading are those with the highest estimated probability of changing ownership,
suggesting that market reallocates patent rights efficiently. Moreover, the impact of trade is
related to transaction characteristics — specifically, the size of the buyer’s patent portfolio and

                                                37
the technological fit of the patent in that portfolio. Finally, we find no evidence that patent
trolls play a significant role in our sample, but whether this conclusion also holds for corporate
patent transactions, or the last decade, remains an open question.
      The findings in this paper demonstrate that a well-functioning market for innovation is
important for allocating patent rights efficiently ex post, and that taxation affects this process.
As long as small innovators can appropriate part of the gains from patent trading, this market
also increases their ex ante incentives to innovate.

Notes: Our sample includes all patents granted to U.S. individuals and corporations for the period 1985-2000. Patent Citations
Received: Mean number of the truncation-adjusted forward cites (see Hall et al., 2001). The trade rate is the proportion of patents
that were traded at least once in the sample. The trade weighted by cites is a sample mean computed assigning weights to
patents based on their number of patent citations received. The annual litigation rate is the predicted probability that a patent
will be involved in litigation in a given year. This probability was obtained using the coefficients of a Probit model of the
decision to litigate a patent controlling for age dummies, technology dummies, year dummies, and individual and type of
innovator dummies. patent, and evaluated at the sample means of the covariates. Technology dummies represent the 36
technology sub-categories defined in Hall et al. (2001). Small Firms are those with five of fewer patents in a given year (see
Serrano, 2010 for details). All Other Innovator is the residual category.

NOTES: All regressions include age, period and patent fixed effects. Standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the patent level. Statistical significance: * 10
percent, ** 5 percent, *** 1 percent. Litigation Dummy = 1 if the patent is involved in at least one case at that age; NewOwner = 1 when the patent changes
ownership for the first time and remains equal to one for the remaining life of the patent. Time Period Dummies: before 1986, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, after 1995.
P ? is the estimated probability of not being owned by the original inventor. Large Tax Difference Dummy =1 if difference between income tax rates and capital gain
tax rates is above the 75th percentile.

NOTES: These figures plot coefficient estimates (and 95 percent confidence intervals) from the diff-in-diff analysis
described in Section 3. The x-axis plots years relative to a tax change (being zero the year of the tax change). The
coefficients are estimates from OLS regressions with patent age effects, calendar year effects, technology sub-
categories effects, an individually owned patent dummy, a dummy indicating whether a patent is subject to
renewal fees, a set of U.S. state dummies, the level of corporate and income taxes (sum of state and federal rates),
and a set of dummy variables for the length of the lag before and after the tax change (the year prior to the tax
change is taken as the reference year). The standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity. The dependent
variable is whether or not a patent was traded in a given year, and the unit of analysis is patent-year.

Appendix 1: Extended Model with Infringing Buyer

In this appendix we extend the model developed in Section 2 by allowing the buyer to be a
potential infriger.   The individual, A, owns the patent and a firm, B, is willing to acquire
the patent from the individual. If the individual does not sell the patent, he may obtain
product market profits equal to π A . If the patent is acquired by the firm, it generates product
market profits equal to πB . Both A and B may face an infringing action by a third party, firm
C. The infringement action occurs with probability β. If the infringing action takes place, the
patent owner chooses whether to litigate or settle the dispute. With litigation the patent owner
i = {A, B} sustains litigation costs Li to secure product market profits. To settle the owner
gives up a fraction (1 − θiC ) of the profits to firm C. There will be litigation if

                                       πi − Li ≥ θiC πi + ε

that occurs with probability
                                                            
                                    Pr ε ≤ πi (1 − θiC ) − Li .

At the time of the negotiation, firm B may also be potentially infringing the patent. To capture
this possibility, we assume that a dispute between the two parties arises with probability ρ.
Settlement of the dispute with B involves a loss of a fraction of profits equal to (1 − θAB ).
      We refer to the vector eiC = (Li , θ iC ) as the "enforcement" vector of owner i = {A, B}.
                                                                                               
Litigation between i and C takes place with probability Ω πi , eiC = β Pr ε ≤ πi (1 − θiC ) − Li ) .
We define eAB = (LA , θAB ) and indicate with Ω(πA , eAB ) the probability that litigation is ob-
served between A and B. In this extended setting,trade between A and B occurs if the following
condition is satisfied:
                                                            
                      (1 − ∆BC ) πB − Ω πB , eBC LB 1 − τ C 1 − τ G ≥
                                                                         
           (1 − ∆AB − ∆AC − ∆ABC ) πA − (Ω πA , eAC + Ω(πA , eAB ))LA 1 − τ I

where ∆AB is the fraction of profits that are expected to be lost in the event of settlement
between A and B (but not C) and ∆ABC is the fraction lost if A settles with both parties. This
inequality shows that also in this extended model the condition required to have trade becomes
less stringent with an increase in τ I and a decrease in τ G .
      We now investigate how the level of litigation is affected by a change in patent ownership.
If individual A does not sell the patent, the expected number of suits in which the patent is
                                                                   
involved is equal to E(Litigation|T = 0) = Ω(πA , eAB ) + Ω πA , eAC . If trade takes place the
                                                            
expected number of suits is E(Litigation|T = 1)=Ω πB , eBC . Therefore:

                          E(Litigation|T=1) − E(Litigation|T=0) =                             (1)
                                                           
                         −Ω πA , eAB − (Ω πA , eAC − Ω πB , eBC .                             (2)


                                                 1
Formula (1) shows how changes in patent ownership affect litigation rates through two different
channels. First, as in the baseline model trade reallocates the patent to an entity that has
a different likelihood to resort to courts. This "reallocation effect" is positive or negative
                                                  
depending on the difference Ω πA , eAC − Ω πB , eBC that in turns depends on magnitude of
the "product market" and the "enforcement gains". Second, in this extended model by trading
with the firm the individual substitutes litigation with trade. This "replacement" effect is
                                
captured by the term −Ω πA , eAB that is always negative.


Appendix 2: Details on Non-Parametric Estimation

This section describes the details of the non-parametric estimation of the marginal treatment
effect. Our approach is based on a multistep, non-parametric procedure of Heckman, Ichimura,
Smith and Todd (1998) and Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil (2010). We extend their proce-
dure to a panel data setting in order to account for individual/patent fixed effects.
       The first part of the procedure involves estimating the litigation equation non-parametrically.
This is a non-parametric counterpart of the IV estimates in Table 4.

  1. STEP 1. Regress each of the variables in the vector of covariates X on P using local
       linear regression. In our setting this involves running multiple regressions. In particular,
       we run a regression for each age dummy on P , a regression for each calendar dummy on
       P, and finally another regression of income tax rates on P. The regressions were run in
       STATA 10 using the command lpoly.

  2. STEP 2. Let 
                 εX be the residuals and vector of residuals from the regression in step 1.
       Regress L on 
                    εX using OLS with patent fixed effects in order to obtain an estimate of
       the vector β 0 .

  3. STEP 3. Let  ε be an estimate of the residual from the previous OLS regression (account-
     ing for the patent fixed effects). This is an estimate of β 1 P + E[(α + ψ i )T |P]. Regressing
       ε on P using local linear regression allow us to obtain a non-parametric estimate of 
                                                                                            ε(P).
                                                                                0 X + µ
       Putting all this together, we construct an estimate of E[L|P], E[L|P] = β           ε(P).
                                                                                         i +
                                                                                
       The second part of the procedure involves numerically differentiating E[L|   P]. To do so,
we divide observations into groups, based either on the deciles of the distribution of P or
the absolute value of P. Recall that the variable component of E[L|  P ] with respect to P
   ε(P ). The mean of 
is                    ε(P) was calculated for each of these groups. The derivative of ε(P )
were obtained by finite differencing across neighboring groups. The confident intervals of the
marginal treatment effects were obtained using 50 bootstrap iterations (seed = 123 in STATA
10).

NOTE: Capital gains tax rates for the period 1982-2001 are obtained from the NBER TAXIM dataset. Changes in Tax
Rates is equal to the number of policy changes in the capital gains tax rate for the period 1982-2001. Tax changes is
equal to the average tax change in percentage points (or growth rates) among all the changes in the capital gains tax
rate in a State. US states with zero tax changes in the state level capital gains tax rate are states with no state level
capital gains tax rate (e.g., Florida). The row labeled "Average" is the average across US states. U.S. States are ranked
according to the number of individually-owned patents granted in the state.

NOTES: All regressions include age , period and patent fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are
clustered at the patent level. Statistical significance: * 10 percent, ** 5 percent, *** 1 percent. NewOwner
= 1 when the patent changes ownership for the first time and remains equal to one for the remaining life
of the patent. Time Period Dummies: before 1986, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, after 1995. P^ is the estimated
probability of not being owned by the original inventor.
