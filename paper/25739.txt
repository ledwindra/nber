The Return to Hours Worked Within and Across Occupations: Implications for the Gender
Wage Gap

ABSTRACT
We document two empirical phenomena. First, the observational wage returns to hours worked
within occupation is small, and even negative in some specifications. Second, the wage return to
average hours worked across occupations is large. We develop a conceptual framework that
reconciles these facts, where the key insight is that workers choose jobs as a bundle of
compensation and expected hours worked. As an example, we apply this framework to the gender
wage gap and show how it can explain the view expressed in recent work that hours differences
between men and women represent a large and growing component of the gender wage gap.

1. Introduction
Employed women work, on average, three to five hours fewer than employed men, even
controlling for demographics and occupation. 1 A recent literature, including Bertrand et al.
(2010), Gicheva (2013), Cha and Weeden (2014), Goldin (2014), Goldin and Katz (2016), and
Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming), has argued these gender differences in hours worked and
preferences for job flexibility are crucial to understanding the gender pay gap. 2 In order for hours
worked to have a significant bearing on the gender wage gap, it must be the case that the wage
return to hours worked is meaningful. While prior research has documented significant
heterogeneity in the income elasticity of hours worked across occupations, the average estimated
income elasticity is close to unity. 3 This implies that the wage-hours elasticity is close to zero
and thus incapable of explaining, in an accounting sense, a substantial fraction of the gender
wage gap across all workers.
Consequently, we carefully examine the relationship between weekly hours worked and
wages. We show that weekly hours worked is not strongly associated with higher wages within
occupations. 4 Using individual data from the 2016 ACS, we find that a 10% increase in hours is
associated with 1% lower hourly wages. 5 Even accounting for measurement error, wages tend to
be only weakly related to hours worked. In contrast, we show that across occupations, there is a
large, positive relationship between occupation-level average hours worked and occupation-level
average wages. Again, using the 2016 ACS, we estimate a 10% increase in the average hours

worked in an occupation is associated with a 20.3% increase in average wages in the
occupation. 6
To reconcile the differences in returns to hours within and across occupations, we
propose a simple framework relating hours worked and compensation. We envision a job as an
employment contract where compensation is a function of both expected hours worked and
actual hours worked. We allow the relationship between compensation and expected hours to be
different than the relationship between compensation and actual hours.
A natural example of such a difference is found in salaried jobs, where the compensation
implicitly depends on the amount of work to be done (expected hours), but at the margin, wages
will have a negative relationship with actual hours worked. In jobs paid at hourly rates, the
relationship between hours worked and wages is naturally small, though may be larger than zero
when accounting for the possibility of overtime work. However, at the occupation level,
compensation for wage workers can increase with occupation level hours worked, as workers
who commit to more expected hours may receive a wage premium.
It may be the case that even gender differences in hours within occupation may be due to
differences in expected as opposed to actual hours. This is consistent with Cortes and Pan
(Forthcoming), who conjecture that the large pay gains associated with closing gender hours
gaps suggests that relaxing hours constraints on women “enabled [them] to enter a different
job… within the same occupation” and that “shifts in women’s position in the males’ earnings
distribution are unlikely to occur if women simply worked more hours and stayed in the same
job.” It is also consistent with the findings of Hirsch (2005) who finds, using a person fixed
effects design, that the wage losses associated with part time work largely disappear when one

controls for industry, occupation, and task measures. If the difference in hours worked by men
and women within occupation is largely driven by differences in expected hours worked across
jobs, then pricing male-female hours differences may be best accomplished using the
occupation-level relationship between wages and hours. 7
Empirically, we find that if we account for gender differences in hours using the price
implied by a regression of wages on individual level hours, this actually widens the residual
gender wage gap, as increased hours are associated with lower wages. In contrast, if we price
hours based on the cross-occupation wage-hours relationship, even controlling for occupation
task characteristics, the residual wage gap drops by half. If we perform the same exercise, but do
not control for occupation level task characteristics, the residual gender wage gap closes almost
entirely. These pricing exercises indicate that, as argued in prior literature, hours worked may
play a critical role in accounting for the gender wage gap, and the degree to which this is
important depends on the nature of hours differences between men and women.
We also document that the relationship between hours worked and wages has been
increasing over time both at the individual and occupational level. Given the gender gap in
hours, this finding suggests that women have been swimming upstream in terms of achieving
wage-parity with men. When pricing gender differences in hours at the individual level from
1980 to 2016, these changing returns to hours worked exacerbate the gender wage gap by nearly
20%, similar to the conclusions of Cha and Weeden (2014). However, when we use the
occupational-level relationship between hours and wages to price gender hour differences, our
estimates imply that the gender wage gap would be as much as 46% lower if returns to hours

7

Supporting evidence for this is found in Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming), who find that when hours constraints on
women are relaxed, this results in different occupational choices and not simply more hours worked within an
occupation.

worked had remained at 1980 levels. Thus, even as the educational attainment of women has
surpassed that of men and they have been increasingly employed in higher wage occupations,
this increasing returns to hours worked has worked against wage-parity.
We view our paper as complementary to the existing literature on the role of hours in
explaining gender gaps in compensation. 8 Much of this literature has documented important
heterogeneity in the returns to hours worked across occupations, such as Bertrand et al. (2010),
Goldin (2014), and Goldin and Katz (2016), who show much higher returns to working longer
hours in law and business occupations than occupations such as pharmacists, and
correspondingly larger gender wage gaps. We focus on the average level of the gender wage gap
and returns to hours worked for all workers and not the variation in gaps and returns across
occupations. Our analysis demonstrates that the returns to expected hours worked may be higher
on average than previously believed, suggesting an important role for hours worked in mediating
the gender wage gap.
By examining the relationship between wages and hours, it is natural to question how our
paper relates to the voluminous literature on labor supply. Historically, this literature has
typically assumed that workers can choose their hours in response to wages. However, in many
settings workers do not have complete discretion over hours worked which complicates
interpretation of the relationship between wages and hours worked. 9 In particular, Altonji and
Paxson (1988, 1992) focus on changes in hours and wages among job switchers, arguing that job
switching is a primary channel for workers to adjust their hours of work and associated

8

We acknowledge that other job characteristics beyond hours are important in thinking about the gender wage gap.
For example, a job with relatively low hours but rigid requirements about scheduling may be disproportionately
unappealing to women. We abstract from them in the current paper as is common in this literature (Goldin (2014),
Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming), Cha and Weeden (2014)).
9
In some atypical settings it is quite plausible that workers can adjust hours such as stadium vendors (Oettinger
1999) or taxi cab drivers (Farber 2015).

compensation. More recently, Chetty et al. (2011) study labor supply decisions in a framework
where firms set hours constraints on workers and thus changes in hours worked induced by wage
changes for individuals typically come when switching jobs. Our analysis of the crossoccupation wage-hours relationship is consistent with these studies, suggesting that choices
across jobs and occupations are crucial to individuals’ labor supply decisions.
We continue our analysis by describing a set of empirical facts regarding the relationship
between hours worked and wages. We then sketch a theoretical framework to rationalize these
facts. We finish by relating our empirical findings and theoretical insights to the gender wage
gap.

2. Empirical Facts
We begin this part of the analysis by establishing three facts. First, the relationship
between hours worked and wages at the individual level is consistently small. Second, the
relationship between hours worked and wages at the occupation level is substantively larger.
Third, since 1980, the occupation-level relationship between hours worked and wages has
grown.
We use individual-level data on hours worked and income from the Current Population
Survey, the Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). We focus on the civilian noninstitutionalized population of workers between ages 25 and 55. We drop observations with
missing occupation data, as well as individuals who are self-employed. Our primary measure of
weekly hours worked is given by an individual’s reported usual weekly hours worked for the
prior year. Hourly wages are computed by dividing total reported wage and salary income for
the prior year by the product of usual hours worked and weeks worked in the previous year.

6

Where incomes are top coded, we set them to be 1.5 times above the top coded level, and we
drop observations with reported wages below half the minimum wage. We also drop
observations with imputed usual hours, weeks worked, income or occupation.
The OLS Mincerian relationship between hours worked and wages may not reflect a
causal relationship. They do, however, serve as a useful benchmark for illustrating the challenge
of accounting for the gender wage gap using conventional estimates of the return to hours
worked. Additionally, both Goldin (2014) and Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming) use this
relationship to categorize occupations into ones in which there is a high or low return to hours
worked. Our cross-occupation analysis is novel and suggests that the returns to hours worked are
much higher than can be explained by conventional Mincer estimates—strengthening the
empirical foundation for the conjecture that hours worked are central to understanding the gender
wage gap. We view our analysis as complementary to that of Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming) who
present quasi-experimental evidence that when barriers to labor supply are relaxed, high-skill
women work more and the gender pay gap is reduced. Of course, one must also exert caution in
interpreting these cross-occupation returns to hours worked, which we discuss in greater length
later.
Figure 1 shows the relationship between raw wages and hours at both the individual (left
panel) and occupational level (right panel). To illustrate the relationship between actual
individual hours worked and wages, we bin individuals into 1000 groups corresponding to the
logarithm of number of weekly hours they report usually working. For occupations, we compute
the average log hours and average log wages for occupations at the three digit level. The average
log wages and average log hours for each individual bin or occupation are plotted as open circles
on the figure, with the size of the circles corresponding to the size of the bin or occupation, as

7

determined by survey weights and the number of workers in each bin/occupation. The dark line
is the best fit line from a bivariate regression.
For individual level hours and wages, the relationship is not particularly strong, with a
slope of roughly 0.25. Without any adjustment for individual characteristics, this implies that
individuals who work more hours per week only earn slightly more per hour than those who
work fewer hours. In contrast, the relationship between occupational averages for hours and
wages is much stronger, with a slope of 2.35. Thus, individuals working in more time intensive
occupations have a substantially higher hourly wage than individuals working in less time
intense occupations.
This difference between the wage-hour relationship at the occupation level versus
individual level is robust across various samples and specifications. We first illustrate the
consistency of the wage-hour relationship at the individual level for several specifications. Table
1 reports estimates from a standard Mincer wage regression using individual level data from the
2016 American Community Survey (ACS). Specifically, we estimate variants of the following
model:
(1)

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽2 + 𝛿𝛿𝑜𝑜 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑜𝑜

where i indexes individuals and o indexes measured 3 digit occupation. The variables w and h
represent wages and hours respectively, and Xi is a vector of individual covariates including
binary indicators for race (black, Hispanic, Asian and other race) and gender, indicators for
educational attainment (high school only, some college and BA or higher), and a quartic in age.
𝛿𝛿𝑜𝑜 represents a set of occupation fixed effects. All regressions are weighted with the person

weights provided by ACS, and robust standard errors are clustered by three-digit occupation.

8

Column 1 of Table 1 presents estimates from the bivariate regression of log wage on log
hours, and corresponds closely to Figure 1. This indicates that a 10 percent increase in usual
hours worked is associated with 2.4 percent higher hourly wages. The inclusion of race, gender,
age and educational attainment in column 2 further reduces the coefficient on log hours.
To this point, we have not controlled for occupation fixed effects, however, and thus
these point estimates represent some weighted average of the returns to hours within and across
occupations. Including occupation fixed effects in column 3, we isolate the return to hours within
occupations and we find that this causes the estimated return to flip signs. Within occupation, a
10 percent increase in hours is associated with a 1.1 percent lower hourly wages.
Columns 4-5 show that this same basic pattern holds true for men and women. In results
available upon request, we show that the same general relationship holds for those with and
without a BA degree, and in samples limited to full-time, full-year workers, defined as those
working at least 40 weeks in the previous year and at least 35 hours per week.
Tables 2 and 3 shows that these relationships persist when using individual level data
from the March CPS pooled across years 2012-2017, including corrections for measurement
error and separately addressing hourly wage and salaried workers. Columns 1-3 mirror the
results from Table 1 that use ACS data. As in the ACS data, the bivariate relationship is positive
and significant (elasticity of .195) but falls to zero with the inclusion of basic controls and
becomes negative with the inclusion of occupation fixed effects. However, the hours worked
variable may be measured with error in CPS and ACS, which will introduce a negative bias in
our estimate of the impact of hours worked. To address this measurement error, the specification
in column 4 instruments for a worker’s reported usual hours this year with the usual hours the
individual reported in the prior March. Although the coefficient increases from -.14 to .15, it

9

remains small. Alternatively, column 5 instruments for a worker’s reported usual hours this year
using the number of hours the worker reported actually working in the prior week. The
coefficient is -.0004 and is statistically insignificant. 10
Table 3 uses the CPS’s Outgoing Rotation Groups and shows that the same general
pattern is present for wage earners and salary workers. 11 With the inclusion of occupation fixed
effects, the coefficient on log hours is .17 for wage earners. This rises slightly to .23 when we
instrument log hours using lagged hours. In contrast, salary workers have a negative relationship
between log hours and wages of -.22, after including individual level controls and occupation
fixed effects. Instrumenting for log hours with lagged hours increases the coefficient to .02,
which is statistically indistinguishable from zero.
In contrast to the consistently small estimated relationship between hours and wages at
the individual level, the relationship between hours and wages at the occupational level is
consistently large. Table 4 reports estimates from wage-hour regressions at the three-digit
occupation level in the 2016 ACS, corresponding to the aggregate relationship shown in Figure
1. 12 Specifically, we estimate variants of the following model:
(2)

wo =β o + β1ho + β 2taskso + ε o

where wo (ho ) indicate average of log wages (hours) in occupation 𝑜𝑜. The coefficient of 2.35 in

column 1 indicates that a 10 percent increase in hours worked is associated with a roughly 23.5
percent higher hourly wage. This relationship remains large when we residualize hours and

10

Using either of these instruments reduces the sample size to some extent, however, while unreported, reestimating the specifications in Columns 1-3 of the table with this smaller sample size does not meaningfully change
the coefficients.
11
Sample restrictions are identical to the previous two samples. We link individuals across years as in the ASEC
sample. One distinction from the ASEC and ACS/Census samples is that wages for wage earners in the ORG sample
are collected directly rather than computed, and wages of salary earners are computed by dividing weekly earnings
by usual hours worked.
12
We calculate respondent-weighted averages for each occupation.

wages. To construct these residuals, we regress log wage (hours) on the same demographics
used at the individual level (shown in column 3 of Table 1) as well as a full set of occupation
fixed effects. We use the coefficients on the occupation fixed effects as measures of average
residualized log wage and log hours. Column 2 shows the results of the bivariate regression of
residualized log wage on residualized log hours. The relationship between hours and wages is
still very large, with an elasticity greater than 2.
However, average hours might be correlated with other aspects of the occupation that
influence wages. To control for specific traits of each occupation, we follow the literature on
occupational tasks, and in columns 3-4 control for four measures of the tasks associated with
each occupation (Autor, Levy & Murnane 2003, Deming 2017). 13 While the return to average
hours decreases, it remains significantly large. In column 4, for example, the estimates suggest
that a 10 percent increase in average hours worked is associated with 11.7 percent higher hourly
wages. In columns 5-8, we replicate the specification from column 1 with different groups of
occupations. Column 5 (6) shows the results for high (low) skill occupations, which we define as
those above (below) the median in terms of fraction of workers in the occupation with at least a
BA degree. Column 7 (8) shows the results for female (male) dominated occupations, which we
define as those above (below) the median in terms of fraction female in the occupation. In all
cases, the coefficients are large, positive and significant. In results not shown, we find that these
results are very similar using the CPS.
The final empirical fact we establish is how these relationships in the cross-section have
changed over time. Figure 2 shows how these relationships have changed over time as measured

13

In particular we include abstract analytical, manual, routine and social tasks constructed from the ONET 4.0. For
more detail on how these are constructed, see Appendix A. There are seven occupations for which task measures are
unavailable, and thus these are dropped in these regressions. Running columns 1 and 2 with only occupations for
which we have task data does not materially change our results.

11

from the Census and the ACS. 14 We plot the coefficient on log hours in each year corresponding
to the regressions with individual controls and occupation fixed effects (Table 1 Column 3) and
the residualized occupation regressions (Table 4 Column 2).
Looking at the individual level wage-hours estimates, we see the relationship has
increased modestly between 1980 and 2016, but is always negative and small in absolute
magnitude. These individual-level results are consistent with those documented by Kuhn and
Lozano (2008), Cha and Weeden (2014), and Cortes and Pan (Forthcoming). Examining the
relationship between occupation level wages and hours, we see a much more dramatic change. In
1980, a 10 percent increase in occupation average hours was associated with a 9.4 percent
increase in average wages. By 2016, the relationship had doubled so that a 10 percent increase in
average hours was associated with a 20.2 percent increase in average wages. 15
As the returns to certain skills (e.g., cognitive ability and social skills) have increased
over this period (Autor, Murnane and Levy 2003; Deming 2017), we show in Figure 3 the
coefficients on hours at the occupation level controlling for tasks in each year. 16 We use the
same measures of tasks as in Table 4. The inclusion of task measures attenuates the coefficients
but the large in magnitude and positive coefficient on log hours remains across all time periods.
For example, without task controls the coefficient is 2.02 in 2016 and falls to 1.12 with task
controls.

14

In running these regressions, we use contemporaneous occupation codes. However, though we do not report it,
using time-consistent occupational codes does not impact our findings.
15
We have calculated analogous measures for the CPS, looking at 5-year moving averages of the coefficients to take
into account the smaller sample size. We also examined both OLS and IV estimates of the return to individual hours
worked. For the IV specifications, we instrument usual hours worked in the reference year with usual hours worked
in the prior year to account for measurement error. All these specifications generate a similar pattern.
16
Ideally, we would be able to control for the changing task composition within occupations over time. However,
O*NET only covers a limited period of time and is not easily mapped to its precursor, the Dictionary of
Occupational Titles. As a result, we use time-invariant task characteristics from O*NET 4.0. See Appendix A for
more details regarding task measurement.

12

To summarize, we find that the individual-level relationship between hours and wages is
small, negative within occupations and that it has changed only modestly over time. The
occupational level relationship between hours and wages is large has been growing over time.

3. Conceptual Framework
Our descriptive analysis demonstrates that the return to average hours worked at the
measured occupation are systematically higher than the corresponding return to a person’s actual
hours worked within the occupation. In this section, we present a framework for thinking about
this empirical result that has the potential to shed light on other economic phenomena of interest.
We assume that a job, j, is an employment contract offered by a firm and is associated
with a compensation level, 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , ℎ𝑗𝑗 �, which is a function of expected hours worked, ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , and

actual hours worked, ℎ𝑗𝑗 . These contracts are determined in hedonic equilibrium by firms offering

contracts consistent with profit maximization and workers choosing jobs consistent with utility
maximization. Consistent with our empirical results, we allow the return to expected hours to
differ from actual hours.

It is helpful to consider a few illustrative examples of common compensation schedules
that have this form and are consistent with our empirical observation. Consider first the case of
salaried workers. In this case, workers agree to a level compensation based on an expected
workload but the salary does not adjust in the short run to actual hours worked. This
compensation is determined in a simple hedonic equilibrium between workers and firms. Actual
hours worked may vary from expected hours due to variation in skill across workers, how busy
the firm is, idiosyncratic expectations of a demanding or lenient supervisor, or other reasons. In
the context of our framework, this implies that the compensation function has the following

13

form: 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , ℎ𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 �. This leads in a straightforward fashion to a potentially large return to

expected hours across jobs if 𝑐𝑐 ′ �ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 � is large, even as the individual’s personal compensation to

actual hours worked is zero. The implication for the actual hourly wage,

𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 �
ℎ𝑗𝑗

, is that the effect of

a marginal hour worked within a job is to reduce the wage, a phenomenon consistent with some
of our descriptive analysis.
While many jobs are salaried, other jobs pay wages per hour worked. In such jobs, it
seems natural to model the compensation function in the following way: 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑗𝑗 , where 𝑤𝑤

is the hourly wage. In such jobs, earnings scale linearly with hours worked. Even in these cases,
however, the firm may place restrictions on the range of hours offered to the worker. As a
consequence, it may not be possible to obtain a high wage hourly job without committing to an
expected hours of work, ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 . In this case, the menu of compensation across jobs may take the

following form: 𝑐𝑐�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , ℎ𝑗𝑗 � = 𝑤𝑤�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 �ℎ𝑗𝑗 . For an individual working an extra hour within a given
job, the wage is fixed at 𝑤𝑤�ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 �. However, moving across jobs, the wage may increase in

expected hours if in equilibrium 𝑤𝑤 ′ �ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 � > 0. Hence, in hourly jobs the wage return of an

increase in expected hours across jobs may be quite high, even as the wage is constant within a
job.
A natural exception to this is the case where workers are paid a higher hourly rate when
they are required to work overtime. This would suggest a higher relationship between actual
hours worked and wages, which is consistent with what we observe when splitting our results
into hourly wage workers and salaried workers in Table 3. However, if the possibility of
overtime is only available in jobs with already high expected hours, this still implies that
expected hours play a potentially substantial role in a worker’s compensation.
14

Both of these examples suggest that the wage return to expected hours of work across
jobs may be substantially larger than the wage return of actual hours worked. Our descriptive
analysis of the relationships between hours and wages is consistent with this conjecture. We
interpret the returns to hours across occupations as representing a useful approximation of the
return to expected hours, ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 . We believe that occupation average hours represents a good proxy
for expected hours since it is averaged across many jobs. Our preferred estimate of this is 2.03
from column 2 of Table 4.
The estimate that most closely relates to the returns to actual hours within jobs (or
deviations from expected hours) is -.11 from column 3 of Table 1 (where we include occupation
fixed effects). This estimate only partially reflects the returns to actual hours because some of the
variation in hours worked within occupation may represent differences in expected hours of
different jobs within three digit occupation. However, given that this estimate is so small, this is
consistent with the returns to actual hours being small, if not substantially negative.

4. Application to the Gender Wage Gap
Recent research emphasizes the role that job intensity (as measured by hours worked)
plays in the gender wage gap. Work in economics (Goldin 2014) and sociology (Cha and
Weeden 2014) suggests that the increasing prevalence of long work hours as well as the high
return to job intensity has slowed the convergence of the gender wage or earnings gap. It is well
documented that, on average, female workers work fewer hours than working men. In the 2016
ACS, for example, employed women work an average of 39.0 hours compared with 43.5 for
men, a difference of 4.5 hours. After accounting for race, age and education, this difference
increases to 4.8 hours. Controlling for three-digit occupation fixed effects as well, we find that

15

women still work 3.2 fewer hours than men. 17 In 1980, the raw gender difference was 6.7 hours
and falls to 5.0 hours after accounting for comparable demographics and occupation fixed
effects.
When thinking about how hours worked impacts the gender wage gap, it is helpful to
write a simple decomposition of the gap that focuses on the role of hours worked. Consider the
following regression similar to the earlier specifications but focusing on the residual gender
wage gap, which we denote by 𝛼𝛼. Given our focus on the role of hours worked, we abstract from
other covariates for expositional clarity, but they can be added easily.
(3)

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 = 𝜋𝜋 + 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

If we take expectations of this equation separately by gender, we obtain the following:
(4)
(5)

������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 = 𝜋𝜋 + 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 �����
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓
������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝜋𝜋 + 𝛽𝛽 �����
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

We can thus express the gender wage gap as
(6)

𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑤 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝ℎ

where 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑤 = ������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − ������
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝ℎ = �����
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 − �����
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 .

Note that the gender gap in hours is priced at rate 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛼𝛼 represents the residual wage gap.

Given the positive hours gap between men and women, as 𝛽𝛽 rises, the residual wage gap will

decline. Indeed, if 𝛽𝛽 becomes large enough, it is possible that the residual wage gap could be

negative, even with a substantial unconditional gender wage gap. As we have demonstrated

above, estimates of 𝛽𝛽 at the individual level regressions show hours worked has a weak positive
or even negative correlation with wages (see Table 1). Thus, a simple regression adjustment for
hours worked does little to close the residual gender wage gap.

If we limit our analysis to full-time full-year workers, women work 1.8 fewer hours than men in 2016.

16

Our conceptual framework offers different insights on how to handle gender differences
in hours worked. If the gender difference in hours worked is due to differences in expected hours
worked, ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , correcting for differences in hours worked using individual estimates will

systematically understate the contribution of hours worked to the gender wage gap. If instead the
gender difference in hours worked is related to actual hours worked, ℎ𝑗𝑗 rather than expected

hours ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑒𝑒 , then using individual level estimates of the returns to hours worked would be more

appropriate. 18 Because we do not observe whether an individual’s actual hours worked is due to
expected hours in the job or deviations from expected hours, researchers need to make an
assumption regarding which estimate of the returns is appropriate.
In column 1 of Table 5, we present a baseline residual wage gap in which we do not
account for hours or occupational choice at all. We do so by regressing log wages on a female
indicator variable as well as race, age, and education level. The coefficient on the female
indicator indicates a residual wage gap of .25 log points. We now consider alternative
specifications in which we make different assumptions regarding how hours should be taken into
account.
In column 2, we add to our minimal regression a simple control for the log of actual
hours worked. In this specification we do not control for occupation fixed effects as occupational
choice may be driven by differences in hours. This model implicitly assumes that there is no
difference in the returns between actual and expected hours. The coefficient on log hours
worked is quite small at .06, and reflects the return to some combination of actual and expected
hours (along with other occupation-specific factors that might be correlated with expected hours

18

Actual hours worked in individual level regressions will inherently be a mix of across-job variation in hours
worked and within-person variation in hours worked.

17

and wage). As a consequence, it does little to shrink the residual wage gap, which falls to .24.
This clearly illustrates the difficulty in explaining the gender wage gap by a simple regression
adjustment for hours worked.
In column 3, we add occupation fixed effects but eliminate the control for hours worked.
This specification implicitly controls for differences between men and women in the expected
hours associated with their occupational choices at the level of the 3-digit occupation codes we
observe. The inclusion of occupation fixed effects substantially reduces the residual gender wage
gap to .16. 19 This substantial reduction is due to the fact that the fixed effects control for not
only the expected occupational hours, but also any other occupational differences (e.g. tasks) that
drive compensation.
In column 4, we again include occupation fixed effects but also control for actual hours
worked. This regression prices the hour-wage relationship at the individual level. In this model,
the coefficient on log hours should be interpreted as the return to actual hours worked driven by
idiosyncractic factors such as supervisor requests, speed at completing tasks, etc. We estimate a
residual wage gap of .17, larger than what we find in the prior specification (column 3) in which
we do not control for hours. This is due to the fact that actual hours have a negative price in the
regression. As a consequence, the fact that women work fewer hours within occupations means
that they should have higher wages than men. 20 Hence, when we price hours based on the
individual-level wage equations, the residual gender wage gap essentially does not change at all.

19
Additionally, we have experimented with further including interaction terms between hours worked and
occupation fixed effects, which would allow for an occupation-specific wage-hours elasticity. However, including
these does not significantly change the point estimate on the residual gender wage gap.
20
In results available upon request, we show that accounting for measurement error in hours worked using the IV
strategy in Tables 2 and 3 does not substantively change the estimated residual gender wage gap.

18

However, at the other extreme, one can instead assume that the hours differences between
men and women, both across and within occupations, is driven entirely by gender differences in
choices about expected hours worked. Under this assumption, researchers would wish to price
the gender difference in hours at the expected hours wage rate. This implicitly assumes that the
expected hours wage rate is the same across measured occupations as well as across jobs within a
measured occupation. One tractable way to implement this thought experiment is to instrument
individuals’ actual hours with the occupation level average hours, omitting the individual’s own
contribution to this average. 21
Column 5 of Table 5 shows these results. Consistent with our expectation, the coefficient
on hours worked is 1.8, quite similar to the aggregate cross-occupation return to average hours
worked presented earlier. In this specification, the residual gender wage gap virtually disappears.
These results suggest that gender-correlated choices over job intensity could account for the
lion’s share of the difference in wages between men and women.
As we showed in Section 3, occupational average hours worked is correlated with jobrelated tasks. It is unclear whether it is appropriate to control for such factors. If we control for
occupation task measures, this reduces the estimated coefficient on hours worked, which has the
effect of increasing the residual wage gap. It may be that women prefer to work in jobs with task
requirements correlated with high hours, such as abstract reasoning and team management, but
do not enter these jobs because of the concomitant expectation of high hours. In this case,
controlling for occupation tasks understates the importance of hours when estimating the gender
wage gap. On the other hand, if women choose not to work in some high-hours jobs not because

21

We do not control for occupational fixed effects, since they are collinear with the occupational average hours.
This method is similar to that used in Angrist (1991).

19

of the hours, but rather because of the associated tasks, one would wish to account for the task
mix of the job and other correlated characteristics including scheduling flexibility.
In column 6 of Table 5, we consider this possibility. Again, we instrument hours worked
with average occupational hours (omitting the reference individual). However, we control in the
second stage for the set of occupational tasks discussed earlier. This has the effect of lowering
the return to hours worked to 1.2. Relative to the prior specification, controlling for task mix
expands the residual gender wage gap to 0.08. The gap, however, remains substantially narrower
than cases in which hours are priced at the actual hours rate implicit in the individual level
regressions. 22
Ultimately, with available data it is not knowable the extent to which the gender hours
gap is driven by actual versus expected hours. However, evidence suggests that the difference in
realized hours is a reflection of desire for lower expected hours among women and should be
priced accordingly. In particular, recent work has shown that men and women have different
willingness to pay for flexible work arrangements (e.g. Mas and Pallais 2017, Wiswall and Zafar
2017). Though unreported, we also find a substantial correlation between the gender hours gaps
and wage gaps within occupations, even when controlling for demographic characteristics. 23
Thus, there is evidence that gender gaps in observed individual hours worked may be priced at a
higher level than implied by standard Mincerian specifications.

22
The number of observations is slightly lower in column 6 compared with columns 1 through 5. This is because a
small number of occupations do not have ONET task information. If we replicate the specifications in columns 1-5
on the sample used in column 6, the results are qualitatively the same.
23
Using the pricing implied by the slope on within occupation regressions of gender wage gaps and hours gaps with
empirical Bayes corrections for measurement error implies a similar reduction in the gender wage gap as in Column
4 of Table 5, where we use the pricing of hours from occupation-level regressions controlling for tasks.

20

Gender Wage Gap over Time
The difference between women’s log wages and men’s log wages has shrunk
considerably since the 1980s, but flattened in recent years, as shown by the blue trend line in
Figure 4. Over this same period, the gender gap in log hours worked has closed somewhat (red
trend line in Figure 4), although by much less, and in 2016 women still work notably fewer hours
than men on average. The green trend line in Figure 4 illustrates the increasing returns to hours
worked at the occupation level, which we estimated earlier and also show in Figures 2 and 3.
Taken together, these facts suggest that wage convergence between men and women would have
been larger if the wage premium for hours worked had remained the same. In this section, we
consider what the evolution of the gender gap would have been if the returns to hours worked
had remained at 1980 levels.
To begin, we estimate individual level wage regressions separately by year for 1980,
1990, 2000 and 2016. We do so both estimating the relation between wages and hours worked
via OLS and also via IV in which we instrument individual hours with occupational average
hours. This allows us to consider how the counterfactual wage gap would have evolved had the
return to hours not increased. Our primary empirical specification is given by:
(7)

𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡 + 𝛼𝛼 𝑡𝑡 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + γt 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

Because changing demographics and the coefficients on those demographics are not the focus of
the analysis, while we control for them in our analysis, we ignore them for the purposes of
presentation. Building on the logic we developed in our static analysis, we can write the gender
wage gap (conditional upon demographic covariates) as

21

(8)

𝑡𝑡
𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑤
= 𝛼𝛼 𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑡𝑡 𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑡𝑡

This expression allows us to consider how the gender wage gap would have increased if the
residual wage gap evolved according to the observed time series but the prices on hours
remained constant at 1980 levels. Put another way, we allow the unexplained part of the gender
wage gap to change period by period but fix the returns to hours worked at 1980 levels.
Again, we are faced with the question of what price should be used to relate the hours gap
to the wage gap period by period. In Table 6 we present these results for four different prices
for log hours worked. In each of the cases, row 1 shows the evolution of the gap described in
equation (8) above—that is, the residual wage gap plus the wage gap that can be explained by the
gender gap in hours. Row 2 considers the counterfactual evolution of the gap assuming that the
residual gap evolved according to the observed time series but the prices on hours are held
constant at 1980 levels. Row 3 shows the percentage difference between Row 1 and Row 2—
how different the gender wage gap would have been if returns to hours remained constant at
1980 levels.
First consider the top panel, where we price the hours gap at the rate implied by the return
to actual hours, controlling for the standard covariates. We do not control for occupation fixed
effects, instead pricing both hours within and across occupations at the single price indicated by
this regression. We find that the total residual and hours related wage gap declined from 0.43 to
0.25 over the time period, with the bulk occurring between 1980 and 1990. Performing our
counterfactual exercise, we show that gender wage gap would have been roughly 20 percent
smaller in the year 2016 had the returns to hours worked not increased over the time period.
Note that even though the return to hours worked is very small in 2016, it was negative in 1980.
Thus even though hours does little to explain the residual wage gap in the contemporary cross-

22

section, the change in the return to actual hours still can still account for a portion of the change
in the gender wage gap.
In the second panel, we base our analysis on specifications in which we control for
occupation fixed effects. Doing so removes from the residual wage gap the contribution of hours
associated with differences in expected hours across occupations. As a consequence, the level of
the gender wage gap falls relative to the other specifications. However, we find that the reduction
in the gender wage gap is comparable to the first case, with the counterfactual wage gap being
roughly 24 percent lower than the actual wage gap.
We next consider the case in which the hours gap is priced at the rate implied by the
cross-occupation wage-hours schedule. 24 As we did in the prior section, we implement this by
instrumenting actual hours worked with the leave-out mean of hours in each occupation. We do
not control for occupation fixed effects and instead price out all hours, both within and across
occupation, at the rate estimated in our instrumental variables specification. In the third panel of
Table 6, we show the results corresponding to this specification. With the large increase in the
return to expected hours, the counterfactual wage gap would have been substantially lower had
the hours premium remained at 1980 levels. By 2016, the gap would have been 46 percent
lower.
For the bottom panel, we perform the same analysis but control for the occupational task
mix. The results are qualitatively similar to the prior panel. Had the hours premium remained
fixed at 1980 levels, the counterfactual gender wage gap would have been 34 percent lower in
2016. Thus, although the hours gap between men and women has been closing over this time

24

Note that the residual wage gap plus the wage gap explained by the hours gap is nearly identical to what we saw
in the first panel. The primary difference is the portion of the gap that is explained by the difference in hours.

23

period, it has not closed as rapidly as the return to hours has grown and thus this has exacerbated
the gender wage gap from 1980 to 2016.

5. Conclusions
In this paper we consider the manner in which wages are related to hours worked. We
demonstrate that while the hours worked by an individual has only a weak relationship with
wages, the average hours within an occupation is much more strongly related to wages. This
relationship holds, controlling for individual characteristics and occupation tasks. Indeed, a 10
percent increase in occupational hours worked is associated with between a 10 and 20 percent
increase in wages depending on the specification.
We examine how this relationship has changed over time. We find that while the
relationship between actual hours worked and wages has increased modestly, the relationship
between occupational average hours and wages has doubled between 1980 and 2016. This
substantial increase is observed whether or not we control for the occupational task mix. This is
consistent with prior literature showing that the return to hours worked has risen over time.
We present a framework to rationalize this finding in which equilibrium compensation is
a function of expected and actual hours. In the context of this framework, we provide clear
settings in which expected hours would be priced at a much higher level than the deviations from
expected hours. These findings are consistent with what we observe in the data.
Informed by these empirical findings and our conceptual framework, we revisit the
gender wage gap. Because hours have such a weak relationship with wages, they explain very
little of the gender wage gap. In the context of our framework, we demonstrate that the extent to

24

which the gender wage gap is mediated by hours worked depends crucially on whether we
assume the hours difference is priced according to the empirical schedule for expected hours or
rather hours deviations. If we assume that the gender difference in hours worked should be
priced according to the relationship we observe across occupations, then hours worked accounts
for virtually all of the unexplained gender wage gap. If we price hours according to the crossoccupation schedule and control for the occupational task mix, hours differences account for
approximately half of the gender wage gap. These results imply that the findings of Cortes and
Pan (Forthcoming) that increases in labor supply have important wage effects generalize to a
broader sample of U.S. workers.
Given that return to hours worked has risen over time, we examine how the gender wage
gap would have counterfactually evolved had the return to hours worked not risen relative to
1980. We do so under various assumptions regarding the pricing of hours worked. Consistent
with Cha and Weeden (2014), the increase in returns to hours worked imply that the
counterfactual wage gap would have been substantially narrower had the price of hours not
increased over time. Significantly, if we price hours worked according to the occupation-level
relationship, the counterfactual gender wage gaps would have been between 31 and 46 percent
smaller. This suggests that the increase in the return to occupational intensity made it
increasingly difficult for women to achieve wage parity with men.
Further research is needed to obtain more precise estimates of the pricing of hours
differences between men and women at the individual level. We also leave for further research a
greater understanding of why the returns to hours have increased over time and additional
implications of this change.

Appendix A
Creating Task Measures
Task measures are constructed from the raw data in the ONET 4.0. We first standardize the raw
level variables to be mean zero and standard deviation one across the 900 ONET-SOC occupation
codes. We then collapse to 677 soc2000 codes by taking the simple average across ONET-SOC
codes associated with a single soc2000 code. 25 The composites are created as the average of the
included variables (see details below) and are standardized.
For analysis that uses data from 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2016 we merge on task data using David
Dorn’s occ1990dd classification system. The occ1990dd system consists of 330 codes that provide
a balanced panel of occupations covering the 1980, 1990 and 2000 Censuses and the 2005 ACS.
For the purpose of our analysis, we extend the coverage to the 2016 ACS by creating a crosswalk
from the codes used in the 2016 ACS to the occ1990dd system. We start with the composite task
measures at the soc2000 level and merge on soc2000 weights. We create soc2000 weights by
pooling data from the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey.26
We then collapse task measures to the occ2000 and standardize, yielding composite task measures
for 445 occ2000 codes. Lastly, we use the occ2000 to occ1990dd from Dorn (2009) and the sum
of soc2000 weights for each occ2000 code to collapse task measures to the occ1990dd level. The
final dataset merged onto data for 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2016 consist of task data for 325
occupations standardized to be mean zero and standard deviation one. Thus, there are five
occ1990dd occupations for which we are unable to obtain task data; these map into seven
occupations in the 2016 ACS coding system. 27
We use four composite task measures in our analysis taken previously from the literature. Each
measure is constructed as the average of the included variables. For each composite the variable
names are given in italics, the variable type in parenthesis and the variable question text in
quotations.
1. Social Skills (Deming 2017):
- Coordination: (skill) “Adjusting actions in relation to others' actions.”
- Negotiation: (skill) “Bringing others together and trying to reconcile differences.”
- Persuasion: (skill) “Persuading others to change their minds or behavior.”
- Social Perceptiveness: (skill) “Being aware of others' reactions and understanding
why they react as they do.”
2. Abstract Analytical (Acemoglu & Autor 2011):
- Interpreting the Meaning of Information for Others: (work activity) “Translating or
explaining what information means and how it can be used.”

25

For example, onetsoccode 11-1011.01 and 11-1011.02 are collapsed into soc2000 code 11-1011.
Specifically, we follow the procedure used by Autor & Acemoglu (2011) to create soc2000 weights from the
2005, 2006 and 2007. Weights are calculated as the mean of employment across the three survey waves for each soc
code.
27
The occ1990dd occupations for which we cannot construct task data are occupations 76, 346, 37, 349 and 415.

- Importance of Repeating Same Tasks: (context) “How important is repeating the same

28

The measure of routine used in Acemoglu & Autor 2011 also included the variable Structured versus
Unstructured Work (“To what extent is this job structured for the worker, rather than allowing the worker to
determine tasks, priorities, and goals?”) but the variable is unavailable in the ONET 4.0 and responses were not
gathered until subsequent installations of the ONET.

All columns use standard errors clustered at the occupation level. Columns (3)-(5) and (8)-(10) include occupation fixed effects. Columns (4) and (8)
instruments usual hours worked with usual hours worked, reported in the previous March. Columns (5) and (10) instruments usual hours worked with actual
hours worked the week previous to the survey. Occupations aggregated to occs as classified in the 2012-2017 Current Population Survey. Observations are
weighted using earnwt. Sample includes prime-age workers aged 25-55. Demographic controls include a quartic in age, indicators for race/ethnicity (black,
Hispanic, Asian, other), sex, and indicators for educational attainment (HS degree, some college, college degree or more). Hours are derived from usual hours
worked per week. Hourly wage is calculated weekly wage and salary income divided usual hours worked. We inflate wages to 2012 dollars using the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA) National Income and Product Accounts Personal Consumption Expenditures.

Columns (1)-(8) use robust standard errors. Columns (1) and (3) regress occupation average of log wage on occupation average of log hours. Occupations are
weighted by the occupation total of perwt. Columns (2) and (4) regress occupation average of residualized log wage on occupation average of residualized log
hours. Residuals are constructed by regressing log wage (hours) on demographic controls and a full set of occupation fixed effects. We use the coefficients on the
occupation fixed effects as measures of average residualized log wage and log hours. Demographic controls used in the residualization include black, hispanic,
asian, other race, hs only, some college, ba plus and a quartic in age. Hours are derived from usual hours worked per week. Hourly wage is calculated as total
reported wage and salary income for the prior year divided by the product of usual hours worked and weeks worked in the previous year. We trim wages that are
below half of the federal minimum wage and inflate wages to 2012 dollars using the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National Income and Product Accounts
Personal Consumption Expenditures. High (low) skill occupations are defined as those above (below) the median in terms of fraction of workers in the occupation
with at least a BA degree. Female (male) dominated occupations are defined as those above (below) the median in terms of fraction female in the occupation. Task
data is constructed from the ONET 4.0 aggregated to the occ1990dd level. There are five occ1990dd occupations missing task data in the ONET 4.0 which yield
missing task data for seven occs. Task controls include social skills, as defined in Deming(2017), and abstract analytical, manual and routine, as in Acemoglu &
Autor (2011). See appendix A for an explanation how of these composites were created. Task measures are standardized to be mean zero and standard deviation
one across the occ1990dd distribution.

Columns (3) and (4) include occupation fixed effects. Columns (5) and (6) are IV regression with individual log
hours instrumented with occupation average log hours, thus occupation fixed effects cannot be included. Occupation
average log hours are calculated using a leave-out mean by excluding the individual's hours. Standard errors are
clustered at the occ level. Occupations aggregated to occs as classified in the 2016 American Community Survey.
Observations are weighted using perwt. Sample includes prime-age workers aged 25-55. Demographic controls
include a quartic in age, indicators for race/ethnicity (black, Hispanic, Asian, other), and indicators for educational
attainment (HS degree, some college, college degree or more). Hours are derived from usual hours worked per
week. Hourly wage is calculated as total reported wage and salary income for the prior year divided by the product
of usual hours worked and weeks worked in the previous year. We trim wages that are below half of the federal
minimum wage and inflate wages to 2012 dollars using the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National Income
and Product Accounts Personal Consumption Expenditures. We merge on task data constructed from the ONET 4.0
aggregated to the occ1990dd level. There are five occ1990dd occupations missing task data in the ONET 4.0 which
yield missing task data for seven occs. Task controls include social skills, as defined in Deming(2017), and abstract
analytical, manual and routine, as in Acemoglu & Autor (2011). See appendix A for an explanation how of these
composites were created. Task measures are standardized to be mean zero and standard deviation one across the
occ1990dd distribution.

Occupations aggregated to occs as classified in the 2016 American Community Survey. Observations are weighted
using perwt. Sample includes prime-age workers aged 25-55. The gap in hours (𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑡𝑡 ) corresponds to the difference
between male and female log hours in year t. In the first panel, 𝛽𝛽1980 is the coefficient on log hours fro a regression
of log wage on a female dummy and a set of demographic controls. The second panel adds in occupation controls to
derive the coefficient on log hours, 𝛽𝛽1980 . In the third panel 𝛽𝛽1980 is the coefficient from log hours in a IV regression
of log wage on female, demographic controls and individual log hours instrumented with occupation average log
hours. Occupation average log hours are calculated using a leave-out mean by excluding the individual's hours. In the
fourth panel add occupation tasks controls to derive the coefficient on log hours, 𝛽𝛽1980 . In each panel 𝛼𝛼 𝑡𝑡 is the
coefficient on female and 𝛽𝛽 𝑡𝑡 is the coefficient on log hours from the corresponding regression in year t. All regressions
include a quadratic in age, dummies for black, Hispanic, Asian and other race, high school only, some college and at
least a bachelor’s degree. Hours are derived from usual hours worked per week. Hourly wage is calculated as total
reported wage and salary income for the prior year divided by the product of usual hours worked and weeks worked
in the previous year. We trim wages that are below half of the federal minimum wage and inflate wages to 2012 dollars
using the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National Income and Product Accounts Personal Consumption
Expenditures. Task data are constructed from the ONET 4.0 aggregated to the occ1990dd level. There are five
occ1990dd occupations missing task data in the ONET 4.0 which yield missing task data for seven occs. Social skills
are as defined in Deming(2017), abstract analytical, manual and routine as in Acemoglu & Autor (2011). See appendix
A for an explanation how of these composites were created. Task measures are standardized to be mean zero and
standard deviation one across the occ1990dd distribution.
