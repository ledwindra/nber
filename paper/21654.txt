ABSTRACT
Policymakers are increasingly interested in reducing healthcare costs and inefficiencies through innovative
payment strategies. These strategies may have heterogeneous impacts across geographic areas, potentially
reducing or exacerbating geographic variation in healthcare spending. In this paper, we exploit a major
payment reform for home health care to examine whether reductions in reimbursement lead to differential
changes in treatment intensity and provider costs depending on the level of competition in a market.
Using Medicare claims, we find that while providers in more competitive markets had higher average
costs in the pre-reform period, these markets experienced larger proportional reductions in treatment
intensity and costs after the reform relative to less competitive markets. This led to a convergence
in spending across geographic areas. We find that much of the reduction in provider costs is driven
by greater exit of “high-cost” providers in more competitive markets.

1. Introduction
With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), policy
makers are increasingly looking to reduce both health care costs and inefficiencies in care by
restructuring the ways that Medicare pays health care providers. High costs and inefficiencies
have long been attributed to the traditional “cost-based” reimbursement model, where health care
providers are paid separately for each service provided. In addition, competition has been shown
to increase costs under cost-based reimbursement, with health care providers competing for
patients based on quality and amenities which generate higher costs (Robinson and Luft 1987,
Zwanziger and Melnick 1988). In this way, competition may also drive geographic variation in
costs of care since there is considerable variation in market concentration across areas.
Over the past 30 years, Medicare has progressively moved away from cost-based
reimbursement towards prospective payment, where a health care provider receives a set
payment for an episode of care based on the characteristics of the patient. These payment
reforms occurred in 1983 for hospitals and in the late 1990s and early 2000s for providers of
post-acute care (e.g., skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and inpatient rehabilitation
facilities). Extensive evidence shows that the shift to prospective payment had varying effects
on health care costs across setting, with more “prospective” reforms and those reducing marginal
payments leading to larger cost reductions (Newhouse and Byrne 1988, Grabowski, Afendulis et
al. 2011, Sood, Huckfeldt et al. 2013, Huckfeldt, Sood et al. 2014). In addition, there is some
evidence that the relationship between competition and quality (or costs) also changed after
prospective payment. For example, data from California show that costs fell more for providers
in the most competitive markets after the Inpatient Prospective Payment System was
implemented in 1983 (Meltzer, Chung et al. 2002). However, the implementation of the Inpatient
3

Prospective Payment System coincided with the implementation of selective contracting and
rapid penetration of managed care in California. Thus, it is unclear the extent to which the
differential effects on costs were related to implementation of prospective payment versus other
contemporaneous trends.
In this paper we revisit the question of whether provider payment reforms, which reduce
the marginal reimbursement to health care providers, may have a differential effect depending on
the level of provider competition in a health care market. We start with the premise that
differences in the level of competition across health care markets is an important source of
geographic variation in health care costs, with markets with greater competition under costbased reimbursement having higher costs or intensity of care. Prior research also suggests that
greater competition in health care markets with administered prices might lead to socially
wasteful spending (Gaynor 2006). We next develop a stylized model that evaluates how the
impact of payment reform on costs or intensity of care might vary by the level of competition in
the market. We predict that payment reform reduces costs more in more competitive markets.
Thus, it is possible that payment reform can simultaneously reduce costs and reduce geographic
variation in care as it will lead to convergence in costs across more and less competitive markets.
We empirically test our predictions by investigating a significant Medicare payment
reform for home health agencies: the 1997 Interim Payment System (IPS). The IPS offers an
interesting case study as it imposed limits on payments to home health agencies in what was a
cost-based reimbursement system, dramatically reducing reimbursement to home health agencies
by nearly 50 percent (US Government Accountability Office 2000). Moreover, there is evidence
that post-acute care is a key driver of the still-substantial geographic variation in Medicare
spending (Newhouse and Garber 2013), suggesting significant scope for payment reforms
4

targeted at post-acute care in reducing overall geographic variation in spending. Although
several studies have analyzed the effects of IPS, none have looked at how the effects of the IPS
on costs or intensity of care varied by the initial level of competition in the market (McCall,
Komisar et al. 2001, Liu, Long et al. 2002, McCall, Petersons et al. 2003, Murtaugh, McCall et
al. 2003, Porell, Liu et al. 2006, Huckfeldt, Sood et al. 2013, Huckfeldt, Sood et al. 2014). In this
paper we add to this literature by analyzing how the effects of IPS varied by the level of
competition. We also analyze the pathways or mechanisms that might explain the heterogeneous
impact of IPS across markets with different levels of competition.
The empirical results are consistent with the predictions from the theoretical model. We
find that there was significant variation in costs by level of competition in the pre-IPS period,
with more competitive markets having higher costs. After the IPS, costs declined in all markets
but there were larger declines in costs in more competitive markets. The decline in costs was
driven by both changes in the probability of any home health use (extensive margin) and a
decline in the number of home health days among existing users (intensive margin). As a result
of the heterogeneous response to the payment reform, costs and the number of home health days
converged in more and less competitive markets and the significant variation in costs or intensity
of care by level of competition in the pre-IPS period nearly disappeared in the post-IPS period.
In robustness tests, we show that more competitive markets are more likely to be urban
with larger populations, but the heterogeneous response of IPS persists even after we flexibly
control for differences in observable characteristics between less and more competitive markets.
Payment limits under the IPS were partially determined by the difference between a home health
agency’s costs relative to the census division average, which varies systematically across regions
and may be correlated with competition levels. However, we find larger cost reductions in more
5

competitive markets even after controlling for heterogeneity in the reform’s “bite” across areas.
Finally, we show that the larger impact of IPS in more competitive markets is driven by two
factors. First, we observe greater exit of home health agencies in more competitive markets.
Second, the home health agencies that exited more competitive markets were more likely to be
“high-cost” agencies. Thus, payment reform serves to eliminate some of the most inefficient
providers, especially those that are operating in highly competitive markets.
Overall these findings imply that payment reform is not only an important tool for
reducing health care costs but it can affect geographic variation in care and health system
efficiency by changing incentives and influencing market dynamics. Under the ACA, Medicare
is adopting new provider payment reforms such as bundled payment and accountable care
organizations, which represent further shifts towards capitation. The extent to which these
reforms can further reduce costs and improve efficiency – and potentially reduce variation in
health care spending- depends in part on the differential effects of such reforms across markets
with different levels of competition.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the IPS. Section 3 builds a
conceptual framework. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 discusses our empirical strategy
and section 6 discusses the results.
2. Background
From 1989 to 1996, Medicare home health expenditures more than quintupled, rising
from $3.4 billion to $19.2 billion. In addition, between 1990 and 1996 the number of
beneficiaries using the home health benefit almost doubled from 1.9 million to 3.7 million and
the number of visits per patient grew from 33 visits to 76 visits (United States Congress 2000).

6

Much of this growth was spurred by the 1988 Duggan v. Bowen court case, which drastically
broadened the eligibility criteria for the Medicare home health benefit. In response to rising
costs, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) mandated that the home health payment policy be
reformed. The BBA called for a Prospective Payment System (PPS) and immediately enacted an
Interim Payment System (IPS) to address the rising costs while the PPS was being developed.
The IPS went into effect in October 1997 and lasted for 3 years before being replaced by the PPS
in October 2000.
Before the IPS, Medicare home health payment policy was a cost based reimbursement
system subject to a per-visit limit on costs. This limit was set at the lower of an agency’s
“reasonable costs” or 112% of the national average of per visit costs. The implementation of IPS
imposed stricter per-visit cost limits (reduction in average reimbursement) and introduced a perbeneficiary total annual cost limit (reduction in marginal reimbursement). Specifically, IPS
introduced per-visit limits equal to 105% of the national median cost per visit for newer home
health agencies that entered the market after 1994. Older home health agencies faced a limit that
was a weighted average of the agency’s average per patient costs in 1994 (75%) and their census
division per patient costs (25%). A home health agency received payment equal to the lower of
its actual costs, its per-visit cost limit, or the per-beneficiary cost limit.
McCall et al. (2001) and McKnight (2006) found a large decrease in home health
utilization and the number of visits per user following IPS. Huckfeldt et al. (2013) found that the
IPS reduced average payments and that this decline in reimbursement decreased utilization of
home health services with little change in readmission and mortality. The decline in use of home
health care coupled with lack of changes in readmission rates and mortality suggests that the IPS
increased efficiency in the home health care industry. While prior work has investigated
7

heterogeneous effects of the IPS by geography, such work has focused on variation in the
average reimbursement change after IPS across markets which stems from payment limits being
based on average census division costs (McKnight 2006). One study does look at entry and exit
effects by level of competition (as measured by the number of home health agencies in a market)
and find that markets with more home health agencies experienced more supply changes after
IPS (Porell, Liu et al. 2006). However, no studies have looked at how the impact of IPS on costs
or utilization varies by level of competition, which is the focus of this paper.
Other related work has investigated trends in hospital costs in California during a period
when California experienced several important cost containment measures including the
introduction of Medicare inpatient prospective system, introduction of selective contracting for
Medicaid patients and diffusion of managed care in private insurance markets. This literature
finds that during this time reduction in costs were largest for the most competitive markets
(Zwanziger and Melnick 1988, Meltzer, Chung et al. 2002). We examine whether there was a
differential impact of IPS in more versus less competitive markets. The IPS provides an
important case study due to the large magnitude of overall reductions in payments. Moreover,
the wide variation in home health competition across markets generates an ideal context for
studying how competition affects responses to payment reform. Understanding how the effects
of prior Medicare payment reforms varied across more and less competitive markets provide
important evidence on the potential effects of reforms underway, and how they may affect
geographic variation in Medicare spending.
3. Conceptual Model
In this paper, we are interested in how agencies adjust their intensity of care (in this
context intensity can be viewed as the number of visits per episode of care) in response to
8

payment reform across markets with different levels of competition. We develop a conceptual
model based on papers by Brekke, Siciliani, and Straume (2011) and Hodgkin and
McGuire(1994).
Changes in an agency’s intensity of care can have two effects on demand – a market
stealing effect (attracting a patient from another home health agency) and a market expansion
effect (attracting a patient from another post-acute care provider or a patient who was not
planning on getting any post-acute care). To illustrate and isolate these effects we consider two
types of patients. The first, H type patients have a high value of home health care. These are
patients who are much more suited to home health care; they get a large amount of utility from
remaining in their homes and will not switch to other post-acute options as long as home health
care is provided at a baseline level of intensity. We assume this market is saturated such that
increasing intensity will not draw any new H type patients into the market, increasing intensity
will only steal them from other firms. So changes in demand by H type patients isolates the
market stealing effect of changes in intensity of care. The second, L type patients have a lower
value of home health care. These patients are willing to utilize other types of post-acute care, like
nursing homes, or forgo post-acute care if home health intensity is not high enough. To isolate
the market expansion effect we assume that the L type patient market is never saturated;
increasing intensity will draw in new L type patients to the market but will not steal L types from
other firms. We can model patient utility as:

Where

or

is the value that the patient puts on home health service at a baseline intensity that

we arbitrarily set as

for convenience. The extra utility that a patient gets from a firm
9

providing intensity above
is

is

. For simplicity, let

. The disutility of “mismatch costs”

. Firm demand is derived using a Salop circle model, classically the circle represents

the physical distance between each firm, but since home health patients do not travel to the
agency providing them service we think of the circle as a “firm specialization” space. The
distance between firms represents the different sets of skills or attributes that firms may have.
Thus the “distance” could be based on clinical condition of the patient and specialization of
home health agency in treating that condition or it could more generally reflect differences in
patient preferences for receiving care from a particular agency. Thus, x denotes the mix of home
health agency attributes preferred by the patient, zi indicates the mix of attributes characterizing
the agency i, and

represents how good of a fit a patient is for a specific home health

agency, is the marginal cost of the “distance” between the patients’ preferences and an
agency’s attributes. The smaller the “distance” between the firm and the patient, the better the fit
and lower the mismatch cost.
In our model, price is regulated and takes the form

, where α is average

reimbursement and β is marginal reimbursement. This formulation allows Medicare’s payment
of home health agencies to occur on a spectrum ranging from cost based reimbursement system
to prospective payment

. Firm costs are separable and the

marginal cost of an additional patient is constant for any given level of intensity,
where

is the demand for firm i and

is the cost of intensity per

patient.
We normalize patient density on the circle and the total length of the circle to one. There
are n firms evenly distributed about the circle, such that their distance apart is equal to 1/n. The
patient population is split between H and L types where a fraction λ are H type and 1-λ are L
10

type. To find demand for each patient type, we first find their point of indifference along the
circle between the first firm, i, and a second firm, j, for H type:

And for L type patients where agencies have a local monopoly patients are indifferent between
receiving home health care and the outside option whose utility is normalized to zero:

Total demand is given by multiplying (1) and (2) by two times the fraction of H or L type
patients.

The combination of having H and L type patients in the model separates the “market stealing”
and “market expansion” effects of an agency increasing its intensity of care. When a firm
increases its intensity, it “steals” H type patients from other agencies and “expands” the market
by attracting new L type patients who otherwise would not receive home health. We gain greater
insight from looking at how demand changes with intensity:

11

Both the “market stealing” (the second inequality) and the “market growth” (the third inequality)
components of demand contribute a positive, constant return to intensity. In addition, the market
growth is usually the primary driver of the return to intensity; only at high levels of H types in
the market (λ>2/3) does the “market stealing” component over power the “market growth”
component. We also look at how demand changes with number of firms:

As the number of firms increase, there is a decrease in demand for each firm coming from the H
type patients switching to new agencies, but no effect from the L type patients.
In this model we assume that firms are profit maximizing, while in reality they may
exhibit altruistic behavior. A version of our model that includes altruism can be found in the
appendix. We found that our predictions are similar to the for-profit analysis presented here
except when firms exhibit a high degree of altruism. However, the empirical literature suggests
that the level of altruism in hospitals and post-acute care providers is not great enough to
differentiate for profit from nonprofit utility maximizing actions. Pauly (1987) reviews
theoretical and empirical literature and finds no significant differences in market behavior
between for profit and nonprofit firms (Pauly 1987). More recently, Duggan (2000) finds that
nonprofit hospitals are no more altruistic than for profit hospitals and that they respond similarly
to pricing incentives.(Duggan 2000) Additionally, Sloan, Picone, Taylor, and Chou (2001) find
no difference in outcomes for for-profit vs nonprofit hospitals (Sloan, Picone et al. 2001). For
these reasons, we restrict our analysis to classic for-profit profit maximization and include an
analysis that includes altruism in the Appendix.
Firms profit maximize, as in (4):
12

With the first order condition for intensity allocation being:

We substitute equation (3) into (5) and set qi=q j to solve for optimum intensity q*.

Proposition 1: The intensity of care increases with number of firms.
To solve for dq/dn we take the total derivative of the first order condition:

We can see that dq is simply the second order condition of profit maximization, and is, by
definition, always less than zero.

13

The denominator is the negative of the second order condition therefore is positive, so the sign is
determined by the numerator. The numerator is also positive given that costs are increasing and
there is a non-zero amount of H type patients in the market.
Proposition 2: A decline in marginal reimbursement has larger effect on intensity of care in
more competitive markets.
To see this, consider how dq/dn changes with marginal reimbursement:

To understand why this relationship is positive, we look back to the first order condition, which
simplifies to:

The right hand side (RHS) of the equation is the marginal cost of increasing intensity and the left
hand side (LHS) of the equation is the marginal benefit of increasing intensity. An increase in
intensity decreases profits because it increases the marginal cost of providing care for
inframarginal patients (RHS). However an increase in intensity raises profits because it increases
demand and firms enjoy a positive margin on the marginal patients (LHS). The marginal benefit
curve slopes downwards as profit margins decline with intensity. The marginal benefit term or
the LHS is independent of the number of firms as the profit margin is a function of
reimbursement policies and the slope of marginal cost curve while and the responsiveness of
demand to intensity is a function of patient preferences (see expression for

14

derived earlier in

the theory section). However, the number of firms in the market does affect the RHS as an
increase in the number of firms reduces the number of inframarginal patients a firm has. Thus the
marginal cost curve for intensity shifts downwards as the number of firms rises (see Figure 1)
and consequently intensity is higher in more competitive markets.
An increase in marginal reimbursement pivots the marginal benefit curve for intensity upwards
as increases in intensity have a smaller effect on profit margins when marginal reimbursement is
higher. This has a larger effect on intensity in more competitive markets, as equilibrium intensity
is higher in more competitive markets. Similarly, an increase in reimbursement also pivots the
marginal cost curve for intensity downward as providing care to inframarginal patients now has a
smaller effect on profits. Again this downward pivot induces a larger effect on intensity in more
competitive markets, as equilibrium intensity is higher in more competitive markets. This effect
is shown in Figure 1. In the figure, the points labeled A denote the level of intensity before an
increase in marginal reimbursement. It is clear that intensity of care in the market with more
competition leads to a higher baseline level of intensity. When marginal reimbursement
increases, the marginal benefit curve pivots upwards and the marginal cost curves pivot
downward as previously stated. A new equilibrium level of intensity is achieved at the points
labeled B. The change in intensity for less competitive markets (low n) is less than the change in
intensity for competitive markets (high n) as predicted.
Proposition 3: Reducing marginal and average reimbursement reduces intensity of care.
This proposition is fairly intuitive and can be derived easily from the total derivative of the first
order condition:

15

Motivated by these propositions we expect to see the following patterns in our data:
1. Less concentrated (or more competitive markets) have higher intensity of care (and
consequently, higher costs)
2. Because IPS lowered both average and marginal reimbursement we expect to see a
decrease in intensity of care for all markets.
3. Because the effects of changes in marginal reimbursement are magnified in markets with
more competition we expect to see a greater decrease in intensity of care (and costs)
following the IPS in more competitive markets. This implies a convergence in the costs
or intensity of care in more versus less competitive markets after the reform.
One caveat is that we treat the number of firms in our model as fixed for simplicity – that is we
do not model firm entry or exit. In reality, the effects of IPS on firm entry and exit may vary by
the level of competition. For example, reducing payment will affect firms with already slim
profit margins the most. If payments are reduced such that a firm accrues a sufficient loss, they
may choose to exit the market. If firms in more competitive markets are operating at higher
levels of intensity their profit margins are likely to smaller and thus we might expect more exit
after IPS in more competitive markets. By similar logic, firm exit might be more pronounced for
“high cost” firms that are less efficient and cannot withstand a decline in reimbursement.
16

Although, we do not model firm exit in our theoretical model, we do explore it in our empirical
models.
Another caveat is that the model is silent on the effects of competition on patient outcomes. The
model predicts changes in intensity of care only and not patient outcomes. On the one hand, one
can argue that if patients value intensity it must improve patient outcomes. However, on the
other hand one can argue that patients might be uninformed and even though they value higher
intensity care, beyond a certain level, changes in intensity of care do not improve patient
outcomes and represent “wasteful” spending. Thus, in our empirical models we will evaluate
both changes in intensity of care and also changes in patient outcomes.

4. Data
4.1.Home Health Payments, Costs, and Days
The primary source of data for this paper comes from a 100 percent sample of Medicare
claims from the Medicare standard analytic file (SAF) for home health care. We restrict the
sample to individuals who were discharged from an acute care hospital for stroke1 between 1996
and 2000. We use the Medicare claims to obtain the total number of days that beneficiaries
received home health visits and total Medicare payments for home health during the 90-day postacute period following each individual’s initial hospital discharge. Any additional acute hospital
stay occurring within the 90-day follow-up period is considered a readmission.

1

Stroke patients are defined as those with a principal diagnosis in the acute hospital stay of intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICD code is 431.xx), occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries with infarction (433.x1), occlusion
of cerebral arteries with infarction (434.x1), or acute but ill-deﬁned cerebrovascular disease (436.xx).

17

Costs to home health providers are computed using data on facility costs from Medicare cost
reports. To construct total costs for each 90-day post-acute episode, we multiply the number of
visits from the claims data by the facility’s average calendar year cost per visit.
4.2.Patient and Provider Characteristics
We use the Medicare denominator file to obtain demographic variables for each individual
including gender, age (5-year age categories), race, Medicaid coverage, county of residence, and
urban/rural status, as well as information about whether death occurred within 90 days of the
initial hospital discharge. We use the hospital claims from the initial acute episode to measure
comorbidities, as defined by Elixhauser, Steiner et al. (1998), and complications during the index
hospitalization. The comorbidities and complications that are included as controls in our
analysis are listed in Table 1. We also use the hospital claims to determine whether the stroke
was hemorrhagic or ischemic.
Provider characteristics for the acute care hospital are derived from the CMS Medicare
Provider of Services file and Acute Impact file. These provider-level databases include
information about ownership status, number of beds, wage index, average daily census, acute
case-mix index, DSH patient share, and Medicare patient share.
4.3.Market Competition
The empirical analysis compares changes in home health use and costs across areas with
high and low levels of competition. Our primary measure of the level of competition in the
market is the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI). We define markets using Hospital Service
Areas (HSA) as defined by the National Center for Health Statistics (M Makuc, Haglund et al.
1991, Wennberg and Cooper 1996, National Cancer Institute 2008). An HSA is defined as a
18

group of zip codes in which the residents receive the majority of their hospitalizations. Since
home health care is typically received after a hospitalization we believe that the market definition
for hospitals is a good approximation of the market for home health care. The HHI is the sum of
the squared market shares for home health providers within each HSA. Each home health
agency’s market share is defined as the proportion of Medicare patients residing in the HSA who
receive post-acute care (during the 90-days following their hospitalization for stroke) from that
home health agency. We also compute the Four-Firm Concentration Ratio as the sum of the
market shares for the four most dominant home health agencies within an HSA as a secondary
measure of competition. We exclude small HSAs from our analysis sample that contain fewer
than 28 home health claims (representing the bottom 25 percent of HSAs) where it is difficult to
obtain a precise measure of competition. In some specifications, we examine firm exit and
define a home health agency as exiting the Medicare market when there are no longer any
Medicare claims for that provider. Figure 1 shows that HHI and the Four-Firm Concentration
Ratio vary greatly across the home health industry; we will use this variation to study the
differential effect of payment reform across more and less competitive markets.
4.4.Sample Restrictions
We exclude individuals who died during the initial hospital stay for stroke. We also exclude
individuals under age 65, those enrolled in Medicare managed care plans, and those residing in
Maryland since Maryland did not adopt prospective payment. We conduct our analysis at the
discharge level and observe outcomes for a 90-day follow-up period. Our main analysis sample
contains 1,178,430 post-acute episodes resulting from 1,178,430 unique stroke discharges over
the study period.
5. Empirical Strategy
19

5.1. Primary specification
We perform OLS regression of home health outcomes on the level of competition
interacted with a post-IPS indicator and controls taking the form:

where Yijt is an outcome such as the number of home health days, provider costs, or the
probability of any home health care for patient i in market j discharged in quarter t.

is a
is the

baseline HHI in market j in the quarter prior to the introduction of IPS. In some specifications,
we include indicators for HHI quantiles rather than a continuous measure of HHI. HHI Quantile
1 refers to the lowest quantile of HHI (i.e. highest level of competition). We also control for
quarter fixed effects (

and market level characteristics

and time-varying patient level characteristics

. The key coefficient of interest is . Since the IPS has an

overall negative effect on outcomes, we predict that

will be positive since less competitive

markets (high HHI) will experience smaller negative effects from IPS (Proposition 2). Standard
errors are clustered at the market-level (HSA).
5.2. Robustness checks
Event study estimates
We estimate an event study version of the primary specification where we add in
interactions of HHI with each quarter leading up to and following the introduction of IPS. The
omitted interaction term is the quarter before IPS is introduced (quarter 3 of 1997) We expect
the coefficients on the interaction terms for the quarters leading up to the IPS to be statistically

20

insignificant, implying that pre-IPS trends in outcomes were similar in more versus less
competitive markets. We expect the coefficients on the interaction terms for the quarters after
IPS to be positive and significant suggesting that IPS had smaller negative effects in less
competitive markets.
Urban-Rural
Prior research and our data suggest that the level of competition in a market is strongly
correlated with the market’s status as urban or rural. More densely populated urban markets are
likely to be more competitive while rural areas have a more dispersed population and are
therefore more likely to be non-competitive. An analysis of changes in health outcomes after
payment reform based on levels of competition could actually be capturing the difference in
responsiveness between urban and rural markets. To test for this, we run our analysis for both
urban and rural areas separately.
Geographic variation in average reimbursement change
The method of payment reform instituted by the IPS imposed varying levels of
reimbursement reductions for home health agencies depending on how long they had been in the
market and the census averages of costs for their district. Firms that entered the market after
1994 were subject to a maximum per patient reimbursement of 105% of the national median in
1994. Agencies that had entered the market before 1994 were subject to a weighted average of
the firm’s average per patient costs in 1994 and the firm’s census division weighted average of
per patient costs. Because of this, agencies in some census regions faced a larger reduction in
reimbursement limits than others, which could affect their responses to the reform. To account
for this, we introduce a measure, IPS “Bite”. In a similar spirit as McKnight (2006), IPS Bite is

21

defined as the average number of home health days in a HSA less the average number of home
health days in the HSA’s census division. HSAs with a higher deviation from the average census
region home health days are likely to be areas where IPS reduced payment the most. We plot
how IPS “Bite” varies with HHI to determine whether there is a systematic relationship between
the payment reduction and the level of competition in the market. We then control for the IPS
“Bite” by including a triple-interaction term between post-IPS, HHI and IPS “Bite”.
5.3. Mechanisms
In addition to characterizing the heterogeneous effects of payment reform by level of
competition, we also want to understand the underlying mechanisms driving these differences.
As discussed in the theoretical framework section, home health agencies may respond to
payment reform by reducing the intensity of care or by exiting the market. We study each of
these mechanisms.
First, we estimate equation 6 using the number of home health providers as the outcome
variable. We also estimate models defining the outcome variable as the log number of providers.
Changes in the number of home health agencies could be driven both by reductions in entry and
an increased rate of exit.
Next, we compare the characteristics of exiting home health agencies (agencies that were
in operation in 1996 but exited after IPS) with “stayer” home health agencies (agencies that were
operating during the entire study period from 1996-2000), in order to identify changes in agency
composition after the IPS that may have affected practice patterns. Specifically, we look at
average home health days, Medicare payments, provider costs, and the demographic
characteristics of patients seen by agencies.

22

In the third set of analyses, we directly investigate how much of the effect of the IPS
occurred through a changing composition of home health agencies. Specifically, we estimate
equation 6 for the home health days and provider costs outcomes, limiting the sample to just the
agencies that stayed in the sample after IPS and compare the results to those for the full sample.
Any differences in results between the two samples are driven by changes in agency composition
due to exiting firms.
6. Results
6.1. Differential effects of IPS by level of competition
Figure 3 and Table 2 test a primary hypothesis generated by the conceptual model: that
the IPS would have a greater impact on intensity of care (measured by the number of days of
home health care) and costs in more competitive markets. Figure 3 shows reductions in average
home health days, costs, and the probability of using home health across HSAs with different
levels of competition during the period following the introduction of IPS but before the
implementation of PPS (the introduction of IPS is indicated by a red vertical line after the third
quarter of 1997). Consistent with the theoretical model and prior literature, the most competitive
markets (HHI quantile 1) exhibit both the highest costs and days under cost-based
reimbursement prior to the IPS and the largest reductions in costs and days after the IPS,
converging towards the other HHI quartiles in the post-reform period. Figure 1 in the appendix
shows the corresponding figure for two important patient outcomes: readmissions and mortality.
In contrast to the results for intensity of care and costs we find little or no impact of the IPS on
these outcomes and we find no differential effects by the level of competition. These results are
consistent with (Huckfeldt, Sood et al. 2014) who also found large changes in costs but no
change in patient outcomes after the IPS.
23

Table 2 displays the results from the analogous regressions for home health days
(columns 1-4), provider costs (columns 5-8), and probability of any home health use (columns 912) on the interaction of HHI quantiles with a “post-IPS” indicator variable. The omitted
quantile is the least competitive HSAs (HHI quantile 4). We show results from four
specifications that progressively add controls: the first includes just HSA fixed effects, the
second adds a linear time trend, the third replaces the linear time trend with quarter-year fixed
effects, and the fourth specification adds time-varying patient and market-level controls. The
first two specifications for each outcome include a “Post-IPS” indicator variable, which exhibits
the change in outcome for the least competitive markets (the omitted interaction category). For
home health days, we observe the largest reductions for the most competitive markets, where
home heath days fell by about 2.4 more days than the least competitive markets, and fell 1.5
more days more than the second quantile. The reduction in home health days after the IPS for the
third quantile was not statistically different from the fourth quantile. These results are robust
across the four specifications. We find similar results for provider costs. All quantiles
experienced a decline in costs, with home health agencies in the most competitive quantiles
seeing a decline in costs of $220 more per patient than in the least competitive quantile. Home
health agencies in the second quantile experienced an additional reduction of $80-$90 in costs
than agencies in the least competitive quantile. In total, provider costs were reduced by
approximately $320 for the first quantile of HHI and by about $200 for the second quantile of
HHI (column 6). We find no significant difference between the reduction in provider costs for
the third and fourth quantiles. Although there was an overall reduction in the probability of using
any home health care, we do not find any statistically significant differences in the magnitude of
the reduction across different levels of competition. In Appendix Table 1, we re-estimate all of

24

these regressions to estimate proportional changes using log outcomes. The results are
qualitatively similar.
6.2. Alternative specifications
Event study
In Table 3, we estimate a regression that includes leads and lags of the policy to ensure
that our findings in Table 2 are not driven by differential trends in outcomes in the pre-IPS
period. We find no evidence of differences in trends by level of competition in the pre-IPS
period and only observe significant differences in the trends by different levels of competition
immediately after the implementation of IPS.
Results stratified by urban status
Our data and prior research suggests that the level of competition might be correlated
with urban/rural status, and thus the results could be related to other unobserved differences
between urban and rural areas rather than competition. To investigate this, we re-estimate the
main analysis separately for urban and non-urban HSAs (results shown in Table 4). To
categorize our data into urban and non-urban groups we use data from NCHS. Table 4 shows
that urban and non-urban areas exhibit patterns that are similar to the pooled sample in Table 2 –
in both urban and non-urban areas the IPS had larger negative effects on costs and days in more
competitive markets.
Heterogeneous effects by IPS “Bite”
The IPS reduced reimbursement by different amounts for home health agencies
depending on how long the firm has been in the market, as well as their average costs and census

25

division costs. To account for this difference in reimbursement changes across HSAs, we
introduce a measure called IPS “bite” which is the difference between the HSA’s average
number of home health days and the census division’s average number of home health days. This
measure predicts how much of an impact IPS may have had on reimbursement. Figure 4 shows
the relationship between HHI and IPS “bite”. There is a slight negative correlation meaning that
a larger reduction in payment is associated with more competitive HSAs. This suggests that IPS
“bite” could be confounding our results.
We account for the geographic heterogeneity of IPS payment reductions in Table 5 by
including an interaction between Post-IPS and IPS-bite, and a triple-interaction between HHI
Quantile, Post-IPS, and IPS bite. We find that the coefficient on the interaction between Post-IPS
and IPS-bite is negative and significant. This is consistent with prior research which also finds
that the IPS led to larger declines in costs in areas with larger bite.(McKnight 2006, Huckfeldt,
Sood et al. 2014) We find that after controlling for the IPS bite, the differential effect for the
most competitive markets is reduced slightly. Home health days are reduced by approximately
1 day more for markets in the first quantile of HHI compared to the fourth quantile (columns 2
and 3) relative to the 2.5 day reduction that we estimate without controlling for IPS bite (column
1). Similarly, including the IPS “bite” interactions reduces the magnitude of the difference in
reduction of provider costs between quantile 1 and quantile 4 to approximately $130 (columns 5
and 6) rather than $220 (column 4). While this does affect the magnitude of the effect of
competition it does not change our overall result that competition amplifies the impact of the
payment change. Finally, we find that the coefficients on the triple interaction between HHI
Quantile, Post-IPS, and IPS bite are statistically insignificant suggesting that IPS bite or average
reimbursement changes do not affect how competition mediates the impact of IPS on costs.
26

6.3. Mechanisms through which competition amplifies effect of IPS
Market exit
We find substantial evidence that the IPS response varied with the level of market
competition. In our conceptual model, we exclude firm decisions regarding entry and exit for
brevity and simplicity when in reality our results could be caused by both internal changes to
cost and admission policies and market exit by firms who incur higher costs and more home
health days. Next, we explore the extent of the role of entry and exit in our findings. Figure 5
shows the trends in the number of home health providers by level of competition. HSAs in the
most competitive quantile experienced the largest reduction in the number of home health
agencies after IPS while the other quantiles appear to have experienced much smaller reductions.
Table 6 Panel A shows estimates from regressing the number of home health providers on the
same variables and controls used in Table 2. In addition, we show results separately by urban/
non-urban status and results that control for IPS bite (columns 5-7). We find progressively
greater reductions in the number of HH providers after IPS as the level of competition increases.
Compared to the lowest competition markets (quantile 4), markets in the third competition
quantile lost approximately 0.5 more agencies, markets in the second quantile lost 1.2 to 1.5
more agencies, and the most competitive markets lost about 5.5 to 6 additional agencies. In total,
the number of agencies in the most competitive markets fell by 4.4 agencies compared to an
increase of 1.6 agencies in the least competitive markets (based on column 2). Comparing urban
and non-urban HSAs in columns 5 and 6, we find that the number of agencies in competitive
markets in urban areas fell more than in non-urban competitive markets, however we find the
same general pattern across competition levels for both categories. Including the IPS bite
interaction terms attenuated the estimates slightly but did not change the pattern by competition
27

levels. In Panel B we estimate log effects, regressing the log of the number of providers on the
same variables in Panel A. The log effects results follow the same pattern as Panel A; we find
that markets in the first quantile experience a 13.7% greater decrease in the number of providers
after IPS than markets in the fourth quantile and similar results for the other specifications
including IPS “bite” and urban and non-urban comparisons.
Changing composition of home health agencies in the sample
The results in Table 6 show that reductions in the number of home health agencies after
the IPS were greater in more competitive markets. Table 7 displays characteristics of staying
firms and exiting firms in markets with high and low competition. In non-competitive HSAs
(columns 3 and 4) there is very little difference in baseline year characteristics between exiting
and staying firms. In the most competitive HSAs (columns 1 and 2) we find larger differences,
with exiting firms having about 8 more home health days and $500 more in Medicare payments
and costs than staying firms in the baseline year (1996). Although exiting agencies provided
more home health days and incurred higher costs, there is almost no difference in 90-day
mortality and rehospitalization rates suggesting that exiting firms may have over-provided care
intensity (as measured by days). These results suggest that payment reform is more likely to
induce inefficient firms to exit the market when they are operating in high competition markets.
In Table 8 we show results from repeating our preferred specification (specification 4)
from Table 2, excluding firms that exited the market after IPS was introduced. Excluding exiting
firms attenuates the extra reduction in home health days in the most competitive markets, from a
reduction of about 4 days receiving home health to a 2.4 day reduction (columns 1 and 2). Once
we control for IPS bite, the estimates become attenuated and insignificant (column 4). This result
implies that much of the difference in the reduction of home health days we found across levels
28

of competition is likely due to home health agency exit rather than changes in internal structure.
For provider costs, we also find a progressive attenuation in the estimates as the sample is
limited to agencies staying in the market and when we include the IPS bite interaction terms.
However, the extra reduction in the most competitive markets after IPS remains statistically
significant (column 8). This result suggests that market exit plays an important role in reducing
costs.
7. Conclusion
Cost-based payment of health care providers has been widely acknowledged as a driver
of over-use of health care and the growth of health care costs in the US. Competition has been
acknowledged to exacerbate this problem, with providers in more competitive markets attracting
patients by providing more services and amenities, generating geographic variation in costs. The
effects of reforms that shift provider payment away from fee-for-service towards more capitated
models may also vary depending on the level of market competition. We develop a theoretical
model generating predictions that reducing marginal reimbursement will have a greater effect on
the intensity of care and costs in more competitive markets. Our empirical results are consistent
with this prediction, with larger reductions after the IPS in the probability of receiving home
health care and the intensity of care in more competitive markets, leading to convergence in costs
in more and less competitive markets. We do not find a similar convergence in patient outcomes
suggesting that the reduction in costs might have improved efficiency. We also find a larger
reduction in the number of home health agencies in more competitive markets and that exiting
providers were more likely to provide high-intensity and high-cost care. Further, much of the
reduction in more competitive markets comes from the exit of such providers.

29

These results imply that to the extent that current health care cost variation (for example
in post-acute costs) was driven by competition under cost-based reimbursement and now the
separate post-acute prospective payment systems, then higher-powered payment systems such as
accountable care organizations and bundled payment that further reduce marginal payments
could lead to greater convergence in costs across markets.

Appendix
Appendix: Altruism Model
Although there is evidence that many not-for-profit health care organizations behave as profit
maximizing firms, we include a model that takes into account the altruistic behavior that may be
displayed by not-for-profit home health agencies. To account for this, we include the value the
firm gets from providing services to patients as a fraction of the value the consumers get,
, where B is the total benefit patients receive from home care (the consumer
surplus) and θ is a number between zero and one. To calculate the patient benefit, we integrate
over the utility of patients for receiving care:

Differentiating with respect to quality gives:

There are two components that make up the change in patient benefit from a change in quality,
the first part,

, is the utility gained from all the existing patients experiencing

increased quality, this is the inframarginal effect. The second part is a marginal effect from the
new patients an increase in quality draws in. This marginal effect is dependent only upon H type
customer utility, this is because the “switchers” have a strictly positive net increase in utility
from treatment while the marginal L type consumers have a utility increase of zero at the margin.
We add in the altruistic value of patient benefit that the home health firm receives, (6), into the
firm’s utility function:

46

With the first order condition for intensity allocation being:

We substitute equations (3) and (7) into (8) and set qi=q j to solve for optimum intensity q*. The
total differentiation of equation (8) that is used to estimate how intensity changes with the
number of firms in the market and with changes to marginal and average reimbursement
becomes:

We find that intensity of care increases with the number of firms only for certain θ:

47

If a firm is above a certain threshold altruism level the sign is negative. Otherwise for modest
levels of altruism we find the same result as for a profit maximizing firm. The threshold level of
altruism is:

For a profit maximizing firm, we found that intensity of care increased as the number of firms in
the market increased due to increased competition. Although this result applies to altruistic firms
up to the altruistic threshold, very altruistic firms are predicted to actually decrease quality as the
number of firms increases. In the profit maximizing case, we obtained the a positive relationship
due to the fact that when the number of firms increased, the demand for each firm decreases, this
lower demand increases marginal profits which makes it more profitable to increase intensity of
care in order to attract more patients. Altruistic firms a have a second effect coming into play.
Because they value the patient benefit, lower demand from an increase in firms also lowers the
marginal patient benefit for high intensity of care giving the hospital less incentive to increase
intensity of care. At high enough levels of altruism, this lowered patient benefit effect
overshadows the increased marginal profit effect and firms actually decrease quality.
Our estimates of how intensity of care changes with the marginal and average reimbursement
remain unchanged in sign, as payments increase (decrease) intensity of care increases
(decreases).
Introducing the parameter, θ, lets us analyze the effect of changes in the level of altruism have on
intensity:

48

Although quality responsiveness to market competition is lowered by altruism, overall altruism
leads to higher quality due to the value firms place on patient wellbeing. Altruistic firms are
willing to forgo profits in order to provide higher quality and provide higher levels of
equilibrium quality than do profit maximizing firms with the same level of reimbursement.
Including altruism in our analysis leads to the same results as profit maximizing firms except for
at high levels of altruism. Because there is evidence that not-for-profit hospitals behave similarly
to for-profit hospitals, we use the simpler profit maximizing model.
