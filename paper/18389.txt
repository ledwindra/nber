The Supply of and Demand for Charitable Donations to Higher Education

NBER Working Paper No. 18389
September 2012
JEL No. H41,I2,I22,I23
ABSTRACT
Charitable donations are an important revenue source for many institutions of higher education. We
explore how donations respond to economic and financial market shocks, accounting for both supply
and demand channels through which these shocks operate. In panel data with fixed effects to control
for unobservable differences across universities, we find that overall donations to higher education
– and especially capital donations for university endowments or for buildings– are positively and significantly
correlated with the average income and house values in the state where the university is located (supply
effects). We also find that when a university suffers a negative endowment shock that is large relative
to its operating budget, donations increase (demand effects). This is especially true for donations earmarked
for current use. We conclude by discussing the importance of understanding how donations respond
to economic shocks for effective financial risk management by colleges and universities.

Charitable donations are an important source of funding for higher education, equaling
6.5% of total university and college spending in 2011. 1 For research/doctoral institutions,
donations are even more important, equaling 10.5% of total spending. Roughly speaking, these
donations are split between current-use gifts, which can be spent immediately, and capital gifts,
which are used for buildings or added to the university’s endowment fund. Payouts from these
endowments, which are themselves the result of past donations, are also an important source of
funding, equaling an additional 5.2% of research/doctoral universities’ total spending (see Brown
et al. 2012).
Given the importance of donations to university budgets, effective financial management
of a university requires understanding the expected size of donations and how donations are
correlated with other revenues and with expenditure needs. When universities are exposed to a
broad economic downturn – such as the recent financial crisis and Great Recession – many of
their revenue sources suffer simultaneous shocks. For example, during an economic downturn,
endowment-dependent universities suffer reductions in endowment payouts, state universities
may need to absorb a reduction in appropriations due to fiscal pressure on the state, and there
may also be public pressure to keep tuition low. Thus, the relation between charitable donations
and economic shocks is important for understanding whether donations help to hedge, or, in
contrast, exacerbate, the volatility of a university’s revenues.
Of course, the same economic forces that affect other revenue sources to a university may
also have a direct effect on donations. Indeed, we posit that there are two potentially offsetting
effects that are important to disentangle. On the supply side, potential donors (e.g., alumni,
corporations, etc.) may suffer a reduced capacity to give during bad economic times. Assuming
that donations to a university are a normal good for donors, we would expect donations to fall

when donors’ incomes and asset values decline. On the other hand, the demand for donations
increases during an economic downturn, as universities seek to maintain their operations in the
face of declining resources from other sources. In essence, the marginal value of a donated
dollar – especially a dollar that can be used for current spending – increases during bad economic
times.
It is quite difficult to disentangle these two offsetting effects using only cross-sectional or
aggregate time series data. In this paper, we attempt to separately identify these effects in panel
data by using plausibly exogenous sources of variation on both the supply and demand side of
the donations market, while controlling for university fixed effects. On the supply side, we
proxy for potential donors’ resources by using state-level measures of average income, house
values, and the equity returns of firms headquartered in the same state as the university. On the
demand side, we use shocks to a university’s endowment as a measure of a university’s demand
for donations. Specifically, we construct a measure of endowment shocks that weights
endowment returns by the size of the endowment relative to total university costs. In addition to
university fixed effects, we also use region-by-Carnegie classification fixed effects to control for
a wide range of both observable and unobservable characteristics that might otherwise lead to
spurious correlations.
Our results indicate that both supply and demand side factors are important determinants
of charitable giving to higher education. On the supply side, we find that overall giving to higher
education institutions is positively and significantly correlated with per capita income, the
returns of local stocks, and house values. Put simply, when donors are doing better financially,
they donate more to higher education. On the demand side, we find that when a university
suffers an endowment shock, donors respond by increasing donations to the school. Importantly,

2

we show that it is not endowment returns that matter, as returns might be correlated with donors’
economic well-being in a way that may not be controlled for by our supply-side variables.
Rather, consistent with a measure of a university’s demand for donations, it is the return
weighted by the size of the endowment shock relative to the university’s total costs that has a
significant effect.
Additional supporting evidence comes from separately examining capital donations
versus current-use donations. We find that capital donations – for which use of the funds is longterm and typically more restricted – are more responsive to our proxies for donor ability (i.e.,
income and house prices). In contrast, current-use donations (which are more highly valued by
universities during an economic downturn as a substitute for other declining resources) are much
more responsive to endowment shocks. In other words, when a university suffers a negative
endowment shock, which in turn leads to a decline in contemporaneous endowment payouts to
the university (see Brown, et al. 2012), donors respond to the need for immediate resources by
directing gifts toward current use. Interestingly, these gifts do not appear to come at the expense
of capital donations, at least after conditioning on the same set of covariates.
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 provides background on donations to universities
and reviews the literature. Section 2 introduces the data and explains the empirical strategy.
Section 3 presents and discusses the empirical results. Section 4 concludes.

1. Background and Literature Review
Educational institutions are the second largest recipients of charitable donations in the United
States, second only to religious institutions. In 2011, it is estimated that individuals and
corporations donated $39 billion to educational institutions, which is about 13% of all charitable

3

donations to any cause. 2 As with other charitable giving, donations to higher education are
generally tax deductible, 3 and thus gifts to colleges and universities represent a significant “tax
expenditure” for the federal treasury.
Charitable donations to a university can take the form of current-use gifts or capital gifts.
Current-use gifts can be fully spent in the year received or according to the schedule provided by
the donor. Capital gifts are for the university’s long-term use, and come in two major types: gifts
for buildings and gifts to the university’s endowment funds. In the latter case, the investment
income generated by the endowment provides support for the university in perpetuity. As
discussed in Brown et al (2012), endowments have grown enormously in importance for
universities over the past few decades, although there is substantial heterogeneity in the extent to
which universities rely on endowment income. According to our data (which we will discuss in
more detail below), about 48% of donations to universities in the 2008-2009 academic year
($12.4 billion total) were capital gifts, whereas the remaining 52% ($13.2 billion total) were
current use gifts. We will show below that these two types of gifts exhibit differential
sensitivities to the economic environment, a factor that is important for universities to consider
when planning and managing financial risks.
A number of papers have analyzed the determinants of charitable contributions in general,
and contributions to higher education specifically. Due to the tax deductibility of charitable
contributions, a large literature in public finance has examined how marginal tax rates affect
charitable giving (e.g., Auten, Cilke, and Randolph, 1992; Auten, Sieg, and Clotfelter, 2002;
Clotfelter, 2012). Specific to higher education, a number of papers have examined the
2

See http://www.voanews.com/content/us-charitable-donations-near-300-billion/1212970.html.
In general, donations to colleges and universities are deductible from income for those itemizing
expenses on their tax returns at the federal level. However, only 80% of donations made to athletic
departments are deductible: this is Congress’ way of approximating the non-charitable portion of such
gifts (e.g., access to better football tickets).

determinants of overall giving as well as of alumni giving. 4 These papers tend to find that
educational quality and student involvement in campus activities are associated with greater
alumni donations. Further, alumni donations are higher at universities that spend more on
fundraising and at universities that admit students from wealthier families. Other researchers
have focused on carefully identifying the impact on donations of specific factors such as
financial aid granted to alumni when they were students (e.g., Dugan, Mullin, and Siegfried,
2000; Cunningham and Cochi-Ficano, 2002; Meer and Rosen, 2012), the school’s recent athletic
performance (e.g., Rhoads and Gerking, 2000, and cites therein; Meer and Rosen, 2009a), and
self-interested giving (e.g., Butcher, Kearns, and McEwan, 2011; Meer and Rosen 2009b).
The strand of the literature that is most relevant to ours is that examining whether donations
are crowded out by other university resources. Oster (2001) uses the Voluntary Support of
Education (VSE) data to examine whether endowment growth crowds out donations. She finds
evidence of crowding out in the 1999 cross-section, although there are concerns about
identification due to unobserved differences across universities. When she controls for fixed
effects, using panel data from the early 1980s through 1997, she finds no evidence of crowding
out in the early years of her sample, although she continues to find some evidence of crowding
out in later years. Earlier papers (e.g., Roberts, 1984; Kingma, 1989; Steinberg, 1993) also
report small crowding-out effects. Segal and Weisbrod (1998) examine whether donations are
crowded out by commercial revenues, and find the opposite: the two revenue sources tend to
positively co-vary.

Examples include Steinberg (1987); Baade and Sundberg (1996); Harrison, Mitchell, and Peterson
(1995); Shulman and Bowen (2000); Cunningham and Cochi-Ficano (2002); Clotfelter (2003); and
Ehrenberg and Smith (2003).

Our results also relate to the literature on university endowment funds. There is also a small
theoretical literature that considers (among other things) the joint relation of donation risk and
endowment fund risk. Tobin (1974) argues that universities should ignore donation risk when
making endowment decisions. In contrast, Black (1976) and Merton (1992) argue that
universities should hedge donation risk through their portfolio allocations of endowment assets.
Consistent with this hedging argument, Dimmock (2012) shows that universities with greater
volatility of revenues (which include revenues from current use donations) hold less volatile
endowment portfolios.

However, Brown et al (2012) show that universities do not alter

endowment fund payout rates to smooth out fluctuations in other revenues. Although several
studies have shown that at least some endowments appear able to generate alpha (Lerner, Schoar,
and Wang, 2008; Brown, Garlappi, and Tiu, 2010; Barber and Wang, 2011) a factor that could
influence a donor’s decision of whether and when to give, these studies suggest that alpha is
generated by allocations to risky alternative asset classes such as hedge funds, private equity and
venture capital. As shown by Dimmock (2012), the ability of universities to invest in these
alternative asset classes depends, in turn, on the riskiness of the universities’ non-endowment
revenues, such as from donations.
In this paper, we provide new evidence on how broader economic and financial market
shocks affect donations to colleges and universities, taking into account both supply and demand
effects. An important advance over the existing literature on donations is that we are able to
separately identify these supply and demand effects by using plausibly exogenous variation in
the size of the budget shocks faced by universities that result from endowment investment and
payout decisions. Additionally, we use state-level measures of income, house values, and equity
returns to identify the response of donations to economic shocks to likely donors.

2. Data and Empirical Strategy
2.1 Data and Sample
We combine data from multiple sources in this study, so as to create a dataset with
information on university finances, donations, and endowment funds, as well as on economic
shocks. Our data source for university finances is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
System 5 (IPEDS), collected by the National Center for Educational Statistics, a division of the
U.S. Department of Education. IPEDS includes information from each university’s financial
statements, as well as university characteristics such as whether the university is public or
private. Providing information through IPEDS is mandatory for all U.S. post-secondary
institutions, and institutions that fail to provide information are barred from accessing federal
funding and their students are ineligible for federally guaranteed student loans.
Our sources for university endowment fund data are a series of annual surveys produced
by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) and by the
Commonfund. 6 For the period 1997-2008, our endowment data come from the NACUBO
Endowment Survey. Beginning in 2009, NACUBO joined forces with the Commonfund to
produce the NACUBO-Commonfund Endowment Survey, which is our source of endowment
data for the 2008-2009 academic year.
Our source for data on university donations is the Voluntary Support of Education (VSE)
dataset produced by the Council for Aid to Education. 7 The VSE contains detailed information
on charitable contributions to universities, including donation amounts, the purpose of gifts, and

donor type. We merge the IPEDS data, endowment data, and VSE data by hand, matching on
university name.
We use data from two additional sources for some of our measures of economic shocks.
We use state level economic variables from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
produced by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. 8 We also create state level stock return
portfolios using data from the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) and Compustat
databases.

2.2 Variables and Summary Statistics
From the data sources just described, we create the variables summarized in Table 1 (See
Appendix Table 1 for variable definitions.) The summary statistics are pooled over the period
1997-2009, where year indicates the academic year end, i.e., 2009 indicates either values for the
period July 2008 through June 2009 (for flow variables), or values as of June 2009 (for stock
variables). The average university in our sample has total costs of $288.6 million, while the
average endowment fund is $451.9 million. On average, the endowment-to-university cost ratio
of 1.83 across universities during the sample.
The average university in our sample receives donations of $31.2 million per year, equal
to 15% of total costs. 9 Both the time-series and cross-sectional variation in the donations-tocosts ratio are summarized in Figure 1. This figure shows a small overall decline in this ratio
over time; although donations rose over this period, this was more than offset by the increase in
8

See http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/.
In the introduction, we cited figures from the Council for Aid to Education stating that in 2011
aggregate donations to universities totaled 6.5% of aggregate university costs. The ratio of 15%, reported
in Table 1, is equal weighted across all universities in our sample, over the full sample period. The value
weighted average donation-to-cost ratio for the universities in our sample is 8.7% as of 2009 (our most
recent data). Thus, the universities in our sample appear to be slightly more dependent on donations than
the overall population of universities.

university costs. The cross-sectional dispersion in the 2007-2008 period shows that the
proportional decline in giving was greater for universities with higher ratios of donations-to-total
costs. These donations are nearly evenly divided between capital gifts to current-use gifts.
Capital gifts include all gifts that cannot be immediately spent, but instead are intended to
provide ongoing support for the university. 10 Current-use gifts include all gifts that can be
immediately spent by the university. From the VSE data we are also able to see the number of
individual donors that the university solicited for a donation, as well as the number of individuals
who made a donation to the university.
In the lower half of Table 1, we summarize the variables that measure shocks to the
supply of and demand for donations. Changes in per capita income and the housing price index
for the states are both calculated using data from the FRED dataset. The housing price index is
based on data provided by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and is calculated following the
method proposed by Case and Shiller (1989) as described by Calhoun (1996).
Using state headquarter locations from the Compustat database and stock returns from the
CRSP database, we calculate equal and value weighted returns for portfolios composed of all
firms headquartered in each state.
Following Brown, et al. (2012), we define endowment shocks as follows:
Shock i ,t = Return i ,t ×

Endowment Fund Size i ,t −1
Total University Costs i ,t −1

(1)

where subscript i denotes the university and subscript t denotes the academic year. This variable
captures the idea that a university with a large endowment-to-cost ratio may be more responsive
to endowment returns than a university with a small endowment-to-cost ratio. For intuition,

10

During our sample period, approximately one-third of capital gifts were gifts for the construction or
renovation of buildings. The remaining gifts were for endowment funds.
9

consider the extremes: a university that relies on endowment income to cover the majority of its
expenses would likely respond to a given percentage return differently from a university whose
endowment is a trivial share of its expenses. In essence, this means that there is variation in the
“shock” variable arising from both the rate of return realized by the endowment and the size of
the endowment relative to university costs. One can also think of the “shock” variable as the
ratio of the change in the dollar value of the endowment attributable to its performance to the
dollar flow of university expenditures.

2.3 Empirical Strategy
Our primary dependent variable is the log of total donations, although in some
specifications we also separately examine current-use donations and capital donations. In our
analysis we include measures of both supply and demand side determinants of donations, and we
make use of the panel structure of the data to control for both university and year-by-Carnegie
classification fixed effects.
Our basic empirical specification is as follows:
ln�𝐷𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖,𝑡 � = 𝛽1 ∙ ln�𝐴𝑣𝑔 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠,𝑡 � + 𝛽2 ∙ ln�𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠,𝑡 �
+ 𝛽3 ∙ 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠,𝑡 + 𝛽4 ∙ 𝐸𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡
+ 𝛽5 ∙ 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝛿𝑐,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡

(2)

The dependent variable is the log of donation to university i in year t. The first set of

explanatory variables are meant to proxy for the impact of the economy on donor’s ability to
contribute, and includes the log of average state income, log average state house price, and
average in-state stock return for state s in year t. The endowment shock variable measures the
size of the endowment’s return shock relative to the size of the university’s operating budget. X
is a vector of other control variables. µi represents university fixed effects, and δc,t represents
10

Carnegie classification-by-year fixed effects. 11 εi,t is a mean-zero error term. Because we use a
log-log specification for most variables, we can interpret the coefficients as elasticities.

3. Results
3.1 Baseline Results
We begin our analysis in Table 2 by implementing the above-specification. Looking first
at the factors affecting the supply of donations, the significant coefficient of 0.52 on average
state income implies that a 10% increase in average income in the university’s home state
increases donations to the university by about 5.2%. We also find that a 10% increase in home
values in the state is associated with a 1.3% increase in donations to the university. Additionally,
we also test the relation between donations and the returns of in-state companies. Our inclusion
of this variable is motivated by the large literature indicating the prevalence of a local geographic
“home bias” in individual investor portfolios (e.g., Ivković and Weisbenner, 2005). 12 We find
that donations respond to the equally-weighted average return of stocks that are headquartered in
the state: a 10 percentage point increase in the return of in-state companies increases giving by
0.7%, a small but statistically significant effect. Taken together, these results support the
intuitive hypothesis that university donations rise and fall with the economic well-being of their
likely contributors (i.e., home-state residents).
We then turn to an analysis of the demand side by focusing on the endowment shock
variable. We find that when a university suffers a negative shock that is equivalent to losing

11

For more information on Carnegie classifications, see http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/.
We have also constructed alternative measures of average income, home values, and local equity
returns that account for the variation in students’ state-of-origin. In these alternative measures, each
university’s shock variable is a weighted average of state shocks, where the weights are equal to the
percentage of the university’s alumni who were originally from that state. We find extremely similar
results for all specifications, and thus we report only the state-level results in the interest of space.
12

11

10% of one year’s operating budget (i.e., Shock = -0.10), donors respond by increasing donations
by 0.2%. This effect is significant at the 10% level, although its economic magnitude is
relatively small. Our preferred interpretation of this finding is that donors respond to the
increased need of the university, either on their own or through targeted efforts on the part of the
university. We will explore these ideas in more detail below. The results in Table 2 also show
that donations to the university are unrelated to the level of state appropriations to the university.
Column (2) repeats the specification from column (1), but replaces the equal-weighted instate stock returns with value-weighted in-state stock returns. The results are virtually the same
as column (1). In column (3), we also add a control for the state’s population; the coefficient for
this variable is insignificant. This is, perhaps, not surprising given that we include university
fixed effects, which effectively function as state fixed effects because universities do not move
across state lines. This, combined with year fixed effects, means that the log of population
would only control for differential population growth trends across states, but the results suggest
that any such differential trends are uncorrelated with donations.
The coefficient on the endowment shock variable is quite stable in columns (1), (2) and (3),
with significance just above the 10% level. As discussed above, we believe that this shock
variable – which weights endowment returns by the importance of the endowment to university
operations – is a useful proxy for the relative need of a university for additional resources (see
Brown et al. 2012, for evidence that endowment shocks have real effects on university
operations). To ensure that endowment returns only matter insofar as they affect the university’s
budget, in column (4) we replace our shock variable with a simple measure of endowment
returns. The coefficient on endowment returns is quite small and statistically insignificant. This

12

is comforting, as it confirms that it is our return-measure that accounts for the endowment’s
importance to the university that is significantly correlated with donations to the university.
Although our specifications above control for an institution’s Carnegie classification
(and, indeed, interact this classification of the university with year effects), in column (5) we
restrict the sample to the subset of doctoral institutions, a group for which endowments and
donations play a particularly important role. The effects are, again, nearly identical to those from
columns (1) through (3). If anything, the coefficient on the endowment shock variable is slightly
larger than before (although, statistically different from zero, it is not statistically different from
the prior specifications).
Overall, the results from Table 2 suggest that donations rise with the economic wellbeing of the individuals in the state where the university is located (or, alternatively, the states
from which many students likely originated). In addition, donations also rise with university
need, as proxied by the endowment shock variable. This suggests that macro-economic shocks
affect university donations through both supply and demand channels, although our estimates
suggest that the supply channel is quantitatively more important.

3.2 Capital Donations versus Current-Use Donations
As noted earlier, donations to universities can be designated for current use or for capital
purposes (buildings or the endowment fund), and it is natural to expect that these types of
donations may respond differently to economic shocks. Specifically, we expect that during a
financial crisis universities’ prefer current-use donations. Current-use gifts are particularly
valuable during financial crises, because they can be entirely spent in the current period, when

13

the marginal utility of spending is very high. Capital gifts, in contrast, must are consumed over
many future periods, in which the marginal utility of spending is likely to be lower.
In Table 3, we explore these differences. The first column is for comparison purposes
only – it is simply a replication of column (1) from Table 2, and shows the effect on total
donations. In column (2), we add the logarithm of lagged university costs as an additional
control variable. We add a control for lagged university costs because if donors are sensitive to
the university’s need, they might increase giving in response to higher costs. There is, however,
a potential endogeneity concern in that universities might increase their budgets in anticipation
of higher donations. Because of this concern, we show results both with and without this
additional control variable. The results in column (2) are similar, although the significance of
the coefficient on endowment shocks falls just below the 10% level.
In columns (3) and (4), the dependent variable is the log of donations that are specifically
designated for capital purposes. The effects of average income, house prices, and stock returns
are still significant, and in fact have slightly larger coefficients than in the regression of total
donations. The coefficient on the endowment shock variable is of similar size as in the
regression of total donations, but due to the larger standard error, it is no longer significant (the
p-value drops from approximately 0.1 to 0.3). Thus, it appears that supply-side considerations
(i.e., the resources of donors) are quite relevant for capital gifts and we cannot rule out the
possibility that endowment shocks have no effect on donation levels.
When we turn to donations for current use, in columns (5) and (6), we find that currentuse donations are less responsive to the economic characteristics of the donors, but are
significantly responsive to endowment shocks. A negative endowment shock equal to 10% of a
university’s operating budget increases donations for current use by 0.24 percent. It is worth

14

noting, however, that the magnitudes of the coefficients across the “capital” and “current use”
donations are not significantly different, although the extent to which each is statistically
different from zero does vary across the specifications.
We are unable to distinguish to what extent the differential responsiveness of capital gifts
and current use gifts to endowment shocks is driven by donor perceptions of needs versus the
university’s own efforts to guide donations into certain categories. In all likelihood, both effects
probably matter: the university may try to steer donors towards current use donations, and donors
may be more responsive to the need for current-use funds following an exogenous negative
shock to the university’s finances.
The results in columns (3) – (6) suggest that supply side factors have a stronger effect on
capital donations than on current-use donations. This may reflect a preference among donors for
“legacy” gifts, which allow the donor to attach her name to a building or professorship in
perpetuity. Thus without the active guidance of the university, donors may naturally gravitate
towards capital donations. The greater effect of supply side factors on capital donations may be
related to one of the key differences between current-use and capital donations. Capital
donations tend to be significantly larger and come from fewer donors. Thus, economic shocks
may primarily affect large gifts, rather than smaller donations.
There are two ways in which donations can increase: either the number of donors can
increase or the average amount given per donor can increase. In the remaining columns, we
explore how each of these factors is affected by our explanatory variables. In columns (7) and
(8), the dependent variable is the number of individuals who make a donation, rather than the
aggregate amount given to the university. The results show that increases in local house prices

15

and state stock returns lead to a significant increase in the number of donors. In these
specifications, however, the effect of per capita income is not significant.
In columns (9) and (10), we regress the number of individuals solicited for gifts on the
economic shock variables. None of the results are significant; we fail to find support for the idea
that universities change their solicitation efforts in response to either university need or donors’
ability to give. There are several possible reasons for this finding. First, in all periods, the
university should set the marginal cost of soliciting donations equal to the marginal benefits.
During a financial crisis, the marginal benefit of donations is greater to the university, but the
marginal cost of diverting resources towards fundraising is also greater. These effects may offset
one another. Second, university financial need usually coincides with financial shocks to donors,
and so the marginal benefits to fundraising may be lower because donors are less receptive.
Finally, as readers who are alumni of U.S. institutions may know from personal experience,
many universities solicit virtually all alumni every year. 13 The number of individuals solicited
variable does not reflect the intensity of solicitations (i.e., someone receiving ten solicitations is
counted the same as someone receiving one solicitation), and it may be the intensity of
solicitation, rather than the simple number of individuals contacted, that varies with economic
conditions of the university and its likely donors.

3.3 Allowing for Lagged Effects
There are numerous reasons to think that donation responses to both supply and demand
side factors may operate with a partial lag. For example, donors may plan their charitable
contributions in advance, and universities, in turn, may take time to adjust their solicitation

The median ratio of solicited alumni to total alumni is 0.90, with 36% of universities soliciting greater
than 95% of their alumni each year.

efforts. Thus, in Table 4, we augment our basic specifications with lagged version of all of the
independent variables. For example, in column (1) we use the log of total donations as the
dependent variable, and regress it against contemporaneous and lagged income,
contemporaneous and lagged house values, and so forth. Because the lagged values of the
variables are often correlated with the contemporaneous measures, we examine the F-tests of the
joint significance of each contemporaneous/lagged pair of controls in addition to the statistical
significance of the individual variables. In general, we find that our earlier results hold, and
often have slightly larger cumulative effects. For example, a 10% increase in average income
increases donations in the following year by 6.7%, and the contemporaneous and lagged income
variable are jointly highly significant (p-value of .009). The effect of changes in house prices
remains significant, but the return of the state stock portfolio is no longer significant.
As discussed in Brown et al. (2012), it is especially important to control for lagged values
when analyzing the effect of endowment shocks because university endowments typically follow
payout policies that calculate payouts based upon lagged asset values. Thus endowment shocks
can have lasting effects. Consistent with this, we find a significant relation between lagged
endowment shocks and donations to the university, with the contemporaneous and lagged effects
jointly being highly significant.
As before, when we separate donations into capital gifts (column (2)) versus current-use
gifts (column (3)), we find that income, housing, and the stock returns of in-state companies are
significant predictors of capital gifts, whereas the combined effect of contemporaneous and
lagged endowment shocks is not significant. In contrast, when we focus on current-use gifts, the
income variables remain jointly significant, but the effect of house prices and stock returns are
not significant. As before, a large endowment shock affects the level of current-use donations.

17

Specifically, a negative endowment shock equal to 10% of a university’s budget increases
current-use donations by 0.17% in current year, and by an additional 0.31% in the subsequent
year.

3.4 Asymmetric Effects of Endowment Shocks
In our prior work (Brown et al. 2012), we documented important asymmetries in how
university endowment funds adjust payouts in response to positive versus negative endowment
shocks. Specifically, we found that universities tend to closely follow their spending guidelines
following positive shocks, but actively reduce their payouts below the level specified in their
own payout guidelines following a negative shock.
In Table 5, we explore whether donations also respond asymmetrically to positive versus
negative endowment shocks. In column (1), we do not find a significant effect between
contemporaneous endowment shocks and total donations. However, when we control for lags in
column (2), we find that lagged negative endowment shocks have a significant effect on
university donations. Specifically, in the year after a university experiences a negative shock
equal to 10% of one year’s university budget, donations increase by nearly 1%. In contrast,
donations do not respond to positive shocks, even with a lag, suggesting that individuals do not
stop giving when the university experiences positive shocks, but that they do “step up” and assist
following negative shocks. This finding has important implications for the question of whether
endowment shocks “crowd out” endowment giving (e.g., Oster 2001). We find no evidence to
suggest that positive shocks reduce giving, but there is some evidence that donors help to smooth
the results of negative endowment shocks.

18

In columns (3)-(6), we again separately analyze capital gifts and current-use gifts (both
with and without lags). Summarizing these four columns, we find that the effect of lagged
negative endowment shocks on donations is concentrated in current-use gifts. It is not difficult
to imagine the “sales pitch” that a university would make to donors in this case: “Last year,
through no fault of our own, we suffered a large loss in our endowment. The endowment will be
fine in the long-run (after markets recover), but in the meantime we have an urgent and
immediate need for current-use donations so that we can continue to serve our students.” This
result suggests that donors provide a form of revenue insurance for universities.

4. Conclusions
The evidence presented in this paper suggests that donations to universities are strongly
affected by macroeconomic factors through both supply and demand channels. On the supply
side, donations increase when the economic resources available to donors – personal income,
house values, and equity values – are higher. On the demand side, current-use donations respond
to need: when a university suffers a negative endowment shock, donors respond by opening up
their checkbooks and providing additional funds. Thus, when the economy as a whole suffers a
negative shock (such as the global financial crisis or the Great Recession), these factors partially
offset one another. As donors see their own resources dwindle, they are less likely to donate,
consistent with charitable donations being a normal good. However, this effect is partially
mitigated by the fact that donors appear to respond to the perceived need of the university.
Our findings have implications for the overall financial risk management of a university.
Donations, payouts from endowments, tuition, state appropriations, and other income are all part
of an overall revenue portfolio for the typical university. As with any portfolio management
decision, it is important to consider the co-variances of the different components of the portfolio.
19

Donations positively co-vary with in-state income, home prices, and equity returns, and these
same factors likely affect a university’s ability to raise tuition revenue, obtain public funding,
and so forth. As such, all else equal, a university ought to invest its endowment portfolio in such
a way as to limit further correlations. This would involve, for example, under-weighting the
stocks of in-state companies (and companies in other states from which their student body
comes). Of course, it is unclear whether universities think of their endowments in this way.
Dimmock (2012) shows that endowment asset allocation is significantly related to the standard
deviations of revenues, but fails to find support for the hypothesis that endowment funds
consider the correlations between endowment returns and other revenue sources. Our prior
work (Brown et al. 2012) suggests that universities manage endowment payout rates so as to
maintain the size of the endowment for its own sake, rather than changing payout rates to
provide a form of insurance against bad economic outcomes.
Although the endowments themselves are not invested to provide revenue insurance, our
evidence suggests that donors are willing to play that role. That is, they are willing to donate
more for current use when the university is suffering from economic hard times. Unfortunately,
the effectiveness of donors as a form of insurance is severely limited by the fact that the donors
are themselves subject to the same macroeconomic shocks. For the sake of illustration, consider
the coefficients estimated in column (1) of Table 2 combined with the median values for the
2008-2009 academic year. The direct effect of the median endowment shock in that year implies
an increase in donations of 0.4%. However, this is more than offset by the decrease in personal
income and housing prices as well as the negative returns to the state-stock portfolios, for a net
decrease to donations of 2.6%.

See the Appendix for variable definitions. Dependent variables are in logarithms. “Shock” represents the product of the return on the endowment and the lagged
endowment-to-university-cost ratio (i.e., the fall in endowment value attributed to returns normalized by last year’s university costs). Standard errors, shown in
parentheses, allow for correlations among observations of a given university over time as well as cross-sectional correlations.
