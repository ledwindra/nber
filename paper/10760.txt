ABSTRACT
This article studies optimal fines when an offender's wealth is private information that can be
obtained by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit. I derive the optimal fine for the
underlying offense, the optimal fine for misrepresenting one's wealth level, and the optimal audit
probability. I demonstrate that the optimal fine for misrepresenting wealth equals the fine for the
offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore generally exceeds the fine for the offense. The
optimal audit probability is positive, increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the
cost is sufficiently low. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals
who are capable of paying the fine for the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. I also show
that the optimal fine for the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing wealth
levels.

I. Introduction
Despite the obvious ability of individuals to hide assets (for example, by hoarding cash or
distributing property to relatives or friends), prior analyses of optimal fines nearly universally
assume that an offender’s level of wealth is costlessly observable by the enforcement authority.1
The contribution of this article is to consider optimal fines when an offender’s wealth is private
information that can be obtained by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit.
Obviously, the conventional analysis is a special case of the present analysis, when the audit cost
is zero.
I employ a model in which there is a continuum of individuals with respect to their level
of wealth and their potential benefit from committing an offense. If an individual commits the
offense and is caught, he is sanctioned with a fine. If he claims that he cannot pay the fine, he
may be audited. If the audit determines that he misrepresented his wealth level, he can be fined
for having lied about his wealth. The enforcement authority’s problem is to choose the
probability of detecting the offense, the fine for the offense, the probability of an audit, and the
fine for misrepresentation of wealth so as to maximize social welfare.
Among other things, I demonstrate that the optimal fine for misrepresenting one’s
wealth level equals the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore
generally exceeds the fine for the offense. The optimal audit probability is positive,
increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the cost is sufficiently low.
If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals who are
capable of paying the fine for the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. I also

show that the optimal fine for the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of
auditing wealth levels.
Section II presents the model. Section III derives the optimal fines and audit probability.
Section IV contains some concluding observations about the use of imprisonment to sanction
misrepresentation of wealth and the offense.2

II. Model
In the model, risk-neutral individuals contemplate whether to commit an offense that
causes harm. Each individual is identified by the benefit he would obtain from committing the
offense and by his level of wealth. An individual who commits the offense is detected with some
probability (which is costly for the state to maintain) and fined. If he claims that he cannot pay
the fine because he has insufficient wealth, he may be audited at some cost to the state to
determine his wealth level (audits are assumed to be accurate). If an audit reveals that the
individual misrepresented his wealth level, he may be sanctioned further, by a higher fine. The
fine imposed on an individual, whether for the offense or for misrepresenting his wealth level,
cannot exceed his wealth. Fines are assumed to be socially costless to impose.
The following notation will be used.
h = harm caused if the offense is committed; h > 0;

To my knowledge, this article is the first to analyze optimal fines when the offender’s level of wealth can
be observed by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit. Several studies of related interest should be
mentioned, however. Chu and Jiang (1993) and Levitt (1997) consider the choice between fines and imprisonment
when wealth cannot be discovered by the enforcement authority at any cost (in Chu and Jiang’s case, this
assumption is implicit). Garoupa (1998) investigates optimal fines when the enforcement authority is assumed to
costlessly observe an underestimate of offenders’ wealth levels. See also the discussion of Polinsky (2004) in
section IV below. The large theoretical literature on the auditing of wealth levels in the context of controlling tax
evasion — see Mookherjee (1997, pp. 207-31) and Andreoni, Erard, and Feinstein (1998, pp. 823-35) — is only
tangentially relevant to the analysis here because its focus is on controlling offenses that affect the distribution of

-3-

b = benefit from committing the offense; b $ 0;
r(b) = probability density of b; r(b) is positive for all b $ 0;
w = wealth of an individual; w $ 0;
g(w) = probability density of w; g(w) is positive for all w $ 0;
p = probability of detection;
e(p) = enforcement expenditures of the state; e(0) = 0; e'(p) > 0;
fO = fine for committing the offense; fO $ 0;3
q = probability of an audit; q $ 0;
k = cost to the state of an audit; k > 0; and
fM = fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level; fM $ 0.
The distributions of benefits and of wealth are assumed to be independent and known by
the state. Without loss of generality, I assume that if an offender is found to have misrepresented
his wealth level, the fine fM is imposed instead of the fine fO that otherwise would be applicable.
Behavior of individuals. First consider the decision of an individual who has been caught
committing the offense whether to misrepresent his wealth level w. If he does not do so, he will
pay the fine for the offense fO if w $ fO, and w otherwise. In other words, he will pay min[w, fO].
If he pays w because his wealth is insufficient to pay fO and he is subsequently audited, he will be
found to have not misrepresented his wealth level.
Suppose, however, that the individual does misrepresent his wealth level, claiming he is
only capable of paying wN < fO. If he is not audited, he will pay wN. If he is audited, he will pay
income rather than that cause harm. Thus, for example, much of this literature is concerned with how auditing
policy should be designed and coordinated with tax policy so as to facilitate the raising of revenue.

This is the nominal fine. An individual might not have sufficient wealth to pay this fine. The same
statement applies to the fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level.

-4-

fM if he has sufficient wealth to pay this fine; otherwise he will pay his wealth w. Thus, if he
misrepresents his wealth level, his expected payment is (1 – q)wN + qmin[w, fM]. If an individual
misrepresents his wealth level, he will do so to the greatest extent possible, claiming that he has
no wealth.4 Hence, his expected payment would be qmin[w, fM].
Given the preceding discussion, an individual will misrepresent his wealth level if and
only if5
qmin[w, fM] < min[w, fO].

(1)

Let
w^ = critical level of wealth below which individuals who are detected
committing the offense will misrepresent their wealth levels and at
and above which individuals will not misrepresent their wealth levels.
It can be demonstrated from (1) that
^

fO/q if qfM $ fO

w=
4

if qfM < fO.6

(2)

In other words, if the expected fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level equals or exceeds the
fine for the offense, individuals with wealth less than fO/q will misrepresent their wealth levels

4

This occurs because the fine for misrepresentation is assumed not to depend on the extent of
misrepresentation and the probability of being audited is assumed not to depend on the reported wealth level. The
analysis would be much more complicated if these assumptions were not made, because it would become necessary
to choose the optimal schedules for the fine for misrepresentation and the audit probability, as well as to derive the
behavior of individuals with different levels of wealth in response to these schedules.
5

It is convenient to assume that if an individual is indifferent between misrepresenting his wealth level and
not, he does not misrepresent his wealth level. None of the results depend on this assumption.
6

To prove this requires evaluating (1) in three cases — whether qfM exceeds, equals, or is less than fO.
Because a complete treatment of these cases is tedious, I consider only one here. Suppose that qfM > fO. In this case,
fO < fO/q < fM. If w # fO, (1) becomes qw < w, which clearly holds. If fO < w < fO/q, (1) becomes qw < fO, which
holds because w < fO/q. If fO/q # w < fM, (1) becomes qw < fO, which does not hold because fO/q # w. If w $ fM, (1)
becomes qfM < fO, which does not hold because fO/q < fM. Hence, if qfM > fO, individuals with wealth levels less than
fO/q will misrepresent their wealth levels, while individuals with wealth levels equal to or greater than fO/q will not.

-5-

(claiming to be zero-wealth individuals), while individuals with wealth equal to or greater than
fO/q will pay the fine for the offense fO. Note that if q < 1, there are some individuals who are
capable of paying fO who choose to misrepresent their wealth levels (individuals with wealth
between fO and fO/q).7 If, however, the expected fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level is
less than the fine for the offense, all individuals will misrepresent their wealth levels.
Next consider the decision of an individual whether to commit the offense. Let
b(w) = critical value of benefit below which an individual whose wealth is w will
not commit the offense and at and above which he will.8
Thus, the higher b(w) is, the greater the level of deterrence.
An individual will commit the offense if his benefit equals or exceeds the expected fine
he faces, which depends on whether he will misrepresent his wealth level if he is caught. Since
he will misrepresent his wealth if and only if (1) holds, it follows that the critical value of benefit
is
b(w) = pmin{qmin[w, fM], min[w, fO]}.

(3)

Social welfare. Social welfare is the sum of the benefits obtained by individuals who
commit the offense, less the harm done, less the cost of detection, and less the cost of auditing.
Thus, social welfare is
w^

4

I { I [b - h - pqk]r(b)db}g(w)dw
(4)

0 b(w)
4

4

+ I { I [b - h]r(b)db}g(w)dw - e(p),
w^

b(w)

7

Individuals whose wealth is less than fO obviously will not pay anything because the worst that can
happen to them is that they are audited and lose their wealth.
8

I assume without loss of generality that an individual commits the offense if he is indifferent.

-6-

where b(w) is given by (3) and w^ by (2). The first term in (4) is the contribution to social
welfare associated with individuals with relatively low levels of wealth (less than w^ ) who
misrepresent their wealth levels and do not pay the fine for the offense fO. Every individual in
this group whose benefit equals or exceeds b(w) commits the offense, resulting in a benefit b, a
harm h, and an expected auditing cost of pqk. The second term is the contribution to social
welfare associated with relatively high-wealth individuals who pay the fine for the offense fO.
The state also incurs enforcement expenditures e.
The state’s problem. The state’s problem is to maximize social welfare through the
choice of the probability of detection p, the fine for the offense fO, the audit probability q, and the
fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level fM.9 The fines actually paid by individuals cannot
exceed their levels of wealth. Asterisks will be used to denote the solution to the state’s
problem, which I assume is unique.
Because the choice of the optimal probability of detection p* does not bear in any
interesting way on the analysis of optimal fines and auditing, I will not analyze the choice of p*
below. However, I assume that some enforcement is optimal, that is, p* > 0; otherwise, the
problem is uninteresting.

III. Analysis
In this section I describe the optimal enforcement system through four propositions.
Following the proof of each proposition is a brief informal discussion of the result.10

9

Because my objective is to derive the socially optimal enforcement policy, I do not consider whether the
state’s policy is credible.
10

Although some of the proofs convey useful intuition, they may be skipped with little loss of continuity.

Propositions 1 and 2 describe the optimal fine for misrepresenting wealth, and its effect
on individuals’ decisions to engage in misrepresentation, when the audit probability is,
respectively, less than or equal to unity. Proposition 3 characterizes the optimal fine for the
offense. Proposition 4 establishes that the optimal audit probability is positive and may be less
than or equal to unity.
Proposition 1. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, q* < 1, then:
(a) the optimal fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level fM
* exceeds the optimal fine for
the offense; in particular, it equals the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability: fM
*=
f*O/q* > f*O;11
(b) individuals with wealth below the fine for misrepresentation fM
* misrepresent their
wealth levels, while individuals with wealth at and above fM
* pay the fine for the offense f*O; and
(c) there are some individuals who are capable of paying the fine for the offense f*O who
misrepresent their wealth levels (individuals with wealth between f*O and fM
* ).
Proof: (i) I first show that the optimal enforcement system is characterized by qfM $ fO.
Assume otherwise, that qfM < fO. If this condition were to hold, then individuals would
misrepresent their wealth regardless of their level of wealth (see (2)). Consequently, everyone
will be audited with probability q and their expected fine, conditional on having been detected
committing the offense, will be qw for w < fM and qfM for w $ fM. It is possible, however, to raise
social welfare by lowering fO to qfM. If fO = qfM, then fO < fM. If w # fO, (1) becomes qw < w,
which holds. If fO < w < fM, (1) becomes qw < fO, which holds because fO = qfM and w < fM. If w
$ fM, (1) becomes qfM < fO, which does not hold because fO = qfM. Thus, if fO is lowered to qfM,

11

As will be seen, fM
* is not unique. Any fM equal to or greater than f*/q*
is optimal. An analogous
O
observation applies to Proposition 2 below.

-8-

individuals for whom w < fM will continue to misrepresent their wealth levels, be audited with
probability q, and face an expected fine conditional on detection of qw. But individuals for
whom w $ fM will now choose to pay the fine for the offense fO and not misrepresent their wealth
levels. Since fO = qfM, they are deterred to the same extent as before. But since they pay the fine
fO, they are not audited. Thus, the behavior of individuals is not affected, but auditing costs are
reduced, thereby raising social welfare. In the optimal enforcement system, therefore, it must be
that qfM $ fO.
(ii) I next show that in the optimal enforcement system one can assume without loss of
generality that qfM = fO. Since step (i) rules out qfM < fO, suppose qfM > fO. Then, by (2),
individuals for whom w < fO/q would misrepresent their wealth levels and individuals for whom
w $ fO/q would not misrepresent their wealth. Consequently, an individual in the former group
will be audited with probability q and his expected fine, conditional on detection, will be qw (he
is unable to pay fM since w < fO/q < fM). Individuals in the latter group will pay the fine for the
offense fO (they are able to because w $ fO/q > fO) and not be audited. If fM is lowered until qfM =
fO, it is easy to see that individuals’ decisions about misrepresenting their wealth levels, and their
expected fines, are not affected. Hence, fM such that qfM = fO is optimal (as is any higher fM),
establishing part (a) of the proposition.
(iii) Given qfM = fO, (2) implies that w^ = fO/q = fM. In other words, individuals with
wealth below fM misrepresent their wealth levels, while individuals with wealth at or above fM do
not. Since fM = fO/q > fO, the latter individuals pay the fine fO. This establishes part (b).
(iv) Part (c) follows immediately from step (iii) since individuals with wealth between fO
and fM = fO/q > fO misrepresent their wealth levels.

Comment: It is easy to see why the optimal fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level fM
*
must be at least equal to the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability, f*O/q*. If this
were not the case, then the expected fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level, q*fM
* , would be
less than the fine for the offense, f*O, and no one would pay the fine for the offense. To induce
individuals to pay the fine for the offense, the fine for misrepresentation must be at least equal to
* = f*O/q*, not
f*O/q*. Any higher fine for misrepresentation has the same effect. Even if fM
everyone will pay the fine for the offense. In particular, individuals whose wealth is below fM
*
are unable to pay the full fine for misrepresentation, and thus cannot be induced to pay the fine
* > f*O, this includes some individuals who are capable of paying f*O. But
for the offense; since fM
everyone else can be threatened with a fine for misrepresentation of fM
* and therefore will pay the
fine for the offense.
Proposition 2. If the optimal audit probability equals unity, q* = 1, then:
(a) the optimal fine for misrepresenting one’s wealth level equals the optimal fine for the
offense: fM
* = f*O;
(b) individuals do not misrepresent their wealth levels; and
(c) everyone who is able to pay the fine for the offense f*O does so.
Proof: The proof of part (a) parallels steps (i) and (ii) in the proof of Proposition 1. Part
(b) follows from (1) given fM = fO. Part (c) follows immediately from part (b).
Comment: Clearly, if an audit is certain if one does not pay the fine for the offense, then a
fine for misrepresentation equal to the fine for the offense will induce those who are able to pay
the fine for the offense to do so. Individuals who are unable to pay the fine for the offense do not
have an incentive to misrepresent their wealth levels since they will have to pay their wealth
whether they are subject to the fine for the offense or the fine for misrepresentation.

Proposition 3. The optimal fine for the offense f*O
(a) is less than the harm divided by the probability of detection: f*O < h/p;
(b) results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing; and
(c) declines as the cost of auditing k increases.
Proof: (i) To show that f*O < h/p, first rewrite social welfare (4) using the result from part
(a) of Proposition 1 that qfM = fO. It follows from (2) that w^ = fO/q. For w # fO/q = fM, it follows
from (3) that b(w) = pmin{qw, min[w, fO]} = pqw. For w > fO/q = fM, b(w) = pmin{qfM, fO} =
pfO. Thus, social welfare can be rewritten as:
fO/q 4

I { I [b – h – pqk]r(b)db}g(w)dw
(5)

0 pqw
4 4

+ I { I [b – h]r(b)db}g(w)dw – e(p).
fO/q pfO

From (5), the first-order condition with respect to the fine for the offense fO is:
–pqk[1 – R(pfO)][dG(fO/q)/dfO] – [pfO – h][1 – G(fO/q)][dR(pfO)/dfO] = 0,

(6)

where G(.) is the cumulative distribution of wealth and R(.) is the cumulative distribution of
benefits. Since the first term in (6) is negative, the second term must be positive, which requires
pfO – h to be negative. In other words, it must be that fO < h/p, establishing part (a).
(ii) If auditing were costless, k = 0, (6) would require that pfO – h = 0, or pfO = h; since
the expected fine for the offense equals the harm, this would result in first-best deterrence (for
everyone who pays fO). But if auditing is costly, k > 0, step (i) showed that pfO < h, resulting in
underdeterrence. This establishes part (b).
(iii) By the implicit function theorem and the assumption that the second-order condition
for a maximum is satisfied with respect to the fine for the offense fO, the sign of dfO/dk is the

- 11 -

same as the sign of the derivative of the left-hand side of (6) with respect to k. The latter
derivative is –pq[1 – R(pfO)][dG(fO/q)/dfO] < 0. Thus, dfO/dk < 0, proving part (c).
Comment: To achieve first-best deterrence, the expected fine for the offense pfO would
have to equal the harm h or, equivalently, the fine for the offense fO would have to equal h/p.
The reason it is optimal to employ a lower fine, and tolerate some underdeterrence, is that doing
so reduces auditing costs. Specifically, if fO is lowered, more individuals will be willing to pay
fO rather than misrepresent their wealth levels (Proposition 1 established that individuals with
wealth levels above fM = fO/q will pay the fine for the offense). These individuals no longer will
be audited, thereby saving auditing costs. There is no first-order reduction in social welfare due
to the marginal individuals who now commit the offense as a result of the lower fine for the
offense, because they were individuals whose benefits just equaled the harm. Thus, it is optimal
to set the fine for the offense fO such that there is some underdeterrence, in order to reduce
auditing costs. Obviously, the higher the cost of an audit, the greater the motive to lower fO for
this reason.
Note that, although a fine usually is treated as a socially costless sanction because it is a
mere transfer of wealth, it is no longer socially costless if auditing is required to induce
individuals to pay the fine. In effect, there is a marginal social cost incurred from imposing a
higher fine due to the need for a higher audit rate to induce the payment of the fine. As a
consequence, the fine for the offense should not be as high as it would be in the absence of
auditing costs.12
12

The results in Polinsky and Shavell (1991), where it was assumed that offenders’ wealth levels could be
observed without cost, are a special case of the present analysis — when the cost of an audit, k, is zero. There it was
shown that the optimal fine for the offense is h/p, implying that individuals with wealth levels equal to or greater
than h/p are deterred to the first-best extent. Here, due to the cost of auditing, the optimal fine is less than h/p,
implying that all individuals are underdeterred.

- 12 -

Proposition 4. The optimal audit probability q*
(a) is positive: q* > 0;
(b) rises as the cost of auditing k declines; and
(c) equals unity for k sufficiently low.
Proof: (i) To demonstrate that the optimal audit probability q* is positive, suppose it
were zero. Then everyone would misrepresent their wealth levels. The critical value of benefit
b(w) would be zero for all wealth levels, regardless of the probability of detection p (see (3)).
But then it would be optimal for the state to spend nothing on enforcement, contradicting the
assumption that p* > 0. Thus, if the offense is worth deterring to any extent — that is, if p* >
0 — it must be that q* is positive, establishing part (a).13
(ii) To see that q* rises as k declines, consider the first-order condition with respect to q;
using (5), and after some manipulation, it can be written as:
4

fO/q

4

0

pqw

k –{Ipqr(b)db}[dG(fO/q)/dq] + I{[pq][dR(pqw)/dq] – Ipr(b)db}g(w)dw
pfO

(7)
fO/q

– I {[pqw – h][dR(pqw)/dq]}g(w)dw = 0.
0

By the implicit function theorem and the assumption that the second-order condition for a
maximum is satisfied with respect to q, the sign of dq/dk is the same as the sign of the derivative
of (7) with respect to k. The latter derivative is the expression in large brackets in (7). To see
that this expression must be negative, observe that pqw – h < 0 for w # fO/q because, by part (a)

13

This result does not require that the lowest level of wealth is zero, only that it is sufficiently low. Even if
the state could impose a fine for the offense equal to the lowest level of wealth without auditing individuals, if this
level is sufficiently low, the value of the resulting deterrence will be less than the cost of detection.

- 13 -

of Proposition 3, fO/q < h/pq. Thus, the last term in (7) is positive, which implies that the
expression in large brackets must be negative. This proves part (b).
(iii) To see that q* = 1 for k sufficiently low, I will first show that if k = 0, q* = 1. If k =
0, the derivative of social welfare with respect to q evaluated at q = 1 is the second term on the
left-hand side of (7) evaluated at q = 1, which is
fO

– I {[pw – h][dR(pw)/dq]}g(w)dw.

(8)

0

If k = 0, step (ii) of the proof of Proposition 3 showed that fO = h/p. Since pw – h < 0 for all w <
h/p, (8) is positive. This implies that q* = 1 if k = 0. Clearly, if k is sufficiently small, the
derivative of social welfare with respect to q evaluated at q = 1 will continue to be positive, in
which case q* will continue to equal unity. This establishes part (c).
Comment: If it is optimal to expend resources on trying to detect offenders, it must be
optimal to audit them with some probability if they are caught, since otherwise the expenditures
on detection would be wasted. (Of course, it might be optimal not to deter the harmful activity at
all if the cost of detection and/or the cost of auditing is sufficiently great.) For any given
probability of detection, a higher audit probability is beneficial because it induces more offenders
to pay the fine for the offense fO rather than misrepresent their wealth levels (see parts (a) and (b)
of Proposition 1), and thereby deters them to a better degree. Thus, if the cost of auditing were
to decline, the optimal audit probability would rise, and if the cost were low enough, the optimal
audit probability would be unity.

IV. Concluding Remarks
Although this article has considered monetary sanctions only, I want to observe in closing
that the appropriate use of an imprisonment sanction for misrepresenting one’s wealth could
increase social welfare. Specifically, suppose an imprisonment sentence, in addition to the fine
fM, is imposed on individuals who are found to have been capable of paying the fine for the
offense fO but who nonetheless misrepresented their wealth level. (Individuals who are not able
to pay the fine fO are sanctioned only with a fine equal to their wealth if they are found to have
misrepresented their wealth level, as above.) If the imprisonment sentence is high enough, such
individuals now can be induced to pay fO instead of misrepresenting their wealth level; and since
they pay fO, they will not be audited and will not bear the sentence. The behavior of all other
individuals is unaffected under this sentencing policy. Hence, social welfare rises because the
extent of underdeterrence, as well as the cost of auditing, declines for the affected individuals.
The preceding paragraph establishes that some use of the threat of imprisonment to deter
misrepresentation of wealth is socially desirable, but it does not derive the optimal use of
imprisonment sanctions for this purpose. It may be optimal also to impose imprisonment
sentences for misrepresentation on individuals who are not capable of paying the fine for the
offense fO. Although some of these individuals will be audited and bear the imprisonment
sentence, the additional deterrence due to use of an imprisonment sanction can allow the auditing
probability q or the probability of detection p to be lowered, thereby saving auditing or
enforcement costs. Thus, the optimal use of imprisonment to sanction misrepresentation of
wealth might involve sentences that depend on whether an individual is found to have been
capable of paying the fine for the offense fO.

- 15 -

Another possibility is to use imprisonment to sanction the offense. In a companion
paper — Polinsky (2004) — I consider the optimal use of fines and imprisonment when wealth is
assumed to be impossible to observe. I demonstrate in the model employed there that when
imprisonment sentences are used, the optimal choice of sanctions induces high-wealth offenders
to pay a fine that exceeds the wealth level of low-wealth offenders; by paying the fine, they
avoid a less desirable combination of sanctions they would bear if they paid only as much as
low-wealth offenders and faced a longer imprisonment sentence.14 Thus, an appropriately
designed sanctioning policy that includes imprisonment sentences for the offense can serve as an
alternative to auditing — both can reduce the incentive of offenders to misrepresent their wealth
levels.

14

This result is similar in spirit to a point developed by Levitt (1997), though he formally considers fines
and imprisonment sentences as alternatives, rather than the optimal combination of the sanctions.
