       Most of the theoretical literature on price-setting behavior deals with the special case in

which only a single price is changed. At the retail-store level, at least, where dozens of products

are sold by a single price-setter, price-setting policies are not formulated for individual products.

This feature of economic behavior raises a host of questions whose answers carry interesting

implications. Are price setters staggered in the timing of price changes? Are price changes of

different products synchronized within the store? If so, is this a result of aggregate shocks or

of the presence of a store-specific component in the cost of adjusting prices? Can observed small

changes in prices be rationalized by a menu cost model? We exploit the multiproduct dimension

of the dataset on prices used in Lach and Tsiddon (1992a) to explore several of these and other

issues. To the best of our knowledge this is the first empirical work on this subject.

1. Introduction

          One of   the most important lessons learned from the Fischer-Taylor analysis of staggered contracts

is that the mechanism responsible for the long lag In the response of the aggregate price level to shocks

in the money supply relies crucially on the assumption of staggered contracts. If agents ftilly synchronize

their actions, the maximum lag of the aggregate response to shocks in the money supply is the length of

the contract.

          The logic of this argument applies in the price-setting context as well. Under flail information,

a necessary condition for changes in the aggregate price level to lag behind shocks in the money supply

is that the response of price-setters to the monetary shock is staggered over time. Since not all price-

setters change their prices simultaneously, each price-setter takes into account that some of his

competitors have not yet changed their prices which prevents him from changing his own product? prices

to fully accommodate the change in the money supply. Hence changes in the aggregate price level lag

behind changes in the money supply.

          As shown by Caplin and Spulber (1987), staggering may not be sufficient to generate lags in the

response of the aggregate price level, even when price-setters change prices discontinuously. It is,

however, always a necessary condition to generate such lag.'

          In Lath and Tsiddon (1992; hereafter L&T). we analyzed store-level, monthly price data of 26

food products sold in Israel during high inflation periods. Figure 1, reproduced from lAST, shows that

price changes do indeed seem to be staggered: in any single month the proportion of price changes is

never close either to zero or to one, and it is fairly constant over the 18 months analyzed; it hovers

around 30 percent, which is consistent with an average duration of a nominal price quotation of 2.5-3

months.

          Note that the staggering referred to above, and in the macroeconomic literature in general, is


     See also Ball and Ceccbetti (1988), Caballero and Engel (1991. 1993) and Taiddon (1993).
                                                                                                               2
 across    decision-makers (price-setters), not across products. Most of the theoretical and empirical
 literature on price-setting behavior focuses on the single-product case, thus avoiding the conceptual

 ambiguity in the concept of staggering. Nevertheless, the presence of multiproduct firms raises the

 possibility that the staggering of price changes occurs across products and not across price-setters.2 For

 example, suppose that price-setters sell the same 9 products and change the prices of the first three

 products in month I, of the second three products in month 2 and of the last three in monthS. In month

 4 they start the cycle again. We will then observe that a third of all
                                                                        prices are changed in each month.
 The reason is staggering across (groups of) products and perfect synchronization of all price-setters. Of

 course, the same observed number of changes is obtained when a third of the stores change all 9 prices

 in month I, another third does so in month 2, and the remaining third of all
                                                                              stores changes prices in
month 3, The reason here, however,         is staggering of price-setters in the   timing of their price changes
accompanied with perfect synchronization of price changes within each store.

          This extreme example shows that the same observed data can result from
                                                                                 diametrically opposed
causes. The problem with Figure I is that it does not distinguish between
                                                                          changes in products' prices
within a store or across stores. This paper will tackle this issue and shed some
                                                                                 light on the forces
responsible for staggered price changes. Distinguishing between prices-setters and
                                                                                   products' staggering
is important for macroeconomic analysis.

          Our analysis leads us to conclude that Figure I is the result of staggering across price-setters,

while price changes of different products are synchronized, although not
                                                                             hilly, within the store. That is,
the data exhibit across-stores   stunting and within-store synchronization in the timing of price changes.
This finding validates the assumption of staggered decisions across price-setters made in most of the

'sticky prices' literature.
          We also think that the existence of within-store synchronization fits better the implications of


   'Tommasi (1993a) seems to be the first to address this issue.
                                                                                                               3


models   of price-setting behavior based on the presence of convex costs of adjusting prices (menu cost

models), than those of models based on imperfect information, or those of models based on search

equilibrium with no convexities. The following example explains why.

         Suppose an aggregate shock arrives at the store — how will it react? According to signal

extraction models, a store will change the prices of all its products in a manner directly related to the size

of the shock. According to menu costs models, if the store faces costs of adjusting the price of each

product, and if these costs have a store-specific component, then not all stores will necessarily change

their prices. Because of this fixed cost component, stores that do change prices will tend to so for most

of their products. Furthermore, there is     no   clear-cut relationship between the size of the price change

and the size of the shock. The implications of the last approach are less obvious since, to the best of our

knowledge, there exists no model of a multiproduct search equilibrium. It seems likely, however, that

a firm in such an equilibrium will respond to an aggregate shock by changing only some of its, prices

upon impact, postponing other products' price changes for a while. Changing all prices together may

generate too strong   a   signal which is liable to drive consumers away.

         This line of reasoning indicates that within-store synchronization in the timing of price changes

tends to accord more with menu cost models, where some of these costs are specific to the store (and not

to the products), than with the other two explanations.'

         The observation of small price changes in the data is often brought up as evidence against the

relevance of menu costs models. In this paper we claim that such small changes can be expected when

a multiproduct firm is subject to costs of adjusting prices that have a firm-specific component. In this
                                                                                               be
case, the optimal change in the price of a single product may indeed be small. What should not

observed if store-specific costs exist is fl simultaneous price changes in the store being small. Indeed,



        Obviously, the three explanations do not contradict one another. In some cases it is useM to consider some
or all ol these explanations together (e.g., Benabou, 1988).

  the data show that the average change within a store is large.

          The paper is organized as follows: next section briefly describes the price data. In Section 3,

  across-stores   staggering in the timing of price changes is analyzed. The evidence on within-store

 synchronization is presented in Section 4. Section S investigates the timing of negative price changes.

 Section 6 interprets the accumulated evidence, and Section 7 deals with the importance of store-specific

 menu costs from various perspectives. Conclusions close the

 2. Descriotign of the data

          The data   used   in this work is a subsample of the data used in [AcT, where it is described in

 detail. The original data set consists of nominal price quotations for 26 food
                                                                                products collected monthly
 from a sample of stores by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) for the purpose of computing the

 consumer price index (CPl).' That is, for each product we have a panel of
                                                                                   prices extending across stores
 and over time. Alternatively, for each store we have a panel of prices extending over products and over

 time.

         The products in the sample are all homogeneous, did not change substantially either in quality

or in market structure, and their prices were not controlled by the government during the period of

investigation.

         Since part of the focus of the current study is on issues related to the co-movement of prices

within stores, we selected 21 products that could be grouped into two broad classes: wines and meat

products.' Note that each store in our data sells either wine or meat products. None of the stores in our




     These are grocery or liquor stores; supermarkets and chain stores are not included in the sample.

      Wine products consist of 9 wInes and liquors; agrack (anise), whiis vermouth,
                                                                                    liquor, champagne, vodka, red
wine, rosd wine, hock wine and sweet red wino. The 12 meat products, including three types of fish, are: fresh
beef, frozen goulash, frozen beef liver, fresh beef liver, chicken
                                                                   breast, chicken liver, turkey breast, beefsteak,
dnzmsucks, fish fillet, bun fish and codfish.
                                                                                                              S

sample sell both wines and meat.

          The periods for which most of the data are available are 1978-1979, 1981-1982, and the first nine

months of 1984, before across-the-board price controls were put first into effect. The data for 1980 and

1983 have disappeared from the CBS archives. The analysis in this paper Is restricted to the 1978-1979:6

subperiod, corresponding to a single inflationary step as defined by Liviatan and Piternian (1986). because

the price-duration data are less affected by the 1 month truncation introduced by the sampling interval.'

          The object of study is the occurrence of a price change. In order to take accountof round-off

errors this event is defined to occur whenever a observed price change exceeds half a percent.

          In the latter part of this paper we analyze the within-store dimension of the data. For this to be

meaningM we focus on stores selling three or more products. The upper graph in Figure 2 plots the

number of stores meeting this requirement by product class. Twice as many stores sell meat than wines,

and the number of stores is stable over time.7 The number of products, averaged over stores, is given

in the lower graph: it fluctuates between 5.5    and   6 products with a standard deviation of 2-2.5 products.

There is not much variation over time in these averages. There is variation, however, in the number of

products actually sampled across stores — there are relatively more meat stores selling fewer products

than liquor stores, and only a few meat stores sell over 9 products.



3. Across-stores stanerin2
           As mentioned in the Introduction, a necessary condition fir an effective monetary policy is that

not all price-setters should change their prices simultaneously in response to a monetary shock. If this

is so, each price-setter takes into account that some of his competitors have not yet changed their prices


   'During this period the mean inflation rate was 3.9 paves! per month, with snind deviation of 1.9 percent.
The median rate was 3.5 percent per month.

      7In L&T we showed that overt though there were sent cbaages over time in the identity of the stores, there
is   a sizable
            core of stores that remained in the sample for long periods of time.
                                                                                                               6
 which, in turn, prevents him from changing those of his own products to fully accommodate the monetary

 shock. Hence, the aggregate price level may not respond completely and immediately to unexpected

 changes in monetary policy.

         This lack of simultaneity is termed 'across-stores staggering". The term refers to staggering in

 the timing of price changes across different stores for a gjy product. In most macroeconomic models

 (e.g.. Fischer, 1977), across-stores staggering implies more than mere lack of simultaneity; It also
 embodies the notion of 'regular cyclicity" in the response of price-setters to a shock. One group of price-

 setters is first to change prices, thllowed by another group of different price-setters; at some point in

 time, however, before the second group acts again, the first group of price-setters changes its prices a

 second time.' Our data are uniquely suited to check the extent to which these phenomena prevail. This

 is the purpose of this section.

         At this stage let us clarify the relationship between statisticai independence across stores and

 staggering. Let X =     1   indicate that store i changed the price ofproductj in month t. Otherwise, X
 = 0. Obviously, the timing of price changes is correlated
                                                      across stores, implying that the {} process

exhibits some form of cross-sectional dependency (across stores i). The critical point is that this

correlation may result because of the stores' response to factors common to all stores (e.g., to an increase

in the aggregate rate of inflation), and not because of strategic behavior. In fact, given thatour data are

composed of small grocery stores located all over the country (we do not sample supermarkets), this is

not a bad assumption. Hence the assertion that some stores act on the premise that some of their
competitors have not yet changed their prices Is not interpreted literally as "neck-to neck" competition.

Letting Z, denote all the common factors alluded to above we assume that conditional on 4                the

probability of store i changing the price of some product is not affected by what store k does or did.



    'A unique exception in this context is Calvo (1983). While Cilvo's model is nay useful for understanding
the dynamics of inflation, its empüical inadequacy at the micro level has been pointed out by Taylor (1983).
                                                                                                        7

That is, conditional on (7.), the process (XJ is independent across i. Hereafter, independence across

stores refers to conditional independence.

        This section is divided into three pans, each presenting empirical evidence on differentfeatures

of across-stores staggering in the timing of price changes.



A. Pronortion of yrice cbanes

        The first step is to examine, for each product, the time series of the proportion of stores that

changed prices. Simultaneity or lack of staggering implies that stores either change their prices together

or do not, i.e., that the observed proportions are close to one or to zero.

        Figure 3 presents such a time series for the 17 months between February 1978 and June 1979,

for each product. At first glance, the proportion of stores changing prices is well below 1 in all months,

with the exception of November 1978. The requirement that these proportions be above zero is also

satisfied though to a lesser extent. Omitting the November 1978 observation, meat products do not

exhibit much variability over time compared to wines. Wines, on the other hand, display a quite regular

seasonal pattern with a much lower proportion of stores changing prices during the first half of the year.

        In a stationaxy inflation environment a store following an (S-s) pricing policy is expected to

change its prices by the same amount every 6 months (6 being determined by the parameters of the

inflation process and profit function (Sheshiuski-Weiss; see 1992). What does this imply for the

observed proportions of stores changing prices? If stores are expected to change prices every 6 months,

and there is sufficient heterogeneity in the initial conditions, then after a long enough number of months,

the proportion of stores changing prices every month should stabilize around 1/6. The horizontal dotted

line in each panel of Figures 4 and 5 is 1/6, where 6 is the average duration of a price quotation taken




    'In expectations, the store's policy is obseivalionally equivilait to itisne-dependealt policy.
                                                                                                                 8

 from Table 4 in L&T.'° The 'fit' seems to be much better for meat products than for wines.



 B. Simultaneous nrice chanees

          The issue of staggering can be tackled from another angle by asking: how many stores change

 prices simultaneously? When store i changes the price of productj during month t, Ma other stores are

 doing the same. Tables Al and A2 in the Appendix show the grand mean ML., Ma averaged over months

 and products sold by score i, for each store i (column 1). Column 2 shows Ma divided by the number

 of competitors, the number of stores selling product j as t minus I, aiso averaged over months and

 products. For example, store 1 in Table Al changes the price of a typical wine product simultaneously

 with 7.3 other stores on average. (45 percent of its competitors). Summary statistics of these tables are

 presented in Table 1.

(42 percent of its competitors) on average. These figures are quite representative: 62.5 percent of the

stores change price simultaneously with 5-9 other stores; 50 percent of the stores change prices at the

same time that 32-52 percent of their competitors do so. Most stores selling meat products usually

change prices simultaneously with 56 percent of their competitors; the interquartile range is only 6

percent."
        The preceding analysis indicates that the proportion of stores is away from the zero-one

boundaries in general; furthermore, from the point of view of the individual store, a change in prices does

not indicate that all of its competitors follow suit, even though a sizable share of them do.



C. Re2ular cvclicitv

        Another characteristic of across-stores staggering is not captured either by the observed

proportions of price changes or by the number of simultaneous moves. As the opening paragraph of this

section suggested, having the aani group of firms change prices every month during the first, say, six

months, while another group does so during the second part of the year, is ng the kind of staggering

economists have in mind when analyzing price dynamics; it does             conform with the notion of regular

cyclicity. This is also not the behavior implied by the (S-s) model of price changes. Staggering embodies

a notion of regular cyclicity.

        The 'perfecC across-stores staggering is one In which, in response to a monetary shock, a

different t/ô of all stores changes prices every month. After S months all stores have responded to the

shock and the cycle can start again. Hence, the perfect time series of X is composed of ones every 6

months and zeros everywhere else.




    11es   figures are averages sad should be treated with caution. For each stoic there is variation both in the
number of months sampled within each product and in the number of pioducla sold.
                                                                                                                   10

          We examine the X time series for each store I and productJ. There are potentially 360 and

 1,080 such series for wines and meat products respectively.' We focus on the occurrence of
 consecutive price changes; a pattern not consistent with across-store staggering in the timing of price

 changes. For our purposes, this is more informative than descriptive statistics on the duration of price

 quotations for each store. We count the number of times prices were observed to change consecutively

 at least twice, at least three times, and so on. The counting is done for each store separately over all the

 products sold by the store and over the months for which data form it are available (the maximum being

 17 months per product). Since the number of products sold and the number of months for which there

 are data vary over stores, we divide the observed number of K consecutive price changes by the notential

number of K consecutive price changes, for 2 K s 17. The entries in Tables A3 and A4 can thus

be interpreted as unconditional probabilities of observing K consecutive price changesY Table 2

presents summary statistics.




      For example, there are 40 distinct stores selling some oldie 9 wine products. Potentially there are 360 series,
but a non-negligible number of them axe missing since exist stores do not sell ail9products.

    "We count non-overlapping spells of      secutive price changes. For example, & spell of 4 consecutive changes
is counted only once as a spell of 4 and not as 3 spells of 2 or 2 spells of 3. The qualifier at least' is important.
Since our data are censored from both sight and left, there are many instances in which a spell of two consecutive
price changes is preceded or followed by a missing value. The censoring results either from a store not being
included in the sample in • pazticuJar month or from the store having run out of the product at the time of nmpling.
         The potential number of K consecutive price changes is derived as followE first, we i4aiti, the spells of
L consecutsve observations onX,, 2 1. 17. The reason for having spells of varying size is the presence of
lots of missing values in the X's. Neat, for each spell of length L we count the number of possible ways K non-
overlapping consecutive price changes, X, — 1, can ar. We then aim over all observed spells.                F0
example, store 1 sells 7 wine products. The number of times two consecutive price changes occurs is 2, 0, 0, 1,
0, 0 and 1 respectively. The observed number of two consecutive price changes ii, therefore, 4. We identified
2 spells or? consecutive non-missirgX' s (in products 1 and 9), 3 spells of 6 (in products 2, 6 and 7), 1 spell of
5 (in product 8), one spell of 3 (in product 3) and one spell of 2 (in product 3). The potential number of two
consecutive price changes is, therefore, 14. The Cl entry for store lii 4114 a 0.286.

        From Table A3 we see that close to 40 percent of the liquor itores never spread out a change in

the price of any of its products over two or more months (C2-C17 have zero entries in 15 stores). The

estimated probability of spreading out a price change over two or three consecutive months is quite low

(except for stores 1, 2 and 9). The mean probability, averaged over stores, is 8.3 percent, while the

median probability is only 5 percent, reflecting the large number of zero values. Even without their

standard errors, these estimates suggest that consecutive price changes are not a prevalent phenomenon

in liquor stores.

        Table A4 indicates that most stores selling meat products experienced two, three and even four

consecutive price changes at least once. Although infrequent - the mean probability Is never above 19

percent - these events do occur often enough to warrant a different characterization than liquor stores.

Note that a non-negligible number of stores do have 5 or more consecutive price changes. Unlike liquor

stores, the notion of across-stores staggering in the timing of price changes finds less support in the meat-

products market. We return to this point at the end of the section.
                                                                                                                     12
           A different perspective on the issue of regular cyclicity is also instructive. A modest requirement

 for staggering to occur is that stores alternate their decisions to change prices, I.e., that stores that change

 prices in the current month did not do so the month before and, conversely, stores that changed prices

 last month do not do so this month." Note that this behavior Is not sufficient to generate staggering.

 If stores do behave this way, ng if there is sufficient heterogeneity in the stores' initial conditions,

 across-stores staggering will be occur. Otherwise, the result may be a situation where all stores do indeed

 alternate their price changes but do so in a synchronized thshlon. Note, however, that the latter

 theoreticai possibility is not supported by our findings in the previous subsectionQ'

           A simple 2*2 contingency table with two rows for the values of Xi,., and two columns for the

values of X, summarizes this information for each store-product-month observation. Assuming thatX

is (conditionally) independent and identically distributed across stores allows us to aggregate the tables
over stores) This still leaves us with 17*21 tables for each product-month combination. Assuming

that the distribution of X, is time-invariant during the 17 months reduces the information to 21 2*2 tables

(9 wines and 12 meat products). Table 3 presents these contingency tables.




    ' An  empirical check of this assertion is meaningflil only if stores are sampled more often than the frequency
of price changes which is the case in the 1978-1976:6 period.

behavior is not mificient to generate aaose-one staggering in. the timing ofprice changes. In this context,

conditional probability or changing the price is the nine sane. stores and is time-invariant, and if the stores behave
tndependantly of each other, in the limit, the proportion of stores changing pSe is constant over time.

    "Note that this assumption allows for heterogeneity in the size of the price change.

        The frequency counts over stores and months of the event represented by each cell are used to

compute probabilities. The top entry in each cell is the row percentage which is the maximum likelihood

estimator of the probability of;   given X. The bottom entry is the column percentage which is the
maximum likelihood estimator of the probability of X, given X. Letting the first coordinate be the

value of X at t-1 and the second its value at t then 0.26 in the (0,1) cell of the first contingency table is

the probability of a liquor store changing the price of product 1 at t given that he did not change that

price in the previous month, while 0.72 is the probability that in the last period a store did not change

the price given that the price is changed at t.

        The only implications of across-stores staggering are that the (0,1) and (1,0) entries are large

relative to the (1,1) entry. In probability terms, the probability of J1Q price change at t-1 conditional on

a change at t is larger than the probability of a price change at t-1 conditional on a change at t (column

percent); and, the probability of     price change at t conditional on a change at t-l is larger than the

probability of a price change at t conditional on a change at t-1 (row percent).

        Liquor stores easily satisfy these implications, a finding consistent with the relativly small number

of price changes in consecutive months. Meat stores do not.

        We can summarize this information by averaging over products. Aggregating over products

instead of over months yields 17 contingency tables. This averaging is appropriate to the extent that there

are no systematic differences in the probability of a price change across products which may be the case

in our data (see Section 4.A). Since there is a natural ordering to them we graph their entries against

the time axis. The top panels in Figure 4 show the proportion of stores that changed prices at t but not

at t-l, out of all stores that changed price at t. Let this proportion be denoted by Qrn.              is the

conditional probability of   X.1 =    0   given X = I, which can        be computed from each month's

 contingency table by averaging the column percentage of the (0,1) cell over J products.t' This

 probability is to be compared to the average column percentage of the (1,1) cell,         Q11.

          The other entry of interest in these tables is the (1,0) cell: the number of stores changing price

 at V.! but not at I. The average row percentage in this case is denoted by P10 it estimates the conditional

 probability of X = 0 given X, =           1,   and is to be compared with the average row percentage of the

 (1,1) cell, P11. The bottom panels in Figure 4 plot these probabilities against time.

         These plots confirm our previous finding that liquor stores are characterized by what we term

  regular cyclicity in the timing of price changes: P is below P,1 only in November 1978 and June

 1979, while Q0, is never below Q11. This pattern of price changes is not that characteristic of the meat-

products market. This conclusion is also supported by Tables A5 and A6 in the appendix, which present

the ratios ,a1,     and   Q01/Q,, over time for each product separately.

         In this section we analyze three features of the data: the proportion of price changes, the number

of simultaneous moves and the phenomenon of regu$ar cyclicity. The behavior of liquor stores matches

the predictions of a model in which stores are staggered in the timing of each product's price changes.

These new findings reinforce the conclusion reached in TAT that prices of wine products are slow to

adjust, with the proviso that the timing of the price changes is staggered across liquor stores.

         The results for stores selling meat products are mixed. The proportion of price changes are

bounded away from zero and one and, on average, stores change prices at the same time as 56percent

of their competitors. Therefore, these stores' behavior exhibits characteristics of across-stores staggering.

In many cases, however, the behavior of these stores is not in accordance with the concept of regular

cyclicity — in some instances blatantly so.

        The difference in behavior between the two markets, meat products and wines, is certainly

interesting, but before we speculate on the reasons for this difference, we should consider the possibility

that it is an artifact of the data. For across-stores staggering to be observed we require, in addition to

staggering in the tinting of price changes across stores, that the duration of a price quotation be greater

than one month (the sampling interval). Otherwise, if all prices change within a month, we will not

detect across-stores staggering by our definition even though the timing of the price changes may indeed

be staggered within the month. Put differently, those stores not exhibiting regular cyclicity defined on

a monthly basis may be satis'ing a higher frequency regular cyclicity which cannot be observed given

the one month length of the sampling interval. Since the average duration of a price within this group

of stores is less than two months — the unweighted mean is 132 with a standard deviation of 0.22 (Fable

4 in L&T) - stores selling meat products may fail to show staggering simply because we cannot detect

this behavior given our sampling frequency, not because the timing of prices changes are not staggered.

        The quantitative implications of this argument can be gauged by analyzing the following
benchmark case. Consider a one-product environment with a constant and deterministic rate of inflation

and perfect staggering where prices changes once every 45 days and the sampling frequency is 30

days." in this scenario, half the stores will exhibit 2 consecutive price changes. No store will have
any consecutive price changes when the duration of a price quotation is 2 months or more. When the

average duration is 1.12 we are bound to expect some stores to fail the regular cyclicity test. Given the

heterogeneity across products, stores and time present in our data it is, however, a formidable task to



    "In this example, perfect staggering occum &then each firm change. its price exactly every 45   days and &

  derive the exact benchmark number to which our results ought to be compared with. The upshot of this

  disclaimer is that the observation of stores failing to exhibit regular cyclicity defined on a monthly basis

  is not necessarily evidence against the hypothesis of across-stores staggering.

          What are the implications of our finding that stores stagger their price changes in a cyclical

 pattern within each product market? First, this feature clearly undermines the view that sector (product)

 speciric shocks guide the inflationary process (Bruno and Sachs, 1985). Infact, the staggering of price
 changes over time smooths down sectoral shocks and therefore mitigates, or at least spreads out, their

 impact n aggregate variables.

          Second, the small number of consecutive price changes goes against the notion that price rigidity

 emerges from a gradual "search and adjust" process, as suggested by some search models ('Zeira, 1987;

 Rob, 1991). This implication, however, is not a surprising one since, in these type of search models,

 gradual adjustment emerges from jçgj pre-commitment (adjustment costs, irreversibility). Since prices

 are always set in nominal terms, a high rate of inflation makes the commitment to a real price a reversible

decision. When the rate of inflation is 4 percent per month, itseenis that the effect ofirreversibility on
decision making is not that strong.19

         Across-stores staggering raises questions on the empirical Implications of signal extraction models

of price-setting behavior. The structure of the shocks that can generate the observed sorting over time

of stores should not only discriminate across stores but do so cyclically. This is very unlikely to occur.

Nonetheless, one may think of the pattern of regular cyclicity and staggering as emerging from the

geographic heterogeneity of monetary shocks. We rebut this view in Section 6.

        Across-stores staggering occurs in the market for each individual product, Le., in the across-


       If our conjecture that inflation erodes commitment is true, our findings are appropriate for high inflation
levels only. If the reasons for price rigidity may differ between low and high rates of inflation, inflationary
dynamics would differ accordingly. Tommasi (1993b) builds a search model where inflation erodes the
informational content of prices. He shows that at some — this effect dominates so that search loses its i,otential
and declines in equilibrium.

stores dimension. In foodstuffs, as in most products, stores (price-setters) aeJl many different products.

The natural question to ask is whether stores, as multiproduct firms, make use of this fact to learn about

the inflationary process, or are adjustment costs lumpy enough to prevent such search activity?

        This issue is crucial when trying to discriminate among the different models of price-setting

behavior. If stores do change different products' prices on different dates one could interpret regular

cyclicity as a costly search process where each change in a specific price is an investment in discovering

the aggregate shock.   If so, signal extraction can still be a dominant factor at the level of the price-setter
even though each specific product market exhibits both staggering and regular cyclicity. In addition,

when trade is sequential (Lucas and Woodford, 1993; Eden, 1994), store-level price dynamics may

closely resemble the dynamics of rigid prices but its implications for the aggregate level are very

different. This similarity at the store level, however, breaks down when the store is a multiproduct firm.

Extensions of the signal extractions and sequential trading models would suggest the presence of within-

store sta2gerinE in addition to the observed across-store staggering. By this we mean that when a firm

sells many products it should tend to change the prices of some products each date rather than lumping

all price changes together.

        In order to address this isomorphism between the store-level implications of different models of

price-setting behavior, and also because it is interesting in its own right, we analyze the within-store

dimension of the data.



4. Within-store synchronization

        The issue is whether stores tend to change the prices of different products simultaneously. That

is, we ask whether or not the change in the price of a particular product in a particular store is usually

accompanied by changes in other products' prices in the same store. If suck simultaneity exists we call

it within-store synchronization.
                                                                                                                   20

         Note that we investigate synchronization in the timing of changes in the prices of different

products sold in a single store. Other related issues, such as the cross-correlation in the size of the price

changes, are not explored. Synchronization in the timing of price changes may have very different
implications from those of correlation in the size of change. We comment briefly on this issue in Section

6.



A. Pronortion of Price Changes

         A natural measure of the degree of within-store synchronization is the proportion of products

whose prices changed during a month. In our notation, this proportion is


                                                                                                                 (2)
                                                        IGSIJ€*7,




where G• is the set of products whose prices were recorded in store i during months t-1 and t (i.e., the

number of products sold at t-l and t, or the number of non-missing values of X) and IGU is the
cardinality of the set. We actually define         for the subsample of stores that sell at least three products

in each class, I GJ 3. Recall that the stores in our sample sell either meat products or wines, but not

both. Hence, synchronization between classes of products cannot be addressed with these data.

         We start by asking what values of p should be expected when there is within-store
synchronization. Clearly, we cannot provide a definite answer to this question without a structural model,




       A problem with 915 that we do not know whether morn than one change in price occurred within the month1
so that an observed of 1 can be the resujt of different values for 'i defined on, say, a weekly basis. Our
definition of synchronization allows (or this possibility so that two products are said to be synchronized if one
changes its price the first day of the month and the other does so the last day of the mat month. Another issue
is that we sample a small fraction of the products sold by the store so that the true ç may be very different from
the observed . Our results an, of course, conditional on the sample. To the extent that the sample of products
within each class is rindom we could carry over the conclusions of the analysis to the entire population in each class
of products.
                                                                                                                   21

but we can be fairly confident that when inflation is as high as it was during the period - 3.9 percent per

month — the probability of a store not changing zi of its products' prices during a month is very low

when the decision to change price is independent across products. Hence, observing many 's equal to

zero should be indicative of within-store-synchronization.2 Table 4 presents the frequency

distribution of 'p, for wines and meat products.

         The difference between wine and meat products is quite striking. While most of the

observations in wines correspond to = 0, the distribution of for meat products is much more

balanced. If E = 0 is the only positive evidence for synchronization in the tinting of price changes



    flj is important to recall that there was no slowdown in the rate of inflation during this period.
       The mme conclusion could be reached if all prices wen changed during the month,                1. A problem with
this conclusion is that, given a positive rate of inflation, and with a long enough interval of time between samplings,
a store will eventually change all its prices and we will observe         — 1. To deduce that there is synchronizstjon
acrose products is, of count, misleading. In this case, ç 1 is evidence of nothing but the fact that the frequency
of sampling is too low relative to the rate of inflation. Hence we should be cautious in the interpretation of c's
equal to one. We do not, however, believe this is an issue in our data. Recall that in this period, when the average
monthly rate of inflation was 3.9 percent, the avenge duration of a price quotation was 2.2 months. Had we used
quarterly data, ow de6nition of synchronization would guarantee that we find perfect within-store synchronization
in the data. But since we use monthly data, the severeness of this problem is reduced. In particular, note that for
wine products the avenge duration of a price quotation is 4 months.
                                                                                                               22
across products we must conclude that most wine stores synchronize the timing of the price changes

of their products, while stores selling meat products do so to a lesser extent?

         In the remainder of this section we present additional evidence favoring the within-store

synchronization hypothesis. We provide formal tests of the hypothesis, but doing so requires a series

of compromising assumptions. It is therefore comforting to note that the direct evidence and

conclusions from Table 4 bold up to more formal analysis.

         The expected value of       is


                                                                                                             (3)

where P    Prob{X, = l} is the unconditional probability of observing a price change in productj
at store i during month t.

         The null hypothesis to be tested is the case of no within-store synchronization. This is

interpreted as stating that the sequence (XVI) is pairwise independent over products j. Under this

hypothesis, the variance of ' is


                                                                                                             (4)

                                                       -




      In an attempt to see whether the heterogeneity in the number of products sold by the store,  , has an effect
on the conclusions because ofl possible effect of I G onp, we divided the observations into those corresponding
to stores having 3 I Gj 5 and those with G 6. The conclusions were similar to those of Table 4.
                                                                                                        23

is approximately distributed as a standard normal variable. If {Xa} Is a sequence of independent

random variables over stores i, then

                                                    -           a
                                        TI.                                                          (5)




where N, is the set of stores with non-missingç at time t.

        We focus on T since IGI is relatively smaller than N in our data. 'T is not a statistic since it

depends on unknown parameters. Note that neither E() nor V(ç) are observed nor does the null

hypothesis speci' their value. E() and V() have to be estimated and for this we need estimators of

the probabilities of a price change in all the products.        Under the null hypothesis we do not

need to estimate the joint probability of X,...,Xa and then integrate out the marginal probabilities.

Thus, under the null hypothesis, estimation of P is greatly simplified since It allows us to ignore the

information embodied in the behavior of the other products. Since P cannot be estimated for every

store-product-month observation we have to make some assumptions. The first one is



                  {X0j is lid over i.                                                               (Al)



        This assumption restricts the probability of a price change to be the same across stores, but

allows for heterogeneity in the size of the price change. For all stores i, P, = P. Note that E(co)

and V(,j may vary across stores because of differences in the number and composition of products

sold at time t.

        We now consider two distinct scenarios for es atingP. The first scenario assumes



        {X4j is independent, not identically distributed, over t.                                    (A2)
                                                                                                            24

        Assuming    Al and A2, a consistent estimator of P under the null hypothesis Is the sample
mean of X over stores i


                                                                                                           (6)




where N, is the set of stores selling productj in months t and t-l.

        This estimator of the unconditional probability of a price change was analyzed in Section 3.A

and plotted in Figure 3 fbi every product. X is the proportion of stores changing product js price at

t. When substituting the P's by the sample means of the ;'s the test has the nice feature that it

compares a measure in    the within-store dimension with a measure in the across-store dimension. We

will return to this interpretation after presenting the results of the test.

        The second scenario for estimating l' takes explicit account of the dynamics      in the;
process. Assume




        P(X / 13 = PtX /       X.j.                                                                       (AT)


        This assumption states that the probability of observing X conditional      on all the relevant

information available to store i at time 1, jk, is the same as that probability conditional only on

information on what happened to product j during the previous period. This assumption embeds the

restriction imposed by the null hypothesis jointly with a Markovian assumption. Note, too, that the

conditional probability is time invariant, which may be a strong restriction even though the

macroeconomic environment — the inflation rate — was quite stable        during the period- In a sense

(A2') is the complement of (A2). It assumes a particular type of time dependence for the {Xj

process, but restricts it to be stationary over time, whereas (A2) allows for non-stationarity but
                                                                                                        25
assumes independence over time.

        Under assumptions Al and AT we can dispense with the store and time subscripts and denote

the probability of a price change in productj conditional on          as P/O) and P(l), according to

whether X isO or 1. The stochastic process {X} is a time-invariant Markov chain overt. There

are different chains for different products, but all stores follow identical processes. The one-step

transition probabilities matrix is

        Under assumptions Al and AT the maximum likelihood estimators of the one-step transition

probabilities are the row percentages in Table 3. In order to get the unconditional probabilities

appearing in (3) we need to know the probability distribution of the initial state Xe,. Given the initial

distribution we can obtain the unconditional probability of a price change at any time tin product


                                            (1 P7)P/OY0 4 P7Ppt'                                       (8)




where, say, p is the probability of a price change at t0 and P(O)° is the probability of a price

change at time t conditional on no price change at t = 0. More precisely I1(O)m is the (0,1) element

in the t-step transition probabilities matrix 6'j° (6' multiplied by itself t times).

        It turns out that the limiting probabilities r and I-I) of the Markov chains given by the

matrices in Table 3 are arrived at very rapidly. Irrespective of the values of the initial probabilities,

it takes at most 2 or 3 periods to get within three decimal places of the limiting probabilities. That is,

        There does   not seem to be much difference between the two ways of estimating P. In

addition, the small stancJarcj deviations of the estimates indicate that there is not much variation in

across products. This feature is important since it implies that w1 Is close to a binomial random

variable under the null hypothesis.

        It should be noted that the absence of within-store synchronization does not rule out the

possibility that a large proportion of products behave in the same way. This is, in fact, expected due
                                                                                                         27

to the high level of inflation during the period. Lack of synchronization merely says that the joint

probability of              is the product of the marginal probabilities ftr each product: it can be

anything between 0 and 1.

          As mentioned above, the version of the test usingX as the estimator of? has a simple

interpretation: it compares a measure of within-store synchronization ('pj) with an average measure of

across-stores synchronization. The latter is based on 4 the proportion of stores changing the price

of product j during a month, which was, in fact, used to characterS across-stores staggering in

Section   IA.
          If within-store synchronization is the result of a matching between the products sold by the

store and an inflationary shock then both      and   X should follow similar patterns. In addition,

heterogeneity in the inflation process, across products or over time, should not cause much of a
                                                                                                             28

difference between 'p and4 Put differently, the results of the test mean that the observed within-

store synchronization is unrelated to the actual path of inflation. Since within-store synchronization

does not mirror the inflationary process the reasons for its existence lie somewhere else.

        The above arguments can be depicted grapblcally once we restrict the process {Xj to be iid

over stores, products and time. Then 'p and     ;   are   identically distributed for any i, j and t. Figure

5 shows the histograms of 'p andX in the sample. Note that for both wines and meat products, the

distribution of 'p has thicker tails than the distribution of X. In particular, the mass at 0 and at 1, is

signiftcantly higher for 'p than fbr X. As mentioned above, if the observed pattern of 'p merely

reflected the inflationary process, the same should be true of X. Figure 5 strongly rejects this

possibility.

        If the unconditional probability of a price change is the same across products, then, under the

null hypothesis, the number of price changes in each store at any month should be distributed as a

binomial random variable with parameters k and the common probability P_ or P for wines and

meat products, respectively!4 Table 5 indicates that this assumption may be appropriate for our data

and, in fact, we can estimate P and P either by; averaged over products or by the average of i)

over products.

        As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the most compelling evidence in favor of

within-store synchronization in the timing of price changes is given by the frequent occurrence of the

events cp = 0 and 'p =    I.   We are now in a position to compare the observed frequencies of these

events (Table 4) with the expected frequency under the binomial asswnption.

        For each value of GI         3 and for every moath we compute the binomial probabilities of

observing zero and GJ price changes using the estimated P, and P,,, These probabilities are

multiplied by the number of stores selling I Gj products to obtain the expected frequency of zero or

 I Oj price changes in each month. Within-store synchronization predicts that the observed

frequencies will be higher than the expected ones. Table 7 corroborates this prediction.

B. Pairwise correlation in the timing of once changes

        So far our approach to the measurement of within-store synchronization captures behavior

within a period. Another — perhaps more dynamic — approach is the co-evolution of two different

products j and k, X and X1, within each store over time. An additional implication of pairwise

independence in the timing of price changes is that the covariance over time between any two pairs of

products sold in the same store is zero. This issue is analyzed in this subsection, thereby putting

together, in some sense, the concept of regular cyclicity with the static notion of within-store

synchronization.

        We focus our analysis on the behavior of the cross-product                  We define the indicator

function Sjj,k) as follows: when both products behave similarly S(j,k) = 1; else Sk(j,k) = 0. That

is,wheneitherbothX, = X1, =        lorX =      X11,   =0,S(j,k) =    1.    ThemeanvalueofSj(j,k)over
time, S.jj,k), is the proportion of synchronization or matching between two products jand Ic in stone
                                                                                                                    30



         Over all stores and pairs of distinct products we obtained 579 and 1069 SLQ,k)'S kr wines

and meat products, respectively. Table 8 displays features of the distribution of SL(J,k). Recall that

within-store synchronization implies "high' values of 5L

         A rough benchmark figure fbr the expected proportion of matchings, Sjj,k), under the

assumption of no within-store synchronization can be obtained from Table 5. For wines we are led to

expect an S(j,k) around 0.0576 (= 0.242) and no larger than 0.0961 (= 0.312), while kr meat

products Sjj,k) should hover around 0.281 (= 0.532) and no more than 0.384 (0.622). It is clear that

the observed proportions of matchings are larger than the expected ones.

         Clearly, meat products and wines do not behave in the same way. Recall that we are

analyzing the same time period in each product so that the stores selling these products operate in the

same macroeconomic environment. It may be that aggregate variables, such as those related to

monetary expansion, or even the average rate of inflation, transmit into meat products with much

more noise. In other words, meat products are subject to more idiosyncratic shocks. This may be




       This, of course, does not constitute a formal testing procedure. Within-store synchronization means that the

a price change in goods j and It. ris               t covaS over tint between X, and X4] is zero. Testing

responsible, at least in part, for the fact that synchronization within the store is not as complete in

stores selling meat product as it is in liquor stores.



5. Nentive and positive Drice changes

         This section examines the co-existence of positive and negative nominal price changes within

the store. The phenomenon of negative nominal changes during a period of high inflation is

interesting. With an Inflation rate of about 3.9 percent a month, one Is tempted to think that very few

nominal prices, if any, are likely to adjust downward. Our data show that this is not so. About 12

percent of all changes in our sample are downward changes in this period (It.! percent in meat

products and 14.7 percent in wines).

         In the literature on equilibrium distributions of real prices the assumption of relative two-sided

(idiosyncratic) shocks is usually invoked to generate a stable distribution of the relative prices. It is

therefore comforting to know that even when aggregate shocks generate a fairly high rate of inflation,

there seems to be evidence pointing towards the presence of Idiosyncratic shocks in the opposite

direction.' Note, however, that a downward adjustment of nominal prices cannot, by itself, Imply

the existence of idiosyncratic shocks. It Is the co-existence of price reductions of individual products

and a positive and stable inflationary process that suggests the presence of strong idiosyncratic shocks

in addition to the aggregate shock?"


       Tsiddon (1993) and Caballero and Engel (1991) present models based on two-sided shocks.

       Recall that the standard deviation of the monthly rate of inflation is 1.9 percent. To ace whether negative
shocks come from a distribution of idiosyncratic shocks or from aggregate shocks we ran a serie, of regressions
of the number of negative nominal price changes across all stores on the unexpected component of inflation (both
in linear and in linear-quadratic forms). We could not detect • single equation that shown negative coefficient.
Negative price changes are not related to negative surprises in the rate of inflation. We therefore conclude that the
source for these changes is idiosyncratic.

   "An alternative interpretation may be the occurrence of 'salee not related to shocks of any type. CssuaI

                                                                                                           32
         We have argued before that within-store synchronization can result from the existence of

store-specific costs of adjusting prices. However, there may be other explanations for this

observation. One competing hypothesis is that monetary shocks are distributed unevenly across

geographical regions. As we shall see, the timing of the negative nominal price changes offers a

viable way of contrasting the two hypotheses.

         Suppose there exist idiosyncratic shocks that are independently distributed across products as

welt as across stores. Suppose that a store observes' a negative shock in the market for product j.

If there were no store-specific component to the costs of adjusting prices, then the store would adjust
the price of product j downward only at the moment the product-specific negative shock arrives. This

implies that the timing of negative price changes is uncorrelated with the tuning of positive price

changes.

        If a negative shock to a particular product in a specific store coincides with a positive regional

monetary shock affecting the store - the unevenly distributed shock — then there are weaker

incentives to accommodate the negative idiosyncratic shock since it is partly or fitly compensated for

by the positive regional shock. In this case, the timing of negative and positive changes in prices

within a store ought to be necativelv correlated.

        All the above implications hold under the assumption of no store-specific adjustment costs. If

there are store-specific costs to changing prices, the store should try to bunch together negative and

positive changes in prices, imj,lying a nositive correlation between the timing of positive and negative

price changes.

        Figure 6 presents the degree to which the timing of positive and negative price changes

coincide. The horizontaj axis shows the proportion of negative price changes that occur

simultaneously (in the same month) with positive price changes within the same store. The vertical

axis indicates the frequency counts. In 40 stores all negative price changes coincided with positive

price changes. In II stores there were negative price changes only when there were no positive

ones. We interpret the left-skewness of Figure 6 as favoring the menu-cost explanation of the

existence of within-store synchronization over the explanation of a geographically uneven macro

shock.



6. Interpretation of the evidence

         Our analysis of the data indicates that the timing of price changes is synchronized within each

store but that stores are staggered over time in quoting new prices. We believe that these findings

lend greater support to some theories of price dynamics than to others. In this section we comment

on how different theories fit these results.



A. Menu costs models

         The menu cost paradigm is consistent with our findings when these adjustment costs satisfy

the following requirements: (i) they are significant to the seller, in the sense that they are not to be

incurred continuously, and (ii) some component of these costs Is store-specific. The adjustment costs

are, therefore, not exclusively a result of the characteristics of each product but also of the

characteristics of the price-seuer. This last requirement will induce a store to synchronize its price

changes. The term menu cost comes alive: the cost of printing a new menu is shared by all

products. If such store-specific costs are indeed important, then single-product menu cost models

may give a very distorted picture of price dynamics.

         Note, however, that store-specific costs should induce synchronization only in the timing of

price changes, but should not carry implications as to the size of the price changes for individual

products. This justifies our focus on the synchronization In the timing of such changes.



B. Inftrrnational externalities

          Another explanation that fits the within-store synchronization of price changes is based on

informational externalities. Bait and Cecchetti (1988) discuss a mechanism in which each price-setter

derives information on inflationary pressures from observing the decisions made by other price-setters

when they change prices. They show that such an externality can generate an equilibrium with

staggered price-setting.

          This explanation does not contradict the menu cost hypothesis. In conjunction with the menu

cost explanation, it amplifies the within-store-synchronization phenomenon, and yields an intuitive and

plausible mechanism that explains staggering across stores.



C. Sivial extraction models

          Lucas's (1973) explanation that stores change most of their prices in response to a

macroeconomic shock, e.g., an unexpected monetary expansion, does not fit the data well. If the

shock is perceived by all agents at the same time (i.e., if there is no asymmetric information) all

stores will respond in a synchronized fashion, leading to across-store synchronization. The lack of

synchronization observed in Figures 1 does not support this implication. It would be very difficult to

suggest a convincing argument whereby macro shocks lead to within-store synchronization but not to

across-store synchronization. Hence, within-store synchronization cannot be the result of macro

shocks.

          One way of reconciling this model with the findings is that the effects of macro shock are

unevenly distributed geographically, say, with different factor loadings in different locations. Moving

away from a pure macro shock can potentially generate the across-store staggering and within-store
                                                                                                       35

synchronization observed in the data. This explanation was considered in Section 5, where we

documented the coexistence of positive and negative price changes within the same store. The data

seem to reject the geographic hypothesis as well.

        We do not interpret the data as suggesting that the effects of partial information on price

dynamics are minimal. The data only suggest that at high rates of inflation the economic implications

of incomplete information are overshadowed by the economic implications of the existence of friction

in setting new prices. Thus, this is simply another costly aspect of inflation: at high rates of inflation

price-setters must pay more attention to frictions than to gathering and processing information.

Inflation therefore makes price-setting a more mechanical process. We will return to this issue later.



D. Sticker once model

        Diamond (1993) proposes yet another mechanism to Justify the sluggishness of the aggregate

price level: identical products may have different prices since prices are set at the time of delivery to

the store and remain unchanged unless a crucial change in the environment occurs. Our data do not

support this hypothesis; for it to be consistent with our findings one needs to assume that all products

are delivered simultaneously to each store so as to generate within-store synchronization, and that

there is a non-degenerate distribution of delivery dates across stores. This distribution should be

widely spread-out in order to generate the observed across-stores staggering in the timing of price

changes, which was defined on a monthly basis. These are strong assumptions, that are unlikely to

hold for the type of products analyzed here.



E. Search theory

        In L&T we showed that the price dispersion in each Qiomogeneous) product market is very

large. Consequently, consumers have incentives to search for the lowest price. There Is, in fact, a
                                                                                                         36

rich literature connecting search theory to inflation but most of its implications cannot be addressed

with our data.

        Search, however, is not confined to consumers only. In an Inflationary and uncertain

environment, sellers also are not folly aware of nominal price changes and, therefore, every new

price quotation brings new information on market conditions to consumers and sellers alike.

        To the best of our knowledge no model exists, as yet, in which consumers and sellers search

in the context of multiproduct rums. Hence, we can only conjecture about the constraints such a

model would impose on the data. In broad terms and mainly from an Information-gathering

perspective, staggering price changes within the firm amounts to following a sequential search

procedure; synchronization of price changes is analogous to a fixed sample search approach. It is

well known that, under fairly general conditions, sequential search is a better strategy. In our dataset,

nevertheless, we find that stores synchronize the timing of their products' price changes, i.e., they

choose the fixed sample approach.

        Two possible explanations of this paradox can be advanced. First, the environment may be

very volatile and little, or nothing, can be inferred from observations of one product on the others.

Second, the existence of frictions at the store-level make the staggering of price changes a very costly

alternative. Both explanations are not mutually exclusivç both may render a sequential search

strategy non-optimal.

        Moreover, since relative price volatility is partly attributed to frictions in price setting (L&T),

these frictions seem to have a very close connection to the fact that there is no sequential search.

This, however, is merely another manifestation of what was noted earlier: as inflation increases,

frictions become more important, and behavior becomes more mechanical.

       To sum up. we believe the empirical findings of within-store synchronization and of across-

stores staggering are important because, first, they validate the assumption made in much of the
                                                                                                                   37
  sticky priceC literature that decisions are staggered across price-setters, and not across products.

Second, they provide further empirical support for the conjecture that price rigidity is due to

mechanical reasons, i.e., to menu costs, and not to informational asymmetries. And last, they

indicate that further research on the dynamics of prices should take into account the multiproduct

character of the price-setter.




7. The store-snecific menu costs hynothesis

         Accepting the view that within-store synchronization in the timing of price changes emerges,

at least in part, as   a   result of the existence of a store-specific component in the cost of adjusting a

price quotation raises some interesting issues. Although menu cost models for a multiproduct price-

setter have received little attention from the theoretical perspective,3' we heuristically derive some

simple restrictions on the data by extending the logic of the single product model.

         It is commonly believed that the existence of small price changes constitutes evidence against

the menu cost proposition. It follows that if many small changes are observed, the menu cost

paradigm has very little (if anything) to say about actual price dynamics. This deduction, however, is

not applicable in a multiproduct setting.

         lithe fixed costs associated with the price-setter, relative to those associated with the product,
are the domin'int component, then the well-known (S,s) policy in its narrow definition is no longer

optimal. While prices still change discontinuously, one should expect fairly little regularity in the size

of the price change of each product?2

         To illustrate this point, consider the case in which the only adjustment costs are those attached


        See Sulein (1986) and Sheshinsjcj and Weiss (1992).
    '  This contradicts the conclusion of the single product case. In that case, the (S,s) boundaries an fixed as long
as the chasactexistics of inflation tie fixed. Thus with a (stochastically) stable inflation one expects a constant
proportional change in price.
                                                                                                                   38

to the price-setter. If a decision is made to change prices, then the prices of         all products are changed.

i.e., perfect within-store synchronization is the rule. As long as idiosyncratic shocks are significant

relative to aggregate inflation, when a price-setter decides to change (alt) prices the magnitude of the

change in each product's price can be anything: some prices may change more than others or may

change in opposite directions. The onty common fact is that In all these changes, each price is set to

its optimal level. In addition, if store-specific costs are large, an appropriate weighted-average of

price changes within a store should also be large.n In the more general case, when the costs of

adjustment include a component associated with each product, some prices may not change at all or

may change on different dates, implying less than perfect within-store synchronization, but the rule

that conditional on a change, the average change should be large, still holds.

         Having no information on sales or on the cross-derivatives of the profit function, we use the

arithmetic average of price changes as a proxy for the correct weighted-average of price changes.

Note that we restrict ourselves to positive price changes. Let DP1,          be the percentage change in the

price of product j in store i during month t and select those observations for which DPijt > 0. The

average change within store i Is given by DP11,



                                               DP = -i    E DPu                                                 (10)

              Since the average monthly inflation rate was 3.9 percent, we could use this number to define

 a "smalr price change. In wines, 15.5 percent of the average price changes are small while in meat

products the corresponding figure is 9.1 percent." A comparison of each DP1 to the corresponding

monthly rate of aggregate inflation (CPI) indicates that 11 percent of the changes in liquor stores are

less than the inflation rate, while fbr stores selling meat products this figure is 14 percent. In sum,

only between 10 and 15 of all avenge price changes are "small according to the definition

employed.

              While small price changes in specific products are not evidence against menu cost models in

the multiproduct firm setting, the fact that small average changes within each store are infrequent

reconfinns our previous conclusion that the phenomenon of within-store synchronization is, at least in

part, due to significant store-specific menu costs.

              Theory provides other restrictions that should be satisfied by the data if within-store

synchronization is related to store-specific menu costs. The main implication is that DP should be

positively affected by expected inflation and not related to unexpected inflation. In fact, the mean

of DP over all stores and months increases from 9.8 percent in 1978-1979:6 to 11.9 percent in 1981-

1982. At the same time, the average monthly inflation rate mounted from 3.9 percent to 7 percent.

8. Conclusion

          A price-setter usually sets prices for many different products. This obvious fact is an aspect

of price-setting behavior which has been neglected in most of the theoretical and empirical work on

the subject. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to this issue. We do this by empirically

investigating a rich body of data on prices of meat products and wines collected at the store level in

Israel.

          The data show that when stores - price-setters    - change prices, they change the prices of
most of the products they sell. That is, there exists within-store synchronization in the timing of price

changes. In addition, stores are staggered in the timing of their price changes. These findings justify

the use of staggered price-setting mechanisms in the debate over the role of monetary policy.

          We also contrast the implications of some of the prominent models of price-setting behavior

with the data. Among the potential explanations, the one suggested by the menu cost model seems to

be the one most consistent with the data. While we do not formally test the menu cost model against

the other alternatives models we tend to conclude that, at least for foodstuffs, the menu cost approach
