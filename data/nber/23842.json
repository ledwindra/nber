    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimated the average returns, in terms of patient survival, to the marginal innovations in oral chemotherapy market induced by Part D expansion of oral chemotherapy coverage for elderly individuals by mandating inclusion of \u201call or substantially all\u201d oral anti-cancer medications on plans\u2019 formularies. We exploited exogenous variation in the age of diagnosis for different cancer sites - and therefore the relative expansion in market size for different cancers under the Medicare\u2019s prescription drug coverage \u2013 to isolate the effect of Part D on innovation and the health benefits that these innovative technologies provide. Using data from FDA and clinical studies from January 1994 to December 2016, we find that the approval rate for oral chemotherapies increased an additional 5.7% (95% CI: 1.7, 9.8) after implementation of Part D for every 1% increase in exposure to the Medicare market.  In contrast, greater exposure to Medicare was associated with a smaller increase in the indication-specific survival gains reported in the drug\u2019s label (3.2% [95% CI: 2.1, 4.3]) and 8.0% [95% CI: 6.1, 9.8] lower in absolute and relative gains, respectively).   Similar trends were not observed for intravenously administered chemotherapy whose coverage was largely unaffected by Part D.  These findings suggest that there could be diminishing returns to incentives for pharmaceutical innovation created by broad coverage mandates and that health policy tools, such as value\u2013based pricing, may help maximize the health benefits provided by future pharmaceutical innovations.\n\n",
