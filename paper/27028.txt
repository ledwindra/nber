Estimating the Fraction of Unreported Infections in Epidemics with a Known Epicenter: an
Application to COVID-19

JEL No. C00,I18
ABSTRACT
We develop an analytically tractable method to estimate the fraction of unreported infections in
epidemics with a known epicenter and estimate the number of unreported COVID-19 infections
in the US during the first half of March 2020. Our method utilizes the covariation in initial
reported infections across US regions and the number of travelers to these regions from the
epicenter, along with the results of an early randomized testing study in Iceland. Using our
estimates of the number of unreported infections, which are substantially larger than the number
of reported infections, we also provide estimates for the infection fatality rate using data on
reported COVID-19 fatalities from U.S. counties.

Introduction

The global pandemic COVID-19 is here in the United States. The number of confirmed
cases is rising rapidly, reaching 398,809 as of April 7 with 12,895 reported deaths. The
coronavirus outbreak was declared a national emergency beginning March 11 . More
than half of U.S. states have imposed various levels of lockdown measures2 . In addition
to the public health crisis, the country is certainly looking at a deep and possibly longlasting economic recession, according to Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen in a recent
Financial Times article3 .
Given the level of severity of current conditions, a basic yet important question
remains to be answered: How many people are actually infected with COVID-19 in
the U.S. and what is the true fatality rate? Because of the shortage in testing kits,
hospitals and disease control centers were only able to test the subsample of people
with severe symptoms or travel history. The number of reported infections, especially
early on in the course of the pandemic, is likely much lower than the actual number of
infections in the U.S. Indeed, these unreported infections can be unrecognized because
they often experience mild or no symptoms (Nishiura et al., 2020; Andrei, 2020). If
not hospitalized or quarantined, they can infect a large proportion of the population.
Thus, estimating the number of unreported infections can inform policy-makers about
the proper scale of virus control policies (Alvarez et al., 2020; Eichenbaum et al.,
2020), and to assess the effectiveness of public health policies such as social distancing
in slowing the spread of the epidemic.
Estimating the number of unreported infections may also give a more accurate
measure of the infection fatality rate (IFR). The widely reported case fatality rate
(CFR), reports the rate of fatalities from reported cases of infection. The infection
fatality rate is the proportion of those actually infected who die, not of those reported
or confirmed infected. The reported case fatality rate is likely an overestimate of the
true infection fatality rate, due to selection bias in testing.
Ideally, a randomized testing experiment will give an unbiased estimate of the IFR.
However, given the limited supply of testing kits and surging demand by people with
symptoms, randomized testing may be infeasible, especially in the early periods of the
outbreak. Therefore, it may be of great value to estimate the fraction of unreported
infections with observational data at hand. With that knowledge, policy-makers will
be better equipped to assess the proper level and duration of virus control policies.
In this paper we develop an analytically tractable method that utilizes data on travel

patterns to identify and estimate the fraction of unreported infections for situations
where the epidemic has a known epicenter. Our methodological strategy, described in
Section 3, exploits the covariation between the number of initial reported infections
in locations away from the epicenter, and the number of travelers from the epicenter
to these locations. While we do not see our method as a substitute for the “goldstandard” of well defined randomized/universal testing studies, we believe our method
can be useful towards providing estimates of unreported infections when results of
randomized testing studies are not available for a given location of interest.
To begin illustrating the idea, consider a time period when the epicenter is the only
location with infections, and that the only way another city/country can be infected is
through travelers. Also assume, as in Section 3.1, that any infected travelers can only
come from the unreported infected population in the epicenter – an assumption we find
reasonable (as reported infected individuals would not be allowed to travel), but are
able to relax in Section 3.2. Suppose now the hypothetical situation where we know the
reporting rate of infections in the epicenter (the fraction of reported infections to the
true number of infections), and that we know the number of travelers from the epicenter
to another city/country. Assuming travelers resemble the population of the epicenter,
we can calculate the expected number of infected (but unreported) travelers entering
other cities/countries. Assuming further that we know the rate of transmission of the
disease, we can then calculate the expected number of infections these travelers will
have generated in these locations. Comparing the expected number of infections that
arise from travelers to reported cases of the infection, we can estimate the reporting
rate.
What can we do in the realistic case if the reporting rate in the epicenter is unknown? In Section 3.1, we propose the following: suppose we make the assumption
that the reporting rate at the epicenter and the previously uninfected city/country are
the same (or a known function of each other). We can then start with a guess on the
unknown rate of reporting at the epicenter, which allows us to calculate the implied
reporting rate at the previously uninfected city/country, and check whether these are
equal (or satisfy the known function). If not, we update our guess, and try again.
In other words, we can solve for the reporting rate(s) balancing the expected number
of infections from travel and the number of infected that are being reported in both
locations.
While the above strategy, outlined in Section 3.1, is in principle implementable
using only data on travel patterns and reported cases, it is crucially dependent on the
assumption that reporting rates are the same across the epicenter and destination locations (or a known function of each other). Moreover, its results are very sensitive
to knowing the transmission rate of the infection from travelers, as this allows us to

3

project the number of infections in the destination city/country of interest. However,
suppose now that we have access to the reporting rate of infections from another destination city/country, e.g. through universal or randomized testing, as has been done
in Iceland.4 This allows us to estimate how infectious the travelers from the epicenter are. Assuming that this transmission rate from travelers is the same (or a known
function of) as the transmission rate at the destination city/country of interest, we can
then calculate the expected number of infections we would expect from travel. Intuitively, the ratio between number of travelers to two destination cities/countries from
the epicenter should tell us the ratio of total infections between the two cities/countries.
Randomized or universal testing at one of the destinations, Iceland in our case, will
give us its number of total infections, so total infections at the other destination can
be computed. This strategy is laid out in detail in Section 3.2.
We would like to be very upfront that the estimation strategies outlined above
are dependent on strong assumptions and reliable data on travel patterns, and that
any results are very sensitive to these assumptions. However, our hope is that our
approach is clear in terms of its assumptions and its corresponding limitations; we
hope that future research can improve upon these limitations. We have attempted to
account for some of the limitations. For example, in Section 3.3, we discuss how to
correct for the fact that infections are often reported with a delay, as there is a delay to
the outset of symptoms that are often a prerequisite for testing for the infection, as well
as a delay in laboratory testing. Another important limitation is the assumption that
the city/country with randomized test results has the same transmission rate as the
city/country of interest. Section 5.4 discusses what may be done to address violations
of this assumption.
Our data consists of detailed daily reported infections/deaths for all infected U.S.
counties and Iceland collected by Johns Hopkins University of Medicine Coronavirus
Resource Center from January 22 to April 13, 2020; international travel data to U.S.
in January and February 2020 from I-94 travels data by National Travel and Tourism
Office; international travel data to Iceland by Icelandic Tourist Board in January and
February 2020.
Our model generates a range of estimates that depend on the traveler data that is
incorporated, the date range considered, and assumptions regarding the lags associated
with reported case data. We report this range of estimates in Table 3. Across these
estimates, we find that 4% to 14% of cases were reported across the U.S. up to March
16, when social distancing measures began to be applied in major metropolitan areas
and travel declined significantly (Thompson et al., 2020) . This estimate assumes that
4

Of course, another strategy is to assume that the reporting rate discovered through randomized testing
in Iceland is the same in the destination city/country of interest.

4

cases are reported with a lag of 8 days as in Table 3(a); that is, we do not treat
reported cases of today as the appropriate measure of true infections today.5

6

This

suggests that for each case reported in late February/early March, between 6 to 24 cases
remained unreported (after accounting for an 8 day lag from infection to reporting of
a case).
How do these estimates compare to other estimates in the literature? A very recent
study by Bendavid et al. (2020) tested a representative sample of Santa Clara county
residents in early April and reports that 48,000 -81,000 people are infected as of April
1, whereas only 956 are reported that day. This leads to their reported ratio of 50-85 of
total infections to reported infections. Importantly, this calculation does not account
for the lag in reporting infections. Our data allows us to compute a similar statistic
for San Francisco County, which we report in Table 2; we obtain this by dividing our
estimate of the true infected by the reported infected on that day. For March 13,
this yields a ratio of 85, which is at the upper bound of the 50-85 range reported by
Bendavid et al. (2020).
Our estimates of the number of total infections also allow us to estimate the infection fatality rates implied by observed data on fatalities. These calculations are
reported in detail in Section 5.5, and reported in Table 2. We estimate a median cumulative infection fatality rate (cIFR) of 0.27-0.31% across U.S. counties. We note
that a representative sample study in Santa Clara County by (Bendavid et al., 2020)
found an infection fatality rate of 0.12-0.2%. Our estimates show, however, potentially
substantial dispersion of IFR across U.S. counties. Once again, we would like to stress
that our estimates are highly dependent on model assumptions, and the data that is
used to inform it. We discuss how our results depend on these assumptions in some
detail in Section 5 and in the Supplemental Information section.
In the economic literature, Berger et al. (2020) and Stock (2020) study the importance of unreported cases in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Our paper
contributes to the growing literature in epidemiology on estimating the true number
of infections using observational data and structural model assumptions. Notably, (Li
et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Flaxman et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a,b; Nishiura et al.,
2020) utilize simulated epidemiological models to estimate the fraction of unreported
infections in China and European countries. As Zhao et al. (2020) notes, it is often
difficult to identify the fraction of unreported alongside the growth of the infection
purely by measures of fit. Our paper complements these extant papers: we provide
5

A shorter assumed reporting lag of e.g. 5 days generates a range of estimated reporting rates between
1.5% to 10%.

The estimates use travel data from China, Italy, Spain, Germany, and the UK. We have excluded King
county, Washington in these results because this county, containing Seattle, shows much earlier community
infections than other regions in U.S.

5

what we believe is a transparent identification argument and a very light computational
strategy that allows researchers to assess the sensitivity of model estimates to modeling and data assumptions. That said, our model may miss important components
of disease dynamics that these more sophisticated epidemiological models incorporate.
These richer models may also allow one to estimate a richer set of model parameters
than we have been able to.7 Another related recent paper is Imai et al. (2020), who
estimate potential total cases in Wuhan China from the confirmed cases in other countries due to international travel, assuming that all cases outside of China are reported
correctly 8 . Korolev (2020) discusses non-identification in SEIRD models and proposes
estimation strategy conditional on knowing infectious period and incubation period.
Section 2 introduces our model of infection, which describes the early stages of
the dynamics of the epidemic. Section 3 presents our two estimation/identification
strategies. Section 4 describes the data we are using for estimation. Section 5 lays out
the estimation results and our robustness checks.

Model

Our model is based on the classic SIR model in epidemiology. We consider the evolution
of the virus in both the epicenter c and into target city i over a period of time T0 ≤
t ≤ T1 . We are considering a relative short period of time in the early stage of the
epidemics. Thus, the “recovered” population at the epicenter, which is a small fraction
of the population, is assumed not to play a significant role during this period.

2.1

What happens at the epicenter c

We denote Infected, Reported Infected, and Unreported Infected in time t and epicenter
c as Ic,t , Rc,t , Uc,t respectively.
The epicenter starts with some initial infections Ic,0 . We are considering a short
period of time in between T0 and T1 , so the number of susceptibles at the epicenter
remain relatively constant throughout this period. There are also no infected cases
traveling into epicenter. We assume no recovery. So at time t, the total infections at
epicenter with transmission rate β is given by
7

For example, that Li et al. (2020) estimates different transmission rates for reported vs. unreported
infections, which we are unable to identify with our strategy. Li et al. (2020) assume that unreported
infected individuals transmit the disease at a slower rate than reported infected individuals. However, since
most reported infections are either hospitalized or self-quarantined, it is not clear whether this assumption
is an a priori reasonable one.
8
Bogoch et al. (2020) and Lai et al. (2020) calculates how vulnerable countries are to the virus by the
magnitude of travelers from Wuhan, and correlate these vulnerability/risk measures with reported cases in
these countries.

6

Ic,t = Ic,0 exp(β(t − T0 ))

(1)

It is worth noting that this β term can include the spread minus recoveries, since
we do not model a changing number of susceptibles. It should be viewed as the net
spread of infections over time.
Each time t, there is a cohort of travelers Mi,t going from epicenter to target city
and potentially bringing the virus to target city.

2.2

What happens in target city i

We denote Infected, observed Reported Infected, and Unreported Infected in time t
and city i as Ii,t , Ri,t , Ui,t respectively. At period T0 , target city i has zero infections,
so Ii,T0 = Ri,T0 = Ui,T0 = 0.
Each time t ∈ [T0 , T1 ], target city receives a cohort t of incoming travelers Mi,t
inc are infected. Each cohort of incoming
from the epicenter. Among these travelers, Ii,t
inc will transmit the virus in target city with rate β for the period of [t, T ].

sets of data that could potentially be available: (i) data on travel from epicenter to
U.S., and (ii) data from a randomized testing implemented outside of U.S. In Section
3.3, we extend our model and estimation strategy to incorporate reporting lags.

3.1

Travel data available but randomized testing data un-

available
When only travel data is available, we need the assumption that people capable of
traveling away from the epicenter would be the uninfected and the unreported infected.
This is a reasonable assumption especially in the case of COVID-19 because the great
majority of reported infected individuals would be quarantined and not allowed to
travel.
Our main assumption in this scenario is:
Assumption 3.1.
inc
Ii,t
Mi,t

=

Uc,t
Nc − R̂c,t

for any time t ∈ [T0 , T1 ], city i and epicenter c

(4)

Nc is the population of epicenter. R̂c,t is the observed reported infections at epicenter c time t, defined analogously to R̂i,t for target city i. In other words, we are
assuming that the fraction of unreported infections among incoming travelers from the
epicenter is the same as the fraction of unreported infections among people capable of
leaving the epicenter. (We will relax this assumption in Section 3.2.) Since α remains
constant,10 we have Uc,t = (1 − α)Ic,t =

inc
Ii,t
Mi,t

=

(1 − α)Ic,t
Nc − R̂c,t

1−α
α Rc,t .

Therefore, assumption 3.1 becomes:

∀t ∈ [T0 , T1 ], city i, epicenter c

(5)

Plugging equation (1) in, we get

inc
Ii,t
=

(1 − α)Ic,0 exp(β(t − T0 ))
Nc − R̂c,t

Mi,t

∀t ∈ [T0 , T1 ], city i, epicenter c

(6)

Plugging back to equation (3), we get
10

In reality α may be varying over time, due to e.g. changes in the extensiveness of testing. If this is the
case, as we vary the [T0 , T1 ] window, we will obtain window-specific estimates of α, which can be thought of
as a weighted average of α during this period.

This equation allows us to solve for (1−α) exp(β(T1 −T0 ) if we observe Rc,0 . We will
allow for observing Rc,0 with error in Section 3.2. We can estimate β from the growth
of reported infections in the epicenter because there is no influx of infected people from
other regions. Given that β is now determined, we can solve for α. However, there is
much variation in estimation of β within the literature, and our estimate of α varies
with point estimates of β (Liu et al., 2020; Read et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020).

3.2

When travel data and a random testing benchmark

are available
In this scenario, we will be leveraging the same fact that the number of incoming
unreported infections is informed by the travelers from the epicenter. Now we can also
allow for selection in traveling. More specifically, if we think that e.g. urban areas
are likely to have a higher infection rate than rural areas and travel abroad more11 ,
then assumption 3.1 might not hold. Therefore, we introduce a bias correction term
γ in the relation between the fraction of infected among travelers and the fraction of
unreported infected individuals in the general population. This bias correction term γ
can also account for the fact that a fraction of the unreported infected people might
be too sick to travel. Our relaxed assumption in this scenario is:
Assumption 3.2.
inc
Ii,t
Mi,t

= γ

Uc,t
Nc − R̂c,t

for any time t ∈ [T0 , T1 ], city i and epicenter c, γ 6= 0(11)

We can further allow for the fact that the reporting rate in epicenter αc can be
different from that of region i, so Uc,t = (1 − αc )Ic,t =
assumption 3.2 as:
11

This is likely to be true in epicenters like China.

We can now rewrite

(13)

The additional parameters for the bias correction term γ and different reporting
rate for the epicenter complicate the estimation of α using travel data alone. However,
having data from a country that has done randomized or complete testing greatly
helps overcome this challenge. In our case, we are able to identify α using additional
information given by the randomized testing benchmark provided by Iceland. Since
the Iceland company deCODE genetics implemented random testing of COVID-19 for
a representative sample of the island population12 , we are able to observe true infection
rate of Iceland at time T1 . Multiplying this true infection rate by the population of
region j in Iceland will give us the actual number of infections in region j at time T1 ,
which is Ij,T1 . Thus, for any region j in Iceland we observe Ij,T1 − Ij,T0 , which in turn,
equals the infections generated by travelers from the epicenter:
Ij,T1 − Ij,T0 =

1 − αc
γ exp(β(T1 − T0 ))Rc,0
αc

Z

T1

T0

Mj,t
Nc − R̂c,t

(14)

Note that if we allow for iid measurement error j in observing Ij,T1 −Ij,T0 , we can get
a consistent estimate of

1−αc
αc γ

exp(β(T1 − T0 ))Rc,0 by estimating equation (14). If we

don’t allow for measurement error j , then we can estimate

1−αc
αc γ

exp(β(T1 − T0 ))Rc,0

c
with no error. Estimating equation (13) gives consistent estimate of α 1−α
αc γ exp(β(T1 −

T0 ))Rc,0 . Taking the ratio, we have identified α.
One intuition for this strategy is the following: the ratio between travel to U.S.
and travel to Iceland from the epicenter should tell us the ratio of total infections
between U.S. and Iceland. Iceland’s randomized testing gives us its number of total
infections, so U.S. total infections can be computed. In other words, we observe the
outcome in U.S. with under-reporting, and the unobserved counterfactual outcome
with full reporting is given by the benchmark Iceland. An additional advantage of this
estimation/identification strategy, as opposed to the previous strategy in section 3.1,
is that now we don’t need an estimate of β in order to recover α. We also allow for the
fact that Rc,0 could be observed with error. Identifying α does not require observing
12

We will describe the randomized testing in detail in Section 4

10

Rc,0 perfectly because Rc,0 appears identically in both equations.
We should be clear that for terms with β to cancel out, the argument does assume
that β is the same across Iceland and the U.S. We believe this might be a reasonable assumption for the early periods of the infection when social distancing or other
widespread measures had not yet been implemented (in a potentially differential fashion). In the case of heterogeneous transmission rate, we show in the supplements how
to estimate them if we have high quality travel data. We also need the bias term γ to
be the same for US and Iceland; this means that proportion of (unreported) infected
travelers from China to the U.S. and Iceland are the same. More detailed micro-data
on travelers may be used to assess the validity of this assumption.
This estimation strategy also works when a complete testing benchmark exists.
If the whole population of region j is tested, then we observe Ij,T1 − Ij,T0 trivially.
Equation (14) still gives consistent estimate of

1−αc
αc γ

exp(β(T1 − T0 ))Rc,0 and the rest

of the argument follows.
Note that if in the model reported infections and unreported infections have different
transmission rates, then our strategy would not be able to capture the differential rates.
We would need other sources of information to help us pin down these differential rates.

3.3

Incorporating Reporting Lags

In this section, we show how our model can incorporate a fixed reporting lag in reported
infections and derive identification equations. Reporting lags are important, because
if people are tested for the virus only after symptoms show up, there will be a lag in
reported infections. Another major reason for reporting lag is the lag in testing results.
The turnaround time for testing results in U.S. major laboratory companies could be
2 to 3 days (Kaplan and Thomas, 2020).
We denote true infected, true reported infected, and true unreported infected
in time t and target city i as Ii,t , Ri,t , Ui,t respectively.

Those for epicenter c as

Ic,t , Rc,t , Uc,t . Let k be the lagged report period. At time t city i denote the lagged
reported infected LRi,t = Ri,t−k . For epicenter c, lagged reported infected is LRc,t =

and at epicenter c as αc =

This means that we are considering the reporting rate of lagged re-

ported cases as a fraction of the lagged total infections, not the current total infections.
We derive an alternative definition of reporting rate as lagged reported cases over current total infections in the supplement.
When travel data are available but randomized testing data unavailable, we still

Data

4.1

COVID-19 Data

Daily reported infections, recovery, and death data are collected by Johns Hopkins
University of Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center from January 22 to April 13,
2020. We use data for all U.S. counties as well as epicenters.
Randomized testing data in Iceland is obtained from the website maintained by
the Directorate of Health and the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency
Management in Iceland13 . We have daily number of tests conducted by deCODE
genetics and daily number of confirmed cases. We use the first wave of randomized
testing by deCODE which spans March 15 - 19, 2020. During the first wave they
13

https://www.covid.is/data

12

performed 5490 tests and confirmed 48 cases, which implies an infection rate of .874%.
The randomized testing conducted was random over non-confirmed individuals which
made up a very tiny portion of the Icelandic population at this time. This could lead to
slightly downward biases in our Iceland confirmed data, slightly biasing our US alpha
estimates upward.
In our main estimation we consider February 23 as T0 and March 10 as T1 with
a 5 day lag, and T1 as Mar 13 for an 8 day lag. This is because there were very few
infections in January and early February. We check robustness of different time periods
in Section 5.3.

4.2

Travel Data

We obtain monthly data of international arrivals to U.S. by port of entry and country of
origin from I-94 Arrivals by National Travel and Tourism Office. We use the number of
visitors from China, Italy, Spain, UK, and Germany in January and February 2020 as
the measure for incoming travelers to U.S. states. For international arrivals to Iceland,
we get the number of visitors from China, Italy, Spain, UK, and Germany in January
and February 2020 from the Icelandic Tourist Board. We have not been able to obtain
March travel data into either country.
The National Travel and tourism office of the United States provides monthly data
for entry by port of entry, as well as a separate data set for country of origin. We
construct the number of visitors from China, Italy, Spain, Germany, and the UK by
scaling the port-of-entry data by the percentage of total visitors that are from these
countries. This introduces error, as we cannot observe directly the number of e.g.
Chinese travelers into a particular city or state. It is also important to note that we
do not observe inter-state travel. While this may not be important for the immediate
infections caused by travelers from the epicenter, our projections for the number of
infections for T1 that are far removed from T0 will be less accurate due to interstate
travel.
For Icelandic data, 99% of international travelers arrive through Keflavik airport
into Iceland. The data contains a breakdown of arrival by country of origin, broken
down by month of arrival. We use January and February arrival data from China,
Italy, Spain, UK, and Germany for estimation.
Our travel data for both countries does not control for connecting flights. However
the United States data is limited to the top-30 port of entries, many of which are
large urban cities for which there will be less connecting flights. Further work that
can obtain more precise estimates of entry may be able to control for this. In the case
of Iceland: a survey conducted by the Icelandic Tourist Board suggests that 2-5% of

13

international travelers are aboard connecting flights, suggesting it is less of a problem
for this set of data.

4.3

Population Data

Estimates of U.S. State and county population data come from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Data for the populations of China, Iceland, Italy, Spain, UK, and Germany as of 2020
are obtained from the United Nations Population Division.

Empirical Application

5.1

Implementation

We now consider estimation of αU S using randomized sampling in Iceland, as described
in Section 3.2. Randomized sampling done by deCODE genetics gives a percentage
of the population that has contracted the virus. We estimate equation (14) using
Randomized Testing to construct Ij,T1 −k . We do not have city-level travel data into
Iceland. 99% of all international travel arrives through a single airport, and while
the data provided is accurate, this gives only a single data point for estimation. As a
result, equation (14) relies on a single data point of travel and infection, but exp(β(T1 −
R T1 Mj,t
c
dt.
T0 ))γ 1−α
αc Rc,0 is estimated without error by the ratio of Ij,T1 − Ij,T0 and T0
Nc −R̂c,t

For estimation of reporting rates in the U.S., we need estimates of several figures:
Firstly Mj,t , and secondly of Ij,T1 − Ij,T0 . We discuss the estimation of these here.
We observe only monthly travel data to construct Mj,t , and to maintain robustness to
January travels and infections, we average February and January travel into both the
United States and Iceland. We assume that Mj,t is uniform over the entire time period
R F eb29
such that Jan1 Mj,t is equal to the sum of all travel into the city from January and
R T Mj,t
February. Thus the integral T01
varies only due to the confirmed infections
Nc −R̂c,t

increasing over time. Estimation of Ij,T1 is complicated due to randomized testing by
Iceland only being conducted at certain dates. To resolve this problem, we scale the
Iceland randomized results by the scale of the confirmed cases against March 15. This
means that if there were half the confirmed cases in March 5 as in March 15, the total
infections would be half of the randomized testing percent times the population of
Iceland. This allows for us to consider T1 closer to the onset of the infection than the
randomized testing dates. We also remove the number of infected from Wuhan China
from our data on confirmed infected in China due to the lock-down restrictions placed
on this city. We use the first wave of deCODE testing to determine the percentage of
the population that has contracted the disease. This testing took place during Mar

14

15 through Mar 19. The results show that .874% of the population of Iceland have
contracted the disease as of Mar 1514 .
We estimate equation (13) using multiple data points from U.S. states and counties.
c
We obtain our estimate of α exp(β(T1 −T0 ))γ 1−α
αc Rc,0 via OLS without a constant term.

One important note is that if the magnitude of measurement error in travel data were
high, this problem may be alleviated via instrumental variables strategy using other
travel data measured with error.
We then construct our estimate of α by dividing the two estimates. It is important
to note that as a result of the division, this method is not reliant on population data
from the epicenter of infection. As long as γ and β are the same between Iceland and
the United States we will have identified α. It is likely that at the onset of the infection
similar preventative measures have been taken in these two countries, meaning that β
will be reasonably close for each country.
Is China the only epicenter for the United States? While the first confirmed infection in Seattle occurred from a visitor from China, our data on The United States
and Iceland occurs later in the global progression of the virus than our Chinese data.
By the time these countries were experiencing infections, Italy had also experienced
an outbreak. To this end, we also allow for a second epicenter: Italy. Italy is located
much closer to Iceland and constitutes a substantial amount of travel to the country.
However, to maintain identification, we require that α, β and T0 be same for both
China and Italy, and we observe LRc,k for both epicenters with no error. However we
find that allowing T0 to vary does not affect our estimates by much. We also consider
a broader collection of epicenters of China, Italy, Spain, Germany and the UK. For
some collection of epicenters L: Our estimation equation for the United States is given
below.

A similar equation is also estimated with multiple epicenters (China and Italy, also

5.2

Results: Illustration

As a first illustration of our approach, we first estimate α using February 23 as T0 and
March 13 as T1 with a lag of 8 days. We choose T1 to include the beginning of the
growth of infections in the United States, while still being early into the progression
14

Stock et al. (2020) also estimates the undetected rate and total infection rate in the Iceland study.

15

of covid-19 so travel is still important. Using traveler data from China, Italy, Spain,
Germany, and the UK, in Table 1, we estimate α = 0.0427 (s.e. 0.00927).15 This would
mean that for every case confirmed in the United States in early March, there are still
1−α
α

= 22 unconfirmed cases (assuming a reporting lag of 8 days). We also consider a

5 day lag model, the median time for symptoms to appear, but prefer 8 days, in order
capture the testing lag in addition to symptom onset (Lauer et al. (2020); Kaplan
and Thomas (2020); Li et al. (2020)). For the 5 day lag, T1 was set to March 10 for
comparison. We consider other T0 and T1 dates for robustness later.
How does this estimate compare to other estimates in the literature? A very recent
study by Bendavid et al. (2020) tests for COVID-19 antibodies in a representative sample of Santa Clara county residents and reports that 48,000-81,000 people are infected
as of April 1, whereas only 956 are reported that day. This leads to their reported ratio
of 50-85 of total infections to reported infections. Importantly, this calculation does
not account for the lag in reporting infections. While we do not have travel data for
Santa Clara county, we can compute a similar statistic for San Francisco County: Our
estimate of the true infected on March 13, divided by the reported infected on that
day. This yields a ratio of 85, which is at the upper bound of the 50-85 range reported
by Bendavid et al. (2020). We report these ratios for the counties in our data set in
Table 2.
We note that there is one city present in our data that is a huge outlier. Seattle
featured very early infections, and was unable to contain the spread of early infections
unlike other cities in the United States. We believe that for King County, T0 may be
much earlier than for the other cities. This means that within our time interval, there
are substantial amounts of infections caused by residents of the city, not only visitors.
As a result, this city has a substantially higher (3700%) amount of confirmed cases per
visitor than any other city at the current time, and we exclude it.
Our approach is also sensitive to the travel data magnitudes, which may not be
well estimated for the United States due to data limitations. In particular, connecting
flights after port of entry may lead to underestimates of international arrivals into
smaller cities and counties. We also lack inter-state travel between the United States,
which would be important for estimating α later into the spread of the virus.
Have we considered all epicenters of the virus for the United States and Iceland?
There were other countries which had seen substantial infections such as South Korea.
Their exclusion biases both the estimates from both Iceland as well as the United
States, and as long as the magnitudes of travel were even between the two will not
bias alpha. If these other epicenters had more travel to the United States relative to
15

This is a naive OLS standard error. We have not fully explored the sampling properties of this estimation
method.

16

Iceland, this would downward bias our estimates of α, and vice versa. However, we
see little change in our estimates by adding in Spain, Germany and UK. If the travel
patterns between the United States and Iceland to and from an omitted set of epicenter
countries are not very different, we do not believe their omission will substantially alter
our results.

5.3

Results: Range of Estimates and Robustness Checks

Our dates for T0 and T1 are chosen such that they capture the onset of the infection for
the United States. As table 3 shows, our α estimate is reasonably stable along choices of
T1 , and very stable among choices of T0 all throughout February. We estimate a range
of 4% − 14% reporting rates when there is a lag of 8 days and a range of 1.5% − 10%
for the average reporting rate across the US with a reporting lag of 5 days. Using
only China as the epicenter, we observe similar patterns in α. For early March we
note a relatively stable α over T1 . For very early choices for T1 , our Iceland estimates
of confirmed are very small, and this could create very noisy estimates of α (the first
case in Iceland was confirmed February 28). As we increase T1 , we see an increase in
α. This may be due to increases in the availability of test kits, which lead to higher
reporting rates. However, this result may in part be due to unobserved/unaccounted
travel, particularly within the United States, along with the fact that we do not have
data on March travel into the US. Both of these factors would lead to under-reporting
of travel for late March, and cause estimates of α to be upward biased. Moreover, as
we progress later into March, social distancing/health policy measures across Iceland
and U.S. began to be applied, leading to differential changes in the transmission rate.
Throughout the analysis above, we have excluded King County, Washington which
contains Seattle. Table S2 displays our estimates including this county, which heavily
skews the data. We believe this may be due to significant community infections occurring in the county during our time period, as the city was infected much earlier than
other cities.
Correct estimation of the reporting lag parameter is essential, as our estimates of
α are sensitive to this. We consider our estimates robustness to reporting lags in table
S3. Our estimates of α appear reasonably robust to a range of lengths of the lag, with
an increase as the lag becomes longer.
We note that large lags (k > 10) pose a problem for estimation in our model. For
estimation purposes, we maintain T1 − k to be a constant date as we consider changes
in the lag parameter. This means that for large lags, we must consider T1 dates deep
into March. However, the further we get into March, the more interstate travel and
carrying of infections between cities and states matters, which may lead to overstating

17

α.

5.4

Heterogeneity in β

The above argument is predicated on β being constant for both Iceland as well as the
United States. However, along with potential differences in normal social interaction
patterns leading to virus transmission, Icelandic and the US policies for handling the
spread of the virus may have diverged significantly. This means that our assumption
of β being the same across the US and Iceland may not hold. Evidence from Kucharski
et al. (2020) suggests that β is very sensitive to changes in policy, leading to this upward
bias in α.
In Section S.3, we attempt to relax that assumption. In our model, β cannot be
directly estimated from the growth of the infected trajectory due to the majority of
infected at the start arriving from travel. The details for our estimation procedure are
given in the appendix. A major problem with this approach is that it requires variation
in travel over time which we do not measure well. In essence, we use the evolution
of the infected in each country over time to learn about how infectious travelers are
once they have arrived. With constant daily travel, this variation is poor and makes
identification of β difficult.
As a coarse estimate, we find that the difference in β is about .06. The estimate of α
resulting from this procedure yields a value of .007, suggesting that our estimates using
the assumption of same β may be upward biased. However, we note our monthly travel
data does not allow for variation in travel over time, making it difficult to estimate β in
a robust manner, so any bias in measuring travel leads to bias in α. We thus note that
our main estimates of α may be upward biased, suggesting that there may be more
total infections than we have estimated. However, better travel data showing adequate
variation in time is required for reliable estimation of separate βs in our model.

5.5

Infection Fatality Rate

Given our estimated reporting rate over the time period of interest, we can compute
the implied infection fatality rate (IFR). Let Dt be the number of deaths observed on
day t. Let It be the number of cumulative total infections on day t. Let p be the period
from illness onset to death, i.e. the fatality lag. Let f (p) be the density of p over [0, P ]
with mean p̄.
We consider two alternative definitions of IFR:
1. Cumulative Infection Fatality Rate (cIFR): The cIFR at t is the fraction of cumulative deaths adjusted by mean death lag and cumulative total infections as

18

of t.
2. Cohort-matching infection Fatality Rate (mIFR): For each cohort of new infections at time t, the mIFR is the ratio of all deaths attributed to cohorts until t
and the size of each infected cohort until t. This method accounts for a random
fatality-lag rather than a fixed interval.
More specifically, we define

Pt+p̄
cIF Rt =

s=0 Ds

It
RP
s=0 0 Ds+p f (p)dp
Pt
s=0 Is − Is−1

(19)

Pt
mIF Rt =

(20)

We follow Linton et al. (2020) when estimating the distribution of the fatality lag
and fit a log-normal distribution. I−1 is the infected on the day before T0 , and may be
zero.
We estimate cIFR and mIFR for each U.S. county in our data set, computing death
rates at March 13. County-level results are shown in table 2; we have estimated the
cIFR and mIFR using both county-specific α estimates, and the national estimate of
4.27%. We estimate that the median cohort-matching infection fatality rate (mIFR) is
0.27% across U.S. counties, and cIFR of 0.28%.
Figure 2 shows the results for each U.S. county. Wayne MI, where Detroit is located,
has low estimated number of infections potentially due to low travel inflow and therefore
a high estimated mIFR.
How do these estimates compare to estimates of the IFR in the literature? Russell
et al. (2020) estimates a comparable definition to cIFR as 1.2% with complete testing
data on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, using a population that is weighted towards
the elderly. Since elderly have a substantially higher case-fatality rate, this suggests
the real cIFR may be lower than 1.2%.
Using their estimates of the true infection rate from their representative antibody
testing study, Bendavid et al. (2020), compute a cumulative infection fatality rate
with projected death accounting for 3 week death lag, and obtain an 0.12-0.2% infection fatality rate. Accounting for lags, our cumulative infection fatality rates for San
Francisco county are 0.17-0.20%, which lies at the upper bound of their estimates.
While our estimates of the IFR are substantially lower than reported case fatality
rates, we note that there is still substantial variation in our estimated IFRs across
counties in the early stages of the epidemic. This means that results from a single
county, regardless of the quality of the methodology, may not be indicative of the IFR
elsewhere. Along with many other factors, the variation in demographic composition,

19

and the variation in the quality and capacity of the health care sector, can lead to
drastically different infection fatality rates across the country.

Conclusion

In this paper, we lay out an analytically tractable model of early-period disease transmission across a known epicenter and target cities. Using this model, we provide
analytical arguments to demonstrate identification of reporting rates in target cities
away from the epicenter. Our preferred estimation strategy utilizes variation of travel
patterns from epicenter to destination cities and available randomized testing results
from elsewhere in the world. The empirical implementation of our model generates
a range of estimates for the percentage of infections that have been reported. Using
international travel data to the U.S. and randomized testing data from Iceland, for a
February to early March window, we estimate an average reporting rate in the U.S. of
4.3%. This estimate leads to an estimated median infection fatality rate of .27 − .31%
across U.S. counties. Our estimates suggest that a large number of infections in the
U.S. have not been reported in this early period.
We are not offering or endorsing any policy recommendations based on our estimates. Nor do we suggest that any of our analysis should be taken as a substitute
for well designed randomized/universal testing programs, which will provide the most
reliable estimates of the true infection rate in the population. However, we believe
our method can be useful towards providing estimates of unreported infections when
results of randomized testing studies are not available for a given location of interest.
Another aim in this paper has been to obtain tractable analytic results showing how
to identify the reporting rate from available data. Our model is a substantially stripped
down version of epidemiological models considered by (Li et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020;
Flaxman et al., 2020). These more complex models may allow additional sources of
variation in the data to pin down the key parameters of interest. Importantly, we do
want to emphasize that our identification and estimation results rely quite sensitively
on model assumptions and the (un)availability of high quality data on travel. We hope
future research can improve on these important limitations.

fatality rate and estimated infected. α is the estimated fraction of reported infections for each county
1−α
accounting for an 8-day lag. U
R = α gives the ratio of unreported to reported infections for that
county, again accounting for the fact that observed reported infections have an 8 day lag. U-A gives
the under-ascertainment rate on Mar 13 given by the total infected on Mar 13 (accounting for lag)
divided by the reported infected on Mar 13. mIFR matches cohorts of infected using a log-normal
fatality lag distribution to determine the death rate, and cIFR compares cumulative deaths 15 days
later. All of these calculations are based estimating the number of total infected on March 13 by
reported infected on March 21st divided by α, to account for an 8-day reporting lag. National α is
taken from Table 1 Full EU travel. County α uses each county’s individually computed α rather than
the nationally computed α. < .01% indicates positive numbers that round down to 0.00%.

(b) 5 Day Reporting Lag
This table displays α value for different dates for both T0 and T1 . We vary T0 across the month
of February, and T1 across early March. Very early March and February dates for T1 are not
available since Iceland confirmed infections only begin February 28. Travel data is assumed uniform across days throughout and is not weighted as T0 or T1 change. We include Italy, Spain,
Germany, and the United Kingdom as epicenters as well as China.

This plot shows the ratio of cohort-matched Confirmed Deaths to Estimated Cases in each County on Mar
13th, taking into account an 8 day lag in reporting. We use the full European Entry. We estimate deathlag time as a log-normal distribution with mean 14.5 and standard deviation 6.7. Estimated infected are
computed for each daily cohort using the National-α of 4.27%.

S.2

Lags

We derive our model incorporating reporting lags in the appendix and show how we
get the estimating equations in Section 3.3.
Recall that we denote true infected, true reported Infected, and true unreported
infected in time t and target city i as Ii,t , Ri,t , Ui,t respectively. Those for epicenter
c as Ic,t , Rc,t , Uc,t . Let k be the lagged report period. At time t city i denote the
lagged reported infected LRi,t = Ri,t−k . For epicenter c, the lagged reported infected
is LRc,t = Rc,t−k .
Define reporting rate at city i as α =
Rc,t−k
Ic,t−k

=

LRc,t
Ic,t−k .

Ri,t−k
Ii,t−k

=

LRi,t
Ii,t−k

and at epicenter c as αc =

This means that we are considering the reporting rate of lagged

reported cases on the lagged total infection.
We know that in the epicenter c, we have the following:

Ic,t = Ic,0 exp(β(t − T0 ))

(21)

Rc,t = αc Ic,t

(22)

Uc,t = (1 − αc )Ic,t

(23)

= (1 − αc )Ic,0 exp(β(t − T0 ))

(24)

When only travel data is available, our assumption 3.1 is

inc
Ii,t
Mi,t

=

Uc,t
Nc − R̂c,t

for any time t ∈ [T0 , T1 ], region i and epicenter c

(25)

We can then write it as

=

Nc − R̂c,t

(1 − αc )Ic,0 exp(β(t − T0 ))

Rc,t = α2c Ic,t+k

Rc,t−k = α2c Ic,t

(33)

Rc,−k = α2c Ic,0

(34)

Uc,t = Ic,t − Rc,t

(35)

= Ic,t − α2c Ic,t+k

(36)

= Ic,0 exp(β(t − T0 )) − α2c Ic,0 exp(β(t + k − T0 ))

Heterogeneous transmission rates

In this section, we show how our model can be modified to allow for different transmission rate β among target cities and epicenter. Transmission rate of virus could be
different across locations due to population density or humidity reasons (Sajadi et al.,
2020). Our identification strategy in Section 3.2 relies on the assumption that transmission rates across Iceland and US are the same. We will relax this assumption in this
section. We will be able to capture differential transmission rate through the variation
in virus evolution trends across locations, controlling for travel.
Let βc be the transmission rate in epicenter, βi rate for U.S. city i and βj rate for
Iceland city j. Define β̃i = βi − βc and β̃j = βj − βc as relative transmission rates for
U.S. and Iceland. Maintaining assumption 3.2, for any U.S. city i end period T1 we
have

We parameterize transmission rate as linear in urban population density, humidity
and an indicator for social distancing. We can then estimate the equations above
with nonlinear least squares pooling different end period T1 . We consider European
Epicenters as well as China. Because our data only contains constant travel, terms
that appear in both βi as well as βj are very difficult to estimate. In particular, the
constant term is very difficult to estimate, and not identified for very large magnitudes.
This problem occurs because with constant travel, infected arrivals vary over time only
with Rc,t , which causes very minor changes in arrivals. This makes time-variation of
the same cities provide little identification in β.
To circumvent these issues, we attempted to estimate βj separately using differences in infected in Iceland over time, however since travel is still constant for Iceland,
the same identification problems were present. We estimate a difference in β of .06,
indicating that in 10 days infections i n the United States will double one more time
than in Iceland. However, we note that our α estimate is biased downwards because of
travel data, and this leads to an upward bias on beta. We consider this to be an upper
bound on the difference in β between the two countries. With further investigation and
better travel data, we believe that this framework can be used to identify the spread
of infection with different infection rates.
This strategy is better than naively studying growth rates of infected between
countries because it accounts for the origin of the infection: travelers from infected
epicenters. While the infection is spreading within the country, it is not isolated, and
there are continual arrivals from the epicenter that are also spreading the infection,
failing to take into account these arrivals will lead to estimates of the spread of infection
being too high in the early stages of the progression of the virus16 .

We still maintain the assumption of constant susceptible population throughout March. Growth rate of
susceptible population depends on the ratio of infected over total population. Since the number of infected as
a fraction of total population is still small in March, we deem constant susceptible population as a reasonable
assumption.
