    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a modified understand better the 1994 Mexican peso crisis as well as aspects of the European currency crises in 1992-93.  We introduce the assumption that the speculative attack is sterilized by the domestic monetary authority, we incorporate a stochastic risk premium, and we allow for some price stickiness.  The modified model shows that macroeconomic policies inconsistent in the longer run with a fixed exchange rate can push the economy inevitably towards a currency crisis, but it also demonstrates how a government currently following consistent macroeconomic policies can suddenly face a speculative attack triggered by a large shift in speculative opinion.  However, the ability of a sudden shift in speculative opinion to trigger an attack is bounded by the position of fundamentals.  Thus an attack does not require a later change in policies to make it profitable.\n\n",
