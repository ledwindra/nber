Does Reading During the Summer Build Reading Skills? Evidence from a Randomized Experiment

ABSTRACT
There are large gaps in reading skills by family income among school-aged children in the United
States. Correlational evidence suggests that reading skills are strongly related to the amount of reading
students do outside of school. Experimental evidence testing whether this relationship is causal is lacking.
We report the results from a randomized evaluation of a summer reading program called Project READS,
which induces students to read more during the summer by mailing ten books to them, one per week.
Simple intent-to-treat estimates show that the program increased reading during the summer, and show
significant effects on reading comprehension test scores in the fall for third grade girls but not for third
grade boys or second graders of either gender. Analyses that take advantage of within-classroom random
assignment and cross-classroom variation in treatment effects show evidence that reading more books
generates increases in reading comprehension skills, particularly when students read carefully enough
to be able to answer basic questions about the books they read, and particularly for girls.

1. Introduction
According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), there are large
gaps in reading performance by family income among school-aged children in the United States.
In 2013, the gap in average NAEP reading scores between 4th-grade students who were and were
not eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was about 0.8 of a standard deviation.1 This gap has
not narrowed significantly in the last decade, and income gaps in reading skills measured from
other sources have grown substantially over the last half-century (Reardon, 2011).
Research suggests that the gap in reading skills by family income exists even before
school entry, and appears to grow during the summer. Using data from the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of over
20,000 children entering kindergarten in 1998, Downey et al. (2004) found that gaps associated
with socioeconomic status (a composite index of family income, parental education and parental
occupational status) exist at kindergarten entry, and grow more quickly during the summer
months than while school is in session. In addition, girls enjoyed a significant advantage in
reading at school entry and also enjoyed larger gains during Kindergarten compared to boys.
Some have hypothesized that socioeconomic reading skills gaps grow more during the
summer because family investments and resources matter more for skill development when
school is not in session than when it is (Alexander, Entwisle and Olson, 2001). If school is a
substitute for parental investments and low-income families invest less time and other resources
in their children’s development (Guryan et al., 2008), one might expect that children from these
families would fall behind their higher-income peers during the summer. This would be
particularly true for reading as compared with math if, as many experts believe, reading skill

development is more dependent on activities outside of school, such as exposure to language
(Hart and Risley, 1995) and time spent reading at home (Heyns, 1978; Fryer and Levitt, 2006),
and if parents tend to view literacy development as the joint responsibility of parents and
schools, but view math skill development as the responsibility primarily of schools (Evans et al.,
2004).
Research suggests that a strong correlate of reading skills is the time a child spends
reading outside of school. Heyns (1978) found that for a sample of 6th and 7th grade students, the
number of books read outside of school and the number of hours they spent per day reading were
the best predictors of reading scores. Strikingly, book reading explained a larger portion of the
variance in reading skills than socioeconomic status. Hofferth and Sandberg (2001) evaluated
time-use data for school-aged children and found that the activity that most strongly predicted
achievement on the Woodcock-Johnson Achievement Test was time spent reading. Fryer and
Levitt (2006) found that a one standard deviation increase in the number of children’s books in
the home was associated with a 0.115 standard deviation increase in reading scores, controlling
for socioeconomic status and other background characteristics.2
As is surely clear, the strength and volume of the correlational research does not fully
answer the causal question: Does additional time spent reading outside of school cause reading

In a meta-analysis of 99 studies, Mol and Bus (2011) found positive associations between print
exposure measures and verbal ability across the life span. To conduct the analysis, they found
studies that measured reading volume with print exposure tasks, which are viewed as more
objective and valid proxy measures of reading volume than self-reported surveys. Measures
such as the Title Recognition Test typically include a list of titles of best-selling authors and foils
(false or non-existing titles). In the elementary grades (1-6), Mol and Bus found stronger
correlations between print exposure measures like the TRT and reading skills for children with
lower ability levels (r = .39) than children with age-appropriate abilities (r = .20). Echols, West,
Stanovich, and Zehr (1996) found that Grade 4 TRT scores predicted reading comprehension 2
years later after controlling for baseline measures of cognitive ability. These correlations,
however, suffer from endogeniety bias since the volume of reading is not randomly assigned
across children’s environments.

skills to improve, and if so by how much? Families that have more books at home are certainly
different in unobservable ways from families that have fewer books, and children who read more
at home, whether for pleasure or because their parents strongly encourage them, are surely
different from children who do not read much outside of school. To isolate the causal effect of
out of school reading on reading skill development from the effect of other unobserved correlates
of reading, we would ideally randomly assign some children to read more than others outside of
school.
We implemented just such an experiment. We implemented a voluntary scaffolded
summer reading program called Project READS (Reading Enhances Achievement During
Summer) for 2nd and 3rd graders in 463 classrooms in 59 public schools in 7 North Carolina
school districts in the spring and summer of 2013. Students randomly selected to be in the
treatment group were given six reading comprehension lessons in the spring that focused on
reading activities designed to foster children’s engagement with books at home during the
summer. Parents were also invited to an afterschool family literacy event where they learned
about the READS activities. Treatment group students were then mailed 10 books, one per
week, during the summer. The books were matched to students based on their baseline reading
skill level and their interests. Students were encouraged to read the books, and were asked to
mail a tri-fold after they read each book; the tri-fold included three comprehension questions
about each book and a few questions designed to prompt the students to use the reading
strategies taught during the spring lessons. Students assigned to the control group received no
books during the summer, and participated in six mathematics lessons during the spring while
the treatment students participated in the reading lessons.

4
	  

The research design, which includes within classroom student- and teacher-level random
assignment, presents an opportunity to evaluate the effect of randomly induced out of school
reading on reading skill development. Both treatment and control group students were tested at
baseline in the spring, but only treatment group students were mailed 10 books during the
summer before post-testing in the fall. Because control children were given math lessons and
books were mailed to treatment group children’s homes, there was no diffusion of the treatment
components across conditions. In addition, children’s homeroom teachers, who provided
instruction during the school year, were also randomly assigned to new classrooms for the
intervention-related lessons at the end of the school. Thus, the design eliminates student and
teacher confounds and enhances the internal validity of the intention-to-treat effects.
Our findings suggest the answer to the question of whether reading more books makes
kids better readers is not a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ On average, treatment group students read more
books than control group students but ITT analyses show that the two groups had similar reading
comprehension post-test scores, suggesting that simply reading more books does not in general
cause an increase in reading comprehension skills. Breaking this result up by grade and gender,
ITT estimates show no difference in reading comprehension scores for 2nd graders, consistent
with the idea that 2nd graders do not in general have strong enough basic reading skills to benefit
from an out of school reading program. The small and insignificant test-score effects among 2nd
graders replicate previous non-significant results of READS with younger children in first- and
second-grade (Kim, 2007) and with low-income language minority children with weak basic
reading skills (Kim and Guryan, 2010). Based on the consistent finding that READS has not
shown positive test score effects for 2nd graders, we conclude that READS is not
developmentally appropriate for children of that age.

5
	  

Among 3rd graders, however, we found significant reading comprehension test score
effects for girls but not for boys, and the difference in effects by gender was statistically
significant. These ITT test score estimates suggest that on average the intervention did not cause
large increases in reading comprehension over the summer for third grade boys, but did for third
grade girls. However, the pooled ITT estimates mask interesting variation in treatment effects
across classrooms that may be informative about the underlying mechanism by which reading
might build reading skills. Focusing on the 3rd graders, where there are treatment effects to learn
from, we take advantage of the multi-site nature of the experimental design – there were
essentially 218 different experiments in the 218 different classrooms – to investigate whether
different types of reading might be differentially effective at building reading skills. Does
reading more books translate into greater reading comprehension skill gains? Does the quantity
of reading matter regardless of the child’s focus during the activity, or does reading only build
skills when it is done in an engaged and focused way?
When we compare the experimental results across classrooms, we find that in third grade
classrooms where the treatment induced students to read more books over the summer there were
larger reading comprehension gains for girls. However, this result is stronger when summer
reading is measured based on the number of tri-folds students returned indicating they had read
the book, or when a student is only credited with reading a book if he or she answered basic
questions about the book correctly, than when book reading is based on self-reports. This
suggests that either behavioral measures of book reading are more accurate, or focused engaged
reading builds transferrable reading comprehension skills while disengaged reading does not.

6
	  

We also explore whether mediators we are able to measure explain the gender difference
in treatment effects.3 We find that the difference in treatment effects by gender is not explained
by the difference in the number of books Project READS induced girls to read relative to boys.
Rather, we find that the effects of book reading were stronger for girls than for boys, which
could have several different interpretations. It may be that reading during the summer builds
reading skills for girls but not for boys. It is also possible that on average when 3rd grade girls
read during the summer, they do so in a productive way whereas 3rd grade boys tend not to. This
would be consistent with research showing that girls tend to have more positive attitudes toward
recreational reading than boys (Logan and Johnston 2009) and that parents are more likely to
read to girls than boys when they are younger (Bertrand and Pan 2013). For boys, but not for
girls, there was some weak evidence that the amount they liked the books they read during the
summer may have contributed to improved reading skills. It may be the case that when boys find
books that they like, they read in a more engaged and focused way and build reading skills as a
result. Taken together, these results suggest that, the amount of engaged, focus and careful
reading, and not simply the number of books a child reads, may be what builds reading skills
among beginning readers.

2. Project READS
Project READS (Reading Enhances Achievement During Summer) is a voluntary
scaffolded summer reading program with two primary components.4 In the spring, just prior to

The results also add to the growing literature showing larger positive effects of social policy
interventions for girls than boys (see e.g. Anderson 2008, Angrist, Lang and Oreopolous 2009,
Angrist and Lavy 2009, Dynarski 2008, Kling, Leibman and Katz, 2007)

Scaffolding is a term used in the reading and literacy literature that refers to supports given to
students as they learn to read that are meant to be substitutes for direct help from teachers,
7
	  

the end of the school year, students in the program are taught six lessons (each lasting
approximately one hour) during the school day. These lessons are focused around reading
strategies that are designed to help beginning readers to read outside of school, with limited or no
adult supports. Parents are also invited with their children to attend an afterschool family literacy
event focused on the READS comprehension activities. Then during the summer, each student is
mailed 10 books, one per week. Students are tested for reading comprehension in the spring and
fall. The spring test serves as a baseline measure of reading skills, and the fall test serves as a
post-test.
The books are chosen to match each student’s reading skill level and reading interests as
best as possible. Reading skill levels are measured using the spring baseline reading
comprehension test, which are translated into Lexiles, a proprietary system designed to align
reading skills with the difficulty of children’s books. Students are also asked questions about the
types of books they would like to read. Using an algorithm, books are then chosen that best
match each student’s interest among those that are the appropriate difficulty given the student’s
baseline reading skill level.
Previous studies of Project READS have shown evidence of its effectiveness at
improving reading comprehension and highlighted for whom and under what conditions READS
works best. Kim (2006) describes the results of a randomized controlled trial in which students
assigned to Project READS had higher reading comprehension test scores than control students,
particularly for African-American and Hispanic students. Kim and White (2008) found that
students assigned to a version of Project READS where students were prompted during the
summer to use the reading strategies taught during the spring lessons had larger test score gains

tactics that the child was taught to use when reading on his or her own.

than students who were assigned to receive books mailed to them over the summer with no
prompting to use the reading strategies. In addition, prior experimental studies of READS
experiments found no positive effects on reading comprehension for children in first- and
second-grade or for low-income Latino children. None of the prior studies of READS included
measures of book reading that were correlated with reading skills. An important contribution of
this study is the creation of a book-specific tri-fold, which was mailed with each READS book,
and which asked children comprehension questions about each of their 10 mailed books.
Children were asked to return the tri-fold when they had completed reading a READS book. The
tri-folds provide a measure of summer reading that is based on behavior rather than self-report,
and the comprehension questions on the tri-folds also provide an indication of how carefully the
student read the books.
The current study is on a much larger scale than the previous studies, and addresses the
mechanism by which reading might build reading skills. We use data from the tri-folds to shed
light on the mechanisms that may underlie improvement in reading comprehension. Finally,
whereas the previous studies took place in a single district with 400-550 students, the current
study took place in 59 North Carolina elementary schools in 7 districts and included 6,383
students (Grade 2 and 3 at baseline).

3. Estimation
We present two types of analyses. The first are standard intent to treat (ITT) estimates of
the effect of Project READS. We estimated the following model
(1)

yiFall = α 0 + α1 Ri + α y yiSpring + γ c + ε i

9
	  

Fall
where yi is a post-random assignment outcome measured in the fall, Ri is an indicator for being
Spring
randomly assigned to Project READS, yi
is a baseline reading comprehension test score, γ c is

a set of classroom fixed effects, α 0 , α1 and α y are parameters to be estimated, and ε i is a
random error term. The parameter of interest, α1 , measures the difference in average outcomes
between students randomly assigned to Project READS and students in the control group. We
refer to it as the intent to treat (ITT) estimate because Ri is the actual assignment rather than a
measure of participation. However, since all students in the study were consented prior to
random assignment, virtually every student who was randomly assigned to receive the Project
READS program did so. Thus, in practice our estimates of α1 are very close to measures of the
effect of participation, if participation is defined as receiving the spring lessons in the classroom,
an invitation to an afterschool family literacy event and being mailed 10 books over the summer.
Assignment to Project READS was selected randomly within classroom. Random
assignment ensures that in large samples Ri is uncorrelated with ε i (or equivalently with
Fall
potential outcomes for yi ), and as a result we can interpret estimates of 𝛼! as the causal effect
Fall
of assignment to Project READS on yi . Furthermore, within grade and school, classroom

teachers were randomly assigned to teach either six READS lessons or six math lessons at the
end of the school year. Students who had been randomly assigned to treatment were then
randomly assigned to one of the teachers teaching READS lessons for their end-of-year lessons,
while control students were randomly assigned to one of the teachers teaching math lessons. The
quality of classroom teachers treatment and control students were exposed to for the prior school
year is balanced mechanically because random assignment was within classroom; random
assignment of teachers for the end-of-year lessons promoted balance in the quality of teachers

10
	  

student were exposed to for those six lessons. We ran balance tests which show that teachers
assigned to teach the math and READS lessons were balanced on race, gender, and the
selectivity of the college they attended as an undergraduate; teachers assigned to teach the math
classes were older on average (2.4 years, p=0.04).
Because random assignment was conditional on classroom, we include classroom fixed
effects in all models.5 Inclusion of the baseline reading test as a control is not necessary for
internal validity, but it improves precision because it explains a large portion of the residual
variance.
The second type of model we estimate takes advantage of the fact that there were
essentially 218 different experiments, one in each third grade spring classroom. It would be
possible to estimate 218 treatment effects, each based on random assignment within a specific
classroom. Presumably, students responded to the treatment in different ways in different
classrooms. Students may have been induced to read more by Project READS in some
classrooms than others, for example. It would be interesting to know if in the classrooms where
students were induced to read more by the treatment, there were also larger treatment effects on
test scores. The logic of this analysis follows directly from Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007). We

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
5
In practice, the probability of being assigned to the treatment group was close to 0.5 in each
classroom. Since the treatment assignment probability was not correlated with classroom,
excluding the classroom fixed effects should not cause any omitted variables bias, and are
therefore not necessary. Within each classroom, randomization was also stratified by whether
students were limited English proficient (LEP) and whether they were eligible for free or reduced
lunch (FRL). Within each classroom, the probability of assignment to the treatment was the same
in the FRL/LEP and non-FRL/LEP strata, so in practice this level of stratification is ignorable.
We report results from models that include classroom fixed effects because the subsequent
analysis is at the classroom level, and models that include classroom, classroom-by-LEP/FRL
status or no fixed effects are all unbiased. The results from all three sets of models yield the same
qualitative findings.
11
	  

use classroom-by-treatment fixed effects as instruments for potential mediators of the
relationship between assignment to Project READS and test scores.
The first stage model is
(2)

M i = π c Ri + π y yiSpring + δ c + ui

where Mi is the potential mediator (e.g. number of books read during the summer), π c is a full set
of classroom-level treatment fixed effects, and ui is an error term. The second stage model is
(3) yiFall = β 0 + β1 M i + β y yiSpring + λc + ei
Classroom fixed effects are included in both the first and second stage models so that the
variation identifying the effect of the mediator on fall test scores is treatment-control
comparisons within classrooms. The identification of these mediator parameters are vulnerable to
the possibility that treatment effects on the mediators are correlated with an unobservable cause
of the test score treatment effects, what might be referred to as “omitted mediator bias.”6
However, relative to the common alternative of adding controls for potential mediators to the
ITT test score model, the assumptions of the multi-site IV method are much weaker. Whereas the
commonly used approach is invalid if the level of unobservable determinants of test scores are
correlated with treatment effects across sites, the multi-site IV only requires that the there are no
treatment-control differences in unobservables that are correlated with test score treatment
effects across sites. Since treatment is randomly assigned at each site (in our case classrooms),
baseline unobservables should be balanced across treatment and control observations within
sites. Thus, the identifying assumption is that variation in treatment effects on unobserved
mediators are not correlated with treatment effects on the included mediator.

4. Data and descriptive statistics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and baseline equivalence tests. The left panel shows
means and equivalence tests for the full study sample, while the right panel shows means for the
analysis sample, defined as observations that have non-missing baseline and post-test scores. The
majority of missing test score data is from the post-test, but the similarity of spring standardized
ITBS scores in the analysis sample and the full sample among the control group provides
comfort that restricting the analysis to observations with non-missing pre- and post-test data is
unlikely to bias the results. For observations with non-missing fall ITBS scores, we imputed
missing values for other variables using the mean value within the same classroom and
experimental group (in cases where all students in a classroom/treatment cell were missing on the
variable in question, we imputed the grade level/treatment group-specific mean). All regressions

include as controls indicators for observations with imputed values. Imputation allows us to
analyze a consistent sample across the different analyses we perform. Analyses not reported here
show qualitatively similar results when we do not impute missing values and allow the samples
to vary across analyses.

4.1. Demographics of the sample
Fifty-three percent of the students in the study were female, approximately 77 percent of
the sample were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, a common measure of poverty in
education data, and seventeen percent of students in the study were classified as limited English

13
	  

proficient. Twenty-three percent of the sample was white, 38 percent were black, 22 percent
were Hispanic and 17 percent were a race/ethnicity other than white, black or Hispanic.7

4.2. Measures of reading comprehension
A key outcome in the study was the reading comprehension section of the Iowa Test of
Basic Skills, which was administered in both the spring (baseline) and fall (post-test) specifically
for this study. ITBS scaled scores were normalized to have mean zero and standard deviation one
in each grade in the control group for the full sample. The table also reports means of three
measures of summer book reading. Students in the treatment group were mailed a tri-fold (a
piece of paper folded into thirds) with each book. The tri-folds asked the student to respond to a
series of questions aimed at reminding the students to use the reading strategies they had been
taught during the spring lessons. Students were also instructed to mail the tri-fold back,
addressed and postage paid, when they had read the book. The number of tri-folds returned is
one measure of the number of Project READS books the students read during the summer. On
average, treatment students returned slightly fewer than 4 of the 10 possible tri-folds. There were
a very small number of control students who returned tri-folds. These were students who shared
living arrangements with a treatment student, either because they were siblings or because they
lived in the same household.

4.3. Measures of summer reading
Students were also asked to report the number of books they read over the summer in a
survey administered in the fall after they returned from summer vacation.8 This question was
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
In the data students are placed into one of the following race/ethnicity categories: White, Black,
Hispanic, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian and Multi-Racial.

asked of all students, regardless of whether they were in the treatment or control group, and
asked about all books read, not just books that were mailed as a part of Project READS. Students
in the control group reported reading 9.8 books during the summer on average, while students in
the treatment group reported reading 10.9 books. The difference was statistically significant,
suggesting that assignment to participate in Project READS induced students to read an
additional 1.1 books over the summer.
On the tri-folds, students in the treatment group were asked three comprehension
questions about the book they had been mailed. The number of questions answered correctly on
returned tri-folds is a measure of book reading that requires students to have read the book
carefully enough to have been able to answer basic questions about the book. The average
treatment student answered 8 total questions correctly. Since students on average returned 3.75
tri-folds, this represents approximately 70 percent of the total possible questions on the tri-folds
students returned.

4.4. Test of baseline equivalence between treatment and control groups
Random assignment should make the treatment and control groups comparable on
average. If random assignment was carried out correctly, both unobservables and observables
should be balanced across the treatment and control groups. This is of course what allows us to
draw strong causal inferences; any average difference in post random assignment outcomes must
be driven by assignment to the treatment since other determinants of the outcome should be the

The number of books read variable is derived from the fall student survey, on which students
from both conditions were asked to respond to the question “During summer vacation, about
how many books did you read?” with answer choices “0-1,” “2-3,” up to “20 or more.” We
assigned students the mid-point value for their answer choice (e.g. students who reported having
read 2-3 books were given a value of 2.5), and students who selected “20 or more” were given a
value of 20.

same on average in the treatment and control group. It is impossible to test for baseline
equivalence of unobservables, but it is possible to test for baseline equivalence of observables.
Table 1 presents means of several variables measured at baseline, separately for the treatment
and control groups, along with p-values from t-tests of the difference in means. None of the
differences in averages at baseline is large, and the p-values of the pairwise t-tests are all larger
than 0.3. Random assignment appears to have generated balance in observables across the
treatment and control groups.

5. Intent to treat estimates
Tables 2-4 present treatment-control differences in book reading during the summer, how
much students liked the books they read over the summer, and ITBS reading comprehension test
scores in the fall after the intervention. Students were surveyed in the fall after returning from
summer vacation and asked how many books they read during the summer. Table 2 presents
estimates from a regression of self-reported summer book reading on an indicator for being
assigned to the treatment condition. Table 3 shows results from similar regressions with a
measure of how much the students reported liking the books they read during the summer, and
table 4 shows results from similar models with fall ITBS reading comprehension test scores as
the dependent variable. Each cell in the tables shows the coefficient on a treatment dummy from
a different regression. The first row shows estimates for grades 2 & 3 combined, while the next
two rows show estimates for grades 2 and 3 separately. The first column shows estimates for
boys and girls combined, while the second and third columns show estimates for boy and girls
separately. Because random assignment was conditional on spring classroom, all regressions
control for spring classroom fixed effects.

16
	  

The consent process occurred prior to random assignment, so only consented students
were eligible to be randomly assigned. All students randomly assigned to the treatment condition
participated in the spring reading lessons and were in fact mailed 10 books during the summer.
Thus, the estimates shown in tables 2-4 can be thought of as intent to treat (ITT) estimates of the
effect of being assigned to Project READS. However, since the take-up rate was 100 percent
among those assigned to treatment and there was very little control crossover, the estimates in
tables 2 and 4 are very close to estimates of the effect of participation in Project READS on
summer reading and reading comprehension.
On average, control group students reported reading 9.8 books during the summer.
Control group third graders reported reading fewer books than second graders. Third graders
reported reading 9.2 books; second graders reported reading 10.3 books.9 From that baseline,
mailing books to students during the summer caused them to increase their summer reading
activity by about 1.1 books on average. The increase was statistically significant, and treatment
effects tended to be slightly larger for boys than girls. Second and third grade boys in Project
READS read about 1.3 more books than their control group counterparts. Second and third grade
girls read approximately 0.8 more books than their control group counterparts.
The treatment effect of Project READS on book reading was slightly larger for third
graders than for second graders, though this difference was not statistically significant. The
treatment effect for second graders was an additional 1.0 books, while the treatment effect for
third graders was an additional 1.2 books. There was not a statistically significant effect of
Project READS on book reading for second grade girls (the point estimate was 0.560 books, with
a standard error of 0.380), whereas the treatment effect for second grade boys was an additional
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
Second graders and third graders typically read different types of books, so the amount of text
read by third graders was likely greater than the amount of text read by second graders.

1.4 books (standard error of 0.411). The gender difference in the treatment effect on book
reading among second graders was marginally significant. There was no corresponding gender
difference in the effect of READS on summer reading for third graders. READS increased
summer reading by 1.2 books for both boys and girls in third grade.
Project READS did not just induce children to read more books during the summer. It
also may have caused children to read different books than they otherwise would have. Books
are matched to students based both on their baseline reading skills and on their interests. Students
responded to survey questions in the spring designed to elicit their reading tastes. To match
students to books of the appropriate reading difficulty, baseline ITBS scores were translated into
Lexiles, a proprietary system in which student reading skills and books are rated on a comparable
scale. An algorithm was then used to choose 10 books for each student that most closely matched
the student’s reading interests among the books that were within the recommended range on the
Lexile scale. By mailing particular books to students, Project READS may have induced some
students to read those books instead of books they would have read in the absence of the
program. The books may be better matched based on the Lexile measure of difficulty, but they
may be matched less well in other dimensions. Table 3 shows how Project READS affected how
much students reported liking the books they read during the summer. The estimates show that
treatment students reported liking the books they read significantly less than control students.
This effect was fairly stable across grade and gender, with estimates ranging from approximately
0.15 to 0.22 standard deviation declines.
Table 4 shows the estimated ITT effects of Project READS on ITBS reading
comprehension scores. The pooled second and third grade sample showed no treatment control
difference in reading comprehension scores. The point estimate on the standardized test score

18
	  

(standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation 1 in the control group) was 0.014 with a
standard error of 0.017. The estimate for second graders was also small and statistically
insignificant. The point estimate for second graders was 0.010 with a standard error of 0.023.
The estimated effect for second grade boys was 0.027 with a standard error of 0.034, and for
second grade girls was -0.004 with a standard error of 0.034. The lack of an effect on reading
comprehension skills for second grader was perhaps not surprising since Project READS was
developed for 3rd-5th graders. As a voluntary scaffolded summer reading program, Project
READS requires students to read at home with limited or no adult support. Second graders are
perhaps not skilled enough readers yet to benefit from reading on their own. There also was not a
statistically significant effect on summer reading for second grade girls, though the confidence
interval for that estimate is too wide to rule out reasonably large increases in summer reading.
The third grade sample showed a small and insignificant reading comprehension effect
when boys and girls are pooled, but there was a notable gender difference. For the pooled sample
of boys and girls in the third grade, the treatment effect on test scores was 0.020 with a standard
error of 0.024. For third grade boys, there was a negative and insignificant reading score effect of
-0.024 (standard error of 0.036). For third grade girls, there was a positive treatment effect of
0.073 with a standard error of 0.034. The reading comprehension effect for third grade girls was
statistically significantly different from zero, and also statistically significantly different from the
third grade boy effect. The reading comprehension effect for third grade girls was fairly large in
magnitude. For that group, the treatment caused an increase in reading of about 1.2 books during
the summer and an increase of 7.3 percent of a standard deviation in reading comprehension
skills relative to the control group. One way to think about the magnitude of the effect is in
months of learning. Measured this way, the treatment effect for third grade girls is equal to the

19
	  

test score gain that the average student experiences in 1.4 months between 2nd and 4th grade.10
Put a different way, in 2013 the difference in NAEP reading scores between free lunch eligible
and free lunch ineligible students was 0.79 standard deviations; the ITT effect for third grade
girls was 9.2 percent as large as the poverty gap in reading achievement.11
Based on these results, there is not a clear answer to the question that motivated this
study: whether reading books outside of school improves reading skills. Second graders may not
have the necessary skills to benefit from the type of reading activity that Project READS
encourages, a finding that is consistent with past studies of READS (see e.g. Kim 2007). Among
third graders, boys appeared not to benefit on average from additional reading while girls
benefited significantly from a modest increase in reading activity. Why is there this gender
difference in the degree to which reading builds reading skills? Are there particular types of
reading that are more effective at building reading skills for beginning readers? Perhaps
exploring these differences can help us to understand how reading skills are developed.

6. Are there more and less effective ways to read?
To delve deeper into the mechanisms by which reading builds reading skills, we focus on
third graders where there were treatment effects on test scores to try to understand, and we take
advantage of the fact that random assignment occurred within classrooms. In a sense, this means
that there were really 218 different third grade experiments, one in each third grade classroom.
This allows us to ask whether the treatment effects on reading comprehension scores were larger
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10
Measured in scaled test score points, the treatment effect for 3rd grade girls was 1.9 points. The
average annual growth in scaled scores in the ITBS for grade 2 to 3 and grade 3 to 4 is 16.0
points, or approximately 1.33 points per month.

in the classrooms where treatment students reacted to the treatment differently. Were test score
effects larger in classrooms where students read more books? Did students build more general
reading comprehension skills in classrooms where students exhibited better comprehension of
the specific books they read?
These are essentially questions about what the mediators are for the treatment effect on
test scores. To identify the effect of potential mediators on test scores, following Kling, Liebman
and Katz (2007), we estimated a series of instrumental variables (IV) models using classroomby-treatment assignment dummies as instruments for the potential mediators. This IV model
takes advantage of the random assignment – the instruments are the randomly assigned treatment
dummy interacted with pre-random-assignment classroom – and essentially asks whether test
score effects were significantly larger in classrooms where treatment assignment caused the
potential mediator to increase more relative to the control group.
For the mediator analysis, we focus on third graders because we believe the intervention
was not properly designed for second graders and because there were no apparent test score
effects for boys or girls in second grade. As described above, Project READS has been
implemented for a number of years in multiple locations, and prior to this study it has only
shown test score effects when it focused on third through fifth graders. Originally, the current
study was intended for third and fourth graders who were to receive the intervention for two
consecutive summers (grade three to grade four, and then grade four to grade five), consistent
with the sampling design of grade three through five students in earlier studies (Kim and White,
2008). Fourth graders were replaced with second graders just prior to implementation because of
a change in testing that would have made it impossible to obtain posttest data for fourth graders
in this cohort.

21
	  

6.1. Does reading more books during the summer improve reading comprehension skills?
Table 5 presents the estimates of mediator effects from these IV models. Each row of the
table shows results for a different potential mediator. While it is clearly not possible to test for
every potential mediator, we focused on measures of summer reading activity, the potential
mediator around which READS was designed. We present estimates for several mediators, each
of which measures summer reading behavior in a slightly different way. For each mediator, we
show results for the pooled sample of boy and girl third graders in the first column, followed by
estimates for third grade boys and third grade boys. The first two rows show estimates in which
self-reported summer book reading is the potential mediator. Students were surveyed in the fall
after returning from summer vacation and asked how many books they read over the summer. A
positive effect would indicate that classrooms where mailing books caused a larger increase in
summer book reading also had larger treatment effects on reading comprehension skills. The first
row presents results from a specification in which the self-reported number of books is the
potential mediator; the second row shows results for a median split of self-reported book reading,
or a binary indicator for having read more than 8.5 books. In both summer-book-reading
specifications, the point estimates are positive but not significantly different from zero. The point
estimates are moderate in magnitude. The estimate for the pooled third grade sample is 0.007,
which would mean that in a classroom where mailing 10 books home caused an increase in
reading of 5 books relative to the control group, the treatment effect would have been 3.5 percent
of a standard deviation. Given the size of the standard errors, based on the estimates in rows 1
and 2 of table 5, we cannot rule out fairly large effects or no effect at all of inducing students to
read during the summer.

22
	  

Self-reported reading measures may not accurately measure actual reading activities. One
nice feature of the research design is that we have alternative measures of reading behavior.
Every student in the treatment group was asked to return a tri-fold every time they read one of
the books they had received in the mail. While this not a direct measure of reading, it has the
feature that it is based on behavior (the student has to mail the tri-fold) rather than a report of
behavior. Rows 3 and 4 show the results where the number of tri-folds returned is treated as the
potential mediator. A linear count of tri-fold returns is used in row 3, and median split indicator
for having returned more than 2 tri-folds is used in row 4. Virtually all control students returned
zero tri-folds, so the first stage estimates are essentially the average number of tri-folds returned
by the treatment students in the classroom.12 The analysis therefore asks whether treatment
effects on test scores were higher in classrooms where the treatment students read more of the
books they were mailed during the summer.
The results suggest that returning more tri-folds, and presumably reading more of the
Project READS books, was associated with a larger test score effect for girls and not for boys.
The point estimates for boys were small and insignificant, while the point estimates for girls
were reasonably large and statistically significant. In the specification with the linear measure of
tri-fold returns, the point estimate for girls was 0.014, which indicates that in a classroom where
the students read all 10 books that were mailed home, the girls in the program scored 0.14
standard deviations higher than the control group on the reading comprehension post-test. In
other words, reading the Project READS books improved reading comprehension skills for girls
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
There were a very small number of control students who lived in the same household as
treatment students and who returned tri-folds that were mailed to the treatment student with
whom they were living. This control group crossover would presumably tend to reduce any
measured treatment effects since some control students received the treatment. Since this
represents a very small portion of the sample, we suspect any understatement of treatment effects
is small.
12

23
	  

in classrooms where the students participated in the program as intended. It is possible that there
is something else about the classrooms where the treatment students read a lot of the mailed
books that explains the high treatment effects on test scores. However, it is interesting that the
treatment effects are not large for boys in those classrooms. This gender pattern suggests there
may be something about the ways that boys and girls read that makes summer reading more
effective at building reading skills for girls than boys. It is possible, for example, that on average
third grade girls are more diligent and engaged than boys when they read in unsupervised
settings.

6.2. Does reading carefully over the summer improve reading comprehension skills?
Does the extent to which students are engaged when they read matter for how effectively
reading builds reading skills? Do students who are focused enough when they read books over
the summer that they can answer questions on basic facts about the book gain more general
reading comprehension skills than students who did not retain an understanding of the specific
books they read over the summer? We address these questions with the analyses presented in the
fifth row of table 5. On each tri-fold, students were asked to answer reading comprehension
questions about the book they had been mailed. In the IV models shown in row 5, the potential
mediator is the total number of items the student answered correctly on those tri-fold reading
comprehension questions. The analysis asks whether in classrooms where the students read
carefully enough to be able to correctly answer basic reading comprehension questions about the
books they read during the summer, the treatment effect on general reading comprehension skills
was larger. In other words, does reading carefully enough to understand a particular book
generate reading comprehension skills that carry over to reading other materials?

24
	  

The estimates are shown in row 5 of table 5. For boys, the point estimate was zero, while
for girls there was a marginally significant positive effect of 0.006 with a standard error of 0.003
(p=0.052). The estimate suggests that in classrooms where students were focused and engaged
enough when they read over the summer that they were able to answer comprehension questions
about the books, girls gained reading comprehension skills that carried over to other reading
activities. This suggests that encouraging children to read during the summer may not be enough;
it may be important for them to read in an active and engaged way to build reading skills.

6.3. Does liking the books you read matter for building reading skills?
Why does reading in this way not appear to improve reading skills for boys in the way it
does for girls? One clue might be found in the results shown in row 6 of table 4. In those models,
the potential mediator is the degree to which students reported liking the books they read over
the summer.13 For the pooled sample of boys and girls, the estimate of the effect of reading
books students like was not statistically distinguishable from zero. The estimate for girls was
close to zero and insignificant as well. For boys, the point estimate was positive but not
statistically different from zero. Though it was not significant, the point estimate for boys was
reasonably large in magnitude, and the contrast with the estimate for girls is interesting. Care
should be taken when interpreting coefficients that are not statistically significant, but the results
are weakly suggestive that liking the books they read may be important for boys to build reading
skills. Again, we emphasize that this estimate is not statistically significant; this result may be
worthy of further inquiry.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
The survey question was, “Overall, how much did you like or dislike the books you read this
summer?” The choices were: “I loved them,” “I liked them,” “They were okay,” and “I didn’t
like them.” Scores of 4-1 were assigned to these answers, and that variable was normalized to
have mean zero and standard deviation one.

7. Conclusion
Gaps in reading skills by family income are present early in childhood and appear to
grow over the summer when children are not in school. Numerous studies document a strong
correlation between reading skills and the amount of reading students do outside of school. It is
possible that differences in out of school reading explain the income-based gaps in reading skills,
and that policies aimed at increasing the amount of reading that children do outside of school
could improve reading skills generally and narrow gaps. On its own, however, the correlational
evidence does not establish a causal relationship, and may not be informative about policy.
In this paper, we report the results from a randomized evaluation of a summer reading
program called Project READS, which induces students to read more during the summer by
mailing ten books to them, one per week. Comparisons of students randomly assigned to Project
READS with control students showed that the program increased reading during the summer by
slightly more than one book, relative to baseline reading levels of approximately 10 books.
Similar comparisons showed significant effects on reading comprehension test scores in the fall
for third grade girls, but not for third grade boys or second graders of either gender. The effects
on reading comprehension achievement test scores for third grade girls were large in magnitude
relative to the intensiveness of the intervention; assuming the standard deviation of ITBS scores
in our control group is comparable to the standard deviation of NAEP reading scores, the
treatment effect of 0.073 standard deviations is approximately 9.2 percent of the free-lunch
eligible/ineligible gap in NAEP reading scores, and is equal to the gain in test scores a typical
third grader experiences in 1.4 months.

26
	  

We also used the multi-site nature of the experiment – randomization took place in 218
separate classrooms – to explore the causal relationship between reading and the development of
reading skills. Analyses that used classroom-by-treatment status indicators as instruments for the
amount and kind of reading students did showed that reading more books generated increases in
reading comprehension skills, particularly when students read carefully enough to be able to
answer basic questions about the books they read, and particularly for girls. We find that for third
grade girls reading an additional book during the summer increases reading comprehension by 1
to 1.4 percent of a standard deviation, depending on our measure of book reading. To put these
estimates into context, this would imply that reading an additional five books over the summer
would generate reading score gains equal to 6 to 9 percent of the poverty gap in reading
achievement scores in the NAEP.
Another way to measure the magnitude of the treatment effects is relative to costs.
Compared with many interventions in education, READS is moderate in per-student costs. We
estimate that that cost to provide the Project READS intervention described in this study was
between $250 and $400 per student. These costs include the cost of the books, the mailings,
stipends to teachers, salaries of staff who managed the implementation, and testing. Relative to
costs of this magnitude, the treatment effect for third grade girls of 0.073 SD compares favorably
with effect sizes from the Tennessee STAR class size experiment (Krueger 1999, Schanzenbach
2006) and Perry Preschool (Schweinhart et al. 2005). For the third grade girls subgroup, the test
score effect per $1,000 of per-student cost ranges from 0.18 to 0.29. For comparison, the test
score effect per $1,000 of per-student cost was approximately 0.01 for class size reduction in the
Tennessee STAR study, and approximately 0.03 for Perry Preschool.

27
	  

Of course, cost benefit ratios for the treatment effects for other subgroups that we
estimate to be statistically insignificant and close to zero clearly cannot be distinguished from
zero. The size of our study does not allow for sufficiently powerful tests of the hypothesis that
the benefit-cost ratio is greater than 1 for other subgroups, or for the full sample of third graders,
based on the intent to treat analyses.
The instrumental variables estimates provide an alternative way to estimate cost-benefit
ratios for the average student in the study. On average, third grade students randomly assigned to
Project READS read 1.3 more books over the summer than control students. Using the perstudent costs described above, the intervention increased book reading by 3.1 to 5.0 books per
$1,000 spent. As just mentioned, the instrumental variables estimates in table 5 imply that
reading an additional book during the summer generates an increase in reading scores between
0.010 and 0.014 standard deviations. This would imply a benefit-cost ratio of approximately 0.03
to 0.07 for the average third grader in the study, which is substantially smaller than the benefitcost ratios we estimate for the third grade girl subgroup, but which compares favorably with
class-size reduction and Perry Preschool.
Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the answer to the question posed by
the title is not a simple “yes” or “no.” Going through the motions of reading without being
focused enough to remember basic facts about the book may not be effective at building lasting
reading skills. Reading carefully and with enough focus to be able to answer reading
comprehension questions about the book appears to build reading skills that improve
comprehension of other texts weeks or months later. How best to get children learning to read in
an engaged and focused way remains an open question, and would be a promising area for future
research.

Note. The analysis sample is based on students with non-missing data for pre- and posttest. Pvalues for mean T/C differences are derived from regressions of variable on indicator for treatment
assignment and fixed effects for homeroom. Comp Std. Score is students’ standard score on the
ITBS reading comprehension subtest. FRL=student is eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.
LEP=student is classified as limited English proficiency. “# Books Read” is based on students
self-report on fall survey (see footnote 8). “Enjoyment of Books (std.)” is students’ answers to the
fall survey question, “Overall, how much did you like or dislike the books you read this summer?”
The choices were: “I loved them,” “I liked them,” “They were okay,” and “I didn’t like them.”
Scores of 4-1 were assigned to these answers, and that variable was normalized to have mean zero
and standard deviation one. Missing values for demographic variables, “# Books Read,” and
“Enjoyment of Books (std)” are imputed with homeroom and treatment group-specific sample
means, or grade-level and treatment-group specific means when all students in homeroom are
missing on the variable (“# Books Read,” and “Enjoyment of Books (std)” only).
