The Link Between Fundamentals and Proximate Factors in Development
Wolfgang Keller and Carol H. Shiue
NBER Working Paper No. 18808
February 2013, Revised February 2014
JEL No. F1,O1
ABSTRACT
The paper introduces a framework for studying the hierarchy of growth factors, from deep to more
immediate. The specific setting we examine is 18th and 19th century Germany, when institutional
changes introduced by reforms and transportation improvements converged to create city growth. We
assess the impact of institutions on growth by allowing two ways for institutions to affect growth.
Institutions can directly affect growth, or it can impact on trade, which in turn affects growth. Once
we separately quantify the link from institutions to trade, and trade to growth, the independent effect
of institutions on growth is small. This suggests that part of what is often understood as trade’s effect
on growth can be attributed to institutional change. It is straightforward to apply this framework to
other settings.

Introduction

Recent research on growth has begun to examine the deeper, fundamental causes of growth.
This has proved very productive because relative to proximate factors, the greater distance
between fundamental factors and economic growth allows for a more powerful causal analysis.
At the same time, the relationship between the more proximate causes of growth and the deeper
causes remains a bit of a puzzle. Do fundamental changes such as institutional reform a¤ect
the incentives to accumulate capital, to engage in trade, to adopt new technologies, or all of
these things? To date we know little on how fundamentals exert their e¤ect on the causes, or
other manifestations, of growth.
As a result of the French Revolution, institutional changes were imposed upon certain areas in Europe and in particular, a number of German areas experienced drastic improvements
in their economic institutions. Later, in the 19th century, parts of Germany saw major improvements in interregional connections due to steam railways. A priori, deeper institutional
changes and transportation improvements could have had independent e¤ects on city growth.
Alternatively, these e¤ects could be interdependent, in which case it would be important to be
able to separately quantify the channels through which institutions impact on city growth.
We begin by showing that both institutions, as well as railways, a¤ect the proximate factor
that we focus on in this paper, namely, trade: T rade = T rade(Inst; Rail). Our measure of
trade is based on spatial price gaps. Since many factors have transactions cost aspects to
them, price gaps reect the strength of integration between markets. We then link institutions
via trade to growth: Growth =

1 T rade(Inst; Rail)

+ u. Central to the paper is that we

separate the growth impact of institutions through trade from non-trade channels by including
an independent institutions e¤ect: Growth =
identi cation of

1

and

2

1 T rade(Inst; Rail) +

2 Inst + u.

The separate

is possible because trade is not only a¤ected by institutions but

also by other transactions-cost reducing developments of the 19th century, in particular steam
railways. A key nding of the paper is that institutions a¤ect growth to a substantial degree
through trade in this period.
Recent work has shown that institutions have a strong e¤ect on growth (Helpman 2004,
Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005a, La Porta et al. 2008 provide reviews). We also
1

know that institutions a¤ect trade (Greif 1993, Nunn 2007; review by Nunn and Treer 2013).
In addition, a few papers have established a signi cant relationship between trade and growth
(Frankel and Romer 1999), in particular by showing that comparative advantage and the degree
of competition a¤ect growth (Young 1991, and Bloom, Draca, van Reenen 2011 respectively).
This paper provides a unifying framework by linking institutions, trade, and growth. Our
result says that in the set X of Inst => X => Growth, trade is important. Arguably, this
goes beyond a simple change of labels. Both to understand growth and to assess the early
e¤ectiveness of policy, it is necessary to know the chain of events that institutional change sets
in motion.
To the extent that trade gives rise to gains in welfare and income, one can view trade as
operating at a level similar to other proximate factors, such as physical or human capital.1 A
counter-perspective might be that trade is not so much a proximate cause of growth as an aspect
of institutions. In fact, much of the initial work on institutions was interested in capturing the
impact of a broad cluster of institutions (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001), whereas
later work aimed at pinpointing a crucial subset of institutions (Djankov et al. 2003, Acemoglu
and Johnson 2005). If one thinks of trade as an aspect of institutions, then this paper can be
viewed as a contribution to the literature on unbundling institutions.
As the placement of railways may have occurred non-randomly, we employ a measure of
railway costs, which varies with geographic features at the sub-state level, as an instrumental
variable.2 Of course, geography can have direct e¤ects on trade and on growth (Krugman and
Venables 1995), in which case it would not be a valid instrumental variable. Our relatively
disaggregated data allows for richer identi cation strategies than can be applied with countrylevel data (Nunn 2009).3 In addition, we can employ placebo checks since steam locomotives
were not available in Germany for part of the sample period. The strategy will be successful
if conditional on covariates railway costs a¤ected railway building during the later part of the
1

While trade is less commonly seen as a proximate factor compared to factor accumulation, others before us
have considered trade as a proximate factor (Rodrik, Subramaniam, and Trebbi 2004, 132).
2
Duo and Pande (2007) and Nunn and Puga (2012) also employ terrain in their studies.
3
Moreover, city size, our outcome variable, exhibits the same broad patterns as per capita GDP at the
country level (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005b), so the issue of whether sub-national results apply at
the macro level is not a concern.

19th century. If, however, there is something correlated with railway costs that also switches
on in the late 19th century, then identi cation fails. We perform a number of di¤erent analyses
to defend the approach.
Similarly, the challenge in estimating the impact of institutions on growth is that both may
be driven by a third factor, or there is reverse causation. It is indeed rare that one can treat
institutions as exogenous. The shock of French rule to German institutions around 1800 was
unusual in that it was plausibly exogenous, and similar to Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and
Robinson (2011; ACJR for short) we use it as our second instrumental variable. The Germans
did not choose French institutions; rather, those institutions were imposed upon them. We rst
use French rule and railway costs as instrumental variables to establish that institutions and
railways impact trade. In the next step we use French rule and railway costs as instrumental
variables for showing that institutions a¤ect growth primarily through trade. Sections 4 and 5
give a more detailed exposition that provide support for this strategy.
We are not the rst to distinguish fundamentals from proximate growth factors, and neither
are we the rst to examine the hierarchy of growth causes.4 There is evidence, for example,
that Protestantism in 19th century Prussia raised income mostly because it led to human
capital accumulation (Becker and Woessmann 2009). Also, Dell (2012) proposes ine¢cient land
reform as the mechanism why conict in early 20th century Mexico had negative economic
consequences. Identi cation is a central challenge in any study of the hierarchy of growth
factors. Nineteenth century Germany provides a setting in which a causal growth analysis of
fundamentals and proximate factors can be pursued.
The nding of a signi cant role for railways in 19th century Germany ts well with recent
studies on the impact of infrastructure projects (Michaels 2008, Duranton and Turner 2012),
especially railways in history (Donaldson 2012, Donaldson and Hornbeck 2012, Hornung 2012).
The main di¤erence between our analysis and other infrastructure papers is that we include the
institutional conditions that were behind railway building as the central element of the analysis.
We do this by applying the well-known two-sample instrumental variables approach developed
4

An inuential example is Rodrik, Subramaniam, and Trebbi (2004). Often the so-called mechanisms question concerns also the hierarchy of growth causes. In an earlier paper, we have studied a hierarchy of market
size e¤ects (Keller and Shiue 2008).

by Angrist and Krueger (1992). It allows us to employ rich bilateral data on prices and railway
lines by combining this information at the city-pair level with information on population size
and institutions at the city-level.
It is likely that during this period, there were not only other fundamentals apart from the one
we investigateincluding geography (Diamond 1997, Sachs 2001), cultural environment (Clark
1987), or religion (Weber 1930)but other proximate factors as well besides trade. Although we
do consider a broad range of alternative explanations in order to ensure that our fundamental
and proximate factors are both important to growth, our motive in this paper is not to rank the
relative importance of one fundamental versus another, or one proximate factor versus another.
Rather, the contribution is to formulate and test a set of empirical implications on the role of
institutions for economic performance.
The paper is structured as follows. The following section gives the background necessary for
interpreting the results. Section 3 introduces the sample and discusses the main variables, with
additional information given in Appendix A. In section 4 we estimate the impact of institutions
and railways on price gaps. Section 5 turns to the impact of institutions on growth, showing
that trade can be separated from other channels through which institutions may work. This
section also introduces the two-sample approach of mapping city-pair to city observations,
and concludes with a discussion of the main ndings. More information on our two-sample
instrumental variables approach is found in Appendix B. A number of nal issues are raised in
section 6.

Historical Background: German Cities in the 19th Century

Over much of the 19th century, a central feature of the region known as Germany today was
that despite centuries of shared language and culture, there were numerous independent states
that chose their own policies and institutions. The 1848 borders of these states are shown
in Figure 1. Politically, the German states had shifting alliances, at times ghting wars on
opposing sides. Economically, their institutions and policies di¤ered. Larger states such as
4

Prussia or Bavaria were geographically disjoint and cities in di¤erent parts of the same state
were subject to di¤erent policies. This motivates why our analysis is at the sub-state level of
the city, rather than at the state level. The location of the sample cities is shown in Figure 2,
and their characteristics are discussed in section 3.2 below.
This era a¤ords us with a mixture of common and idiosyncratic shocks that a¤ected German
economic development during the 19th century. Two of these stand out and are at the center of
our analysis. First, there was change in the economic institutions governing these areas which
was parallel to broader waves of political changes. The French Revolution in 1789 was the major
source of new ideas that swept throughout Europe. In Germany it led to deep institutional
change that varied across regions according to how strongly a particular region was a¤ected by
French rule. Although to some extent reversed during a period of restoration after 1815, the
French Revolution had a profound impact on German regional development throughout the
19th century, which may have only been superseded by the political uni cation of Germany in
the year 1871. Our sample period ends soon after (in 1880), and it begins in the year 1820
after the disruptive consequences of the Napoleonic armies had faded away.
Second, Germany experienced a transport revolution during the 19th century in the form
of the rapid building of steam railways. The introduction of railways was accompanied by
widespread economic change in many countries (Fogel 1964, Donaldson 2012), and in Germany
it has been argued that the associated reduction in the costs of trade a¤ected not only the
patterns of specialization but also the pace of structural change (Fremdling 1975, Gutlerbet
2012). Unlike in the politically uni ed France, railway building in Germany was a highly
decentralized decision, where local governments and business groups mattered (see the histories
of individual railway lines in Fremdling, Federspiel, and Kunz 1995).
These two features taken together make for a unique, almost laboratory-style setting in
which to study the relationship between institutional change, trade, and growth. The next
section provides additional information on railways in Germany, followed by a synopsis of
institutional changes as a consequence of French rule.

2.1

Steam Railways in 19th Century Germany

The invention of steam locomotives in England in the early 1800s fueled widespread railway
line construction, and it was arguably the most important of a series of transport innovations
(paved roads, improvements in waterways) that accompanied 19th century economic growth.
The rst German railway track was a 4-mile line from Nurnberg to Fürth opened in December
1835. The rst longer track was opened between Dresden and Leipzig in the year 1841 (70
miles). Thereafter, additional miles of rail were laid down swiftly, and between 1840 and 1877
the length of German railway lines grew 60-fold. The pace of railway line building in Germany
during this time was faster than either in England or in France (Putzger 2003). Figure 3 shows
the German railway system by 1880, the last year of our sample.
How did this system emerge? One person who saw the potential of steam railways early on
was the German-born economist Friedrich List, who proposed a national plan for Germanys
railway system in the year 1833; it is shown in Figure 4. Lists plan was in fact never implemented. What List had planned was to connect the larger German points of trade with each
other. The reality, however, was quite di¤erent (see Fremdling, Federspiel, and Kunz 1995). In
the year 1850, for example, the major Southern cities of München (Bavaria), Stuttgart (Wurttemberg), and Karlsruhe (Baden) were still not connected (see Figure 5). Also, the train line
from the Holstein city of Kiel heading south ended for a long time in the city of Altona (also
Holstein), just short of the major port of Hamburg. The reason for these omissions was that
the development of train lines often focused on the states own territories, without much consideration given to national railway interests. Therefore it is unlikely that the train system as
it actually evolved was optimal in the sense of maximizing German economic welfare.
The immediate impact of steam trains was that transport costs between two cities were
reduced (Fremdling 1995). In 19th century Germany, average freight rates on roads are estimated at around 40 Pfennige per tonkilometer. Early railways cut these rates to about 11, and
rail improvements brought this down to less than 4 Pfennige by the end of the sample (Gutlerbet 2012, Table 2). We study the impact of railways by comparing the speed with which
prices converged between cities served by railways versus between cities not served by railways.
Generally, railways were important for the transport of many low value-to-weight ratio goods,
6

including grain (OBrien 1983, 1-2). While we do not have comprehensive information on wheat
traded via railroads, the great majority of all Bavarian grain exports to the south in the early
1850s was transported on railways (Seu¤ert 1857, Chapters 5, 6). Even though there is evidence that railways mattered, the importance of railways for transporting grain varied greatly
because transporting grain by ship was cheaper yet. In the late 19th century, for example,
sending grain from Posen (in East Prussia) to Cologne by railway was at least three times as
expensive as transporting it by ship via Rotterdam and the Rhine River (Köttgen 1890, 64).
Some evidence on price gaps before and after the introduction of railways is shown in Figure
6. The average wheat price gap in the years before steam rail transport is around 0.15, and
it falls to about half that after a railway line is opened. While the placement of steam trains
is taken as exogenously given and alternative explanations are not accounted for, this gure
is consistent with railways bringing down price gaps. There is also evidence for heterogeneous
e¤ects, with a decline of 0.20 for initially high price gaps (at the 95th percentile).

2.2

French Rule and Institutional Change

The main driver of institutional change in Germany during this time was arguably the inuence
from France.5 The ideas of the French Revolution of 1789, including separation of powers,
democracy, and human rights, found many followers in German areas, even though after the
defeat of Napoleon in 1815 conservative forces were able to regain their hold on political power.
Revolutionary ideas from France swept through the German lands again in the year 1830 and
more signi cantly in 1848.
Not all the new political ideas were implemented, but the ones that were had a strong impact
on economic institutions. When political rights imply economic rights, this follows naturally.
For example, a constitution stating that everybody, including the king, is equal before the law
also stipulates that there is equality before the law for disputes in commercial transactions.
Other changes in economic institutions were related to the idea of freedom. For example, many
German cities saw the abolishment of the requirement that skilled workers had to be members
of the local crafts guild.
5

This section draws on Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and Robinson (2011; ACJR).

7

There were a number of ways through which economic institutions were changed. First,
the institutional changes were implemented as the direct consequence of French rule during the
time of the French Revolutionary Wars. Between 1792 and 1795, for example, the seigneurial
regime and the guilds were abolished in the Rhineland. The institutional changes did not end
with the rise of Napoleon to power, however, because he continued to implement the reforms
initiated before.
Second, even after Napoleons defeat several German areas either kept or put in place
French-inspired institutional reforms. This may be interpreted as a recognition of the need to
modernize on the part of German elites. Given Frances military victories, it was apparent
that German military, administration, and ultimately her economy was inferior to the French.
While some of the institutional change in the German cities was defensive in nature, ACJR
show that the decisive push was externally triggered by French rule during Revolutionary and
Napoleonic times.
Turning to some preliminary evidence on the relationship between institutional change and
city population growth, Figure 7 contrasts population size for the group of cities that implemented institutional change relatively early with the group of cities that did so relatively late.
We see that cities implementing institutional change early were larger in the 1820s. The typical
city in either subsample grew by about one percent per year through the 1840s, before the size
of cities among the early adopters starts to grow much more rapidly. This gure is consistent
with a positive impact of institutional change on city growth. At the same time, this interpretation of Figure 7 takes the timing of institutional change as exogenously given, an assumption
that we evaluate in section 5.

Data

The paper focuses on forty German cities during the period 1820 to 1880. The sample period
starts in 1820 because the rst years of the 19th century were tumultuous years of war and
changing alliances that di¤er greatly from the following years.
The list of the forty cities is given in Table 1A. Economic growth is measured in terms of
the cities change in population size, a standard way of studying growth at the city level. Our
8

sample is largely determined by the availability of wheat price data, as well as by the available
information on the individual sample cities (statistical coverage was only fully harmonized after
the German Reich had been founded in 1871). We use data every ve years to reduce the e¤ect
of serial correlation in annual data. Although the sample is moderate in size, it covers the
major German areas, and it has broad geographic coverage (see Figure 2), which is important
for any analysis of trade in a historical context.6 While trade here is international in the sense
of between cities in independent polities, the ethnic and cultural proximity of the population
suggests elements of domestic trade as well. We will return to this issue in section 6. As this
is an unbalanced panel, sample composition might be of concern. Therefore, we emphasize
results from a sample where each city has more than sixty percent of all possible observations
(shown as the Base Sample in Table 1A). Cities from two polities, Bavaria and Mecklenburg,
are strongly represented in the sample; as our analysis will show, this does not drive the results
(see Table 5).
The sample covers many of the largest cities, such as Berlin, Hamburg, and München, but
also relatively small towns such as Boizenburg. The distribution of city size in the sample is
approximately log-normal, see Figure 8. Speci cally, the inclusion of the smaller cities means
that the left tail is covered relatively well; whereas focusing on population sizes of 5,000 and
above, a common data restriction, would mean the left tail is largely absent. There is no comprehensive information on migration for these cities. Migration movements however often led
to redistricting. Hence, we can gauge the importance of migration by employing an alternative
population series that incorporates redistricting. The main sources of population data are the
eKompendium German HGIS, Kunz (2013a), and Deutsches Städtebuch, Keyser (1939).
Our measure of trade is the absolute value of the percentage price di¤erence of wheat (p)
between two cities (j and k) in a given year (t) : or P _gapjkt  jln (pjt )

ln(pkt )j : The Law

of One Price is a central equilibrium condition in the theory of arbitrage, and the literature
that has studied deviations from the Law of One Price is voluminous.7 Grain was the main
6

To reduce the inuence of the regionally varying customs liberalizations, we exclude city-pairs between which
customs barriers were already abolished by 1820; see Keller and Shiue (2013) on the customs liberalizations
during this period.
7
For example, Dybvig and Ross (1987), Froot, Kim, and Rogo¤ (1995), and ORourke and Williamson (1999).
Engel and Rogers (1996) study the variability of price gaps.

9

foodstu¤ during this time when the majority of the workforce was still working in agriculture,
and among all grains wheat was the most important one in this area. The local price of
wheat was primarily a¤ected by random weather uctuations determining local harvests, and
the integration of wheat markets across space.8 Even though there were some regions that
had a comparative advantage, including the Black Sea area, Eastern Prussia, and the United
States of America, wheat was produced in the vicinity of most sample cities, with the identity
of exporters and importers changing over time. While some producers were big, there was a
su¢ciently large number of small-scale suppliers producing a relatively homogeneous good that
the assumption of a perfectly competitive market seems reasonable as an approximation.
Generally, both price and quantity measures have been extensively used to study trade (e.g.,
O Rourke and Williamson 1999, Frankel and Romer 1999, respectively). Quantity information
tends to be less available in historical settings such as ours. Since we do not have information
on the quantities of wheat that were traded, a given price gap tells us only that the transactions costs cannot have been larger than the price gap (because that would be inconsistent with
arbitrage), and not the precise level of transactions costs. At the same time, declining transport costs due to steam railways, improved contract enforcement, or increased trust between
traders, among other things, are all plausibly reected in lower price gaps. Moreover, because
of its of central importance, wheat has been studied more than any other commodity in preand early-industrial Europe (e.g., Persson 1999, Jacks 2006, and Federico 2007). For lack of
direct evidence, we have to assume that wheat is representative for inferring transaction costs
for other goods. One advantage of wheat relative to most other goods is that it is rather homogeneous so that there is little reason to believe that the quality shipped varied substantially
with distance (Alchian-Allen conjecture). In the empirical sections 4.3 and 4.4, we will examine the importance of not directly observing trade by separating out major coastal and inland
waterway ports. Due to the low cost of ship transport, it is plausible to assume that trade took
place in these cities more frequently than in other cities, and price di¤erences involving these
port cities would then be equal to, as opposed to the upper bound of, transactions costs.
The information on institutional change is developed along the lines of ACJR. For every city
8

We abstract from storage, which we believe was not of rst-order importance for the analysis. For treatments
of trade-cum-storage, see Shiue (2002) and Steinwender (2014).

10

and year in the sample, we code 0/1 variables for (1) the abolition of guilds, (2) a guarantee
of equality before the law, and (3) the possibility to redeem feudal lands. Any of these three
conditions are indicative of good institutions in the sense that they are conducive to economic
e¢ciency. Perhaps most controversial is the abolition of guilds. In late 18th century Germany,
guilds tended to control entry to all major occupations and also at times restricted the adoption
of new technologies (Ogilvie 2004). While guilds in Europe and other countries have not always
been in the way of economic e¢ciency (Epstein 1998, Shiue and Keller 2007), on balance we
hypothesize that the abolition of guilds is a sign of improvement of economic institutions. The
empirical results below are consistent with this hypothesis.9
Note that these three indicators capture aspects of regulation for di¤erent economic sectors. Moreover, each of these variables is a proxy for regulations a¤ecting a whole range of
activities. For example, the regulation of crafts that abolished the requirement of guild membership (Gewerbefreiheit) often coincided with equivalent concessions permitting the setting
up of manufacturing activities. Similarly, the year in which equality before the law was guaranteed through a written civil code was correlated with the presence of a written commercial
code. In general, these indicators could be interpreted as a general sign of an e¢ciency-oriented
economy, rather than as the institutions that matter for economic performance.
We de ne the institutions in a particular city k and year t, Instkt as the average of these
0/1 indicators. We refer to this at times as the institutional quality of a city. Further, when
the unit of analysis is the city pair we form the average of the institutional qualities of the
two cities in that pair. As will become clear from the analysis below, the main results are not
speci c to particular ways of de ning institutional quality.
Our measure of railways is based on the development of the railway network over time.
We employ digital maps showing the location of train lines in every year of the 19th century
(Kunz 2013b). The Railjkt variable equals one if in year t there existed a direct railway
connection between cities j and k; and zero otherwise.10 It is parallel to the information on
9

ACJR employ a second agricultural institutions indicator, the abolition of serfdom; we have considered this
variable as well, nding that it does not add much to our analysis.
10
Freight rates, on which we do not have comprehensive information, presumably increased with distance.
Because our 0/1 railway variable does not capture that, we include bilateral distance directly in the regression.

11

price gaps in that it covers rich bilateral variation. Note that the bilateral rail connections are
not independentthe rail connection between München and Bamberg went over Nurnberg, for
example (see Figure 3)and consequently, if railways did a¤ect the strength of arbitrage this
e¤ect would not be identical for all city pairs. The importance of this e¤ect varies with bilateral
distance, which will be included in all speci cations below.
Table 1A reports the earliest bilateral train connection for each city in the sample. For
example, the rst train connection in the sample was in the year 1841, for both Dresden and
Leipzig, because in this year the direct line between these two cities was opened. Alternatively
one could conceivably de ne a city-level variable that is equal to one when a city gets its rst
railway station, or a variable that counts the number of railway connections to other sample
cities. This could be misleading in the German context, however, because numerous local
railroad networks were started simultaneously but actual connections between them occurred
only much later.11
The instrumental variable for institutional change is the length of French rule during the
period 1793 to 1815. The fact that French rule was externally imposed is an attractive feature,
from the point of view of this approach. In addition, the primary French motives were not
economic but defensive (bu¤er zone versus Austria and Prussia) and ideological (exporting the
ideas of the French revolution) in nature. Our variable is de ned as e¤ective French rulethat
is, rule through France or through a French-controlled satellite state, excluding purely military
occupations in the area in which a particular city is located.12 The length of French rule ranges
from 0 to 19 years in our sample, with higher values mostly in Germanys west and northwest,
see Table 1B.
We employ the costs of operating a particular railway as instrumental variable. A major
determinant of whether a particular route would be built in the rst place has to do with
the feasibility and costs of operating a track. Railway costs are derived from Nicolls (1878)
who presents information on how much freight capacity had to be given up when operating on
steeper versus atter terrain. According to this source, if a locomotive has 1,200 tons pulling
capacity on at land, this goes down to 1,150 tons with a gradient of 5 feet to the mile, down
11
12

Also, we include city xed e¤ects which account for di¤erences in when cities had their rst railway.
In addition to moving to a city-level analysis, we have extended ACJRs dataset, see Appendix A.

12

to 939 tons if the gradient is 10 feet to the mile, and so on (see Appendix A for details). Using
this information to t a smooth cost function, we apply the ArcGIS least-cost distance module
in a 90 by 90 meter grid to compute the costs of the least-cost railway routes for all city pairs
in the sample. Because these railway costs necessarily increase with distance between cities j
and k; we divide by distance to arrive at the average gradient cost of terrain between j and
k in terms of foregone railway freight capacity. Summary statistics for this data are given in
Table 1B.
In addition to this data we employ a range of other variables in the analysis. They include
information on coal deposits (Gutlerbet 2012), religion, secondary schooling (Keyser 1939), ship
transport (Kunz 2014), geographic information on the cities longitude and latitude as well as
their distance from Paris, and other variables. Summary statistics are shown in Table 1B, and
de nitions and sources are given in Table D.

The Impact of Institutions and Railways on Trade

In order to examine the impact of institutions and railways on trade, we use French rule and
railway costs as instrumental variables. The terrain surrounding the location of cities is wellknown to a¤ect the costs of railways (Nicolls 1878), although this hypothesis has not been
tested in this context. Institutional change in German cities during the 19th century is related
to the length of French rule around the turn of the century, building on the work by ACJR. In
this section, we present the identi cation strategy, followed by the reduced form relationship
between trade, railway cost and French rule. We then turn to our estimates of the impact of
railways and institutions on price gaps.

4.1

Identi cation Strategy

Our approach requires that the instrumental variables, railway costs and French rule, a¤ect
the endogenous variables, railways and institutions. This can be tested by the following two

13

regressions:

Railjkt =

3
X

 1s Ist R_costjk +

3
X

s=1

s=1

(2)

 2s Ist F rench_rulejk +  jk +  t + Q

and
Instjkt =

 1s Ist R_costjk +

s=1

s=1

where Railjkt is a dichotomous variable which is 1 if there was a direct train connection between
cities j and k in year t; Instjkt is an index of the average institutional quality in cities j and
k in year t; R_costjk is the log cost of railway operation between cities j and k; per unit of
distance; and F rench_rulejk is the average years of French rule in cities j and k. Further, Ist
is an indicator variable for each of three time-windows of roughly equal length (1820-35, 18401860, and 1865-1880), while  jk ;  jk and  t ;  t are city-pair and year xed e¤ects, respectively.
P
0
The term Q is equal to 3s=1 s Ist Distjk ; with Distjk de ned as the bilateral distance between
cities j and k; distance may be important for the impact of railways on price gaps, and it could
also be that transport costs changed di¤erentially for short versus longer distances.
We then use railway costs and French rule as instrumental variables in the following regression:
P _gapjkt =

1 Railjkt

+

2 Instjkt

+

jk

+

0

t

+ Q ' + "jkt ;

(3)

where P _gapjkt ; our measure of trade, is the absolute value of the percentage di¤erence in the
prices of wheat of cities j and k in year t:
This instrumental variables approach requires the following two assumptions (Angrist and
Pischke 2009, Ch. 4.4, 4.5). First, railway costs and French rule must be correlated with
the establishment of railway connections and institutional change. Second, railway costs and
French rule must be uncorrelated with other determinants of trade: corr(R_costjk "jkt ) = 0
and corr(F rench_rulejk "jkt ) = 0: These exclusion restrictions will be satis ed if conditional
on covariates, railway costs and French rule are as good as randomly assigned and if railway
costs and French rule have no e¤ect on the price gap through channels other than railways and

14

institutional change.
The reduced form regression between price gaps and the instrumental variables is given by:

P _gapjkt =

3
X

1s Ist R_costjk +

s=1

3
X

0

2s Ist F rench_rulejk + jk + t + Q  + jkt :

(4)

s=1

While the exclusion restrictions rely on correlations with the unobservable "jkt and are
hence untestable, we shed light on the plausibility of the exclusion restrictions by augmenting
the reduced-form regression (4) with other variables, Z:

P _gapjkt =

3
X

1s Ist R_costjk +

s=1

3
X

0

2s Ist F rench_rulejk + jk + t + Q  + Z 0 z + jkt : (5)

s=1

This sheds light on the exclusion restrictions because if the reduced-form coe¢cients 1s and
2s change drastically upon the inclusion of a particular Z, French rule and railway costs are
not uncorrelated with jkt ; which signals the possibility that the instrumental variables operate
not exclusively through railways and institutions.13
In section 5 of the paper, French rule and railway costs will serve as instrumental variables
in our city growth analysis. Analogous requirements for that instrumental variables approach
exist and will be discussed below.

4.2

The Reduced-Form Relationship between French Rule, Railway
Costs, and Price Gaps

We begin with the reduced-form price gap regression, equation (4)

P _gapjkt =

1s Ist R_costjk +

2s Ist F rench_rulejk + jk + t + Q  + jkt :

The coe¢cients on the time-invariant variables F rench_rule and R_cost can be estimated in
addition to city-pair xed e¤ects because the instrumental variables have a time-varying e¤ect
through the inclusion of twenty-year window indicators, Ist . This is important especially for

railway costs: they should matter only once steam locomotives arrived in Germany, which was
after the year 1835.
The OLS coe¢cients for railway cost are both positive, indicating that higher railway costs
lead to higher price gaps (Table 2, column 1).14 This is in line with expectations: high railway
costs mean few railways, which kept price gaps relatively high. In contrast, French rule reduces
price gaps, consistent with French rule leading to institutional improvements that bene ted
trade.15 These results are supportive of the instrumental variables approach.
Robustness Checks We rst consider the importance of sampling for our results. In the
present case, the inuence of changes in sample composition appear to be limited because we
nd the results with the sample of all 40 cities to be similar as those for the base sample (see
column 2, versus column 1, respectively). Second, we see that the mere existence of French
rule, a 0/1 indicator, is less strongly correlated with price gaps than the length of French rule
in years; this provides support to the instrumental variables strategy (column 3). Third, we
turn to speci cation issues. The dependent variable, P _gap is bounded from below by zero
in contrast to OLS which assumes support from

1 to +1: OLS is also relatively prone to

outliers. To see whether boundedness and outliers unduly bias our ndings we apply other
estimation methods. Using median regression gives broadly similar results to OLS (Table 2,
column 4). Moving closer to the lower bound, column 5 shows that at the 25th percentile the
impact of French rule and railway costs is qualitatively the same as according to OLS. These
results suggest that the boundedness of P _gap does not greatly a¤ect the OLS results. We also
employ a robust regression routine that lowers the inuence of outliers, nding less precisely
estimated but broadly similar results (column 6).
Overall, the e¤ects of railway costs and French rule on price gaps are as expected.

4.3

Instrument Validity: the Trade Exclusion Restrictions

The previous section documented the reduced-form relationship between railway costs, French
rule, and price gaps. Here we present evidence on these relationships in the presence of other
14
15

Compared to the omitted period of 1820-35, where 1 is zero by construction.
The omitted period is 1865-1880, when French rule had no longer a price-gap reducing e¤ect.

16

channels that might be at work. For example, a di¢cult section of terrain such as a mountain
range might present challenges not only to railways but also to other means of transport that
could change price gaps. If the other potential correlates did not change much over time, such
as foot tra¢c over the mountain range, then this will be captured by the city pair xed e¤ects.
Some factors may have changed however, and here we address a number of them.
Our approach is to estimate the augmented reduced form regression (5) and to see whether
the reduced form coe¢cients on French rule and railway costs are a¤ected in the presence of
alternative explanations, which are introduced one at a time. Results are shown in Table 3.
Column 1 gives the reduced-form results of Table 2, column 6 again. Column 2 presents the rst
alternative, which is an indicator of whether the two cities were connected by railway according
to Lists 1833 railway plan. If the List plan anticipated early railway building, the inclusion of
this variable may weaken the railway cost coe¢cients, and it may also detect whether price gap
reductions are just a sign of a generally promising region. To allow for possibly time-varying
e¤ects we include the List plan variable interacted with a xed e¤ect for each decade;16 these
coe¢cients are shown in the lower part of Table 3. We see from the results that the List variable
has no major e¤ect on price gaps, and the reduced form railway and French rule coe¢cients
are largely unchanged.
Second, railways were particularly important for coal-producing areas because they allowed
for cost e¤ective trade in coal. Further, coal producing areas experienced relatively high growth
during the 19th century, and this growth may have reduced price gaps.17 While coal was
important in Germanys 19th century industrialization, there is little evidence to suggest that
coal has a major e¤ect on our identi cation strategy (column 3).
Third, geography and climate of an economy may be an important fundamental cause of
economic growth (Diamond 1997, Sachs 2001), and we know that geography helps to explain
the extent of trade (Tinbergen 1962, Nunn and Puga 2012). While climatic di¤erences in the
sample are relatively small, di¤erences in elevation are more pronounced. Northern areas in
Germany tend to be level whereas signi cant elevations are seen in the South. We look for the
16

The exception to this are the nal years of the sample period, 1865-80.
Gutlerbet (2012) has emphasized the role of coal for regional development in 19th century Germany recently.
The promise of future growth in German coal areas may also be one reason for French rule.
17

17

e¤ects of geography in terms of latitude and longitude. Latitude tends to enter with a negative
coe¢cient (column 4), perhaps reecting the greater availability of cheap waterway transport
in the North of Germany.18 At the same time, conditional on covariates there is no evidence
that latitude or longitude are highly correlated with price gaps and the proposed instrumental
variables.
Fourth, there may also be cultural di¤erences that explain why price gaps came down at
di¤erent speeds. For example, Max Weber (1930) famously argued that the Protestant work
ethic is conducive to economic e¢ciency. In line with Webers thesis, we nd that price gaps
tend to be lower among predominantly Protestant cities, though this e¤ect is more or less
orthogonal to our instrumental variables (column 6). Becker and Woessmann (2009) have
recently emphasized that Protestantism is highly correlated with human capital accumulation
in 19th century Prussia. To examine these issues, we include an indicator for whether a city
had formal secondary schooling (Gymnasiums) early on, which is seen as a general measure of
the local emphasis on human capital. Our results are in line with Becker and Woessmanns
ndings in the sense that the patterns of coe¢cients for Protestantism and human capital are
quite similar (columns 6 and 7). At the same time, the French rule and railway cost coe¢cients
remain largely unchanged.19
Fifth, another consideration is that the probability of French rule may have been negatively
correlated with the distance from Paris, not least because a short distance kept military and
occupation costs relatively low. As we are interested in the impact of French rule on the
institutions of German cities, and not the mere fact that a city was ruled by France, we present
a speci cation with the distance from Paris on the right hand side. If the inclusion of distance
from Paris wipes out the French rule coe¢cients we cannot identify the institutions e¤ect on
price gaps. However, the relative ease of occupation as captured by distance from Paris does
not account for the entire French rule e¤ect (column 8).
As the sixth factor, we consider the inuence of water transport and international trade.
18

We measure latitude in column 4 as the average latitude of the two cities, recognizing that when the two
cities latitudes are quite di¤erent the average will not be close to either citys latitude. We have explored this
issue by rede ning the variable, nding that it has only a limited e¤ect in our analysis. A number of results are
shown in Table A, columns (4A) and (5A).
19
Similar results are obtained using the actual year of opening of a citys rst Gymnasium.

18

Rail transport competed with waterway transport, and transport costs by water fell over time
as well.20 While adding an indicator of waterway location shows that cities with access to
water transport experienced more rapidly declining price gaps, the railway cost coe¢cients
do not change by much (column 9). Further, the nature of wheat trade in central Europe
changed during the 19th century due to increasing imports from the United States of America.
If important, it should a¤ect coastal cities more than other sample areas, especially at times
of low grain prices in the United States. Including an indicator for this into the reduced form
we see quite similar patterns as before, making it unlikely that such e¤ects greatly a¤ect our
instrumental variables strategy (column 10).21
The waterway indicators are also useful to assess the importance that in general the price
gaps give only the upper bound as opposed to the exact level of bilateral transactions costs.
Port cities had access to the low-cost mode of transportation during this time (Gutlerbet 2012,
Table 2), making it likely that wheat was traded at these cities in virtually every period (even
when a port city would not export its own wheat production or import for its own consumption,
there could be entrepôt trade). This allows us to examine how important it is for our results
that it is unobserved whether trade actually took place in a given year between two particular
cities. The reduced-form results in Table 3 are not very di¤erent when we control for ship
transport or not (column 1 versus columns 9 and 10), which suggests that the fact that price
gaps are only equal to transactions costs whenever there is actual trade plays a limited role in
our analysis. This result is in line with recent ndings in Steinwender (2014).22
These results may be summarized as follows. While there are some changes in the reducedform coe¢cients through the inclusion of other variables, the signs on the proposed instrumental
variables never change, and the highest p-value of the test of joint signi cance for the instrumental variables is 0.8%, compared to 0.2% in the baseline estimation. Overall, the results of
Table 3 provide support that the trade exclusion restrictions hold.
20

See Gutlerbet (2012), Table 2.
We have also considered communications improvements such as the telegraph, however, city-level information was not available to us.
22
There, whether one focuses on periods in which there is trade or not, the evidence that the introduction
of the telegraph lowered the New York-Liverpool price gap for cotton is equally strong in a statistical sense
(Steinwender 2014, Table 2).

The Impact of Institutions and Railways on Trade

In this section, the rst stage relationships between instrumental variables and the endogenous
variables, institutions and railways, are analyzed. We also explore whether these relationships
di¤er across various subgroups in the sample to see how local the relationships are.

First-stage Relationships We begin with the rst-stage relationship between the instrumental variables and institutional change, see Table 4, column 1. A longer French rule leads
to a higher institutional quality. This is consistent with French rule triggering institutional
improvements, in line with ACJRs ndings at the level of polities. The rst-stage F-statistic
is 4.30. Even though it is lower than the rule of thumb of 10 proposed by Staiger and Stock
(1997), French rule is not a weak instrument. The F-statistic is robust and the city-pair level
clustering allows for an arbitrary variance-covariance matrix capturing potential serial correlation in the residual error term (Wooldridge 2002). The individual coe¢cients for French rule
are each signi cant at a 1% level, the p-value of the F-statistic is 0.2%, and the partial R2 is
0.18.23 In the following discussion, the focus will be on the railway rst stage because railway
costs R_costjkt is intrinsically a bilateral variable and as such it is particularly well suited to
city-pair analysis. We will return to the institutions rst stage in section 5.4 below.
We estimate negative coe¢cients on railway costs (signi cant in 1840-60), indicating that
higher railway costs reduced the probability of a railway connection between two cities, relative
to the placebo period of 1820-35 during which steam locomotives were not yet available in
Germany (Table 4, column 2). The

rst-stage F-statistic is around 25 and the p-value is

virtually 0. French rule tends to lower the chance that railways exist. As noted above, France
was slower than Germany in building railway lines so this is consistent with the impact of
French rule on institutions.
The instrumental variables approach will estimate the impact of railways on price gaps for
those city-pairs that were induced by relatively low railway costs to establish railways. To
see which types of cities were a¤ected by railway costs, we estimate the railway rst stage for
23

See also Angrist and Krueger (2009, 215) on these issues, including an update on Staiger and Stock (1997).

20

various subsamples of our data. This also shows whether the instrumental variables estimates
are very localthat is, whether railway costs matter only for a few observationsor not.
We rst distinguish cities that are relatively far from each other from others that are more
nearby. The coe¢cients on railway cost tend to be negative and quite similar (columns 3 and
4). Distinguishing cities that are relatively far from Paris from those that are closer to Paris
shows that high railway costs deterred railway building in both subsamples (columns 5 and 6).
Further, while railway connections were generally more prevalent in Protestant than in Catholic
areas, high railway costs reduced railway building in both sets of cities (columns 7 and 8). There
is also evidence that high railway costs deterred railway building for cities with access to water
transport (column 9).24 The reason for this may be that most navigable rivers in Germany ow
South to North so that transport in the East-West dimension still requires overland transport,
including by rail. Overall these results indicate that the rst-stage relationship for railways
holds in a number of subsamples, and our instrumental variable estimates are not identi ed
from a small number of special observations.
We now estimate the e¤ect of railways and institutions on price gaps:
P _gapjkt =

1 Railjkt

+

2 Instjkt

+

jk

+

0

t

+ Q ' + "jkt :

The railway instrumental variables coe¢cient is about -0.1 and the institutions coe¢cient
is about -0.4 (Table 5, column 1).25 Both the introduction of railways and better institutions
improved trade in the sense of bringing down price gaps. The instrumental variables coe¢cients
are larger (in absolute value) than the OLS which are also shown. There could be a number of
reasons for this, including measurement error in the railways and institutions variables, or that
OLS su¤ers from omitted variables bias. Another potential reason is that instrumental variable
estimation for railways measures the local average treatment e¤ect on city pairs induced to have
24

The subsample of waterway city pairs is relatively small, and no overly strong conclusions should be drawn.
The Kleibergen-Paap (2006) F statistic here is 21.65, well above Stock and Yogos (2005) critical value for
10% maximal bias and iid errors of 4.72 (LIML), providing more evidence on the power of the instruments.
Results from overidenti cation tests are not reported because it can be expected that the second-stage results
depend on which subset of instruments is employed, given that we have two endogenous variables. The rst
stage regressions of Table 5, column 1 are shown in Table 4, columns 1 and 2. Full detail on the rst stages of
Table 5 are not reported for space reasons; they are available upon request from the authors.
25

21

railways (whereas OLS measures the correlation across the full sample), or the instrumental
variables violate the exclusion restrictions. These possibilities cannot be fully evaluated because
they depend on characteristics that are not observed.
However, it is unlikely that violating the exclusion restrictions is the main reason why the
instrumental variable estimates are larger (in absolute value) than the OLS because above
we have seen little evidence that the instrumental variables are, conditional on covariates,
correlated with other determinants of price gaps (Table 3). Additionally, the impact of the
instrumental variables was not systematically di¤erent depending on the strength of the rst
stage (Table 4). In contrast, omitted variables bias is likely, given the many factors that could
inuence railway building and institutional change, and because both railway and institutions
variables vary only between 0 and 1, measurement error is likely as well. Moreover, to the
extent that the introduction of steam ships improved trade for waterway cities, the substitution
between railways and steam ships would mean OLS is upwardly biased, consistent with our
nding that the OLS estimates are larger than the instrumental variables estimates.
The institutions e¤ect is quantitatively larger than that of railways, with standardized beta
coe¢cients of -0.76 and -0.20, respectively. Some readers may nd this result surprising at rst.
However, it has become increasingly clear that institutions a¤ect trade in a range of markets
(product, nancial, and labor). Also, not only formal institutions de ning the contracting and
property rights environment matter but informal institutions sustained by repeated interaction,
networks, or cultural beliefs do so as well.26

Robustness checks We rst examine the inuence of the city pair structure of the data
on our inferences. A disturbance to the price in city k will a¤ect all observations involving
city k; and to address this issue we cluster by city (not city-pair); as seen from column 1A,
our inferences are unchanged. Second, we explore the role of our railway cost variable. The
bilateral railway cost proxy is derived from an U.S. railway building manual using a speci c
cost function (see Appendix A for details), for example. However, if instead we abstract from
the speci c values and map our railway cost measures into ten bins with values from 1 to 10,
26

See Nunn and Treer (2013). These authors examine the relationship between domestic institutions and
comparative advantage, but similar arguments apply to trade that is not based on comparative advantage.

22

the results are similar (Table 5, column 2). This suggests that the speci c values of our railway
cost estimates play a limited role.
We then gauge the inuence of changing sample composition by comparing the restricted
with the full-sample results, nding no qualitative di¤erence. The representativeness of our
sample cities for Germany as a whole is explored in the city- and state-weighted regressions.
The nding that both railways and institutional change reduce price gaps holds also when we
reduce the number of Bavarian and Mecklenburg cities in the sample (see Table 5, columns 3
to 7).
We examine whether alternative de nitions of institutions and French rule change the results. There is a smaller impact of institutions if redeemability of feudal lands is incorporated
in the de nition of institutions, although it still remains larger than the railways e¤ect (for
this and the following, see Table 6). Results are similar if we adopt a 0/1 measure of French
rule, or code French rule in the Hanse cities (Hamburg, Bremen, and Luebeck) the same as
everywhere else even though the nature of French rule there was di¤erent.27 The 19th century is
also a period of broad political change, and we explore the impact of wars, the 1848 revolution,
and the formation of the Zollverein, nding that the inuence of these events on the results is
limited.
Two other issues are

rst, the de nition of P _gap; our measure of trade, and second,

potential spillover e¤ects. To the extent that waterway observations are more informative on
transactions costs than non-waterway observations because water transport was low-cost and
hence there was more frequently trade, separating out waterway observations is a way to see
whether more informative observations give substantially di¤erent results. We nd that this is
not the case (compare column 9 of Table 6 with column 1, Table 5).
Second, there could be spillovers from a rail connection between cities j and k for other
cities, and these may either be positive or negative. This is a well-known challenge in research
on place-based infrastructure projects that we cannot fully resolve in this paper. It is possible
to shed some light on this issue in our historical setting, however, because early railways were
27

The overriding goal of French rule in the Hanse cities was to enforce the continental blockade towards
England, which by its very nature was detrimental to trade.

23

generally built on a state-by-state basis and centered on the state capital. This created a huband-spoke system, and a new rail connection between two state capitals often led to connections
between smaller cities in di¤erent states as well. If there are substantial positive spillovers, then
one would expect them to result from rail connections between state capitals. Excluding state
capitals from the sample, however, leads to qualitatively similar results as before (Table 6,
column 10). This suggests that spillovers of this type do not a¤ect the main ndings.
Exploring the robustness of our results further, we introduce the same factors that were
considered earlier directly as additional controls in the instrumental variables estimation equation:
P _gapjkt =

1 Railjkt

+

2 Instjkt

+

jk

+

0

t

+Q

x

+ Z0

z

+ "jkt

(6)

For example, we ask whether adding an indicator variable for being on Lists railway plan from
the year 1833 changes the instrumental variables results. Results are shown in Table A in the
Appendix; this table also addresses the issue that variables such as latitude have no natural
city-pair level de nition by presenting results for alternative de nitions. Overall, the results
shown in Table A con rm our results. The inclusion of additional variables does not weaken
identi cation, the railways and institutions impact on price gaps remains quite similar to that
in the baseline regression without additional variables, and our approach to de ne the city-pair
average of variables such as latitude has no strong bearing on the results.
We now turn to the relationship between institutions, trade, and growth.

5

Institutions, Trade, and Growth

In this section, we are interested in the institutions impact on growth through trade.28 Using
the result from the previous section that institutional change a¤ects trade, we have
City_Sizekt =

1 T rade (Inst; X)kt

+ "kt ;

(7)

28
For simplicity here we focus on trade, not also railways, and write T rade(Inst; X) in the following. The
railway impact should be picked up by trade because railway costs is one of our instruments.

24

and the question is how much of institutions e¤ect on city growth goes through trade ( 1 )
versus not through trade ( 2 ):
City_Sizekt =

1 T rade (Inst; X)kt

+

2 Instkt

+ "kt :

(8)

Since institutions may be endogenous (and trade surely is) we employ French rule and railway
costs as instrumental variables. Note that institutions and city size vary at the level of the
city while our measure of trade (the price gap between cities j and k) is a city-pair variable.
To implement equations (7) and (8) we map city-pair analysis to a regression at the level of
the city. We adopt the two-sample instrumental variables approach introduced by Angrist and
Krueger (1992).29 In the current context, this amounts to constructing city-level averages of
city-pair variables. The approach is described in Appendix B.
In the following, we focus on the reduced-form relationship between city size and the proposed instrumental variables. We then estimate the impact of trade on city size (equation 7),
before turning to the role of trade in the overall impact of institutions on growth (equation 8).
The section concludes with a discussion of our ndings.

5.1

The Reduced-Form Relationship between French Rule, Railway
Costs, and City Size

In the reduced form we estimate the impact of French rule and railway cost on city population.
Consider the following equation:

City_Sizekt =  +

3
X

s1 Ist F rench_Rulek +

s=1

3
X

s2 Ist (R_costk )

+ ukt :

(9)

s=1

The dependent variable is the log of the population of city k in year t; F rench_Rulek is the log
length of French rule of city k in years plus one, and R_costk is the average of the railway costs
of city k to other cities j in the sample. The sample variation is in city and time dimension
29

Earlier work on trade and growth using a two-sample approach includes Frankel and Romer (1999) who
aggregate bilateral trade estimates from a gravity equation to the country level. More broadly, see also Angrist
and Pischke (2009, 147-150) and Inoue and Solon (2010).

25

(K  T ), as opposed to city pair and time dimension (JK  T ): In the baseline sample there
are 268 observations, down from 2,166 city pair observations. Equation (9) includes city- and
year xed e¤ects, as well as the average bilateral distance between city k and its trade partners:
P
 k + t + 3s=1 s3 Ist (distk ): The latter is the city-level counterpart of bilateral distance
between j and k:
If French rule caused institutional improvements that led to city growth, it should enter
equation (9) with positive coe¢cients. Moreover, if high railway costs held back trade because
they reduced railway building, we expect negative coe¢cients on railway costs after 1835 (once
steam locomotives had become available). The estimation results for equation (9) are shown in
Table 7, column 1. While not all coe¢cients are statistically signi cant, the results are in line
with the proposed instrumental variables e¤ects. The institutions result also con rms ACJRs
analysis at the city level. Similar results are obtained for the full sample of forty cities (column
2). We also present results that downweigh inuential observations. While this raises slightly
the French rule e¤ects and lowers those of railway cost, the results are broadly similar (column
3). Overall, these results support the instrumental variables strategy.

5.2

The City Size Exclusion Restrictions

Are the instrumental variables valid in the city size regression? In addition to being quasirandomly assigned, the instrumental variables can neither directly impact city size nor be
strongly correlated with a determinant of city size. We have seen above that railway costs do
not have a large impact on institutional change (Table 4). The previous section has shown that
French rule a¤ects trade, so if trade impacts city size clearly there is room for French rule to
a¤ect city size through another channel, namely trade. Does this invalidate the instrumental
variables strategy? No, because a better trade environment is in part caused by institutional
change, which is the link that we are interested in. Identi cation requires independence conditional on the included covariates, and the question is whether French rule is correlated with
trade or other determinants of city size that are not controlled for. To see how likely this is we
estimate the city size reduced form equation (9) augmented with other plausible determinants
of city size; our main interest is whether the reduced-form estimates on railway cost and French

26

rule are substantially changed.
Results are shown in Table 8. Each of the columns 2 to 9 reports results from introducing,
exibly with decade xed e¤ects, one possible determinant of city size on the right hand side of
equation (9). For example, in column 2 the added variable is coal production. While city size
is higher in coal areas in the early sample years, the coe¢cients for the proposed instrumental
variables do not change much compared to the baseline in column 1. This provides support for
the identi cation strategy.
While the determinants of city size need not be the same as those of trade, many are
plausibly the same and we analyze largely the same group as discussed earlier in Table 3.
Geography in terms of latitude tends to amplify the coe¢cients on French rule and railway cost
and does not pose a threat to identi cation. Cities further east tend to be smaller as the results
for longitude show (column 4). The French rule coe¢cients shrink somewhat upon inclusion
of longitude, which is not surprising given that French rule was less prevalent further east;
importantly, the coe¢cients on French rule are positive even after controlling for longitude.
Adding Protestantism yields results similar to those for latitude, probably because Protestants
tended to live in the north while Catholics lived in the south of the German areas.
Looking at human capital as a determinant of city size, there is no evidence that relatively
early establishment of secondary education a¤ected city growth in our sample (column 6).
Including distance to Paris would reduce the French rule coe¢cients if the French successfully
targeted to rule areas with a high growth potential. We nd, if anything, the opposite (column
7). Turning to the ease of trade, rst we see that the location of a city on a waterway does
not consistently a¤ect city population (column 8). In contrast, cities that were relatively more
likely to engage in international trade because they were on the coast tend to be relatively
large (column 9). Di¤erences in access to coastal trade and international markets obscure to
some extent the detrimental impact of railway costs on city size, because controlling for coastal
location ampli es the negative impact of high railway costs on city size.
Taken together, railway costs and institutions have reduced-form city size e¤ects in line
with expectations, a result that is robust to the inclusion of other potential determinants of
city size. This supports the proposed instrumental variables strategy.
27

In the following section, we turn to the instrumental variables estimation.

5.3

The Trade Channel of Institutions E¤ect on City Size

In this section we estimate the e¤ect of trade on city size using the following speci cation:
City_Sizekt =

+

1 T rade (Inst; X)kt

+ ukt :

(10)

French rule and railway costs are employed as instrumental variables for trade. The rst stage
regression is as follows:

P _gapjkt =

3
X
s=1

1s Ist R_costjk +

3
X

0

2s Ist F rench_rulejk + jk + t + Q  + jkt ;

(11)

s=1

Applying the two-sample instrumental variables approach, we construct a city-level measure of
average price gaps from the predicted values of equation (11), see Appendix B. This variable
is in turn inserted into equation (10) to estimate
City_Sizekt =

+

1

:
\

1 T rade(Inst; X)kt

+ ukt ;

(12)

\ X)kt in order to emphasize that this trade variable captures the
where we write T rade(Inst;
impact of institutional change. We obtain an estimate of

4:75; signi cant at a 5% level (Table

9, column 1).30 This provides evidence that institutions increase growth by reducing price gaps
in our sample. We can use median regression instead of least squares in the rst stage to address
the boundedness of price gaps; it leads to a similar estimate (though the rst stage is weaker;
see column 2). The question we turn to in the next section is the extent to which institutions
exert their impact on growth through trade.
30

Following Bjorklund and Jantti (1997), for valid inferences we bootstrap over the two-sample instrumental
variables procedure.

5.4

Institutions and Growth: Trade versus non-Trade Channels

To determine the importance of trade for the impact of institutions on growth, ideally we would
like to put institutions and trade in the city size equation. If adding institutions turns the e¤ect
of trade to zero, then trade is not an important proximate factor for institutions. Trade plays
a role only if it remains signi cant after institutions in included. We have just estimated the
impact of trade on growth, see equation (12). One can recast our question by asking whether
Inst is an important omitted variable in this equation. Adding institutions to equation (12)
yields
City_Sizekt =

+

\

1 T rade(Inst; X)kt

+

2 Instkt

+ ukt :

(13)

Given that institutions may be endogenous, we use the length of French rule as an instrumental
variable. Because French rule is used to predict the trade variable, an important question is
whether the instrument has still enough power to estimate

2

separately from

1:

To nd out,

we examine the rst stage relationship between institutions and French rule conditional on
trade.
The institutional quality of a city is increasing in the length of French rule (Table B, column
1), with a p-value of the F-test for inclusion that is virtually zero. In contrast, the trade variable
is far from being signi cant at standard levels. This is evidence that the impact of French rule
on institutions is in part orthogonal to trade. The results also indicate that trade does not a¤ect
institutions. The latter is not always the case; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005b), for
example show that the rise of Atlantic trade did a¤ect institutions in a number of European
countries. We do not know at this point whether this is a true di¤erence relative to their result,
or driven by the speci cs of our context, data, or speci cation.31
Using French rule as the instrumental variable, we turn to estimating the impact of institutions through trade and non-trade channels, equation (13). The institutions coe¢cient is
positivecity size is increasing in institutional qualitythough the coe¢cient is not precisely
31

Also of interest to us is to learn about the characteristics of cities that were induced by French rule to
improve their institutions (columns 2 to 12, Table B). We see that with the exception of cities far from Paris
and in Germanys east, French rule is a signi cant determinant of institutions. Moreover, trade does usually not
have an impact on institutions. Overall, these subsample results provide additional support that an institutions
e¤ect independent of trade can be estimated.

29

estimated and is insigni cant at standard levels (column 3, Table 9). In contrast, trade has a
coe¢cient of about

4:2, not very di¤erent from column 1 (although less precisely estimated).

Alternatively, using median regression for the trade rst stage yields similar conclusions (column
4).32
It is worth emphasizing that the results do not mean that institutions have no causal e¤ect
on growth. Institutions do have a positive impact on long-run growth. This can be seen
perhaps most easily by dropping the trade variable and estimating the impact of institutions
(instrumented with French rule) on growth; the coe¢cient is positive and signi cant at about 0:5
(Table 9, column 5). Rather, our results indicate that trade is important as a channel through
which institutions a¤ect growth in our context. As we have shown in section 4, institutional
change led to changes in trade. It is useful to think about this in terms of timing, as this helps
to establish the causal channels (see also Angrist and Pischke 2009, 68). The trade coe¢cient
picks up an e¤ect that is ultimately due to institutions.
Robustness Checks We rst examine the role of the railway cost instrumental variable.
Using a step function as opposed to the actual railroad cost estimates leads to similar results
(column 6). One might also be concerned that our nding that institutions work through trade
is obtained because our indicators of institutions are relatively close to trade. Equality before
the law, e.g., might matter directly for trade disputes. To explore this issue, we replace equality
before the law with redeemability of feudal lands, an indicator of the power of landowners versus
their tenants. Now the trade coe¢cient is around

4:5, while institutions remains insigni cant

(column 7). Employing a broad de nition of institutions based on all three indicators, the
trade coe¢cient is similar in size (column 8). This suggests that our results are not sensitive
to particular aspects of institutional quality.
We have also explored the role of sample composition for the results. First, consider di¤erent
numbers of observations. In the full sample of 40 cities, the trade coe¢cient is about

3:1 while

the institutions coe¢cient is slightly larger and close to signi cance (p-value of 0.139; column
1, Table 10). Full sample results for the broad institutions measure are similar (column 2).
32

The complete rst-stage results of the speci cations in Table 9 are available upon request from the authors.

30

The results are not driven by the low-population states because we nd similar results with
state-population weighting (column 3). There is more evidence that city size matters: the trade
coe¢cient changes to about

1:7 when the regression is weighted by city size, suggesting that

the impact was relatively larger for the smaller cities in the sample.
Next, we turn to the creation of the Zollverein customs union. It might not only explain
part of the gains from trade, but, as a tool of Prussia to rule other German areas, the Zollverein
might be correlated with the growth e¤ects of Germanys political uni cation. To see whether
this might be important we include the geography-based predictor of Zollverein membership of
Keller and Shiue (2013). As it turns out, the Zollverein predictor does not strongly a¤ect the
trade nor the institutions coe¢cient (Table 10, column 5). The same holds when we include
controls for revolutionary activity around the year 1848 and the wars during the sample period
(columns 6 and 7).
How strong is the evidence for spillover e¤ects in the sense that improvements in one citys
trade a¤ected growth of another city? As before, we drop state capitals from the sample, nding
that the trade coe¢cient is considerably smaller than before (column 8, Table 10, compared to
column 3, Table 9). Apparently, a given improvement in trade a¤ects growth in state capitals
more strongly than in other cities. In contrast, the treatment status of the Hanse cities, in
which French rule took a special form because it was mainly concerned with enforcing the
continental blockade, does not a¤ect the results by much (column 9).
We conclude this analysis by exploring measurement issues in the left hand side variable. A
potential concern is that city size may not be fully comparable across cities and over time due
to migration between cities. Migration is not fully observed. However, migration often leads to
redistricting of city boundaries, and we have data on an alternative city size series that includes
redistricting. According to column 10, employing the alternative city population series that
includes redistricting leads to similar results as in the baseline (Table 9, column 3). While this
analysis cannot be taken as de nitive, it suggests that migration does not play a rst-order role
for our results.
To summarize, while the trade coe¢cient is not always precisely estimated, it is usually
signi cant and there is a clear pattern: more trade in the sense of lower price gaps is conducive
31

to city growth. There is less evidence for an independent institutions e¤ect capturing the
non-trade e¤ects of institutions.
We now turn to a discussion of these ndings.

5.5

Discussion

Economic Magnitudes How important is the institutions e¤ect through trade, economically speaking? We turn to the instrumental variable estimates of equation (10) for a
quanti cation. Because the estimation exploits within-city changes over time, we relate average annual observed city growth (City_Sizekt ) to average annual predicted city growth,
\ kt , using the longest time di¤erence available for each city (40 to 60 years),
^ T rade(Inst)
1
and ^ 1 =

4:75 (from column 1, Table 9).

We nd that predicting city growth with institutions and trade accounts for more than half of
the variation of city growth, see Figure 9. We can also explain the level of city growth at the low
end of the distribution, while the model tends to underestimate high rates of city growth. How
about the economic importance of institutions through non-trade channels? Taking the point
\ kt +
estimates of column 3, Table 9, and computing predicted city growth as ^ 1 T rade(Inst)
^ 2 Instkt , we can account for about 57 percent of the variation in city size growth, up from
54 percent. Based on these results, trade is an economically signi cant proximate factor in
explaining city growth, and the fundamental behind trade is mostly institutional change, as we
have seen in section 4. Moreover, trade appears to account for a large part of the total impact
of institutions on growth.

Other Forms of Institutions It is possible that trade may be only important as a
proximate cause for institutions impact on growth for the speci c set of institutions that we
consider, but not for all institutions. Perhaps trade is the proximate factor through which
the abolition of trade guilds a¤ects growth, leaving open the possibility that other forms of
institutions have growth e¤ects that are orthogonal to trade.
It is worth keeping in mind that our indicators of institutional change cover a range of
sectors, legal aspects of di¤erent speci city, and they emphasize the situation on the ground (not
32

only de jure but whether rules are enforced). Moreover, our indicators are correlated with other
elements of institutions (civil code went often hand in hand with commercial code, for example).
From this perspective it is reasonable to expect that our indicators are broad correlates of
institutional change. Delineating the precise set of institutions that works through trade is an
important question, but one that would likely require di¤erent identi cation strategies, and we
leave it to future work.
Proximate growth causes correlated with trade Another issue is whether we have
unduly biased the analysis by focusing on trade as the proximate factor through which institutions operate. There may be other factors that are correlated with trade whose impact on
growth we might attribute to trade. With numerous other possible growth factors, of which
there is only a small subset with consistent city-level information for the early 19th century,
there is no de nitive answer to this question. The focus on trade amounts to a type of exclusion
restriction that cannot directly be tested.
The evidence we can bring to bear on this question comes mainly from including other
factors into the empirical analysis. Earlier we have shown that the reduced-form impact of
French rule and railway cost on city size does not vanish when we control for the location of
coal deposits, the propensity to international trade, or religious beliefs, among other things.33
We now extend this analysis by including the same factors Z directly into the instrumental
variables estimation equation (10)
City_Sizekt =

+

1 T rade(Inst; X)kt

+

2 Instkt

+  0 Z + ukt :

(14)

These estimations are purely exploratory checks for remaining omitted variables bias. We do
not have a particular reason to believe, for example, that latitude should a¤ect city growth conditional on trade and institutions. Estimating equation (14) with the two-sample instrumental
variable approach for a range of factors, we nd virtually no factor having a signi cant e¤ects
33

It is true that due to data availability our measures of these factors do not vary over time, as the price gap
measure does, though by introducing decade xed e¤ects we allow for time-varying e¤ects, which should help
make the analysis comparable.

33

on city size once trade and institutions are included (see Table C).34 This provides additional
evidence in support of trade being an important proximate factor through which institutions
a¤ect growth.

How does trade lead to growth? Much of what we know about the impact of institutions on trade concerns comparative advantage (see Nunn and Treer 2013), which governs
which products a country specializes in. In addition, trade can also a¤ect the degree of competition and mark-ups (Levinsohn 1993, Melitz and Ottaviano 2008). One idea of how trade
leads to dynamic e¤ects is that it leads to the di¤usion of technological knowledge, which affects the rate of innovation (Keller 2002). There are studies relating the extent of so-called
R&D spillovers from international trade to domestic institutions (Acharya and Keller 2008,
Coe, Helpman, and Ho¤maister 2009). Speci cally it has been argued that the introduction
of steam railways, which is taken as given, has a¤ected regional patenting in 19th century
Germany (Yin 2005, 56-57).
Along these lines we ask whether there is a relation between trade and innovation in
our context. Is patenting, a measure of innovation, related to our predicted city growth,
\ kt , capturing the impact of institutional change and railways on growth through
^ T rade(Inst)
1
trade? We do not have information on city-level patenting, however data on patenting at the
regional level is available starting in the late 19th century (Baten, Streb, and Yin 2006). Using this data, we nd that cities with greater institutional change not only had improvements
in trade during the 19th century but also exhibited systematically higher levels of per-capita
patenting in the following decades (Figure 10). Moreover, the correlation is, with almost fty
percent, quite strong. This is consistent with the hypothesis that one mechanism through which
trade led to growth in our context was higher rates of innovation.
34
Only the presence of coal deposits is a signi cant predictor of city size (+), and this does not a¤ect our
ndings on T rade and Inst: The trade coe¢cient is between around 2 to 5:5 and generally signi cant while
the institutions coe¢cient tends to be positive but not statistically signi cant, con rming our earlier ndings.

Concluding Remarks

In the setting of 19th century central Europe, we have examined the link between institutional
change as a fundamental cause of growth, and the more proximate factors, trade and railways.
Our results con rm that institutions have a strong impact on long-run growth. What is new is
that we nd trade to be important as a proximate factor in this. In this section we discuss a
number of open questions.
First, to what extent are our results driven by the setting of 19th century Germany? In
particular, should we always expect trade to be conducive to growth? Some of our estimates
point to heterogeneous e¤ects, although it is di¢cult to tell whether they could be strong enough
to lead to a core-periphery pattern (requiring positive growth in some, negative growth in other
cities). Also, in our context we did not see much evidence that trade a¤ects institutions, but we
know that trade can lead not only to inclusive changes but also to exclusive changes that lower
economic performance (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005a, Nunn 2008). It is important
to learn more about the generality of the ndings.
We have analyzed trade that, while not quite domestic, is less international than in much of
the literature. As a general matter, domestic trade may be more important than international
trade for gravity reasons: it happens more frequently. Productive coexistence almost surely
requires the division of labor on a limited geographic space, and therefore domestic trade may be
a crucial aspect of that. Trade not only depends on but may also generate another feedback to
institutions through increased trust, networks, the absence of war, and greater cultural identity.
To the extent that this is good for growth, it will be picked up as a strengthening of integration,
explaining in part why we nd trade to be so important as a proximate factor for institutions.
At the same time, there are also strong commonalities between domestic and international
trade: for example, both are subject to gravity and so-called border e¤ects (Hillberry and
Hummels 2003, Shiue 2005), and the di¤erence between domestic and international trade may
well be more gradual than the domestic versus international distinction suggests. A treatment
of institutions and culture when trade is possible over various distances, broadly de ned, can
be found in Tabellini (2008), and further work along these lines would be useful.
Taking our result that institutions a¤ect growth via trade as given, there is still much to
35

learn about the mechanisms. Was it the more credible enforcement of private contracts? A
greater tendency to establish interregional agreements? That private business interests were
given more room, including in the operation of railways? While we have arguably peeled o¤
one layer in the understanding of growth, more detailed analysis is needed combined with a
suitable framework for quanti cation to make further progress. Our analysis was limited to
one fundamental, institutions, and one proximate factor, trade. While we have considered
alternatives, a full-blown study of multiple proximate growth factors would be interesting, even
though estimating causal e¤ects would be without doubt challenging. This paper has tried to
suggest a way to include additional steps and testable implications that we hope will prove
useful in future studies of growth.

Details on Data Sources

City population We employ two measures of city population size. The rst is based on data
in the German Historical GIS Kompendium (Kunz 2013a), which gives the population at the
Regierungsbezirk level (roughly, county level) for all sample areas. For example, in the case of
Prussian cities of Madgeburg and Aachen, our estimates are based on the o¢cial population
gures for the Regierungsbezirke of Madgeburg and Aachen that were collected every three
years (in 1822, 1825, etc.). Because in each county the main city is the major inuence of
population changes, population changes derived from these gures give an accurate estimate of
city population changes.
These population trends are combined with information on population levels for the benchmark years of 1800 and 1850, which come from Bairoch, Batou, and Chevre (1988), de Vries
(1984), and Mitchell (1980) for the larger cities, and from the local population histories and
other sources for the smaller cities. The city population data for non-benchmark years for some
of the smallest towns in the sample are our own estimates. Also the city population gures for
the year 1800 come from these sources, while the population of each state in the year 1816 is
taken from Viebahn (1858).
An alternative source of population data is the Städtebuch data from Keyser (1939), various
volumes (employed in speci cation (10) of Table 10). Its primary advantage is it provides
information on the population of cities, as opposed to the counties in which the cities are
located, while its disadvantage is that population gures are given less frequently so more
interpolation is necessary. The Städtebuch gures also di¤er in that they generally include any
increase in city size due to redistricting. The two city population series are quite similar, with
a correlation above 0.99, and we are con dent that both series capture the main population
developments in the sample well.
Wheat Prices The annual price of wheat in each city is computed from government records
of market prices that were typically recorded every month, and in some cases every week. The
information on cities in Bavaria and Mecklenburg are taken from Shiue and Keller (2007), while
Seu¤ert (1857) also covers cities in Baden, Brunswick, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Cassel, Hesse45

Nassau, Saxony, and Wurttemberg. The wheat prices for Prussian markets were provided by
Michael Kopsidis, see Kopsidis (2002). In a temporal dimension, the extent of wheat price
information varies by city. We have expanded the coverage of the wheat price data using the
additional sources, in particular Fremdling and Hohorst (1979), Gerhard and Kaufhold (1990),
and Vierteljahrshefte (1935). While our sample covers virtually all German areas, Bavaria and
Mecklenburg are particularly well represented (see Figure 2). In Table 5 we show that reducing
the inuence from cities of these polities does not critically inuence our results. General
characteristics of the grain prices during this period are discussed in Shiue and Keller (2007).
The price gap sample consists of all city pairs for which we have wheat price information
for both cities. Since neither quantity nor monetary units were standardized in the German
states during the 19th century, conversion rates are required for our analysis of absolute price
di¤erences, and all prices are converted into Bavarian Gulden per Bavarian Schä¤el. The
conversion factors are taken from the original sources (see Shiue and Keller 2007 for references)
as well as from Seu¤ert (1857). Speci cally, from the latter we have (page 351):

Railway data
Direct railway connections The main source of information on the timing of railway
connections, as described in section 2.1, are the digital historical maps provided at Institut
fuer Europaeische Geschichte (IEG) in Mainz, see Kunz (2013b). At times a train connection
existed but it was highly circuitous. At other times, a train connection from a city in the
south to another in the north would rst go past the northern citys latitude before turning
back south (and analogously for east-west railway lines). In these cases there is considerable
doubt that the route was indeed the least-cost route, and we assume in these cases that train
connections in fact did not yet exist. Because of the hub-and-spoke structure of railway lines
centered on the respective state capital virtually all of these determinations are unambiguous;
our results are robust to plausible changes in the coding.

Railway cost Our measure is based on how the capacity of a 19th century steam locomotive to haul freight changes as a function of the gradient of the terrain, from Nicolls (1878).
Speci cally, Nicolls provides the following information on page 82:

capacity (tons)
Five feet to the mile is a gradient of about 0.095%, and 180 feet to the mile is a gradient
of about 3.4%. The data is for a "good" locomotive weighing 27 tons, going at a speed of 8
to 12 miles per hour, uphill. We do not know of comparable data for going downhill, and it
is assumed that the freight capacity of locomotives varied for downhill trips (due to strains on
the brakes, etc.) in the same way as it did for uphill trips.
47

To convert this into a cost measure, we assume that on at terrain the locomotive can haul
1,200 tons at the speed of 8 to 12 miles per hour. Then, the cost in terms of foregone freight
hauling capacity of a gradient of ve feet to the mile is 50 tons (1; 200

1; 150), the cost of a

gradient of ten feet to the mile is 261 tons, and so on. We t a logarithmic function through
this data to be able to work with any terrain gradient; this yields an R-squared of 0.98. With
this cost function in hand we use a 90 meter x 90 meter GIS map of the relevant area in central
Europe and the ArcGIS least-cost distance solver to compute the least-cost routes, as well as
the associated costs of those routes, from each city to all other cities in the sample. Lakes
are blocked out in this calculation, but not rivers. Because these railway costs are positively
related to the bilateral distance between cities j and k; we divide by the bilateral geographic
distance to arrive at R_costjk ; the gradient cost of terrain between j and k in terms of foregone
railway freight capacity, per unit of direct distance. All geographic distances in this paper are
computed using the Haversine formula. Summary statistics for this railway cost data is given
in Table 1B.

Institutional Change and French Rule The data on institutional change in the forty
German cities is based on Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and Robinson (ACJR; 2011). To
the extent that our analysis covers areas that are not included in their sample, we use the
sources given in ACJR, especially Dipper (1980). We de ne institutions at the city level as the
institutions that prevailed in the geographic area of the city. Note that while for the most part
the measures of institutional changeabolition of guilds and equality before the lawvary at the
state level, for some of the larger states such as Prussia and Bavaria there is also variation at
the level of the city.
There are some di¤erences in the way we employ this data. First, we employ three indicators
of institutions: (1) abolition of guilds, (2) equality before the law, and (3) the redeemability of
feudal lands, while ACJR employ a fourth, the de jure abolition of serfdom. This indicator does
not play a big role here. Further, in our analysis we compute the average of the 0/1 indicators
that indicate the presence or absence of this aspect of the institutions, which varies over time
to the extent that the indicators vary over time. In ACJR the authors de ne their institutional
indicator as the number of years that the institutional indicators were in place by a given year
48

t. As a consequence, we capture primarily the contemporaneous e¤ect while ACJR model a
more cumulative e¤ect.
Our data on the length of French rule follows ACJR closely. The criterion for this variable
is e¤ective French rule, which is more than purely military occupation. A special case in this
respect are the former Hanse cities: Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck. In the main results, we
code these cities as not French-ruled, even though they actually were French departements from
1811 to 1814. We do so because rst, French rule was most importantly designed to enforce
the continental blockade versus England, which was not only by its nature detrimental to trade
but also just di¤erent from French rule in other parts of the sample. Second, French rule in the
Hanse cities was more tenuous than in other areas; during part of the year 1812, for example,
Hamburg was ruled by the Russians. We also show in Table 10 that the main results do not
depend on our treatment of the Hanse cities (column (9)).
See Table D for the de nitions and sources of other data employed in this paper.

B

Two-sample Instrumental variables estimation

In this section we describe the two-sample instrumental variables approach. In the present case,
this means constructing a city-level average price gap variable from the predicted bilateral price
gaps of the rst stage, and employing this variable together with the institutions variable in
the city-level population regression.
Let the rst stage regression be given by

P _gapjkt =

where T radejkt , F rench_rulejk ; and R_costjk are, as before, de ned as the absolute value of
the percentage price gap between city j and city k in year t; the log average length of French
rule in cities j and k plus 1, and the bilateral railway cost between j and k; respectively.
The term Q includes the bilateral distance terms between j and k interacted with time window

analysis. The estimation equation is given by

with estimation results shown in Table 9, column 1.
When we include institutions as a separate variable to this equation, we obtain

The potentially endogenous institutions variable Instkt is instrumented by the length of

Equation (18) is a standard IV estimation problem with one endogenous variable (Inst), where

the trade variable T rade(Inst;

and perform inferences based on bootstrapping over the two-sample instrumental variables
procedure. The number of bootstrap replications is set at 200. We cluster the errors at the
level of the city. Results of these estimations are shown in Tables 9, 10, and C.

Notes: Railway Cost is the average cost of terrain, on a per kilometer basis, in terms of foregone
tons of railway freight. Bilateral Distance is the direct distance between a city-pair. List's Railway
Plan is an indicator variable equal to one if there was a railway connection between the city-pair on
economist Friedrich List's 1833 plan. Zollverein Membership is the log of average distance of the
city-pair to coast relative to average distance to coast of city-pairs that are not Zollverein members
yet in that year, plus 1; see Keller and Shiue (2013). Price Gap is the absolute value of the
percentage price difference of wheat between a city-pair.

Notes: Institutions is defined as the mean of 0/1 indicators that were present in the city in a
particular year: (1) guilds were abolished, (2) equality before the law was guaranteed, and (3) it was
possible to redeem feudal lands. "Base" is (1) and (2), "Feudal Lands" is (1) and (3), and "Broad" is
(1), (2), and (3). Years of French Rule is the number of years the city was under French rule from
1793 to 1815. French Rule Y/N is an indicator variable equal to one if the city was ever under
French Rule. Distance to Paris is the direct distance from the city to Paris, a measure of the
probability of French occupation. Protestant Share is the time varying share of protestants in the city.
Gymnasium is a school that prepares for study at universities. Coastal is an indicator variable equal
to 1 if the city is in the first quartile of distance to the coast. Waterway is an indicator variable equal
to one if the city is on a river, coast or canal in 1850 according to Kunz (2014). Coal Producer is an
indicator variable equal to one if the city had coal production in 1850. 1848 Revolution is an
indicator equal to one if the city was experiencing 1848 revolutionary activities and War is an
indicator equal to one if the city was experiencing a war.

Notes: Dependent variable is absolute value of percentage price gap between j and k; estimation method: least squares (1) to
(3), quantile regression (4) and (5), and robust regression (6) using STATA's rreg routine. ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.05,
+ p-value < 0.1. Standard errors shown in parentheses. Robust standard errors clustered at the city-pair level (1) to (3); robust
standard errors with bootstrapped confidence intervals not imposing normality (4) to (5). All regressions include year - and
city-pair fixed effects. Railway Cost as defined in the text. French Rule is log(mean years french rule in the city pair +1).
Bilateral distance is the direct distance between the two cities. French Rule Y/N is an indicator variable equal to 1 if either city
was ever under French rule.

Likelihood of Trade

Notes: Dependent variable is absolute value of percentage price gap between j and k; estimation by robust regression; standard errors in parentheses. ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.05, + pvalue < 0.1. All regressions include year- and city-pair fixed effects. Railway Cost as defined in the text. French Rule is log(mean years french rule in the city pair +1). Bilateral distance is the
bilateral distance between the two cities. List RR Plan is whether the city pair was on List's Railways Map (see Figure 4). Coal is the city-pair average of a dummy for whether each city had
coal production in 1850. Latitude and Longitude are the mean latitude and longitude of the city pair. Protestant is the mean protestant share in the city pair. Schooling is whether both cities had
a Gymnasium by the year 1580. Distance to Paris is the mean distance to Paris of the city pair, yxxs_X are scaled by 100. Waterway takes the city-pair average for a dummy of whether the city
lies on a river, coast or canal in 1850 according to Kunz (2014). Coastal is an indicator equal to 1 if both cities are within the first quartile of distance to the nearest coast and the US price of
wheat is below the median. The additional x's (col 2-10) are interacted with decade, 1820s, 30s, 40s, and 50s to allow time-varying impact.

Notes: Dependent variable in column 1 is Institutions--Base as defined in Table 1B; dependent variable in colums 2 to 10 is a 0/1 variable for whether there is a railway
connection between the two cities in that year; estimation by least squares. ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.05, + p-value < 0.1. Robust standard errors clustered by city-pair
in parentheses. All regressions include year- and city-pair fixed effects. Bilateral distance is the bilateral distance between the two cities. Distance to Paris is the mean
distance to Paris of the city pair. Protestant is the mean protestant share in the city pair. Waterway takes the city-pair average for an indicator of whether each city lies on a
navigable river, canal, or the coast in 1850 according to Kunz (2014).

Notes: Dependent Variable is absolute value of percentage price gap; estimation method is Hansen et al.'s (1996) GMM limited information maximum
likelihood estimator; ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.05, + p-value < 0.1 robust standard errors clustered by city-pair in parentheses, except column
(1A) which clusters by city. All regressions include year- and city-pair fixed effects. "State Pop'n weight" weighs each observation at the average of the
1816 state population of the city-pair. "City Pop'n weight" weighs each obs at the average of the 1800 population of the city-pair. "Bavaria" reduces the
representation of Bavaria in the sample: the weight of each observation containing a Bavarian city is reduced such that the total sum of regression
weights is 10% lower than in (3); "Mecklenburg" reduces analogously the representation of Mecklenburg cities in the base sample.

Notes: Dependent variable is the absolute value of percentage price gap between j and k; estimation is by Hansen et al.'s (1996) GMM limited informational maximum likelihood estimator; ** p-value < 0.01, * pvalue < 0.05, + p-value < 0.1 robust standard errors clustered by city pair in parentheses. All regressions include year- and city-pair fixed effects. Bilateral distance is the bilateral distance between the two cities.
Institutions measure is "Feudal Lands" in (1), "Broad" in (2) to (5) and (10), and "Base" in (6) to (9), see Table 1B for definitions. French Rule Y/N is a dummy equal to 1 if either city was ever under French rule.
Hanse treats French rule in the cities of Hamburg, Bremen and Luebeck as in all other cities, even though the Hanse is a special case. Zollverein is the log average distance of a city-pair to the closest seabord,
relative to other city pairs that were not part of the Zollverein in that year, plus 1. 1848 Rev is the mean across the city-pair of an indicator for whether the city experienced 1848 revolutionary activity. War is the
mean across the city-pair of an indicator for the times when each city was experiencing wars. Likelihood of Trade doubles regression weight for cities located on waterways. "No State Capitals" drops all city-pairs
where both cities are state capitals.

Notes: Dependent variable is log city population; estimation method is robust regression; ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.05, + p-value < 0.1; standard errors in parentheses. All
regressions include year- and city fixed effects. Railway Cost as defined in the text. French Rule is log(years french rule +1). Bilateral distance is the average distance between
the city and all others in the sample. Coal is a 0/1 variable for whether the city had coal production in 1850. Protestant is the mean protestant share in the city. Schooling is
whether the city had a Gymnasium by 1580. Waterway is a 0/1 variable for whether the city is on a navigable river, canal, or the coast according to Kunz (2014). Distance to Paris
is the direct distance to Paris, yxxs_X are scaled by 100. Coastal is a 0/1 variable for the city to be in the first quartile of distance to the coast and the US price of wheat low. The
additional x's (columns (2) to (10)) are interacted with decade, 1820s, 30s, 40s, and 50s to allow time-varying impact.

Notes: Dependent variable is log city population; results from two-sample instrumental variables estimation as described in the text, using
Hansen et al.'s (1996) GMM limited information maximum likelihood in columns (3) to (8); least squares in (1) and (2). Bootstrapped pvalues from one-sided t-tests with clustering at the city level in brackets (200 replications), except in column 5 which uses robust p-values
based on city-clustering. ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.05, + p-value < 0.10. All regressions include bilateral distance interacted with
twenty-year windows. All regressions include year- and city-pair fixed effects (with price gap as dependent variable), or year- and city fixed
effects (with city size as dependent variable). The first stage F-stat for Institutions is the Angrist-Pischke multivariate F test of excluded
instruments from a regression at the city level, taking the predicted price gaps as given. The first stage F-stat for Trade comes from the citypair analysis. Column (2) and (4) use median regression in the trade first stage. Institutions measure is "Base" except "Feudal Lands" in (6)
and "Broad" in columns (7) and (8); see Table 1B for definitions.

Notes: Dependent variable is log city population; Results from two-sample IV estimation as described in the text, using Hansen et al.'s (1996) GMM limited information maximum likelihood.
Bootstrapped p-values from one-sided t-tests with clustering at the city level in brackets; ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.05, + p-value < 0.1. All regressions include year- and city pair fixed effects
(with price gap as dependent variable), or year- and city fixed effects (with city size as dependent variable). Institutions variable "Base" except in (4), (8), and (9) where the institutions variable is
"Broad", see Table 1B for definitions. All regressions include bilateral distance interacted with time period. "State Pop'n weight" weighs each observation at the state's 1816 population. "City Pop'n
weight" weighs each observation at the city's 1800 population. Zollverein Member is the log of distance to the nearest coast relative to other cities that were not Zollverein members in that year,
plus 1; see Keller and Shiue (2013). 1848 Revolution is an indicator for whether the city experienced 1848 revolutionary activity. War is an indicator for whether the city was experiencing wars.
No State Capitals drops all cities that were state capitals. Hanse treats French rule in the cities of Hamburg, Bremen and Luebeck as in all other cities, even though the Hanse is a special case (see
text). Re-districting is based on an alternative dependent variable where city size incorporates re-districting, in part due to migration.

Notes: Dependent variable is the absolute value of percentage price gap between j and k; estimation by Hansen et al.'s (1996) GMM limited information maximum likelihood estimator; ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value
< 0.05, + p-value < 0.1; robust standard errors with clustering at the city-pair level in parentheses. All regressions include year- and city-pair fixed effects. Bilateral distance is the distance between the two cities in
the pair. List RR Plan is whether the city pair was on List's Rail Map (see Figure 4). Coal is the city-pair average of a dummy for whether the city had coal production in 1850. Latitude and Longitude are the mean
latitude and longitude of the city pair. Latitude' and Longitude' reduces regression weight of observations to one half if they are not both above median, or both below median. Protestant is the mean protestant share
in the city pair. Schooling is whether both cities had a Gymnasium by 1580. Distance to Paris is the mean distance to Paris of the city pair, yxxs_X are scaled by 100. Waterway takes the city-pair average for an
indicator of whether the city lies on a navigable river, canal, or the coast in 1850 according to Kunz (2014). Coastal is an indicator equal to 1 if both cities are within the first quartile of distance to the coast and the
US price of wheat is below the median. The additional x's (col 2-10) are interacted with decade, 1820s, 30s, 40s, and 50s to allow time-varying impact.

Notes: Dependent variable is the institutions variable "Institutions--Base", see Table 1B for definition; estimation by least squares; ** p-value < 0.01, * p-value < 0.05, + p-value <
0.1. bootstrapped p-values based on clustering at the city level (except column 6 where the number of clusters is insufficient) from a one-tailed t-test in brackets. All regressions
include year- and city-pair (when price gap is the dependent variable), or year- and city fixed effects (when city size is the dependent variable). All regressions take the predicted
price gap from the city-pair first stage using the baseline sample. French Rule is log(mean years french rule in the city pair +1). Bilateral distance is the average distance between the
city and all others in the sample. No Coal are cities that had no coal production in 1850. Waterway is an indicator of whether the city lies on a navigable river, canal, or on the coast in
1850 according to Kunz (2014). Protestant is the mean protestant share in the city.

Notes: Dependent variable is log city population; results from two-sample instrumental variables estimation as described in the text, using Hansen et al.'s (1996) GMM limited
information maximum likelihood estimator. Bootstrapped p-values based on a one-sided test with city-level clustering in brackets (200 replications); ** p-value < 0.01, * pvalue < 0.05, + p-value < 0.1. All regressions include year- and city-pair fixed effects (when the dependent variable is price gap), or year- and city fixed effects (when the
dependent variable is city size). Coal is a 0/1 variable indicating coal production near the city in 1850. Protestant is the mean protestant share in the city. Schooling is whether
the city had a Gymnasium by 1580. Waterway is a 0/1 variable for whether the city is on a navigable river, canal, or on the coast in 1850 according to Kunz (2014). Coastal is
an indicator equal to one if the city is in the first quartile of distance to the nearest coast and the US price of wheat is below the median. The additional x's (col 2-10) are
interacted with decade, 1820s, 30s, 40s, and 50s to allow time-varying impact.

An indicator equal to one if the city is in an area that was experiencing a major war; Hamburg and Luebeck
were affected by the First (1848-51) and Second (1864) Schleswig War. The Austro-Prussian War (1866) and
the Franco-Pruissian War affected all cities and is captured by year fixed effects**

*When city level variables are used in city-pair analysis, the variable becomes the mean across the city-pair unless otherwise noted.
** No big differences in results if only cities in the eastern half (Austro-Prussian War) or Western half (Franco-Prussian War) of Germany are affected.
