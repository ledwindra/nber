Revealed Growth: A Method for Bounding the Elasticity of Demand with an Application to
Assessing the Antitrust Remedy in the Du Pont Decision

ABSTRACT
We propose a method for bounding the demand elasticity in growing, homogeneous-product
markets that requires only minimal data—market price and quantity over a time span as short as
two periods. Reminiscent of revealed-preference arguments using choices over time to bound the
shape of indifference curves, we use shifts in the equilibrium over time to bound the shape of the
demand curve under the assumption that growing demand curves do not cross. We apply the
method to assess the effectiveness of the antitrust remedy in the 1952 Du Pont decision, ordering
the incumbent manufacturers to license their patents for commercial plastics. Commentators have
suggested that the incumbents may have preserved the monopoly outcome by gaming the
licensing contracts. The upper bounds on demand elasticities that we compute are significantly
less than 1 in many post-remedy years. Such inelastic demand is inconsistent with monopoly,
suggesting the remedy may have been effective.

1. Introduction
Whether structural remedies for antitrust violations are effective in fostering competition has been
an ongoing concern for scholars and policymakers. An early advocate of structural remedies,
Adams (1951) documented a series of earlier antitrust cases that the agencies won but imposed
remedies too weak to restore competition, the so-called pyrrhic victories of antitrust.
To understand why promising remedies might fail to achieve their goals, consider the Du Pont
decision of 1952, which compelled the incumbent manufacturers in the commercial plastics market to license their manufacturing patents to all applicants. As Areeda, Kaplow, and Edlin (2013)
note, remedies do not typically set the licensing terms, leaving them subject to commercial negotiation. This raises the opportunity for incumbent manufacturers to preserve something close to
the monopoly outcome by specifying exorbitant fees. Even if incumbents set fees that are deemed
“reasonable,” they can withhold the tacit knowledge necessary for entrants to compete effectively
against them.
In this paper, we study the effectiveness of the antitrust remedy ordered in the aforementioned
Du Pont decision. The case involved two incumbent chemical manufacturers: the U.S. firm Du
Pont and the U.K. firm Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). The two firms signed a Patents and
Processes agreement in 1929, granting each company exclusive licenses for the patents and secret
processes controlled by the other and dividing the global market into exclusive territories between
them. The U.S. government brought suit under the Sherman Act, alleging an illegal market division. The judge ruled in favor of the government, ordering the defendants to cancel their exclusiveterritory arrangements, requiring them to license the patents behind several of their products, most
significantly, two types of plastic widely used for commercial purposes: low-density polyethylene
(used to make Tupperware food-storage containers) and high-density polyethylene (used to make
Hula Hoops).
The remedy ostensibly had the desired procompetitive effect: eleven manufacturers entered by
the end of the decade; prices steadily declined and output rose (Backman 1964, p. 71). However,
the same price declines and output increases may have arisen in a monopoly market experiencing
substantial cost declines, plausibly true for plastics in the 1950s and 60s. The entrants may merely
have produced their share of the monopoly quantity, returning most of the rents to the incumbents.
Our study will provide formal evidence for the effectiveness of the remedy that cuts through
1

these criticisms. Formal study is hindered by a paucity of historical data, just yearly aggregate
price and quantity data for polyethylene, only available for post-remedy years. We offer a new
method that allows solid conclusions to be drawn from these fairly minimal data. The method
bounds the demand elasticity for a homogeneous product in a given year based on the assumption
that demand is growing, sandwiching the demand curve in the given year between the demand
curves in earlier and later periods.
Figure 1 provides some intuition for how the method works. In the example in the figure,
the researcher has price and quantity data for two years. The equilibrium point in the first year
is e1 and in the second is, say, e2 . The researcher wants to bound the slope the period-1 inverse
demand curve through e 1 . With so little data, there may be little hope to say anything more than
inverse demand lies somewhere between the horizontal dotted line, corresponding to an infinitely
elastic demand curve, and the dotted vertical line, corresponding to an infinitely inelastic one.
But in fact we can say more. Positing a functional form for demand, say linear, and assuming
demand is nondecreasing over time, a curve like D can be ruled out because that would put the
later equilibrium point e 2 on a lower demand curve. The demand curve through e 1 must be at least
as steep as the line connecting e1 and e2 —the line labeled D —to preserve nondecreasing demand.
The comparison of the two equilibrium points leads to a lower bound on the steepness of inverse
demand, which translates into an upper bound on the elasticity of demand through e 1 .
The tightness of the bound is data-driven. Suppose that the observed equilibrium point in
period 2 is e2 rather than e2 . This leads to a tighter bound on the elasticity. The inverse demand
through e1 must be at least as steep as D to keep e2 from lying on a lower demand curve. The
demand curve is funneled from the entire shaded region down into just the dark-shaded part, only
leaving room for a relatively inelastic demand. A researcher who finds that demand is as inelastic
as D may be able to rule out monopoly. Intuitively, the drop from e 1 to a point like e2 may be
so steep that a monopolist would never have dropped price this much for such a small increase
in quantity, even if marginal costs had dropped to zero. The more likely conclusion may be that
competitive pressure drove the firms onto the inelastic region of demand.
The example in Figure 1 implicitly assumes that demand is linear, at least locally. We develop
variants of the methodology that can narrow the bounds on the demand elasticity considerably if the
researcher is willing to assume that demand is globally linear, from the vertical to the horizontal

intercept. The variants incorporate information from the intercepts of other year’s demands to
iteratively narrow the bounds on the elasticity in a given year. Our methods generalize beyond the
linear case. We redo the analysis for another widely assumed functional form, logit demand, and
show in the application that the elasticity bounds are often virtually identical to those assuming
linear demand. The methodology section provides general formulas allowing any functional form
that the researcher chooses to be imposed.
Bounding methodologies that seem initially promising may turn out to produce such wide
bounds as to be uninformative. In our application to the polyethylene market, however, the upper
bound on the demand elasticity is substantially and statistically significantly below 1 in many sample years. The bounds are robust to alternative products, functional forms, and method variants.
Such inelastic demand is inconsistent with monopoly, suggesting the remedy may have been effective. Thus our formal evidence lends support to the use of structural remedies in monopolization
cases.
Our work is related to several literatures. One is the literature assessing the effectiveness of
structural remedies for antitrust. In addition to the aforementioned, pioneering study by Adams
(1951), studies by the U.S Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff allso make important contributions to the literature. These studies include U.S. Federal Trade Commission (1999), examining the

3

efficacy of divestiture remedies accompanying merger approvals from 1990–94; Farrell, Pautler,
and Vita (2009), describing a similar FTC exercise focusing on a sample of hospital mergers; and
U.S. Federal Trade Commission (2017), studying all 89 FTC merger orders from 2006–12. This
last study judged remedies to be at least a qualified success in 83% of cases.
We also contribute to the industrial-organization literature following Manski (1995) that seeks
to bound rather than point-estimate elasticities and other parameters. Haile and Tamer (2003) derive bounds for bids and reserve prices in their incomplete model of English auctions. Ciliberto and
Tamer (2009) identify parameter sets in the presence of multiple equilibria, applying their method
to an entry game among U.S. airlines. Pakes (2010) and Pakes, Porter, Ho, and Ishii (2015) develop
moment inequalities in single and multi-agent settings based on the revealed-preference argument
that an observed choice is better in expectation than alternative choices in the feasible set. Our
paper applies to a different setting and adopts a different approach—dealing with aggregate price
and quantity data in a homogeneous-product market rather than microdata from a differentiatedproduct market. However, we share the basic idea that equilibrium observations can identify weak
inequalities among structural parameters. Rather than “revealed preference,” we label the idea
“revealed growth” in our title—the idea that, in a growing market, equilibrium points must lie on
higher demand curves over time, which can be used to bound demand elasticities.
Our paper is also related to the literature on patent licensing. The most germane papers in this
vast literature are those regarding patent pools and those using historical evidence to shed light
on contemporary issues in intellectual property. Stocking and Watkins (1946) were the first to
formally identify the Patents and Processes agreement between Du Pont and ICI as a patent pool. 1
Lerner, Strojwas and Tirole (2007) identify distinguishing features of pro-competitive patent pools.
For example, independent licensing is more likely to be allowed when complementary patents are
pooled, and pooling complementary patents is more likely to be procompetitive than substitute
patents. Lampe and Moser (2013) study the first U.S. patent pool, formed in 1856 involving
sewing machines. Perhaps the closest paper in this literature is Watzinger, Fackler, Nagler and
Schnitzer (2017), who examine induced innovation in the context of the 1956 Bell System consent
1 The

formation of a patent pool was hardly exceptional during that period, as Tirole (2014) notes in his Nobel
lecture: “A little known fact is that, prior to 1945, most high-tech industries of the time were run by patent pools. But
the worry about cartelization through joint marketing led to a hostile decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1945 and
the disappearance of pools until the recent revival of interest.”

decree. The United States filed a monopolization suit against Bell in 1949, alleging that it had
foreclosed entry into various related markets such as telecommunications equipment. The consent
decree allowed Bell to remain vertically integrated into telecommunications but forced it to license
its existing patents royalty-free. The authors find that, while follow-on innovation did not expand
in telecommunications equipment, it did in other sectors.
Finally, our paper is related to economic commentaries specifically on the remedy ordered
the Du Pont case. Some of the commentary is quite critical. In his classic, two-volume history,
Reader (1975, p. 417) argues that the prosecution arose out of political pressure at the Department
of Justice. Hounshell and Smith (1988, p. 206) criticize the court’s verdict for a different reason.
“Judge Ryan . . . refused to accept the argument that ICI’s and Du Pont’s agreement resulted in
the genuine exchange of scientific and technical information. But the overwhelming historical
evidence demonstrates this was indeed the case.” By contrast, we provide supporting evidence that
the licensing remedy was effective in ending the monopoly and spurring competition in plastics.
The paper is structured as follows. The first part of the paper covers methodology. Section 2
models the situation to which the methodology will be applied. Section 3 presents a method
for bounding demand elasticities incorporating local information from the pairwise comparison
of equilibria. A series of subsections treats different demand functions, from linear, to logit, to
general forms. Section 4 shows how the bounds can be tightened by iteratively incorporating
limiting information. Again, a series of subsections treats different demand functions, from linear,
to logit, to general forms. The remainder of the paper covers the empirical application to the Du
Pont decision. Section 5 provides institutional background, Section 6 describes the data, Section 7
presents results, and Section 8 discusses robustness issues. Section 9 concludes. Appendix A
provides proofs not included in the text. Online Appendix B provides supplementary figures.

2. Model
This section lays out a general model of a growing market for a homogeneous product used in the
analysis. Each period t, the interaction between producers and consumers on the market leads to an
equilibrium et ≡ (qt , pt ), where qt ≥ 0 is market quantity and pt ≥ 0 is market price. The researcher
observes the market equilibrium over some time span t ∈ {1, . . ., T }. Let E ≡ {et | t = 1, . . ., T }
denote the set of time-series observations of equilibrium.
5

The analysis can be streamlined without much loss of generality if ties between price observations or quantity observations are ruled out, accomplished by the following definition of distinctness.
Definition. E is distinct if and only if, for all et , et  ∈ E such that t = t  , we have qt  = qt  and
pt  = pt  .
Assuming E is distinct entails little loss of generality if one supposes that two observations are
never exactly equal if measured to arbitrary precision. We also assume that the market is nontrivial
in the sense of involving positive prices and quantities in each period.
Definition. E is nontrivial if and only if, for all e t ∈ E, we have qt , pt > 0.
We will characterize each side of the market in turn starting with producers. Since the goal
of our application will be to determine whether the antitrust remedy was effective in changing
producer conduct, it is natural to consider producer conduct as an unknown to be determined.
Thus, we will be fairly agnostic about producer behavior in the model. Producers may engage in
perfect competition, in which case it may be possible to characterize their behavior with a supply
curve; or they may engage in some form of imperfect competition, perhaps monopoly, whose
behavior is characterized by a supply relation derived from a first-order condition.
Next, consider the consumer side of the market. Consumers are price takers whose behavior is
captured by the demand curve q = Dt (p), the functional form of which is posited by the researcher.
Assume the functional form obeys the law of demand, i.e., that the demand curve at a given point
in time, Dt (p), is nonincreasing in p.
Assumption 1 (Law of Demand). For all t ∈ {1, . . ., T }, Dt (p ) ≥ Dt (p ) for all p > p ≥ 0.
The assumption of a growing market entails growing demand, formally that D t (p) is nondecreasing
in t.
Assumption 2 (Growing Demand). For all t  , t  ∈ {1, . . ., T } such that t  < t  , Dt  (p) ≤ Dt  (p)
for all p ≥ 0.
Not all equilibrium configurations E are consistent with growing demand. To aid the discussion
of which inconsistent configurations are ruled out, we introduce notation for subsets determined

Figure 2: Sets Determined by Compass Position

by compass directions relative to a reference equilibrium point, e t :
NW(et ) ≡ {(qt  , pt  ) ∈ E | qt  < qt , pt  > pt }
NE(et ) ≡ {(qt  , pt  ) ∈ E | qt  > qt , pt  > pt }
SE(et ) ≡ {(qt  , pt  ) ∈ E | qt  > qt , pt  < pt }

(1)

SW(et ) ≡ {(qt  , pt  ) ∈ E | qt  < qt , pt  < pt }.
Each equilibrium point divides the nonnegative quadrant into four regions corresponding to four
relative compass directions; our notation provides a label for these subregions. Figure 2 depicts
these compass sets. As the figure indicates, the axes are taken to be oriented in the usual way
when graphing inverse demand, i.e., with quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical
axis. The fact that the definitions in (1) involve strict inequalities leaves points on the dotted lines
through et in the figure unclassified, but this is without loss of generality for distinct E, which
precludes equilibrium points from sharing coordinates.
Building on the definitions in equation (1), we define subsets of the compass sets depending on
the time at which the equilibria appear. For example, define
NW − (et ) ≡ {et  ∈ NW(et ) | t  < t}
+



NW (et ) ≡ {e ∈ NW(et ) | t > t}.
t

7

(2)

In words, NW − (et ) is the subset of equilibrium points in NW(et ) that occur before et and NW +(et )
the subset that occur after et . Four compass directions and two relative times entail eight possible
combinations and thus eight possible subsets. The other six subsets—NE − (et ), NE + (et ), SE − (et ),
SE +(et ), SW − (et ), and SW +(et )—are defined by analogy to equation (2). We will call these timeaugmented compass sets.
Consider positioning a new equilibrium point e t  that occurs after et in one of the compass
sets in the figure. A downward-sloping inverse demand curve through e t (such as the solid curve
drawn in the figure) slices through regions NW(et ) and SE(et ). This leaves room to add the new
equilibrium point so that it lies on a higher demand curve—thus respecting Assumption 2 that
demand is growing—yet still falls in NW + (et ) or SE + (et ). The new equilibrium could also easily
be added in NE + (et ) as well, placed on a higher inverse demand in that region. However, there
is no way to add the new equilibrium point to SW + (et ) without having it lie on a lower demand
curve. Thus, in a market with growing demand, SW + (et ) must be empty for all et ∈ E.
When E has the property that SW + (et ) is empty for all et ∈ E, we will say that E exhibits
rectangular expansion because equilibrium points occurring after the reference one e t lie outside
the rectangle determined by et and the origin at opposite corners.
Definition. E exhibits rectangular expansion if and only if SW + (et ) is empty for all et ∈ E.
With this definition in hand, we can encapsulate the analysis from the previous paragraph leads
with the following proposition.
Proposition 1. Assumption 2 that demand is growing implies that E exhibits rectangular expansion.
Switching perspectives from demand growing as we advance into the future to demand shrinking as we delve into the past, the fact that SW +(et ) is empty for all et ∈ E is equivalent to NE −(et )
being empty for all et ∈ E. Hence an equivalent condition for E exhibiting rectangular expansion is
that NE − (et ) is empty for all et ∈ E. Yet another equivalent condition for E exhibiting rectangular
expansion is that for all et  , et  ∈ E such that t  < t  , either qt  ≤ qt  or pt  ≤ pt  . That is, E exhibits
rectangular expansion if price, quantity, or both grows each period.

3. Method Incorporating Local Information
We begin with our simplest method for bounding demand elasticities. We will refer to this method
as incorporating local information because it uses the location of other equilibrium points e t  to
constrain the position of the demand curve through a given equilibrium point e t . This stands in
contrast with a method introduced later that uses limits of demand curves through other equilibrium
points to constrain the position of the demand curve through e t . We will refer to this later method
as incorporating limiting information.
Whether incorporating local or limiting information, all of our methods require the researcher
to impose a functional-form assumption on demand. The first subsection analyzes the simple and
widely used assumption of linear demand. The next subsection analyzes logit demand. The last
subsection extends the methods to general demand functions.

3.1. Linear Demand
Suppose the research imposes the assumption that the sequence of demand curves over time is
linear: Dt (p) = at − bt p for t = 1, . . ., T . Note that the parameters at and bt are subscripted by t
and thus allowed to vary over time, in turn allowing the demand curve to shift over time.
This specification of demand involves two independent parameters, but further requiring the
line to pass through the equilibrium point e t pins it down to a single-parameter family. Focus for
now on the slope, bt , as the key parameter. Letting D̃(p, bt , et ) be the linear demand with slope bt
through equilibrium point e t = (pt , qt ), we have
Dt (p) = D̃(p, bt , et ) = qt + bt (pt − p).

(3)

The law of demand (Assumption 1) holds if and only if b t ≥ 0.
With knowledge of the slope bt and equilibrium point et , one can solve for the demand intercept,
at = qt + bt pt ,

or for the absolute value of the demand elasticity,
t ≡ −D̃ p (pt , bt , et )

pt bt pt
=

qt
qt

(5)

where D̃ p denotes the partial derivative of the demand function with respect to its first argument.
Note that bt ≥ 0 implies t ≥ 0. For brevity, we will drop the “absolute value” modifier and simply
call t the demand elasticity.
We will derive bounds on demand slope bt via pairwise comparisons of that period’s equilibrium point et with the location of the other equilibrium points. Using equation (5), bounds on b t
can then be translated into the desired bounds on t .
Before proceeding with the formal analysis, we provide some intuition on how the method
works using Figure 3. Each panel compares a reference equilibrium point e t to another equilibrium
point et  . Without further information, all we know is that the linear inverse demand through e t
must be somewhere between the perfectly horizontal and perfectly vertical ones delineated by the
dotted lines. What further information the comparison to e t  can provide depends on which of
the eight time-augmented compass subsets et  falls into relative to et . By Proposition 1, two of
these sets are empty when demand is growing, leaving the six non-empty sets into which et  can
fall, corresponding to the panels in the figure: SE +(et ), NW +(et ), NE +(et ), NW −(et ), SE − (et ), and
SW − (et ).
In Panel A, et  ∈ SE +(et ). Drawing a line connecting et and et  , we know that the inverse
demand through et cannot be less steep than that; otherwise et  would be forced to lie on a lower
demand curve, violating Assumption 2 that demand is growing over time since t  > t as et  ∈
SW + (et ). The line connecting et and et  thus provides a lower bound on the steepness of the
inverse demand through et , allowing us to to narrow the location of the inverse demand curve from
somewhere between the dotted lines down into the shaded funnel. Recalling that bt measures the
steepness of the direct (i.e., non-inverse) demand, the lower bound on the steepness of the inverse
demand translates into an upper bound on bt .
In Panel B, et  ∈ NW + (et ). With this compass orientation for et  , the line connecting et and et 
provides an upper bound on the steepness of the inverse demand through e t ; any steeper and et 
would be forced to lie on a lower demand curve, violating Assumption 2. The upper bound on

steepness of inverse demand translates into a lower bound on bt . In Panel C, et  ∈ NE +(et ). In this
case, regardless of which inverse demand between the dotted lines we draw through et , it is always
possible to place et  on a higher demand curve. So in this case the pairwise comparison provides
no further information to narrow down the location of the inverse demand through e t .
Panels C–F illustrate cases in which et  occurs before et , so et  falls into the time-augmented
compass sets with minus rather than plus superscripts. Examining each panel, the reader can verify
that the bounds are the same as in Panels A–C except that they apply to the opposite compass
direction. Thus, et  ∈ NW −(et ) generates an upper bound on bt , et  ∈ SE − (et ) generates a lower
bound, and et  ∈ SW − (et ) provides no information.
To proceed with the formal analysis, first suppose t  > t. Then
D̃(p, bt , et ) = Dt (p) ≤ Dt  (p) = D̃(p, bt  , et  ),

(6)

where the equalities follow from (3) and the inequality from Assumption 2 of growing demand.
Since (6) holds for all p ≥ 0, it must hold in particular for p t  . Substituting pt  into (6) yields
qt + bt (pt − pt  ) = D̃(pt  , bt , et ) ≤ D̃(pt  , bt  , et  ) = qt  , or rearranging,
bt (pt − pt  ) ≤ qt  − qt .

(7)

The bounds on bt that can be derived from equation (7) depend on the compass position of
et  relative to et . There are three subcases to consider depending on whether et  is in NW + (et ),
NE + (et ), or SE +(et ); the subcase in which et  ∈ SW +(et ) can be ignored when demand is growing
since SW + (et ) is empty by Proposition 1. To streamline the analysis, let B(et , et  ) denote the
absolute value of the slope of the linear demand through points e t and et  :


 qt  − qt 
.
B(et , et  ) ≡ 
pt  − pt 

(8)

Suppose et  ∈ NW + (et ). Cross multiplying (7) by pt − pt  yields
bt ≥

qt  − qt
= B(et , et  ).
pt − pt 

12

(9)

The first step follows from et  ∈ NW + (et ), which implies pt < pt  by (1). The second step follows
because the numerator and denominator of the middle fraction are both negative for e t  ∈ NW + (et ).
Condition (9) provides a lower bound on the demand slope.
Next, suppose et  ∈ NE +(et ). Cross multiplying (7) by pt − pt  yields
bt ≥

qt  − qt
.
pt − pt 

(10)

The right-hand is negative since the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative for
et  ∈ NE + (et ). Hence, (10) is a weaker condition than the maintained assumption bt ≥ 0. Thus this
case contributes no useful information to bound b t .
Next, suppose et  ∈ SE +(et ). Cross multiplying (7) by pt − pt  yields
bt ≤

qt  − qt
= B(et , et  ).
pt − pt 

(11)

Cross multiplying did not change the direction of the inequality because p t > pt  for et  ∈ SE + (et ).
The second step follows because both numerator and denominator of the middle fraction are positive for et  ∈ SE + (et ). Condition (11) provides an upper bound on the demand slope.
The pairwise comparison of et and et  can be repeated for t  < t. Sparing the details, using
analysis similar to that above, one can show bt ≤ B(et , et  ) when et  ∈ NW − (et ), bt ≥ B(et , et  )
when et  ∈ SE −(et ), and no useful information is contributed when e t  ∈ SW − (et ). We have proved
the following proposition.
Proposition 2. Suppose the sequence of linear demands D̃(p, bt , et ) defined in (3) satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2. Then bt ∈ [bt , b̄t ] for all t ∈ {1, . . ., T }, where

A few technical notes about Proposition 2 are in order. The ∨ operator denotes the join; i.e.,
x ∨ y denotes the maximum of x and y. The use of this operator in (12) indicates the imposition
of a floor of 0 on top of the supremum. We will use this operator repeatedly later as well as ∧ for
the meet; i.e., x ∧ y denotes the minimum of x and y. The supremum is taken in (12) rather than
the maximum and the infimum in (13) rather than the minimum even though the sets involved are

discrete so that the possibility that one of these sets is empty can be accommodated. An empty
set does not have a maximum or minimum but does have a supremum and infimum; we use the
conventional definitions inf 0/ = ∞ and sup 0/ = −∞. If the set SW − (et ) ∪ NW +(et ) over which the
supremum is taken in (12) is nonempty, then imposing a 0 floor on the supremum is superfluous
because B(et , et  ) is defined to be an absolute value. However, if the set over which the supremum
is taken happens to be empty, then bt = −∞ without the imposition of the 0 floor.
¯
Proposition 2 prescribes the following simple algorithm for bounding b t .2 The lower bound
bt is found by pairing et with each of the equilibrium points in SW − (et ) and NW + (et ), drawing
¯
linear demands connecting them, and identifying which is steepest (note, we are here referring to
the steepness of the direct, not inverse, demand). The steepness of the identified line gives bt . If
¯
both SW −(et ) and NW + (et ) are empty, we set bt to respect the non-negativity constraint on b t ; i.e.,
¯
bt = 0. The upper bound b̄t is found by pairing et with each of the equilibrium points in NW −(et )
¯
and SE +(et ), drawing linear demands connecting them, and identifying which is the least steep.
The steepness of the identified line gives b̄t . If both NW −(et ) and SE + (et ) are empty, by (13) we
have b̄t = inf 0/ = ∞. The bounds on bt can be translated into bounds on t using (5): i.e., t ∈ [t ,¯t ],
¯
where t ≡ bt pt /qt and ¯t ≡ b̄t pt /qt .

Figure 4 provides a simple example of the use of the algorithm. To bound the elasticity  1 of

equilibrium points are drawn. The steeper of the two, 13 , provides the a lower bound on the
steepness of the inverse demand curve through e1 , which translates into an upper bound b̄1 on the
steepness demand given in Proposition 2 and an upper bound ¯ 1 on the demand elasticity. Because
SE −(e1 ) and NW +(e1 ) are empty, pairwise comparisons do not yield a lower bound 1 on the
¯
elasticity in this example (apart from 0 derived from non-negativity).

3.2. Logit Demand
Instead of imposing linear demand, the researcher may choose to impose logit demand, microfounded by McFadden (1973), widely used in structural estimation of differentiated-product demand following Berry, Levinsohn, Pakes (1995). In the context of a homogeneous product market
under study, logit demand can be specified as
Dt (p) =

nt exp(−αt p)
nt
=
,
1 + exp(−αt p) 1 + exp(αt p)

(14)

where nt is interpreted as a market-size parameter and αt as a price-sensitivity parameter. For
demand to be nonnegative, nt ≥ 0; for the law of demand (Assumption 1) to hold, α t ≥ 0.
This specification of demand involves two independent parameters, but further requiring the
curve to pass through the equilibrium point e t pins it down to a single-parameter family. Focus
for now on price sensitivity, αt , as this key parameter. Given αt and equilibrium point (qt , pt ),
equation (14) can be solved for the market-size parameter:
nt = qt [1 + exp(αt pt )].

(15)

Substituting for nt from equation (15) into (14) yields an expression for logit demand in terms of
the single unknown parameter αt and known equilibrium point et = (qt , pt ):
D̃(p, αt , et ) =

qt [1 + exp(αt pt )]
.
1 + exp(αt p)

(16)

pt
αt pt
=
.
qt
1 + exp(−αt pt )

(17)

The elasticity of logit demand is
t = −D̃ p (pt , αt , et )

15

As in the linear-demand case, here in the logit-demand case here we will derive bounds on the
price-sensitivity parameter (αt ) from the pairwise comparison of reference equilibrium point e t to
other equilibrium points et  . Bounds on αt can then be translated into bounds on t via equation
(17).
Suppose t < t  . To respect Assumption 2 of growing demand, for all p ≥ 0 we must have
D̃(p, αt , et ) = Dt (p) ≤ Dt  (p) = D̃(p, αt  , et  ). The preceding inequality must hold in particular for
p = pt  , implying
qt [1 + exp(αt pt )]
= D̃(pt  , αt , et ) ≤ D̃(pt  , αt  , et  ) = qt  ,
1 + exp(αt pt  )

(18)

qt [1 + exp(αt pt )] ≤ qt  [1 + exp(αt pt  )].

(19)

or rearranging,

Let A(et , et  ) be the solution to the previous expression treated as an equality, i.e., the value of
α ≥ 0 solving
qt [1 + exp(αpt )] = qt  [1 + exp(αpt  )].

(20)

One can show—as done in the proof of the next proposition—that if e t  ∈ NW +(et ), then A(et , et  )
exists, is unique, and provides a lower bound on the αt satisfying (19). One can further show that
if et  ∈ SE +(et ), A(et , et  ) exists, is unique, and provides an upper bound on the αt satisfying (19).
If et  ∈ NE +(et ), then (20) has no solution over α ≥ 0 since (19) is satisfied as a strict inequality for
all αt ≥ 0. In this case, pairwise comparison of et and et  yields no bounding information. The case
in which et  ∈ SW +(et ) can be ignored because the set is empty under Assumption 2 of growing
demand.
The pairwise comparison of et and et  can be repeated for t  < t. Growing demand then implies
the same inequality as (18) with the direction reversed, leading to the same bound but for the
opposite compass direction. For details, see the proof of the following proposition, provided in the
appendix.
Proposition 3. Suppose the sequence of logit demands D̃(p, αt , et ) defined in (16) satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2. Then αt ∈ [αt , ᾱt ] for all t ∈ {1, . . ., T }, where

(22)

Proposition 3 prescribes the following algorithm for bounding α t . To obtain the lower bound αt ,
¯
pair et with each of the equilibrium points in SW −(et ) and NW + (et ), compute A(et , et  ) for each pair
by solving the nonlinear equation (20). Equation (20) is well-behaved and can be rapidly solved by
a grid search, Newton-Raphson, or other standard methods. The largest of these solutions A(et , et  )
is taken as αt . If both SW − (et ) and NW + (et ) are empty, we set αt to respect the non-negativity
¯
¯
constraint on αt ; i.e., αt = 0. To obtain the upper bound ᾱt , pair et with each of the equilibrium
¯
points in NW −(et ) and SE + (et ), compute α(et , et  ) for each pair by solving the nonlinear equation
(20). The smallest of these solutions A(et , et  ) becomes ᾱt . If both NW −(et ) and SE + (et ) are empty,
the formula (22) yields ᾱt = inf 0/ = ∞, correctly implying we obtain no upper bound in this case.
Using equation (17), the bounds on αt can be translated into bounds on t ; namely, t ∈ [t ,¯t ],

3.3. General Demand
The method for incorporating local information from pairwise equilibrium comparisons is readily
generalizable to a broad class of functional forms. Suppose the researcher specifies the form for
demand q = Dt (p). This demand curve may start out as a multiple-parameter family; but assume
that once it is required to pass through et , this pins it down to a single-parameter family indexed
by θ:
Dt (p) = D̃(p, θ, et ).

(24)

Assume D̃(p, θ, et ) is continuously differentiable of all orders in all arguments. Assume increases in θ ∈ [0, ∞) cause demand to rotate. As an accounting convention, assume that the rotation
is such that demand becomes steeper (and inverse demand less steep) when θ increases, consistent
with the effect of the price-sensitivity parameter α in the logit case. Thus
D̃θ (p, θ, et ) < 0

if p > pt

D̃θ (p, θ, et ) = 0

if p = pt

D̃θ (p, θ, et ) > 0

if p < pt ,

17

(25)

where D̃θ denotes the partial derivative of demand with respect to its second argument. We also
impose the following Inada conditions:
lim D̃(p, θ, et ) = qt

θ→0

lim D̃(p, θ, et ) =

θ→∞

⎧
⎪
⎨0
⎪
⎩∞

p > pt

(26)

(27)

p < pt .

Equation (26) implies that D̃(p, θ, et ) becomes infinity inelastic for arbitrarily small θ. Given
D̃(p, θ, et ) must pass through et , as it becomes infinitely inelastic, its inverse approaches a vertical line at quantity qt for all p ≥ 0. Equation (27) implies that D̃(p, θ, et ) becomes infinitely
elastic as θ becomes arbitrarily large. Together, (26) and (27) in effect say that the domain of θ t
is rich enough to allow changes in θ to trace out all possible demand slopes from infinitely elastic
to infinitely inelastic. We verify in the appendix that conditions (25)–(27) hold when D̃(p, θ, et )
is taken to be the logit demand defined in (16) with α playing the role of θ. Hence the general
specification nests logit demand as a special case.
As in the linear and logit cases, we write the price-sensitivity parameter with a subscript, θ t , to
emphasize that it may vary over time. Bounds on θt will be derived from the pairwise comparison
of et to other equilibrium points et  .
Start by supposing t < t  . To respect Assumption 2 of growing demand, for all p ≥ 0 we
must have D̃(p, θt , et ) = Dt (p) ≤ Dt  (p) = D̃(p, θt  , et  ). The inequality must hold in particular for
p = pt  , implying D̃(pt  , θt , et ) ≤ D̃(pt  , θt  , et  ) = qt  . Let Θ(et , et  ) be the solution to the equation
formed by treating the preceding condition as an equality, i.e., the value of θ ≥ 0 solving
D̃(pt  , θ, et ) = qt  .

(28)

Sparing the details filled in by the proof of the next proposition, Θ(e t , et  ) is the key component of
the bounds on θt for general demands, serving the same role as A(et , et  ) for logit demands.
Proposition 4. Suppose the sequence of general demands D̃(p, θt , et ) defined in (24) satisfies As-

18

sumptions 1 and 2. Then θt ∈ [θt , θ̄t ] for all t ∈ {1, . . ., T }, where

θt ≡ 0 ∨

(29)

θ̄t ≡

et  ∈ NW − (et ) ∪ SE + (et )

Θ(et , et  ).

The proof is provided in the appendix.
Proposition 4 prescribes an algorithm for bounding θ t in the case of general demands. This
algorithm is analogous to that prescribed by Proposition 3 for bounding α t in the case of logit
demand. The only difference is that instead of solving equation (20) for A(e t , et  ), the more general
equation (28) is solved for Θ(et , et  ). The algorithms are otherwise the same, including that they
involve the same time-augmented compass sets for the upper and lower bounds.
Equation (28) is a nonlinear equation in the single unknown variable θ. This equation is wellbehaved for et  in the relevant subsets contributing to the bounds in Proposition 4: the proof of the
proposition shows that for et  ∈ NW(et ) ∪ SE(et ), the left-hand side of (28) is monotonic in θ. Thus
standard methods, including a straightforward grid search, can be used to solve (28) and derive
Θ(et , et  ).
Translating the bounds on θt into bounds on the elasticity, defined in the general case as
t = −D̃ p (pt , θt , et )

pt
,
qt

(31)

requires additional work in the general case because it needs to be shown that condition (25)
implies that t is nondecreasing in θt . This is done in the proof of the following proposition,
proved in the appendix.
Proposition 5. Suppose conditions (25)–(27) hold. Then, defining

we have t ∈ [t ,¯t ].

4. Method Incorporating Limiting Information
If the researcher is willing to assume that the posited functional form applies throughout the whole
domain of the demand curve, the elasticity bounds can be tightened by exploiting information

Figure 5: Illustrating Method Incorporating Limiting Information

about the relative position of demand curves for limiting values of prices, p → 0 and p → ∞, rather
than observed prices. The analysis proceeds as in the previous subsection by analyzing a sequence
of functional forms for demand, from linear, to logit, to general.
Before delving into the technical details, we provide some intuition on how limiting information can help tighten the elasticity bounds using Figure 5. The figure revisits the simple example
introduced in Figure 4, carrying over the features from that previous figure as the solid lines. Recall the goal of that simple example was to bound the elasticity  1 of demand through equilibrium
point e1 . The method of incorporating local information from pairwise comparisons allowed us to
conclude that the inverse demand through e 1 must be at least as steep as line 13 , providing a lower
bound of the steepness of inverse demand, translating into an upper bound b̄1 on the steepness of
demand and an upper bound ¯ 1.
The new features of Figure 5, drawn as dotted lines and open circles, show how to tighten
the bound by incorporating information on the position of the limits of demand curves through
other equilibrium points. The pairwise comparison of points e 2 and e3 leads us to conclude that
the inverse demand through e3 must be as steep as line 23 for e2 not to lie on a higher demand
curve. But notice that 23 intersects 13 . Unless the inverse demand curve through e1 is steeper
than 23 , parts of the curve will lie above the curve through e 3 , violating Assumption 2 that demand
is growing. For the whole inverse demand through e 1 to be lower than the whole inverse demand
through e3 , the demand curves cannot cross even for prices approaching 0, implying in the case

20

of linear inverse demands that their horizontal intercepts cannot cross. To ensure their horizontal
intercepts do not cross, the inverse demand through e 1 must be at least as steep as the dotted line
that connects e1 with the horizontal intercept of  23 , drawn as the open circle. This new line through
e1 is even steeper than 13 , tightening the lower bound on the steepness of inverse demand, and
thus tightening the upper bound on the demand elasticity.
This is just one simple example involving three equilibrium points and linear demands. The
general method below will apply to an arbitrary number of equilibrium points and general demand
specifications. The general method will preserve the flavor of the example in that the first step
will be to compute the bounds incorporating local information, and then the second step will be to
compare the limiting positions of the bounding demand curves from the first step.
To help clarify the iterative nature of the method, some new notation is in order. Re-express the
bounds incorporating local information presented in the previous section by adding a single star to
them to indicate that these bounds constitute the first step of an iterative procedure, thus writing
bt∗ ≡ bt , b̄t∗ ≡ b̄t , αt∗ ≡ αt , ᾱ∗ ≡ ᾱt , θt∗ ≡ θt , θ̄∗ ≡ θ̄t , t∗ ≡ t , and ¯t∗ ≡ ¯t .

4.1. Linear Demand
This section provides a formal derivation of the new bounds incorporating limiting information
in the case of linear demands. We will analyze new bounds emerging from the limits p → 0 and
p → ∞ in turn. Start by considering the limit p → 0 and comparing the equilibrium points e t and
et  for t  > t. Assumption 2 of growing demand implies D̃(p, bt , et ) ≤ D̃(p, bt  , et  ) for all p ≥ 0,
implying in particular that D̃(0, bt , et ) ≤ D̃(0, bt  , et  ). Substituting from for D̃ from (3) into this
inequality, and further substituting p = 0, yields qt + bt pt ≤ qt  + bt  pt  . Notice this is a condition
on the relative position of the inverse demand curves’ horizontal intercepts. Rearranging,
bt ≤

1
1
(qt  − qt + bt  pt  ) ≤ (qt  − qt + b̄t∗ pt  ),
pt
pt

(33)

where the second inequality follows from Proposition 2. Condition (33) provides an additional
upper bound on bt incorporating information on a different equilibrium point’s upper bound b̄t∗
from the prior iteration.
Supposing instead that t  < t, we can apply the analysis from the previous paragraph, just

21

reversing the inequalities, to obtain
bt ≥

1
1
(qt  − qt + bt  pt  ) ≥ (qt  − qt + bt∗ pt  ).
¯
pt
pt

(34)

This additional lower bound incorporates information on a different equilibrium point’s lower
bound bt∗ from a prior iteration.
¯
Next, consider the limit p → ∞. Start by supposing t  > t. The fact that D̃(p, bt , et ) ≤ D̃(p, bt  , et  )
for all p ≥ 0 implies lim p→∞ D̃(p, bt , et ) ≤ lim p→∞ D̃(p, bt  , et  ). These limits are just the vertical
intercepts of the respective inverse demands. Hence, the preceding inequality implies pt + qt /bt ≤
pt  + qt  /bt  , or after rearranging,

bt

q
pt  − pt + t
bt 


≥ qt .

(35)

One can show that the factor in parentheses is always positive when t  > t and demand is growing.3
Cross multiplying by the positive factor in parentheses yields
bt ≥

qt
qt
≥
.
pt  − pt + qt  /bt 
pt  − pt + qt  /bt∗
¯

(36)

Again, we have an additional lower bound incorporating information on a different equilibrium
point’s lower bound bt∗ from the prior iteration.
¯
Supposing instead that t  < t, we can apply the preceding analysis, just reversing inequalities,
to obtain


bt

q
pt  − pt + t
bt 


≤ qt .

(37)

An important difference here is that the factor in parentheses cannot be unambiguously signed
when t  < t. When the factor in parentheses is non-positive, (37) holds for all b t . In that case,
the condition provides no useful bounding information. When the factor in parentheses is positive,
is immediate that the factor in parentheses in equation (35) is positive if p t  > pt since qt  > 0 and bt  ≥ 0.
Suppose instead that pt  < pt . Then et  ∈ SW + (et )∪ SE + (et ). Proposition 1 rules out e t  ∈ SW + (et ) under Assumption 2,
leaving et  ∈ SE + (et ). Then
q  − qt
qt 
bt  ≤ b̄t  ≤ B(et , et  ) = t
<
.
pt − pt 
pt − pt 
3 It

The first and second steps follow from Proposition 2. The next step follows from the definition of B(e t , et  ) from (8)
and from qt  > qt and pt > pt  for et  ∈ SE + (et ). The last step follows from qt > 0 for nontrivial equilibrium set E.
Cross multiplying by p t − pt  , which is positive, and rearranging proves that the term in parentheses is positive.

22

cross multiplying by it preserves the direction of the inequality, yielding
bt ≤

qt
qt
≤
.
pt  − pt + qt  /bt 
pt  − pt + qt  /b̄t∗

(38)

To emphasize, condition (38) only provides a potentially useful upper bound if the denominator of
the last fraction is positive, i.e.,
pt  +

pt 
> pt .
b̄t∗

(39)

If (39) does not hold, we must ignore (38) lest we conclude that b t is bounded above by the negative
number on the right-hand side of (38), violating the law of demand (Assumption 1), which implies
bt ≥ 0.
The bounding exercise that generated conditions (33)–(38) can be repeated comparing e t to
all the other equilibrium points e t  . If the tightest of the resulting bounds incorporating limiting
information is tighter than the corresponding bound incorporating local information, we take the
former as the new bound, indicated with two stars in the superscript. Otherwise, the new bound is
just set to the old bound. We have the following proposition.
Proposition 6. Suppose the sequence of linear demands D̃(p, bt , et ) defined in (3) satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2. Then bt ∈ [bt∗∗, b̄t∗∗] for all t ∈ {1, . . ., T }, where

Some technical remarks about the proposition are in order. Note that, as do equations (12)–
(13), (40)–(41) involve suprema and infima rather than maximums and minimums to accommodate
possibly empty sets, as will be the case when computing bounds for the first and last equilibrium
points, i.e., e1 or eT . Note also that it is conceivable that continuing the iterations could result in
yet tighter bounds, for example computing b̄t∗∗∗ by replacing b̄∗ with b̄t∗∗ on the right-hand side of
(41), and so on. We conjecture that convergence is achieved by the stage shown in (40) and (41),
so there is no gain from further iterating. 4
4 Our Stata code that implements the bounds in Proposition 6 allows continued iteration.

In the empirical application
to the Du Pont decision and all Monte Carlos we have tried, however, iterations stop at bt∗∗ and b̄t∗∗ . We have managed
¯
a general proof that iteration stops at bt∗∗ and b̄t∗∗ for many cases, but a handful of cases remain open questions.
¯

23

The bounds bt∗∗ and b̄t∗∗ incorporating limiting information are at least as tight as bt∗ and b̄t∗ .
¯
¯
This is true by definition because the latter bounds appear on the right-hand side of (40) and (41).
If the limiting information does not tighten the bounds, by default they return to the first stage that
incorporates just local information. The formulas in (40) and (41) are sufficiently complicated that
it is hard to tell whether bt∗∗ and b̄t∗∗ can ever be strictly tighter than bt∗ and b̄t∗. Figure 5, which
¯
¯
in
the
simple
example
with
those three equilibrium
we now have the language to say derives b̄∗∗

points, suggests that bt∗∗ and b̄t∗∗ can be strictly tighter than bt∗ and b̄t∗ in some cases. We will
¯
¯
indeed see that substantial tightening is possible when we turn to the empirical application to the
Du Pont decision.
Substituting the new bounds into the elasticity formula (5), we have  t ∈ [t∗∗,¯t∗∗], where t∗∗ ≡
¯
¯
bt∗∗ pt /qt and ¯t∗∗ ≡ b̄t∗∗ pt /qt .
¯

4.2. Logit Demand
The method for incorporating limiting information assuming logit demand is similar to that assuming linear demand. Start by considering the limit p → 0 and comparing equilibrium points e t
and et  for t  > t. Assumption 2 implies D̃(p, αt , et ) ≤ D̃(p, αt  , et  ) for all p ≥ 0. In particular, this
inequality must hold for p = 0: i.e., D̃(0, αt , et ) ≤ D̃(0, αt  , et  ). Substituting for D̃ from (3) in the
previous inequality yields qt [1 + exp(αt pt )] ≤ qt  [1 + exp(αt  pt  )], or upon rearranging,

(43)

To explore the other limit, p → ∞, suppose t  > t. Expressing its implication in terms of a ratio
rather than a difference, Assumption 2 implies
lim

p→∞

D̃(p, αt , et )
≤ 1.
D̃(p, αt  , et  )

(44)

Evaluation of this limit is somewhat involved, so the details are deferred to the appendix proof. The
24

result, however, is simple. We show that a necessary condition for (44) is αt ≥ αt  . In words, under
logit demand, for demand to grow over time requires the price-sensitivity parameter to shrink over
time. Using the result from Proposition 3 that α t  ≥ αt∗ , this leads to the lower bound αt ≥ αt∗ for
¯
¯


∗
all t > t. For t < t, the reverse inequality is required: αt ≤ αt  ≤ ᾱt  .
The following proposition summarizes the preceding analysis. The appendix proof fills in the
omitted detail.
Proposition 7. Suppose the sequence of logit demands D̃(p, bt , et ) defined in (16) satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2. Then αt ∈ [αt∗∗ , ᾱt∗∗] for all t ∈ {1, . . ., T }, where

The complex formulas in Proposition 7 for logit demand look very different from those in

Proposition 6 for linear demand. We will see in the empirical application to the Du Pont decision,
however, that they generate nearly identical bounds on the elasticities. Reassuringly, the bounds incorporating limiting information are more robust to functional-form assumptions than the formulas
might suggest.

4.3. General Demand
The logic used to derive bounds incorporating limiting information for logit demand carries over
to general demand. We have the following proposition, proved in the appendix.
Proposition 8. Suppose the sequence of general demands D̃(p, θt , et ) defined in (24) satisfies As-

25

sumptions 1 and 2 as well as conditions (25)–(27). Then θ t ∈ [θt∗∗, θ̄t∗∗] for all t ∈ {1, . . ., T }, where

The algorithm for computing bounds incorporating limiting information prescribed in the proposition is an iterative procedure. For example, the lower bounds θt∗ incorporating local information
¯
are computed in a first iteration; the θt∗ for all equilibrium points e t  ∈ E are then used to compute
¯
∗∗
the new lower bound θt for the single equilibrium point e t in the second iteration. Lower bounds
¯
from the first iteration are used in the computation of lower bounds in the second iteration; upper
bounds from the first iteration are used to compute upper bounds in the second iteration.
More specifically, to compute the lower bound θt∗∗ , one solves the equation for θ,
¯
lim

for each t  < t and takes the largest solution. One then solves a similar equation, just involving a
different limit, for θ,

D̃(p, θ, et )

D̃(p, θt∗ , et  )

for each t > t and takes the largest solution. The new bound θt∗∗ is set to whichever is largest of

t  < t to (50), and (c) the largest solution over t  > t to (51). The upper bound θ̄t∗∗ is computed

analogously.
To translate the bounds on θt into bounds on the elasticity t , the arguments behind Proposition 5, which we will not repeat here, continue to apply. Defining

5. Institutional Background
That completes the discussion of general methods. We next turn to the empirical application,
beginning with some institutional background on the plastics market and the Du Pont decision.
The use of plastic in consumer goods—in the products themselves and their packaging—is so
widespread today that it is hard to envision the world in the 1950s and 1960s when plastic was
initially developed and diffused commercially. Polyethylene was among the first commercially
developed plastics. We focus on two types, low- and high-density. Low-density polyethylene was
famously used to make Tupperware food-storage containers (Clarke 1999, p. 2) and high-density
polyethylene to make Hula Hoops (Fenichell 1996, p. 264). Polyethylene remains the highestvolume commercial plastic in terms of global sales.
In the late 1930s, the U.S. Department of Justice sought to prosecute Du Pont, a U.S. manufacturer of polyethylene, and its U.K. co-conspirator Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), for their
Patents and Processes agreement. Signed in 1929, the agreement granted each company exclusive
licenses for the patents and secret processes controlled by the other and divided the global market
into exclusive territories between them. Views differ on whether the main motive for the agreement was the sharing of complementary technologies or the monopolization achieved by market
division (Hounshell and Smith 1999, p. 190). The Department of Justice viewed the Patents and
Processes agreement as an illegal market division, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
The military significance of the chemical industry led Franklin Roosevelt’s administration to lobby
to suspend legal action during the Second World War (Reader 1975, p. 432). After the war, the
case proceeded to trial. The prosecution won a liability verdict in 1951, and Judge Sylvester Ryan
ordered a remedy in 1952.
Judge Ryan’s order cancelled the exclusive-territory arrangements between Du Pont and ICI
and required them to license patents and secret processes involved in the manufacture of several
of their products to all applicants at reasonable royalty rates. The incumbents’ most significant
patents covered three products: polyethylene, nylon, and neoprene. Judge Ryan did not order the
compulsory licensing of neoprene. Of the remaining products, commentators have contended that
only the polyethylene patents garnered substantial commercial interest (Whitney 1958, p. 217).
Thus, we focus on the structural remedy’s effect on the polyethylene market.
Whether compulsory licensing solves the monopolization problem is the subject of debate in
27

the antitrust literature. In their seminal legal casebook, Areeda, Kaplow, and Edlin (2013) note
that the terms of such licensing typically remain subject to commercial negotiations of the parties.
This leaves open the possibility that the licensor preserves the monopoly outcome by specifying
exorbitant rates.5 At one point, ICI was asking for a fixed fee of $500,000 and royalties amounting
to eight percent of sales revenue (Fortune, 1954). Since this royalty applied to revenue not profit,
it would have added to markups, whether as much as the monopoly level may be hard for industry
outsiders to know. Expanding the incumbents’ scope to manipulate the licensing outcome in their
favor, patents often do not relate all the information necessary for entrants to replicate a production
process. While Judge Ryan ordered incumbents to provide accompanying manuals and training,
the question remains whether these materials were sufficient to allow the entrants to operate on an
even footing with incumbents.
The remedy ostensibly had a dramatic effect on the polyethylene market (Backman 1964,
p. 71). Seven manufacturers entered in 1953–56 and four more in 1956–59. Prices steadily declined and output rose. On the face of these facts, one might be tempted to conclude that Judge
Ryan’s remedy achieved its purpose of turning a monopoly into a more competitive market. However, the same price declines and output increases may have arisen in a monopoly market experiencing substantial cost declines, plausibly realistic for plastics in the 1950s and 60s. The fact of
entry seems to disprove monopoly unless it is thought that the entrants are merely producing their
share of the monopoly quantity, returning most of the rents to the licensor. Thus our study will try
to produce evidence for effective remedy that cuts through these criticisms.
To the extent the remedy was successful, a contributing factor may have been that the market
was monopolized not by a single firm but by two independent firms, which used the Patents and
Processes agreement to facilitate collusion. With the agreement cancelled by Judge Ryan’s remedy, the independent operators may have been thrown into competition together to license their
technologies. This may have disciplined exorbitant licensing fees and thwarted an attempt to preserve the monopoly outcome. That said, the question remains whether incumbents with a history
of collusion needed the explicit legal agreement to maintain a cooperative relationship.
5 Judge

Ryan himself foresaw the potential difficulty in defining a reasonable royalty rate: “While it is true that
as to [royalty rates] question might well be raised as to whether they were arrived at after arm’s length commercial
negotiations, they do nevertheless furnish guide posts for future determination of the amount at which such royalties
should be set. But, in any event, as to these products and all others, there is also available for judicial finding the sum
a prudent licensee would pay under all existing circumstances.” (US vs. ICI, 1952, p. 227–228.)

6. Data
Our dataset consists of annual price and quantity data, aggregated across all firms the U.S. market,
for two plastic products, low- and high-density polyethylene, in the period following the imposition
of the remedy in the Du Pont (1952) case. The foundation of our dataset is provided by Table 1 of
Lieberman (1984), which presents the data he obtained from the annual reports, Synthetic Organic
Chemicals: United States Production and Sales, issued by the U.S. Tariff Commission. The earliest
date that price and quantity are reported for polyethylene is 1958, so Lieberman’s data begin then.
Lieberman ends the series in 1972 because in subsequent years the OPEC crisis created an oil
shock which, together with the subsequent recession, disrupted supply and demand in the plastics
market.
Rather than taking Lieberman’s data directly, we returned to the original U.S. Tariff Commission source for two reasons. First, we noticed some typographical errors. Second, he recorded
production for his quantity variable. Since we are interested in estimates of demand, we went back
and collected sales for our quantity variable. 6 Our final dataset consists of prices (measured in
nominal dollars per pound) and sales quantities (measured in billion pounds) for low- and highdensity polyethylene from 1958–72. The price series is an average wholesale price, computed by
dividing total annual industry revenue by industry quantity sold.
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics. Prices are roughly the same across the products. Quan6 Production equals

the sum of sales, change in inventories, contract production using the customer’s raw materials,
and production consumed directly by the manufacturer. While we believe sales best captures quantity demanded,
we repeat the empirical analysis using production as our quantity measure. The results, presented in Figure B2 in
Appendix B, are qualitatively close to those using sales for quantity.

tity sold in the market for low-density polyethylene was about twice that in the market for highdensity polyethylene.
Figure 6 displays the evolution of equilibrium over time for the two products in the two panels.
The curves are of course not demand; each dot is an equilibrium point resulting from the interaction
of demand and a supply relation in the given year. The figure shows how these equilibrium points
shift over time. The predominant pattern is for equilibrium to shift to the southeast each year.
With one exception, the equilibrium never shifts southwest over time, thus exhibiting rectangular
expansion.7
The lone exception is 1963 for low-density polyethylene. Our analysis excludes that product7 The

year. As a robustness check, we redo the analysis preserving rectangular expansion by dropping
1962 rather than 1963. The results, reported in Figure B1 in Appendix B, are quantitatively quite
similar. We think the most likely cause of this violation of rectangular expansion is that the market
may have been growing but not fast enough to offset a small perturbation in price and/or quantity
or a small observation error that made it look like demand shrunk that year. Section 8 discusses
several approaches to robust estimation that allows for such perturbations.

7. Empirical Results
This section presents empirical results using our methods for bounding elasticity of demand  t . The
nature of our dataset happens to allow only meaningful upper, not lower, bounds to be obtained.
We are not able to obtain meaningful lower bounds because SE −(et ) and NW +(et ) happen to be
empty for all et ∈ E in our dataset. A lower bound of 0 is obtained by default—as a consequence of
the law of demand (Assumption 1). Thus t will always be bounded in an interval extending from 0
to the upper bound we derive. We perform all our analyses assuming both linear and logit demands
to gauge robustness to functional form and for two products, low- and high-density polyethylene.
The results are presented graphically in Figure 7, low-density polyethylene in Panels A–B and
high-density polyethylene in Panels C–D. For each product, the top panels present results using
the method incorporating local information from pairwise equilibrium comparisons, generating
the upper bound ¯t∗. The bottom panels present results using the method incorporating limiting
information, generating the upper bound ¯ t∗∗. For reference, the precise numerical elasticities are
provided in Table 2.
The figure displays bootstrapped confidence intervals around upper bounds ¯ t∗ or ¯t∗∗ as whiskers
at the top of the bars. Because our upper bounds involve an extreme order statistic (in particular the
minimum of results from pairwise comparisons), standard bootstrapping methods are invalid. We
instead use the bootstrapping method for extreme order statistics proposed by Zelterman (1993).
We defer a detailed discussion of the Zelterman (1993) bootstrap to Section 8.1. We chose to display a two-tailed 90% confidence interval because this allows easy visualization of the one-tailed
test of whether the elasticity bound is less than 1 at the standard (5%) significance level. The
starred significance levels in Table 2 are also based on the Zelterman (1993) bootstrap.
Focus first on the results in Panel A for low-density polyethylene using the method incorpo31

rating local information. Within the panel, focus first on the dark-shaded bars, representing the
elasticity bounds imposing linear demand. The results are remarkable. Aside from the first year, in
which the upper bound is quite high at 2.50, the upper bound on the elasticity is consistently low,
never higher than 0.68—which is still quite inelastic.
The upper bound can be much lower than this, in particular, 0.09 and 0.08 in 1959 and 1960.
The robustness of the extremely low bounds in those years is called into question, however, by the
wide confidence intervals around them, in 1960 even straying above the threshold of 1 that might
be consistent with monopoly behavior. The next section will provide a more detailed discussion of
robustness. For now, we will note that a consistent finding in our results—holding across specifications, methods, and products—is that the upper bounds in the early years in the sample are either
quite high, or have wide confidence intervals, or both. 8
8 We

suspect the weak results for early years are not a symptom of an idiosyncratically high elasticity in that year;
we have no evidence to suggest that polyethylene demand was markedly different in early compared to later years.

33

Setting aside the admittedly weak results for the early years and focusing on the remaining
1961–72 sample, we see that the upper bound is below 0.5 a majority of the time, significantly
less than 1 at the 1% level in a one-tailed test for all of these years except 1962, in which the test
is significant at the 10% level. Such low elasticities are inconsistent with a monopoly outcome,
which in theory leads to an equilibrium in the elastic region of demand.
The light-shaded bars represent elasticity bounds assuming logit rather than linear demand. The
results are consistent across the two functional forms in Panel A. The logit bound can be tighter
or looser than that under linear: in the early years, logit demand generates tighter bounds (or at
least tighter bootstrap whiskers); in later years, linear demand tends to generate tighter bounds.
Overall, the two specifications track each other closely, rising and falling together over the sample,
suggesting the results are robust to functional-form assumptions. Setting aside the weak results in
the early years (1958–60), in the later years (1961–72), the elasticity bound under logit is as low
as 0.51. The bound is significantly less than 1 at the 1% level for a majority of these years at least
the 5% level for all these later years except 1972, when it is significant at just the 10% level.
Panel B presents results for low-density polyethylene using the method incorporating limiting
information. The estimates for linear and logit demand are almost identical; both are are sharply
tighter than in Panel A. When limiting information is incorporated, the upper bounds on the elasticity shrink down to around 0.4 in the first year and extremely close to 0 in all later years. The
confidence intervals suggest that the extremeness of these estimates may not be particularly robust:
the whisker representing the upper confidence-interval threshold is an order of magnitude higher
than the estimated elasticity bound, which shrinks as low as 0.03 in the last five years. The low
elasticity bounds obtained in the first stage from the pairwise comparison of the years 1959 and
1960 incorporating local information generates extreme limits that propagate across all the other
years in the second stage incorporating that limiting information. Bootstrap subsamples which
happen not to include information from this pairwise comparison will be higher, widening the
confidence interval. That said, the upper confidence-interval thresholds, although higher than the
corresponding bounds, are still only about half the size of those in Panel A, suggesting that the
Two other causes are more likely. First, early years lack prior-year information to bound the elasticities. Second,
our methods work by first bounding the demand slope, multiplying by price and dividing by quantity to derive the
elasticity. As Figure 6 shows, polyethylene prices were relatively high and quantities low in the early years. For a
given slope bound, adjusting by price and quantity will naturally lead to high elasticity bounds.

method incorporating limiting information can lead to a meaningful improvement over the method
incorporating only local information. In the last five years of the sample, not only are the elasticities less than 1 at the 1% significance level in a one-tailed test, they are less than 0.42 at the 1%
significance level for both linear and logit demands—indeed, less than 0.32 at the 1% significance
level for linear demand.
The results incorporating limiting information strengthen the conclusion that demand was very
inelastic in some post-remedy years, far from the range consistent with monopoly. The bounds are
virtually numerically identical whether linear or logit demand is assumed. The crucial assumption
behind this method appears to be not the specific functional form assumed but, whatever that form
is, that it is consistent across the domain of prices.
Panels C–D present elasticity bounds for the other product, high-density polyethylene. In this
market, the bounds are much wider in the early years compared to low-density polyethylene, necessitating a different vertical-axis scale to display. The bounds narrow considerably by 1963, the
upper bound reaching as low as 0.34 for linear demand and 0.35 for logit demand in that year.
The bounds remain well within the inelastic region under linear demand. Under logit demand the
upper bound rises up above 1 in 1966 and remains around that level for the rest of the sample. The
bound is significantly less than 1 at at least the 10% level in only four of the years. It should be
emphasized that the logit-demand bounds do not imply that the elasticity was this high but that this
method at least cannot rule such high elasticities out. Overall, the upper bound on the elasticity
is higher in the high-density market than low-density market, but even in the high-density market,
elastic demand and monopoly is precluded in some years in the post-remedy period.
Panel D applies the method incorporating limiting information to the high-density polyethylene
market. As in Panel C, the bounds (or the whiskers for the upper confidence-interval threshold)
are not particularly tight in the first five years; but by 1964 the upper bound has shrunk below 0.3,
and continues to shrink steadily, down to around 0.16 by 1972. After 1964, the bounds are all
significantly less than 1 at the 1% level. Regardless of the functional form assumed, incorporating
limiting information provides extremely tight bounds on the elasticity of demand in the highdensity market. For nearly a decade, demand in each market was well below the level consistent
with monopoly according to this method.

Figure 8: Vulnerability of Method to Observation Errors in Slow-Growing Market

8. Robustness
Our method implicitly assumes price and quantity are perfectly observed. Observation errors can
create potential problems for our method. These problems are likely to be relatively inconsequential if the market is growing rapidly over the sample but may be acute if the market experiences
periods of only slow growth.
Figure 8 illustrates the potential vulnerability. To take an extreme example, suppose a monopoly
serves a market that is unchanging over time. Suppose that the true equilibrium point e 1 continue
into period 2 as e2 , but due to an observation error or other small perturbation, e 2 is instead recorded
in the data. Using our method, say assuming linear demand, pairwise comparison of e 1 and e2 implies that the inverse demand curve in both periods would have to be at least as steep as the line
drawn. If the perturbation happened to nudge e 2 almost directly south of e1 , we would conclude
that demand was almost perfectly inelastic, erroneously rejecting monopoly control of the market. Rapid market growth—driving e 1 and e2 apart instead of lying on top of each other—would
attenuate the effect of a small perturbation from e 2 to e2 on the estimated elasticity bound.
The concern is not just theoretical. In our application, one might be concerned that the extremely low elasticity bounds of 0.08 and 0.09 in Panel A of Figure 7 were generated by a single
perturbation from 1959 to 1960 in the low-density polyethylene market rather than being a robust
consequence of many pairwise comparisons. The configuration of the 1959 and 1960 equilibrium
points in Panel A of Figure 6 resembles that in Figure 8, with the points lying close enough to-

36

gether that a small southward perturbation could generate an almost vertical line connecting them
and a elasticity bound close to zero.
We address the robustness concern in two ways. The next subsection discusses the computation
of bootstrapped confidence intervals. If the estimates are unduly influenced by the position of one
or two equilibria, we will see higher estimates in bootstrapped subsamples from which they are
omitted, widening the confidence intervals. Subsection 8.2 introduces an estimator that leaves out
the most influential equilibrium points. We will see that the leave-out estimator appears to stabilize
after leaving out the single most influential equilibrium point, the result corresponding closely to
the bootstrapped 95% upper confidence-interval threshold.

8.1. Bootstrapping
A natural way to generate error bounds around our estimates is to apply a resampling technique
such as boostrapping to the pairwise comparisons between equilibrium points. Standard bootstrap
methods are invalid in our context because our upper elasticity bound involves an extreme order
statistic, the minimum over pairwise comparisons between a given equilibrium point and others.
As Bickel and Freedman (1981) note, it is impossible to draw a pseudosample generating an order
statistic more extreme than that generated with the original data because any pseudosample is a
subset of the original data. Hence the bootstrapped distribution will be bounded by—rather than
centered on—the extreme order statistic estimated from the original data.
Zelterman (1993) provides a technique for circumventing this problem. Instead of sampling
the data directly, he proposes sampling the spacings among the highest k observations. Suitably
normalized, these spacings asymptotically have an iid exponential distribution. Since the asymptotic result holds for a broad class of distributions of the underlying data, Zelterman classifies the
technique as semiparametric, the sole parameter being the k anchoring the order statistic to which
the sampled spacings are appended when simulating the extreme order statistic.
Formally, consider applying Zelterman’s (1993) technique to bootstrap a confidence interval
around ¯∗ , the upper bound on the demand elasticity from our first-stage method incorporating local
[1]

[2]

[T −1]

information. Let ¯t ≤ ¯t ≤ · · · ≤ ¯t

be elasticity bounds derived from pairwise comparisons

between et and the other equilibrium points ordered from smallest to largest; superscripts on these
[i]

[i+1]

terms thus denote the order of these order statistics. Let dt ≡ i(¯t
37

[i]

−¯t ) denote the normalized

spacing between two of these ordered bounds. Note that the normalization needed to generate
the exponential distribution asymptotically is simply multiplication by i, the degree of the order
[i]

statistics involved in the spacing. Let dt ≡ {dt | i = 1, . . ., k} denote the set of the normalized
spacings observed in the data between the k lowest pairwise elasticity bounds. One draws a number
of pseudosamples d̃t = {d˜ti} of size k with replacement from dt . The bootstrapped elasticity is
computed as
[k+1]

˜t∗ ≡ ¯t

k

− ∑ d˜ti/i.

(53)

i=1

Intuitively, k draws of normalized spacings are subtracted (after reversing the normalization by
[k+1]

dividing by i) from the observed k + 1st order statistic ¯ t

, which serves as a sort of anchor for the

procedure, to arrive at the simulated minimum ˜ t∗. Following Zelterman’s (1993) recommendation,
we take k = T − 1/3.9,10
Bootstrapping the bound ¯ ∗∗, which incorporates limiting information, is more involved because it is a two-stage estimator, and the outcome of the second stage depends in a complicated
way on the first stage. We adopt what in our view is the most natural alternative: applying Zelterman’s (1993) technique to simulate a bootstrapped estimate from the normalized spacings observed
in each separate stage, and then taking the minimum over the result from each stages to generate
the final bootstrapped bound ˜ t∗∗.11,12
(1993) notes that the asymptotic argument requires k → ∞ as well as T → ∞. Our sample of pairwise
comparisons is small since it comes from a relatively short time series. We still proceed to apply the technique and the
recommendation for k but note that we may be straining the asymptotic arguments behind the bootstrap. On a positive
note, despite the small size of T and k in our application, the bootstrapped confidence intervals appear quite sensible
and well behaved.
10 We take 10,000 bootstrap draws to provide the precision demanded by 99% confidence intervals. The bootstrap
procedure is written in Stata code, available on request from the authors. Even for the logit specification, which
involves numerical solution of a nonlinear equation for each draw, running the procedure with 10,000 draws only
takes a few minutes on a desktop computer.
11 An alternative would be to bootstrap the demand parameter rather than the elasticity directly. In the case of
linear demand, bt could be bootstrapped. Then the first stage bound ( b̄∗ ) could be treated equivalently to the pairwise
comparisons between et and the other equilibrium points incorporating limiting information in the second stage (the
expressions in braces in equation (41)). We tried this alternative, and the results were nearly identical to the alternative
we adopted.
12 While the bootstrapped confidence intervals around ¯
 ∗∗ should typically be tighter than around ˜ t∗ , randomness
in the draws can lead the reverse to happen in isolated cases. We see this in for example in Table 2, in the 1961
entries for low-density polyethylene: the one-tailed test is more significant for the first-stage method incorporating
local information than the second-stage method incorporating limiting information. In virtually all of the rest of the
entries, the second-stage confidence intervals are tighter than the first-stage.

8.2. Leave-Out Estimators
Rather than starting with an estimator that is potentially vulnerable to small perturbations and
drawing a confidence interval around it to gauge its vulnerability, an alternative approach is to
propose a robust estimator to begin with. This is the approach taken in this subsection in which we
propose a series of leave-out estimators.
In particular, L̄t∗(1) leaves the most influential observation out of the calculation of the upper bound on the demand elasticity; formally, L̄t∗(1) ≡ maxt  =t ¯∗ et  , where ¯∗ S is the upper bound on the elasticity restricting the sample to E \ S rather than using all of E as does ¯ ∗ .
Analogously, the leave-two-out estimator L̄t∗ (2) leaves the two most influential observations out:
L̄t∗ (2) ≡ maxt  ,t  =t ¯∗et  , et  . We can also analogously define the leave-out estimators associated with the method incorporating limiting information: L̄t∗∗(1) ≡ maxt  =t ¯∗∗et   and L̄t∗∗(2) ≡
maxt  ,t  =t ¯∗∗et  , et  , where ¯∗∗S is defined analogously to ¯∗S except that the former incorporates limiting information. Leave-out estimators with orders higher than two can also be defined. 13
Figure 9 presents the results from the leave-out estimators. The shaded bars repeat the elasticity
bounds from Figure 7. The difference are the whiskers, which before represented boostrapped
confidence intervals but now represent the extension to the upper bound when the one or two
most influential pairwise comparisons are left out. The thick whisker is the extention due to the
leave-one-out estimator and the thin whisker to the leave-two-out estimator.
Across the four panels A–D, we see that the leave-out estimators lead to a jump in the upper
bound for the early years and across all years for the method incorporating limiting information.
These results confirm the claim that the tight bounds for 1959 and 1960 were due to the positioning
of 1960 almost vertically below 1959. When one or the other is left out, this causes the upper
bound in 1959 and 1960 in Panel A to jump up to a level more consistent with the other years.
This extremely tight bound in the first stage led to extreme limits that propogated across the other
years in the second stage incorporating limiting information. When one or the other year is left out
of the first stage, we see in Panel B that the bounds incorporating limiting information jump from
jackknife is also a leave-out estimator, its resemblance to L̄t∗ (1) and our other leave-out estimators
ends there. The jackknife averages over estimates from leave-out samples whereas L̄t∗ (1) takes the worst case—in the
case of upper bounds their maximum—over leave-out samples. Further, the jackknife averages over pseudovalues (a
suitably weighted difference between the original and leave-out estimates), whereas L̄t∗ (1) is computed directly from
the leave-out estimates, and the computation does not involve the original estimate. The jackknife is invalid in our
setting for the same reason given by Bickel and Freedman (1981) that the bootstrap is invalid.

near zero to something more moderate.
While the leave-out estimators lead to higher elasticity bounds than the original in Figure 9,
we can still take some reassurance from the figure. First, while the bounds jump up in some
early years, in later years, the leave-out estimators remain below the threshold of 1 above which
monopoly cannot be ruled out. In particular, for linear demand in the market for low-density
polyethylene in Panel A, L̄t∗ (1) is below 0.5 in a number of later years. For both linear and logit
demand, L̄t∗∗(1) is below 0.5 for in all of the last six years in Panel B. The leave-out bounds are
nearly as tight in the later years for high-density polyethylene in Panels B and D.
Also reassuring is the stability of the leave-out estimators: in years after the first three, the thin
whisker does not extend much beyond the thick one, implying that the leave-one-out and leavetwo-out estimators are quite close. Leaving one pairwise comparison out appears to be sufficient
to protect against the vulnerability to small perturbations illustrated in Figure 8.
Figure 10 plots the two approaches to robustness against each other: the 95% bootstrapped
upper confidence threshold from Figure 7 on the horizontal axis against the leave-one-out estimator
from Figure 9 on the vertical axis. The two approaches to robustness produce almost identical
results, lying almost precisely on the 45-degree line. The small departures in Panel B are mostly
above the 45-degree line, indicating that the leave-one-out estimator produces a larger estimate,
and thus would provide a more conservative test that the bound is below the threshold (1) used to
rule out monopoly behavior. Both results produce many observations inside the dotted box with
dimensions less than 1, the threshold below which we can rule out monopoly behavior.

9. Conclusion
This paper provided a methodology for bounding the elasticity of demand that works in growing
markets for homogeneous products. The underlying idea is that the demand curve through a given
equilibrium point cannot be either so steep or so flat that it passes below earlier equilibria or above
later equilibria without violating the assumption that demand is nondecreasing over time. These
inequality conditions place bounds on the elasticity of demand in any given year. The method
requires minimal information, working with as few as two time-series observations on aggregate
prices and quantities.
A potential drawback of any methodology delivering bounds rather than point estimates is that

the resulting bounds may be so wide as to be uninformative. In our empirical application to the
polyethylene market in the 1958–72 period after a licensing remedy was ordered, the methodology
turned out to quite informative. A good snapshot of the results is provided by Table 2. There,
with few exceptions, we see a cascade of three-starred entries in every year in 1964–72, indicating
an upper bound on the demand elasticity that is significantly less than 1 at the 1% level. This is
true across products (low- versus high-density polyethylene), demand specifications (linear versus
logit), and methodologies (incorporating local versus limiting information). The main exception is
the column for high-density polyethylene assuming logit demand using the method incorporating
only local information. While we do not see the same cascade of three-starred results in that
column, we still see elasticity bounds significant at the 10% level or better in four of the years.
Based on our finding that the elasticity of demand was bounded in the elastic region, in many
years bounded well away at strong significance levels, we reject the contention that monopoly
behavior effected by the Patents and Processes agreement between Du Pont and ICI continued
after Judge Ryan’s remedy in the Du Pont case.
The configuration of equilibrium points in 1959 and 1960 in the low-density polyethylene market, with the 1960 lying close to but almost vertically below 1959, raised a question of robustness.
Assuming price and quantity are perfectly observed, this configuration provides strong evidence
against monopoly. A monopolist would never have dropped its price even by the modest amount
experienced unless it would have generated a more substantial gain in quantity, leaving competitive pressure as a plausible explanation of what drove the price drop. These considerations were
reflected in the extremely low upper bounds on the demand elasticity for those years, as low as
0.08. This first-stage local comparison propagated into extremely low second-stage bounds incorporating limiting information for all years. This happened because the vertical intercepts for the
inverse demands through 1959 and 1960 (or the inverse-demand limits for logit demand) needed
to be extremely high to reflect the extremely inelastic demands, forcing later years to also have
extremely high vertical intercepts and low elasticities. If the configuration of equilibrium points in
1959–60 were not an actual vertical drop but a small perturbation to fairly stable equilibrium, the
extremely tight bounds may have been spurious.
We dealt with the robustness issue in two ways. First, we provided bootstrapped confidence intervals around the estimates using a procedure due to Zelterman (1993) for extreme order statistics.

43

Second, we proposed estimators leaving out the most influential equilibria for pairwise comparison. The leave-one-out estimator generated almost exactly the same result as the 95% bootstrapped
upper confidence threshold across products, functional-forms, and methods. The tight bounds for
early years such as 1959 and 1960 using the method incorporating local information were shown
not to be robust, nor were the extremely tight bounds across all years using the method incorporating limiting information. However, the elasticity bounds remained significantly less than 1 in
many years, a robust finding across products, functional forms, and methods. After one the most
influential observation was left out, leaving more out did not appear to have much effect on the
more robust findings in the last decade of our sample.
The Du Pont application serves as a proof of concept for our bounding methodology, which
could be applied to any growing market involving homogeneous products. Based on our investigation into robustness, we strongly suggest using a leave-one-out version of our estimator or
displaying bootstrapped confidence intervals. We hope other researchers will find value in our
methodology and find it easy to apply using the Stata code available on request.
In theory, one should be able to obtain analogous elasticity bounds in the opposite case of a
declining market simply by reversing all the signs and inequalities. This is theoretically true but
requires several practical caveats. First, even for markets experiencing secular declines, it may
be hard to contend that the demand curve is definitively shifting back each year. Consumers may
be losing their taste for a product, but natural population growth may offset this taste change.
Second, even if suppliers are not investing much, the spillover of technology from other industries
may lower costs in the market, shifting supply out. Equilibrium points may end up shifting to the
southwest over time, offering little useful information to bound elasticities.

Appendix A: Proofs
Proof of Proposition 3: The text defines A(et , et  ) as the solution for α in (20), rearranged here
as

g(α, pt , pt  ) = t ,
qt
where
1 + exp(αpt )
g(α, pt , pt  ) ≡

(A2)
1 + exp(αpt  )
Before proceeding, we prove several useful facts about g. First,
g(0, pt , pt  ) = 1.

[1 + exp(αpt  )]2

(A4)

Next, differentiating (A2),

Equation (A4) implies g is monotonic in α, increasing for p t > pt  and decreasing for pt < pt  . To
compute its limit as α → ∞, we first rearrange (A2) as
g(α, pt , pt  ) =

1 + exp(−αpt )
.
exp(α(pt  − pt )) + exp(−αpt )

(A5)

Then it is apparent that
lim g(α, pt , pt  ) =

α→∞

0
∞

pt < pt 
pt > pt  .

(A6)

To apply these facts, first suppose pt > pt  . Then the facts from the previous paragraph imply
that g increases from 1 to ∞ as α increases from 0 to ∞. Equation (A1) has a solution if and
only if qt  > qt . But pt > pt  and qt  > qt imply that et  ∈ SE(et ). Next, suppose pt  > pt . Then
the facts from the previous paragraph imply that g decreases from 1 to 0 as α increases from 0
to ∞. Equation (A1) has a solution if and only if q t  < qt . But pt > pt  and qt  < qt imply that
et  ∈ NW(et ). Therefore, (A1) has a solution if and only if et  ∈ SE(et ) ∪ NW(et ). If (A1) has a
solution, the monotonicity of g implies that this solution is unique.
The text analyzes the case in which t < t  , showing that (19) is a necessary condition for
Assumption 2 not to be violated. One can verify that (19) is satisfied for all α ≥ 0 if e t  ∈ NE + (et ),
implying that this subset does not contribute to bounds on αt . One can verify that (19) is satisfied
for all α ≥ A(et , et  ) if et  ∈ NW + (et ), implying that this subset contributes lower bounds on αt .
One can verify that (19) is satisfied for all α ≤ A(et , et  ) if et  ∈ SE +(et ), implying that this subset
contributes upper bounds on αt .
We complete the proof by analyzing the case in which t > t  . To respect Assumption 2, we
must have
D̃(p, αt , et ) = Dt (p) ≥ Dt  (p) = D̃(p, αt  , et  ).

Substituting p = pt  ,
qt [1 + exp(αt pt )]
= D̃(pt  , αt , et ) ≥ D̃(pt  , αt  , et  ) = qt  ,

or rearranging,
qt [1 + exp(αt pt )] ≥ qt  [1 + exp(αt pt  )].

(A9)

One can verify that (A9) is satisfied for all α ≥ 0 if e t  ∈ SW − (et ), implying that this subset
does not contribute to bounds on αt . One can verify that (A9) is satisfied for all α ≥ A(et , et  ) if
et  ∈ SE − (et ), implying that this subset contributes lower bounds on αt . One can verify that (A9) is
satisfied for all α ≤ A(et , et  ) if et  ∈ NW − (et ), implying that this subset contributes upper bounds
on αt . Q.E.D.
Verifying Logit Satisfies General Demand Conditions: Let D̃(p, θ, et ) be the logit demand
defined in (16) after substituting θ = α. We will verify that this D̃(p, θ, et ) satisfies conditions
(25)–(27).
We verify (25) by direct differentiation. Differentiating D̃(p, θ, et ) with respect to its first argument and substituting p = pt ,
D̃ p(pt , θ, et ) =

−θqt

1 + exp(−θ pt )

Differentiating (A10) with respect to θ and substituting θ = θ t ,
D̃ pθ (pt , θt , et ) =

−qt [1 + (1 + θt pt ) exp(−θt pt )]
,
[1 + exp(−θt pt )]2

(A11)

which is negative, verifying (25).
To verify (26), we can use the notation introduced in the proof of Proposition 3 to write
D̃(p, θ, et ) = qt g(θ, pt , p). Equation (A3) then implies D̃(p, 0, et ) = qt , verifying (26).
To verify (27),
0 p > pt

lim D̃(p, θ, et ) = qt lim g(θ, pt , p) =
θ→∞
θ→∞
∞ p < pt ,
where the last equality follows from (A6). Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 4: The proof closely follows the logic of the proof of Proposition 3, so we
omit most of it for brevity. Here, we fill in the detail that if (25)–(27) hold and e t  ∈ NW(et ) ∪
SE(et ), then (28) has a unique solution.
Suppose et  ∈ NW(et ). Condition (26) implies limθ→0 D̃(pt  , θ, et ) = qt < qt  , where the inequality follows from et  ∈ NW(et ). Condition (27) implies lim θ→∞ D̃(pt  , θ, et ) = ∞ since pt  < pt
for et  ∈ NW(et ). Condition 25 implies that D̃(pt  , θ, et ) is increasing in θ since pt  < pt . Together,
these results imply that D̃(pt  , θ, et ) is below qt  for low θ and monotonically increases in θ until it
exceeds qt  for high θ. Thus, the solution Θ(et , et  ) of (28) exists and is unique.
Suppose et  ∈ SE(et ). Condition (26) implies limθ→0 D̃(pt  , θ, et ) = qt > qt  , where the inequality follows from et  ∈ SE(et ). Condition (27) implies lim θ→∞ D̃(pt  , θ, et ) = 0 since pt  > pt for
et  ∈ SE(et ). Condition (25) implies that D̃(pt  , θ, et ) is decreasing in θ since pt  > pt . Together,
these results imply that D̃(pt  , θ, et ) is above qt  for low θ and monotonically decreases in θ until it
falls below qt  for high θ. Thus, again, the solution Θ(et , et  ) of (28) exists and is unique. Q.E.D.

46

Proof of Proposition 5: The first step of the proof is to show that (25) implies D̃ pθ (pt , θ, et ) ≤ 0.
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that D̃ pθ (pt , θ, et ) > 0. Since D̃ is continuously differentiable
of all orders, D̃ pθ (pt , θ, et ) is continuous in its first argument, implying that there exists δ > 0 such
that D̃ pθ (p, θ, et ) > 0 for all p ∈ (pt − δ, pt + δ). Thus

D̃ pθ (p, θ, et )d p = D̃θ (pt + δ, θ, et ) − D̃θ (pt − δ, θ, et ).

(A13)

But (25) implies D̃(pt − δ, θ, et ) > 0 and D̃(pt + δ, θ, et ) < 0, implying their difference is negative,
not positive as in (A13), a contradiction.

(A16)

Equation (A14) follows from substituting for D̃ from (16), (A15) follows from dividing numerator
and denominator by exp(αt  p) and taking limits, and (A16) follows from evaluating the remaining
limit. We see that (44) is violated if αt < αt  . Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 8:

Start by analyzing the limit p → 0. For t  > t, we have
lim

p→0

D̃(p, θt , et )
D̃(p, θt , et )
≥ lim
≥ 1.
∗
p→0 D̃(p, θt  , et  )
D̃(p, θ̄t  , et  )

(A17)

The first inequality follows from Assumption 2. To see the second inequality, note that in the limit
as p → 0, eventually p ≤ pt  . But (25) then implies D̃θ (p, θ, et  ) ≥ 0, in turn implying D̃(p, θt  , et  ) ≤
D̃(p, θ̄t∗ , et  ) in the limit as p → 0 since θt  ≤ θ̄t∗ by Proposition 4.
Similarly, one can argue that (25) implies that the numerator on the left-hand side of (A17),
and thus the entire left-hand side, is increasing in θt . Condition (A17) treated as an equality,
lim

p→0

D̃(p, θ, et )
,
D̃(p, θ̄t∗ , et  )

(A18)

thus provides an equation in θ that can be solved to provide a lower bound on θ t . The new bound
θt∗∗ in (48) is set to be no lower than the highest of the solutions to (A18) for t  > t.
¯
The analyses for t  < t and for the other limit, p → ∞ are similar and omitted for brevity. Q.E.D.

Figure B1: Elasticity Bounds for Low-Density Polyethylene Dropping Alternate Year to Preserve Rectangular
Expansion. Notes: Rather than dropping 1963 to preserve property of rectangular expansion for equilibrium points,
as done in Panels A–B of Figure 7, the same goal is achieved here by dropping 1962. See Figure 7 for additional notes.

Figure B2: Elasticity Bounds Using Production Data for Quantity. For low-density polyethylene, the whole set of equilibrium points E exhibits
rectangular expansion using production rather than sales data for quantity, so 1963 no longer needs to be dropped. For high-density polyethylene, 1970
now has to be dropped to preserve rectangular expansion. See Figure 7 for additional notes.
