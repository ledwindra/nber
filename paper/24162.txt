Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness of Recursive Utilities

JEL No. D81,G11
ABSTRACT
We study existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions for a class of discrete time recursive
utilities models. By combining two streams of the recent literature on recursive preferences - one
that analyzes principal eigenvalues of valuation operators and another that exploits the theory of
monotone concave operators - we obtain conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for
existence and uniqueness. We also show that the natural iterative algorithm is convergent if and
only if a solution exists. Consumption processes are allowed to be nonstationary.

1. I NTRODUCTION
Recursive preference models such as those discussed in Koopmans (1960), Epstein
and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990) play an important role in macroeconomic and financial modeling. For example, the long-run risk models analyzed in Bansal and
Yaron (2004), Hansen et al. (2008), Bansal et al. (2012) and Schorfheide et al. (2017)
have employed such preferences in discrete time infinite horizon settings with a
variety of consumption path specifications to help resolve long-standing empirical
puzzles identified in the literature.
In recursive utilities models, the lifetime value of a consumption stream from a
given point in time is expressed as the solution to a nonlinear forward-looking
equation. While this representation is convenient and intuitive, it can also be vacuous, in the sense that no finite solution to the forward looking recursion exists.
Moreover, even when a solution does exist, this solution lacks predictive content
unless some form of uniqueness can also be established. In general, identifying
restrictions that imply existence and uniqueness of a solution for an empirically
relevant class of consumption streams is a nontrivial problem.
The aim of the present paper is to obtain existence and uniqueness results that are
as tight as possible in a range of empirically plausible settings, while restricting attention to practical conditions that can be tested in applied work. More specifically,
we provide conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions to the class of
preferences studied in Epstein and Zin (1989), while admitting consumption paths
that follow a general multiplicative functional specification (see, e.g., Hansen and
Scheinkman, 2009, 2012). These conditions are both necessary and sufficient, and
hence as tight as possible in the setting we consider. In particular, if the conditions
hold then a unique, globally attracting solution exists, while if not then no finite
solution exists.
To give more detail on that setting, let preferences be defined recursively by the
CES aggregator
i1/(1−1/ψ)
h
1−1/ψ
Vt = (1 − β)Ct
+ β {Rt (Vt+1 )}1−1/ψ
,
(1)
where {Ct } is a consumption path, Vt is the utility value of the path extending on
from time t and Rt is the Kreps–Porteus certainty equivalent operator

Rt (Vt+1 ) := (Et Vt1+−1γ )1/(1−γ) .

(2)

3

The parameter β ∈ (0, 1) is a time discount factor, while γ governs risk aversion
and ψ is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). To ensure that (1) and (2)
are well defined, γ and ψ are required to be distinct from 1.
We assume that consumption growth can be expressed as
ln(Ct+1 /Ct ) = κ ( Xt+1 , Yt+1 , Xt ),

(3)

where κ is a continuous real-valued function, { Xt } is a time homogeneous Markov
process and {Yt } is an IID innovation process. The persistent component { Xt } is
required to be compact-valued, while the innovation {Yt } is allowed to be unbounded.
We seek a solution to normalized utility Vt /Ct expressed as a function of the state
Xt . Our conditions for existence and uniqueness feature two components. The first
is the sign of the composite parameter
θ :=

1−γ
.
1 − 1/ψ

(4)

The other is r (K ), the spectral radius of a valuation operator K determined by
the primitives in (1)–(3) and specified below. We focus on the expression r (K )1/θ ,
which, as shown below, represents the discounted long-term growth rate of the
risk-adjusted value of the consumption process that enters recursion (1), adjusted
by the intertemporal substitutability of consumption. We show that a unique solution exists if and only if r (K )1/θ < 1. We also prove that the same condition is
necessary and sufficient for global convergence of fixed point iteration.
With a view to applications, we then study the test value r (K )1/θ and show that it
can be calculated via a local spectral radius result for positive operators acting on a
solid cone. We first apply this idea to a model with deterministic time trend studied in Alvarez and Jermann (2005), where the test value r (K )1/θ can be obtained
analytically. We show that the sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness
of a solution in Alvarez and Jermann (2005) can be sharpened appreciably, since
the short term fluctuations in consumption accommodated in their condition do
not matter over the long horizons that determine lifetime utility. Second, we apply
these local spectral radius results to calculate r (K )1/θ for the long-run risk model
specifications from Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Schorfheide et al. (2017), in order
to infer regions of the parameter space where a unique continuation value exists.

4

On the level of techniques, the main innovation in this paper is to combine the idea
in Hansen and Scheinkman (2012) of extracting information on long run dynamics
from the spectral radius of K with the theory of monotone concave operators and
their connections to recursive utility models, as developed in a set of papers referenced below. In particular, we show that a continuous transformation of lifetime
utility per unit of consumption can be expressed as the fixed point of an operator
that combines the linear valuation operator K and a nonlinear component. When
θ < 0 or θ > 1, the nonlinear component is monotone and concave, with either
zero or one nontrivial fixed point. We show that the latter case arises if and only if
r (K )1/θ < 1. For the remaining case 0 < θ < 1, we combine spectral theory with
an extension of Banach’s contraction mapping theorem to establish that a unique
solution exists if and only if the same condition holds.1
Our work builds on a significant literature on solutions to recursive preference
models. The groundwork for studying Epstein–Zin preferences over infinite horizon consumption streams was provided by Epstein and Zin (1989), who in turn
built on the finite-horizon framework of temporal lotteries found in Kreps and
Porteus (1978). Epstein and Zin (1989) obtained sufficient conditions for existence
across a broad set of parameters, while allowing geometric consumption growth
and eschewing a Markov assumption. These findings were strengthened by Marinacci and Montrucchio (2010), who provided sufficient conditions for both existence and uniqueness of solutions, as well as convergence of successive approximations. Their results were obtained via an innovative fixed point approach that
exploits concavity and monotonicity properties possessed by Epstein–Zin preferences with empirically plausible parameterizations.
One issue with the conditions of Epstein and Zin (1989) and Marinacci and Montrucchio (2010) is that they require, at least asymptotically, a finite bound Mc on
1The Krein–Rutman theorem applies to the valuation operator K in our setting, and its spec-

tral radius equals its dominant eigenvalue. Action of K on the corresponding eigenfunction of
the valuation operator is then representative of the long run dynamics induced by K on positive
functions. These objects—the principal eigenpairs of valuation operators associated with future
cash and utility payoffs—have increasingly been used to understand long run risks and long run
values in macroeconomic and financial applications by inducing a decomposition of the stochastic
discount factor (see, e.g., Alvarez and Jermann (2005); Hansen and Scheinkman (2009); Qin and
Linetsky (2017); Christensen (2017b)). In connecting the role of principal eigenpairs of the valuation operator to the theory of monotone concave operators, we link two active strands of research
on present values associated with cash and utility flows.

consumption growth Ct+1 /Ct that holds with probability one. This fails for many
standard consumption processes. One example is Bansal and Yaron (2004), where
ln(Ct+1 /Ct ) = µc + zt + σt ηt+1 .
Here {zt } and {σt } are stationary processes and {ηt+1 } is

In fact the problem is not so much that the bounded growth condition fails, since
the shocks in (5) can be truncated at suitably large values with minimal impact on
the consumption growth process. Rather, the issue is that the resulting restrictions
on parameters, which are used to ensure finiteness of the solution to the recursive
utility model, are excessively conservative. The intuition behind this is that the
probability one bound uniformly restricts utility along every future consumption
trajectory. We obtain sharper results by considering what happens “on average”
across all paths. This strategy is successful because recursive utility specifications,
while nonlinear, are still defined using integration over future continuation values. Hence the whole distribution of the consumption process matters, not just
extreme tail realizations. By applying our results to two empirical set ups from the
recent literature (Bansal and Yaron (2004), Schorfheide et al. (2017)), we demonstrate that the gap between the necessary and sufficient conditions developed here
and the sufficient conditions arising from probability one bounds is both large and
significant for modern quantitative applications.2
In addition to ourselves, a number of other researchers have sought to extend
the work of Epstein and Zin (1989) and Marinacci and Montrucchio (2010). The
idea of exploiting monotonicity and concavity of the Koopmans operator has been
adapted and extended by Balbus (2016), Becker and Rincón-Zapatero (2017), Bloise
and Vailakis (2018) and Marinacci and Montrucchio (2017). While these contributions do not resolve the issues associated with using probability one bounds
on consumption growth discussed above, they do elucidate the links between the

2The preceding discussion should be qualified by the fact that Epstein and Zin (1989) and

Marinacci and Montrucchio (2010) treat a much larger range of state processes than we consider
here. Thus, while our results are sharper for the problems we consider, their studies are more
comprehensive.

monotonicity and concavity properties of certain aggregators and fixed point results in partially ordered vector spaces. Such results also lie at the heart of this
paper and our proofs draw extensively on their ideas.3
Another paper upon which we draw heavily is the study of Epstein–Zin utility models with unbounded consumption growth specifications in Hansen and
Scheinkman (2012), already mentioned above. Their approach is to connect the
solution to the Epstein–Zin utility recursion and the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue
problem associated with a linear operator, denoted in their paper by T, that is proportional to the operator K discussed above. Consumption growth obeys (3) and,
unlike this paper, { Xt } is not required to be compact-valued. In this very general setting they show that a solution exists when a joint restriction holds on the
spectral radius of T and the preference parameters, in addition to certain auxiliary
restrictions. They also obtain a uniqueness result for the case θ > 1.4
In terms of results, the advantage of the conditions in Hansen and Scheinkman
(2012) is the lack of a compactness restriction on Xt . The advantages of our approach are as follows: First, we obtain uniqueness of the solution for all θ, not just
for θ > 1. (One reason this matters is that empirical studies typically find that
θ < 0.) Second, we obtain conditions that are necessary as well as sufficient, both
for existence and for uniqueness. Third, we obtain a globally convergent method
of computation, and show that it converges if and only if a solution exists. Fourth,
the auxiliary conditions in Hansen and Scheinkman (2012), which generalize our
compactness assumption, involve testing integrability restrictions on the eigenfunctions of the operator T. In general these kinds of conditions are difficult to

3Prior to Marinacci and Montrucchio (2010), contributions to the literature on existence and

uniqueness of solutions to recursively defined utility specifications (as well as the closely related
problem of optimality of dynamic programs with general aggregators), were made by Koopmans
(1960), Lucas and Stokey (1984), Becker et al. (1989), Streufert (1990), Boyd (1990), Ozaki and
Streufert (1996), Le Van and Vailakis (2005) and Rincón-Zapatero and Rodrı́guez-Palmero (2007).
Earlier authors used monotonicity and concavity to obtain fixed points of forward looking recursive models with capital and savings choices. See, for example, Coleman (1991), Datta et al. (2002)
and Mirman et al. (2008).

corresponds to θ here.

test, unless, of course, one truncates the state space—which is essentially what we
do here.5
While compactness must be imposed on persistent components of consumption
growth in order to use our conditions, these components are bounded in probability in the applications we consider, and hence one can always choose a compactification of the state space such that the impact on the stochastic process for
consumption is arbitrarily small. Further comments on compactness are given at
the beginning of section 4.
In one final related study, Guo and He (2017) consider an extension to the Epstein–
Zin recursive utility model that includes utility measures for investment gains and
losses. As a part of that study they obtain results for existence, uniqueness and
convergence of solutions to Epstein–Zin recursive utility models with consumption specifications analogous to those in Hansen and Scheinkman (2012), except
that the state space is restricted to be finite. In comparison, we allow for the state
space to be countably or uncountably infinite and we establish not just sufficiency
but also necessity.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 states our main results. Sections 3–4
discuss applications. Section 5 begins the process of providing proofs by developing a set of fixed point results in an abstract setting. Section 6 completes the proofs
by connecting these abstract results to the Epstein–Zin recursive utility setting.
2. M AIN R ESULTS
To maintain focus on results and applications, we first state all findings on existence, uniqueness and convergence of successive approximations for Epstein–Zin
recursive preference models.
2.1. Definitions and Assumptions. Let consumption {Ct } be as defined in (3),
where the state process { Xt } is time homogeneous and Markovian, taking values
in some metric space X. The stochastic kernel for { Xt } will be denoted by Q. In
particular,
Q( x, B) = P{ Xt+1 ∈ B | Xt = x }
5Another recent paper that works in a noncompact state setting is Christensen (2017a). There the

focus is on robust decision makers, who can also be viewed as utility maximizers with risk-sensitive
preferences.

for all x ∈ X and all Borel sets B ⊂ X. The innovation process {Yt } is IID, independent of { Xt }, and takes values in some topological space Y. The common
distribution of each Yt is a Borel probability measure on Y denoted by ν.
Assumption 2.1. X is compact and the growth function κ is continuous.
Let C be all continuous real-valued functions on X and let k · k be the supremum
norm on C . Let C+ be all nonnegative functions in C and let C++ be all strictly
positive functions. A linear operator K from C to itself is called strongly positive if
it maps nonzero elements of C+ into C++ . K is called compact if the image under K
of the unit ball in C is relatively compact. The operator norm and spectral radius of
K are defined by

kK k := sup{kKgk : g ∈ C , k gk 6 1} and r (K ) := lim kK n k1/n
n→∞

respectively.6
2.2. The Fixed Point Problem. Our interest centers on existence, uniqueness and
computability of Vt in (1)–(2). In Hansen and Scheinkman (2012), this is converted
into a fixed point problem by manipulating (1) to yield the forward looking restriction

and θ is as defined in (4). They then seek a Markov solution Wt = w( Xt ) for some
w : X → R.7
One disadvantage of treating (7) directly is that the operation on the right hand
side involves the composition of a nonlinear transformation (taking Wt to the power
θ), a linear transformation (the integral operation embedded in the expectation)
6The spectral radius can alternatively be defined as the supremum of the modulus of elements

of the spectrum of K. These two definitions are equivalent for linear operators on C . In the case
where is finite, the spectral radius of K reduces to maxλ |λ|, where λ ranges over the eigenvalues
of K. See, for example, Kolmogorov and Fomin (1975).

on R+ , then (9) can be written more concisely as g = Ag, where A is the operator
defined at g ∈ C+ by
Ag( x ) = φ(Kg( x )).

(12)

Note that A is the composition of two maps: the linear but infinite dimensional
operator K and the nonlinear but one dimensional function φ. The fact that nonlinear structure is isolated in φ is exploited extensively in the proofs. In doing so we
adopt the convention 0α = ∞ and ∞α = 0 whenever α < 0. In particular, φ(0) = 0
when θ < 0.
Assumption 2.2. K is a strongly positive compact linear operator from C to itself.
Assumption 2.2 holds in all applications we consider. The following examples help
illustrate. Linearity is not discussed since K is obviously linear on C .
Example 2.1. Suppose that X ⊂ Rn and Q( x, dx 0 ) = q( x, x 0 )dx 0 for some continuR
ous positive function q. Then K is an integral operator Kg( x ) = g( x 0 )k( x, x 0 )dx 0
with kernel

k ( x, x ) := β

Z

exp[(1 − γ)κ ( x 0 , y0 , x )]ν(dy0 )q( x, x 0 ).

10

Evidently Kg is strictly positive whenever g is nonnegative and nonzero. Joint
continuity of k combined with compactness of X implies compactness of K as a
linear operator on C .8 Hence assumption 2.2 is valid.
Example 2.2. Consider the setting of example 2.1, except that X is finite, endowed
with the discrete topology, and q is a density with respect to the counting measure
instead of Lebesgue measure (i.e., q is a stochastic matrix). In this setting all linear
operators are compact, so the conditions of assumption 2.2 are again satisfied. The
linear operator K can be represented as a matrix with strictly positive entries acting on a space of vectors, and the Perron–Frobenius theorem for strictly positive
matrices implies that r (K ) is equal to the largest eigenvalue of K.
In seeking fixed points of A we need only consider elements of C++ . While g = 0
is a fixed point of A when θ < 0, this corresponds to the solution Gt ≡ 0, for all
t, which, in view of Wt = Gt1/θ indicates infinite utility—a trivial solution for the
recursive utility problem. Moreover, if g ∈ C+ and g is not everywhere zero, then
Ag is strictly positive by assumption 2.2. Hence only in C++ can nontrivial fixed
points exist.
For fixed points of A on C++ we have the following result:
Theorem 2.1. When assumptions 2.1–2.2 hold, the following statements are equivalent:
(a) r (K )1/θ < 1.
(b) A has a fixed point in C++ .
(c) There exists a g ∈ C++ such that { An g}n>1 is convergent in C++ .
(d) A has a unique fixed point in C++ .
(e) A has a unique fixed point g∗ in C++ and An g → g∗ as n → ∞ for any g in C++ .
1/(1−γ)

In any one of the above cases, Gt = g∗ ( Xt ) solves (8) and Vt := Ct Gt
the Epstein–Zin recursion (1).

solves

Regarding the proof of theorem 2.1, observe that A is monotone, being the composition of two monotone increasing maps φ and K. Moreover, φ is concave whenever θ < 0 or θ > 1. Since K is linear, the operator A is likewise concave in both
of these settings. In general, monotone increasing concave operators have unique

positive fixed points when their iterates neither collapse to zero nor diverge to infinity. These asymptotics depend on the spectral radius of K. For the remaining
case 0 < θ < 1 we use a contraction mapping argument, where contraction is required eventually, rather than in the first step. Again, this low frequency property
is controlled by the spectral radius r (K ). Sections 5–6 provide further details. An
interpretation of the condition r (K )1/θ < 1 in terms of intertemporal preferences is
given in section 2.3.9
There are two interesting implications of theorem 2.1 not previously discussed.
One is that, if a solution exists, then, since (b) implies (d), a unique solution exists.
In other words, at most one solution exists for every parameterization, and hence
uniqueness is never problematic.
Another interesting implication is that, since (c) is equivalent to both (d) and (e),
convergence of successive approximations from any starting point in C+ implies
that a unique solution exists and this solution is equal to the limit of the successive
approximations from every initial condition. Thus, if computing the solution to
the model at a given set of parameters is the primary objective, then convergence
of the iterative method itself justifies the claim that the limit is a solution, and no
other solution exists in the candidate space C+ .
2.3. Evaluation and Interpretation. To test the conditions of theorem 2.1, it is necessary to calculate the test value r (K )1/θ , which involves the spectral radius of the
operator K defined in (10). For this purpose we adapt a result concerning the local spectral radius of positive operators originally due to V. Ya. Stet’senko (see the
proof of proposition 2.2 below). In doing so we also obtain a more natural interpretation of our key condition. In all of what follows we adopt the notation

9In Hansen and Scheinkman (2012) and Guo and He (2017), the condition r (K )1/θ < 1 is ex-

pressed in different notation but the corresponding condition (e.g., Assumption 3 in Hansen and
Scheinkman (2012)) is in each case equivalent, modulo the different function spaces and hence the
definition of the spectral radius.

12

The term R [C ] represents the risk-adjusted (certainty equivalent) long-run mean
consumption growth rate.
Proposition 2.2. If assumptions 2.1–2.2 hold, then r (K )1/θ = β R [C ]1−1/ψ .
Condition (a) in theorem 2.1 can now be written as
β R [C ]1−1/ψ < 1.

(14)

The spectral radius condition thus separates the contributions of time discounting
β, intratemporal risk adjustment of the consumption stream embedded in R [C ],
and intertemporal substitutability of consumption ψ to the valuation of the consumption stream.
More impatience (a lower β) always makes it more likely that (14) holds. Higher
intratemporal risk adjustment γ decreases R [C ] but its impact on our condition
depends on the EIS parameter. When preferences are elastic (ψ > 1), the income
effect of a higher value of future consumption arising from an increase in R [C ] is
stronger than the change in the marginal rate of substitution between current and
future consumption. Since Wt is denominated in utils per unit of current consumption, it increases and diverges to +∞ as R [C ] increases. The relative strength of the
income and substitution effect switches when ψ < 1, and r (K )1/θ < 1 is violated
when R [C ] is sufficiently low.
Finally, details of the dynamics of the consumption growth process (for instance,
its persistence or higher moments of its innovations) matter for our condition only
through the long run distribution of consumption growth encoded in R [C ].
2.4. Connection to Tests Using Almost Sure Bounds. The preceding discussion
facilitates comparison between theorem 2.1 and the tests for existence and uniqueness of continuation values in Epstein and Zin (1989) and Marinacci and Montrucchio (2010). In particular, theorem 3.1 of Epstein and Zin (1989) shows that a
solution to the recursive utility problem exists whenever ψ > 1 and

Hence the spectral radius based condition in (14) is always weaker. Moreover,
the inequality in (16) is strict whenever shocks are non-degenerate, and the gap
between the conditions turns out to be large in the quantitative applications we
consider (see section 4).
3. A PPLICATION I: C ONSUMPTION W ITH A D ETERMINISTIC T IME T REND

Here π is a distribution concentrated on [ a, b] ⊂ R for some positive scalars a < b.
We now show that the stability coefficient from theorem 2.1 can be calculated analytically when (17) holds. We then demonstrate how the result we obtain improves
upon the stability condition presented in Alvarez and Jermann (2005).
When consumption obeys (17), Alvarez and Jermann (2005) show that a unique

10The fixed point of the functional equation solved by Alvarez and Jermann (2005) is equal to

g1/θ + 1 in our notation, where g solves (9) with ζ := 1. The conditions for existence and uniqueness
are identical in each case.

14

This condition is weaker than (18), since the maximized term in (18) exceeds unity.
To understand the difference between the two conditions, observe that (18) and
(19) are identical apart from the fact that (19) replaces θ with nθ and takes the limit.
This difference arises because the condition from Alvarez and Jermann (2005) enforces contraction in one step. In contrast, the condition β R [C ]1−1/ψ < 1 used in
this paper is an asymptotic condition that ignores short-run fluctuations in consumption. This leads to a weaker condition because short-run fluctuations do not
impinge on asymptotic outcomes.

4. A PPLICATION II: L ONG -R UN R ISK
Next we turn to two specifications from recent empirical studies and apply theorem 2.1. Since the spectral radius based condition in theorem 2.1 is necessary and
sufficient, the outcome determines exactly which parameterizations are stable and
which are unstable in a given application. In the stable case r (K )1/θ < 1, a unique
solution exists. In the unstable case r (K )1/θ > 1, no solution exists. To give some
basis for comparison, we also investigate when the sufficient condition of Epstein
and Zin (1989) holds, as given in equation (15).
The test of Epstein and Zin (1989) assumes that consumption growth is bounded.
In order to apply it we truncate the stationary distribution of consumption growth
at its 95th percentile. While other percentiles can also be considered, our main
conclusion is that the probability one tests are too strict in the applications we consider, in the sense that many stable parameterizations fail to meet their conditions.
This conclusion is further strengthened if higher percentiles are used to truncate
consumption growth. On the other hand, lower percentiles open an increasingly
significant gap between the theoretical model and the truncated version.
For the spectral radius based test, the state space must be compact before theorem 2.1 applies. This requires truncating the innovations to the state process in the
specifications below. In fact a weak truncation occurs automatically when we implement the models on a computer, with R [C ] in (13) calculated by simulating over
consumption paths and taking the (risk adjusted) average. For paths implemented
in this way, truncation is inherent, with bounds equal to the smallest and largest

floating point numbers that can be implemented on a machine of given precision.11

4.1. Bansal–Yaron Consumption Dynamics. Suppose first that consumption growth
obeys the Bansal and Yaron (2004) specification
ln(Ct+1 /Ct ) = µc + zt + σt ηc,t+1 ,
σt2+1

zt+1 = ρzt + φz σt ηz,t+1 ,
n
o

= max v σt + d + φσ ησ,t+1 , 0 .

Here {ηi,t } are IID and standard normal for i ∈ {c, z, σ}. The Markov state for
consumption growth is given by Xt = (zt , σt ).
We calculate the spectral radius based test value r (K )1/θ associated with these dynamics, as well as the test of Epstein and Zin (1989) discussed in section 2.4.12 The
parameterization is as given in Bansal and Yaron (2004), where the preference parameters are set to γ = 10.0, β = 0.998 and ψ = 1.5. Here and in all subsequent
cases ζ = 1 − β. The parameters in the consumption process are µc = 0.0015,
ρ = 0.979, φz = 0.044, v = 0.987, d =7.9092e-7 and φσ =2.3e-6.
Evaluating the Epstein and Zin (1989) test value on the left hand side of (15) at
these parameters using the methodology described above yields 1.003. At the same
time, r (K )1/θ evaluates to 0.9983. Hence, by theorem 2.1, a unique solution exists.
This tells us (i) that the solution to the Bansal–Yaron specification is well-defined,
unique and can be computed from any initial condition in C+ by successive approximation, and (ii) that the probability one condition of Epstein and Zin (1989)
is too strict to effectively treat this model.
11With standard 64 bit double precision floating point integers, truncation takes place at

±1.8 × 10308 . The amount of probability mass outside this range is infinitesimally small. Aside
from Monte Carlo methods for evaluating (33), we also experimented with projection methods
and discretization methods. These computations were slower to run and implement but generated
almost identical results.
12Since consumption growth is in fact unbounded in this model, to obtain finite M in (15) we
c
restrict it by truncating the stationary distribution of consumption growth at the 95th percentile, as
discussed above.

Figure 1a further illustrates the same point by showing the value of the expression on the left hand side of (15) at the Bansal–Yaron parameterization and also at
neighboring parameterizations obtained by varying ψ and µc . Almost all values
exceed unity, indicating failure of the test, apart from a small measure of parameterizations to the left of the 1.0 contour line. Nonetheless, most of these models
are in fact stable, with a unique, globally attracting solution. This is true because,

17

as shown in figure 1b, only for combinations of a very high average growth rate
and high intertemporal elasticity of substitution do we find parameterizations with
r (K )1/θ > 1.
4.2. Schorfheide–Song–Yaron Consumption Dynamics. Next consider the consumption specification adopted in Schorfheide et al. (2017), where
ln(Ct+1 /Ct ) = µc + zt + σc,t ηc,t+1 ,
q
zt+1 = ρ zt + 1 − ρ2 σz,t ηz,t+1 ,
σi,t = φi σ̄ exp(hi,t )

with

hi,t+1 = ρhi hi + σhi ηhi ,t+1 ,

i ∈ {c, z}.

The innovations {ηc,t } and {ηhi ,t } are IID and standard normal for i ∈ {c, z}. The
state can be represented as Xt = (σc,t , σz,t , zt ).
In Schorfheide et al. (2017), the preference parameters are calibrated to be γ = 8.89,
β = 0.999 and ψ = 1.97, while the parameters in the consumption process are
µc = 0.0016, ρ = 0.987, φz = 0.215, σ̄ = 0.0032, φc = 1.0, ρhz = 0.992, σh2z =
0.0039, ρhc = 0.991, and σh2c = 0.0096. Following procedures analogous to those
used for the model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), we find that the left hand side of
(15) evaluates to 1.003. Thus, the sufficient condition for existence based on the
probability one bound fails to hold. At the same time, by calculations analogous
to those used to compute the spectral radius in the Bansal and Yaron (2004) case,
we find that r (K )1/θ = 0.9995. It follows that a unique solution does exist, by
theorem 2.1.
Figures 2a–2b illustrate further by repeating the exercise of examining the tests
at neighboring parameterizations. The results are similar to those obtained for the
Bansal–Yaron parameterization: The probability one based test is too conservative,
excluding many parameterizations that do in fact have unique, well-defined solutions. A similar outcome is observed in figures 3a–3b, when β is varied instead of
µc .

on C and let k · k be the supremum norm. Note that C is a Banach lattice with this
norm and partial order.13
The symbol  denotes strict pointwise inequality, so that f  g means f ( x ) <
g( x ) for all x ∈ X. The statement f < g means that f 6 g and f ( x ) < g( x ) for
13In particular, the metric induced by k · k on C is complete, C is closed under the taking of

pairwise suprema and | f | 6 | g| implies k f k 6 k gk for all f , g in C . See Zaanen (1997) for details.

20

some x ∈ X. Given f 6 g in C , let

[ f , g ] : = { h ∈ C : f 6 h 6 g }.
The positive cone of C , denoted below by C+ , is all g ∈ C such that 0 6 g. As an
order cone in C , the set C+ is solid, normal and reproducing.14 The interior of C+
is denoted C++ and contains all g ∈ C with 0  g. An operator A from C0 ⊂ C
into C is called increasing if A f 6 Ag whenever f , g ∈ C0 and f 6 g. It is called
concave if C0 is convex and, for all α ∈ [0, 1] and f , g ∈ C0 ,
αA f + (1 − α) Ag 6 A{α f + (1 − α) g}.

(20)

For a linear operator L from C to itself, the operator norm, spectral radius, and
properties of compactness and strong positivity, are as defined in section 2.1. Note
that, for any increasing linear map L on C we have | L f | 6 L| f | for every f ∈ C .
A map F from some C0 ⊂ C to itself is called globally asymptotically stable if F has
a unique fixed point w∗ in C0 and F n w converges to w∗ from any w ∈ C0 . We will
exploit the following fixed point theorem for monotone concave operators, which
is implied by corollary 2.1.1 of Zhang (2013) and the fact that C+ is both normal
and solid in C :
Theorem 5.1 (Du–Zhang). Let A be increasing and concave on C+ . If, in addition,
there exist functions f 1 6 f 2 in C+ with A f 1  f 1 and A f 2 6 f 2 , then A is globally
asymptotically stable on [ f 1 , f 2 ].
5.2. Set Up. Let K : C → C be an increasing linear operator and let φ : R+ → R+
be continuous. Let Φ be the operator on C+ defined by Φg = φ ◦ g. Let A be the
operator on C+ defined by A = Φ ◦ K, or, equivalently,

( Ag)( x ) = φ(Kg( x ))

( x ∈ X).

(21)

(In what follows, compositions such as Φ ◦ K are written more simply as ΦK.) Note
that AC+ ⊂ C+ . Indeed, given that K is linear and increasing, for each fixed g ∈ C+
we have Kg ∈ C+ . Since φ is continuous and nonnegative, Φ Kg is also in C+ .
Below we consider fixed points of A in C+ under a range of auxiliary assumptions.
Assumptions placed on K and φ in this section are always in force.
14A cone C in C is called solid if it has nonempty interior, normal if there exists a constant N with

k f k 6 N k gk whenever f , g ∈ C with f 6 g, and reproducing if every element f of C can be written
as a linear combination of elements of C. See, for example, Du (2006).

21

5.3. Long Run Contractions. We begin with a long run contraction result that uses
the following Lipschitz bound:

|φ(s) − φ(t)| 6 ` |s − t| for all s, t > 0.

(22)

Proposition 5.2. If (22) holds for some ` > 0 and r (K ) < 1/`, then there exists an
n ∈ N such that An is a contraction on C+ . In particular, A is globally asymptotically
stable.
Proof of proposition 5.2. Fix f , g ∈ C+ . As a first step we claim that

| An f − An g| 6 (`K )n | f − g|

(23)

holds pointwise on X for all integers n > 0. It holds for n = 0, since A0 and K0 are
by definition identity maps. Now suppose that it holds for some n > 0. We claim
it also holds at n + 1. Indeed
An+1 f − An+1 g = |ΦK An f − ΦK An g| 6 ` |KAn f − KAn g| ,
where the inequality is due to (22). Using this bound and the linearity and monotonicity of K leads us to
An+1 f − An+1 g 6 ` |K ( An f − An g)| 6 `K | An f − An g| 6 (`K )n+1 | f − g|,
where the last inequality uses the induction hypothesis combined with the monotonicity of K. We have now confirmed that (23) holds for all n > 0.
Taking the supremum over (23) yields k An f − An gk 6 k(`K )n | f − g|k. The definition of the operator norm then gives

k An f − An gk 6 k(`K )n k · k f − gk = `n kK n k · k f − gk.
From the definition r (K ) = limn→∞ kK n k1/n , we have

(`n kK n k)1/n → `r (K ) < 1.
Hence, for sufficiently large n, the map An is a contraction with modulus `n kK n k.
All claims in proposition 5.2 follow from this property, completeness of k · k, the
fact that C+ is closed in C , and a well-known extension to the Banach contraction
mapping theorem (see, e.g., p. 272 of Wagner (1982)).

22

5.4. Fixed Points under Monotonicity and Concavity. If φ(0) = 0, then 0 ∈ C+
is clearly a fixed point of A. In applications this fixed point is often trivial, and
interest centers on positive fixed points. In such settings it turns out that notions
of concavity and monotonicity are more helpful than contractivity arguments for
establishing fixed point results. We begin with a simple lemma.
Lemma 5.3. For the operator A = ΦK defined above, the following statements hold.
(a) If φ is increasing on R+ , then A is increasing on C+ .
(b) If φ is concave on R+ , then A is concave on C+ .
Proof. Claim (a) is obviously true, given that K is already assumed to be increasing.
Regarding claim (b), since K is linear, for any fixed f , g ∈ C+ , x ∈ X, and α ∈ [0, 1],
we have
αφ(K f ( x )) + (1 − α)φ(Kg( x )) 6 φ(αK f ( x ) + (1 − α)Kg( x ))

= φ[K (α f ( x ) + (1 − α) g( x ))].
In other words, αA f ( x ) + (1 − α) Ag( x ) 6 A[α f ( x ) + (1 − α) g( x )] for any x ∈ X,
as was to be shown.

Lemma 5.4. If φ is strictly concave, K is strongly positive, and, in addition,
φ(0) = 0,

lim
t ↓0

φ(t)
6 1 and
t

r (K ) 6 1,

(24)

then the only fixed point of A in C+ is 0.
Proof. Since K is linear we have K0 = 0. Hence φ(0) = 0 implies A0 = 0. Thus, the
zero element is a fixed point. It remains to show that no other fixed point exists
in C+ . In doing so we use the fact that φ must be strictly positive everywhere on
(0, ∞), since the existence of a positive t with φ(t) = 0 violates our assumption
that φ is both strictly concave and nonnegative.
Seeking a contradiction, suppose that g ∈ C+ is a nonzero fixed point of A. Observe that, since Ag = g and g is nonzero, the fact that K is a strongly positive
operator and φ is positive on (0, ∞) implies that g  0. In particular, the constant
m := min g is strictly positive. Let η := φ(m)/m. Note that, by strict concavity of
φ(t)
φ and the assumption that t → 1 as t ↓ 0, we have
η<1

and

φ(t) 6 ηt whenever t > m.

(25)

23

Observe that Kg  g must hold. To see why, suppose that Kg( x ) 6 g( x ) for some
x. Invoking strict concavity and the limit in (24) again, we have φ(t) < t for any
positive t, and hence Ag( x ) = φ(Kg( x )) < Kg( x ) 6 g( x ). This contradicts the
assumption that g is a fixed point of A. Our claim that Kg  g is confirmed.
Next we claim that An g 6 (ηK )n g for all n. Evidently this holds at n = 0, and,
assuming it holds at n, we have
An+1 g = ΦKAn g 6 ηKAn g 6 ηK (ηK )n g = (ηK )n+1 g.
In the first inequality we used the fact that Kg  g and g is a fixed point of A, so
that KAn g = Kg  g > m when m is as given in (25). In the second inequality we
used the induction hypothesis and the monotonicity of K.
We have now shown by induction that An g 6 (ηK )n g for all n ∈ N. Hence

k An gk 6 η n kK n gk 6 η n kK n k k gk

(26)

for all n. Since r (K ) 6 1 and η < 1, the definition of r (K ) implies existence of an
n ∈ N such that kK n k1/n < 1/η, or kK n k < (1/η )n . Evaluating (26) at this n gives
k An gk < k gk, contradicting our assumption that g is a fixed point of A.

Below we will make use of the following version of the Krein–Rutman theorem,
the value of which for studying recursive preference models was identified and
illustrated in Hansen and Scheinkman (2009, 2012).
Lemma 5.5 (Krein–Rutman). If, in addition to being linear and increasing, K is also
strongly positive and compact, then r (K ) > 0 and r (K ) is an eigenvalue of K. In particular, there exists an e ∈ C+ such that Ke = r (K )e, and e  0.
Lemma 5.5 follows directly from theorem 1.2 of Du (2006), given that C+ is both
solid and reproducing. The element e in lemma 5.5 is unique up to a scale factor.
In what follows we normalize by requiring that kek = 1, and call e the Perron–
Frobenius eigenfunction of K.
Lemma 5.6. If K is strongly positive and compact, and φ and K jointly satisfy
lim
t ↓0

φ(t)
r (K ) > 1 and
t

lim
t↑∞

φ(t)
r (K ) < 1,
t

then there exist positive constants c1 < c2 with the following properties:
(a) If 0 < c 6 c1 and f = ce, then f  A f .

(27)

24

(b) If c2 6 c < ∞ and f = ce, then A f  f .
Proof. Let λ := r (K ). Since K is strongly positive and compact, the Perron–Frobenius
eigenfunction e discussed above is well defined. Regarding claim (a), observe that,
in view of (27), there exists an e > 0 such that
φ(t)
λ>1
t

whenever

0 < t < e.

Choosing c1 such that 0 < c1 < e/λ and c 6 c1 , we have cλe( x ) 6 c1 λkek = c1 λ <
e, and hence
Ace( x ) = φ(cKe( x )) = φ(cλe( x )) =

φ(cλe( x ))
cλe( x ) > ce( x ).
cλe( x )

Since x ∈ X was arbitrary, the first claim in the lemma is verified.
Turning to claim (b) and using again the hypotheses in (27), we can choose a finite
M such that
φ(t)
λ < 1 whenever M < t.
t
Let m be the minimum of e on X. Since X is compact and e  0, we have m > 0.
Let c2 be a constant strictly greater than max{ M/(λm), c1 } and let c lie in [c2 , ∞).
By the definition of m we have cλe( x ) > c2 λe( x ) > M for all x ∈ X, from which it
follows that
φ(cλe( x ))
λce( x ) < ce( x ).
Ace( x ) = φ(cλe( x )) =
cλe( x )
By construction, 0 < c1 < c2 , so all claims are now established.

Proposition 5.7. Let K be strongly positive and compact, and let the conditions in (27)
hold. If, in addition, φ is increasing and concave, then A is globally asymptotically stable
on C++ .
Proof. Given that φ is increasing and concave on R+ , lemma 5.3 implies that A is
increasing and concave on C+ . Since lemma 5.6 implies existence of a pair f 1 , f 2
such that A f 1  f 1 and A f 2 6 f 2 , and since the function f 1 can be chosen from
C++ , theorem 5.1 implies that A has a fixed point g∗ in C++ .
Next we claim that

∀ g ∈ C++ , ∃ f 1 , f 2 ∈ C++ such that f 1 6 g, g∗ 6 f 2 , A f 1  f 1 and A f 2 6 f 2 .
(28)

25

To see this, fix g ∈ C++ . Since g  0 and X is compact, g attains a finite maximum
and strictly positive minimum on X. The same is true of the existing fixed point
g∗ and the Perron–Frobenius eigenfunction e. Hence, we can choose constants a1
and a2 such that 0  a1 e 6 g∗ , g 6 a2 e. With a1 chosen sufficiently small and a2
sufficiently large, lemma 5.6 implies that a1 e  A( a1 e) and A( a2 e)  a2 e. Thus
(28) holds.
Turning to uniqueness, let g∗∗ be a second fixed point of A in C++ . By (28) there
exist f 1 , f 2 ∈ C++ such that f 1 6 g∗∗ , g∗ 6 f 2 with f 1  A f 1 and A f 2  f 2 . By
theorem 5.1, the interval [ f 1 , f 2 ] contains only one fixed point. Thus, g∗ = g∗∗ .
Finally, regarding convergence, let g be an element of C++ . Invoking (28) establishes the existence of f 1 , f 2  0 such that f 1 6 g, g∗ 6 f 2 with f 1  A f 1 and
A f 2  f 2 . By theorem 5.1, every element of [ f 1 , f 2 ] converges to g∗ under iteration
of A. In particular, An g → g∗ as n → ∞.

Now we turn to the specific operator A given in (12), with φ defined as before by
n
oθ
φ(t) = ζ + t1/θ

(29)

and K is as given in (10). Our aim is to establish the claims in theorem 2.1 using
the abstract fixed point results from section 5.
To establish theorem 2.1, it suffices to show that ( a) =⇒ (e) =⇒ (d) =⇒ (c) =⇒
(b) =⇒ ( a). Of these, (e) =⇒ (d) and (d) =⇒ (c) are obvious (for (d) =⇒ (c),
just take g to be the fixed point). We now prove the remainder.
(( a) =⇒ (e) when θ < 0). Suppose that r (K )θ < 1, or, equivalently, r (K ) > 1. We
need to show that A is globally asymptotically stable on C++ , for which it suffices
that the conditions of proposition 5.7 hold. The operator K is strongly positive
by assumption. Given that θ < 0, the map φ is strictly increasing and strictly
concave on R+ . Thus, we need only show that the two inequalities in (27) are
valid. Regarding the first inequality, we have
φ(t)
=

↑ 1 as t ↓ 0.

26

Since r (K ) > 1, the first inequality holds. Regarding the second inequality in (27),
evidently φ(t)/t → 0 as t → ∞, so this bound certainly holds. The proof of (e) is
therefore complete.
(( a) =⇒ (e) when θ > 0). Suppose first that θ ∈ (0, 1). The conditions of
proposition 5.2 are then satisfied, since r (K ) < 1 by assumption and φ is Lipschitz
of order 1. From this proposition we see that A is globally asymptotically stable
on C+ , with a unique fixed point g∗ . This fixed point lies in C++ , since 0 is not a
fixed point of A (because A0 = φ(K0) = φ(0) > 0), and, moreover, if g∗ is nonzero
then Kg∗ is strictly positive, and hence so is Ag∗ = ΦKg∗ . Thus, A is also globally
asymptotically stable on C++ . Hence (e) is valid.
Now consider the remaining case θ > 1, while continuing to assume that r (K ) < 1.
For such θ the function φ is increasing and concave, and, since r (K ) < 1, the conditions in (27) are both satisfied. Hence proposition 5.7 applies, and A is globally
asymptotically stable on C++ . Hence (e) holds
((c) =⇒ (b)). Let g ∈ C++ be such that { An g} is convergent in C++ , with limit
denoted by ḡ. Evidently A is continuous, being the composition of continuous
mappings.15 Thus, A ḡ = A(limn→∞ An g) = limn→∞ An+1 g = ḡ. In particular, ḡ is
a fixed point of A.
((b) =⇒ ( a) when θ < 0). Suppose to the contrary that r (K ) 6 1. To show that A
has no fixed point in C++ , recall lemma 5.4. We have r (K ) 6 1 by assumption and
the other conditions (24) have already been checked. Hence lemma 5.4 applies,
and A has no fixed point in C++ .
((b) =⇒ ( a) when θ > 0). First we make some observations about φ(t) = (ζ +
t1/θ )θ on R+ when θ > 0. Evidently φ is continuous and increasing with φ(t) > t
for all t ∈ R+ . It is not difficult to see that, in addition,
φ(t)

and
lim φn (t) = ∞, ∀ t > 0.

Now suppose that A has a fixed point g ∈ C++ and yet r (K ) > 1. Let e be the
Perron–Frobenius eigenfunction of K and let c be a positive constant such that ec :=
ce 6 g. Such a c exists because minx∈X g( x ) is strictly positive and maxx∈X e( x ) is
finite. Let t0 be a positive constant such that ec 6 t0 on X. We claim that
0 6 s 6 t =⇒ φ(s) >

∀n ∈ N, An ec >

ec on X.

15Here we are using the fact that K is a compact operator and hence continuous.

To see this, observe that (31) holds at n = 0. Now suppose that (31) holds at some
n > 0. We then have

Here the first inequality is by the induction hypothesis, the monotonicity of φ and
K and the linearity of K. The second is from r (K ) > 1, which gives Kec = cKe =
cr (K )e > ce = ec . Using ec ( x ) 6 t0 and the first property in (30), we have

Thus, the statement in (31) is valid.
From (31) and the second property in (30) we conclude that An ec diverges to +∞.
Moreover, the fixed point g satisfies g > ec , so An g > An ec . Hence An g eventually
exceeds g, contradicting our assumption that g is a fixed point of A.
The proof of theorem 2.1 is now done.

A PPENDIX
It remains to complete the proof of proposition 2.2:
Proof of proposition 2.2. Theorem 9.1 of Krasnosel’skii et al. (2012) shows that if L is
a linear operator that leaves a solid normal order cone invariant, then
r ( L) = lim k Ln gk1/n
n→∞

(32)

whenever g lies in the interior of that cone. Since the positive cone C+ of C is
both solid and normal, and since the operator K is strongly positive, we can apply
(32) to the interior element g = 1 ≡ 1 to obtain r (K ) = limn→∞ kK n 1k1/n . A
straightforward inductive argument shows that

We have now shown that r (K ) is equal to the right hand side of (33), which is
equivalent to the claim in proposition 2.2.
