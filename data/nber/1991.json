    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the interaction between consumer durable goods and\nconsumer non-durable goods in determining the responsiveness of total\nexpenditure to the after-tax real interest rate. The introduction of\nconsumer durables into the consumer's decision problem can have important\neffects on the interest elasticity of total spending. The channel\nhighlighted here might be called the \"user cost effect,\" in that the\nafter-tax interest rate enters the implicit user cost of consumer durable\ngoods. Even if a consumer has a one-period planning horizon, possibly\nbecause of a binding borrowing constraint, the user cost effect may\nnonetheless make his spending highly interest sensitive. Finally, the\npaper examines the response of the level and composition of consumer\nspending to the high real interest rates experienced in the early 1980s.\n\n",
