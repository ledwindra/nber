    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze the design of recommendations (available to all shareholders) and research reports (available only to subscribers) by a proxy advisor, who maximizes profits from selling information to shareholders. We show that the advisor benefits from biasing its recommendations against the a priori more likely alternative, thereby \u201ccreating controversy\u201d for the vote. In contrast, it serves the advisor\u2019s interest to produce precise and unbiased research reports. Our results help reinterpret empirical patterns of shareholders\u2019 voting behavior, suggesting that proxy advisors\u2019 recommendations may not be a suitable benchmark for evaluating shareholders\u2019 votes. Our model also rationalizes the one-size-fits-all approach in recommendations.\n\n",
