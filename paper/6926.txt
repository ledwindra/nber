1 INTRODUCTION

        A large industry involved in the forecasting of key macroeconomic variables, such as gross

national product, inflation rates, interest rates and industrial production, has arisen over the past

three decades. These forecasts, produced by independent financial analysts, bank research

departments, and the like, more often than not incorporate subjective judgements. Consequently,

academic economists have typically looked askance at such forecasts, and have relied instead on

time series and other econometric methods to make conditional forecasts. Yet given the weight

place by professional traders and policy makers on such judgement-based forecasts, it is important

to know exactly what information is contained within these forecasts.

        In this paper, we assess a hitherto neglected aspect of the time series properties of the

ASA-NBER forecasts. In particular, we examine whether forecasts exhibit a weak form of

rationality, termed "consistency", which fulfills the following conditions: (i) the actual and forecast

series are integrated of the same order; (ii) they are cointegrated, and; (iii) the cointegrating

vector is consistent with long run unitary elasticity of expectations with respect to the actual

series. Each of these conditions is increasingly more stringent than the one preceding it. Clearly, if

one series in a pair is an integrated process and the other is a trend stationary one, then over time

such series must drift infinitely far apart. If condition (i) is fulfilled, but condition (ii) is not, then

once again these two series will drift apart. Finally, the forecast and the actual series could be

cointegrated, but the long-run elasticity of the forecast with respect to the exchange rate could be

different than unity. In the absence of measurement error, no sensible forecast should behave thus,

since it implies that the forecast does not move one for one with the actual series, even in the long

        Typically, when examining forecast accuracy researchers examine the mean, variance and

serial correlation properties of the forecast errors. The issues of integration and cointegration are

rarely addressed (with exceptions cited below). Yet these issues can be very important, as pointed

out in Clements and Hendry (1993, 1994). They observe that the root mean squared prediction

error (RMSE) yields different forecast rankings depending upon whether the evaluation is

conducted in levels or differences. Bonham and Cohen (1995), in a slightly different context, also

argue that ignoring aspects of stationarity may lead to improper inferences regarding the

rationality of forecasts. (Moreover, the usual criteria ignores distinctions of permanent versus

transitory movements which are critical to characterizations of macro time series.) We also

examine whether forecasts respond to disequilibria, such as estimated error correction terms, or

prediction errors.

        We conduct this examination in the following manner. In section 2, we review the

literature and discuss the characteristics of the survey forecast data used in this study. In section

3, the tests for integration, cointegration, and for coefficient restrictions are described. Section 4

reports the empirical results of these tests using the final (revised) series. Section 5 discusses the

interpretation of error correction specifications for forecasts (implied by cointegration), and the

empirical results. Section 6 repeats the exercise for the initially reported (unrevised) series.

Section 7 concludes.

     The usage of "consistency" here is different from that in econometrics, where it denotes
convergence in probability, a concept that involves the property of the estimator when the sample
size approaches infinity. A companion paper to this one, involving structural exchange rate
forecasts, is Cheung and Chinn (1998).

2 STUDIES OF FORECAST RATIONALITY

2.1 Previous Literature

        Survey data are generally viewed with suspicion by economists, even more so as the

rational expectations approach to macroeconomics has come to dominate economic discourse.

The skepticism is borne of desire to infer preferences from actions, rather than statements.

Unfortunately, as most glaringly made obvious by the exchange rate literature, rational

expectations measures of expectations have their own limitations (see Froot and Thaler, 1990).

Consequently, macroeconomists have long resorted to various survey measures such as the

Livingstone survey of inflationary expectations. Several recent studies have found that survey data

do contain useful information about future events.2 Typically, in assessing the rationality of these

survey-based forecasts, the usual metrics have been used -- mean error, root mean squared error,

and mean absolute error. A good example of this approach is Zarnowitz and Braun (1993).

        Recently, Aggarwal, Mohanty and Song (1995) have assessed the unbiasedness and

integration and cointegration characteristics of macroeconomic data and their respective forecasts,

published by Money Market Services (MMS). However, they -- like Liu and Maddala (1992) in

their examination of MMS exchange rate forecasts -- impose a unitary elasticity of forecasts with

respect to actual series; in contrast, our modeling approach is more flexible, allowing for

cointegration without necessarily imposing these constraints. Hence we can test for whether the

restriction is rejected or not.3 Moreover, all of these previous studies use inefficient tests for either

Runkle, 1990.

     Other papers directly addressing this issue of integration and cointegration include Fischer
(1989) for M1, and Lahiri and Chun (1989) for GNP, the price deflator and the unemployment

                                                   3
integration or cointegration, or for both. In contrast, we apply more powerful unit root tests

corrected for small sample effects, and the Johansen and Juselius (1990) multivariate

cointegration testing procedure which is more efficient than other testing procedures.

       In assessing the forecast characteristics, we also carefully distinguish between the initial

unrevised series, and the subsequently revised, final series. Presumably, the forecasters are

attempting to predict the former. Hence, comparisons of forecasts and actual revised series, as in

many previous studies, is unlikely to provide an accurate picture of forecast rationality.

2.2 The ASA-NBER Survey of Forecasters

       Since 1968, the American Statistical Association (ASA) and the National Bureau of

Economic Research (NBER) have jointly undertaken a survey of macroeconomic forecasters.

Over time, the series surveyed as well as the respondents, have varied. However, taken together,

these forecasts comprise the most extensive and longest uninterrupted set of series available. A

detailed discussion of the coverage and characteristics of the ASA-NBER forecast surveys is

provided by Zarnowitz and Braun (1993).

       The ASA-NBER database includes forecasts of industrial production, the GNP deflator,

real GNP, housing starts, the CPI inflation rate, the 3 month treasury bill rate, the yield on

corporate bonds, nominal after tax corporate profits, and the rate of unemployment.

       We obtained the median forecasts and the actual unrevised series from CITIBASE. The

actual revised, or official, series are also retrieved from the same source. In general, the data begin

in 1970 at the earliest, and in 1981 for several of the series. The data appendix contains detailed



rate. In their paper, Lahiri and Chun test for cointegration with unitary elasticity restrictions using
a less efficient ADF test on a constructed regressor.

3. METHODOLOGY

3.1 Unit Root Test

        For a time series {yt}t=1,...,T, the ADF test for a unit root is based on the regression


            )yt ' c % µt % Byt&1 % j (j)yt&j % ut
                                          k
                                                                                                     (1)
                                         j'1


The following procedure is used to determine the lag order parameter k. First, the Akaike

Information Criterion and the Schwartz Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC and SBC

respectively) are used to select the lag order among specifications k = 1, ..., 6. This is in accord

with Hall's (1994) finding that such a lag selection process can improve both the size and power

of the ADF test. Then, residuals from the selected specification are tested for serial correlation. If

significant serial correlation is detected, the lag length is increased until the model passes the

residual test. In many cases the two criteria yield similar inferences and so in order to conserve

space, we only report the results based on the AIC.

        The unit root null hypothesis is rejected if B estimate is significantly less than zero. Since

the usual t-statistic for B does not have a standard t-distribution, finite sample critical values that

adjusted for both sample size and lag order effects are used to determine the significance of the

ADF statistic (see Cheung and Lai (1995) for details).

3.2 Testing for Cointegration



   4
     Two of the unrevised series, GNP and industrial production index, have to be re-based to
express them in a constant numeraire (either in 1987$, or in a common base year). The series are
re-based by splicing them using data from the Survey of Current Business. This issue does not
arise in previous studies which examine percentage changes in these series.

                                                    5
        Testing for cointegration proceeds in the following manner. Consider in general an m × 1

vector xt of I(1) variables and its VAR(p) representation:

)xt ' µ % '1)xt&1 % '2)xt&2 % ... 'p&1)xt&p%1 % Axt&p % u t
                                                                                                   (2)
                       A ' "$)

where '1, '2, ... 'p-1, A are m × m matrices of unknown parameters. " and $ are m × r matrices,

representing the rate of reversion and cointegrating parameters, respectively. See Johansen (1991)

for a more detailed account of this cointegration methodology.

        Johansen proposes two tests for inferring the number of cointegrating vectors. The trace

statistic is used for testing the null hypothesis of at most r cointegrating vectors against the

alternative of m cointegrating vectors. The maximal eigenvalue statistic is used in testing the null

hypothesis of r-1 against r cointegrating vectors. According to our definition of "consistency",

forecasts should be cointegrated with the actual series. Failing this, forecasts could drift infinitely

far away from the actual series.

        A stronger requirement for the consistency of a forecast is that the coefficients in the

cointegrating vector are (-1 1). We find it plausible that the estimated cointegrating vector may

differ from that posited in previous studies. For instance, if the median survey response measures

the true market expectation with error, then the estimated cointegrating vector may very well be

different than (-1 1).

        A simple example can illustrate this point. Let y be the actual variable, ye be the

unobserved market expectation, and yf be the median survey response. If market expectations are

rational:




                                                   6
                   y ' ye % u         u - iid(0,F2)                                                      (3)



Further, suppose the median survey measures the market expectation with error of a particular

form:


                   y f ' N0 % N1 y e        N1 … 1                                                       (4)


Then re-writing one finds that the equation estimated with survey data is:

                             N0       1 f
                       y '        %      y % u
                             N1       N1                                                                 (5)
                                        f
                         ' b0 % b1y % u


That is, the elasticity of the actual with respect to the median survey response can deviate from

unity.

         Following Johansen (1991) and Johansen and Juselius (1990), the hypothesis of a linear

constraint on the cointegrating vector can be expressed as:

                             HG: $ ' GB                                                                  (6)



where G is a known m × r0 matrix of full rank r0, and B is a r0 × r matrix of unknown parameters

(m $ r0 $ r). If r0 = r, the cointegrating space is fully specified. If r0 = m, then no restriction is

imposed on ß. Note that G is the matrix that defines the coefficient restriction. In terms of (6), the

unitary elasticity restriction is described by (1 -1)', so r0 = 1 in this case. In the following section,

the Johansen (1991) likelihood ratio test statistic will be used to evaluate HG.




                                                      7
4 Estimation Results

   The unit root test results are presented in Table 1. The ADF Jt statistic is reported, as well as

the order of lags used in the regression. In five of nine cases, the reported series (what is termed

the "actual revised") fail to reject the unit root null using the 5% marginal significance level

(MSL). The exceptions are the three month Treasury Bill interest rate, housing starts, industrial

production and the CPI inflation rate. Reassuringly, the results for the initially reported

counterparts of these variables are in agreement, with the exception of housing starts and

industrial production. According to the originally reported data (hereafter "actual unrevised"),

housing starts and industrial production fail to reject the unit root null.

        For the real GNP series, the forecasts at all horizons match the order of integration for the

actual revised series. The same is true for the GNP deflator, after-tax corporate profits, and the

unemployment rate. These forecasts therefore fulfill the first condition of consistency.

        For housing starts and industrial production, slightly less than half of the forecasts are of

the same order of integration as the actual revised. Note that in both of these series' cases,

comparing against the actual unrevised series would cause a discrepancy since those series appear

to be trend stationary. In fact, it is somewhat troubling from a practical standpoint that the actual

revised and actual unrevised series do not appear to be of the same order of integration.

        The two interest rates present a different pattern of results. For the T-Bill rate, all the

series appear to be trend stationary with the exception of 1- and 3-quarter ahead forecasts. The

actual corporate bond rate appears to contain a unit root. However the 4-quarter ahead forecasts

appear trend stationary.

        To summarize the results, for the revised T-bill rate, GNP, GNP deflator, housing starts,


                                                   8
industrial production, corporate profits, unemployment and CPI inflation series and their

respective forecasts, the implied orders of integration are consistent. The same holds true for the

unrevised series, except housing starts and industrial production drop from the list. Of these, in

both sets, the GNP, GNP deflator, corporate profits and unemployment rate appear to be

integrated of order 1.

       Table 2 contains the Johansen test results. Evidence of cointegration is obtained for the

corporate bond rate at all relevant horizons, for the GNP deflator at the 1-quarter horizon, for

GNP at the 4-quarter horizon and the unemployment rate at all horizons except the 4-quarter. A

mixed finding is obtained for GNP at the 3-quarter horizon; the maximal eigenvalue statistic

indicates 0 cointegrating vectors, while the trace statistic indicates 1 vector. Since the trace

statistic appears to be more robust to non-Normal errors, in such cases we will interpret this as a

finding of cointegration. Consequently, we find 9 cases of cointegration out of a possible 19

cases. While similar results for unemployment were obtained by Aggarwal et al. (1995), we are

unaware of any similar findings for the other series.

       Our definition of consistency requires not only that the series do not drift infinitely far

apart, but also that the cointegrating vector is (-1 1). We find that this requirement holds for all

those cases where a single cointegrating vector is found, with the sole exception of the 1-quarter

horizon GNP deflator.

5 Single-Equation Error Correction Specifications

       The Engle-Granger (1987) representation theorem indicates that any cointegrated system

can be rewritten as an error correction system. Assuming the moving average process can be

approximated by a finite autoregression of the first differences, one obtains in the context of our

We are primarily interested in whether the forecast series responds to the actual revised series.

The results of estimating equations 20 and 21 are summarized in Panels A and B, respectively, of

Table 3. The series for which this question is relevant are the corporate bond rate (1- to 3-

quarter), GNP (3-, 4-quarter), and the unemployment rate (1- to 3-quarter). The corporate bond

rate, GNP and the unemployment rate forecasts respond to disequilibria, as measured by the

cointegrating error, in a statistically significant manner. While the actual series also respond to

these disequilibria, the proportion of variation explained is much lower than for the corresponding

forecast regressions.

        We also estimated error correction models with the cointegrating vector of (-1 1)

imposed. The results exhibit the same pattern as those using the estimated coefficients (which is

unsurprising given that the unitary elasticity condition is seldom rejected). These results are

available from the authors upon request.

6 Results Using Unrevised Data

        There has been some discussion of whether forecasters forecast the underlying variable of

interest, or the preliminary estimate. This ambivalence suggests that we evaluate the sensitivity of

our findings to whether the final (revised), or the initial (unrevised) series are used. Certainly,


                                                    10
some sensitivity is to be expected, most importantly because the order of integration implied by

the univariate tests differs between the revised and unrevised series in two instances: housing

starts, industrial production (see Table 1). In fact, the latter pair fails to exhibit evidence of

cointegration, while the former does.

          The results of running the cointegration tests are presented in Table 4. Overall, the

cointegration results do not appear to be substantially different than before. However, to the

extent that they differ, some pairs exhibit more evidence of a single cointegrating vector

(corporate profits and GNP deflator), and others less (unemployment). Furthermore, housing

starts are cointegrated while industrial production is not. Forecasters appear to be forecasting the

unrevised series (which are published soon after these forecasts) slightly more than they are the

revised series. This pattern of results is consonant with those obtained by Keane and Runkle

(1990).

          There are two ambiguous cases which merit additional discussion. The tests indicate that

the GNP 1-quarter ahead forecast and the actual series appear to each be stationary. Closer

inspection of the test statistics indicate that they are both borderline significant for 2 cointegrating

vectors. A similar situation applies to the trace statistic for the 3-quarter ahead GNP deflator and

the actual series. We interpret these cases as cases of cointegration with one cointegrating vector.

          The restriction on the cointegrating vector is rejected at the 5% MSL in only five cases

where cointegration is found (housing starts at 2-quarter horizon, GNP at 4-quarter horizon, and

the corporate bond rate at all relevant horizons) out of 15. To sum up, out of 22 pairs of forecasts

and actual series, 15 exhibit cointegration; of these, 10 pass the coefficient restriction test.

          Estimation of the relevant ECMs is reported in Table 5. The results indicate that of the


                                                   11
cointegrated pairs that pass the unitary-elasticity restriction, all except the 1- and 2-quarter ahead

GNP deflator, 1- and 2-quarter ahead corporate profits and the 1-quarter ahead housing starts

exhibit statistically significant response of the forecasts to the error correction term.

        Thus far, we have examined the consistency aspects of the survey forecasts. A related

issue is the relative importance of short and long run factors in determining the response of

forecasts. This question can be posed explicitly in the following manner. Taking equation (20), we

adduce to the long run factors the difference in adjusted R2's between the constrained specification

(omitting the error correction term) and the unconstrained specifications. Table 6 reports the

results using unrevised data, and the same lag structure as reported in Table 5.

The examination of this question using unrevised data is most appropriate because the forecasts

will be responding to disequilibria defined using the actually observed data. The actual revised

data are not available to the forecasters until months, and perhaps even years, after the forecasts

are made.

        The results indicate that in exactly the case where the rate of reversion is the most

pronounced, namely the corporate bond rate, the imposition of the long run restriction via the

error correction term adds the most, raising the adjusted R2 by between 0.61 and 0.75. For the

other variables, the difference is much less marked. However, as one would expect, the additional

information imparted by the error correction term increases with the forecast horizon. The

improvement rises from 0.02 to 0.10 as the forecast horizon for GNP increases from 1 quarter to

4 quarters ahead. Similarly, the GNP deflator improvement rises monotonically from 0.00 to 0.05.

Presumably, the importance of the error correction term would increase with even longer forecast

horizon.


                                                  12
       While the improvement in explained variation is sometimes modest, comparison to results

using other survey forecasts may be place these results in perspective. For instance Chinn and

Frankel (1994) find that while exchange rate expectations do respond to error correction terms

(defined as forecast errors), the degree of statistical significance was variable, even at the 12

month horizon.5 This suggests that, by comparison to other survey measures, there is substantial

long run information contained in the ASA-NBER forecasts.

7 Concluding Remarks

       This paper has applied a different, and less stringent, criteria for rationality to the ASA-

NBER macroeconomic forecasts. The findings of these tests are summarized in Table 7. Each "€"

entry denotes fulfillment of a single criterion. In Panel A (the revised series), 30 out of 36 cases

fulfill the requirement that forecast and actual possess the same order of integration. Eleven of

these cases involve trend stationary pairs, and are not further investigated. Of the 19 remaining

pairs, eight are definitely cointegrated; another pair is probably cointegrated with the trace

statistic indicating rejection of the null hypothesis of zero cointegrating vectors. Of the nine

cointegrated pairs, eight fulfill the requirement of unitary elasticity. The cases of consistency

appear largely series-specific -- the corporate bond rate and the unemployment rate account for

most of the cases.

       Surprisingly, the linkage between forecasts and unrevised actual series is not

unambiguously stronger. Twenty-eight of 36 cases fulfill the first requirement. Six of these cases

are trend stationary pairs. Of the 22 integrated pairs, 11 are clearly cointegrated, while an

model. The parameter estimates are reported in Table 4.2 of that paper.

                                                  13
additional four pairs are probably cointegrated. Ten out of 22 series fulfill the third criterion (as

opposed to eight out of 19 for the revised series). Hence, while there appears to be greater

evidence of cointegration for the unrevised series, there is only slightly greater evidence of

consistency.

        To sum up the specific findings, the final versions of the industrial production series and

the inflation rate, and most of their respective forecasts appear to be trend stationary. The

Treasury bill rate and housing starts are mixed. The corporate bond rate, GNP, the GNP deflator,

after tax corporate profits, unemployment and most of their respective forecasts appear to be

difference stationary. Almost half of the unit root series appear to be cointegrated with their

respective forecasts. In only one relevant case is the unitary elasticity restriction rejected. The

forecasts appear to behave in a reasonable manner; they respond to disequilibria (defined by the

estimated cointegrating vector). Moreover, this finding is robust to the use of an imposed (-1 1)

cointegrating vector, rather than an estimated one.

        Similar results are obtained when using the originally reported data (actual unrevised), In

accord with priors there is more evidence of cointegration. However, there is only slightly

evidence to support unitary elasticity of expectations.

        We conclude, in line with much recent research, that survey data do fulfill some weak

conditions for rationality, although seldom are all three criteria met.

Notes: MAXEIGEN (trace) indicates the maximal eigenvalue (trace) statistic; the
numbers in the parentheses are the implied number of cointegrating vectors using the
5% MSL and finite sample critical values (Cheung and Lai, 1993). Lag is the lag
order selected by the AIC. The critical values for the test on the restriction is
3.84 at the 5% MSL. * denotes significance at the 5% MSL.

Notes: ECT is the error correction coefficient * indicates significance at the 5%
marginal significance level, using heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors.
p,q (r,s) is the number of lags in the ECM regressions involving the forecast
(actual revised) variables as the dependent variable (see text). All Ljung-Box Q-
statistics of order 4 and 8 are not significant at the conventional levels.
