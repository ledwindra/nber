In

the literature of political business cycles, a majority of studies,

explicitly, assumes the Presidential system, where the election timings are
fixed.

Applying a political business cycles model to countries with a

parliamentary system must allow for the possibility of early elections,

Among others, Ito (1990) proposed a theoretical framework and
empirical tests to distinguish the following two hypotheses:

(I) the

government manipulates an economy in anticipation of elections (elections
cause cycles); and (ii) the opportunistic government waits for a period of

good economic performances to call a general election (booms trigger
elections).

They found strong evidence that the Japanese government (or

Put differently, it is more likely that the

Japanese government will call a general election if the growth is higher
and inflation is lover in the current quarter, other things being equaL.2
This paper improves upon Ito and Park (1987), Ito (1990) and Cargill

Hutchison (1988) in four respects.

First, international aspects are
considered in this paper. The existingliteratttre deals exclusively with
and

domestic variables. Second, the popularity function

is revised so that the

fitted value traces the actual experience better. Third, a specification
of the probit function, estimating the election probability depending on
economic performances, is improved so that the probability of election is

Fourth, samples are extended to include the election of February 1990,
while previous studies included only up to the 1986 election.

Political business cycles have become popular both among economists

and political scientists. (See Alberto Alesina (1988), Douglas Hibbs
(1987). William Nordhaus (1989), E. Tufte (1978) and Thomas Willett (1989)

for good surveys.)

However, international factors have been relatively

ignored in existing work. (A notable exception is Willett (1988).)

Three examples would motivate an open politico-economic model. First,
suppose that the government is interested in high growth and low inflation.

One

old trick to increase production and employment without causing

inflation

is to depreciate the currency causing export booms (beggar-thy-

neighbor policy). However, there is a counter-argument against the beggarthy-neighbor policy as an effective toot for growth, that it, the exchange
rate depreciation tends to result in imported inflation before the J-curv'ed

export expansion helps domestic growth.3" In either case, the exchange
rate may be manipulated in anticipation of coming elections.

Second, in

small open economy under fixed exchange rates, but without capital flows,

like Japan in the 1.950s and 1960s, the foreign exchange resefle was an
important constraint.

if foreign reserves become low, the government is

essentially forced to brake the economy to curb imports.

Third,

international factors could be understood from a slightly different angle.

Suppose that the government of Japan may be pursuaded by the United States

to take a "locomotive" role when elections in the United States nears.

Since, an economic expansion of the major trading partner would bring
growth with little political and economic costs, this kind of persuasion,

if successful, may be more beneficial for a country being pulled by a
locomotive than the beggar.thy-neighbor policy described above. In the era
of policy coordination, such instances may not be as uncommon as one might
think.

In 1978, it was highly publicized that the United States asked

Japan and Germany to become the engines leading world growth.

The rest of this paper consists of four sections. The next section

describes how international factors should be modeled in a political
business cycle model. Several conjectures are proposed and formulated into

testable implications. Section Three gives an overview of the experience
of the postwar Japanese election cycles. Section Four is devoted to format

tests of implications presented iii section Two.

The last section

summarizes results.

This paper finds only a weak link between election (timings) and
international variables except one that upcoming elections in the United

States tend to cause higher growth in Japan.

Evidence suggests that

although blatant policies, such as a beggar-thy-neighbor policy, were not
adopted, a more subtle international cooperation, in the form of Japanese
expansion to pull up the United States economy, have been used.

I. International Aspects in Political Business Cycles.

The government in most political business cycles models is assumed to

obtain higher growth and lower inflation in order to raise reelection
probabilities. In the existing literature, policy instruments toward these

goals consist of monetary and fiscal policies.

However, various policy

measures with respect to export and import offer other possibilities.

First, consider a small open economy under a fixed exchange rate
regime with strict capital controls, such as Japan before 1971.

As the

country's economy booms, imports grow faster than exports, drawing down the

constraints force the government to improve monetary or fiscal restraints
or both.

In that sense the level and movement of foreign reserves is a

better leading indicator for upcoming policy instruments and the direction

of the economy.4
Thus, this logic implies the first conjecture:

In a small open

economy under a fixed exchange rate regime with strict capital controls,

elections coincide with higher growth and a daclining foreign exchange
reserve,

Elint-Ltxt

External shocks may overwhelm domestic management in the small open

economy which largely depends on foreign trade.

A small open economy

without primary resources is subject to international disturbances. Export
booms may occur without the government manipulating growth or the exchange

rate, and recessions of the trading partners adversely affect business
conditions. (In the 1960s, Japan was said to catch a cold when the United

States sneezes. In the late l980s, the causality in the relationship is
said to be reversed. Anyway, U.S. political business cycles may spill over
to Japan through a trade link.) Exports are greatly influenced by business
conditions of major trading partners. Imports are subject to prices of oil
and other primary commodities. In the short run, a business climate may be
more influenced by foreign factors than domestic policies.

Moreover, in an era of policy coordination, policies of major
industrial

countries may

be coordinated so that the governments help each

other in world economic management.

Suppose the United States asks Japan

to expand so that export from the United States will increase with little

fear of inflation in the United States.

This is essentially the

"locomotive" theory the United States tried to sell to Japan and Germany in

1978. If this friendly persuasion is used before every Presidential
election, Japanese economic performances are affected accordingly.

These considerations suggest the second conjectures: Japanese
economic performances, i.e., growth and inflation, are affected by the
Presidential eLections of the United States. Put differently, there is an

international spillover of political business cycles.

includes two alternative scenarios:

Elint-l.txt

This conjecture

the domestically notivated U.S.

political business cycle affects Japan; or the Japanese government being
persuaded by the United States to expand in order to help the U.S. economy.

If external shocks come frequently, the small-country government may
want to just wait for favorable external shocks to call an election. This
reinforces a case for the opportunistic government behavior (in the sense
of Ito and Park (1987)).

Hence, the positive correlation between export

and election timing is the third conjecture.

(This conjecture applies to

both fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.)

Under the flexible exchange rate regime, the exchange rate may become
an additional policy instrument. If the manipulative government manages to

depreciate its own currency, an export-Led boom could be obtained, If the

opportunistic governent tends to take an opportunity of a currency
depreciation and an export increase, then the same correlation would
result.

Hence, the fourth conjecture is that the currency tends to

depreciate before elections and appreciate after elections.

This

conjecture is more likeLy if the opportunistic government chooses election

timings depending on an autonomous currency fluctuation.

For if the

manipulative government intends to move the exchange rate by a substantial

margin before and after an election, then this would become subject to
arbitrage operations in the efficient market.

In summary, U.S. election timings as well as export, import, and

exchange rate behavior would be examined in relation to the Japanese
election timings and economic performances in order to gain some insights

on the four conjectures. In the next two sections, various attempts will
be made along these conjectures.

Conflicts over the nomination of Prime

Minister, the budget legislation and the treaty ratification should be

tution."5 Moreover, all Prime Ministers since the 1950 and the majority
of cabinet members are traditionally chosen from members of the House of
Representatives.

Liberal Deaocratic Party (LI)?),

The

Liberal

formed in 1955 by merging the

and Democratic Parties, has been dominant in the House of Represen-

tatives. Since its formation, the LOP

alone

has controlled the majority of

the House of Representatives with an exceptional

period from 1983 to 1986,

when the New Liberal Club (which was a spin-off of the LDP,

existed from

1976 to 1986) joined as a minor partner of the coalition government.
Although the LOP has controlled a majority, and that was most of the
time expected, the winning margin is a concern for the LDP. Since the allo-

cation of

committee chairpersons to parties are decided according to the

share of seats in the House of Representatives, a big winning margin means
more chairpersons, and

paper exclusively deals with thirteen general elections between

1955 to 1990. There are three possibilities to trigger general elections.

called. But in all but one (December 1976) occasion, early elections were

Second, if the House of Representatives passes a resolution of

non-confidence in the cabinet, then the Prime Minister has to dissolve the

House of Representatives unless the cabinet resigns for the renomination.
This occurred in 1980.

(The passage of a resolution was due to an absence

of some LDP members at the voting time.

Since the passing of the non-

confidence resolution was largely not planned, this election is dummied out

in some of empirical investigations below.) Third, the Prime Minister can

just call the election before the full term. This case applies to eleven
out of the thirteen elections. Clearly, the timing of elections has been
used as an important decision variable of the LDP.

When

half of the Upper House is reelected every three years, while a member has

a six-year term). In two occasions (June 1980 and July 1986), both House
elections took place on the same day.

Since many voters who favor LDP

are

said to be less motivated to come to the poll, a same-day (dojitsu)
election, or a "double election," in

which voters may cast two important

ballots with a fixed transactions coats, works in favor of LDP. In fact,
the LDP won with a sizable margin in the two double elections.

Thus, a

Dojitsu dummy variable will be applied in estimating a popularity function.

11.8. Economic Behaviors around Election Timings

First of all, let us review growth and inflation in postwar Japan.
Figure 1 shows time-series of annual OMP growth and CPI inflation rates
(changes over the preceding four quarters), with election quarters being
indicated by vertical lines, in Japan. It is obvious that many elections

coincided with at or near peak GNP growth cycles prior to 1974.

The

relationship is not apparent after the mid-l970s. As for the inflation
behavior, there is no clear-cut relationship with election timings.

Figure 1 about here

table 1

(panels

A - E) shows changes of various economic variables

before, at, and after elections (without the full-term election of 1980:2).

The change from T-5 to T-1, that from T-1 to T, and that from T to T+4,
respectively, defines PRE-election quarters, at the ELE-ction quarter, and

PoST-election

quarters of each election quarter (I). Table 1-A shows the

CNP growth rate and Inflation rate around elections. Up to the mid-l970s1
Real OMP shows a very strong

quarters. The CPI inflation rates of the ELE-ction quarters are lower than

and especially than PoST quarters. These findings are
consistent with both the opportunistic and manipulative government views,
PRE quarters

Table 1-B shows the changes in receipts from abroad (Export) and
payments to abroad (Import) in the CNP statistics.

Table 1-C shows the

changes in Export and Import in the balance of payments (IKE formula).
There is no obvious pattern in the movement of export and import before and

after election quarters. However, both export and import at the election
quarter tend to be less than before or after. As conjectured earlier, if

an export drive, whether it was manipulated or by accident, was used to
generate economic growth, it should show up in higher export growth in ELE
and PRE quarters than PST quarters. This is not the case.
The movement of foreign exchange reserves and the yen/dollar exchange

rate around elections are summarized in Table l-D.

Again, there is no

pattern of foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate movements around
election quarters.

We have no evidence for a conjecture that foreign

reserves are drawn down before an election but restored after the election
through a possible recession,

Table l-E shows the interest rate movement around the election time.

It does not show any systematic pattern before and after elections.

In

particular, the official discount rate, which has a signaling role as well

as its original role had been raised substantially before 1979 and 1990
elections.

However, the move of raising the official discount rate was

reported to be opposed by the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Japan raised
the rate in order to stop a potential inflation."6"

elint—2.txt

Table 1 (A-E) about here

From a different international causality perspective, a political

effect of U.S. elections on Japanese economic behavior (the second
conjecture) is examined in Table 2.

This table shows changes in the four

major Japanese economic variables around elections in the United States.
There is no evidence for a hypothesis that Japan was a locomotive for the
United States. However, Japanese exports tend to be less in one-year prior

to the United States presidential elections. This occurs even though the

United States may be stimulated for the election.

Hence, it is not a

declining demand problem. It is more likely that Japan hold back exports
in order not to offend the Arserican voters and politicians by a high volume

of exports in "sensitive" times.

Table 2 about here

In sum, by casual observations on economic performances in the pre-,

at and post-election periods, there is some evidence that the Japanese
election timings are correlated with high growth and low inflation. There
is little evidence that high growth and low inflation are achieved through

exchange rate management, export drive, or interest rate manipulation. In

particular, there is no evidence that the beggar-thy-neighbor policy was
employed to gain better economic performances for elections, or conversely,

no evidence that the exchange rate appreciation was engineered to hold down
inflation.

However, Japanese exports are found to be lower before the

election and higher after the election.

III. Empirical Investigation
111.1.. Popularity function

Plrst, the popularity function is examined. The seat share won by the
LDP

in

the House of Representatives elections is regressed on the CNP

growth rate, GNPD; CPI Inflation rate, INFL; in addition to a constant,
trend

(linear and quadratic) and a DOJITSU (same-day election) dummy

variable:
SE&Tt — a

+ b1*t + b2*T*t + c*CtPDt + d*INFLt + e*DOJItSU

Judging economic performance by growth and inflation, it has to be judged

how long (prior to the election) lags the model should allow,
Theoretically, it depends on the length of voters' relevant information set

in their decision of rewarding the incumbent, or of judging the quality of

the incumbent. Different specifications with respect to the length of the

past information of growth and inflation are examined. Specification and
results are shown in Table 3-A.

Table 3 about here

With a one-quarter information set, coefficients of the growth and
inflation rates have expected signs and most of them are statistically
significant, With a one-year information set, the result is similar, as
shown.

Using information with two years (not shown), the growth

coefficients become insignificant in the Linear trend version.

However, the magnitude of these coefficients is rather snail.
Although different specifications yield different results, the following
rough estimates give a ballpark figure. Suppose that the growth rate is 2

elint-3.txt

— 12 —

percentage points (in annualized rate) higher, then the LDP share becomes
about one percentage point (5 persons) higher. Similarly1 if the inflation

rate is higher by 2 percentage points, then the LDP

share becomes one

percentage point lower.

A specification with a quadratic trend ten is also tried because the

specification with a linear trend tends to underestimate LDP's share in
recent elections.

(The decline in the LDP share seems to have stopped

in the l9BOs.) The quadratic term seems to be significant. However, the
inflation coefficient tends to become insignificant with a quadratic trend

term. This implies the following: It is a judgemental decision whether a
rise (or at least a stop of a decline) in the support for the ID!' in the
1980s is due to inflation or a change in the trend.

Because of the relatively small degree of freedom, one might suspect
that the result may not be robust. One specification to save the degree of

freedom is to regress the popularity on the trend and dummy variables
first, and then to regress the residual on the economic variables.

The

results1 Table 3-B, show that economic variables are also significant in
that regression.

In sum, the estimated popularity function implies that the Japanese

voters respond positively to higher growth and lower inflation in the

election quarter (or up to one year information) and reward the ID?
(incumbent) accordingly in the election.

111.3. Polity Reactions: Elections on Economic Performance

In this section, we examine whether the foreign reserves have any
significant effect on growth and whether prospects of elections have any

predictable effects on growth.

First, the cross correlation between the

(ratio of) foreign reserve to its economic size and GNF is examined (Table

4-A). Growth is regressed on lagged growth, current and lagged reserves,
and the election variables, TSLE,

that

it the number of quarters elapsed

since the last election. The lags, 1, 2, and 8 of the reserves ratio are

taken because the 8th lag in autocorrelation reveals the highest
correlation:

GNPDr — a + bo*RESt + bi*&ESt i. + b2*flS2 + b8*RESt8

+

c1*GNPDt 1 + 02*GNPD 2 + dj*TSLEt +

where RES is the ratio of official foreign reserves (in dollars) to CNP
(nominal CNP converted to dollars by the average yen/dollar race over the

preceding three years).

The possibility of prospective elections are

considered by the TSLE variable and its squared term. Including directly
an election dummy variable would possibly cause a problem since it may be

the case that high growth triggers the election but nor the other way
around.

As Table 4-3 shows, an increase in the foreign researves ratio tends
to decrease economic growth. The conclusion does not depend on whether an
entire period is considered or only the the fixed exchange rate regime is
considered.

This is contrary to our conjecture, in that the foreign

reserves acted as a brake on Japanese economic growth.

There is a reason

for this counter-intuitive result. That is, the regression suffers from a

simultaneous equation bias, the foreign reserve is also dependent on
growth.

Higher growth, which stimulates imports, would lower foreign

reserves under the fixed exchange rate regime. Hence, the regression seems

the U.S. elections. Moreover, the lower Japanese inflation cannot

be explained by the U.S. locomotive.

Second, the Japanese will increase growth just before the U.S.
election, presumably to be a "locomotive" for the U.S. econony. to be a

locomotive, growth has to be attained by the Japanese domestic demand
stimulation rather than by exports.

This observation combined with the

fact that inflation goes down at the same time suggests that the yen had
been appreciated to help keep inflation down. This is just the opposite of

the "beggar-thy-neighbor" policy, which may be a first thought on the
international aspect of elections, a result of a special kind of policy
coordination.

Ill-C. Economic Performances on Election Timing

The last set of regressions measure impacts of various economic
variables, including external variables, on the probability of elections

are examined by estimating a probit function. When the government under
the Parliamentary system sees high growth and low inflation, it may decide

to call a general election. In addition to variables that are relevant to

current economic conditions, variables that help predict economic
conditions in coming quarters should be included in the probit function,

since decisions to call an election depend on its judgement on how the
economy will evolve from the current to the next quarter.

ELEC — a + b*GNPDt + c*EXPCRt + d*INYLt + e*TSLEl6 +

elint-3.txt

f*S +

where ELEC is a probability of election; EXPGR is a growth rate of real
exports in CUP statistics: TSL.E16 is l/(l6.OOL-TSLE). TSLE16 is included

so that the probability of election goes to (very close to) one
automatically when the number of quarters since the last election becomes

16 (that is, the full term).7'

if

TSLE itself is used, as in Ito and Park

(1987) and Ito (1990), the predicted probability of election does not
necessarily becomes one when TSLE goes to 16.

In this sense, the use of

TSLE16 imposes the constitutional constraint on the probit function.

Results are shown in Table 6.

We find that influences of CNP growth

and CPI inflation on the probability of elections are statistically
significant.

However1 the magnitude is not necessarily very strong.

Having export growth in place of. or in addition to, CUP growth does not
improve estimates. The ratio of foreign reserves to the economic size does
not improve the estimates.

Table 6 about here

IV. Concluding Remarks

In this paper, the Japanese experience of general elections were
examined in cotmection with external impacts.

The analytical tools are

basically the sane as ito (l99a). However, many improvements, major and minor,
in specifications have been made: First, the quadratic trend in the voting

function was introduced to increase accuracy in predicting the LOP's
winning share.

Second, the TSLE16 variable was introduced in the probit

function of election timing to impose the constitutional constraint on the

probit function. Third, major improvements on the specification were made

elirt—3 .txt

to include inter-national variables.

Voters are found to respond positively to high growth and low
inflation.

Reflecting this response, general elections tend to be called

at a quarter when growth and

inflation

is higher, given that the full term

(16 quarters since last elections) nears. However, we find no systematic
influence of international variables, such as foreign reserves and exchange

rate movements,

on the timing of elections, or the Japanese economic

performance. However, we found a surprising result in that there are

significant impacts of US eLection timings on the Japanese economic
performances. In the era of international coordination, there will be more

international spillovers of elections. We have established a first piece
of evidence on the importance of this link. This will hopefully lead to a
fruitful direction of future research in political business cycles.

Notes
*

I

am very much indebted to Thomas Willett for his suggestions and

comments on the earlier version of this paper.

Comments from other

participants in the Conference on "Political Influences in International

Economic Models" have been very helpful.

I gratefully acknowledge

financial support from Nihon Relzai Kenkyu Shorei Zaidan (Japan Economic
Research Fund).

1. Takashi Inoguchi (1979, 1983) was the first to state an hypothesis that

the Japanese government chooses election timing depending on economic
performance.

He called it the 'surfing" hypothesis, implying the
Ito and Park (1988) and Ito

government riding on natural business waves.

(1990) devised an econometric test to differentiate the opportunistic and

manipulative government behaviors in the probit function of election
timings.

They found that the Japanese government tended to wait for good

economic perfonsances to call elections.

They have also tested whether

monetary and fiscal policies were manipulated in the anticipation of
elections,

but have not found any evidence.

Terrones (1989) shows in a

theoretical

model that parliamentary governments engage in less

manipulations

in the economy, much in agreement with various studies by

Inoguchi, Ito and Park.

Thomas Cargill and Michael Hutchison (1988, 1989) investigated a
similar problem, and obtained an opposite conclusion: no support for the
opportunistic hypothesis, but for the manipulative behavior.

They argue

that after 1975, the Bank of Japan caused a systematic downward shift in

the interbank rate preceding Lower House elections.

Kobno and Nishizawa (1990) studied the behavior of public constnction
starts series from 1955 to 1984, showing that the monthly share of public
construction starts within the fiscal year shows that it has spikes in the

election months. This is taken to be a result of particular manipulation
for the elections.

2. However, Cargil!. and Hutchison (1988) and Kohno and Nishizawa (1990)

obtained results conflicting with Ito and Park (1987) and Ito (1990).
Cargill and Hutchison estimated the simultaneous equation system with
election timing (0-I variable) and C1P growth as endogenous variable. With
two-stage estimation, they showed that election timing affects CNP growth,

but the election probability is not affected by CNP growth.

This is an

opposite conclusion of Ito and Park (1987) and Ito (1990). Several reasons

for the conflict have not been suspected.

First, specifications are

different, the inflation variable is not used in Cargill. and Hutchison.

Second, Ito and Park (1987) and Ito (1990) did not use the two-stage
estimation in the CNP growth equation. Hence, in place of the fitted value
of (probability of) election in the CNP equation which was used in Cargill

and Hutchison, Ito used Time elapsed since last election, or the cx post

probability of election.

Third1 the instrumental variables must be

different. Fourth, dummy variables are different.
As for the results of Kobno and Nishizawa (1990) on the fiscal policy

front, they have used a particular variable related to government expen-

diture. As their em?irical results stand, acne puzzles may arise, Why do
Japanese voters believe (or so believes the incumbent) that a particular

spike in the "share of the monthly construction starts in the fiscal year
is a good signal, because any one could see that an increase in the share
this month has to be compensated by a decrease in another month, since the
budget for this is fixed in the beginning of the fiscal year.

3.

For this observation, 1 acknowledge Willett (1988) and his counnents at

the conference.

4.

This statement fits well with conventional, wisdom regarding the

Japanese economy in the 1950s and l960s.

See lutaka Kosai (1986) and Hugh

Patrick and Henry Rosovsky (1976; chapter 3).

5. As a result of the 1989 election, the LDP

lost

the majority in the House

of Councilors. The House of Representatives nominated Toshiki Kaifu, LDP,

for Prime Minister, while the House of Councilors nominated Takako Doi,
Socialist, for Prime Minister,

After the conference committee convened,

the House of Representatives decision prevailed according to the
Constitution.

6.

On December 19, 1989, major newspapers reported that raising the

discount rate is certain. Then the Minister of Finance angrily gave an
interview that he would not allow the Bank of Japan to raise the discount

rate. The Governor had to deny the possibility in public.

However, the

discount rate was raised within ten days after this fiasco.

7.

I thank Satoru Kanoh and Robert Engle for their suggesting this

improvement -
