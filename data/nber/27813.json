    "abstract": "\n\nLarge in-person gatherings without social distancing and with individuals who have traveled outside the local area are classified as the \u201chighest risk\u201d for COVID-19 spread by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Between August 7 and August 16, 2020, nearly 500,000 motorcycle enthusiasts converged on Sturgis, South Dakota for its annual motorcycle rally.  Large crowds, coupled with minimal mask-wearing and social distancing by attendees, raised concerns that this event could serve as a COVID-19 \u201csuper-spreader.\u201d  This study is the first to explore the impact of this event on social distancing and the spread of COVID-19.  First, using anonymized cell phone data from SafeGraph, Inc. we document that (i) smartphone pings from non-residents, and (ii) foot traffic at restaurants and bars, retail establishments, entertainment venues, hotels and campgrounds each rose substantially in the census block groups hosting Sturgis rally events.  Stay-at-home behavior among local residents, as measured by median hours spent at home, fell.  Second, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a synthetic control approach, we show that by September 2, a month following the onset of the Rally, COVID-19 cases increased by approximately 6 to 7 cases per 1,000 population in its home county of Meade.  Finally, difference-in-differences (dose response) estimates show that following the Sturgis event, counties that contributed the highest inflows of rally attendees experienced a 7.0 to 12.5 percent increase in COVID-19 cases relative to counties that did not contribute inflows.  Descriptive evidence suggests these effects may be muted in states with stricter mitigation policies (i.e., restrictions on bar/restaurant openings, mask-wearing mandates).  We conclude that the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally generated public health costs of as much as $12.2 billion.\n\n",
