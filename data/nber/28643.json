    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper measures excess labor supply in equilibrium. We examine hiring shocks\u2014which employ 24% of the labor force in external month-long jobs\u2014in Indian local labor markets. In peak months, wages increase instantaneously and local aggregate employment declines. In lean months, consistent with severe labor rationing, wages and aggregate employment are unchanged, with positive employment spillovers on remaining workers\u2014indicating that over a quarter of labor supply is rationed. At least 24% of lean self-employment among casual workers occurs because they cannot find jobs. Consequently, traditional survey approaches mismeasure labor market slack. Rationing has broad implications for labor market analysis.\n\n",
