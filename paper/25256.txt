ABSTRACT
This paper makes two contributions. First, we examine the macroeconomic implications of Puerto
Rico’s Fiscal Plan that was certified in March 2017 for fiscal years 2017-18 to 2026-27. Second,
we perform a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) that incorporates the expected macroeconomic
dynamics implied by the Fiscal Plan in order to compute Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs.
We detect a number of flawed assumptions in the Fiscal Plan that lead to an underestimation of
its contractionary effects on the island’s economic activity. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of
the expected macroeconomic dynamics implied by the plan that allows us to construct more
realistic scenarios of Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. We show that the island’s current
debt position is unsustainable, and compute the necessary debt relief to restore sustainability
under different sets of assumptions. The paper offers general insights for performing a macroconsistent DSA.

1. INTRODUCTION
Puerto Rico’s economy has been suffering a recession for more than a decade. The
recession has led to a debt and economic crisis. On May 3, 2017, a bipartisan financial oversight
and management board imposed by the US Congress in order to make the fiscal policy decisions
for the island, and acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, filed a petition for the adjustment of
Puerto Rico’s debts in the Federal Court for the District of Puerto Rico under Title III of
PROMESA, a federal law enacted by the US Congress to deal with Puerto Rico’s debt crisis that
provides a legal frameworks with elements that are similar to a bankruptcy law. The decision
triggered the beginning of a debt restructuring process.
Puerto Rico’s current situation is of the kind that calls for an analysis of debt sustainability.
Assessing the sustainability of the debt position of a macroeconomic unit is a complex exercise
for a number of reasons, that have been extensively discussed in the literature. Puerto Rico offers
a relevant case in which to examine these issues, and we do so by performing a macro-consistent
debt sustainability analysis (DSA) that builds on the insights from the theoretical literature, in
order to provide guidance for the general practice of DSA.
Our contribution is thus twofold. First, we examine the macroeconomic implications of
Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Plan that has been approved for fiscal years 2017-18 to 2026-27, as it is a
crucial element for a computation of Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. Second, we perform
a macro-consistent Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) that incorporates the expected
macroeconomic dynamics implied by the Fiscal Plan in order to compute the island’s restructuring
needs.
We stress two important caveats. First, we note that the computations included in this paper
were performed before the hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Puerto Rico. We claim that the
methodological and empirical analysis offered in this paper will serve as the basis to update the
computations when more precise information on the costs of the hurricanes becomes available.
Second, this paper does not study the causes that led to the debt crisis. The reader interested
in an analysis of the factors that contributed to the unsustainable growth of Puerto Rico’s debt is
referred to Caraballo-Cueto and Lara (2017), and the references therein. Caraballo-Cueto and Lara
(2017) offer a thorough analysis that connects the evolution of Puerto Rico’s debt to
deindustrialization. The study points to the fragility of an economic model focused on tax2

incentivized industrialization as a major determinant of the unsustainable debt dynamics
experienced by the island. The authors provide evidence that supports the hypothesis that a
deindustrialization process, triggered by a change in US tax and trade policies and the subsequent
failure of the island’s government and private sector to adapt, led to a secular decline of the
economic activity that was followed by a reduction in government revenues and increasing levels
of debt. 2
Besides this introduction, this paper includes five other sections. Section 2 introduces the
conceptual framework that serves as the basis of our analysis of the Fiscal Plan and the
computation of the debt restructuring needs. The conceptual analysis notes that a central aspect of
any debt restructuring plan is the bi-directional causality between the debt policies and economic
growth; the depth of the necessary restructuring depends on the economic growth prospects of the
debtor, but at the same time the economic growth depends on the debt burden.

Absent

macroeconomic policies that expand the aggregate demand, Puerto Rico will not recover; and if
the economy does not recover, Puerto Rico will not be able to pay its creditors without imposing
severe damages on its nearly 3.5 million residents. On the the other hand, a larger debt reduction
would imply that the territory would have more resources for expansionary macroeconomic
policies, making the recovery more feasible and full repayment of the restructured debt more
likely.
Section 3 examines the Fiscal Plan certified in March 2017 for the period 2017-2026. It
first discusses its assumptions. We claim that some of its critical assumptions are unsound and
analyze their implications. We identify a number of core flaws in its design and perform a
sensitivity analysis, with respect to the assumptions, for the fiscal multipliers and the effects of the
structural reforms. This analysis suggests that the fall in real GNP over the next decade was likely
to be significantly larger than what the plan had predicted.
Section 4 presents a computation of Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. We first
demonstrate that the island’s current debt position is unsustainable. Assuming the fiscal plan will
be respected, absent a debt restructuring, the territory would be forced to sustain primary fiscal
surpluses between 3.5% and 7.4% of GNP from 2027 onwards, forever. But pursuing such a fiscal
surplus would lead to a contraction that would make the collection of the necessary tax revenues

to achieve it simply untenable, making the fiscal surplus unfeasible. We compute the necessary
debt reduction to restore debt sustainability for different combinations of assumptions. We report
the following main conclusions:
(i)

When we maintain the assumptions of the Fiscal Plan, we obtain that the necessary
reduction of Puerto Rico’s debt to restore debt sustainability will have to include a
full cancellation of the interest payments that are scheduled not to be repaid in the
Fiscal Plan, plus a face value reduction that will have to lie roughly between 45 and
65 percent of the current debt stock of $51.9 billions included in the Fiscal Plan.

(ii)

However, the relevant universe of the public sector’s debt obligations may go
beyond the debts included in the Fiscal Plan, as the sustainability of the public
sector’s debt may also depend on the sustainability of a large part of debt issued by
other public entities that is not included in the Fiscal Plan. When we compute the
necessary relief assuming that the relevant stock of debt corresponds to the total
debt of the public sector 3, which increases the relevant stock to $72.2 billions, we
obtain that the necessary reduction includes full cancellation of unpaid interest plus
a face value reduction of between 60 and 73 percent of this alternative relevant
stock of public debt.

(iii)

Under a more comprehensive range of assumptions for fiscal multipliers that
includes both the assumption of the Fiscal Plan and other more realistic scenarios,
and dismissing the unjustifiably optimistic positive assumed effects of the structural
reforms on GNP growth for the period 2017-2026, we conclude that if the fiscal
plan is implemented, the territory would need full cancellation of interest payments
not scheduled for payment in the Fiscal Plan plus a face value reduction that lies
between roughly 50 and 80 percent to restore debt sustainability – and again, the
necessary reduction is larger if we take $72.2 billions instead of the just $51.9
billions included in the Fiscal Plan as the relevant universe of debt obligations.

Our computations are conservative, as we are not addressing how migration flows will be
affected by the deeper depression that the fiscal plan is projected to generate, and more
importantly, we are maintaining the fiscal plan’s controversial assumption that the territory will

of residents of Puerto Rico.

somehow manage to achieve a steady state annual nominal GNP growth rate of 2.6% without
having implemented any expansionary aggregate demand policies. Thus, the range of the values
of necessary debt relief that we obtain must be considered as a lower-bound.
The structure of seniority will imply that not all bondholders will get the same discount.
Our analysis does not study how the debt write-off will be distributed among bondholders, but
simply provides a perspective on the macroeconomic needs. The distribution of losses will be
determined by legal considerations that go beyond the object of this study.
We argue that in order to deal with the uncertainty that will underlie the implementation of
the fiscal plan and the debt restructuring, the restructuring process could include GNP linked bonds
that align debt payments with Puerto Rico’s capacity to pay. By definition, these bonds improve
the sustainability of the restructured debt and align the incentives of the debtor and the creditors
such that the creditors would also benefit from a stronger recovery.
Finally, section 5 concludes with a summary of the policy implications of the analyses and
findings of the paper for resolving Puerto Rico’s social, economic, and debt crisis.

2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
2.A PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY AND MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS
A public debt sustainability analysis must be able to answer the two following questions:
Q1. Is public debt sustainable with high probability?
Q2. If it isn’t, what are the restructuring needs in order to restore debt sustainability?
Answering Q1 and Q2 requires a definition of the concept of debt sustainability. The
economic definition of public debt sustainability refers to the capacity of the government to satisfy
its intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) without resorting to a debt default. The IBC states that
the present discounted value of primary fiscal surpluses has to be equal to the value of outstanding
debt. Each trajectory of states is associated with an IBC. Formally, in an infinite time setup we can
describe the IBC in one trajectory of states as:

5

−𝑗𝑗
𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡∗ = ∑∞
𝑗𝑗=0(1 + 𝑟𝑟) 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡+𝑗𝑗

(IBC)

which holds if and only if
1

lim (1+𝑟𝑟)𝑗𝑗 𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡+𝑗𝑗 = 0

𝑗𝑗→∞

(TC)

where the condition (TC) is known as the government’s transversality condition, 𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡∗ =

(1 + 𝑟𝑟)𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡−1,𝑡𝑡 denotes debt to output ratio at the start of period 𝑡𝑡, 𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡 is the primary fiscal surplus to
1+𝑅𝑅

output ratio in period t, and 1 + 𝑟𝑟 = 1+𝑔𝑔, where 𝑅𝑅 is the nominal interest rate and 𝑔𝑔 is the growth

rate of output (for simplicity we denote them as constant). In the context of Puerto Rico, we will
use GNP as the measure of output.

More generally, the definition of debt sustainability may also refer to other economic or
non-economic principles that are meant to ensure an efficient functioning of debt markets and the
respect human rights. For instance, debt could be considered unsustainable if full payment would
entail the need to cut on essential public services. 4 Therefore, the satisfaction of the government’s
solvency condition is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for debt sustainability, as the
territory’s development needs have to be taken into account. Relatedly, defining debt sustainability
also requires a definition of the relevant universe of creditors. Defining the universe of creditors
in a public debt restructuring is different than in a corporate debt restructuring, as the creditors of
a country need not be only the formal creditors but also the informal ones – as pensioners and
workers.

PUBLIC DEBT AND MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS
The objects of each side of the IBC are not independent. The capacity to collect revenues
depends on the level of economic activity. In turn, the level of economic activity depends on fiscal
policies. But the space of feasible fiscal policies depends on the debt burden. Formally, the primary
fiscal surpluses that enter the IBC must be consistent objects that respect the functional relationship
between fiscal policies, economic activity, and fiscal revenues. The consideration of these
endogenous feedback effects in a system in which fiscal outcomes, the level of economic activity,

The literature on the principles that should be respected in a restructuring process significantly grown over the last few years. For instance, see
Blankenburg and Kozul-Wright (2016), Bohoslavsky and Goldmann (2016), Goldmann (2016), Guzman and Stiglitz (2016a, 2016b), Kolb (2006),
Raffer (2016), and Li (2015).

and the borrowing costs are endogenous variables is central in any analysis of debt sustainability,
and missing it leads to flawed estimates of the implications of debt policies.
Puerto Rico’s deep and long-lasting downturn has put the economy into a demandconstrained regime. Such a situation calls for the application of macroeconomic policies that
expand the aggregate demand – a basic principle of macroeconomic theory. Implementing
expansionary macroeconomic policies requires the capacity for financing them. But a country that
is in a demand-constrained regime and faces a debt burden that is unsustainable lacks the capacity
for expansionary policies. Instead, the unsustainable debt position becomes a drag for economic
growth. The logic is simple: when the debt position is perceived as unsustainable with a high
probability, the cost of refinancing debt increases; this in turn increases the burden of interest
payments, and decreases the available resources net of interest payments for financing public
policies. Attempting to force full repayment under those conditions creates a destabilizing
dynamic. The induced fiscal austerity decreases aggregate demand, which in the demandconstrained regime leads to a deeper recession, which in turn leads to a debt position perceived as
even more unsustainable, and so on. Indeed, the idea that fiscal austerity could somehow restore
debt sustainability in an already depressed economy, in times in which the private sector is also
contracting, without contemplating the possibility of destabilizing contractionary spirals, is ill
conceived and not aligned with sound macroeconomic theory or evidence. 5 The uncertainty
created by an unresolved debt problem also deters new investment in the economy, so that in
addition to the negative impact on aggregate demand there is an adverse effect on aggregate supply
.6

7

Thus, in these circumstances—those prevailing today in Puerto Rico—the recovery of debt
sustainability is a necessary condition for economic recovery:

There is no possibility of

implementing the policies needed for macroeconomic recovery when debt is unsustainable. To
restore debt sustainability, debt must be restructured—a restructuring that goes beyond just
“reprofiling,” e.g. changing the maturity of the obligations. Even creditors as a group may benefit

(2012); Herndon, Ash, and Polish (2014), Jorda and Taylor (2013); see also the commentaries by Krugman (2010, 2013, 2015) and Stiglitz (2010a).

See Krugman (1988a). The destabilizing dynamics at play in the context of a financial crisis has been thoroughly analyzed in the macroeconomics
literature by seminal authors as Fisher (1933), Keynes (1936), Minsky (1977, 1992), Kindleberger (1978), Leijonhufvud (1981), Stiglitz and
Heymann (2014), Koo (2003), and Eggertsson and Krugman (2014), among many others.

In Puerto Rico, the sub-utilization of factors can rapidly turn into migration, a phenomenon that would not be captured by measures of intensity

from a restructuring, because the expansionary effects that it allows increases the size of the pie
that is distributed among the claimants. 8
We have just described the ex-ante effects of unsustainable debt—costs that are borne well
before a default actually occurs. In addition, there may be large costs which occur when the default
actually occurs, and the anticipation of these costs themselves can have adverse effects in the
present. The theoretical literature suggests various channels through which debt defaults are
associated with output losses as the result of, for example, reputational damage and international
trade exclusion costs (e.g., Eaton and Gersovitz 1981; Bulow and Rogoff 1989; Cole and Kehoe
1998; Aguiar and Gopinath 2006; Arellano 2008). 9 However, the empirical literature suggests that
the major costs have been those associated with the impact of defaults on domestic bondholders
(Sandleris, 2016). 10 11

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FISCAL POLICIES, REVENUES, AND GNP GROWTH: THE FISCAL MULTIPLIERS
The effects of the fiscal policies that are included in a macroeconomic plan depend on the
size of fiscal multipliers, i.e. the parameters that describe the impact of fiscal policies on the level
of economic activity. Thus, any fiscal plan must aim at making realistic assessments on the values
of the fiscal multipliers.
There are different types of multipliers. The ‘spending to output multiplier’ refers to the
effect of changes in public spending on output. The ‘tax rate to output multipliers’ refer to the
effects of changes of different tax rates on output; from the tax multipliers, we can infer the values
of the ‘revenues to output multipliers’, which indicate how a variation in fiscal revenues will affect
output. Finally, the ‘spending to revenues multipliers’ indicates how a change in public spending
will affect tax revenues through the effects that it will have on the endogenous tax bases.
8
This claim has been demonstrated by Krugman (1988b), who demonstrates that the expected present discounted value of payments for creditors
takes the shape of a Laffer curve as a function of the value of the debtor’s total liabilities. The reason is that the probability of default, and thus the
interest rate, is an increasing function of the debt burden. Sachs (1989) also emphasizes the potential welfare benefits of forgiving debt in a situation
of debt overhang, in a model where both creditors and debtors can gain from a partial debt write-down, since an excessive debt stock and the
prospect of large future debt repayments act as a tax on domestic investment and depress the present value of claims held by investors. Under those
conditions, debt relief should be followed by a period of higher growth.
9
The theoretical literature suggests, however, that the costs arising from the exclusion from financial markets may be less than is often feared,
because capital markets are forward looking. Indeed, by reducing existing debt obligations, a default may make lending to the country more
attractive. See Stiglitz (2010b).
10
Debt restructuring renegotiations under insufficient legal frameworks for dealing with collective action problems also result in inefficient delays
that reduce output (Benjamin and Wright 2009; Pitchford and Wright 2012).
11
The literature also suggests that defaults have dire political consequences for incumbent governments and finance ministers (Borensztein and
Panizza, 2009).

8

There is a sizable empirical literature that estimates different types of fiscal multipliers for
different regions or countries, in different stages of the cycle, and with different methodologies.
Although to our knowledge there are no precise estimates for Puerto Rico, the literature offers
valuable insights for assessing what assumptions are sensible at the moment of studying the
consequences of a fiscal plan for the island. This section offers a brief review of the main findings
from that literature. Some of the finds of the empirical literature are that (i) fiscal multipliers are
state-dependent; 12 (ii) there are negative endogenous feedback effects from fiscal contractions 13;
and (iii) fiscal multipliers depend on the exchange rate regime: Consistent with the predictions
from economic theory, the empirical literature finds that they are larger in economies operating
under predetermined exchange rates than under flexible exchange rates 14.
A simple corollary of the multipliers’ state-dependence is that there is uncertainty about
the values of multipliers in a particular economy at a particular time. Certainly, there is no precise
knowledge about the correct distributions for the values of multipliers for Puerto Rico.
Extrapolating values found for US regions or other economies may be of help, but an analysis for
Puerto Rico must take into account that the territory is currently in a deep recession and faces the
possibility of large out-migration, so that multipliers are likely to be larger than what is obtained
for US regions in more “normal” recessions.

12
Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012b, 2012c), using regime-switching models, estimate the effects of fiscal policies over the business cycle and
find that fiscal policy is considerably more effective in recessions than expansions. They provide estimates for multipliers for disaggregate spending
variables for US regions. Military spending has the largest multiplier: estimates range from 3.69, with standard error of 0.83 (Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko, 2012c) to 1.67, with standard error of 0.72 (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012b). The estimates for non-defense spending
multipliers range from 1.34, with standard error of 0.31, to 1.09, with the same standard error. These values demonstrate the effect of $1 of additional
spending on output; for example, according to Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012c) an additional dollar of public spending in the non-defense
sector increases output by $1.34. In the expansion, the defense spending multiplier changes sign: it ranges from -1.03, with standard error of 0.25
(Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012c), to -0.43, with standard error of 0.24 (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012b). And the non-defense spending
multiplier keeps the positive sign but the magnitudes are smaller: it ranges from 1.17, with standard error of 0.15 (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko,
2012c), to 1.03, with the same standard error (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012b). Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012a) also estimate fiscal
multipliers for OECD economies. The effects in recessions are stronger for this group of economies: Their point estimate is that an increase of
government purchases of $1 results in about $3.50 of added GDP when the economy is weak, with a 90 percent confidence interval running from
0.6 to 6.3. On the other hand, in times of a strong economy, added government purchases reduce GDP, according to the point estimate. The
confidence interval for that estimate includes moderate positive values. In all those estimates, the effects of fiscal policies are not necessarily
concentrated in one year, but can be accumulated over time. The IMF has also recognized the importance of considering the non-linear nature of
multipliers (Blanchard and Leigh, 2013). This recognition received special attention as the calls for a reconsideration of the methodology for
assessing debt sustainability and the assumptions on multipliers had intensified after the dramatic consequences that the underestimation of the
impact of fiscal austerity had for Greece, and also for other European economies in distress (see Guzman and Heymann, 2015). Another estimate
is provided by Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), who using historical data on military procurement to estimate the effects of government spending,
obtain a so-called “open economy relative multiplier” of approximately 1.5 – the “open economy relative multiplier” estimates the effects on output
that an increase in government spending in one region of the union relative to another, and differs from the “closed economy aggregate multiplier”
that is estimated using aggregate US data. More recently, Chodorow-Reich (2017), based on an analysis of the American Recovery Reinvestment
Act and of a survey of empirical studies, suggests that his “preferred” point estimate of the cross-sectional fiscal spending to output multiplier lies
around 1.8.
13
Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012b, 2012c) also offer evidence on the impulse-responses regarding the effects of an increase in public spending
on tax revenues. For non-defense spending, the tax revenues response to an increase in $1 ranges from $0 to $1. See the Figure A.3 in the appendix
of Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012c) and the Figure A.3 in the appendix of Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012b).
14
See Ilzetki, Mendoza, and Végh (2012).

The uncertainty about the values of the multipliers has practical implications for an analysis
of debt sustainability and for the study of the consequences of a fiscal plan. It makes sensitivity
analysis with respect to the baseline assumptions an especially necessary part of the exercise. Our
analysis will include a sensitivity analysis that refers to the ranges of estimates that we report in
this section.

THE STOCHASTIC NATURE OF THE DSA
Given that any analysis is made under uncertainty, the implication is that the assessment
of debt sustainability must be stochastic (see IMF, 2013; Celasun, Debrun, and Ostry, 2006;
Consiglio and Zenios, 2015, 2017; Guzman and Heymann, 2015; Guzman and Lombardi, 2017).
There may be multiple states of nature, and each state of nature will have a different associated
intertemporal budget constraint. This is why we assess debt sustainability from a stochastic
perspective, requiring only that there the condition of debt sustainability holds with a high
probability.

2.B EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON DEBT REDUCTION AND MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
The empirical evidence is consistent with our earlier analysis suggesting that debt relief
has beneficial economic effects for debtor countries. Reinhart and Trebesch (2016) examine the
economic performance of debtor countries during and after sovereign debt relief operations, for
samples that cover the periods 1920-1939 for defaults on official (government to government) debt
and 1978-2010 for emerging markets defaults with private creditors. They find that per capita GDP
increases 11 percent for emerging markets and 20 percent for advanced economies during the five
years following a restructuring that results in exiting from the state of default. They also find a
strong increase in average ratings for emerging markets – a result predicted by economic theory,
as the market perceptions of debt sustainability should improve if the debt restructuring is effective
in resolving the debt crisis. Besides, debt levels decline strongly following the exit of crises. Within
five years, total government debt/GDP falls by 27 percentage points across emerging market
episodes and by 22 percentage points in the sample of defaults with official creditors. However,
they find that not every type of restructuring is associated with improvements in economic

10

performance and ratings: the effects are significant only in deals that involve face value reductions.
Reprofiling deals, such as operations with maturity extensions and interest reductions, were not
associated with improvements in economic performance.
Recent commentaries and research have made the mistake of looking at what has been the
average in past restructurings as a guide for appropriate future debt policies (Edwards 2015a,
2015b). But what has been the norm in recent practice must instead be taken as representative of
what is unacceptable. The amount of relief that distressed countries have obtained has generally
been insufficient to resolve debt crises. Indeed, restructurings are coming in the form of “too little
and too late” (cf. Guzman, Ocampo, and Stiglitz, 2016). From 1970 to 2010, between 49.9% and
60% of sovereign debt restructurings with private creditors were followed by another restructuring
or default within 3 to 7 years, respectively (Guzman and Lombardi, 2017, based on data from
Cruces and Trebesch, 2013), what suggests that restructuring processes have too often been
ineffective at providing enough relief to restore debt sustainability with high probability.
Among the successful cases, two stand out – at least in terms of their magnitude and the
attention they have received in the literature. One of them is the case of West Germany following
World War II. West Germany obtained significant debt relief through the London Debt Agreement
(LDA). The case is studied by Galofré-Vilà et al. (2016), who conclude that West Germany’s
spectacular recovery would have not been possible without the LDA. The significant debt writedown released resources for fiscal policies that allowed the pursuing of the public policies that the
recovery required. Absent such a relief, West Germany would have been forced to obtain sizable
fiscal surpluses that would not only have undermined the recovery, but would also have fostered
political instability, potentially renewed geopolitical conflict, and ultimately be economically selfdefeating.
The other case was Argentina’s debt restructuring following the default of 2001 – the
largest recorded sovereign default in history at the time. The country followed a strategy that
resulted in significant debt relief (see Basualdo et al. (2015); Guzman (2016); Chodos (2016); and
Cruces and Samples (2016) for details), which created space for fiscal policies that played a crucial
role in the fast and large recovery that the country experienced following the default. 15 However,
15
In a context of favorable international conditions and under the implementation of a policy of competitive and effectively multiple real exchange
rates, GDP grew more than 8 percent on average from 2003 until the eruption of the global financial crisis in 2008 (see also Damill, Frenkel, and

11

the country also got immersed in a complex legal dispute with holdout bondholders – bondholders
who decide to not cooperate in restructuring negotiations even when a large majority accepts the
proposal of the debtor – including the so-called vulture funds who bought debt at a low fraction of
its face value when it was already in default, sued the country in US courts seeking full payment
and won, blocking the finalization of the restructuring process and also the country’s access to
international credit markets for more than a decade. The case is also telling of the complexities of
resolving debt crisis under severe gaps in the legal frameworks.
Among the recent unsuccessful cases, Greece stands out. The case is extensively analyzed by
Varoufakis (2016). The management of Greece’s ongoing debt crisis is an example of too little
and too late. After a few years of recession and of an unsustainable debt position, the country
restructured its debt in 2012. But the restructuring was not effective to restore debt sustainability.
It came with conditions of fiscal austerity imposed by the Troika that undermined the possibility
of escaping the recession. The draconian demands have continued since then. The Troika later
imposed a program for reducing Greece’s public debt to GDP ratio that included a target of primary
surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP for 2015, and 4.5 percent of GDP from 2015 onwards, forever.
Predictably, such a program has not restored Greece to prosperity. The country continues to
struggle, and throughout this period, opportunities have vanished for many Greeks. The
unemployment rate was 7 percent in 2008 and skyrocketed since then, growing higher than 25
percent; it was 23 percent in 2016. Youth unemployment statistics are even more alarming. The
youth unemployment rate peaked at 60 percent in 2013, then declined to 47 percent at the time of
this study after many migrated or stopped looking for jobs.

where 𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌,𝐺𝐺 is the public spending to real GNP multiplier and 𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌,𝑇𝑇;𝑡𝑡 is the fiscal revenues to real

GNP multiplier.

The component 𝛥𝛥𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝐶𝐶 denotes the necessary change in tax revenues to compensate the initial
variation due to the change in public spending in year 𝑡𝑡:

𝛥𝛥𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝐶𝐶 = −𝛼𝛼𝑇𝑇,𝐺𝐺;𝑡𝑡 𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡

where 𝛼𝛼 𝑇𝑇,𝐺𝐺;𝑡𝑡 is the public spending to fiscal revenues multiplier that denotes the endogenous

feedback effect that a contraction of public spending creates on fiscal revenues through the fall in
economic activity. 16
Informed by the literature (see section 2.A above), we project the real and nominal GNP

for each possible combination of the following parameters: 𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌,𝐺𝐺 = {1,1.34,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5},
𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌,𝑇𝑇 = {0,0.5,1,1.34}, and 𝜀𝜀𝑇𝑇,𝐺𝐺 = {0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7} where 𝜀𝜀𝑇𝑇,𝐺𝐺 is the elasticity of
fiscal revenues to public spending,

𝜀𝜀𝑇𝑇,𝐺𝐺 = −𝛼𝛼𝑇𝑇,𝐺𝐺;𝑡𝑡

We are making a conservative assumption for the tax revenues to real GNP multiplier, under the
premise that part of the increases in tax revenues will fall on agents with low marginal propensities
to consume. Our projections would be more pessimistic if we chose the same range for 𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌,𝑇𝑇 as for
𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌,𝐺𝐺 . 17

16
The latter multiplier includes the time sub-index t, because we assume constant values for the elasticities of fiscal revenues to public spending,
hence the multiplier will vary over time with the variations in the fiscal revenues to public spending ratio.
17
Not all the measures on the fiscal revenues side will lead to a reduction of Puerto Ricans’ spending. For instance, while the Fiscal Plan plans to
replace Act 154 by taxes that would achieve the current revenues over the next decade, if Act 154 was replaced with a tax that is paid by
multinationals there would be no associated depressing effect on Puerto Rico’s economy. Our conservative range of assumptions for the multiplier

combinations of parameters that can be defined as “scenarios”. We project real and nominal GNP
for each of those 192 scenarios.

3. AN ANALYSIS OF THE FISCAL PLAN 2017-2026 18
In this section, we examine the macroeconomic implications of Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Plan
that had been approved for fiscal years 2017-18 to 2026-27, as it is a crucial element for a
computation of Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. The Fiscal Plan presented by the
Government of Puerto Rico had been certified by the Oversight Board on March 13, 2017.
The plan includes a detailed path of policies, including spending and tax policies as well
as structural reforms. It offers a projection of the effects of those policies on Puerto Rico’s GNP
for the ten-year period under a set of assumptions regarding the macroeconomic effects of fiscal
policies, the effects of the structural reforms, the migration flows, the baseline growth rate of GNP
(that describes the scenario that would prevail in absence of new policy measures), and the inflation
rate.

of tax revenues on output accounts for the possibility of a less depressing effect of revenues measures relative to public spending measures. It must
be noted, however, that there is uncertainty about Act 154 being replaced by a scheme that has no cost on Puerto Ricans. This will depend on
Federal policies that are beyond Puerto Rico’s reach, which adds a layer of uncertainty to the projections of the effects of the Fiscal Plan. This
uncertainty is indeed a matter of major concern. Makoff and Setser (2017) explain that “how Puerto Rico will do so [Act 154 will eventually be
replaced by a set of taxes that maintain current levels of revenue over the next 10 years] is a great mystery: nobody has explained how Puerto Rico
will continue to collect the same amount of revenue from the tax-allergic multinational corporations if federal forbearance on credibility lapses.”

On the demand side, the program is characterized by fiscal contraction over the entire
decade but mainly concentrated in years 2018 and 2019. Regarding the structural reforms, the plan
features four packages that are classified as (i) improve the ease of business activity, (ii) improve
capital efficiency, (iii) energy reform, and (iv) promoting economic development. The concrete
measures include (textually reproduced from the approved Fiscal Plan, p. 23):
•

Institute public policy measures aimed to attract new businesses, create new employment
opportunities, and foster private sector employment growth to increase labor demand.

•

Change welfare and labor incentives to encourage greater sector participation, thus
increasing labor supply.

•

Centralize, streamline, and modernize and expedite permitting processes; increase business
friendly environmental and economic growth.

•

Lower marginal tax rates and broaden the tax base; simplify and optimize the existing tax
code to achieve gains in efficiency, ease of doing business and reducing tax evasion.

•

Reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens to reduce the drag of government on the private
sector.

•

Augmenting competitiveness by investing in critical infrastructure and quality of public
services in roads, ports, telecommunications, water and waste, knowledge services, and
other strategically important sectors. 19

•

Leverage key public assets through long-term concessions to optimize quality of public
infrastructure, services to public and sustainable operations and maintenance.

•

Implement management system to boost development of critical projects through expedited
processes.

•

Leverage and facilitate expedited private sector investments in modern, cost- efficient, and
environmentally compliant energy infrastructure; reform PREPA operations and services
to clients; and allow for greater competition in energy generation.

•

Promote productivity growth, attract FDI & incentivize investments in technology through
collaboration with the private sector.

•

Externalize the overseeing of marketing efforts & continuity under a single brand and as a
unified front representing all of Puerto Rico’s tourism components.

19

Public investments do not only affect supply formation but also have demand multiplier effects.

As publicly reported, the plan assumes that the multiplier associated with fiscal contractions will
be 1.34, which means that every dollar of contraction in the primary surplus will be associated
with a fall in GNP of 1.34 dollars. The Fiscal Plan assumes baseline real GNP growth rates for the

absence of the Plan’s changes in policy). 20

The plan also assumes that the effects of the structural reforms will kick in by 2022 and will make
a contribution to real GNP growth as described in Table 4.

ANALYSIS OF THE FISCAL PLAN ASSUMPTIONS AND PROPOSALS
Our analysis of the fiscal plan detects a number of issues in its design:
(I) The plan is based on assumptions that are not aligned with economic theory or evidence, thus
it fails to appropriately recognize the magnitude of the destabilizing dynamics that it would create.
(II) The plan falls short on presenting a debt restructuring and sustainability analysis, and as we
have already explained, such an analysis is essential for making reasonable growth forecasts.
Instead, it simply specifies what is the amount that must be repaid to creditors during the next
decade, without being explicit about the longer-term obligations that the island will face and their
sustainability.
We discuss each of these in turn. Specifically:
20

These assumptions were made by the Fiscal Board and accepted by Puerto Rico’s government.

17

1. The values of fiscal multipliers used for the GNP projections are overoptimistic.
The value for the multiplier associated with the fiscal contraction of 1.34 is close to the lowerbound of the estimates corresponding to times of recession, as described in the review of the
literature in section 3. That value corresponds to estimates for US regions in recessions, 21 but
Puerto Rico is suffering a depression that is deeper than a “normal” recession. Multipliers are
likely to be larger for deep recessions. This is especially so in the case of Puerto Rico, given the
likely effect of a deep recession on migration. 22 And even if the assumption is considered sensible,
a robust plan needs to consider the consequences of deviations from it. It is not only the point
estimate what matters, but also the distribution.

2. The endogenous feedback effects that the fall in economic activity would have on fiscal
revenues are not taken into account.
Ignoring the effects that the fall in economic activity would have on tax revenues leads to an
underestimation of the contractionary impact of the proposed fiscal policies. Implicitly, the
projections assume that the elasticity of public spending on tax revenues is zero – as tax revenues
fall as the economy contracts, to meet the fiscal targets, public expenditures have to fall. But this
induced contraction of expenditures then has a further contractionary effect. The Board’s analysis
seems to have ignored these feedback effects. 23

3. The plan assumes that the territory will begin to experience a recovery starting in 2022
entirely because of structural reforms that mostly affect the supply side. This assumption
goes against sound macroeconomic theory, because Puerto Rico’s economy is a demandconstrained regime.
In a supply-constrained regime, structural reforms that remove obstacles to supply formation will
likely have expansionary effects. But Puerto Rico’s economy is in a demand-constrained regime.
Thus, the assumption that supply-side reforms will be the driver of economic recovery is not well-

21
The definition of a recession comes from a calibration that is consistent with the duration of recessions according to the NBER business cycle
dates since 1946.
22
While migration is likely to reduce the need for certain categories of government expenditures, these effects are likely to be overwhelmed by the
effects on the territory’s income and tax revenues.
23
If it did take those endogenous feedback effects into account, this would mean that the multiplier associated with the contraction in spending
assumed by the plan is not 1.34 but lower.

18

founded. On the contrary, any spending-reducing reform as cuts in pensions will more likely
deepen the recession in the short-term.

4. The assumption on migration flows assume that migration pressures will not intensify with
the projected contraction in economic activity.
Puerto Rico’s population has declined from approximately 3.8 million in 2000 to a little more than
3.4 million in 2016. Between 2010 and 2016, the annual rate of population contraction exceeded
1%, and reached 1.8% in 2016. A deeper recession – as anticipated by the Board’s plan – will
further decrease opportunities in the island, fueling more migration to the mainland. And yet the
plan assumes that the migration flows will taper off, with the population declining by only 0.2%
per year over the 2017-2026 period. This is an unrealistic assumption. 24
An intensification of migration outflows as a result of the contractionary effects of the Plan would
accelerate the fall in fiscal revenues. Then, to achieve the revenue targets stated in the Fiscal Plan,
the adjustments would need to be larger – but that would trigger further contractions in economic
activity and would increase the per capita burden for those remaining in the island, leading to a
destabilizing dynamic that the Fiscal Plan fails to recognize.

5. The plan does not present a proposal for debt restructuring.
The plan simply states what is the amount that must be repaid to creditors during the next decade,
but it falls short on the specifics of a restructuring plan as, for instance, on the amount of relief that
the territory will have to obtain to restore debt sustainability. This is a mistake, because the
possibilities that the territory will face in terms of fiscal policies are contingent on the restructuring
it achieves; and those fiscal policies in turn will affect output, employment, migration, and tax
revenues.

24

Makoff and Setser (2017) provide a detailed analysis of Puerto Rico’s migration dynamics in its recent history and argue that the Fiscal Plan’s
assumptions on migration over the next decade are off. In their words: “Something is off here. How does the economy drop by 12 percent over 10
years and the population by only two percent? How does the rate of net migration improve from its current run rate of -2 percent a year to only 0.2 percent a year at the same time that the island is being hit by a significant cut in jobs and services? Absent a miraculous shift in household
sentiment, Puerto Rico’s population will certainly fall by more than the plan projects.” (Makoff and Setser (2017), p.16.). They also observe that
the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics reported that the new Census Bureau outmigration projection for the next 10 years is 1.4 percent annually.

19

There is a sixth issue that deserves attention. The annual growth rates of nominal and real GNP
are assumed to reach 2.6% and 1% respectively in 2026. It is not specified whether these
assumptions correspond to a steady state. 25 Assumptions about future growth obviously affect the
sustainability of the debt after 2026; market perceptions about debt sustainability obviously affect
the interest rates the territory will have to pay; and this in turn affects (for reasons already
explained) the territory’s macroeconomics.

Finally, the exercise of projecting the effects of public policies needs to take into account that there
is uncertainty about the values that the relevant parameters and the magnitude of the shocks that
the island will experience. The sensitivity analysis, where changes in the assumptions are analyzed,
must be part of the projection analysis. We next engage into such an exercise.

PROJECTIONS: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
In order to address the limitations of the Fiscal Plan’s forecasts, we conduct a sensitivity
analysis of the expected implied macroeconomic dynamics. This allows us to construct more
realistic scenarios of Puerto Rico’s debt restructuring needs. We project the trajectories under
alternative assumptions for fiscal multipliers described in Section 2.A above, maintaining the same
assumptions of the Fiscal Plan for the trajectory of baseline real GNP growth and the annual
inflation rates until 2026. We maintain those assumptions because our initial goal is to assess how
the GNP projections react to changes in the values of the fiscal multipliers. We assume that the
component of the fiscal primary balance that corresponds to the line “Measures” in Table 1 is the
“unanticipated” component of the fiscal policy, to which the multipliers apply – the Fiscal Plan
assumes the same.
Our choice of parameters for the multipliers 𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌,𝐺𝐺 , 𝛼𝛼𝑌𝑌,𝑇𝑇 , and the elasticity 𝜀𝜀𝑇𝑇,𝐺𝐺 results in 192

combinations of parameters that can be defined as “scenarios”. We project real and nominal GNP

25
An additional concern, not analyzed in this study but in Makoff and Setser (2017), is that the baseline trend of Puerto Rico’s economy may be
worse than projected by the Fiscal Plan. They point out that while the Fiscal Plan takes a continued fall of the economy on its historic trend (about
1.5 percent a year since 2005) as the baseline scenario, this is a controversial assumption, “because the territory’s historic downward trajectory
likely would have been much worse if it were not for the billions of dollars injected into the economy through emergency federal transfers
(Obamacare, the American Recovery Act stimulus and the backdoor transfer provided by the federal tax treatment of Act 154), the commonwealth’s
aggressive debt financings (primarily general obligation, “GO,” and sales tax backed, “COFINA,” bonds), and the depletion of Puerto Rico’s public
pension plan assets to pay benefits.” (p.16).

20

for each of those 192 scenarios. Figure 1 shows the ranges of our projections, as well as and the
Fiscal Plan’s projections, for the real GDP, for two scenarios: in panel A, the Fiscal Plan’s
assumptions on the effects of structural reforms on GNP are maintained, while in panel B the
comparison is made under the assumption that the Fiscal Plan’s structural reforms have no effect
on GNP.

Figure 1
Panel A
Assuming the Fiscal Plan’s assumption on structural reforms hold

Panel B
Assuming structural reforms have no effect on GNP

Our projections strongly suggest that the Fiscal Plan’s projections are overoptimistic. They
lie on the most optimistic bound within the range of assumptions on the values of multipliers that
are aligned with the empirical evidence. The magnitude of the differences between our range of
projections and the projections of the Fiscal Plan is noticeably larger if we dismiss the positive
effects that the structural reforms are assumed to have on GNP by the Plan.
And even under those optimistic assumptions, the plan falls into an “austerity trap”: the
magnitude of the targets for primary surpluses leads to a decrease in GNP over a decade that is
larger than the reduction in the stock of debt, thus leading to an increase in the debt to GNP ratio
by 2026. If there was no reduction in the debt principal, and if missed payments either of interest
or principal were capitalized at zero interest rate, the total public debt to GNP ratio would rise
from 1.09 in 2016 to 1.41 in 2026 in the scenario projected by the Fiscal Plan. (It is this “austerity
trap” which has led to the dire outcomes in Greece, where, after its austerity program and after
21

successive debt restructurings, the debt GDP ratio is higher than it was in the beginning of the
crisis.)
And as figure 2 shows, the magnitude of the austerity trap will likely be larger, as the
projected debt to GNP ratio for 2026 is even larger in the large majority of the postulated scenarios.

True, the lower-bound of our projections corresponds to projections that may be too
pessimistic. Prospects will certainly be better if there is a restructuring that restores sustainability,

23

as the baseline growth rate of GNP would probably be larger if the debt position of the territory is
perceived as sustainable by market participants. But our projections call the attention on the deeply
negative consequences that the implementation of the Fiscal Plan could have for Puerto Rico’s
economy. And our projections still ignore the larger effects that the fall of economic activity could
have on migration outflows. 26

4. A COMPUTATION OF PUERTO RICO’S DEBT RELIEF NEEDS
In this section, we perform a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) that incorporates the
expected macroeconomic dynamics implied by the Fiscal Plan in order to compute Puerto Rico’s
restructuring needs. The analysis includes a computation of the amount of debt relief that is
required in order to restore Puerto Rico’s public debt sustainability. More specifically, we compute
the reduction in the value of Puerto Rico’s public debt that would make full repayment of the
restructured debt feasible, being consistent with the Fiscal Plan assumptions that the country will
achieve a real GNP growth rate of 1 percent in 2026, and that will settle on that rate as a steady
state.
Our DSA takes the premise that the Fiscal Plan will be respected. We assume that any
discrepancy between the Fiscal Plan’s GNP projections and realizations will be addressed in a way
that respects the schedule of debt payments – or equivalently, the schedule of cash after measures
available for debt service – established in the Fiscal Plan. Therefore, each projection will lead to
the same face value of debt in 2026, because by construction we force the economy to do whatever
it takes to reach the targets of fiscal revenues included in the Fiscal Plan. But each scenario will
be associated with different GNP trajectories, as shown in figures 1 to 4. Thus, for each of the 192
scenarios that are defined by the assumed range of fiscal multipliers, we obtain a different value
of the debt to GNP ratio for 2026, 𝑑𝑑 𝑖𝑖 , as depicted in figure 2.

For each of those 192 projected debt to GDP ratios, we need to respond the following questions:

26

The fiscal plan does not specify whether the output growth baseline assumptions already incorporate the effects of a planned debt restructuring.
If they do, the projections would be including the effects of a debt restructuring through the baseline assumptions instead of doing it through the
macroeconomic multipliers that would be associated with the need for lower primary fiscal surpluses. If the baseline assumptions already
incorporate the effects of an eventual restructuring, incorporating those effects in the macroeconomic multipliers would lead to an overestimation
of the beneficial effects of a restructuring—they would be counted twice. It is possible though to replicate the analysis under alternative (less
optimistic) baseline assumptions to deal with this possibility. All the codes for the projections are publicly available at
http://espaciosabiertos.org/analisis-de-alivio-de-deuda-para-sostenibilidad-del-pais/

24

(a) What path of primary fiscal surpluses would the economy require after 2027 to satisfy the
government’s IBC?
(b) Is that path economically feasible?
(c) If it is not, what is the size of the debt write-down that would make the satisfaction of the
government’s IBC feasible with high probability?
Answering these questions requires taking a stance on the relationship between fiscal policies and
GNP growth. We use exactly the same functional form that is used for the projections of the Fiscal
Plan, but as explained previously, we run the projections under a set of assumptions that include
those of the Fiscal Plan as well as others, informed by the empirical literature.
To perform the computations required to answer questions (a) to (c), we make the following
additional assumptions:

Assumption i. We take the value of the fiscal surplus to GNP ratio of 2026 as the new structural
fiscal balance for year 2027 – the first year for which there is no information from the Fiscal Plan.
This is an optimistic assumption—one that assumes that the reforms and policies included in the
plan will be as effective as assumed and will remain in place after 2026. If anything, this
assumption leads to an underestimation of Puerto Rico’s debt relief needs –consistently with our
strategy of making assumptions in each step of the analysis that imply that our computations of
the debt relief needs must be interpreted as lower bounds.

Assumption ii. With the same goal of making our computations a representation of lower-bounds,
we assume that the interest payments that are missed during the period 2017-2026 are capitalized
after being rolled-over to 2027 at zero interest rate.

Assumption iii. We assume that by 2027 the economy will have already settled on a trend of real
GNP growth rate of 1 percent, as predicted by the fiscal plan. We also assume that the inflation
rate will settle on a trend of 1.6 percent per year after 2026 – which is the inflation rate the Fiscal
Plan assumes for 2026. As discussed above, these are controversial assumptions. If the country
does not implement policies that push aggregate demand, the real and nominal growth targets will
25

likely not be met. Again, the goal is to err on the underestimation side of relief needs rather than
on the overestimation side.

Assumption iv. Finally, we assume that the nominal interest rate stabilizes at 6 percent after the
restructuring, which corresponds to a scenario of a risk free nominal interest rate of 3 percent,
recovery of sustainability with probability 95 percent, and recovery rate of 46 percent in case of
default. The online appendix presents the sensitivity analysis regarding this assumption. 27

THE DEBT STABILIZING PRIMARY FISCAL SURPLUS TO GNP RATIO
We search for the value of the debt stabilizing primary fiscal surplus to GNP ratio in a steady state
situation. We denote this variable in scenario 𝑖𝑖 as 𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖 , and it is defined as
𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖

(𝑅𝑅 − 𝑔𝑔𝐵𝐵 )
1 + 𝑔𝑔𝐵𝐵

where 𝑔𝑔𝐵𝐵 is the steady state nominal GNP growth, and, as defined before, 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 is the debt to GNP

ratio in scenario 𝑖𝑖, and 𝑅𝑅 is the nominal interest rate that corresponds to the situation where debt

has been stabilized. The debt stabilizing primary fiscal surplus denotes the value of the primary
fiscal surplus as a ratio of GNP that must be achieved to satisfy the government’s intertemporal
budget constraint. But that value may or may not be feasible, i.e. it may or may not be achievable
once we take into account the endogenous feedback effects between fiscal policies and economic
performance.

primary fiscal balance in absence of measures by the time the Fiscal Plan ends. From 2027
onwards, we do not take a stance on what component of the primary balance (revenues or
spending) will have to be adjusted in order to achieve the target of primary surplus defined for

each scenario. Therefore, we assume the same multipliers for tax revenues and public spending for

Computing 𝑠𝑠 𝑖𝑖 requires a series of iterations until the economy stabilizes on a path of constant

Results: The debt stabilizing primary fiscal surpluses to GNP and the evolution of debt to GNP
ratios
In the absence of restructuring, the debt included in the Fiscal Plan to GNP ratio would
have to stabilize at values from 1.04 (when 𝛼𝛼𝐺𝐺,𝑌𝑌 = 1.34, 𝛼𝛼𝐺𝐺,𝑇𝑇 = 0, 𝛼𝛼𝑇𝑇,𝑌𝑌 = 0) to 1.45 (when 𝛼𝛼𝐺𝐺,𝑌𝑌 =
3.5, 𝛼𝛼𝐺𝐺,𝑇𝑇 = 0.7, 𝛼𝛼 𝑇𝑇,𝑌𝑌 = −1.34), and the total public debt (net of Children’s Trust and HFO) to
28

For each public spending to real GNP multiplier, once we take into account the endogenous feedback effects from public spending contractions
on tax revenues, we can find a lower associated value of βi .
29
In essence, this procedure computes the fixed point that satisfies both equation (1) and the intertemporal budget constraint associated with each
scenario.

27

GNP ratio would have to stabilize at values from 1.38 to 2.04. The lower bound of 1.04
corresponds to 𝑠𝑠 = 0.035, and the upper bound corresponds to 𝑠𝑠 = 0.074. Under the Fiscal Plan

assumptions, those ratios take values of 1.08 and 1.43 respectively, and in 2026 they take values
of 1.04 and 1.36 respectively.
Therefore, in absence of any relief, Puerto Rico would need to achieve primary fiscal

surpluses between 3.5% and 7.4% of GNP after the end of the Fiscal Plan, forever. Under the
Fiscal Plan’s assumptions, the primary surpluses after 2028 would have to be 3.5% or 4.7% of
GNP, forever, depending on whether the relevant debt stock is the one included in the Fiscal Plan
or the total public debt net of Children’s Trust and HFO. Table 5 summarizes these findings.

Table 5: Debt-stabilizing primary fiscal surplus, 𝑅𝑅 = 0.06, 𝑔𝑔𝐵𝐵 = 0.026

ON THE FEASIBLE PRIMARY FISCAL BALANCE PATHS
The functional form (1) used for the Fiscal Plan projections relates the growth rate of GNP
to the change in the primary surplus, but it does not relate it to the level of the primary surplus.
Thus, according to their model, even if the government is forced to sustain primary surpluses of 7
percent of GNP forever, that would not affect the (growth) performance of the economy in the
long term. The only period in which economic activity would be affected would be the one in
which the large contraction to achieve the target of 7 percent occurs.
But such premise is, of course, not valid over the entire range of primary surplus levels.
The need to maintain massive primary surpluses for a long time would have significant effects on
the possibilities of the government to make investments in infrastructure, health, or human capital,
or to implement other development policies. A draconian plan as requiring constant primary
surpluses between 3.5 to 7.4 percent of GNP would entail drastic permanent cuts to spending in
these areas, and that would have long term effects. The targets would likely be inconsistent with
the baseline assumption of convergence to a real GNP growth rate of 1%. (Moreover, such
28

draconian measures would further encourage migration, making the growth targets even more
unrealistic.)
The IMF DSA framework and its fan charts approach provide a helpful basis for
complementing our analysis. IMF (2011) recognizes that sustained large surpluses are not
common, and incorporates this constraint in its debt sustainability analyses; it reports that out of a
sample of 87 countries, only 16 countries (less than 20 percent) sustained primary surpluses
exceeding 5 percent of GDP for five years or longer. Some of these episodes of sustained large
surpluses were related to specific conditions that are not easily applicable to most countries. Out
of the 16 countries that recorded episodes of sustained surpluses, five had this performance in
connection to exogenous factors—large increases in revenues related to natural resources
(Botswana, Chile, Egypt, and Uzbekistan) or transfers arising from customs union membership
(Lesotho). Episodes of sustained large surpluses in the absence of facilitating exogenous factors
have been limited to 11 countries (13 percent of the sample). And a few of these countries ran
large primary surpluses in the absence of a large debt burden (Denmark, New Zealand, Turkey).
The ones that sustained surpluses exceeding 5 percent of GDP for five years or longer at times
where debt levels were above 60 percent of GDP were Belgium, Canada, Dominica, Israel,
Jamaica, Panama, Seychelles, and Singapore. And no country targeted those values forever.
Besides, there is no evidence that supports the premise that targeting those high primary
fiscal surpluses has been associated with recoveries in situations of distress. Indeed, four of those
eight economies faced situations that are significantly different from that of the debt distress Puerto
Rico is facing (Belgium, Canada, Israel, and Singapore were in situations where austerity could
ensure the sustainability of the public sector without triggering a self-defeating macroeconomic
process. For instance, Canada had the good fortune of having a flexible exchange rate regime and
having its major trading partner, the US, experience a boom.). While Dominica combined a debt
restructuring in 2004 with an average primary fiscal surplus of 3.9 percent of GDP for the period
2004-2008, it had only an average fiscal surplus of 1.19 during the decade that followed the
restructuring; Jamaica has been keeping sizable primary fiscal surpluses since its last debt
restructuring in 1990, on average of 7.48 of GDP, and the economy has suffered the consequences:
the unemployment rate has kept at two digits for almost the entire period, and the government’s
debt to GDP ratio is at about the same levels now as in 1990, above 120 per cent; Panama combined
two debt restructuring episodes in 1994 and 1996 with an average primary fiscal surplus of 1.08
29

percent of GDP in the decade that followed the latter restructuring; and Seychelles combined a
debt restructuring in 2010 with an average primary fiscal surplus of 5.98 percent of GDP during
the period 2010-2015 – in a context of significant increases in the prices of its exports.
Most important, the primary surplus is an endogenous outcome; if a country recovers due
to the implementation of an appropriate mix of policies that include a debt restructuring, obtaining
primary surpluses becomes a more likely outcome.
In summary, while there is no evidence that suggests that a country in a situation of debt
distress, in a demand-constrained regime, can do well by avoiding a restructuring through the
achievement of very large primary fiscal surpluses, there is evidence that long periods of large
primary fiscal surpluses are very rare, and that a restructuring has been almost always ultimately
unavoidable under those circumstances.
We conclude that if Puerto Rico’s government needs to collect primary surpluses in the
order of 3.5% to 7.4% of GNP after 2027 forever, this means that Puerto Rico’s debt is almost
surely unsustainable, and that it needs to be restructured to a level where the required path of
primary fiscal surpluses becomes feasible.

COMPUTING THE NECESSARY DEBT RELIEF TO RESTORE DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
The debt position that can be deemed as sustainable with high probability depends on the
path of fiscal policies that are considered feasible.
To compute the necessary relief to restore sustainability, we first compute the stabilizing
debt to GNP ratio for values of 𝑠𝑠 from the value that corresponds to each of our projections for

2026, 𝑠𝑠2026 (the range of these values goes from 0.012 to 0.016) to a maximum of 0.035. Next, we
calculate the necessary relief for restoring sustainability as the difference between the debt to GNP
ratio

We perform these computations for two groups of scenarios:

First, we assume that the Fiscal Plan’s assumptions on the effects of the structural
reforms on GNP hold.

Second, we assume that the structural reforms stated in the Fiscal Plan have no effects
on GNP growth during the period 2017-2026.

The results are summarized in figures 3 to 8 and in tables 6 to 11. The results show the
necessary face value reduction in the different scenarios under analysis for restoring debt
sustainability, assuming the debt service scheduled in the Fiscal Plan will be respected, and not
taking into account the devastating effects of the hurricanes Maria and Irma as well as the effects
of the Federal aid as a response to those natural disasters.

To reach a conclusion on the necessary relief needs for Puerto Rico, we need to take a
stance on the set of feasible values of 𝑠𝑠. Even under the most optimistic projections the economy
is projected to have a lower GNP in 2026 than in 2016, and as was described above, the projected
debt to GNP ratio absent a restructuring is projected to be larger. The Fiscal Plan projects the
evolution of primary fiscal surplus to GNP ratios that is described in Table 12. Requiring a larger
𝑠𝑠 after 2027 than the values of 𝑠𝑠2026 would not be a sensible stance; the economy is projected to

be in worse in shape 2027 than at the moment we perform this analysis, hence being even more
ambitious in terms of the fiscal targets would not lead to better outcomes than the ones projected
for the next decade. Instead, being overly ambitious with the primary fiscal surplus targets would
most likely lead to another lost decade after 2027.

Table 12: Fiscal Plan projections of primary fiscal surpluses to GNP ratio, 2017-2026

Source: Fiscal Plan 2017-2026

For a stable primary fiscal surplus after 2027 that takes values between 𝑠𝑠2026 and 1.5

percent of GNP, the necessary debt reduction includes the full cancellation of interest payments
not scheduled for repayment in the Fiscal Plan plus a face value reduction that under the Fiscal

Plan assumptions would have to be between 44.4 percent and 63 percent if the relevant debt stock
37

is $51.9 billions (table 6, column “Face value reduction under Fiscal Plan multiplier
assumptions”), and between 60.1 percent and 73.4 percent if the relevant debt stock is $72.2
billions (table 7, column “Face value reduction under Fiscal Plan multiplier assumptions”). Under
a broader range of assumptions that include different values for the fiscal multipliers and under
the assumption of no effects of structural reforms on GNP growth, the debt reduction would have
to include the full cancellation of interest payments not included in the Fiscal Plan plus a face
value reduction of between 46.6 and 72 percent if the relevant debt stock is the one included in the
Fiscal Plan of $51.9 billions (Table 8, column “Min Face Value Reduction” for 𝑠𝑠 = 0.015 and

column “Max Face Value Reduction” for 𝑠𝑠 = 𝑠𝑠2026, respectively), or between 61.6 and 79.9

percent if the relevant debt stock is the figure of $72.2 billions that we achieve once we take into
account other debts not included in the Fiscal Plan (Table 9, column “Min Face Value Reduction”
for 𝑠𝑠 = 0.015 and column “Max Face Value Reduction” for 𝑠𝑠 = 𝑠𝑠2026 , respectively). Clearly,

Puerto Rico needs substantial relief. But the interpretation of these results must take into account
important caveats, to which we next turn our attention.

INTERPRETATION OF OUR RESULTS
Our computations show that in order to restore debt sustainability with high probability the
restructuring will have to deliver a substantial reduction of Puerto Rico’s debt. The figures we
presented are “macroeconomic” figures that do not establish how the debt write-off should be
distributed across the different bond series. And these are conservative estimates due to a number
of reasons.
First, throughout we have kept all the computations the Fiscal Plan’s assumption that
annual real GNP growth will reach 1 percent in 2027, and we assume that this will correspond to
a new steady state. But if the Fiscal Plan 2017-2026 is respected, for the reasons discussed in this
study, getting to that state will be an unlikely outcome. If no expansionary aggregate demand
policies are implemented to escape out of the current depression, the necessary relief to restore
sustainability will have to be even larger. Puerto Rico has no debt service capacity today, and if it
does not recover, it will not improve its payment capacity in the future either.
Second, as we described above, in every step of our analysis we made conservative
assumptions as to err on the “too little” side of debt relief.
38

A final caveat is that we do not study how the write-off will be distributed, and this is an
issue that will have macroeconomic effects. The expansionary effects of the restructuring will be
increasing in the fraction of the write-off that falls on external bondholders, rather than on domestic
bondholders, as the marginal propensity to spend in Puerto Rico’s economy is lower for external
than for domestic bondholders. The evidence supports this basic theoretical insight, as it shows
that the macroeconomic costs of a default are increasing in the proportion of debt held by domestic
residents (see Alessandro, 2011; Guembel and Sussman, 2014) and are highly related to the
transmission through the balance sheets of domestic banks (cf. Gennaioli, Martin, and Rossi,
2014). 30

GNP LINKED BONDS
A non-contingent debt relief is always exposed to the risk that ex-post the relief ends being
“too little” – harming the recovery – or “too much” – implying that creditors could have got more
without undermining sustainability. To deal with the uncertainty that is present at the time of the
restructuring, the debt restructuring could include GNP growth linked bonds, that relate the debt
payments to the evolution of the territory’s GNP. These instruments would improve sustainability,
as the payments would be related to the payment capacity of the debtor; and they would also align
the interests of creditors and the debtor, as both would benefit from a larger recovery. The
economic rationale has been largely developed in the literature. 31
Despite their virtues, the implementation of this type of contingent debt has not been
straightforward. In practice, securities with a return linked to economic growth have been issued
only in the context of a few debt restructurings, including those in Bulgaria (1994), Argentina
(2005) 32, Greece (2012), and Ukraine (2015). To date, no advanced economy has issued growth-

30

There are important binding constraints for designing a selective default strategy that requires targeting the bondholdings of foreigners, as these
bonds are actively traded in secondary markets (see Broner, Martin, and Ventura, 2010; Broner and Ventura, 2011). However, the transfer from
domestic bondholders to the territory that the restructuring would entail will still be expansionary in the short run if the government uses the funds
for policies that have a larger macroeconomic expansionary effect. And the larger space for public policies can also have positive long-term
consequences.

See Borensztein and Mauro (2004) for a review, and Barr, Bush, and Pienkowski (2014) for a more recent contribution, as well as Robert Shiller’s
related proposal to create “macro markets” for GDP-linked securities (Shiller, 1993, 2003).
32
Argentina implemented a variant of known as GDP warrants. But the results of the experiment were ambiguous. On the one hand, the warrants
paid off extremely well, benefitting the creditors who kept them in their portfolios. But on the other hand, they were not well received by markets
at the time of issuance. This may have had to do with their complex design, that made pricing difficult: the trigger for the payment was a threshold
growth rate of GDP, but the formula for the amount of payments depended on the difference between the actual level of GDP and a threshold level
(see Cruces and Samples (2016), Guzman (2016), and Benford, Best, and Joy (2016) for details).

Mauro, and Acalin, 2016).

5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper made two main contributions that intend to shed light on the island’s debt
restructuring needs. First, we examined the consequences of the Fiscal Plan for the period 20172026 and identified a number of problems with its assumptions. Second, our analysis informs what
are the actual restructuring needs of the country.
