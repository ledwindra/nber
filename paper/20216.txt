ABSTRACT
We posit the problem of an autocrat who has to allocate access to the executive positions in his inner
circle and define the career profile of his own insiders. Statically, granting access to an executive post
to a more experienced subordinate increases political returns to the post, but is more threatening to
the leader in case of a coup. Dynamically, the leader monitors the capacity of staging a coup by his
subordinates, which grows over time, and the incentives of trading a subordinate’s own position for
a potential shot at the leadership, which defines the incentives of staging a palace coup for each member
of the inner circle. We map these theoretical elements into structurally estimable hazard functions
of terminations of cabinet ministers for a panel of postcolonial Sub-Saharan African countries. The
hazard functions initially increase over time, indicating that most government insiders quickly wear
out their welcome, and then drop once the minister is fully entrenched in the current regime. We argue
that the survival concerns of the leader in granting access to his inner circle can cover much ground
in explaining the widespread lack of competence of African governments and the vast heterogeneity
of political performance between and within these regimes.

Introduction
Recent African economic history is replete with political failure (Herbst, 2000). Some of it

has been ascribed to a political class that is both rapacious and myopic, much like the roving
bandits à la Olson (2000) or the African predatory o¢ cials described in Shleifer and Vishny
(1993). This paper shows how the very nature of the threats to a leader’s survival that arise
from allowing government insiders su¢ ciently long time horizons may be an essential part
of the problem. In particular, we focus on positions of national prominence, such as cabinet
posts1 .
The paper studies the political survival of national cabinet members in a panel of subSaharan African (SSA) countries. Our goal is to provide a unique perspective on the internal
organization of autocratic regimes in Africa. In Section 2 we begin by uncovering a novel
set of stylized facts based on a newly collected data set featuring the annual composition
of national cabinets in a large set of SSA countries. First, we show that leaders with more
experience in government (in terms of number of years in which they are observed in past
executive positions before taking o¢ ce) tend to hire ministers with more experience (again
proxied by number of years in previous cabinets). In addition, leaders systematically select
more experienced ministers for more senior posts within their inner circle. We also report
novel regularities concerning the survival in o¢ ce of both SSA leaders and ministers, showing
that for both groups hazard rates are time-varying. While leaders face decreasing hazards
of termination over time, extending earlier work by Bienen and Van De Walle (1989), SSA
ministers face increasing termination hazards over time under a given leader. Only after a
speci…c number of years in government do the termination hazard drops.
We then provide a theoretical framework able to reconcile these stylized facts parsimoniously. Section 3 focuses on the problem of a leader selecting and terminating government
insiders based on the time his subordinates have spent in the ‘palace’. Statically, we posit

role in prebendalist societies like the ones we study.

that more experienced ministers (i.e. insiders endowed with longer past experience in government and more political capital in general) are able to produce more value for a leader, but
are also more apt at capturing a larger share of that value. Dynamically, time spent inside
the palace increases the capacity for ministers to stage coups. Insiders have the potential of
becoming “rivals [...] developing their own power base” (Bratton and Van De Walle, 1994,
p.463). As a consequence, a leader will tend to terminate ministers if they become too much
of threat to him2 and this increasingly more over time, as they learn their way through the
government organization. Speci…cally, in our model the leader keeps a check on the capacity
of ministers to stage coups and on their incentives to remain loyal versus attempting coups.
We show that these features naturally deliver non-monotonic hazard functions for ministerial
termination risk. First, coup capacity accumulates and the leader progressively sheds potential rivals. Then, the model displays endogenous ‘safe dates’, points in time after which,
even when given the opportunity of staging a coup, a minister will not take it and remain
loyal. The intuition for why this may happen is simple. Consider for instance that staging a
coup against a consolidated leader means trading o¤ a relatively safe spot as minister versus
the opportunity of running a brand new and fragile regime as leader.
Our theoretical setup naturally delivers a competing-risks model with parametric hazard
functions that can be brought structurally to the data; an exercise we perform in Sections 4
and 5. The structural estimation of the model delivers estimates of the parameters pertaining
to the minister-leader bilateral bargaining problem and the shape of the coup success/coup
capacity function. In Section 6 we also contrast our model with relevant alternatives, showing
how our approach dominates competing theoretical mechanisms. In Section 7 we explore
counterfactual exercises and welfare implications.
By explicitly linking the survival risks of dictators to those of their ministers, we are able
to provide a uni…ed theory of termination risks under autocracy. The implications are of
2

In the words of Soest (2007 p.8) African leaders uproot ministers from their current posts “in order to
prevent any potential opponent from developing his or her own power base”. Indeed, the literature has often
ascribed the “ministerial game of musical chairs” (Tordo¤ and Molteno 1974 p. 254) to this goal.

consequence outside the strict con…nes of cabinet dynamics studied here. For example, the
robust evidence of increasing hazard risks of termination for top politicians within African
regimes strongly indicates how pressing leader’s survival concerns are. By a¤ecting the time
horizons of politicians in power it is easy to see why myopic predation could be pervasive
in SSA polities, possibly trickling down the whole clientelistic chain from ministerial posts
to the bureaucracy, curtailing valued political investment and ultimately a¤ecting economic
performance.3 In addition, since these survival concerns vary across regimes and lessen over
time within the same regime, we provide a novel explanation for the massive variation in
performance observed across autocracies (see Besley and Kudamatsu, 2008).
This paper speaks to a vast literature on the political economy of development (Bates,
1981) and on the internal organization of weakly institutionalized countries (Tullock, 1987;
Wintrobe, 1998; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2005; Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, Siverson, and
Morrow, 2003). In particular with respect to Africa, at least since Jackson and Rosberg
(1982), the literature has evolved around the study of individual incentives of elites/clients
within the complex structure of personal relationships at the basis of neopatrimonial societies.
This paper is most closely related to previous work on the internal organization of autocracies (Geddes, 2003; Gandhi and Przeworski, 2006; Haber, 2006; Besley and Kudamatsu,
2008; Arriola, 2009; Francois, Rainer, and Trebbi, 2014; Bidner, Francois and Trebbi, 2014)
and from a theoretical standpoint to recent research on incentives of dictators in selecting
insiders (Egorov and Sonin, 2011).
Finally, this work also speaks to the large political science literature on cabinet duration4
and ministerial survival5 . Relative to this literature, we depart in terms of focus, by targeting weakly institutionalized countries, and methodology by addressing the speci…c time

See Dal Bo’and Rossi (2011) for systematic evidence in Argentina.
King et al (1990), Kam and Indridason (2005). Particularly, see Diermeier and Stevenson (1999) for a
competing risk model of cabinet duration.

The political science literature typically does not consider individual ministers as the relevant unit of
observation, focusing instead on the entire cabinet. Alt (1975) and Berlinski et al. (2007) are exceptions
centered on British cabinet members, while Huber and Gallardo (2008) focus on nineteen parliamentary
democracies. To the best of our knowledge this is the …rst systematic study of this type focused on autocratic
regimes.

Leadership and Ministerial Survival in Africa
This section presents nonparametrically a set of stylized facts characterizing the process

of selection and termination of national ministers in Africa. We will use this set of empirical
regularities to guide the discussion in the following sections, but also to report our new
evidence unburdened by any theoretical structure.
We recorded the names and positions of every government member that appears in the
annual publications of Africa South of the Sahara or The Europa World Year Book between
1960 and 2004 and employ data on each national ministerial post since independence on
Benin, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea,
Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Kenya, and Uganda.
These …fteen countries jointly comprise a population of 492 million, or 45 percent of the
whole continent’s population. The details on the ministerial data, as well as a thorough
discussion of the evidence in support of the relevance of national governments in African
politics, can be found in Rainer and Trebbi (2011). Summary statistics of the sample by
country can be found in Table 1. Table 2 reports spell-speci…c information for all ministers
in the sample.
In Figure 1 we show our …rst empirical regularity. Leaders with more experience in
government at the onset of their regimes tend to systematically hire ministers with more
experience in government (both measures are proxied by the number of years recorded in
previous cabinets). The …gure reports both the linear …t and a nonparametric lowess …t,
both underscoring a positive and signi…cant statistical relationship between ministerial past
political experience and leader’s experience at regime onset (the regression coe¢ cient is 0:79
with a robust standard error clustered at the country level of 0:01). In Figure 2 we split

4

senior and junior government posts. We de…ne as senior posts the Presidency/Premiership,
Defense, Budget, Commerce, Finance, Treasury, Economy, Agriculture, Justice, Foreign
A¤airs. Leaders select more experienced ministers for more senior posts and they appear to
do more so as their experience grows.
We now proceed to illustrating termination risks of both leaders and ministers. One
important …nding that will underlie all our subsequent analysis is that in both groups hazard
rates exhibit distinctive time dependence patterns, but of completely di¤erent nature across
the two.
Let us begin by considering the termination risk of leaders, as this issue has already received some investigation in past literature (see Bienen and Van De Walle, 1989). In Figure
3 we report nonparametric hazard estimates for the pooled sample of post independence
African leaders, for ease of comparison with Bienen and Van De Walle’s analysis, while in
Figure 4 we report nonparametric hazard estimates for the …fteen countries in our sample.
Although Figure 4 is naturally more noisy, both hazard functions clearly exhibit sharp negative time dependence. The termination risk starts around 17% during the …rst year in o¢ ce
for the leader, gradually reaching about half that likelihood of termination conditional on
reaching 10 years in o¢ ce. These …gures are remarkably similar to those reported in Bienen
and Van De Walle’s analysis, but now we extend the sample to the full post-Cold War period.
Our novel results on the nonparametric hazard functions for the risk of termination of a
minister under the same leader are reported in the four panels of Figure 5, which present the
minister’s empirical conditional probabilities of being terminated over time, i.e. their hazard
functions. Let us also note that Figure 5 is conditional on the minister not being terminated
because of the leader’s termination (this is a competing risk we will model explicitly below).
Notice also that we perform the hazard analysis country by country, in order to reduce the
bias due to unobserved heterogeneity, which is particularly damning in duration models, to
a minimum.6
6

Indeed, it is a known issue in duration analysis that pure statistical heterogeneity across hazard functions
implies, when naively aggregated, a hazard function for the mixture distribution that is necessarily declining

5

The patterns are striking. For the vast majority of countries in our sample, ministers face
increasing termination hazards over time under the same leader. In a subset of countries,
after a speci…c number of years in government, hazard rates eventually drop, leading to a
characteristic ‘hump’shape. Typically, between the …rst and …fth year in o¢ ce a minister
sees his likelihood of dismissal increasing by about 50%.7 To the best of our knowledge this
fact is new and proves to be a remarkable departure from estimated termination risks not
just of national leaders – as shown in Figure 4 – but relative to almost any other form of
employment (Farber, 1994).
Finally, due to the sparse nature of the spell observations by country when splitting senior
and junior ministerial spells, we refrain here from presenting separate hazard functions for
both classes of ministerial posts. However, below we will show that senior ministers face
steeper increasing hazards of termination and for them hazard risks drop sooner in analysis
time.

Model
We describe the problem of a leader who has to choose the personnel that will …ll executive

positions (ministries) in his inner circle. Calendar time t = 0; 1; ::: is in…nite and discrete and
leaders choose the cabinet at the start of every period. All individuals discount the future
due to their own mortality risk, the details of which we specify below.

3.1

Ministry Output and Division

Each time a government insider, also referred to as a minister, is replaced in his post,
the leader incurs a cost, denoted " > 0, which we allow to be arbitrarily small. Let ki (t)
in analysis time; see Farber (1994) for a complete discussion.
7
Note also the di¤erent levels of the baseline hazard rates for the di¤erent countries, strongly supporting
our approach of addressing country heterogenity in the most conservative way possible. Alternative corrections would require the use of parameterizations for the frailty in the data. We do not follow this approach
here.

be the political capital of minister i at time t. Political capital is accumulated through
political experience, growing at constant rate g with time in o¢ ce, and is useful in generating
ministerial output. Speci…cally, if i is a minister in period t in a ministry m his output is
(ki (t))

m

. Assume there are two types of ministries: m = J denotes a junior ministry and

m = S a senior one, with

S

>

J.

Assume that there is an elastic supply of ministers for

each and every level of experience.
Denote the leader by l and assume that the leader installed at time tl has capital level
kl (t) = (1 + g)t

tl

kl0 ; i.e., the leader’s growth rate is also g while in o¢ ce and kl0 is the

leader’s political capital at entry. A leader l placing individual i in ministry post of type
m has the potential to hold up production in i0 s ministry. Intuitively, from time-to-time
the minister in charge of a post requires an essential input, which the leader controls and
can withhold at will. Formally, we allow this to be governed by a stochastic process: with
probability H the leader can hold-up any single ministry, m in any period t. This random
variable is i.i.d. across ministries and is drawn each period, separately for each ministry.
We assume that the hold up problem, when it arises, is solved by Nash Bargaining between
the leader and minister over the ministry’s output. Let the leader’s bargaining power (in the
Nash Bargaining sense) be denoted

m,

with 1

m

denoting the minister’s. Suppressing

time notation, this leads to the following division of ministerial surplus generated in a period
where hold up in ministry m occurs (where w denotes the amount of the ministry’s value
paid to the minister):

.

The threat points for each player are zero output in the ministry – either the minister
contributes no e¤ort, and/or the leader withholds the essential input.
The relative bargaining power,

m,

is assumed to be determined according to the relative

capital level of the leader l and his chosen minister, i, according to:

chosen minister.

3.2

Coup Threats: Means, Motive, and Opportunity.

Endogenous coups d’état come from government insiders seeking to become leaders. Realistically we assume coups are extremely costly to the leader. Speci…cally, we assume that
falling victim to a coup leads to a large negative shock to leader utility (e.g. death). As will
be shown, any non-negligible cost to coups and non-negligible probability of coup success
will lead to the outcomes we characterize, so we proceed as seems realistic by leaving the
cost of losing a coup as large, without pinning it down further.9
Three factors determine whether a minister will decide to mount a coup: i) having the
means to stage it; ii) having the incentives to stage it (i.e. the “motive” in undertaking
a sanctionable action); and iii) having the actual opportunity of following through. In our
model the leader will monitor means and motive, and, when necessary, preclude opportunity.
3.2.1

Means

In order to mount a coup, a government insider must establish su¢ cient connections
within the government to coordinate the coup action. This plotting capacity is a function
of the length of tenure an individual has had within the government and depends positively
on the importance of the individual’s position. Speci…cally, individuals grow their own coup
capacity by the amount m(t)ci (t) each period t of their current stint in o¢ ce, where ci (t) is
an i.i.d. draw from a stationary distribution C with non-negative support. In our estimation
we will assume C to be Exponential (& c ) with scale & c ; a convenient form as it has positive
support, only one parameter, and its n fold convolution is closed-form. We assume that
m(t) = 1 if m = J at time t and m(t) = MS > 1 if m = S, implying that the plotting
obvious below.
9
Because the costs of turnover are small, and because leaders have full information about coup capacity.

8

capacity of a minister grows proportionately more with time spent in senior posts (central
and important positions, like Defense or Treasury) as opposed to junior ones (peripheral
ones, like Sports). Assume that coup capacity is regime-speci…c (unlike k, which persists
across regimes). Thus, at calendar time t minister i who …rst entered into the government
P
at time t0i < t has accumulated coup capacity t =t0 m ( ) ci ( ), where the aggregation is
i

over the duration of the spell in government in a post of type m. Coup capacity is common

knowledge, and gives a minister the capacity to mount a coup if and only if it reaches a
P
c: Since c (t) are
critical threshold, denoted c; that is, if and only if t =t0 m ( ) ci ( )
i
P
independent draws from an exponential with scale & c , then t =1 c ( )
Gamma (t; & c ),
where t is the Gamma’s shape and & c its scale. Since & c is not separately identi…able from c,
we will normalize c = 1.
Exogenous Threats
Leaders can be terminated for exogenous reasons other than coups. We assume a base
leadership hazard (1

) that applies per period of leadership ad in…nitum. This proxies

for mortality/health threats of standard physiological nature. We similarly assume a base
leadership hazard for ministers for reasons like ill health, retirement from politics, etc.: a
1

probability event.
Additionally, the data shows a high potential for external threats to leaders early on in a

regime (for an early contribution, see Bienen and Van De Walle, 1989). Upon inception, new
regimes are extremely fragile, with a high probability of termination due to exogenous factors
like foreign military interventions, sensitivity to shifts in international alliances, or simply
lack of consolidation of the leaders’power base. We model these external threats in a reducedform way, positing that this exogenous fragility declines through time as a sequence of regime
age speci…c continuation probabilities

Timing

Timing is reported in Figure 6. Each existing minister comes in to period t with his
P
personal coup capacity, t =t0 m ( ) ci ( ) for minister i; where period t0 s draw was at the
i

end of period t

1: The leader observes each minister’s capacity and decides whether he will

continue in his portfolio, or whether to replace him with a new minister who necessarily will
have zero coup capacity. Hold-up opportunities are then realized, and in ministries where
these occur, the minister and leader bargain over the division of ministerial surplus. Production occurs and consumption shares are allocated according to the Nash Bargain. Exogenous
termination draws for both ministers and leader then occur. Exogenous terminations for the
leader imply dissolution of the cabinet, and a new leader, randomly drawn from the set of
all individuals, to start next period (at which point he selects a new cabinet). Exogenous
terminations for a minister leave a ministry vacancy to be …lled at the start of the next
period by the existing leader. Surviving ministers with su¢ cient coup capacity then decide
whether to mount a coup or not. If so, and successful, the coup leader will start as leader
in the next period (multiple coups are allowed, and if more than one succeeds, a leader is
drawn from the successors randomly). If the coup fails or none is attempted, the leader stays
in place. Failed coup plotters are removed and excluded from all future ministerial rents.
At the end of the period, the increment to each minister’s coup capacity is drawn from
distribution C: Surviving ministers carry their coup capacity to the start of t + 1 after which
the sequence repeats.
3.2.3

Motive and Opportunity

The Value of Being Leader
Let V l (ki (t) ; t), denote the net present monetary value that an individual of experience ki (t) has to becoming the leader at calendar time t. This monetary value is the
aggregation of the leader’s share of ministerial rents captured through hold up and the
ensuing bilateral bargaining over ministerial spoils in each ministry through time. Let
10

V l (ki (t) ; t) =

P

m=J;S

Nm Vml (ki (t) ; t), where Vml (ki (t) ; t) denotes the corresponding net

present monetary value for ministry m, and the total number of ministries is given by the
sum over junior and senior posts10 , N = NJ + Ns . Since an unsuccessful coup leads to
the protagonist’s dismissal from government (and rents) forever, the net present value for
a minister with capital ki (t) staging a coup at t that succeeds with probability

2 [0; 1]

equals V l (ki (t) ; t).
The Value of being a Minister
Let V m (ki (t) ; tl ) denote the net present value of being a minister in ministry m, with
capital ki (t) operating within a regime whose leader l took o¢ ce at tl . The value of being a
minister depends on the ‡ow value created by an individual’s time in the ministry, the share
of that ‡ow value he appropriates, and the minister’s estimates of his likelihood of continuing
in o¢ ce. Three di¤erent hazard risks a¤ect this continuation probability each period. The
…rst risk arises from something exogenous happening to the minister; the 1

exogenous

shocks described above. A second risk arises from the conscious decisions of the leader to
terminate a minister’s appointment. If the leader decides i has become an insupportable risk,
then minister i must go. This removes “opportunity”for the minister, which we assume can
no longer stage a palace coup when ousted. The third threat to continuation for a minister
arises from the leader being actually hit by his own exogenous shock, in case of which the
whole cabinet is terminated.11 In essence this means that the (1

(t)) and (1

) risks

also enter into the hazard function of a minister.
Ministerial coup incentives
It follows that a minister with capital ki (t), in a regime where the leader came to power
in period tl has no incentive to mount a coup against the leader in period t if and only if:

(2)

V l (ki (t) ; t)

V m (ki (t) ; tl ) .

10
We do not model the size of the cabinet endogenously. See Arriola (2009) for a discussion of how the
cabinet size may be related to clientelistic motives.
11
We could, more correctly, allow for this discount to be less than 1
for a minister, since some ministers
remain in cabinet when leaders are exogenously removed. For now, assume full turnover.

Analysis

3.3.1

Optimal ministerial experience.

The Nash bargain in (1) yields w = (1
m ki

m ) ki

m

, so that the leader’s share of output is

. Given this, leader l chooses ki at any time t to maximize the value he obtains from

…lling the ministry in the event that he has a hold up opportunity.12 Speci…cally, leader with
kl solves:
max
ki

kl
k m ,
kl + ki i

where again we suppress time notation for simplicity. We denote the solution of the …rst
order condition for ministry m by:

m

kim (kl ) =

(3)

1

kl .
m

The optimal solution for ministerial capital in post m also determines

m

=

kl
kl +

m

1

m

kl

=1

m:

m.

Thus the bargaining power that ensues re‡ects the endogenous e¤ect of the ministry’s primitive

m

on bargaining shares through the leader’s optimal choice of ministerial experience.

Note that the optimal solution as a ratio of leader’s seniority is invariant to the leader’s experience and therefore stationary in calendar time:

kim (kl (t))
kl (t)

=

m

1

m

for all t. We summarize:

Proposition 1. 1. Leaders pick identically experienced ministers for cabinet posts of the
same seniority level:
2. Leaders select ministers with more experience for senior posts.
3. Leaders with more experience pick cabinets with more experience.
4. The leader’s experience and that of his optimal minister in any post grow proportionately.
12

When he cannot hold up the ministry, his ministerial choice is payo¤ irrelevant.

12

The model thus presents no reason to turn over ministers in terms of productivity gains,
since ministerial and leadership experience grow at the same rate. We now study what shapes
ministerial incentives to stage palace coups and how the incentive compatibility constraint
they face can render them a threat, and thus result in endogenous turnover.

the equilibrium path, a feature we will demonstrate subsequently. Using (3), the fact that

We have already established from (2) that the incentives for a minister to mount a coup
at any time, t, depend on a comparison between the value to the minister of becoming
leader, weighted by coup success probability, V l (kl (t) ; tl ), and the value of remaining a
minister V m (ki (t) ; tl ) at that time. The dynamics of coup incentives (together with coup
capacity) determine the shape of a minister’s hazard function through time, since leaders
will terminate ministers with both capacity and incentives to mount coups. The ministerial
hazard through time is critically a¤ected by the relationship between the shapes of these
two value functions along a minister’s tenure. However, since V m (ki (t) ; tl ) depends on the
endogenous decisions of the leader to dismiss the minister at all points in future, it is not
possible to simply characterize the relationship between these two value functions.
We thus proceed as follows. Denote by Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) the net present value of being a

minister in ministry m, with capital ki (t) operating within a regime whose leader l took
o¢ ce at tl , under the assumption that l will never ‘endogenously’remove i from o¢ ce, nor
move i to a di¤erent ministry m0 6= m. Intuitively, this value is (weakly) higher than the
true net present value of being a minister at t, V m (ki (t) ; tl ), as it removes from the true set
of hazards the possibility of a leader deciding to remove i from o¢ ce endogenously. It turns
out to be easier to work with this simpler object Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) ; and we will do so in what

14

follows. It can be expressed as:

Though simpler, it is still not possible to directly characterize the evolution of these value
functions. The following result simpli…es the problem considerably.
Lemma 1. If Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) < V l (ki (t) ; t) at t, then minister i will mount a coup against

leader l in any period

t when he has the capacity to do so.

All Proofs are in the Appendix.
Intuitively, the lemma tells the leader that a minister with incentive to mount a coup at
some future date will also have incentive to mount a coup today, if he has the capacity to
do so. This form of ‘unraveling’is intuitive. Since coup capacity does not decay, the leader
knows that eventually such a minister will have incentive to act on his current coup capacity.
But if he would do so eventually, he will be dismissed by the leader for certain just before
reaching that speci…c date. Anticipating this dismissal, the minister will act pro-actively
and attempt a coup before that date. Then, the leader, knowing this, will dismiss him …rst,
and so on, up until the …rst date at which a coup capacity ensues.
3.3.3

Optimal Ministerial Turnover

Notice that the reasoning above does not depend on the relationship between the quasi
value function Ve m (ki ( ) ; tl ) and value function V l (ki ( ) ; ) at any points

< t, so the

di¢ cult problem of characterizing the evolution of these functions through a minister’s tenure
can be avoided. This allows us to characterize optimal ministerial turnover in terms of a
single “safe” date for minister i with respect to leader l in ministry m, which we denote
15

Ti = T (m; ki (t) ; tl ). De…ne Ti as the date at and after which minister i will NOT mount
a coup against leader l, and before which minister i will, if he has coup capacity. We now
show the existence of such a safe date, and how it is determined by comparing these value
functions at a single point.
Lemma 2. Consider the quasi value function for a loyal minister Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ), the value
of challenging V l (ki (t) ; t), and the set of crossing points in these functions, de…ned over

the complete possible tenure of minister m. Denote this set
ments of t such that Ve m (ki (t

1) ; tl ) < ( ) V l (ki (t

1) ; t

V l (ki (t) ; t).

If

.

includes all the ele-

1) and Ve m (ki (t) ; tl )

(<)

= ;; then:

1. If and only if Ve m (ki (t0 ) ; tl )

V l (ki (t0 ) ; t0 ): Ti = t0 ,

2. otherwise Ti does not exist.

If

6= ;; then:

1. If and only if at t

sup

: Ve m (ki (t) ; tl )

V l (ki (t) ; t) then Ti = sup ,

2. otherwise Ti does not exist.

The Lemma provides a simple means by which to calculate a minister’s safe date. It
requires considering the crossing of the quasi value function of a loyal minister Ve m (ki (t) ; tl )

with that of a coup challenge V l (ki (t) ; t) only at the last date where these intersect.13 If
beyond that date a minister with capacity wants to undertake coups, then by Lemma 1, the
minister will undertake coups whenever he has the capacity, and a safe date does not exist.
If beyond that date the minister does not want to undertake coups, then he will not do so
once the date is reached, but will strictly wish to do so before hand, again due to Lemma 1,
thus de…ning the safe date. If the two value functions never intersect, then the minister is
either always safe or never safe, depending on which value function is greater according to
13

Note that the de…nition of excludes a situation where the highest intersection point is where the value
functions are equal for more than one period. This is a point of measure zero in the model’s parameter
space. Including this possibility changes no results. It does require introducing more cumbersome notation
so we proceed by ignoring it. Details are available from the authors upon request.

16

condition (2).
Leaders incur costs " ! 0 when replacing a minister. Therefore if a minister does not
present a coup threat to the leader, and presuming that he was chosen optimally in the
previous period, the leader strictly prefers to keep him in the next period. We have already
seen that in order to determine whether the minister is a coup threat, at any time t the
leader monitors both the minister i’s means and incentives via the safe date. This allows
for a simple characterization of ministerial turnover. The following describes how the leader
determines ministerial turnover.
Proposition 2. Consider minister i in post m at time t under a leader of vintage tl . If

(6)

t

m ( ) ci ( )

c.

does NOT hold, then minister i is reappointed for another period.
If (6) holds, then leader l dismisses m if and only if t < Ti = T (m; ki (t) ; tl ).
The proposition outlines the two-step decision process a leader makes for each minister’s renewal. Each period the leader computes coup capacity (6) and the safe date
Ti = T (m; ki (t) ; tl ) for all N ministers. He replaces a minister if and only if (6) holds
and they are not at their safe date. Otherwise, the minister continues another period.

Hazard Functions, Likelihood and Identi…cation
The model allows us to now specify the equilibrium survival and hazard functions. Given

our interest in the shape of the time dependence of the endogenous termination risk for
ministers, rather than on the role of speci…c covariates per se, our approach is drastically
di¤erent to commonly employed proportional hazard models, such as the Cox model. In
addition, our survival model tackles head on the heterogeneity across leaders and ministers
of di¤erent vintages under the same leader in a way that is extremely general, as will become
17

clear below.
In terms of notation we have so far focused on calendar time t. Let us now introduce useful
notation for analysis time (i.e. time since minister i takes o¢ ce at t0i ) and use the symbol 0 to
distinguish analysis time from calendar time, or t0i = t (t0i

1). Stripping away unnecessary

indexes, we start by de…ning the unconditional probability of an insider’s termination t0
periods after his appointment, f (t0 ). Notice that f : N+ ! [0; 1] is a discrete density
function de…ned over years in o¢ ce (the sample frequency available to us) and indicate with
F (t0 ) its corresponding cumulative function, thus de…ning the minister’s survival function
S(t0 ) = 1

F (t0 ).

The model postulates the presence of three competing and statistically independent terPt0
mination risks for a minister: i) the minister’s endogenous dismissal likelihood Pr
=1 m ( ) c ( ) > c

before T 0 = max T
hood 1

(t0

1) ; 1 periods ; ii) the minister’s idiosyncratic dismissal likeli-

; and iii) termination due to the leader’s demise (due to 1

or 1

(t

tl )). The

data enable us to distinguish whether the minister is terminated under the same leader (and
hence must have been victim of an endogenous termination or of a 1

shock), indexed by

r = 1, or whether the minister is terminated because the leader changed (and hence due to
either a shock 1

or 1

(t

tl )) indexed by r = 214 . In a competing risk model it is

useful to distinguish the overall hazard for a minister,
from the risk-speci…c hazards

r

(t0 ; tl ; m) = f (t0 ; tl ; m)=S(t0 ; tl ; m),

(t0 ; tl ; m) for risks r = 1; 2.

It follows that the survival and hazard functions are:
Proposition 3. The survival function probability of minister i to t0i in post m under a leader
14

For simplicity we exclude co-occurrence of health shock of the minister and leader’s exogenous termination (health shocks or otherwise). We are not able to separate endogenous terminations of ministers on the
part of leaders from sudden death or incapacitation (1
), because of lack of data on natural incapacitations for our ministers. We could separate terminations of ministers due to sudden death or incapacitation
of the leader (1
) from those due to exogenous threats to the leadership (1
(t tl )) because data on
natural incapacitations/deaths for all leaders are available, but we chose not to. The literature has already
established good benchmarks for and we can simplify the estimation by calibrating this (not particularly
interesting) parameter.

5. For any minister

The …rst feature of

1

tl + t .

is that for t0 < T 0 the hazard is strictly increasing, as the probability

of remaining below the minimal coup capacity decreases over time. This is a common feature
of cumulative shock models to which this setup is theoretically close. The second feature is
20

that once an insider passes the threshold time T 0 , the hazard function drops discontinuously,
as the minister’s endogenous dismissal likelihood goes to zero, and the hazard rate for r = 1
becomes constant. If i is in a senior ministry the drop will come sooner, but the hazards
will drop from a higher level, speci…cally by a shift factor MS > 1 if m = S until the time
of the drop. In comparative terms, the hazard function will be higher at the start for senior
ministers, then lower after the senior ministers become safe but the juniors have still not
reached safety, and then both will eventually plateau to 1

beyond each critical point.

In addition, the critical T 0 < +1 at which the hazard rate drops comes later for younger
leaders for given calendar time t. The hazard function

2

is monotonically decreasing in

analysis time before calendar time tl + t is reached, at which point it becomes constant at
1

.
Parametric Speci…cations
A set of parametric restrictions are required before specifying the likelihood function.

First, a process for the leader’s fragility to external threats (t

with

> 0. We

= 0:95, g = 0:05, and H = 1, as H cannot be separately identi…ed from

(and with the understanding that the estimated

will be de‡ated by the holdup risk).

The baseline exogenous ministerial shock is set at

= 0:9015 . Further, and in order to

maximize data availability for the estimation of the model’s parameters we impose complete
symmetry among junior and senior posts, MS = 1 and

m

=

for m = J; S. Hence the

parameter identi…es a single safe date T (m; ki (t) ; tl ) m = J; S common to all ministers
under leader l and we can show that in this case no information about the exact value of the
political capital levels kl or ki is necessary to evaluate the incentive compatibility constraints
of ministers that determines T .

to risk r, de…ne the dummy di = 1 if i is not right censored16 and 0 otherwise, and the dummy
ri = 1 if i is terminated by risk 1 and 0 otherwise. De…ne the set of structural parameters of
the desire and capacity functions

= ( ; t ; ; ; & c ). While parameters ( ; t ; ) are going

to be assumed constant across countries and leaders, we are going to allow the parameter & c
to di¤er across countries (allowing the accumulation of coup capacity to vary at the national
level and indicating it in bold as vector) and the parameter

to vary at the country-leader

level (allowing the coup success likelihood to vary from regime to regime).
Likelihood Function
De…ne for a minister i given experience at entry of his leader kl0 and vintage tl the vector

Identi…cation
The apparently simple formulation (7) is deceptive. First, much of the identi…cation
here relies on the unobserved safe dates Ti0 which impose stark discontinuities to the hazard
functions. Second, hazard functions are heterogenous across ministers of di¤erent vintages.
16

Left censoring is not possible within our sample, as all countries are considered from the start of their
postcolonial history.
17
With a slight abuse of notation we indicate with i both the minister and ministerial spells. Typically
ministers present only one spell, but certainly not always. The implication in the loglikelihood (7) is that
we consider here separate spells of the same minister as di¤erent observations with respect to the draws of
and the initial level of the coup network stock. However, we do maintain memory of the experience of the
minister through the initial political capital stock ki0 , which also in‡uences the coup incentives and is higher
at every subsequent spell of the same individual.

22

Consider a leader with a safe date six periods from being installed. A minister installed at
the same time as the leader faces a di¤erent hazard function than a minister installed …ve
periods into the leader’s tenure, as he is …ve periods closer to the safe date and faces only
one period of endogenous risk (relative to six).
We can however take advantage of the useful separability of our problem. We do not
observe the amount of political capital of each minister ki (t), but we have handy observational proxies of political capital for ministers and leaders. De…ne the observed cumulated
experience in government (i.e. number of years served in any cabinet capacity) at calendar
time t by minister i, k~i (t) and likewise for the leader l, k~l (t). We can realistically posit that
years of experience are a noisy, but unbiased, proxy of political capital:
kl (t) = k~l (t) + "lt
kim (kl (t)) = k~i (t) + "it

where " is a mean zero error uncorrelated across individuals. Recall that at any date t the
model implies ki (kl (t)) =kl (t) = = (1

) as a steady relationship between ministerial and

leader’s political capital18 . By rearranging and pooling across all leaders/countries in our
sample l and all i at tl it is therefore possible to estimate:

(8)

k~i (tl ) =

1

k~l (tl ) + 'ltl + "itl

18

Although apparently restrictive, the result of constant capital across ministries of type m is a necessary
condition for dealing parsimoniously with the lack of clear proxies of political capital of government insiders. Such a metric would be arduous to de…ne for democratic regimes, where political data is much more
transparent and readily available than in Africa, but it is even more so in this context. Clearly the observed
cumulated experience in government of any politician is only one partial dimension of his/her political capital. Focusing only on previous years in government as a measure of political experience of a minister could
underestimate the e¤ective level of political capital. For instance, experience as a party cadre or within particular pre-colonial ethnic institutions (i.e. the role of paramount chiefs in Sierra Leone) are hard to measure,
but surely a factor in determining the amount of political capital of leaders and insiders. Our approach is to
leverage on multiple observations of career ministers over time in order to pin down the patterns of average
political experience within the dictator’s inner circle. This obviously sacri…ces some heterogeneity across
ministers along the ki (t) dimension, but it is the consequence of paucity of accurate proxies for ki (t). Part
of this heterogeneity is however recovered in estimation by allowing for country-speci…c parameters.

23

where 'ltl =

1

"ltl is a leader-speci…c …xed e¤ect. The auxiliary regression (8) is particularly

useful as it directly delivers estimates for ^ independently of the other parameters of the
model.
Further, the parameters (t ; ) governing the hazard

2

can also be directly recovered

by …tting a parametric hazard model to the leaders’termination data alone (the same data
used in Figure 1 and 2 to be precise).
Given the common parameters ( ; t ; ), the vectors of coup success and coup capacity
parameters ( ; & c ) governing the hazard

1

are estimated postulating a safe date for each

leader and iterating until a global maximum of the likelihood function is obtained

5

19

.

Estimation
Table 3a reports the maximum likelihood estimates for all countries. One …rst important

parameter that is estimated through the ministerial data is the technological parameter ,
which also identi…es the bargaining power of the leader relative to his cabinet insiders. We
impose a common

for all countries. Diminishing returns to ministerial political capital

appear to kick in very early in the data, as the estimated

= 0:055 imposes a substantial

degree of curvature in the production function. This implies a relative insensitivity of the
political production process to the experience of the minister. Consequently, in our sample
the bargaining power of the minister appears low. The bargaining power of the leader can
be computed as

= 0:945 relative to ministers.

The country-speci…c coup capacity parameter & c and leader-speci…c coup success probability

are essential in determining whether a country exhibits a safe date or not. The

absence of a safe date implies the hazard of ministers to be monotonically increasing, as per
Proposition 5. If a leader exhibits a safe date, the hazard is non monotonic.
The estimates for & c are indicative of the speed at which the coup capacity threshold
19

Given the parsimony of our model, the likelihood function depends on a relatively small number of
parameters. This allows for a fairly extensive search for global optima over the parametric space. In
particular, we employ a genetic algorithm optimizer.

24

(6) is met by a government insider. this parameter governs the steepness of the hazard
function. Speci…cally, & c identi…es the scale of the exponential shocks to the capacity of
staging coups, or the speed at which ministers might be building a “power base” (Soest,
2007). The higher & c the faster coup capacity accumulates and the faster the leader is bound
to …re his ministers. The range of & c is varied. For example, the “musical chairs”of Mobutu
Sese’s Congo generate a high estimate of 0:61, implying extremely high churning. The more
stable Cameroon has a value of 0:36. To see why a scale of 0:61 would imply a high value of
churning one has to compute the expected time at which a threshold of 1 is reached20 by the
convolution of the coup capacity c shocks. Since the scale of an exponential located at 0 is
its expected value, then in Congo there’s an accumulation of 0:61 per period, or equivalently
the threshold for coup capacity may be reached in less than 2 years on average. Instead, for
& c = :36 the threshold is reached in about 3 years, and so on. Obviously these …gures imply
sharply decreasing survival functions, as discussed below.
The vector

is the most complex part of the parameter space to pin down due to the

sharp discontinuity presented by (1). We are however able to identify the parameters in
Montecarlo simulations. Given the discreteness of the safe date (measured in years), there is
an interval of coup success probabilities satisfying the condition in Lemma 1 and each

can

only be set identi…ed. In part b of Table 3 we report the lower and upper bound on interval
of the

parameters for each leader, ordered over time and by country. In case ministers

under a leader are never safe (i.e. they always have an incentive to stage coups), the interval
includes the extreme 1 (i.e. coups succeeding surely cannot be ruled out). As an example
for how to read Table 3b, Ahmadou Ahidjo corresponds to the …rst leader of Cameroon and
has a

in a tight neighborhood of 0:10 percent, while Paul Biya, Cameroon’s second leader,

has a

in a tight neighborhood of 0:13 percent, and so on.

The parameter

ranges from 0:1 to 0:25 percent typically. This does not obviously imply

implausibly unlikely coup successes, as one has to remember that this …gure has to be scaled
20

1 is in fact our normalized value for the coup capacity threat level c.

25

by H. Speci…cally, the reported bounds on the elements of

are obtained as the likelihood

of success of a coup against that leader multiplied by the holdup probability H. Given that
each

and H are both unobservable and related to the (also unobservable) safe date T , it

is hard to pin down the exact strength of the coup threat quantitatively. What is reassuring
is that the estimates appear larger in countries with more troubled histories of coups and
plotting like Congo and Nigeria, than in countries with relatively more stable autocratic
governments, like Gabon and Cameroon.
Table 3a also reports the leader’s hazard parameters. We impose a common vector (t ; )
for all countries, given the typical paucity of leaders per country which would make an
estimation by country impossible. Leaders reach a point of constant low hazard

after

t = 15 years in o¢ ce and along the way we observe a smooth drop in regime fragility
( = 0:0567). Both are very tightly estimated parameters.
Concerning the …t, the model is able to capture the non-monotonic nature of the termination hazard functions in countries with safe dates, while accommodating monotonically
increasing hazard functions in the remaining countries which do not exhibit safe dates. In
Appendix Figure A1 we report the model …t for all countries as well as the nonparametric
hazard …t. The model also o¤ers remarkably good …t of the survival functions of the ministers also reported for each country separately in Appendix Figure A2. Survival functions
are obviously very important to the estimation of the overall duration of each minister, as
evident from our likelihood function, so it is reassuring the …t is tight along this dimension
as well.
An important check we perform on our model is what would happen if we were to employ
exclusively ministers in top positions for estimation. In Appendix Tables A1a and A1b we
report the maximum likelihood estimates restricting the sample to the senior ministers only.
Given that senior ministers are the most plausible source of replacement risk for the leader,
one may want to make sure that the estimated parameters do not vary wildly relative to
the baseline and the …t remains reasonable. In fact, were the estimates extremely unstable

26

relative to the baseline, this might be a source of concern, given the focus on a subset of the
data where coup concerns should be more salient. Tables A1a,b are reassuring in this sense,
as the implications of Table 3a,b are largely con…rmed, with one model’s points estimates
typically within con…dence bands of the other speci…cation.

Alternative Duration Models
This section discusses in more detail a set of relevant alternatives relative to our main

model. The goal is to provide support for our modeling choices by rejecting competing
theoretical mechanisms that do not match the data.
Consider …rst what is, likely, the most intuitive of all alternatives: leaders are tantamount to employers hiring workers (their ministers) and try to select the best ones, laying
o¤ the rest. This is essentially a pure selection mechanism of ministerial personnel based
on learning workers’ type/match quality on the part of the leader. Without providing an
exact microfoundation, which would be redundant, the idea of a selection motive a¤ecting
termination risks for ministers would work through a discovery of the minister’s type and
termination of the bad types. Early on in their tenure bad ministers would be screened out
and only talented ministers, which would then likely remain bar some random separation
shock, would remain.
This mechanism intuitively delivers a downward-sloping hazard function in time in of…ce under the same leader for any minister. This is, in fact, amply discussed in the vast
and related labor economics literature concerned with job separations in duration models
of employment (or so called ‘inspection good models’ with no gradual learning about the
employer-employee match, Jovanovich, 1984). Where we can safely reject this alternative
is in that it would fail to predict initially or continually increasing hazard rates, which we
have shown previously to be a robust feature of the data. This very same fact would reject
learning by doing on the part of ministers as an alternative mechanism as well. That is, a

27

setting in which early on in his career a ministers makes a lot of mistakes that could potentially cost him his job, but whose likelihood decreases as he gets more acquainted with his
role over time. Again the predicted equilibrium hazard function would be downward sloping
in analysis time under this alternative scenario (see Nagypal, 2007).
These alternative mechanisms of selection or learning by doing can be accommodated in
our empirical model and formally tested through generalized likelihood ratio tests, such as the
Vuong and the Clarke speci…cation selection tests. To see how this is possible, consider the
Pt0
endogenous dismissal likelihood Pr
=1 m ( ) c ( ) > c . This is essentially the backbone

of a cumulative shock model with resistance threshold c. Now, let us augment the process
of accumulation of shocks by adding n additional shocks g ( ) for the …rst

m periods

in o¢ ce, but adding no additional shocks after m periods. These additional early shocks
essentially load risk of passing the resistance threshold c in the …rst few years for a minister
and can potentially describe an early selection hazard in addition to the coup risk which is
the focus of our model. Moreover, the useful convolution properties that we have emphasized
above can be preserved if one is willing to maintain i.i.d. exponential shocks g. In Table 4
we consider three di¤erent instances of this selection mechanism: n = 1; 2; and 5 additional
shocks g are added in period m = 1 only. This means that the hazard function can now
Pt0
be construed using Pr
=1 m ( ) c ( ) + ng (1) > c , also regulating the intensity of the
selection strength by increasing n. Were the data willing to accommodate additional selection
risk in the …rst year of o¢ ce, as the Jovanovich model would imply for instance, then Vuong
and Clarke tests would support such alternatives relative to the hazard process implied by
our model. As is evident from Table 4, all three alternative models are rejected in favor
of our baseline mechanism with p-values less the 1 percent, indicating that these additional
mechanism play at best a second order role.
Two additional alternatives can be equally addressed. Let us assume, for instance, that
a leader has only partial information about the true political quality (say, valence) of his
ministers, but observes informative signals slowly over time. Under rational learning, the

28

accumulation of information would determine a certain delay in …ring low quality ministers,
due to the likely use of optimal thresholds in posterior beliefs for determining, with a su¢ cient
degree of certainty, a rational selection criterion. This particular setup may deliver a selection
with delay hazard function. As it takes time to assess the (initially unknown) quality of
every minister in order to keep the ‘good’ministers and drop the ‘bad’, initially increasing
hazards could be generated in equilibrium, while an hazard drop later on could be a simple
consequence of the selection dynamics described above.21 Where this mechanism would fail
empirically would be in matching another important feature of the data: the fact that more
experienced leaders tend to systematically hire more experienced ministers and less senior
leaders tend to hire less experienced ministers. In fact, any model simply pivoting around
selection incentives based on discovering the true type of a minister would likely imply a
preference for more experienced ministers by both experienced and unexperienced leaders
alike, for experienced ministers are, in many respects, a better known entity.
Another reasonable interpretation for the process of political appointment in neopatrimonialist systems, like the ones in Africa, is what can be referred to as the “my turn to
eat”hypothesis22 . In the words of van Soest (2007) “neopatrimonial rulers frequently rotate
the political elite [...] in order to extend the clientelist network”, while Snyder (1992) states
that “Mobutu’s patronage network was characterized by such frequent circulation of elites
that Thomas Turner likened Zaire’s politics to a ‘game of musical chairs’. Elite circulation
atomized Zairian elites by pressuring them to focus exclusively on self-aggrandizement during
the short period they had access to state power and perquisites.” Turner and Young (1985),
cited by Acemoglu, Robinson, and Verdier (2004), speci…cally talk with respect to Mobutu
of “Client o¢ ce holders have been constantly reminded of the precariousness of tenure by the
frequency of o¢ ce rotation, which simultaneously fuels the hopes of those Zairians anxiously
21

Non-monotone hazard rates (…rst increasing and eventually decreasing over tenure) are common in
models with job-matching where the quality of the match is unknown at the time of the match formation
and is revealed over time through observing one’s productivity on the job. See Jovanovic (1979, 1984) for
early examples within the labor economics literature.

waiting just outside the portals of power”. More precisely, suppose there is a set of political elites that a country leader has to “feed” with patronage disbursements waiting on the
national cabinet’s sidelines and that ministerial posts precisely serve this purpose, as vastly
documented (Arriola, 2009; Francois, Rainer, and Trebbi, 2014). Essentially, elites are to be
assigned positions, be fed, and eventually let go. This mechanism would arguably predict
initially increasing hazard rates, as it takes time to extract patronage. It would hardly …t
decreasing hazards, however, as the likelihood of a politician being satiated and let go should
increase over time. This alternative mechanism would have even more di¢ culty explaining
why more experienced leaders tend to hire more experienced ministers, as evident in the
data.

Counterfactual Exercises and Welfare
This section explores some important quantitative implications of our model. A critical

implication of our theory is that the incentives for leadership survival may be playing a
fundamental role in a¤ecting the political horizons of SSA ministers. While we do not model
formally how such short horizons translate in to low levels of political investment, there
is theoretical and empirical evidence in support of this mechanism. Prominently, a vast
theoretical literature pivots on myopic behavior of politicians when subject to electoral or
political risks shortening their horizon (see Amador, 2012; Aguiar and Amador, 2011). In
addition, Dal Bo and Rossi (2011) show precise quasi-experimental empirical evidence of
curtailed political investment in the context of Argentina.
This section explores some relevant counterfactual exercises that may guide our understanding of the quantitative drivers of average ministerial lifetimes in o¢ ce. Table 5 reports
four sets of counterfactuals for each country, in addition to the baseline average minister
lifetime under the baseline model for reference.
The …rst parameterization we explore is an increase in the bargaining power of ministers

30

versus the leader. We increase the technological parameter

by 10 percent of its esti-

mated value. By reducing the gap between what is captured by the minister and the leader,
leadership becomes less appealing and the loyalty of a minister hence easier to maintain.
Intuitively this reduces incentives for terminating insiders and the average length of o¢ ce
increases –sometimes substantially as in Cameroon, where it adds a full extra year in o¢ ce
to the typical minister. The reader may think of several policies aimed at adding value to the
political capital and the experience of a minister in o¢ ce that may slow down the setting in
of diminishing returns and increase . These may include administrative training programs
or international exchanges for the requali…cation of top bureaucrats, for example.
Increases in the speed of coup capacity accumulation or higher likelihood of coup success
(respectively, & c and ,both increased by 10% of their baseline values) drastically shorten
average ministerial lifetimes. This is a symmetric e¤ect relative to that discussed above. By
increasing the coup threats stemming from ministers, one forces leaders towards more ministerial churning, strongly reducing their political horizons (and possibly increasing political
myopia). These results give perspective to the indirect political e¤ects stemming from covert
or explicit foreign interventions in the African continent during the Cold War, many of which
were re‡ected in aid to the organization and implementation of coups. Francois, Rainer, and
Trebbi (2014) consider, for instance, the role of France in West Africa and the role of the US
and Soviet Union in drastically shaping threats to the leadership of SSA countries. These
results strongly complement that intuition.
In the last row, Table 5 reports the e¤ects of shortening the phase of exogenous leader
fragility, t . Interestingly, this reduction, by increasing the value of the leadership, makes
coup threats more prominent and leads to shorter average ministerial tenures. Again the
counterfactual indicates how arti…cially induced stability of leaders (e.g. several examples
of foreign protection of certain African strongmen, including Mobutu Sese, are available)
trickles down through the political equilibrium.
While Table 5 emphasizes the potential drivers of ministerial churning, Table 6 reports

31

the percent output losses due to the employment of suboptimal cabinets on the part of
leaders. The choice of weaker ministers due to their low bargaining strength is, in fact, an
important feature of our model. Table 6 shows that such welfare losses can be substantial.
If we were to endow every leader in each country with the most productive cabinet observed
in that country and based on the estimated political capital levels induced by (8), gains
hovering around 30 percent of the total political output of the cabinet in a given year could
be achievable. The losses range from a minimum of 16:8 percent in Cote d’Ivoire to a
maximum of 80:5 percent in Gabon. As we have emphasized in Section 4 of the paper, the
balance of strength between the leader and the ministers is the source of these losses.

Conclusions
This paper studies the cabinet survival of national ministers in a sample of …fteen sub-

Saharan countries since independence. We show that the hazard risks of termination of
cabinet members display increasing hazard rates, particularly over the …rst …ve years in
o¢ ce, a strikingly di¤erent pattern from that found in the same continent for hazard risks
of national leaders (which are typically decreasing in analysis time).
We show that this speci…c pattern of time dependency can be successfully rationalized
by a model in which leaders optimally select and dismiss cabinet members based on their
value (in terms of ministerial output) and on their threat as a potential replacements for the
leader.
The model provides a complete parametric representation of the ministerial hazard functions, which we then estimate structurally to derive information on the bargaining problem
between the leader and his ministers and on the dynamic process of coup capacity accumulation in these countries. The …t of the model in terms of hazard risks and survival probabilities
is excellent and the model performs well when pinned against several relevant alternatives.
We further show that the welfare losses related to ministerial bargaining are substantial.

32

Overall, these …ndings speak directly to the debate on systematic political failure in
Africa. While the continent’s recent economic history is replete with political failures taking
many forms, from civil con‡ict to patrimonialism, some of these failures have been ascribed
directly to a political class that appears myopic and rapacious. This, we postulate, may
just be a result of the speci…c institutional environment in which both ministers and leaders
operate: an environment in which power is transferred through bloodshed and is particularly
threatening to leaders. This paper, by highlighting the role of leadership survival as central to
the institutional organization of African national governments, presents a novel mechanism
in the analysis of political incentives in these weakly institutionalized systems.

Appendix
Proof of Lemma 1

Proof. Since Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) V m (ki (t) ; tl ) ; Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) < V l (ki (t) ; t) implies V m (ki (t) ; tl ) <
l
VP
(ki (t) ; t) : Minister m has incentive to mount a coup against l in period t; and will do so
if t =t0 m ( ) ci ( ) c, i.e., he has the capacity at time t: Now consider period t 1; and
i
P
suppose that t =t1 0 m ( ) ci ( ) c, i.e., minister i has capacity to mount a coup against l
i
then. Since ci (t) is drawn from C; which has non-negative support, i will also have capacity
to mount a coup against l in t: Thus, leader l will dismiss i from the ministry in t, since
he would mount a coup with certainty if he were to remain. A minister dismissed at t will
never re-enter under the current leader because, from (3) ; kim (kl ) = 1 m kl ; and kl grows
m
at 1 + g per period, whereas a dismissed minister’s capital does not grow when out of o¢ ce.
Consequently, minister m will attempt a coup at the end of period t 1: Since m0 s coup
capacity and experience are public knowledge, l will dismiss m at the start of period t 1:
Notice that this result does not depend on the relationship between Ve m (ki (t 1) ; tl ) and
V l (ki (t 1) ; t 1) ; and follows only from Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) < V l (ki (t) ; t) and the fact of
coup capacity at t 1: Consequently, in period t 2; if m has coup capacity then, he will also
have it in t 1; and therefore in t. He will be dismissed at the start of t 1; and by identical
reasoning, he will thus be dismissed at the start of t 2: The same argument
can be applied to
P
period t 3 and so on up to the …rst period, denote it t1 ; at which t1=t0 m ( ) ci ( ) c:
i

Proof of Lemma 2

Proof. Suppose
= ;: Then Ve m (ki (t0 ) ; tl )
V l (ki (t0 ) ; t0 ) implies Ve m (ki (t) ; tl )
V l (ki (t) ; t) 8t > t0 . Then, provided Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) = V m (ki (t) ; tl ) holds, minister i has
never an incentive to mount a coup against l. But a necessary condition for there to exist a t
such that Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) > V m (ki (t) ; tl ) is that there exists a
t such that Ve m (ki ( ) ; tl ) <
V l (ki ( ) ; ) is satis…ed. However, this is not possible if
= ; and Ve m (ki (t0 ) ; tl )
V l (ki (t0 ) ; t0 ), thus it must be that Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) = V m (ki (t) ; tl ). It then follows that
V m (ki (t0 ) ; tl )
V l (ki (t0 ) ; t0 ) and also for all t > t0 ; so that Ti = t0 :
Suppose = ;: Then Ve m (ki (t0 ) ; tl ) < V l (ki (t0 ) ; t0 ) implies Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) < V l (ki (t) ; t)
8t. This implies that Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) > V m (ki (t) ; tl ) 8t: But if that is the case, then it must
be that V m (ki (t) ; tl ) < V l (ki (t) ; t) 8t and Ti does not exist.
Suppose now
6= ;; and suppose that at t = sup it is the case that Ve m (ki (t) ; tl )
V l (ki (t) ; t). Then, necessarily, because t is sup , it must be that Ve m (ki ( ) ; tl )
V l (ki ( ) ; ) 8 > t. But then, necessarily, Ve m (ki ( ) ; tl ) = V m (ki ( ) ; tl ) 8 > t, so
it follows that V m (ki ( ) ; tl )
V l (ki ( ) ; ) 8 > t: This proves that then, beyond sup ;
i will never mount a coup against l. However, for ^ = sup
1, by the de…nition of sup
m
e
and the supposition that at t = sup the condition V (ki (t) ; tl )
V l (ki (t) ; t) is veri…ed,
it must be that Ve m (ki (^) ; tl ) < V l (ki (^) ; ^). Thus it follows directly from Lemma 1 that
i will mount a coup against l at ^ and at all earlier dates, if he happens to have accumulated
su¢ cient capacity to do so. Consequently Ti = sup :
Suppose 6= ;; and suppose instead that at t = sup it is the case that Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) <
V l (ki (t) ; t). Then, necessarily, we have that V m (ki (t) ; tl ) < Ve m (ki (t) ; tl ) < V l (ki (t) ; t),
34

implying that i will mount a coup against l at t = sup if he has the capacity to do so. It
also follows from the de…nition of sup that V m (ki ( ) ; tl ) < Ve m (ki ( ) ; tl ) < V l (ki ( ) ; )
8 > t: It follows directly from Lemma 1 that i will mount a coup against l at all < t =
sup if he has the capacity to do so. Consequently Ti does not exist.
Proof of Proposition 2
Proof. Since leaders have full information, if (6) fails, then minister i is not a threat, has
optimal k, and will not be terminated given " costs. If (6) holds, the minister can mount
a coup. The leader then considers i’s incentive to mount a coup. From Lemma 2, this
amounts to comparing t to the safe date Ti ; which directly implies termination if and only
if the inequality in the statement of the proposition holds.
Proof of Proposition 5
Proof. At any analysis time t0 T 0 the minister is safe and his hazard is ‡at at 1
. At
0
0
0
any analysis time t < T hazard risk 1 increments are governed by either c (t ) or Ms c (t0 )
