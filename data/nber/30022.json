    "abstract": "\n\nWhat does market power look like in a data economy? Economists typically use markups to measure market power. However, we use a simple model to show how firms\u2019 growing stocks of data can change markups, without changing their power to affect prices. Data\u2019s effects depend on how markups are aggregated. Growing data can produce differences in markup measures that match empirical facts. Markup aggregation wedges can measure data stocks and offer a way to purge markups of data\u2019s effects to reveal market power.\n\n",
