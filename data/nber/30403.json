    "abstract": "\n\nBanks\u2019 lending technology hinges on their handling of soft and hard information in dealing with different types of credit demand. Through assembling a novel dataset on banks\u2019 investment in information technologies (IT), this paper provides concrete empirical evidence on how banks adapt their lending technologies. We find investment in communication IT is associated with improving banks\u2019 ability to produce and transmit soft information, while investment in software IT helps enhance banks\u2019 hard information processing capacity. We exploit policies that affect geographic regions differentially to show causally that banks respond to an increased demand for small business credit (mortgage refinance) by increasing their spending on communication (software) IT spending. We also find that the entry of fintech induces commercial banks to increase their investment in IT\u2014more so in the software IT category.\n\n",
