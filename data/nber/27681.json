    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore the role of autonomy \u2013 defined as the freedom to choose how to spend an in-kind grant \u2013 in a context where farmers overuse fertilizer. We design and implement a field experiment that combines tailored input recommendations, extension services and an in-kind grant. The intervention decreased overall fertilizer use without reducing yields, reducing CO2 equivalent emissions by 14%. While autonomy did not adversely affect the adoption of recommended practices during the intervention, it led to substantially higher adoption two years after the intervention ended.\n\n",
