    "abstract": "\n\nRobust support for corporate income taxation is a puzzle for standard tax theory because the tax\u2019s incidence is uncertain and unreliable. We propose a resolution: if the corporate tax is seen as a benefit-based tax, its normative appeal depends on the correspondence between its incidence and that of the benefit which corporations derive from the state\u2019s activities. We show that a simple mechanism makes this correspondence exact\u2014and the net incidence of the tax zero\u2014when the tax base matches what we call the benefit base. As a result, the appeal of the corporate income tax is independent of incidence as conventionally understood.\n\n",
