ABSTRACT
Scientific research has come to dominate many American universities. Even with growing external
support, increasingly the costs of scientific research are being funded out of internal university
funds. Our paper explains why this is occuring, presents estimates of the magnitudes of start-up cost
packages being provided to scientists and engineers and then uses panel data to estimate the impact
of the growing cost of science on student/faculty ratios, faculty salaries and undergraduate
tuition.We find that universities whose own expenditures on research are growing the most rapidly,
ceteris paribus, have had the greatest increase in student faculty ratios and, in the private sector,
higher tuition increases. Thus, undergraduate students bear part of the cost of increased institutional
expenditures on research.

Introduction

Scientific research has come to dominate many American university campuses. The
growing importance of science has been accompanied by a growing flow of funds to
universities to support research from federal and state government, corporate and
foundation sources. What is not well known, however, is that an increasing share of the
costs of the research at universities is being funded out of internal university funds. So it
is natural for us to ask who bears the growing cost of the internal funds spent on research
at universities?
We begin in the next section by sketching the reason for the growing cost of
scientific research at universities and the reasons for the growing share of universities’
research costs that are funded out of internal university resources. The latter include
changes in federal indirect reimbursement cost policies and the growing cost of start-up
funds for new faculty. We present evidence on the magnitude of start-up costs that
universities face for new researchers in science and engineering fields from a survey that
we undertook during the summer of 2002 of department chairs, deans and vice presidents
of research at over 200 public and private research universities.
Our paper then turns to an estimation of who bears the costs of internal research
expenditures. Using panel data for a 21 year period for 228 research universities, we
estimate in the next section the impact of growing internal university expenditures on
research on student/faculty ratios and the substitution of lecturers for tenure track faculty,
on average faculty salaries and on tuition levels. Perhaps our most important findings are
that universities whose research expenditures per faculty member have been growing the
most rapidly in absolute terms, other factors held constant, exhibit the greatest increase in

1

student/faculty ratios and, in the private sector, the largest increases in tuition levels. So
while undergraduate students may benefit from being in close proximity to great
researchers, they also bear part of the growing costs of research in the form of larger class
sizes, fewer full-time professorial rank faculty members and higher tuition levels.
However, the magnitudes of these effects are quite small.
Finally, in the brief concluding section, we speculate on future directions that
research on the impact of the growing cost of science on academic institutions might take
and also about whether the growing efforts by universities to commercialize their faculty
members’ research may yield sufficient revenues to begin to offset the universities’
increasing costs of scientific research.

II.

The Growing Importance and Costs of Science

Scientific research has come to dominate many American university campuses and
this is reflected in the way universities are ranked. U.S News & World Report’s annual
ranking of national universities as undergraduate institutions places heavy weight on the
institutions’ expenditures per student and research expenditures are included in this total.1
The 1994 Carnegie Foundation classification of PhD granting institutions into
Research I, Research II, Doctoral I and Doctoral II institutions was heavily based on the
institutions’ volumes of external research funding and institutions strove mightily to
increase their funding to receive a higher classification in the next Carnegie classification
revision.2 Concerned that universities were placing too much weight on the volume of
their faculty members’ external research funding and not enough on the quality of their

graduate programs, Carnegie collapsed its four PhD institution categories into two in
2000 and based a university’s classification solely on the number of PhDs that the
institution produced each year.3 Over 150 institutions are now included in the category
doctoral extensive, which includes those institutions that produce the greatest number of
doctoral degrees per year. This total is up from the 87 institutions that were classified as
Research I in Carnegie’s 1994 classification.
As a result of this change, the 2000 classification “watered down” the prestige that
universities received from being included among the institutions in Carnegie’s “top”
university category. Not surprisingly, major research universities increasingly turned to
their membership in the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU), an
association of 63 major research universities, to stress their prestige and research
universities that were not currently members of the AAU increasingly sought to be
admitted.4 While the specific criteria for being considered for membership in the AAU
are not public, an institution’s volume of external research funding is clearly important.
Viewed in terms of 1998 dollars, the weighted (by faculty size) average volume of
total research and development expenditures per faculty member across 228 American
research and doctoral universities increased from about $70,000 per faculty member in
1970-1971 to about $142,340 per faculty member in 1999-2000.5 This growth in
scientific research, which was fueled by the availability of funding from government,
corporate and foundation sources, did not derive primarily from the various ranking and

Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2001).
For example, on the page of its World Wide Web Site titled “Claims to Fame”, Stony Brook University
declares, “As one of the only two universities invited this year to join the Association of American
Universities (AAU), Stony Brook becomes one of 63 members that includes such institutions as Harvard,
Yale, Johns Hopkins, Princeton and Stanford.” (http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/claims)

classification schemes, but rather from the major advances being made in science and the
importance of these advances to our society.
To take but one example, recent advances in decoding the human genome, in
advanced materials and in information sciences promise major advances in health care
treatment in the years ahead. Any university worth its salt wants to be a leader in these
fields so that it can attract top faculty, undergraduate and graduate students, increase its
research funding for its programs and potentially achieve financial returns by
commercializing its faculty members research (a point we return to below). To illustrate
the attention that institutions are paying to promoting the value of their faculty members’
research to society, table 1 summarizes the titles of some of the press releases issued by
our own university during the first 9 months of 2002 that deal with faculty research in the
health and nutrition area.
What is not well recognized, however, is that in spite of generous external support for
research, increasingly the costs of research are being borne by the universities
themselves. During the 1970-1971 to 1999-2000 period, the weighted average
institutional expenditure on research per faculty member at the 228 universities more than
tripled. As a result, the weighted average percentage of total research expenditures per
faculty member being financed out of institutional funds rose from 11.2 percent to 20.7
percent during the period (figure 1). Increasingly the academic institutions themselves are
bearing a greater share of the ever-increasing costs of scientific research.
There are a number of forces that have led to the costs of research borne by
universities to soar over the past three decades.6 Theoretical scientists, who in a previous
generation required only desks and pencils and paper, now often require supercomputers.
6

These forces are discussed in more detail in Ehrenberg (2000, chapter 6) and Ehrenberg (2003).

Experimental scientists increasingly rely on sophisticated laboratory facilities that are
increasingly expensive to build and operate. Research administration now includes strict
monitoring of financial records and environmental safety, as well as the detailed review
and monitoring of experiments involving human subjects.
Historically the federal government and other external funders, through the provision
of indirect cost recoveries, have funded much of the research infrastructure that
universities operate, as well as their research administration costs. Each institution was
allowed to mark-up the direct costs that its faculty members requested from external
funders for research support by a multiple called the indirect cost rate and the indirect
cost revenues received on successful grant applications went to support the institution’s
research administration and infrastructure costs. However, after a well-publicized case
involving Stanford University in the early 1990s, government auditors began to take a
much harder look at universities’ requests for indirect cost recoveries and put caps on the
expenses that universities could claim for expenses in a number of areas. As a result, the
average indirect cost rate at private research and doctoral universities, which was over 60
percent in 1983, fell to about 55% in 1997 and has remained near that level ever since
then.7 On average, for any given level of direct cost research funding which their faculty
members received, these private universities received 8.3% less funds from the federal
government to support their research infrastructure and administrative costs in 1997 and
thereafter than they did in 1983.

7

Indirect cost rates at the public research and doctoral universities were lower at the start of the period and
actually rose slightly during the period. The lower initial rates were due to many publics not having to
return funds to their state that the state had spent constructing new research facilities. The increase came
about because declining state support for operating budgets of public higher education made it more
important for the public universities to try to tap all available potential sources of revenue (Ehrenberg
(2000, 2003).

5

What is the likely response of an institution faced with such a reduction in external
support for research infrastructure and administration? On the one hand, it might try to
reduce its expenditures in these areas to match the decline in the external support for
research that it was receiving. But such a strategy would alienate its faculty who would
view the institution’s commitment to research as declining. In addition, if the reductions
were made in areas in which the institution was not spending more than the maximum
that the federal auditors would allow it to recover, the auditors would further respond by
lowering its indirect cost rate in the following year. So invariably private university
administrators made up for the reduction in external funding for research administration
and infrastructure by increasing their own institutional commitments.
In recent years the federal government has also placed increasing pressure on all
universities to provide “matching” institutional funds for any research proposals that they
submit. While universities try to provide matching funds out of funds that they would
have spent for research even in the absence of a new external grant, they can not always
get away with doing this, especially for large center grant proposals. Put another way, to
compete for external funding, increasingly institutions have had to bear an increasing
share of the direct costs of their faculty members’ research out of their own pockets.
Finally, as scientists’ equipment became more expensive and the competition for topquality scientists intensified, the start-up funding that universities needed to provide to
attract young scientists increased. Universities typically cannot recover these expenses in
their indirect cost revenues billings, because the new scientists rarely have external
funding when they first arrive at the university. During the late 1990s, it was often
alleged, although no systematic data existed to support this claim, that universities were

6

providing young scientists in the range of $250,000 to $500,000 to set up their labs. The
start up costs of attracting distinguished senior scientists was often alleged to be much
greater and even if these senior faculty members had federally funded research grants,
these costs too were often not recoverable in indirect cost recovery pools because the
institutions faced caps on their recoveries in a number of categories.
Because no systematic data on start up costs has previously been collected, the
Cornell Higher Education Research Institute conducted a “Survey of Start Up Costs and
Laboratory Space Allocation Rules” at research and doctoral universities during the
summer of 2002. We surveyed the chairs of 3 to 6 narrowly defined science and
engineering departments at each institution, the deans of the colleges in which each of
these departments were located and the vice president or vice provosts for research in
each university. In total 1031 department chairs, 408 deans, and 206 vice presidents or
vice provosts received survey questionnaires.
These questionnaires began by describing things that are generally included as start
up costs (such as construction or renovation of labs, materials and equipment, support for
laboratory staff, graduate assistants or postdoctoral fellows, summer salaries for the
faculty member, reduced teaching loads, travel money, unrestricted research funding) and
then asked respondents to provide information on the average and/or range of start up
costs that they incur for new assistant professors and senior faculty members in their
field, on the most expensive sub field in their discipline, on the sources of funding for
start up costs, and on the types of laboratory space allocation rules that their units used.
Full results from this survey are available on the Cornell Higher Education Research
Institute World Wide Web page (www.ilr.cornell.edu/cheri ). Table 2 summarizes some

7

of the information from the responses of the 572 department chairs (representing a
response rate of 55.0 percent) that we received. The department are grouped her into four
broad areas – physics/astronomy, biology, chemistry and engineering – and data are
reported separately for private Research I, private other, public Research I and public
other universities.
Chairs were asked to report either the average start up costs for faculty, or the range
of costs for faculty, that they had experienced in the last year or two. Some reported both
measures. Table 2 presents the average mean start up costs that the chairs reported for
new assistant professors and senior faculty, as well as the average of the high end costs
that they reported; in each case the numbers in parentheses are the number of reporting
departments in the category.8
Table 2 suggests that, with few exceptions, at the new assistant professor level
Research I universities provide larger start up packages than other universities and private
universities provide larger start up packages than public universities. Average start up
costs for assistant professors at private Research I universities in the four fields varied
between $390,237 and $489,000.9 Estimate of the average high-end (most expensive)
assistant professor start up cost package at the private Research I universities varied
across fields between $416,875 and $580,000.
Start up cost packages for senior faculty members are considerably larger. For
example, for the private Research I universities, the average start up costs varied across
fields from a low of about $700,000 in physics to a high of about $1,442,000 in
engineering. While in general the same pattern of results holds that holds for new
8

When only a range was reported, we used the midpoint of the range for the average.
Due to the large variability of the size of start up cost packages across institutions in a given field, the
differences that we observe between fields (here and below) are not statistically significant.
9

8

assistant professors, namely that packages at Research I universities are larger than
packages at non-Research I universities and packages at privates are larger than packages
at publics, sometimes at the senior level start up costs are larger at Research I publics
than at Research I privates. This may reflect efforts by some publics to move to a higher
level by bringing in a few key senior faculty members. In any event, start up costs are
clearly a major expense faced by American universities.

III.

Who Pays for the Growing Importance and Cost of Science?

How have universities responded to the growing importance and costs of science? One
might expect that the growing importance of science has provided an incentive for
universities to allocate a greater share of their faculty positions or faculty salary dollars,
to scientists. However, using data from a set of arts and sciences colleges at leading
private research universities, prior work by one of us concluded that over a 20-year
period neither the share of faculty positions nor the share of the faculty salary budget
devoted to scientists had increased at these colleges.10 Controlling for the growth of
enrollments in the various disciplines or for whether overall faculty size was increasing
or decreasing at each college, did not alter these conclusions.
Of course it may well be that the increasing cost of science is felt throughout a
university’s budget. Colleges of Arts and Sciences may receive a declining share of their
university’s total faculty positions, even if enrollment changes do not warrant this loss, as
more positions are allocated to science intensive engineering and medical colleges. This
particular hypothesis is difficult to test because some faculty in the latter two types of

10

Ehrenberg and Epifantseva (2001)

9

colleges, especially in medical colleges, are funded on soft money that they raise
themselves.
More generally, to the extent that the other sources of income that a university
receives, such as state appropriations, annual giving, and endowment income are directed
toward supporting an increasingly large scientific infrastructure, this may put upward
pressure on undergraduate tuition or cause the university to cut back its expenditures on
other areas. Inasmuch as the faculty salary bill represents a large chunk of institutional
costs, it is possible that the increasing costs of science are distributed throughout the
university in the form of slower rates of increase in faculty salaries and/or in the form of
an increase in the student/faculty ratio above the level that would otherwise prevail, all
other factors held constant. It is to tests of these hypotheses that we now turn.11
A. Does the Increasing Cost of Science Cause a Cutback in Full-time Faculty?
Table 3 uses data from a panel of 228 research and doctoral universities during the
1976-77 to 1997-98 period to explain why an institution’s ratio of full-time equivalent
undergraduate and graduate students to its full-time professorial ranked faculty varies
over time.12 The explanatory variables, all measured in 1998 dollars, are the institution’s
research expenditures per professorial ranked faculty out of its own internal funds, the
share of its enrollments that are in PhD and nonprofessional masters programs, the level
of contributions that it received during the year from all sources per student, its
endowment per student, and its state appropriation per student. Undergraduate tuition and

fees levels are omitted as an explanatory variable because they are treated as an
endogenous outcome in our work.
All equations also include institutional fixed effects and, as a result, our estimates
indicate the impacts of changes over time in the explanatory variables on student/faculty
ratios. Separate estimates are provided for private and for public universities and, for
each sample, we estimate models without and with year fixed effects. The inclusion of
year fixed effects allows for the possibilities that there are omitted macro level variables
that influence student/faculty ratios and our other outcomes and we view these estimates
as our preferred estimates.13
Our key finding is found in the first row of the table. Other factors held constant,
universities whose research expenditures are increasing the fastest in absolute terms are
also the ones whose student/faculty ratios are increasing the fastest. The magnitude of the
relationship is greater in the specification that includes year fixed effects for private
universities than it is for publics and we cannot reject the hypothesis for the former that
each $10,000 increase in internal research expenditures per faculty member is associated
with an increase in the student/faculty ratio of close to 0.5 . During the period the
weighted average real institutional research expenditure per faculty member at the private
universities in the sample increased from about $7.7 to $17.5 thousand dollars. So on
average, the increase in internal research expenditures per faculty member at the privates
has caused an increase in student/faculty ratios at them of close to 0.5 during the period,

13

For example, increases in the unemployment rate may increase students’ financial need, which in turn
will put pressure on institution’s financial aid budgets and influences the salaries that it can afford to pay its
faculty and its student/faculty ratio.

11

as compared to what the student/faculty ratios would have been if the increase in internal
research expenditures had not taken place.14
The magnitude of the relationship is somewhat lower for the public university
sample, .130 in the specification that includes year fixed effects. However, the growth in
absolute terms of real research expenditures per faculty member out of internal university
funds has been larger for the public universities; the weighted average for public
universities in the sample rose from about $7.6 to $31.3 during the period. Hence the
impact of the increase in public universities expenditures on research out of their own
funds on student/faculty ratios has probably been somewhat smaller, increasing, other
factors held constant, by about 0.3 during the period.
Our estimates of the impact of changing internal expenditures on research on the
student/faculty ratio prove to be robust to a number of specification changes. Including
full-time equivalent student enrollments on the right hand side of the equation did not
alter the finding. When we used five-year averages for each institution to capture longerrun changes we found larger student/faculty ratio effects, although they tended to be less
statistically significant because of the reduction in our sample sizes.
When we repeated the analyses, using total full-time faculty (including lecturers and
instructors) in the denominator of the student/faculty ratio rather than professorial ranked
faculty, similar positive coefficients on the research expenditure per faculty member
variable were obtained. However, the magnitudes of these coefficients were somewhat
smaller than the coefficients in the first row of table 3 in most of the specifications.
Hence while the data suggest that an increase in research expenditures per ranked faculty

14

Appendix figure 1 indicates that during the sample period, student faculty ratios actually only rose
slightly at private Research I universities and fell at other private universities in our sample.

12

member probably does lead to some substitution of full-time lecturers and instructors for
professorial ranked faculty, the ratio of students to all faculty (including the lecturers and
instructors) also increases when institutional expenditures on research per ranked faculty
member increases.
Briefly mentioning other findings from table 3, in the main year-to-year changes in
total giving per student do not appear to significantly alter an institution’s student/faculty
ratio. Increases in endowment per student are associated with increases in student/faculty
ratios for the private research universities but decreases in student/faculty ratios for the
public research universities. Increases in the levels of state appropriations per student are
similarly associated with decreases in student/faculty ratios for the public universities.
What is striking is the impact of changing the share of the total student body enrolled
in PhD and nonprofessional masters programs. In the private institutions, growing the
share of these programs is associated, other factors held constant, with a higher
student/faculty ratio, while in the public institutions it is associated with a lower
student/faculty ratio. The private result is intuitive; growing PhD programs may require
more money for graduate assistantships and the substitution of graduate assistants for
full-time faculty. The public finding is less intuitive. A number of states provide more
resources per student to public universities for graduate students than undergraduate
students and this might lead to a lower student/faculty ratio. However, we have already
controlled for state appropriations per student in our model, so this cannot be the
explanation for this finding.

13

B. Does the Increasing Cost of Science Cause a Slow Down in Faculty Salary
Increases?
Table 4 provides estimates of equations similarly specified to those found in table 3,
save that the dependent variable is now the real weighted (across ranks) average faculty
salary at the institution. Focusing on the specifications with year fixed effects, for both
types of institutions we find evidence that increasing an institution's internal research
expenditures per faculty member leads, other factors equal, to higher (not lower) faculty
salaries. This may reflect reverse causality – high paid faculty members with strong
research records being recruited and requiring (see the previous section) considerable
funding for start up costs.
Increases in giving levels per student and endowment per student are associated for
privates with greater increases in faculty salaries. Similarly increases in state
appropriations per student are associated in public universities with increases in average
faculty salaries. An increase in the share of students that are in PhD or nonprofessional
masters programs is associated with higher average salaries in both sectors; this may
again reflect the university’s need to hire better and more highly paid faculty with larger
PhD programs.
C. Does the Increasing Cost of Science Cause Increases in Tuition Levels?
Table 5 provides similarly specified equations, save that now the dependent variable
is the institution’s real tuition level. The results suggest that private universities that
increase their expenditures per faculty member out of their own funds on research, other
factors held constant also increase their tuition levels at higher rates. However, the
magnitude of the relationship differs substantially in the models with and without year

14

fixed effects. Treating the two coefficients as upper and lower bounds to the true
relationship, given that the weighted average internal expenditures on research at private
universities in the sample increased by about $10,000 per faculty member over the
period, our estimates suggest that undergraduate tuition levels at these institution were
between $165 and $945 higher in real terms in 1998 than they otherwise would have
been. While we view the lower bound estimate, the one coming from the model that
included year fixed effects, as the preferred one, even the larger estimate is small
compared to the average tuition and fee level of over $20,000 that prevailed at selective
private research universities in that year.
All the models suggest that as the share of PhD and nonprofessional masters’
students’ increases at these universities that tuition levels also increase, other factors held
constant. During the period, these shares rose, on average, from .240 to .306 at the private
research universities and from .145 to .178 at the public research universities. Our
estimates thus imply that tuition levels at the private research universities were between
$336 (model with year fixed effects) and $2049 (model without year fixed effects), and
those at the public research universities between $50 (model with year fixed effects) and
$299 (model without year fixed effects) higher at the end of the period, in real terms, than
would otherwise have been the case.
Hence, other factors held constant, undergraduate students bear some of the cost of
increased size PhD programs in the form of higher tuitions.15 We place greater weight on
the lower bound estimates that are based on models that include year fixed effects,

15

We should stress, in keeping with the views of Gordon Winston (1999), that we are not saying that
undergraduate students are subsidizing Ph.D. students. Rather, all students attending the research
universities receive subsidies and growing the relative size of Ph.D. programs simply reduces the size of
the monetary subsidy that undergraduate students receive.

15

because omitted macro level variables, such as family income, influence students’
financial need and ability to afford to attend college, and thus likely influence tuition.
Hence the costs that the undergraduate students bear are probably not very large. In
addition, if growing PhD programs attract better faculty to universities, undergraduate
students may also benefit from increases in the relative size of these programs.
Increased annual giving per student and increased endowment per student are both
statistically significantly associated with higher levels of tuition per student. Higher
levels of endowment and annual giving provide increased subsidies for students, increase
the attractiveness of the university to students and hence should increase the tuition levels
that students are willing to pay to attend the university.16 Results for the increase in state
appropriations per student are more mixed, without the inclusion of year fixed effects
state appropriations per student are positively associated with tuition increases in the
public sector, but in the preferred specification, when the year effects are included, the
relationship becomes negative. 17
D. Some Sensitivity Analyses
Tables 6, 7 and 8 provide two different types of sensitivity analysis for the impact of
changes in institutional expenditures on research per faculty member on student/faculty
ratios, average faculty salaries and tuition levels, respectively. First, we test whether the
relationship differs across Research I and other universities in the sample. Second, we see
16

Again see Gordon Winston’s (1999). Empirical evidence that in-state and out-of-state tuition levels are
positively associated with levels of endowment per student at public university is also found in Rizzo and
Ehrenberg (forthcoming).
17
Of the 23 private research universities receiving state appropriations, 14 were in New York State and
under the Bundy Aid program these institutions received grants for each New York State resident who
received a degree from them. During the sample period, the real value of the Bundy aid per graduate
declined, as did the share of their graduates coming from New York State. Thus, the negative coefficient of
the state aid variable in the private tuition equation may simply reflect the increased need for tuition
revenue that they faced as this source of revenue was falling. Once we control for year specific effects, this
negative coefficient becomes statistically insignificant for private institutions.

16

how the estimated relationships differ when we estimate a more complex model in which
changes in annual giving, research per faculty member out of external funds and state
appropriations are treated as endogenous.
Our changes in external research per faculty member equation allows these changes
to depend upon changes that the institution makes in institutional research expenditures
per faculty member (through the route of start-up costs, matching funds and more general
research infrastructure support), changes in the national research budgets that different
government agencies are receiving, and the shares of external research funding in the
prior year that an institution received from the various agencies. So, for example, holding
the change in institutional research funding constant, institutions that derive a greater
share of their external research budget from NIH should see greater increases in their
external research funding than institutions that derive a greater share of their research
funding from NSF, when the NIH research budget rises relative to the NSF research
budget.
Previous research has shown that at private research universities higher levels of total
research spending per faculty member are associated with higher levels of annual
giving.18 So we also estimate a change in annual giving equation that allows this change
to depend upon the change in total research expenditures per faculty member at the
institution. Finally, some states explicitly or implicitly reward institutions for increasing
their volumes of external research funding and so we estimate changes in state
appropriations per student equations that are specified to depend upon institutions’
changes in external research volume per faculty member.

18

Ehrenberg and Smith (forthcoming)

17

In the context of this more complex model, a change in internal research expenditures
per faculty member will directly affect each of our three outcomes and indirectly affect
them through its effect on the change in external research expenditures, which in turn
may affect state appropriations per student and (along with the change in institutional
research expenditures per student) annual giving per student.
Table 6 presents estimates of the coefficient of the internal research expenditures per
faculty member variable in the student/faculty equation for various models. The top row
of the first two columns (under “baseline”), reports the coefficient estimates from table 3.
The next two rows report similar coefficients when the data are stratified into to Research
I and other institutions. Statistically significant effects on the student/faculty ratio appear
primarily for the Research I universities.
The next four columns display the estimated coefficients of the internal research
expenditure per faculty member variable when first giving and external research
expenditures and then these two variables plus state appropriations are treated as
endogenous in the model. The coefficients of the internal research expenditure variables
are remarkably robust to the two sets of endogenity assumptions.
Table 7 presents the similar coefficient estimates from the faculty salary equation.
Changes in internal research expenditures per faculty member are positively associated
with changes in faculty salaries primarily at public institutions, with the magnitude of the
effects being largest at the Non Research I institutions, the ones that probably need to
offer higher salaries to attract more research oriented faculty. Again, treating changes in
annual giving, external research expenditures and state appropriations as endogenous,
does not substantially alter any of these coefficients.

18

Finally, table 8 presents the coefficient of the internal research expenditure per
faculty member variable in the tuition equation. The major finding here is that it is the
non Research I private institutions at which the largest impacts on tuition is observed.
Again treating the changes in annual giving, external research expenditures and state
appropriations as endogenous does not substantially alter any of the coefficients.
To compute the total impact of changes in institutional research expenditures on each
outcome requires us to know the impact of changes in internal research expenditures on
external research expenditures, changes in external research expenditures on state
appropriations and changes in total research expenditures on annual giving per students.
Appendix table 1 summarizes the key coefficients that we obtained. For example, at the
private research universities giving per student increases by about $395 in response to
each $10,000 per faculty member increase in total research volume and external research
expenditures per faculty member increase by about $17,300 for each $10,000 increase in
institutional research expenditures per faculty member, all other variables held constant.
We find, however, no evidence that increases in external research volume per faculty
member is statistically significantly related to state appropriations per student.
One can then use these coefficients, as well as the coefficients from the outcome
models that were previously reported to compute the total effect of changes in internal
research expenditures per faculty members on each of the outcomes. These are the direct
effects that operate through the coefficient of this variable in each equation, as well as the
indirect effects that operate through the effects of changes in institutional expenditures on
research per faculty member on the other variables that we treated as endogenous.

19

Table 9 summarizes our findings. The row titled “basic model” summarizes the
effects that we obtained from the baseline models that were presented in tables 6, 7 and 8.
The following rows summarize the direct effects, the indirect effects and the total effects
from the model that allows for the endogenity of external research per faculty member,
annual giving and state appropriations. The magnitudes of the effects in the total effects
row are very similar to the magnitudes of the effects in the basic model row. On balance,
treating these other variables as endogenous does not alter any of our main findings.

Concluding Remarks

Our research suggests that undergraduate students bear at least part of the increased
costs that American universities are undertaking for their faculty members’ scientific
research in the forms of higher student-faculty ratios, some substitution of lecturers for
professorial rank faculty and, in private universities, higher tuition levels. However, the
magnitudes of these effects are surprisingly (to us) small. Whether these costs are more
than offset by the benefits the students receive from being educated in proximity to
scientific researchers who are at the cutting edge of their disciplines is an open question
that deserves serious study.
Our research also suggests that as the share of PhD students and nonprofessional
masters’ students increases at both the public and private research universities that
undergraduate tuition also increases at these universities, other factors held constant.
While Gordon Winston’s (1999) work indicates that no undergraduate student at a major
university bears the full cost of his or her education, our results suggest the
undergraduates bear a part of the cost of graduate education, in the sense that the average
subsidy (in Winston’s terms) that they receive from attending the university is lower

20

because of the presence of more graduate students. Again whether these costs are more
than offset by the benefits that the students receive from being educated close to (and
sometimes by) graduate students is an open question deserving of serious study.
Our study has only begun to touch on the impact on the university that institutions’
growing cost of science has had. The relatively small impacts that we observed on
student/faculty ratios may mask decreases in scientists teaching loads that have taken
place, which in turn may have led to larger class sizes. The growth of science may have
crowded out other things. For example, increased institutional support for teaching or
research assistants for scientists and for stipends for graduate students in the sciences
may have led to decreased availability of funds to support teaching assistants or graduate
students on fellowships for humanists and social scientists, or slower rates of growth of
graduate student stipends in these fields.19 Or to take another example, increased
institutional support for scientific research facilities and start-up costs for scientists may
have reduced the funding that otherwise would have been available for travel and other
“perks” in the humanities and social sciences.
It is possible, of course, that the increasing costs of research that are borne by
universities may be eventually at least partially offset by revenues that the universities
receive from increased commercialization of their faculty members’ research. The
Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) reported in their fiscal year
2000 survey of their members that American colleges and universities received more than
$1 billion dollars in licensing income and other forms of royalties relating to patents that
year. While this figure seems large, it was concentrated in a few large “winners”; 90% of
19

It is not surprising that the leaders of the growing movement to union graduate assistants on private
university campuses tend to be graduate students from the humanities and soft social sciences (Ehrenberg
et. al forthcoming).

21

the universities in their sample received less than $2 million and almost half received less
than $1 million.20
Licensing income received in one year depends upon the flow of investments in
research that universities have made in the past. If we ignore this and the fact that the
return on any particular research project may occur for a number of years in the future, a
simple way of looking at the commercial returns that universities receive from their
faculty members’ research is to ask how the licensing income received by a university in
one year relates to its own expenditures on research in that year. Licensing income
received in fiscal year 2000 averaged 3.23% of total research expenditures in the year
across the institutions in the AUTM sample. As we have noted, universities fund about
20% of their research expenditures out of their own resources, which suggests that
licensing income averaged about 16% of institutions’ research expenditures out of
internal university funds in the year.
At first glance this seems like a significant return but this calculation is misleading for
at least three reasons. First, the licensing income that universities receive is divided
between the university and the researchers. So only a share of the revenue actually comes
to the university itself. Second, focusing on the average ratio ignores the skewness in the
distribution of research returns. The median institution in the sample licensing income
was 0.83% of its total research revenue, which is about 4.2% of its internal volume of
research expenditures. Third, given the volume of a university’s research, licensing
income and other forms of revenue from patents that are related to this research do not
simply fall off trees. Rather, they must be “harvested”. Considerable efforts must be

See Blumenstyk (2002a). Some of these large winners were universities that cashed in equity positions
that they had taken in companies, in lieu of receiving licensing income.

22

made by universities and their faculty members to decide if faculty members’ discoveries
have potential commercial value, to patent the discoveries, to then develop or seek
partners to develop commercial potential, to negotiate licenses or equity positions, and to
enforce patents.21 All of these activities take resources. Indeed, the cost of trying to
enforce patents alone can prove very expensive.22
While no comprehensive source of data on the costs that universities occur in trying
to generate licensing income is currently available, summary information from the
AUTM licensing survey permits us to make some back of the envelope calculations.
During fiscal year 2000, the 142 U.S universities in the AUTM sample employed a total
of 479.95 “licensing” full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) and 494.53 other FTEs in
their technology transfer offices. They also incurred $117,927,842 in legal fees, of which
third parties reimbursed only $53,685,716.23 Hence these universities’ net legal fees for
technology transfer activities were roughly $64 million and they employed a total of
about 975 employees. These employees include patent attorneys, other professionals and
support staff. If we assume that the fully loaded costs of each employee (salaries,
benefits, office space etc.) averaged $100,000 that year, the total expenses of technology
transfer activities for these institutions were in the range of $161.5 million dollars, or an
average of about $1.15 million per university.
Maintaining the assumption that the average fully loaded cost of each employee was
$100,000, the AUTM survey responses allow us to compute an estimate of the net
21

Thursby and Thursby (2000) describe this process in much more detail and provide estimates of licensing
production functions.

The University of Rochester has established an “eight figure” legal fund in its effort to obtain billions of
dollars in royalties from the makers and marketers of the arthritis drug Celebrex (Blumenstyck 2002b).
Recently, a federal district court judge ruled against the University and the case is now under appeal
(Blumenstyck 2003).

licensing income (income after expenses) for 138 of the universities in the sample. The
mean net licensing income in this sample was $6,554,200, but the median was only
$343,952. By our calculations 51 of the 138 institutions actually lost income that year on
their commercialization activities and we estimate that the median net licensing income
for the 87 that made money was $1,309,828. When one remembers that the licensing
income received by universities is split between them and the faculty members whose
patents have generated the income, it seems clear that commercialization of research has
yet to provide most universities with large amounts of net income to support the
universities’ scientific research activities.

Instruments include above exogenous variation plus: instruments created that represent the share of an
institution's federal research expenditures that come from a given federal agency, times the change in that agency's
budget. The agencies include the USDA, Department of Defense, NASA, NSF, Department
of Health and Human Services and All Other Agencies. Other instruments include each institution's share
of total research expenditures among its different academic disciplines, including Engineering, Life Sciences,
Physical Sciences, Psychology, Social Sciences and Other Disciplines.
