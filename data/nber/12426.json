I start by describing the current state of the Israeli economy and monetary policy and economic developments during the past year.  I then review a series of issues that have arisen during the past year.  Among them are: the monetary mechanism, which is unusual because exchange rate changes have a very rapid impact on prices; the role of inflation and interest rate expectations in policy decisions; the role of the interest rate gap with the US; the role of the Governor as chief economic adviser to the Government; banking supervision; and management and political issues.\n\n",
