    "abstract": "\n\nThe Subjective ex ante Treatment Effect is the difference between the probabilities of an outcome conditional on a treatment. The SeaTE yields ex ante causal effects at the individual level. The paper gives an interpretation in two workhorse econometric frameworks: potential outcomes and dynamic programming. It finds large effect heterogeneity of health on work in two surveys of older workers, the VRI and the HRS. It shows how reduced-form estimates of health on work are biased when there is unobserved heterogeneity in taste for work. Using the VRI\u2019s panel structure, it validates the elicited conditional probabilities of work given health.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nThis research uses data from the Vanguard Research Initiative (VRI) that was developed by a research team under a program project grant from the National Institute on Aging P01-AG026571. The Vanguard Group Inc. supported the data collection of the VRI. Vanguard\u2019s Client Insight Group and IPSOS SA were responsible for implementing the VRI survey and provided substantial input into its design. John Ameriks, Andrew Caplin, and Matthew D. Shapiro are co-principal investigator of the VRI. The design of the VRI benefited from the collaboration and assistance of Joseph Briggs, Wandi Bruine de Bruin, Alycia Chin, Mi Luo, Minjoon Lee, Brooke Helppie McFall, Ann Rodgers, and Christopher Tonetti as part of the program project, from Annette Bonner (Vanguard), and Wendy O\u2019Connell (IPSOS SA). This project uses Survey 4 of the VRI that was designed by Ameriks, Briggs, Caplin, Lee, Shapiro, and Tonetti.  The conditional probability battery used in this paper, which was included in VRI Survey 4 and a module of the HRS 2016, was designed in collaboration with Michael Hurd, Peter Hudomiet, Gabor Kezdi, Susann Rohwedder, and Robert Willis.
