    "abstract": "\n\nA longstanding and influential view in U.S. correctional policy is that \u201cnothing works\u201d when it comes to rehabilitating incarcerated individuals. We revisit this hypothesis by studying an innovative law-enforcement-led program launched in the county jail of Flint, Michigan: Inmate Growth Naturally and Intentionally Through Education (IGNITE). We develop an instrumental variable approach to estimate the effects of IGNITE exposure, which leverages quasi-random court delays that cause individuals to spend more time in jail both before and after the program\u2019s launch. Holding time in jail fixed, we find that one additional month of IGNITE exposure reduces weekly misconduct within jail and three-month recidivism by 25% and 24%, respectively, with the recidivism effects growing over time. Surveys of staff and community members, along with administrative test score records and within-jail text messages, suggest that cultural change and improved literacy and numeracy scores as contributing mechanisms.\n\n",
