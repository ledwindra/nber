The emphasis is on the implications of different degrees of capital mobility. One of the topics taken up is the conflict between the role of the real exchange rate as a signaling device for long-run resource allocation and the problem of real exchange rate appreciation accompanying the opening up of an economy to short-term capital inflow. Also discussed is the related choice of exchange rate policy as an anti-inflation device.\n\n",
