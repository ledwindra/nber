We use an indirect inference procedure to estimate the structural parameters of a rich specification of capital adjustment costs. In effect, the parameters are optimally chosen to reproduce the nonlinear relationship between investment and profitability that we uncover in the plant-level data. Our findings indicate that a model which mixes both convex and nonconvex adjustment costs with irreversibility fits the data best.\n\n",
