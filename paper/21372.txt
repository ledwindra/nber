NBER Working Paper No. 21372
July 2015, Revised August 2015
JEL No. H56,J4
ABSTRACT
We show a statistically significant and quantitatively meaningful decline in the intelligence of Marine
Officers from 1980 to 2014 as measured by their scores on the General Classification Test (GCT)
which has been shown to be a good predictor of success in the military. This contrasts with the increasing
quality of enlisted personnel since 1973 when conscription ended. We argue that the source of this
decline is the greater number of young Americans in college since Marine officers must have a four-year
degree. The increasing diversity of the pool of incoming officers has not contributed to the decline
in GCT scores.

Introduction
The question of “Who serves when not all serve?” has been a central issue in

the all-volunteer United States military, even before the end of conscription in
1973.1 Advocates for the end of the peace-time draft argued conscription was, in the
words of Milton Friedman, “inequitable and arbitrary, seriously interfer[ing] with
the freedom of young men to shape their lives.”2 Others, however, were concerned
with the potential quality of an all-volunteer force.3 Given the strong link between
intelligence and job performance, the military has measured the quality of its
enlisted force by their scores of intelligence tests. While the military services
initially faced challenges in attracting high-quality enlisted personnel, the problems
seemed to have been resolved by the late 1980s. Bernard Rostker, one of the
foremost experts on military manpower analysis, declared in his 2006 RAND
monograph I Want You that “the alternative to the draft, the all-volunteer force, has
been a resounding success for the American military and the American people.”4
Even during the most trying years of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, around 60
percent of new recruits were deemed “high-quality,” possessing a high school
diploma and being above the average intelligence of the American population
(compared to a low of 27.1 percent of new recruits deemed high-quality in 1977).

The success of the volunteer military in attracting high quality enlisted
recruits, however, does not necessarily carry over with respect to its ability to
attract high-quality officers.5 Commissioned officers comprise about 16 percent of
the military, but they make up its leadership and exert a disproportionate impact
on military effectiveness. The importance of the intellectual capability of officers is
explicitly stated in the foundational Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication 1 (1997)
“A leader without either interest in or knowledge of the history and theory
of warfare—the intellectual content of the military profession—is a leader in
appearance only. Self-directed study in the art and science of war is at least
equal in importance to maintaining physical condition and should receive at
least equal time. This is particularly true among officers; after all, the mind
is an officer's principal weapon.” (p. 64)
There is anecdotal evidence of a decline of intelligence in the officer corps; Major
John Jordan writes in the Marine Corps Gazette in 2014
“A frequent topic of discussion in the pages of the Marine Corps Gazette is
the difficulty of developing critical thinking skills in Marine Officers. The
persistence of this theme implies that these essential skills are not as
prevalent as they need to be; in fact, most Marines could easily point to
examples of officers of any grade who seemingly lack these faculties.”6
There is also deep concern about the consequences of this lack of critical thinking
skills among the officer corps in a military that increasingly emphasizes “maneuver
warfare” in which control is decentralized and in which junior officers must have a
command of technical skills, be sensitive to the social environment and culture in
which he or she is deployed, and plan and implement complex operations.7
In the American military, officers are said to receive a commission for service rather than enlisting. Enlisted
personnel can be promoted to be non-commissioned officers, but these positions are distinct from those of
commissioned officers (who are simply called officers, the term we will henceforth use in this paper).

Up until now, however, there has been no systematic study of trends in officer
intelligence, nor of what factors are most influential on the average intelligence of
incoming officers. In this paper, we show that the intelligence of officers in the
Marines, as measured by scores on the General Classification Test (GCT), a test
that all officers take, has steadily and significantly declined since 1980.8 For
example, the GCT score in 1980 that demarcated the lower one-third of new officers
that year demarcated the lower two-thirds of the new officers in 2014. While 85
percent of those taking the test in 1980 exceeded 120, the cut-off score for Marine
officers in World War 2,9 only 59 percent exceeded that score in 2014. At the upper
end of the distribution, 4.9% of those taking the test scored above 150 in 1980
compared to 0.7% in 2014. This negative trend could contribute to adverse
consequences for military effectiveness and national security.
We also examine the relationship between the annual averages of these test
scores and the size and composition of the pool of potential officers (i.e., college
graduates), labor market conditions, and the ethnic, racial and gender composition
of incoming officers. We find that the dominant correlate to the declining GCT
scores over time is the expansion of the pool of potential officers as the ranks of
college graduates has risen over the past three decades. There is no evidence that
the increasing proportion of women or African Americans in the ranks of incoming
officers are independent causes of the decrease in test scores, and while in some

Recruits who took General Classification Test (GCT) from 1980 to 2014. The data provided do not include any
individual level characteristics, such as race or gender, in order to preserve privacy for the test takers.

specifications there is a significant effect of the proportion of incoming Hispanic
officers on these scores, largely because of the rapid increase of Hispanics attending
college, the quantitative effect of this on the average GCT is very small,
representing only about 5 percent of the decline; the other 95 percent is due to the
expansion of the pool of non-Hispanic college students.
The next section of this paper traces the history of intelligence testing by the
American military in the 20th century. This section also includes a brief discussion
of America’s return to an All-Volunteer Force in 1973. Section III presents our
analysis of the GCT individual-level data that shows a steady and significant
decline in the mean scores across the period 1980 to 2014 as well as a significant
shift in the distribution of the scores. Section IV presents a regression analysis of
the partial correlates of annual mean test scores with the characteristics of the
potential pool of officer candidates, the gender, racial, and ethnic characteristics of
the candidates, and labor market and other factors that could potentially affect the
quality of incoming officers and, therefore, the GCT scores. We offer some
concluding comments in Section V.

II.

The General Classification Test
The military developed new intelligence tests at the beginning of World War

II in order to classify incoming servicemen during the huge buildup of forces. The
Army General Classification Test (initially called the AGCT to distinguish it from
the Navy’s test, but subsequently called simply the GCT) was given to all entering
service members due to its utility in sorting initial entrants into the military. By
the end of the war, over 12 million men and women had taken this test. The GCT
was designed to have a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 20 (standard
IQ tests have standard deviations of 15). Those who took the test were placed in
one of five categories, with Category I being those with the highest scores. In a
1946 Science article, one of the creators of the test, Walter V.D. Bingham, stated
that the average score for college graduates was 130, which was the lower boundary
for a test-taker to place in Category I.
The link between intelligence, as measured by the GCT, and military
performance was systematically studied during World War II. Research found that
enlisted soldiers in Category IV or V (those with GCT scores below 90) were not able
to learn at the same pace as soldiers of average mental ability, and Special Training
Units were established to prepare these men for basic training.10 Studies also
showed that the GCT was a powerful tool for predicting officer performance in basic
training. In World War II, enlistees in the army without a college degree who
scored above 110 on the GCT were considered for Officer Candidate School (OCS),

which was used to train and screen potential officers (those with a four-year college
degree could be commissioned without taking the GCT). A candidate’s GCT score
was found to be highly correlated with his or her success at OCS.11 In fact, there
was much debate about whether 110 was a sufficiently high minimum score for
enlistees to enroll in OCS since most of the failures at that school were from
candidates who scored between 110 and 115.12
The GCT had been replaced by the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude
Battery (ASVAB) by the time the All-Volunteer Force (AVF) began in 1973 for all
branches of the services. Out of all the services, the GCT is only still administered
in the Marine Corps, and there only to officers. The GCT was found to be highly
predictive of officers’ success at The Basic School, a six-month training course that
all new Marine officers take in Quantico, Virginia.13 While the importance of the
GCT in deciding a young officer’s Military Occupational Specialty has declined,
those who take it continue to treat it as a serious and important requirement.14
All candidates to become officers in the Marines, except those coming from
the Naval Academy, must complete Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Quantico,
Virginia, as well as completing a four-year Bachelor degree.15 There are several
programs that may take an aspiring officer candidate to OCS, such as the Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) or the Platoon Leader’s Class (PLC).
Palmer (1948).
The minimum score for Marine Officers in World War 2 was 120: (Nalty and Moody, 1970)
13 Stoloff (1983).
14 Anecdotally, one of the authors can attest to the seriousness with which it was taken when he was a
lieutenant at The Basic School in 2009; it is hard to find a group of young people quite as earnest and
competitive as new Marine lieutenants.
15 Graduates of the Naval Academy typically represent around 15% to 20% of each year’s group of new Marine
officers.

OCS represents the primary screening tool for Marine officers, with grades
determined through a combination of physical fitness, academic, and leadership
evaluations. There is usually a 40% attrition rate at OCS. Failure is not often due
to academic evaluations; in fact, academic talent is not a good predictor of success at
OCS.16 Rather, most failures come from orthopedic injuries that arise because of
the physical intensity of the course, or from failures to exhibit leadership.17 Those
candidates that successfully complete OCS are commissioned as second lieutenants
upon receipt of their Bachelor’s degree (or upon completion of OCS if they already
have their degree). One could offer a simple formula for creating a Marine officer in
the years of the AVF: OCS completion + 4-year Bachelor’s degree = an officer.
After commissioning, all Marine officers go to a six-month course called The
Basic School (TBS) in Quantico, Virginia. Newly-commissioned lieutenants
attending The Basic School learn infantry tactics and general knowledge about the
Marine Corps. It is here that lieutenants take the GCT, at a consistent time in
their careers and in a consistent environment (as opposed to, say, being
administered by a recruiter in varying conditions). The Basic School is an
academically intense experience, and success there is strongly predicted by a
lieutenant’s score on the GCT.18

Stoloff (1983).
If a candidate fails five academic tests, then they are supposed to fail the course. According to Stoloff (1983),
however, this rarely happens. Anecdotally, when one of the authors was at OCS, a few candidates failed five
tests but were prevented from being kicked out by instructors who placed a high value on physical fitness. A
similar result has been found for Army Officer Candidate School (Allen, Bynum, Oliver, Russell, Young, and
Babin, 2014).

The GCT provides a valuable source of consistently normed test data; unlike
the ASVAB, which is normed every 15-20 years, and the SAT, for which there are
different versions given every year, the data from the GCT can be compared across
years because the questions remain the same and the scores are not re-normalized.
Along with consistency, another reason to consider the GCT is relevance. According
to the 2009 version of the Marine Corps Order on Testing, “…the GCT is generally
used as a metric for measuring the intellectual health of the officer corps.” 19 The
intellectual health of junior officers is especially important in the military because
there is no lateral entry into mid-level management positions and there is an “up or
out” promotion system. This means that the military pays a premium in order to
attract especially high quality junior officers, as the most senior leaders in twenty
years must be chosen from amongst them.20 Additionally, it has been shown that
more intelligent officers themselves benefit more from the mentoring of successful
senior officers.21 If the ‘intellectual health’ of new officers suffers, it affects the
military not just in the short term, but for a long time. In the next section, we
investigate the evolution of this health over the past 35 years.

III. GCT Scores, 1980 to 2014
We received data on the GCT scores of all officers at The Basic School from
Fiscal Year 1980 to Fiscal Year 2014 through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request to the Marine Corps.22 The data we obtained (over 46,000 observations)
included only the test scores, with no other individual-level information, for reasons
of privacy. As we show in this section, there was a statistically significant decline
in these scores over time and the magnitude of the change is relevant given the
distribution of the scores.
Table 1 presents statistics for the mean, standard deviation, range and
number of observations for every fifth year of the sample, beginning with 1980, and
including the information from the last year for which we have data (2014) as well.
The table shows a steady decline in the average test scores. Figure 1 presents the
mean GCT score along with the 95 percent confidence interval of the mean for 1980
to 2014. The figure shows that the decline in the mean was not monotonic, but the
general downward path is evident. The average annual rate of decrease during this
period was 0.19 percent per year, giving a cumulative change of 6.6 percent. This

22 We received only 272 observations for 2013 (which is roughly the size of one class of TBS), a year in which,
according to the Marine Corps Times, over 1,400 Marine officers joined the Corps (to put this in context, we
have 1,320 observations for 2012). In the analysis that follows, we do not use the 2013 observations.

The means and standard errors of the means presented in Figure 1 suggest
that there was a significant decline in the average GCT score over time. Table 2
confirms this. The statistics reported in this table represent t-tests of the
differences in means in 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010. These differences increase with
the difference in years, and are significant at better than the 99 percent level of
confidence for each ten, twenty and thirty year interval presented in this table.

In response to a separate FOIA request (DON-USMC-2014-009339), Marine Corps Recruiting Command
provided the average SAT scores of new officers from 2005-2014 (the average SAT scores for officers before 2005
are not available). According to the scores provided, the average SAT for new Marine Officers is well above the
average SAT for college bound high-school seniors; for example the average for officers in 2014 was 1,200, as
compared to the overall average of 1,010 for college-bound high school seniors. This is consistent with the result
in 1980, as reported by Stoloff, when the average SAT for Marine officers was 1,050, as compared to 860 overall.

Figure 2 illustrates the change in the distribution of GCT scores in 1980,
1990, 2000 and 2010. This figure shows a steady leftward shift in the kernel
distribution of scores across the decades. The Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test allows us
to consider whether these distributions significantly differ across time.24 The Dstatistics for these tests, and the associated p-values, are provided in Table 3. The
statistics in this table show that, in fact, there is a significant difference in the
distribution between each ten-year period, as well as between the longer periods
(1980 vs. 2000, 1980 vs. 2010, and 1990 vs. 2010). Thus, the distributions of test
scores, as well as their means, exhibit a decline decade-by-decade. In the next
section, we investigate possible causes of the decline in average annual GCT scores.

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test generates the D-statistic that can be used to test whether two distributions are
statistically distinct, with larger values of this statistic associated with lower p-values for the null hypothesis
that the two distributions are not different.

IV. Determinants of GCT Scores
The decline in the average GCT scores documented in the previous section
raises the question of the sources of this change. In this section we address this
point by regressing the average value of the GCT score in each year against a
variety of variables observed at an annual frequency.25
The basic framework for our analysis is one that draws on the institutional
features discussed in Section II. In particular, in the period under study, officer
candidates must have completed a four-year college degree and, to have progressed
to the point to attend The Basic School and take the GCT, the candidates must also
have completed Officer Candidate School. As mentioned above, attrition from
Officer Candidate School is typically due to physical limitations or failures to
display leadership, not due to a lack of intellectual ability that would be reflected in
the GCT. While there has been much written about the effect of military
demographics and the GI Bill on college participation,26 college participation also
might have an impact on military demographics. The key point is that the pool of
those attending and completing college has increased dramatically over time,
increasing the pool of potential officer candidates. If the expansion of this pool over
time is biased towards increasing those who were less well-suited for higher
education, then the average intellectual ability of college graduates will decrease
over time. This will be reflected in a decrease in the average GCT score over time if

Ideally, we would have liked to have used information on individuals in order to use a panel data set but, as
mentioned above, privacy concerns meant that we only had individual-level GCT scores in each year rather than
these scores along with any individual-level characteristics.
26 For example, see Bound and Turner (2002).
25

14

there is not a preliminary selection by the Marines towards those with higher
intellectual abilities; as we have discussed, OCS does not primarily select or retain
based on intellectual ability.
To illustrate this point, we begin with a highly stylized model. For simplicity,
consider a situation where the range of intelligence of potential college students
follows a uniform distribution bounded by the values L and U. Suppose that the
most intelligent potential students go to college but, over time, the college
population expands.27 If the lower bound of those going to college is LC > L, then
the mean intelligence of college students is (U + LC)/2 and the proportion of those
going to college is (U – LC)/(U – L). If there is an increase in the proportion of
college attendees to (U – LC′)/(U – L) where L < LC′ < LC, then the average
intelligence of college attendees decreases to (U + LC′)/2 which is less than (U +
LC)/2. If the pool of those wanting to become Marine officers is representative of the
pool of college attendees, and if there is a positive, monotonic relationship between
intelligence and GCT scores, then the expansion of the pool of college students will
be associated with lower average GCT scores.28
In an effort to test the basic message of this framework, we first investigate
the potential link between college participation and the GCT scores by estimating
the regression
27

By some calculations, around 85% of the Americans in the upper quartile of intelligence went to college by
1980. See Herrnstein and Murray (1994), p. 34.
28 It is straightforward to extend this framework along several dimensions, for example, by allowing for a
change in the upper bound as well or for allowing some type of selection into the pool of potential officers that is
not completely neutral with respect to the size of the pool. With reasonable assumptions, these modifications
would not alter the main conclusion on the link between the size of the pool of college attendees and the average
GCT score.

The first column of Table 4 presents the estimate of Regression (1). The
coefficient on college participation is negative and significant at better than the 99
percent level of confidence. The goodness of fit is also very large, with an R²
statistic of 0.92. Figure 3 illustrates these results, plotting the observations and the
regression line. We calculate the quantitative relevance of this estimated effect by
considering the proportion of the change in the GCT explained by the rise in the
college participation rate. The estimated cumulative change in the college
participation variable over the 35 years is 52 percent. The estimated effect of
college participation on the GCT is the product of this number and

. The

estimated effect of an increasing college participation rate is 96 percent of the
actual percentage change in the GCT over this period.

29 The proportion of young people who have completed college, rather than those attending college, would be a
preferable regressor, but these data are not available.
30
According to the College Board, the mean SAT scores for college bound high school students has remained
relatively constant since 1980, even after adjusting the scores for score recenterings. There is some debate on
this point, especially after the 1995 recentering. See for example ‘Educational Reform: 1994-1995’, Educational
Excellence Network, 1995. The result presented in our paper would also be in line with a large meta-analysis of
IQ tests in North America, which suggested that IQ declined when controlling for education during the time
period studied. See Uttl and Van Alstine (2003).

The other columns of Table 4 show the robustness of the effect of college
participation rates on the annual average GCT scores while controlling for other
factors. Column II presents a regression that includes labor market factors. The
relative pay of young military officers to that of civilians of similar educational
attainment and age is expected to have a positive coefficient, since higher pay
makes a military career more attractive to those who might otherwise chose a
civilian path. We do find that there is a statistically significant effect of this
variable on the annual average GCT score at the 90 percent level of confidence. The
other two variables in this regression measure broad labor market conditions, the
unemployment rate for those aged 25 to 29 and the labor market participation rate
18

for this age group.31 The expected sign of the coefficient on the unemployment rate
is negative if a weaker civilian labor market makes a military career more
attractive to college graduates who cannot otherwise find a job. The participation
rate is included to control for the possibility that, say, a decrease in the
unemployment rate is just reflecting a decrease in labor market participation. The
coefficient on the participation rate would be negative if a higher participation rate
indicates a more vibrant civilian job market and a more limited pool of potential
military officers. But the coefficients on these two variables are not significant in
the estimates presented in this table.
The estimates presented in Columns III through V of Table 4 show the
robustness of the effect of the college variable to the inclusion of other factors that
might be suggested as potential contributors to the decline in the GCT scores over
time. Column III presents a regression in which the logarithm of the number of
incoming officers is included; the argument is that a larger number of incoming
officers means a weaker pool. As shown by the results in this column, however,
there is no evidence of this effect. The estimates in Column IV consider the
hypothesis that an aversion to the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan led to lower
GCT scores because of the effect of this war weariness on the pool of applicants
similar to how it made recruiting high-quality enlisted personnel more difficult.32
Again, there is no empirical support for this proposition. Finally, in Column V we
Previous analyses of recruiting high-quality enlisted have focused on number of potential recruits, number of
recruiters, unemployment, and the ratio of Civilian/Military Pay. See Murray, Michael, and Laurie McDonald.

include all regressors. In this estimate, as well as in all others presented in this
table, there is little change in the value or the statistical significance of the
coefficient on college participation, suggesting that the change in college
participation over this period is not serving as a proxy for any of these other factors.
We conclude this section by considering whether changing demographics of
the pool of incoming officers has contributed to the downward trend in the GCT
scores. Figure 4 presents the proportion of incoming officers who are African
American, Hispanic, and Female over the period 1980 to 2011, with the respective
estimated trend lines and, corresponding to an inverted scale on the right axis, the
trend line for the GCT scores (the axes are presented as a logarithmic scale). This
figure shows that there has not been a significant increase in the diversity of
incoming officers with respect to the proportion of African American incoming
officers over the 1980 – 2011 period. But there has been a statistically significant
trend in the proportion of incoming officers who are female and who are Hispanic.
The proportion of incoming officers who were women almost doubled from about 4.9
percent in 1980 to 9.5 percent in 2012, with a statistically significant estimated
annual average increase of 3.1 percent. The proportion of incoming officers who are
Hispanic was less that 0.6 percent in 1980, and this rose to 6.4 percent in 2011,
representing a statistically significant estimated growth rate of 6.0 percent.33

33

This estimated rate of growth for Hispanic incoming officers is heavily influenced by the especially low values
of incoming Hispanic officers in 1980, 1981 and 1982. The proportion of incoming Hispanic officers jumped from
0.7 percent in 1982 to 2.7 percent in 1983. Accordingly, the estimated growth rate from 1983 to 2011 is 3.4
percent, which is still statistically significant, but which is also only a little more than half as large as the
estimated growth rate if the first three years of the sample are included.

One way to test for the effect of increasing diversity on the average GCT
scores is to simply augment the regression specification (1) with the logarithm of
the proportion of incoming officers who are women, African American, or Hispanic
(we estimate separate regressions for gender and for race and ethnicity because we
do not have information by gender-race or gender-ethnicity groups and therefore
there is overlap between the category of females and the categories of African
American and Hispanic). If, in fact, the increasing diversity of the pool of incoming
officers is contributing to the decline in GCT scores, then we would expect to find a
negative and significant coefficient on these variables.
The estimates in Column I of Table 5 shows that there is not a significant
relationship linking the higher proportion of women incoming officers to lower GCT
21

scores; in fact, if anything, a higher proportion of incoming women officers is
associated with a higher average GCT score (although this result is not significant
at standard confidence levels since the p-value is 0.16). The college participation
rate variable is still highly significant and little changed from the estimates
presented in Table 4. The estimates in Column II show that the results of the
effects of the proportion of women in the incoming class of officers, and the
estimated contributions of women to the change in the average GCT scores over
time, are little altered by the inclusion of labor market regressors used in Table 4.
What is the magnitude of these effects? In the lower part of the table, we
present the overall percentage change in the GCT over the sample period as well as
the amount attributable to the factors included in the regression and the proportion
of the overall change attributable to each of these factors.34 These statistics show
that, in the estimates presented in Columns I and II, the actual change in the GCT
is about the same as the change attributed to the increase in the college
participation rate. The estimated change due to the changing proportion of female
incoming officers is actually positive, rather than negative.
Columns III and IV present this type of analysis for the proportion of
incoming officers who are African-American and Hispanic. These estimates show
that, as with the number of incoming female officers, there is a positive relationship
between the number of incoming African-American officers and the average GCT
34

As in the discussion of the contribution of the increased size of the college pool to the overall change in the
GCT based on the estimates in Column I of Table 4, the percentage change attributable to each variable is
calculated as the product of the change in that variable over the sample period and the respective estimated
coefficient. The proportion of the overall change is this value divided by the percentage change in the GCT over
the sample period.

22

score and, unlike the case with incoming female officers, this estimated effect is
statistically significant (at better than the 99 percent level of confidence).
Conversely, the estimated effect of the proportion of incoming Hispanic officers and
the average GCT score is negative and statistically significant.35 The lower panel
shows that two-thirds of the change in the GCT score is still attributable to the
increased size of the pool of college students. The estimated change in the GCT
score due to the changing proportion of incoming African-American officers is
positive, not negative. In contrast, there is a relatively substantial estimated effect
attributable to the increased proportion of Hispanic officers; in the estimates in
Column III, this is -1.8% (representing 29% of the total change in GCT scores over
this period) and in Column IV it is -1.4% (representing 22% of the change in GCT
scores). In the estimates in Column IV, however, the estimated coefficient on the
proportion of incoming Hispanic officers is not significant, while that on the college
participation rate and the proportion of incoming African-American officers remain
significant.

35

Figure 4 shows that the growth rate of incoming Hispanic officers is heavily influenced by the low values in
1980, 1981, and 1982. In order to consider the sensitivity of the results in Column III to the inclusion of these
three observations, we re-estimate this regression for the period 1983 to 2011. In a regression with same
specification as in Column II, the coefficient on the logarithm of incoming Hispanic Officers is 0.0086 and its
standard error is 0.0053, with a p-value of 0.12.

The relatively large and significant estimated contribution of incoming
Hispanic officers to the decline in GCT scores in Column III raises the question of
the source of this effect. One possibility is that the main mechanism we consider,
the increasing proportion of college students, is especially pronounced for Hispanics;
over the sample period, the average annual increase in the college participation rate
for Hispanics was 4.1 percent, as compared to 1.7 percent for the non-Hispanic
population. We investigate this possibility by first defining the geometric average of
the GCT score in any year as
(2)
where

is the average GCT score for Hispanics in year t,

GCT score for non-Hispanics in that year, and

is the average

is the proportion of incoming

officers who are Hispanics in year t. It is worth noting, at this point, that the
proportion of incoming officers who were Hispanic varied quite a bit over the sample
period, rising from 0.6% in 1980 to a peak of 8.2% in 1999, and ending the sample
period at 6.4%.

Hispanics and non-Hispanics populations, and takes into account the changing
proportion of incoming officers who were Hispanic, is

We conclude this section by considering a model that nests both the
regression presented above, in which the contribution of incoming Hispanic officers
to the GCT is through the change in the proportion of incoming officers and the
proportion of Hispanics attending college, and a model in which there is some
Hispanic-specific effect on the GCT scores unrelated to these changing proportions.

Conclusion

Twenty percent of the United States federal budget goes towards funding the
American military36 and it is one of America’s most trusted institutions.37 Yet
despite the intense scrutiny of the intelligence of the enlisted force, there has been
little study of the intelligence of the officer corps. This paper analyzed the
intelligence of the officers of one branch of the military, the Marine Corps, and
found a relevant and steady decline in intelligence, as measured by GCT scores,
since 1980. This decline was closely associated with an expansion of the pool of
young college graduates during the same time period, which potentially diminished
the overall intellectual quality of that pool.
Our results also support those who argue that affirmative action has not had
a negative impact on the quality of the officer corps. The Marine Corps has, since
the 1990s, actively recruited African American officers, and there has been some
debate on whether this is harmful to overall officer quality.38 A similar debate has
played out recently about the recruitment of women. We find, in fact, a positive
association between African American officers and mean GCT score, perhaps
because recruitment efforts by the Marine Corps have attracted minority officers
who are more qualified than the typical college graduate. There is no evidence that
a greater proportion of incoming Hispanic officers reduces the annual average GCT
scores for any reasons other than those identified for the non-Hispanic group and

29

furthermore, given the small proportion of incoming Hispanic officers, this effect
has no meaningful quantitative contribution to the change in GCT scores over time.
Overall, then, this study rebuts the often tacit assumption that minority officers are
less qualified than their counterparts.
What has been the impact of this drop in intelligence on the effectiveness of
the military? Answering this question is beyond the scope of this paper. Given the
myriad studies associating performance with intellect, however, it is hard to
imagine anything other than a seriously deleterious impact on the quality of officers
and, by extension, on the quality and efficacy of the military.

o Data is sorted by fiscal year, instead of calendar year
o Comparing the number of valid scores we received with the number of
Marine Officers who were commissioned in each year according to the
annual Personnel Readiness Reviews, it appears that we received the
scores of around 90% of the officers.
o Erroneous scores of 0 were deleted
o Those scores below 80 were deleted as unlikely
o 96 members of the third TBS class of 2004 was assigned a score of 100,
which must be erroneous; in 2003, for example, only 3 officers received
a 100 out of the entire year. It would appear that the scores of two
platoons in the third TBS class of 2004 were lost and a default value of
100 was entered. All values of 100 from the third TBS class of 2004
were therefore deleted. If anything, this means that we are missing a
few officers who really did score 100 in that year.
o While all values from 2014 were received, there were only 272 values
reported in 2013 (corresponding to one class of TBS). According to the
Marine Corps Times, over 1400 Marine officers joined that year, a
normal amount. We are therefore missing over a thousand scores from
that year, making it suspect.
