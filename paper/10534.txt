ABSTRACT
This paper characterizes the precautionary demand for international reserves driven by the attempt
to reduce the incidence of costly output decline induced by sudden reversal of short-term capital
flows. It validates the main predictions of the precautionary approach by investigating changes in
the patterns of international reserves in Korea in the aftermath of the 1997-8 crisis. This crisis
provides an interesting case study, especially because of the rapid rise in Korea's financial
integration in the aftermath of the East-Asian crisis, where foreigners' shareholding has increased
to 40% of total Korean market capitalization. We show that the crisis led to structural change in the
hoarding of international reserves, and that the Korean monetary authority gives much greater
attention to a broader notion of 'hot money,' inclusive of short-term debt and foreigners'
shareholding.

1. Introduction
The 1997-8 East Asian crisis has led to a rethinking of policy design in developing
countries. Several countries in East Asia have reacted by more active management of
international reserves and external debt positions, and a large build up of international liquidity.
These changes were triggered by the recognition that even the “Asian Tigers” were not immune
to sudden stops of short-term capital flows.1 Countries averse to the costs of sudden stops of
capital flows would tend to manage precautionary savings, in the form of international reserves.
These reserves may provide a line of defense against sudden stops of capital flows. Another
intriguing adjustment of several countries (including Korea) has been growing financial
openness coupled with greater flexibility of the exchange rate. Figure 1 provides a vivid
illustration of the remarkable opening of the Korean equity market in the aftermath of the 1997
crisis, increasing foreigners’ equity position as a percentage of Korean GDP from close to 2%
prior to the crisis to about 23 % within six years! The greater flexibility of the exchange rate
may provide a line of defense against sudden stops of capital flows. However, the large share of
foreign ownership of Korean stocks implies now that a sudden capital flow reversal exposes
Korea to the risk of sharp real exchange depreciation coupled with the collapse of the Korean
stock market. In these circumstances, precautionary management of international reserves may
mitigate these risks. Such observations are consistent with Figures 1-2: in the aftermath of the
crisis, the international reserves/GDP ratio increased sizably, reaching the ratio of the external
debt/GDP. Indeed, the increase in the international reserves/GDP ratio is positively correlated
with the foreigners’ equity position in Korea as a share of Korean GDP.
In this paper we provide theoretical and empirical interpretations for the build up and
active management of international reserves. In Section 2 we outline a model that may explain
the patterns observed in Figures 1-2. Specifically, we extend Aizenman and Marion (2004), to
account for the possibility that sudden stops may trigger large output costs, due to higher cost of
credit or banking crises. In these circumstances, international reserves may reduce the
probability of a full-blown liquidity crisis, thereby increasing welfare. We find that exposure to
sovereign risk and downside output risk associated with a costly debt crisis provides the rationale

short-term capital flows.

3
for precautionary savings and management of international reserves. The hoarding of reserves
associated with mitigating the expected output costs connected with sudden stops is shown to
depend positively on the expected output cost associated with the liquidity squeeze. The demand
for reserves also increases with the effectiveness of international reserves in mitigating the
probability of the crisis, and decreases with the opportunity costs of reserves.
In section 3 we present an overview of key developments associated with the patterns of
international reserves in Korea in recent years, and evaluate empirically the management of
international reserves by the Korean Central Bank. The evaluation is consistent with a structural
brake in the patterns of hoarding and managing international reserves. The timing of the brake is
the 1997-8 Korean sudden stop crisis, which was associated with a sharp drop in output, and
major policy adjustments in Korea. The aftermath of the crisis has also been associated with
rapid financial opening of Korea. As the Lucas Critique would suggest, we should expect that
these events would lead to profound changes in the econometric association of variables, and
structural brakes in the patterns of correlations among the various variables. We confirm this
prediction, finding significant structural changes in the patterns of international reserves in the
aftermath of the 1997-8 crisis. The shortness of the sample suggests that one should not expect
stable results that would be robust across possible specifications, as indeed we find in our
empirical results. Yet, the data are consistent with the patterns depicted in Figure 2 --- the 19978 crisis has led to a structural increase in the demand for international reserves, linking the actual
level of IR with the exposure of liabilities to foreign creditors and equity holders.
Specifically, our investigation shows that, while trade openness was significant in
explaining international reserves before the crisis, it loses significance after the crisis. This is
consistent with the notion that the rapid integration of Korea with the global financial system
increases the weight of financial openness, and may reduce the weight of trade openness, in
accounting for the patterns of international reserves. We also find that export receipts volatility
was not significant before the crisis, but turns positive after the crisis. Higher foreigners’
shareholding is associated with higher hoarding of international reserves. Furthermore, this effect
gains statistical significance after the crisis. Of course, the large increase in the domestic
exposure to foreigners’ shareholding in Korea implies that it plays a much more important role in
accounting for the recent patterns of international reserves in the aftermath of the crisis.
Coefficients on short-term external debt were negative and not significant before the crisis, but

4
turn positive and significant after the crisis. This is consistent with the view that the crisis has
led to a drastic change in attitude towards short-term debt, and a new policy that attempts to
mitigate the exposure to hot money by increasing international reserves in tandem with short
term debt and foreigners’ shareholding in Korea. Volatility of the won/dollar exchange rate
becomes significant after the crisis and exhibits negative coefficients, which is consistent with
the theoretical prediction associated with allowing greater flexibility of the exchange rate.
Section 4 closes the paper with discussion of the main finding and possible extensions.

2. On the precautionary demand for international reserves
The demand for international reserves stems from several sources. The earlier literature
focused on using international reserves as part of the management of an adjustable peg or
managed floating exchange rate regime [Frenkel (1983), Edwards (1983); see Flood and Marion
(2001) for a literature review]. The recent financial crises afflicting countries with limited access
to international borrowing, suggest another aspect of international reserves – namely, they serve
as an asset affecting the developing country’s exposure to sovereign risk and costly adjustment.
These considerations suggest that international reserves may be viewed as a form of
precautionary saving for economies with conditional access to global capital markets and costly
domestic tax collection. Formally, both costly taxation, and imperfect integration with the global
capital market due to sovereign risk generate nonlinearities that make precautionary balances
welfare-improving. Aizenman and Marion (2004) examine the contribution of reserves and
external debt to tax smoothing for the case where future productivity is random, showing the
welfare gain associated with hoarding a potentially large stockpile of international reserves. It is
noteworthy that sizable precautionary demand for international reserves exists even if agents are
risk-neutral: the nonlinearities associated with costly taxation and sovereign risk suffices to
induce a first order demand for reserves, independent of risk aversion.
In this section we extend the above argument to account for the possibility that sudden
stops of short-term capital flows may trigger large output costs, due to higher cost of credit or
banking crises. In these circumstances, international reserves may reduce the probability of a
full-blown liquidity crisis, thereby increasing welfare. We outline below a simple model to
account for this possibility. The model is designed to capture an important feature of recent

5
crises: time consuming and costly debt renegotiation. Even when the resolution of the debt crisis
is reasonably fast, partial default and debt restructuring frequently leads to further short run
declines in output, as was highlighted by Ben-Bassat and Gottlieb (1992). Unlike Aizenman and
Marion (2004), where the distribution of output is independent of the default decisions, in this
section we focus on the case where the default decision impacts the distribution of output, raising
the possibility of costly recessions. To simplify the discussion, we strip fiscal considerations
from the problem, and identify the precautionary demand for international reserves that is
independent of the inefficiencies associated with costly taxes.
We study a two-period emerging-market economy where second period output, Y2 , is
subject to productivity shocks. The country can borrow internationally in the first period, but
because there is some chance it will default in the second period, it faces a credit ceiling. The
central bank actively targets the stock of reserves. Even so, a variety of exchange-rate
arrangements are possible, such as a fixed exchange rate or a managed float, because the balance
sheets of the central bank and treasury are consolidated. The emerging market borrows B in
period 1 at a contractual rate r and owes (1+ r)B in period 2. If it faces a bad enough
productivity shock in the second period, it defaults. Default, however, is not without penalty.
International creditors can confiscate some of the emerging market’s export revenues or other
resources equal to a share α of its output. The more open the economy, the greater α is likely to

be. We assume that the defaulting country’s international reserve holdings are beyond the reach
of creditors.2
In the second period, the country repays its international obligations if repayment,
[ (1 + r) B ], is less costly than the expected default penalty, assuming to be a fraction α of the
expected output, αE[Y2 ] . The country ends up transferring S2 real resources to international
creditors in the second period, where:

(1)
2

S 2 = MIN [ (1 + r ) B; α Y2 ] ,

0 < α < 1.

This is a realistic assumption. For example, on January 5, 2002, The Economist reported
“[President Duhalde] confirmed that Argentina will formally default on its debt, an overdue
admission of an inescapable reality. The government has not had access to international credit
(except from the IMF) since July. It had already repatriated nearly all of its liquid foreign assets
to avoid their seizure by creditors.” (The Economist, p. 29)

6

To simplify, we focus on a two states of nature example, where the second period
exogenous productivity shock is either high ( δ ), or low ( −δ ). We assume that all agents are
risk neutral. High enough external debt would lead to partial default in the bad state of nature.
With probability p, the default would lead to a liquidity crunch or banking crisis, inducing a
further drop of output at rate ε, from low level ( 1 − δ ), to very low level [ (1 − δ )(1 − ε ) ]. The
sequence of events is the following:
In the first period the country borrows externally B , and hoards international reserves

shock, δ or - δ, is realized.
III.

Next, the decision maker moves, deciding whether to default or to repay fully.

IV.

A partial default decision would have further repercussions: with probability p, it
would magnify the output drop, reducing output from 1 − δ to (1 − δ )(1 − ε ) .

The reduced form of the GDP in period i (i = 1, 2) is:

The time line stages III and IV are pointed out above the corresponding arrows.

Suppose the risk-free interest rate is rf . The interest rate attached to the country’s
acquired debt, r , is determined by the condition that the expected return on the debt is equal to
the risk-free return:

(3)

E[S2 ] = (1+ rf )B

Applying the above assumptions, for debt level B and interest rate r, partial default would
take place in the bad state of nature (at stage III of the time line stated above) if it raises the

7
expected consumption: 1 − δ − B(1 + r ) < (1 − p)(1 − α )(1 − δ ) + p(1 − α )(1 − ε )(1 − δ ) , which is
equivalent to (1 − δ )[α + pε (1 − α )] < B (1 + r ) .3 Consequently, for

α (1 + δ ) > B(1 + r ) > (1 − δ )[α + pε (1 − α )] , the expected debt service is

(4)

E[ S 2 ] = 0.5[(1 + r ) B + (1 − p )α (1 − δ ) + pα (1 − δ )(1 − ε )] .

The credit ceiling facing the economy, B , is the discounted expected repayment when the debt
is large enough to induce partial default in all states of nature (discounting by the risk free
interest rate, rf ):

For exposition simplicity, we assume no independent fiscal objectives for the government, and
zero initial debt and stock of reserves. In a two-period model, there is no need to hold reserves
beyond the second period. Thus the terminal demand for reserves is zero. Consequently,
for α (1 + δ ) > B(1 + r ) > (1 − δ )[α + pε (1 − α )] , the budget constraints facing the representative
agents are:4

Partial default in the bad state of nature [following the output shock −δ ] changes the second
period expected consumption cost of external debt form B (1 + r ) to (1 − δ )[α + pε (1 − α )] . The
term (1 − δ )[α + pε (1 − α )] is the sum of the expected repayment to creditors [equals a fraction α
of the expected output, α (1 − δ )(1 − pε ) ], plus the expected consumption loss associated with the
adverse output effect of partial default [ (1 − δ ) pε ]. The first is a transfer to creditors, the second
is the deadweight loss associated with partial default. Note also that
for (1 − δ )[α + pε (1 − α )] > B(1 + r ) , the country is better off repaying the contractual debt.

We assume lump sum taxes and transfers, and that the net income of the consolidated central

Partial default on external debt may lead to further liquidity squeezes, as would be the
case if it would induce some lenders to liquidate their portfolio, or if it would make it harder to
obtain trade credit, etc. We summarize the output effects of the liquidity squeeze in a reduced
form, postulating that the probability p increases with the partial default in state l/international
reserve ratio. The resultant partial default, denoted by Λ l , is the gap between the contractual
repayment and the actual planned repayment in state l: Λ l = B(1 + r ) − α (1 − δ ) . Consequently,
the probability that the partial default would trigger further output collapse is:

9
Equation (8) is in line with Edwards (2004), finding that current account reversals associated
with sudden stops have a negative effect on real growth that goes beyond their direct effect on
investment, and that the probability of a country experiencing a current account reversal depends
negatively on international reserves. It can be viewed as a reduced form of a more complex, three
period model, akin to Diamond and Dybvig’s (1983) liquidity model, where in the second
period, a random fraction of foreign lenders attempts to liquidate their loan.
The optimal borrowing and reserve accumulation is obtained by maximizing the expected
utility (7), subject to (6) and (8). It is easy to verify that borrowing would increase with the
subjective discount rate, ρ. For exposition simplicity, let us assume that the subjective discount
rate is high enough to push the borrowing to the credit ceiling, B = B , given by (5). This
reduces the complexity of the problem, allowing us to focus on a single first order condition
characterizing the optimal international reserve level corresponding to B = B . Applying (6) to

associated with the interest income, (1 + r f ) . The second term evaluates the gains associated

Our analysis can be extended in several ways. It can be verified that similar results apply
for an internal equilibrium, where borrowing is below the credit ceiling. To simplify, we
assumed that ε, the size of the endogenous output distress, is exogenously given. The analysis
can be readily extended by allowing both p and ε to depend positively on our financial distress
measure (i.e., on the partial default/international liquidity ratio).
Evaluation of the patterns of output in Korea (see Figures 6-7), as well the results
reported in Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) and Hutchison and Noy (2002) are consistent with the
notion that sudden stops are associated with large output losses. Hence, the 1997-8 crisis
concentrated the minds of policy makers and economists on the potential hazards associated with
exposure to sudden stops, and the potential benefits of hoarding international reserves. Figure 8
reveals that the opportunity cost of hoarding international reserves has decreased significantly in
the aftermath of the crisis. These factual developments imply a sizable increase in the
precautionary demand for international reserves by Korea. We turn now to a more formal
econometric assessment of these issues.

12
3. Management of International Reserves: Korea
In this Section we evaluate empirically the management of international reserves by the
Korean monetary authority. We first illustrate what factors are behind the large accumulation of
international reserves in the aftermath of the crisis by taking a look at the evolution of
international reserves and other related macroeconomic variables.
International reserves were 9 billion dollars (in terms of usable amount) at the end of
1997, but rapidly built up to 155 billion dollars by the end of 2003. As a fraction of GDP,
international reserves rose from 3% to 30% over the same period. A swift glance at the data
indicates that a large current account surplus, coupled with continued inflows of foreigners’
equity investment, played an important role in the rapid accumulation of international reserves.
Over the period 1998-2003, the cumulative current account surplus reached 103 billion dollars,
and net portfolio inflows accumulated up to 56 billion dollars, among which 54 billion dollars
were in the form of equity inflows (see Figure 3). Foreigners were allowed to directly purchase
up to 10 % of the outstanding shares of a company in total, effective January 3, 1992. The total
ceiling was gradually raised to 26%, 50%, and 55% on November 3, December 11, and
December 30, 1997 respectively. The ceiling was finally lifted completely on May 25, 1998. In
response to these liberalization policies, foreigners’ shareholding as a percentage of the total
market capitalization has risen from 12% at the end of 1997, to 40% by the end of 2003 (see
Figure 4).
In order to assess the responsiveness of international reserves to those factors noted
above, we run reduced-form regressions. These regressions relate change in international
reserves to current account and net equity, debt, and other investment inflows in the balance of
payments; and to changes in foreigners’ equity position and short-term external debt.
Table 1(a) shows that current account and equity inflows are significant at the 1% level in
the post-crisis period. Specifically, a 1 dollar increase in the current account surplus led to a 0.75
dollar increase in international reserves. Further, after the crisis, a 1 dollar increase in equity
inflows led to a 0.64 dollar increase in international reserves. This finding confirms our prior
conjecture that large current account surplus and equity inflows are the main driving forces
behind the post-crisis build-up of international reserves.
It is noteworthy that the 1997 crisis increased significantly the responsiveness of the
international reserves position to external debts. In Table 1(a) the coefficient on debt inflows

13
was negative in the pre-crisis period, though not significant. However, it changes sign and gains
significance at the 10% level in the post-crisis period, suggesting that debt inflows of 1 dollar led
to an increase in international reserves by 0.5 dollar. The results in Table 1(b) are consistent
with this finding. For example, in Table 1(b), a 1% point increase in short-term debt/GDP ratio
led to an increase of international reserves/GDP ratio by about 0.4% point before the crisis, and
about 1.2% point after the crisis.
One lesson to draw from the financial crisis is that the monetary authority should take
into careful consideration capital flows, and relate the level of international reserves to shortterm external debt [for example, see Greenspan (1999) and Wijnholds and Kapteyn (2001)].7 In
Korea, the short-term external debt/GDP ratio reached 20% at the end of 1997, fell to 11% at the
end of 1998, and thereafter has remained stable around 10% (see Figure 2). Throughout the precrisis period, the international reserves/GDP ratio fell short of the ratio of short-term external
debt to GDP. However, it outpaced the short-term debt/GDP ratio in 1998:3Q for the first time,
and thereafter continued to rise well above the short-term debt ratio. Throughout this period,
foreigners’ equity position/GDP ratio was 2% at the end of 1997, but sharply increased to 23%
by the end of 2003. This suggests that the large accumulation of international reserves may be
related to the sharp increase in foreigners’ shareholding. It is noteworthy that the ratio of
international reserves to GDP tends to converge to the (short-term debt + foreigners’
shareholding)/GDP ratio (see Figure 5).8 This fact suggests that in the aftermath of the 1997-8

Asia based on the behavior of different types of capital flows during currency crises.

The Korean monetary authority unofficially maintains the view that international reserves
should be enough to cover short-term external debt plus some portion of foreigners’
shareholdings:
“Kim Woong-bae, director general of the central Bank of Korea (BOK), made clear that the
Korean government would retain the current dollar stockpiles for the time being. “I don’t
think the ample reserves will put pressures on monetary policy, including inflation, as the
global economy is in a low-inflation era,” he said. Most of all, Korea needs to gear up for a
sudden outflow of so-called hot money, he added. An estimate put the amount of speculative
capital in the country’s stock and bond markets at $500 billion (Korea Times,
http://times.hankooki.com, October 23, 2003).”

14
crisis, the Korean monetary authority gives much greater attention to a broader notion of hot
money, inclusive of foreigners’ shareholding, rather than to short-term debt alone.9
Using structural models, we now formally investigate whether equity inflows and shortterm external debt have played a significant role in the rapid accumulation of international
reserves in the post-crisis period. For this purpose, we start with a benchmark Regression (1)
that adds foreigners’ equity position/GDP ratio and short-term external debt/GDP ratio to the
traditional determinants of the demand for international reserves such as scale factor, trade
openness, and volatility of exports:

(11)

ln(IR/GDP)t = a0 + a1 ln(RGDP) t + a2 ln(API) t + a3 ln(SDEX) t +
a4 ln(FEP/GDP) t + a5 ln(SED/GDP) t,

where IR is international reserves, RGDP is real GDP, API is the share of imports of goods and
services in GDP, SDEX is the volatility of export receipts, FEP is foreigners’ shareholding, and
SED is short-term external debt.10
Regressions (2) – (5) in Table 2 add, respectively, contemporaneous and lagged current
account (CA), log of the deviation of the real effective exchange rate from its equilibrium value
(LDEVREER), and log of the volatility of the won/dollar exchange rate (LSDWON), to the
explanatory variables employed in Regression (1). In Regressions (6) and (7) all explanatory
variables are included, the former with contemporaneous current account and the latter with
lagged current account.
These specifications are adopted to allow for the possible effects of structural changes in
Korean economy on international reserves that developed in the aftermath of the 1997 crisis.
The current account is added to capture the policy response to changes in the status of Korea’s
current account. Over the period 1990-1997, Korea recorded current account deficits that

account deficit turned into a surplus and remains in surplus to the present day. Over the period
1998-2003, Korea accumulated a current account surplus of 103 billion dollars. When the
current account is in surplus, a central bank is inclined to purchase foreign exchanges to mitigate
appreciation pressure on the national currency.
Asian countries are often blamed for manipulating their exchange rates to maintain
international competitiveness. The Korean monetary authority may have intervened in the
foreign exchange market to prevent real appreciation of the won. To explore this possibility we
consider the deviation of the real effective exchange rate from its equilibrium.
As of December 16, 1997, Korea has adopted a floating exchange rate regime and allows
the won to float. Theoretically, a free-floating exchange rate regime reduces the demand for
international reserves, but practically it may increase the demand because of ‘fear of floating’.
The monetary authority may need more international reserves to stabilize the exchange rate in
the face of rapidly growing foreign exchange transactions and increasingly volatile exchange
rate. In order to empirically assess the relative importance of the two conflicting effects, we
include the volatility of the won/dollar exchange rate.
Table 2 presents regression results, both for the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. The
data set begins from 1992:1Q, when direct purchases of the Korean stocks were first allowed to
foreigners, and ends in 2003:4Q. We split the whole sample into two subsets: 1992:1Q1997:2Q and 1998:3Q-2003:4Q in order to investigate whether there are significant structural
changes in the patterns of international reserves after the 1997 crisis. The time spans before and
after the crisis are well balanced, each period covering 5 years and 2 quarters. We exclude
1997:3Q-1998:2Q from the estimation, during which Korean financial markets were
experiencing extraordinary turbulence due to the ongoing Asian financial crisis.
As shown in Regression (1), real GDP does not appear to play any important role, both
before and after the crisis. It is statistically significant only in Regression (4) in the post-crisis
period, but not significant in all other cases.11 Trade openness was significant before the crisis,
but loses its significance after the crisis in Regression (1).

The same result obtains in

Regressions (3) and (4). The volatility of export receipts was not significant before the crisis, but

This result is not surprising, considering that the dependent variable is already deflated by
GDP. Dropping real GDP from the explanatory variables does not alter the major results of the

becomes significant after the crisis in Regressions (1), (2), (3), and (4). These findings suggest
that Korea is more concerned about the uncertainty than the magnitude of export receipts in the
post-crisis period, during which current account is in continued surplus.
The result, that foreigners’ shareholding leads to an increase in international reserves, is
more significant in the post-crisis period. The ratio of foreigners’ shareholding to GDP is
significant both before and after the crisis in Regressions (1), (2), and (4). On the other hand, in
Regressions (5) – (7) foreigners’ equity position is not significant before the crisis, but becomes
statistically significant after the crisis.
An interesting finding is that prior to the crisis the coefficient on short-term external debt
is negative, though not significant in most cases, but after the crisis it turns to a positive value
and becomes significant. The results are robust across all the other Regressions (2) – (7). This
finding indicates that short term external debt was considered a substitute for international
reserves before the crisis. International transactions can be financed by external debt, thereby
reducing the demand for international reserves (Eaton and Gersovitz, 1980). The 1997 financial
crisis, however, has dramatically changed the attitude towards short-term debt, as indicated by
the Korean government’s attempts to mitigate the exposure to hot money by changing
international reserves in tandem with short term debt.

This is consistent with the notion

elaborated in the previous section: the crisis has led to a large increase in precautionary demand
for international reserves.
The current account, either contemporaneous or lagged, does not exhibit any significant
effect on international reserves in both periods. The signs of its coefficient differ, depending on
model specifications (specifically, contemporaneous or lagged). As discussed above, a current
account surplus tends to increase international reserves via foreign exchange market bank
intervention on the supply side, but at the same time it may decrease the demand for international
reserves by reducing the perceived vulnerability of a country to external shocks.
Exchange rate deviation from its equilibrium value is significant in Regression (4), both
before and after the crisis. It has a positive coefficient before the crisis, implying that
overvaluation of the won led to an increase in international reserves. This may be due to
purchases of foreign exchanges by the central bank in an effort to prevent appreciation of the

paper, and in most regressions increases the level of statistical significance of foreigners equity
position and short-term debt in the post-crisis period.

won. After the crisis, however, its sign becomes negative as shown in Regression (4). Note that
in the post-crisis period the exchange rate deviation is also significant at the 5% level in
regression (6), where current account and the volatility of exchange rate are included, but its sign
is still negative.12
This puzzling result may be due to the lack of a reliable measure of the equilibrium
exchange rate or change in exchange rate policies after the crisis. Korea introduced inflation
targeting in 1998, devoting more attention to stabilizing the price level than to preventing real
appreciation of the won. Appreciation of the won contributes much to a fall in the inflation rate
by lowering the costs of imported materials and final goods. The Korean monetary authority,
therefore, has less incentive to prevent appreciation of the won under inflation targeting.
Consistent with the theoretical prediction, in the aftermath of the crisis, the exchange rate
volatility coefficient is negative and becomes significant at the 1% level in Regressions (5) and
(7) under the flexible exchange rate regime.

4. Concluding remarks
One interpretation of the recent hoarding of international reserves by East Asian countries
is as a result of precautionary demands. Our discussion suggests that the precautionary demand
depends positively on the ability of international reserves to mitigate the probability of output
collapse induced by sovereign partial default, and the ability of international reserves to alleviate
shortages of fiscal resources in bad states of nature. While the data reviewed in Section 3 is
consistent with this interpretation, we do not argue that the present level of international reserves
observed in East Asia is optimal. Some of the demand for international reserves is driven by
factors beyond the scope of this paper. These may include reserve accumulation triggered by
concerns about export competitiveness, an explanation advanced recently by Dooley, FolkertsLandau and Garber (2003). Short of having better data and more detailed econometric
investigations, the precautionary motive and the mercantilist interpretations for hoarding
international reserves may be observationally equivalent. Yet, the two interpretations are
associated with different welfare effects. Another difference between the two approaches is that
12

This finding, together with the lack of statistical significance of the current account coefficient,
is in contrast with the popular view that Asian countries manage exchange rates to preserve

18
the precautionary demand identifies an “optimal” stock of international reserves, whereas the
Dooley at al. (2003) approach views the level of international reserves as a residual, and does not
attempt to identify its optimal size. Testing and identifying the differential impact of
precautionary versus mercantilist motives on international reserves remains a task for future
research.

export competitiveness. Of course, addressing this issue in depth requires not only accurate
measures of foreign exchange market intervention, but also more formal models.

Notes: Real cost of sterilization is [(1+i)-(1+i*)(1+x)]/(1+π), where i is Monetary Stabilization Bonds yield, i* is TBill rate, x is the depreciation rate of the won/dollar exchange rate, and π is the CPI inflation rate of Korea. Real
interest differentials are (i-π)-(i*-π*), where π* is the CPI inflation rate of the US.
Monetary Stabilization Bonds yield reflects the cost of sterilizing the accumulation of international reserves and a
large portion of international reserves has been invested in T-Bills. Monetary Stabilization Bonds are the central
bank’s interest-bearing bonds that are directly backed by printing money, unlike government bonds that are
primarily backed by legal taxation. The Korean monetary authority has actively sterilized a large current account
surplus and capital inflows by selling the Monetary Stabilization Bonds. In this sterilization process, the Bank of
Korea incurs the high quasi-fiscal cost associated with purchasing low-yielding foreign assets and selling highyielding Monetary Stabilization Bonds. See Seo (2002).
