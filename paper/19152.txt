Sequential Monte Carlo Sampling for DSGE Models
Edward P. Herbst and Frank Schorfheide
NBER Working Paper No. 19152
June 2013
JEL No. C11,C15,E10
ABSTRACT
We develop a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for estimating Bayesian dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium (DSGE) models, wherein a particle approximation to the posterior is built iteratively
through tempering the likelihood. Using three examples consisting of an artificial state-space model,
the Smets and Wouters (2007) model, and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe’s (2012) news shock model we
show that the SMC algorithm is better suited for multimodal and irregular posterior distributions than
the widely-used random walk Metropolis- Hastings algorithm. We find that a more diffuse prior for
the Smets and Wouters (2007) model improves its marginal data density and that a slight modification
of the prior for the news shock model leads to drastic changes in the posterior inference about the importance
of news shocks for fluctuations in hours worked. Unlike standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
techniques, the SMC algorithm is well suited for parallel computing.

Introduction

Bayesian methods are now widely used to estimate dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
models. Bayesian methods combine the likelihood function of a DSGE model with a prior distribution for its parameters to form a posterior distribution that can then be used for inference and
decision making. Because it is infeasible to compute moments of the posterior distribution analytically, simulation methods must be used to characterize the posterior. Starting with Schorfheide
(2000) and Otrok (2001), the random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) algorithm – an iterative
simulation technique belonging to the class of algorithms known as Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithms – has been the workhorse simulator for DSGE models. Herbst (2011) reports
that 95% of papers published from 2005 to 2010 in eight top economics journals use the RWMH
algorithm to implement Bayesian estimation of DSGE models.
While the complexity of DSGE models has increased over time, the efficacy of the RWMH
algorithm has declined. For instance, it is well documented, e.g., Chib and Ramamurthy (2010)
and Herbst (2011), that the sequences of DSGE model parameter draws generated by the RWMH
algorithm can be very slow to converge to the posterior distribution. This problem is not limited to
DSGE model applications; it is important for many areas of applied Bayesian research. Parameter
draws may exhibit high serial correlation such that averages of these draws converge very slowly
to moments of posterior distributions, or the algorithm may get stuck near local mode and fail to
explore the posterior distribution in its entirety (see, for instance, Neal (2003)).
In this paper we explore an alternative class of algorithms, namely, so-called sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) algorithms, to generate draws from posterior distributions associated with DSGE
models. SMC techniques are usually associated with solving intractable integration problems (such
as filtering nonlinear state space systems); however, they can be used to estimate static model
parameters – a point raised by Chopin (2002). The SMC method employed here amounts to
recursively constructing importance samplers for a sequence of distributions that begin at an easyto-sample initial distribution and end at the posterior, supplemented by a series of intermediate
“bridge” distributions. The draws from these distributions are called particles and each particle is
associated with an importance weight. The particles that represent bridge distribution n − 1 are
“mutated” into particles for bridge distribution n using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm.
The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we tailor a generic SMC algorithm to make
it suitable for the analysis of a large-scale DSGE model. More specifically, building on insights from

2
the application of RWMH algorithms to DSGE models, we use random blocking of parameters as
well as mixture proposal distributions during the MH mutation step of the algorithm. Without these
modification, the algorithm failed to explore the posterior surface of large scale DSGE models. We
also made the proposal distribution adaptive, that is, its mean and covariance matrix in iteration
n is a function of the particles generated in iteration n − 1. Second, we present a strong law of
large numbers (SLLN) and a central limit theorem (CLT) for the specific version of our algorithm.
In particular, we show that, under some regularity conditions, the adaptive determination of the
proposal distribution in the mutation step of our algorithm does not affect the limit distribution of
the SMC approximation of posterior moments.
Third, we provide two empirical illustrations involving large scale DSGE models, namely the
widely used Smets and Wouters (2007) model (hereafter SW model) and a DSGE model with anticipated (news) shocks developed by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2012) (hereafter SGU model). We
find that the SMC algorithm is more stable than the RWMH algorithm if applied repeatedly to generate draws from the same posterior distribution, providing a better approximation of multimodal
posterior distributions, in particular. We estimate the SW model under the prior used by Smets
and Wouters (2007) as well as a more diffuse prior. While the fit of the model, measured by the
marginal data density, substantially improves under the diffuse prior, the posterior surface becomes
multimodal and the standard RWMH algorithm does a poor job in capturing this multimodality.
We also introduce a small modification to the prior distribution used by SGU to estimate their news
shock model and find that conclusions about the importance of news shocks for business cycles can
change drastically. While SGU report that anticipated shocks explain about 70% of the variance
of hours worked, under our slightly modified prior the posterior distribution becomes bimodal and
most of the posterior probability concentrates near the mode that implies that the contribution
of anticipated shocks to hours is only 30%. The RWMH algorithm is unable to characterize this
multimodal posterior reliably.
We are building on several strands of the existing literature. There exists an extensive body of
work in the statistical literature on applying SMC methods to posterior inference for static model
parameters as in Chopin (2002). Textbook treatments can be found in Cappé, Moulines, and Ryden
(2005) and Liu (2008) and a recent survey is provided by Creal (2012). The theoretical analysis in
our paper builds heavily on Chopin (2004), by modifying his proofs to suit our particular version
of the SMC algorithm. So far as we know, ours is the second paper that uses SMC to implement

3
Bayesian inference in DSGE models. Creal (2007) presents a basic algorithm, which he applies to
the small-scale DSGE model of Rabanal and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2005). While we used his algorithm
as a starting point, the application to large-scale DSGE models required substantial modifications
including the more elaborate adaptive mutation step described above as well as a different sequence
of bridge distributions. Moreover, our implementation exploits parallel computation to substantially
speed up the algorithm, which is necessary for the practical implementation of this algorithm on
modern DSGE models.
In complementary research, Durham and Geweke (2012) use an SMC algorithm to estimate an
EGARCH model as well as several other small-scale reduced-form time series models. They employ
a graphical processing unit (GPU) to implement an SMC algorithm using the predictive likelihood
distribution as the bridge distribution. For our applications, the use of GPUs appeared impractical
because the solution and likelihood evaluation of DSGE models involves high-dimensional matrix
operations that are not readily available in current GPU programming languages. Durham and
Geweke (2012) also propose an adaptive tuning scheme for the sequence of the bridge distributions
and the proposal distributions used in the particle mutation step. They suggest to determine the
tuning parameters in a preliminary run of the SMC algorithm to ensure that the adaptive tuning
scheme does not invalidate the CLT for the SMC approximation. Our theoretical analysis suggests
that this is unnecessary, provided that the tuning scheme satisfies certain regularity conditions.
The authors propose a version of the SMC algorithm that divides particles into groups and carries
out independent computations for each group. The variation across groups provides a measure of
numerical accuracy. By running the SMC multiple times, we employ an evaluation scheme in our
paper that is similar in spirit to theirs.
Other authors have explored alternatives to the version of the RWMH algorithm that has become standard in DSGE model applications. Several papers have tried to address the problematic
aspects of the RWMH, including Chib and Ramamurthy (2010), Curdia and Reis (2010), Kohn,
Giordani, and Strid (2010), and Herbst (2011). These papers propose alternative MCMC algorithms
that improve upon the standard single-block RWMH algorithm by grouping parameters into blocks
and cycling over conditional posterior distributions (the so-called Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm) and by changing the proposal distribution that is used to generate proposed draws in the
Metropolis steps. Each of these algorithms, however, is an MCMC technique and remains to some
extent susceptible to the above criticism of highly correlated draws.

4
On the computational front, multiple processor and core environments are becoming more
readily available. While likelihood evaluation routines and MCMC algorithms can be written to
take advantage of this,1 neither is “embarrassingly parallelizable,” that is, neither naturally exploits
the parallel computing framework. This computational challenge might bias researchers to simulate
too few draws in their MCMC chains, exacerbating the statistical problem discussed above. SMC
algorithms, on the other hand, can easily take advantage of a parallel processing environment. In
the extreme case, each draw (or particle) from the initial distribution can be assigned to a separate
processor and then converted into a sequence of draws from the “bridge” distributions. True,
some communication between the processors is necessary to normalize the particle weights and to
potentially eliminate particle degeneracy by a re-sampling step. But the most time-consuming task,
namely the evaluation of the likelihood function, can be executed in parallel.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review some basic insights
underlying SMC methods. The SMC algorithm tailored to DSGE model applications is presented
in Section 3 and its theoretical properties are studied in Section 4. Section 5 contains three numerical illustrations, one pertaining to a stylized state space model, to motivate estimation problems
inherent to DSGE models, and two based on DSGE model posteriors obtained from actual U.S.
data. Section 6 concludes. The proofs for Section 4 and a detailed description of the DSGE models
estimated in Section 5 as well as additional empirical results are relegated to the Online Appendix.

Sequential Monte Carlo Methods

Let p(Y |θ) denote the likelihood function and p(θ) the prior density. The object of interest is the
posterior density p(θ|Y ) given by
p(Y |θ)p(θ)
p(θ|Y ) =
,
p(Y )

Z
where p(Y ) =

p(Y |θ)p(θ)dθ.

(1)

The parameter vector θ has support Θ. To economize on notation, we abbreviate this density
by π(θ) = p(θ|Y ). Moreover, we denote the numerator in (1) by f (θ) = p(Y |θ)p(θ) and the
denominator by Z, which does not depend on θ. Using this more compact notation
π(θ) =
1

f (θ)
.
Z

For instance, one can run separate Markov chains on each processor and subsequently merge the draws.

(2)

5
While for linearized DSGE models with Gaussian innovations and a regular prior density the function f (θ) can be evaluated to machine accuracy without the use of simulation approximations, the
normalization constant Z is unknown and closed-form expressions for posterior moments under
π(θ) are unavailable. Thus, posterior expectations of θ and transformations h(θ) have to be approximated numerically with Monte Carlo (MC) simulation methods. Most of the Bayesian DSGE
literature applies Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. As we will argue later, the increasing complexity of DSGE models combined with the emerging parallel framework for scientific
computing makes MCMC less attractive for sampling. Instead, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods, we will argue, are an appealing alternative simulation technique. We describe the basics
of SMC below. More elaborate explications can be found in Chopin (2002), Del Moral, Doucet,
and Jasra (2006), and Creal (2012).
One of the important steps in all SMC algorithms involves importance sampling: we might
try to approximate π(·) by using a different, tractable density g(θ) that is easy to sample from.
Importance sampling is based on the identity
Z
Eπ [h(θ)] =

1
h(θ)π(θ)dθ =
Z

Z
h(θ)w(θ)g(θ)dθ,

where

Suppose that θi ∼ g(θ), i = 1, . . . , N . Then, under suitable regularity conditions, see Geweke
(1989), the Monte Carlo estimate

i=1

where

w(θi )

W̃ i = PN

(4)

converges almost surely (a.s.) to Eπ [h(θ)] as N −→ ∞. The set of pairs {(θi , W̃ i )}N
i=1 provides
a particle approximation of π(θ). The W̃ i ’s are the (normalized) importance weights assigned to
each particle value θi . The accuracy of the approximation is driven by the “closeness” of g(·) to
f (·) and is reflected in the distribution of the weights. If the distribution of weights is very uneven,
the Monte Carlo approximation h̄ is inaccurate. Uniform weights arise if g(·) ∝ f (·), which means
that we are sampling directly from π(θ).
Importance sampling was first used for posterior inference in DSGE models by DeJong, Ingram,
and Whiteman (2000). However, in practice it is extremely difficult to find densities g(θ) that lead
to efficient importance samplers. This task is particularly challenging if the posterior has a nonnormal shape, containing several peaks and valleys. The essence of the SMC methods employed in

6
this paper is to construct sequential particle approximations to intermediate distributions, indexed
by n:2
πn (θ) =

[p(Y |θ)]φn p(θ)
fn (θ)
,
=R
Zn
[p(Y |θ)]φn p(θ)dθ

n = 1, . . . , φNφ

(5)

where φ1 = 0 and φNφ = 1. Note that πn (θ) = p(θ) for n = 1. Since priors in DSGE models are
typically specified such that draws can either be generated by direct sampling or with an efficient
acceptance sampler, the initialization of the SMC algorithm is straightforward. Thus, provided it is
possible to use the approximation of πn (θ) to assist in the construction of a particle approximation
for πn+1 (θ), one can use iterative approximations to estimate πNφ (θ) = π(θ). A function (here the
likelihood) raised to a power less than one is called a tempered function. The process of estimating
the parameters of a function through a sequence of tempered functions is known as simulated
tempering. This estimation framework has a long history in statistics; see Liu (2008) and the
references therein. It is common to refer to the sequence of tempering parameters as the tempering
schedule (or heating schedule, due to its connection to simulated annealing.)

An SMC Algorithm for DSGE Models

We begin with the description of the basic algorithm in Section 3.1. This algorithm consists of three
steps, using Chopin (2004)’s terminology: correction, that is, reweighting the particles to reflect
the density in iteration n; selection, that is, eliminating any particle degeneracy by resampling the
particles; and mutation, that is, propagating the particles forward using a Markov transition kernel
to adapt to the current bridge density. Section 3.2 provides details on the choice of the transition
kernel in the mutation step, and the adaptive choice of various tuning parameters is discussed in
Section 3.3. Finally, we provide a summary of the key aspects of our algorithm in Section 3.4.

3.1

The Basic Algorithm

To avoid confusion as to whether θ is drawn from πn (·) or πn+1 (·), we equip the parameter vector
with a subscript n. Thus, θn is associated with the density πn (·).
Algorithm 1 (Simulated Tempering SMC)
2
Using the notation that Yt1 :t2 = {yt1 , . . . , yt2 } and Y = Y1:T one could define an integer-valued sequence φn with
φ1 = 0 and φNφ = T and define fn (θ) = p(Y1:φn |θ). This data-point tempering approach is attractive for applications
in which θ is sequentially estimated on an increasing sample.

Our basic SMC algorithm requires tuning in two dimensions. First, the user has to specify the
number of particles N . Under suitable regularity conditions discussed in 4, the SMC approximations
of posterior moments satisfy a CLT, which implies that the precision (i.e. inverse variance) of the
approximation increases in proportion to N . Second, the user has to determine the tempering
N

φ
. All other things equal, increasing the number of stages, Nφ , will decrease the
schedule {φn }n=1

distance between bridge distributions and thus make it easier to maintain particle weights that are
close to being uniform. The cost of increasing Nφ is that each stage requires additional likelihood
evaluations. To control the shape of the tempering schedule we introduce a parameter λ:

φn =

n−1
Nφ − 1

λ
.

A large value of λ implies that the bridge distributions will be very similar (and close to the prior)
for small values of n and very different at a later stage when n is large. In the DSGE model
applications we found a value of λ = 2 to be very useful because for smaller values the information
from the likelihood function will dominate the priors too quickly and only a few particles will
survive the correction and selection steps. Conversely, if λ is much larger than 2, it makes some of
the bridge distributions essentially redundant and leads to unnecessary computations. The choice
of λ does not affect the overall number of likelihood evaluations.
Algorithm 1 is initialized by generating iid draws from the prior distribution. This initialization
will work well as long as the prior is sufficiently diffuse to assign non-trivial probability mass to the
area of the parameter space in which the likelihood function peaks.3 If the particles are initialized
based on a more general distribution with density g(θ), then for n = 2 the incremental weights
have to be corrected by the ratio p(θ)/g(θ). In the selection step the resampling is only executed
if the effective sample size ESS, which is a function of the variance of the particle weights, falls
below some threshold. We discuss the rationale for this threshold rule in more detail in Section 4.

3.2

The Transition Kernel for the Mutation Step

The transition kernel Kn (θn |θ̂n ; ζ) is generated through a sequence of M Metropolis-Hastings steps.
It is indexed by a vector of tuning parameters ζ. The transition kernel is constructed such that
3

There exist papers in the DSGE model estimation literature in which the posterior mean of some parameters is
several prior standard deviations away from the prior mean. For such applications it might be necessary to choose
φ1 > 0 and to use an initial distribution that is also informed by the tempered likelihood function [p(Y |θ)]φ1 .

9
for each ζ the posterior πn (θ) is an invariant distribution. The MH steps are summarized in the
following algorithm. Let θ∗ denote a particular set of values for the parameter vector θ and Σ∗ be
a covariance matrix that is conformable with the parameter vector θ. In Section 3.3 we will replace
θ∗ and Σ∗ by estimates of Eπn [θ] and Vπn [θ].

The particle-mutation algorithm uses several insights from the application of RWMH algorithms to DSGE models. First, Chib and Ramamurthy (2010) and Herbst (2011) have documented
that in DSGE model applications blocking of parameters can drastically reduce the persistence in
Markov chains generated by the MH algorithm. Nblocks determines the number of partitions of the
parameter vector. For simple models with elliptical posteriors, blocking the parameter vector is
unnecessary. When the posterior becomes complex or the dimensionality of the parameter vector
is large, however, moving all the parameters in a single block precludes all but the smallest moves.
This could hamper the mutation step. Second, Kohn, Giordani, and Strid (2010) proposed an
adaptive MH algorithm for DSGE model posteriors in which the proposal density is a mixture of
a random-walk proposal, an independence proposal, and a t-copula estimated from previous draws
of the chain. Adopting this general idea, our proposal density in Step 2(a) of Algorithm 2 is also a
mixture. The first component corresponds to a random-walk proposal with non-diagonal covariance
matrix, the second component is a random-walk proposal with diagonal covariance matrix, and the
third component is an independence proposal density.
The tuning parameter α ∈ [0, 1] controls the weight of the mixture components. The parameter
c scales the covariance matrices of the proposal densities.5 The number of MH steps M affects the
probability that the particle mutation step is successful in the sense that θni 6= θ̂ni . In practice, the
effect of increasing M turned out to be similar to the effect of raising Nφ and thereby reducing the
distance between bridge distributions. In the applications in Section 5 we set M = 1.

3.3

Adaption of the Transition Kernel

To achieve a good performance of the SMC algorithm it is important to choose some of the tuning
parameters adaptively, that is, tuning parameters for iteration n are chosen based on the particles
generated in iteration n − 1. We collect the adaptively chosen parameters in the vector ζ:

0
0
ζ = c, θ∗ , vech(Σ∗ )0 .

(11)

In the implementation of the mutation algorithm we fix the remaining tuning parameters, which
are M , Nblocks , and α. We also fix the tuning parameters N , Nφ , and λ for Algorithm 1 ex ante.
5

In principle one could use separate scaling factors for the three mixture components but in our applications a
single scaling factor was sufficient.

11
We use importance sampling approximations of Eπn [θ] and Vπn [θ] to specify θ∗ and Σ∗ and we
adjust the scaling factor c to ensure that the acceptance rate in the MH step is approximately 25%,
along the lines of Durham and Geweke (2012). At each iteration n we replace ζ in (11) with

0
ζ̂n = ĉn , θ̃n , vech(Σ̃n )0 ,

(12)

i
6
where ζ̂n is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra Fn−1,N generated by the particles {θn−1
, W̃ni }N
i=1 .

The following algorithm describes how ζ̂n is constructed at each iteration n.
Algorithm 3 (Adaptive Particle Mutation) Prior to Step 1 of Algorithm 2:
1. Compute importance sampling approximations θ̃n and Σ̃n of Eπn [θ] and Vπn [θ] based on the
i
particles {θn−1
, W̃ni }N
i=1 .

2. Compute the average empirical rejection rates R̂n−1 (ζ̂n−1 ), based on the Mutation step in
iteration n − 1. The averages are computed across the Nblocks blocks and across the three
mixture components separately.
3. Adjust the scaling factor according to

ĉn = ĉn−1 f R̂n−1 (ζ̂n−1 ) ,
where f (·) is given by
f (x) = 0.95 + 0.10

e16(x−0.25)
.
1 + e16(x−0.25)


0
4. Execute Algorithm 2 by replacing ζ with ζ̂n = ĉn , θ̃n , vech(Σ̃n )0 .
Note that f (0.25) = 1, which means that the scaling factor stays constant whenever the target
acceptance rate is achieved. If the acceptance rate is below (above) 25% the scaling factor is
decreased (increased). To satisfy the regularity conditions for the theoretical analysis in Section 4,
we chose a function f (x) that is differentiable.

We use “tilde” instead of “hat” for θ and Σ because the approximations are based on the correction step in
Algorithm 1.

Further Discussion

Our implementation of the SMC algorithm differs from that in Creal (2007) in two important dimensions. First, our mutation step is more elaborate. The mixture proposal distribution proved to
be important for adapting the algorithm to large-scale DSGE models with complicated multimodal
posterior surfaces. The random blocking scheme is important for avoiding bad blocks as the correlation structure of the tempered posterior changes. Moreover, the introduction of the tempering
parameter, λ, is crucial. Creal (2007) uses a linear cooling schedule (i.e., λ = 1). Even for a large
number of stages (nφ ) at n = 1, the information contained in [p(Y |θ)]φ1 dominates the information
contained in the prior. This means that initializing the algorithm from the prior is impractical, as
sample impoverishment occurs immediately. In light of this, Creal (2007) initializes the simulator
from a student-t distribution centered at the posterior mode. The initialization presumes prior
knowledge of the mode(s) of the posterior and is not well suited in applications where there are
many modes or the posterior is severely non-elliptical. Instead, by using a λ > 1, we are able to
add information from the likelihood to the prior slowly. This allows us to initialize the algorithm
from the prior, working without presupposition about the shape of the posterior. Collectively, these
additional tuning parameters yield a degree of flexibility that is crucial for the implementation of
SMC algorithms on large-scale DSGE models.
Second, our implementation exploits parallel computing to substantially speed up the algorithm.
This highlights a key advantage of SMC over MCMC routines. In Algorithm 2, step 2 involves
N × M × Nblocks MH steps. Here, the principal computational bottleneck is the evaluation of the
likelihood itself.7 The total number of likelihood evaluations in the SMC algorithm is equal to
N × Nφ × Nblocks × M . For some of the examples considered in this paper, that number can be in
the tens of millions. In our experience, the standard number of draws in an MCMC estimation of
a DSGE model is rarely more than one million. So it would appear that the SMC algorithm would
take a prohibitively long time to run. With SMC methods, however, one can exploit the fact that
the M × NB likelihood evaluations in Step 2 of Algorithm 2 can be executed independently for each
of the N particles. Given access to a multiple processor8 environment, this feature is very useful.
Because multiple core/processor setups are quite common, parallelization can be achieved easily in
many programming languages, e.g., via the MATLAB command parfor, even on a single machine.
7
We speed up the evaluation of the likelihood of the DSGE model by using the Chandrasekhar recursions to
compute the predictive decomposition of the likelihood. See Herbst (2012) for details.
8
We use the term processor to refer to the basic physical unit capable of executing a single thread.

13
In our implementation, we use multiple machines (distributed memory) communicating via a
Message Passing Interface (MPI). To get a sense of gains from parallelization, let T (P ) be the running time of an algorithm using P processors. The relative speedup is given by S(P ) = T (1)/T (P ).
For example, for the standard SW model in Section 5.2, S(24) ≈ 15, which means that using 24
processors speeds up the algorithm by a factor of 15. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests
that, for the specific model and computational setup used here, about 97% of the SMC algorithm’s
time is spent in Step 2 of Algorithm 2. This means that parallelization is extremely efficient.9

Theoretical Properties

We proceed with a formal analysis of Algorithm 1 and provide some regularity conditions under
which the SMC approximations satisfy a SLLN and CLT. The main results are summarized in
four theorems. The first three theorems establish a SLLN/CLT for the correction, selection, and
mutation steps of Algorithm 1. The fourth theorem shows that the adaptive choice of the transition
kernel discussed in Section 3.3 does not, under some regularity conditions, affect the asymptotic
variance of the SMC approximation. The first three theorems (and their proofs) essentially correspond to Lemmas A.1, A.2, and A.3 in Chopin (2004). We make three modifications: (i) while our
proofs closely follow the proofs in Chopin (2004), we use our specific assumptions about the prior
and likelihood function; (ii) our algorithm executes the three steps in a different order; and (iii) we
resample only if ESS falls below the threshold N/2, which requires an adjustment in some of the
asymptotic variance formulas. Although the first three theorems are not new, we think that it is
worthwhile to reproduce them, because the asymptotic variance formulas provide valuable insights
for practitioners into the behavior of the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, the fourth
theorem is new. It states that the adaptive choice of ζ has no effect on the limit distribution of
the SMC approximation. This asymptotic variance, of course, depends on ζ, which we define to be
the probability limit of ζ̂n in (12). Detailed proofs of the four theorems are provided in the Online
Appendix. We begin with some assumptions on the prior and the likelihood function:10
9

We perform this calculation as follows. Divide the algorithm instructions in two parts: a fraction 1 − F of
serial (i.e., non-parallelizable) instructions and F instructions which can be executed in parallel. Amdahl’s Law,
see Amdahl (1967), states that the best expected improvement from using P processors/cores/threads is T (P ) =
T (1)(1 − F + F/P ). Using the runtimes for our algorithm for various P s, we can come up with an (admittedly crude)
estimate for F .
10
Our Assumptions correspond to Conditions 3 and 4 in Durham and Geweke (2012).

uniformly bounded: supθ∈Θ

R

p(θ)dθ < ∞; (ii) the likelihood function is
R
p(Y |θ) < M < ∞; and (iii) [p(Y |θ)]φ2 p(θ)dθ > 0.

Assumption 1 Suppose that (i) the prior is proper:

For the analysis of a DSGE model, the restriction to proper prior distributions does not pose
a real constraint on the researcher. In fact most priors used in the literature are fairly informative
and many parameters have a bounded domain. We also assume that the likelihood function is
bounded from above and that there exists a set of parameters with non-zero measure under the
prior distribution for which the likelihood function is strictly positive, meaning that the marginal
tempered data density is positive at the observed data. Throughout this section we will assume that
the object of interest is the posterior mean of the scalar function h(θ). Extensions to vector-valued
functions are straightforward. The convergence of the sequential Monte Carlo approximations
requires the existence of moments. We define the classes of functions H1 and H2 as
H1 =



H2 =



Z

|h(θ)|1+δ p(θ)dθ < ∞ ,

Z

|h(θ)|2+δ p(θ)dθ < ∞

h(θ) ∃ δ > 0 s.t.
h(θ) ∃ δ > 0 s.t.

and our convergence results will apply to functions in these two classes. Assumption 1 implies that
for functions in Hj j + δ posterior moments exist for all values of the tempering parameter φ.11
We follow Chopin (2004) and state the convergence results in an inductive manner, starting
from the following assumption:
a.s.

Assumption 2
(i) h̄n−1,N −→ Eπn−1 [h] for every h ∈ H1 .
√
(ii) N (h̄n−1,N − Eπn−1 [h]) =⇒ N (0, Ωn−1 (h)) for every h ∈ H2 .
It is straightforward to verify that Assumption 2 is satisfied for n = 2. Recall that φ1 = 0.
According to Step 1 of Algorithm 1 the particles {θ1i , W1i } are obtained using an iid sample from
the prior distribution. Thus, for h ∈ H1 and h ∈ H2 the moment conditions for the SLLN and


the CLT for iid random variables are satisfied and Ω1 (h) = Eπ1 (h − Eπ1 [h])2 . To present the
subsequent results it is convenient to normalize the incremental weights as follows. Let
vn (θ) =
11

Zn−1
[p(Y |θ)]φn −φn−1
Zn

In principle the classes of functions Hj can be enlarged to functions for which posterior moments exist only if
φ ≥ φ > 0. In this case one could start the algorithm from φ1 = φ using a proposal density that delivers uniformly
bounded importance weights.

15
such that Eπn−1 [h(θ)vn (θ)] = Eπn [h(θ)]. Theorem 1 summarizes the convergence results for the
Monte Carlo approximations obtained after the correction step:
Theorem 1 [Correction Step] Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied. Then, h̃n,N defined


N (0, Ω̃n (h)), where Ω̃n (h) = Ωn−1 vn (θ) h(θ) − Eπn [h] , for every h ∈ H2 .
The asymptotic variance Ω̃n (h) has the familiar form of the variance of an importance sampling
approximation where the vn (θ)s correspond to the importance sampling weights. As discussed, for

instance, in Liu (2008), a crude approximation of Ω̃n (h) is given by (N/ESS)Ωn−1 h(θ) − Eπn [h] ,
which provides a rationale for monitoring ESS (see the selection step of Algorithm 1).12 However,
ESS does not directly measure the overall asymptotic variance of the SMC approximation. For
the subsequent selection step we distinguish between the case in which the particles are resampled,
i.e. ESS < N/2, and the case in which the resampling is skipped.
Theorem 2 [Selection Step] Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied. Then, ĥn,N defined
√
a.s.
in (7) converges as follows: (i) ĥn,N −→ Eπn [h] for every h ∈ H1 ; (ii) N (ĥn,N − Eπn [h]) =⇒
N (0, Ω̂n (h)) for every h ∈ H2 . Case (a): if the particles are resampled, then Ω̂n (h) = Ω̃n (h) +
Vπn [h]. Case (b): if the particles not are resampled, then Ω̂n (h) = Ω̃n (h).
A comparison of Ω̂n (h) in cases (a) and (b) highlights that the resampling adds noise Vπn [h]
to the Monte Carlo approximation. However, it also equalizes the particle weights and thereby
reduces the variance in the correction step of iteration n + 1. The rule of resampling whenever
ESS < N/2 tries to strike a balance between this trade-off. To obtain the convergence results for
the mutation step we need the following additional assumption on the transition kernel:
Assumption 3 πn (θ) is an invariant distribution associated with the transition kernel, that is:
R
θ̂ Kn (θ|θ̂; ζ)πn (θ̂)dθ̂ = πn (θ).
Theorem 3 [Mutation Step] Suppose that Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 are satisfied. Then, h̄n,N de√
a.s.
fined in (8) converges as follows: (i) h̄n,N −→ Eπn [h] for every h ∈ H1 ; (ii) N (h̄n,N − Eπn [h]) =⇒
12

Creal, Koopman, and Shephard (2009) suggest various visual indicators of weight performance: (i) a scatter plot
of the top 100 weights should be free of outliers; (ii) the histogram of the remaining weights should not be sharply
skewed, indicating that many of the particles have very little weight; and (iii) recursive estimates of the variance of
the weights should be stable.

step, then Ωn (h) = Eπn VKn (·|θ;ζ) [h] + Ω̂n EKn (·|θ̂n ;ζ) [h] . Case (b): If the last resampling was

The asymptotic variance Ωn (h) consists of two terms. The first term captures the average
conditional variance of the Markov transition kernel Kn (·|θ; ζ). If the particle weights are not equal
to one, then the conditional variance needs to get scaled by the weights, which are functions of
the particles from the previous iterations. The second term captures the variance of the average of
the conditional expectations EKn (·|θ̂i ;ζ) [h], which are functions of the resampled particles θ̂ni . The
n

variance Ωn (h) depends on the tuning parameter ζ of the Markov transition kernel.
To study the effect of choosing the tuning parameters ζ adaptively by replacing it with ζ̂n , where
i
ζ̂n is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by {θn−1
, W̃ni }N
i=1 , we use the following

decomposition
EKn (·|θ̂;ζ) [h] = h(θ̂) + Ψ(θ̂, ζ; h).

(13)



Since Eπn EKn (·|θ̂;ζ) [h] = Eπn [h] by Assumption 3, we deduce that Eπn [Ψ(θ̂, ζ; h)] = 0 for all ζ.
We now make the high-level assumption that ζ̂n approaches a limit value ζ as N −→ ∞ and that
Ψ(θ̂, ζ; h) is differentiable with respect to ζ.

Assumption 4 Suppose the following conditions are satisfied:
√
(i) N (ζ̂n − ζ) = Op (1)
(ii) Ψ(θ, ζ; h) ∈ H1 and Ψ(θ, ζ; h2 ) ∈ H1 are twice differentiable and there exist constants M1
and M2 , independent of θ and ζ, such that kΨζζ (θ, ζ; h)k < M1 and kΨζζ (θ, ζ; h2 )k < M2 .
Theorem 4 If Assumption 4 is satisfied then the fixed tuning parameters ζ in Algorithm 2 can be
replaced by the adaptive tuning parameters ζ̂n in Algorithm 3 without affecting the limit distribution
Ωn (h) in Theorem 3.

17
Since Eπn [Ψ(θ̂, ζ; h)] = 0 for all ζ, it is also the case that the expected values of the derivatives
with respect to ζ are equal to zero: Eπn [Ψζ (θ̂, ζ; h)] = 0 and Eπn [Ψζζ (θ̂, ζ; h)] = 0. The proof relies
on the insight that

Eπn [Ψζ (θ̂, ζ; h)] = 0. In the remainder of this section we will verify Assumption 4 for a special case
of Algorithm 2.
Example: Suppose that M = 1, Nblocks = 1, and α = 1. The transition density can be expressed
as
Kn (θ|θ̂; ζ) = αn (θ|θ̂; ζ)q(θ|θ̂; ζ) + rn (θ̂; ζ)δ(θ|θ̂),

(14)

where q(θ|θ̂; ζ) is the proposal density, δ(θ|θ̂) is the dirac function,13 and

is given by

Under the restriction α = 1 the conditional acceptance probability does not depend on ζ, that is,
αn (θ|θ̂; ζ) = αn (θ|θ̂), and the proposal density takes the form

It has the properties that δ(θ|θ̂) = 0 for θ 6= θ̂ and

R

δ(θ|θ̂)dθ = 1.

18
The derivatives of the log density with respect to ζ, lζ (θ|θ̂; ζ), and lζζ (θ|θ̂; ζ) are polynomial functions of θ and therefore integrable with respect to θ under the Gaussian proposal density q(θ|θ̂; ζ).
Thus, the differentiability condition of Assumption 4 is satisfied.
√
We now verify that N (ζ̂n −ζ) is stochastically bounded. Let Σ∗ = Vπn [θ] and define Σ̃n as the

Monte Carlo approximation of Σ∗ based on the particles {θn−1

i=1 . Then, Theorem 1 implies

N R̂j,n−1 (ζ̂n−1 ) − E[R̂j,n−1 (ζ̂n−1 )|F̂n−1,N ] converges in distribution to a Gaussian limit and is
therefore Op (1). Using the relationship between ĉn and the rejection rate in iteration n − 1 specified
√
in Algorithm 3, we deduce that N (ĉn − c) = Op (1). 
Verifying the regularity conditions for the general transition kernel associated with Algorithm 2
is more tedious. For M > 1 or Nblocks > 1 the representation of the transition kernel’s density
in (14) involves additional point masses and the expression for Ψ(θ̂, ζ; h) in (15) becomes more
complicated. For α < 1 it is no longer true that the conditional acceptance probability αn (θ|θ̂; ζ)
is invariant to ζ. Due to the min operator in the definition of αn (·) there are points at which the
function is no longer differentiable with respect to ζ. Thus, rather than verifying the differentiability
of the integrants in (15) directly one has to integrate with respect to θ separately over the regions

Θl = θ πn (θ)q(θ̂|θ, ζ) ≤ πn (θ̂)q(θ|θ̂, ζ) and Θu = Θ\Θl and show that the boundary ∂Θl is a
smooth function of ζ.

Applications

We now consider three applications of the proposed SMC algorithm and provide comparisons to
a standard RWMH algorithm. Section 5.1 evaluates the posterior distribution of a small stylized
state-space model based on simulated data. In Section 5.2 we consider the SW model. Typically, the

19
SW model is estimated under a fairly informative prior distribution that leads to a well-behaved
posterior distribution when combined with U.S. data. However, under a less informative prior
the posterior distribution becomes more irregular and provides an interesting application for our
algorithm. Finally, in Section 5.3 we apply the algorithm to a real business cycle model proposed
by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2012) which, in addition to standard shocks, is driven by a large
number of anticipated shocks, e.g., news about future changes in technology. These news shocks
make parameter identification more difficult. The SW model and the SGU model are estimated
based on actual U.S. data.

5.1

A Stylized State-Space Model

To illustrate the difficulties that can arise when generating draws from the posterior density p(θ|Y ),
consider the following stylized state-space model discussed in Schorfheide (2010):

yt = [1 1]st ,

st = 

φ3 φ2



(16)

The mapping between some structural parameters θ = [θ1 , θ2 ]0 and the reduced-form parameters
φ = [φ1 , φ2 , φ3 ]0 is assumed to be
φ1 = θ12 ,

φ2 = (1 − θ12 ),

φ3 − φ2 = −θ1 θ2 .

(17)

The first state, s1,t , looks like a typical exogenous driving force of a DSGE model, e.g., total
factor productivity, while the second state s2,t evolves like an endogenous state variable, e.g., the
capital stock, driven by the exogenous process and past realizations of itself. The mapping from
structural to reduced form parameters is chosen to highlight the identification problems endemic
to DSGE models. First, θ2 is not identifiable when θ1 is close to 0, since it enters the model only
multiplicatively. Second, there is a global identification problem. Root cancellation in the AR and
MA lag polynomials for yt causes a bimodality in the likelihood function. To illustrate this, we
simulate T = 200 observations given θ = [0.45, 0.45]0 . This parameterization is observationally
equivalent to θ = [0.89, 0.22]0 . Moreover, we use a prior distribution that is uniform on the square
0 ≤ θ1 ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ θ2 ≤ 1.
Tuning of Algorithms. The SMC algorithm is configured as follows. We set Nφ = 50, N = 1024,

Notes: The left panel shows a contour plot of the log likelihood function overlaid with draws from
the RWMH (red) and SMC (red) algorithms. The right panel shows sequential density estimates
of πn (θ1 ) using output from the SMC algorithm. Here n = 1, . . . , 50, φ1 = 0, and φ50 = 1.
and λ = 1. Since this is a very simple (and correctly specified) model, we use only Nblocks = 1
block, M = 1, and set α = 0.9. The SMC algorithm works extremely well for this small problem,
so changing the hyperparameters does not change the results or running time very much. For
comparison, we also run the standard RWMH algorithm with a proposal density that is a bivariate
independent normal scaled to achieve a 25% acceptance rate. Changing this proposal variance does
not materially affect the results.
Results. The left panel of Figure 1 plots the contours of the posterior density overlaid with draws
from the SMC algorithm (black) and the RWMH (red). It is clear that the RWMH algorithm fails
to mix on both modes, while the SMC does a good job of capturing the structure of the posterior.
To understand the evolution of the particles in the SMC algorithm, in the right panel of Figure 1
φ
R
we show estimates of the sequence of (marginal) densities πn (θ1 ) ∝
p(Y |θ1 , θ2 ) n p(θ1 , θ2 )dθ2 ,
where φn = (n − 1)/49 and n = 1, . . . 50. The density for θ1 starts out very flat, reflecting the
fact that for low n the uniform prior dominates the scaled likelihood. As n increases, the bimodal
structure quickly emerges and becomes very pronounced as φn approaches one. This plot highlights
some of the crucial features of SMC. The general characteristics of the posterior are established
relatively quickly in the algorithm. For larger DSGE models, this feature will guide our choice set
λ > 1, as the early approximations are crucial for the success of the algorithm. As the algorithm
proceeds, the approximation at step n provides a good importance sample for the distribution at

21
step n + 1.

5.2

The Smets-Wouters Model

The SW model is a medium-scale macroeconomic model that has become an important benchmark
in the DSGE model literature. The model is typically estimated with data on output, consumption,
investment, hours, wages, inflation, and interest rates. The details of the model, which we take
exactly as presented in SW, are summarized in the Online Appendix. In our subsequent analysis
we consider two prior distributions. The first prior, which we refer to as the standard prior, is
the one used by SW and many of the authors that build on their work. Our second prior is less
informative than SW’s prior and we will refer to it as the diffuse prior. However, the second prior
is still proper.
Comparison Among Algorithms. We compute posterior moments based on our proposed SMC
algorithm as well as a standard RWMH algorithm. To assess the precision of the Monte Carlo
approximations, we run both algorithms 20 times and compute means and standard deviations of
posterior moment estimates across runs. To the extent that the number of particles is large enough
for the CLTs presented in Section 4 to be accurate, the standard deviations reported below for
the SMC can be interpreted as simulation approximations of the asymptotic variance (for n = Nφ )
that appears in Theorem 3. We have taken some care to ensure an “apples-to-apples” comparison
by constraining the processing time to be roughly the same across algorithms. Given our choice
of tuning parameters (see below) the SMC algorithm for the SW model with the standard prior
(diffuse prior) runs about 1 hour and 40 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) using two twelve-core
Intel Xeon X5670 CPUs (24 processors in total) in parallel. The code is written in Fortran 95 and
uses the distributed-memory communication interface MPI.
When comparing the SMC and RWMH algorithms, it is important to avoid giving the SMC
algorithm an advantage simply because it can more easily exploit parallel programming techniques.
In principle, we could instead run 24 copies of the RWMH on separate processor cores and merge
the results afterwards. This may reduce sampling variance if each of the RWMH chains has reliably
converged to the posterior distribution. However, if there is a bias in the chains – because of, say,
the failure to mix on a mode in a multimodal posterior or simply a slowly converging chain –
then merging chains will not eliminate that bias. Moreover, choosing the length of the “burnin” phase may become an issue as discussed in Rosenthal (2000). Instead, we use a poor-man’s

22
parallelization of the RWMH algorithm. It is possible to parallelize MH algorithms via pre-fetching
as discussed in Strid (2009). Pre-fetching tries to anticipate the points in the parameter space that
the MH algorithm is likely to visit in the next k iterations and executes the likelihood evaluation for
these parameter values in parallel. Once the likelihood values have been computed one can quickly
determine the next k draws. While coding the parallel MCMC algorithm efficiently is quite difficult,
the simulation results reported in Strid (2009) suggest that a parallelization using 24 processors
would lead to a speedup factor of eight at best. Thus, in our poor-man’s parallelization, we simply
increase the running time of the RWMH algorithm on a single CPU by a factor of eight. This
results in approximately 10 million draws.
Tuning of Algorithms. The hyperparameters of the SMC algorithm for the estimation under
the standard prior are N = 12, 000, Nφ = 500, λ = 2.1, Nblocks = 3, M = 1, and α = 0.9.
The total product of the number of particles, stages, and blocks was chosen by the desired run
time of the algorithm. The choice of Nφ at 500 was somewhat arbitrary, but it ensured that the
bridge distributions were never too “different.” The parameter λ was calibrated by examining the
correction step at n = 1. Essentially, we increased λ until the effective sample size after adding
the first piece of information from the likelihood was at least 10, 000; roughly speaking, 80% of the
initial particles retained substantial weight. We settled on the number of blocks by examining the
behavior of the adaptive scaling parameter c in a preliminary run. Setting Nblocks = 3 ensured that
the proposal variances were never scaled down too much for sufficient mutation. For the estimation
under the diffuse prior we increase the number of blocks to Nblocks = 6. For the RWMH algorithm,
we scale the proposal covariance to achieve an acceptance rate of approximately 30% over 5 million
draws after a burn-in period of 5 million. Each RWMH chain was initialized with a draw from the
prior distribution.
Results from the Standard Prior. It turns out that the results for the RWMH algorithm and
the SMC algorithm are close, both for the posterior means and for the 5% and 95% quantiles of the
posterior distribution. The Online Appendix contains a table with posterior means as well as 90%
equal-tail-probability credible intervals obtained from the two algorithms. A visual comparison of
the RWMH and SMC algorithm under the standard prior is provided in the left panel of Figure 2.
For seven selected parameters, Figure 2 presents the estimates of the mean, 5th, and 95th percentiles
of the posterior distribution. The shaded region covers plus and minus two standard deviations

shown in black, while the SMC estimates are in red. The figure shows that both simulators are
capturing the distribution, although the SMC algorithm is more precise, as indicated by the size of
the red boxes relative to the black ones.
The parameter where this difference is most stark is µp , which is the moving average term in
the exogenous ARMA(1,1) price-markup shock process. For µp the black boxes representing the
noise around estimates of the mean, 5th, and 95th percentiles overlap, which indicates substantial
convergence problems. A close inspection of the output from the posterior simulators shows the
reason for this. On two of the twenty runs for the RWMH algorithm, the simulator becomes trapped
in a region with relatively low posterior density. That is, there is a local mode on which the RWMH
gets stuck. Note that this mode is small, so that it can be safely ignored when characterizing the
posterior distribution, unlike the multimodal posterior distributions seen below. Perhaps most
disturbing is that output from these simulators “looks” fine, in the sense that there are no abrupt
shifts in acceptance rates, recursive means, or other summary statistics routinely used as indications
of convergence. The SMC algorithm easily avoids getting trapped in the vicinity of this mode, as
the relatively small weight on particles in this region ensures they are dropped during a resampling
step or mutated.

In addition to the posterior distribution of the parameters, the so-called marginal data density
R
(MDD) p(Y ) = p(Y |θ)p(θ)dθ plays an important role in DSGE model applications, because it
determines the posterior model probability. The MDD is the normalization constant that appears
in the denominator of (1) and as constant Z in (2). The top panel of Table 1 shows estimates of the
marginal data densities (MDD) associated with the posterior simulators. While the SMC algorithm
delivers an estimate of the MDD as a by-product of the simulation, for the RWMH an auxiliary
estimator must be used. We use the modified harmonic mean estimator of Geweke (1999). The
estimates in Table 1 indicate that the SMC algorithm is a more stable estimator of the MDD. The
high standard deviation of the RWMH-based estimate is driven by the two runs that get stuck in
a local mode. These runs produce MDD estimates of about −902.6, a much worse fit relative to
the SMC algorithm.
The Diffuse Prior. Some researchers argue that the prior distributions used by SW are implausibly tight, in the sense that they seem hard to rationalize based on information independent of the
information in the estimation sample. For instance, the tight prior on the steady-state inflation rate
is unlikely to reflect a priori beliefs of someone who has seen macroeconomic data only from the
1950s and 1960s. At the same time, this prior has a strong influence on the empirical performance
of the model, as discussed in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013). Closely related, Müller (2011)
derives an analytical approximation for the sensitivity of posterior means to shifts in prior means
and finds evidence that the stickiness of prices and wages is driven substantially by the priors.
One side benefit of tight prior distributions is that they tend to smooth out the posterior
surface by down-weighting areas of the parameter space that exhibit local peaks in the likelihood
function but are deemed unlikely under the prior distribution. Moreover, if the likelihood function

Notes: Means and standard deviations are over 20 runs for each algorithm. The RWMH algorithms
use 10 million draws with the first 5 million discarded. The SMC algorithms use 12,000 particles
and 500 stages. The two algorithms utilize approximately the same computational resources. We
define Nef f = V̂π [θ]/ST D2 .
contains hardly any information about certain parameters and is essentially flat with respect to
these parameters, tight priors induce curvature in the posterior. In both cases the prior information
stabilizes the posterior computations. For simulators such as the RWMH this is crucial, as they
work best when the posterior is well-behaved. With a view toward comparing the effectiveness of the
different posterior simulators, we relax the priors on the SW model substantially. For parameters
which previously had a Beta prior distribution we now use a uniform distribution. Moreover, we
scale the prior variances of the other parameters by a factor of three – with the exception that we
leave the priors for the shock standard deviations unchanged. A table with the full specification of
the prior is available in the Online Appendix.
Results from the Diffuse Prior. Table 2 summarizes the output of the posterior simulators
under the diffuse prior, focusing on parameters for which the standard deviation (STD) of the
posterior mean approximation under the RWMH algorithm is greater than 0.02 (the results for the
remaining parameters are reproduced in the Online Appendix). While the average estimated mean
of the posterior seems to be roughly the same across the algorithms, the variance across simulations

26
is substantially higher under the RWMH algorithm. For instance, the standard deviation of the
estimate of the mean for ρw , the autoregressive coefficient for the wage markup, is 0.09. Given the
point estimate of 0.69, this means that any given run of the simulator could easily return a mean
between 0.5 and 0.9, even after simulating a Markov chain of length 10 million. In almost all cases,
the SMC estimates are about half as noisy, usually substantially less so.
Suppose we were able to generate M iid draws from the marginal posterior distribution for a
parameter θ. The variance of the mean of these draws would be given by V(M EAN ) = Vπ /M .
Thus, we define Nef f = V̂π [θ]/ST D2 , where V̂π [θ] is an estimate of the posterior variance of
θ obtained from the output of the SMC algorithm and ST D2 is the variance of the posterior
mean estimate across the 20 runs of each algorithm. The effective sample sizes Nef f are also
reported in Table 2. The Nef f differences across the two algorithms are striking. The SMC
algorithm is substantially more efficient, generating effective sample sizes that are one to two
orders of magnitudes larger. Nef f for the inverse Frisch elasticity of labor supply σl is 1058 for
the SMC algorithm and only 60 for the RWMH. The least efficient numerical approximation is
obtained for the posterior mean of the parameters governing the wage (ξw , ιw , ρw , µw ) and price
(ξp , µp , σp ) stickiness. Under the SMC algorithm Nef f ranges from 43 to 126, whereas for the
RWMH algorithm the effective sample size ranges from 1 to 36.
We return to Figure 2, which graphically illustrates the precision of the algorithms estimates
of the mean, 5th, and 95th percentiles of selected parameters. For the diffuse prior, the differences
across algorithms are more pronounced. First, note that relative to the analysis with the standard
prior, the posterior distributions are now more spread out. Second, the precision of the estimates
is much lower for the RWMH simulations than for the SMC simulations, as the black boxes are
generally much larger than the red boxes. In fact, the performance of the RWMH algorithm is
so poor that for the parameters restricted to the unit intervals, the boxes overlap substantially,
meaning that there is sufficient noise in the RWMH algorithm to tangle the, say, 5th and 95th
percentile of the posterior distribution for µp . Moreover, the figure confirms the message from
Table 2: some of the worst performing aspects of the RWMH algorithm are associated with the
parameters controlling the movements of wages and prices.
To examine the posterior distribution more closely, we plot joint kernel density estimates of
parameters from the wage and price block of the model. The two panels of Figure 3 display joint
density estimates of [ρw , ξw ] and [ρp , µp ]. ρw is the autocorrelation parameter in the exogenous

of nominal wage rigidity. The parameters ρp and µp are the autoregressive and moving-average
coefficients of the exogenous price-markup shock process. The black line shows the 45◦ line. It is
clear that both panels display multimodal, irregular posterior distributions, exacerbated by hard
parameter boundaries.14 For the left panel, it is clear that when the autoregressive coefficient for
the exogenous wage-markup parameter, ρw , is very close to one, the endogenous wage stickiness of
the model, embodied in the wage-Calvo parameter ξw , is less important. On the other hand, when
ξw is close to one, the exogenous persistence of wage movements is much lower. The right panel in
Figure 3 shows identification problems related to the coefficients of the ARMA(1,1) price-markup
shock process.
Motivated by the bimodal features of the bivariate posteriors displayed in Figure 3, we graph
estimates of posterior probabilities associated with particular regions in the parameter space in
Figure 4. According to Figure 3 there exists a mode for which ρw > ξw (ρp > µp ) and a mode for
which ρw < ξw (ρp < µp ). To measure the posterior probabilities associated with these regions it is
necessary for the posterior simulator to mix draws from the two modal regions in the right proportion. Figure 4 shows that the RWMH algorithm has severe difficulties approximating the posterior
probabilities precisely. The RWMH estimates are highly variable, and in the case of Pπ {ρp ≥ µp }
range from 0 to 1, whereas the SMC algorithm fairly precisely determines this probability to be

We did some exercises using parameters transformed to unbounded space. The results were essentially unchanged.

To further explore the multimodal shape of the posterior under the diffuse prior, Table 3 lists
the values of the key wage and price parameters at two modes of the joint posterior density captured
by the SMC algorithm.15 With respect to wages, the modes identify two different drivers of fit.
15

Note that these two modes of the joint posterior are different from the two modes in the marginal posteriors for
[ρw , ξw ] and [ρp , µp ] seen in Figure 3.

29
At Mode 1, the values of the wage Calvo parameter, ξw , and wage indexation parameter, ιw , are
relatively low, while the parameters governing the exogenous wage markup process, ρw and µw , are
high. That is, model dynamics for wages near this mode are driven by the exogenous persistence
of the shock. At Mode 2, the relative importance of the parameters is reversed. The persistence of
wages is driven by the parameters that control the strength of the endogenous propagation, echoing
the shape in Figure 3. The exogenous wage markup process is much less persistent. We see that the
data support both endogenous and exogenous persistence mechanisms. Thus, a researcher’s priors
can heavily influence the assessment of the importance of nominal rigidities, echoing a conclusion
reached by Del Negro and Schorfheide (2008).
Finally, we return to the marginal data densities, which for the SW model with diffuse prior
are reported in the bottom panel of Table 1. The SMC estimate is much more precise, which is
unsurprising, given the difficulties of using the modified harmonic mean estimator on a bimodal
distribution. The modified harmonic mean estimator actually performs better on the model with
diffuse prior than on model with standard prior, mostly because the “height” of the different modes
is more similar. Still, the high standard deviation of the estimate indicates severe problems in the
algorithm. Finally, as a substantive point it should be noted that the diffuse prior model has
an MDD that is about 30 log points higher than the standard prior SW model. This is a large
difference in favor of the diffuse prior model and it highlights the a strong tension between the
standard prior and the data. This point may apply more generally to DSGE models.

5.3

The Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe News Model

The final application is SGU’s “news” model, which has been used to examine the extent to which
anticipated shocks (i.e., news) to technology, government spending, wage markups, and preferences
explain movements in major macroeconomic time series at business cycle frequencies. The core of
the SGU is a real business cycle model with real rigidities in investment, capital utilization, and
wages. While there is not enough space to go through the complete model here, we summarize
the key features below. The complete equilibrium conditions for this model are summarized in the
Online Appendix.
Important Model Features. We focus on two key features of the SGU model. First, the model
has seven exogenous processes in total: stationary and nonstationary technology, stationary and
nonstationary investment specific technology, government spending, wage markup, and preference

30
shocks. Each of the seven processes is driven by three (independent) innovations, one of which is
realized contemporaneously, and two of which are realized four and eight quarters ahead. So, the
determination of a given exogenous process xt looks like:
x,4
x,8
xt = ρx xt−1 + x,0
t + t−4 + t−8 .

Each innovation x,h is scaled by its own variance, σxh , for horizons h = 0, 4, 8. Given the model’s
seven exogenous processes, there are 21 shocks in total, plus a measurement error for output.
This framework allows one to capture anticipated changes in, say, productivity as a driver of the
business cycle. This can lead to expectation-driven booms, which are, strictly speaking ruled out
in most DSGE models. In forward-looking models anticipated shocks can have large effects, so it is
crucial for the econometrician to recover plausible values for the size of these shocks. The second
key feature of the SGU model is that households a nonstandard utility function. Specifically,
the representative agent has constant-relative-risk-aversion (CRRA) preferences defined over Vt , a
bundle of consumption (Ct ), labor (Lt ), and additional variable St :
Vt = Ct − bCt−1 − ψLθt St .
The parameter b controls the degree to which households display (internal) habit formation, and
the parameters ψ and θ are related to the level and elasticity of labor supply, respectively. The
variable St reflects a geometric average of past habit-adjusted consumption:
1−γ
St = (Ct − bCt−1 )γ St−1
.

The presence of St , owing to Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009), nests two popular specifications for
preferences. As γ −→ 1, preferences take the form introduced by King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988).
Here, the labor choice will be related to the intertemporal consumption-savings decision; that is,
there will be a wealth effect on labor supply. This is the standard form of preferences used in most
estimated DSGE models. In a model with anticipated shocks, it might be problematic because,
if there is a large wealth effect, hours today might fall in response to positive news about future
economic conditions. On the other hand, as γ −→ 0, preferences take the form of Greenwood,
Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988). Labor supply depends only on the current real wage: the wealth
effect on labor supply is eliminated. Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) highlight how crucial this style

31
of preference – coupled with specific adjustment costs – is to generating comovements in response
to the news about technology shocks. It is important to note that γ must lie strictly above zero to
be compatible with a balanced growth path for the economy.
The model is estimated on seven economic time series: real GDP growth, real consumption
growth, real investment growth, real government spending growth, hours, TFP growth and the
relative price of investment. The estimation period is 1955:Q1 to 2006:Q4. This model is an
interesting application for the SMC algorithm for several reasons. First, the scale of the model
is quite large. There are almost 100 states and 35 estimated parameters. Second, the model
contains many parameters for which the priors are quite diffuse, relative to standard priors used in
macroeconometrics. In particular, this is true for the variances of the shocks. Also, the prior for
the Jaimovich-Rebelo parameter, γ, is uniform across [0, 1]. We estimate the SGU model under the
prior specified by SGU (tabulated in the Online Appendix) and a modified version of this prior in
which we change the distribution of the preference parameter γ.
Tuning of Algorithms. We run the same comparison as in previous sections. For each posterior
simulator, we compute 20 runs of the algorithm. For the SMC runs, we use N = 30, 048 particles,
Nφ = 500 stages, λ = 2.1, Nblocks = 6 blocks, M = 1, and α = 0.9. We choose the tuning
parameters in a way similar to that for the SW model. We use many more particles because the
parameter space is larger and the prior is more diffuse compared to the SW model. Given the highdimensional parameter vector, we increase the number of blocks from 3 to 6 to ensure that mutation
still can occur. For the RWMH algorithm, we simulate chains of length 10 million, considering only
the final 5 million draws. For the proposal density we use a covariance matrix computed from an
earlier run, scaled so that the acceptance rate is roughly 32%. The SMC algorithm takes about
14 hours to run while the RWMH algorithm takes about 4 days. This suggests that a parallelized
RWMH algorithm with a speed-up factor of 6.85 would take roughly as long as the SMC algorithm.
This is in line with the estimates of Strid (2009), so we take it that the algorithms are on roughly
equal footing in terms of computing power.
Results from the SGU Prior. Table 4 displays the posteriors for the SGU model with the
standard prior. It is clear that the average posterior means from the RWMH and SMC algorithms
are roughly the same, with a few exceptions, but that the posteriors generated by the RWMH
algorithm are substantially noisier. Mean estimates of parameters associated with news about the
wage markup, σµ4 and σµ8 , have standard deviations about twice as large under the RWMH simulator

Notes: Means and standard deviations are over 20 runs for each algorithm. The RWMH algorithms
use 10 million draws with the first 5 million discarded. The SMC algorithms use 30,048 particles
and 500 stages. The two algorithms utilize approximately the same computational resources. We

relative to the SMC simulator. Related, in terms of coverage, the posterior credible interval for the
standard deviation of the contemporaneous wage markup shock, σµ0 , has a 95% quantile estimate to
be 2.79 under the SMC algorithm and 2.39 under the RWMH algorithm. Furthermore, the estimate
of the mean of the Jaimovich-Rebelo parameter, γ, under the SMC algorithm is outside the 90%
credible interval generated by the RWMH algorithm (not listed in Table 4). Estimates related
to news about the investment specific technology shock, σz4i and σz8i , similarly contain much more
Monte Carlo noise under the RWMH. Using the numeric efficiency measure discussed in Section 5.2,
there are about 3 times as many independent draws in the SMC samples relative to the RWMH
samples, based on the median parameter.
To shed light on the relative performance of the simulators, Figure 5 displays histograms for
the marginal posterior of parameters associated with the wage markup process. For each of the 20
runs we are computing separate histograms. Each box is centered at the mean relative histogram
height across the 20 runs for the RWMH (black) and SMC (red) algorithms. The shaded rectangles
span plus and minus two standard deviations (across the 20 runs) about this mean. We choose
evenly-sized bins for the histograms, restricting the span of the bins to a range with non-trivial

posterior density. In the upper left panel, the histogram estimates for ρµ , the persistence of the
wage markup, shows that the RWMH and SMC algorithm capture roughly the same posterior
shape. The size of the black boxes relative to the red boxes shows that the SMC estimator is much
more precise. For the parameter, σµ0 , the standard deviation of unanticipated markup shock, the
posteriors appear very slightly different, as the SMC algorithm has a long tail, consistent with the
difference in credible intervals discussed above.
Finally, the bottom two panels of Figure 5 indicate that the RWMH has the most trouble with
the multimodalities and irregularities associated with the variances of the news shocks. Looking
at the size of the boxes, it is clear that these bimodal distributions are more precisely estimated
using SMC. For instance, σµ4 , the size of the four-quarter-ahead news about wage markups has two
sharp peaks, one roughly at 0.35, and another at 4.9. The reason for the two peaks is a (global)
identification problem. The model has difficulty distinguishing markup news at 4-quarter-ahead
frequency from 8-quarter ahead. This is borne out by the density of σµ8 , which has similar bimodal

shape the density of σµ4 , although the heights are peaked differently.16 Indeed, in the posterior
correlation of the two parameters is −0.9. The Online Appendix plots a kernel density estimate
of the bivariate posterior. In this particular instance, the economic effects of anticipated shocks
are unchanged by the failure of the RWMH to mix properly, precisely because of the identification
problem: the effects of an eight- and four-periods-ahead shock are very similar. On the other hand,
fine parsings of the structural results are incorrect under the RWMH. For instance, Table 6 of SGU
reports that eight-periods-ahead shocks are responsible for about five percent of the variation in
hours worked. Our RWMH runs that do not mix on the second σµ8 are consistent with that result.
The SMC algorithm, which properly reflects the bimodal structure of the shock variances, puts that
number close to 20% and, in general, places more importance on longer run news about wages.
With respect to the Jaimovich-Rebelo parameter, γ, the posteriors generated by the RWMH
and the SMC algorithm yield small but interesting differences. The left panel of Figure 6 displays
the histograms for the posterior for γ. The histograms are set up as in Figure 5, with the exception
that the left panel has a different scale for the smallest bin. The RWMH algorithm essentially finds
a “pointmass” very close to zero. All of the draws from the RWMH runs are less than 0.03, which
we refer to as Mode 1. The SMC algorithm also finds significant posterior probability mass near

To examine whether the bimodality is specific to the U.S. data that are used to estimate the SGU model, we
re-estimated the model based on simulated data. The posterior obtained from simulated data exhibits a similar
bimodal shape as the posterior given the actual data.

zero, but in addition it detects a small mode (Mode 2) around γ = 0.6, comprising about 3% of
the total posterior. This can be seen again by looking at the red boxes to the right of 0.1, vs. the
non-existent black boxes. Keep in mind though, that the scale for Mode 2 is magnified relative to
Mode 1.
The two modes have very different economic implications. Near Mode 2 the wealth effect associated with an increase in income is nonzero. This changes the dynamics of the news model:
positive news about the future tend to decrease labor supplied today, because consumers anticipate
higher income in the future. Indeed, a parameter value of γ ≈ 0.6 implies that the importance of
anticipated shocks for hours is substantially diminished. To compensate for the reduced importance of anticipated shocks, values of γ ≈ 0.6 are associated with high standard deviations of the
unanticipated wage-markup shock. Overall, a variance decomposition implies that conditional on
γ ≈ 0.6 unanticipated movements in the wage markup account for about 50% of the movement in
hours, compared with just 10% of the movement when γ ≈ 0. Thus, for parameters near Mode 2,
movements in hours are not principally driven by news.
Results from a Modified Prior. To highlight this potential pitfall more clearly, we re-estimate
the news model under a different prior for γ, namely, γ ∼ Beta(2, 1). Relative to the uniform prior,
this prior places more mass on the region near 1. Its probability density function is a 45-degree
line. A possible justification for this prior is that it places more weight on the “standard” utility
functions used in the macroeconomics literature. Mechanically, this prior causes Mode 2 in the
original SGU model to become more important. Indeed, now most of the mass resides in this
region, although the peak at γ ≈ 0 is still important. The heights of the two modes in the posterior
distribution of γ is approximately equal under the modified prior. The right panel of Figure 6
displays the histogram estimates for γ under the new prior for 20 runs each of the RWMH (black)
and the SMC (red) algorithms. One can see that the estimates for γ are now extremely noisy,
place anywhere from 0 to 1 probability mass in the region [0, 0.05] for the RWMH, indicating that
some runs of the RWMH did not mix on both modes. The reason for this is that the peak around
γ ≈ 0 is extremely sharp and the valley around is very deep. If the RWMH gets to this region, it is
extremely unlikely to ever leave it. On the other hand, the SMC algorithm mixes on both modes
easily.
To see how this translates into problems for substantive economic inference, Figure 7 plots
the histograms for the share of the long-run variance in hours accounted for by anticipated shocks

Notes: Prior (Blue), RWMH (Black), and SMC (Red). The boxes show estimates of histograms
for the share of long-run variance in hours attributable to news shocks from each of the simulators.
The RWMH algorithm is in red and the SMC is in black. The prior share is shown with the blue
line. The left panel shows output from the standard prior model and the right panel shows output
from the diffuse prior model. Each box is centered at the mean of the number of elements in each,

under both priors along with the prior shares. Under the standard prior, both simulators generate
roughly the same posterior variance shares, although the SMC has a slightly longer left tail due
to the small second mode, and to be sure, this tail is relatively imprecisely estimated (as it is
small). Once the prior for γ is changed to a Beta(2, 1) distribution, the problems associated with
the RWMH are exacerbated and inference is substantially changed. As with the posterior for γ, the
RWMH places anywhere from 0 to 1 probability mass on the anticipated shocks accounting for 80%
of the long-run movements in hours. The bimodal shape of the posterior distribution distribution
of the news shock share under the modified prior is much more precisely estimated by the SMC
algorithm and the economic inference is not overwhelmed by Monte Carlo noise. Relative to the
standard prior, news shocks are much less important in determining the behavior of hours.
Finally, we report log marginal data density estimates in Table 5. As in the case of the SmetsWouters model the modified harmonic mean estimate computed from the output of the RWMH
algorithm is more noisy, in particular under the modified prior. It turns out that the data slightly
favor the model specification with the original SGU prior distribution, but further modifications,
e.g. larger prior variances, may easily overturn this ranking. While the analysis under the modified
prior was designed to highlight the merit of the SMC sampler, it makes an empirical point as well.

Conclusions about the importance of news as a drivers of the business cycle are very sensitive to
prior choices. By pushing the prior for γ towards more standard values in the literature, we were
able to reduce the effect of news on hours substantially. This result signals cautious interpretation
of DSGE model-based estimates of the importance (or lack thereof) of news on the business cycle.

Conclusion

This paper has presented an alternative simulation technique for estimating Bayesian DSGE models. We showed that, when properly tailored to DSGE models, a sequential Monte Carlo technique
can be more effective than the random walk Metropolis Hastings algorithm. The RWMH is poorly
suited to dealing with complex and large posteriors, while SMC algorithms, by slowly building a
particle approximation of the posterior, can overcome the problems inherent in multimodality. This
is important for DSGE models, where the parameters enter the likelihood in a highly nonlinear fashion and identification problems may be present. We have seen in the both the SW model and the
SGU model that when priors are not very informative, the posterior can possess multimodalities.
It is difficult to correctly characterize the posterior with the RWMH in this case. Moreover, the
SMC algorithm has an embarrassingly parallelizable structure. Within each tempering iteration,
likelihoods can be evaluated simultaneously. In most programming languages, this kind of parallelism can be employed easily, for example, MATLAB’s parfor command. Finally, we have shown
that the sequential Monte Carlo methods can be used for very large DSGE models. Indeed, it is
on large complex distributions that returns to using an SMC algorithm over an MCMC algorithm
are highest.
