ABSTRACT
How sensitive are the earnings of top earners to business cycles? And, how does the business cycle
sensitivity of top earners vary by industry? We use a confidential dataset on earnings histories of US
males from the Social Security Administration. On average, individuals in the top 1% of the earnings
distribution are slightly more cyclical than the population average. But there are large differences
across sectors: Top earners in Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate (FIRE) and Construction face
substantial business cycle volatility, whereas those in Services (who make up 40% of individuals
in the top 1 percent) have earnings that are less cyclical than the average worker.

How Risky Are Recessions for Top Earners?
Fatih Guvenen, Greg Kaplan and Jae Song⇤
January 22, 2014

This paper addresses two open questions about the fortunes of top earners:
1. How sensitive are the earnings of top earners to business cycle fluctuations?
2. How does the business cycle sensitivity of top earners vary by industry?
To answer these questions, we use a confidential panel data set on earnings histories from
the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA), which allows us to follow workers’ earnings
over the business cycle. Our approach is to identify individuals who were in the top
1 percent of the earnings distribution just prior to the economy entering a recession or
boom. We ask how the evolution of these workers’ subsequent earnings compares with the
evolution of workers’ earnings from the rest of the population, and how these di↵erences
vary by sector.1
Despite the extensive recent attention given to top earners, surprisingly little is known
about the answers to these two questions, largely due to the lack of detailed panel data
with sufficient coverage at the top of the earnings distribution. Panel data is necessary
to study the dynamics inherent in these questions. However, most survey based datasets
under-represent very high earners, because of the extremely low response rate of such
individuals to surveys, and because of top-coding in many frequently used panel datasets.

In this paper, we look only at the top 1 percent. Guvenen et al. (2014) contains a more detailed
analysis that also covers the top 0.1 percent and 0.01 percent.

The contribution of this paper is to use a very large panel dataset from administrative
sources with non-top-coded earnings information that allows us to track top earners from
1978 to 2011, covering three full expansions and four full recessions.
In the absence of panel data on top earners, earlier papers have characterized the
evolution of top income shares. This is accomplished by computing the share of aggregate
income earned by the top 1 percent of individuals year by year, and documenting the
changes in this quantity over time. Of course, the group of top earners is not comprised of
the same individuals in every year. Hence compositional changes can confound inference.
Parker and Vissing-Jorgensen (2010) and Saez (2013) are two prominent examples of
this approach. Both of these papers conclude that the income shares of top earnings groups
have been highly cyclical since the 1980s. While these are interesting findings, they do
not directly answer the questions raised above, because of the lack of a panel dimension
to the analyses, and the lack of disaggregated data by sector.2 Bakija et al. (2012) study
the occupations of top earners using tax data on earnings and self-reported occupations.
They have annual data on occupation from 2001 to 2005, but only have four data points
between 1979 to 2000. Our data contain annual information on industry and earnings for
all years between 1978 and 2011. Finally, Guvenen et al. (2013) have documented that
individuals who enter a recession in the top 1 and 0.1 percent of the income distribution
face the largest earnings drops of any group in the population. But they have not analyzed
the data by sectors as is done here.

1

Data

We use confidential data on individual earnings histories from SSA records. Our basic
source of information is the Master Earnings File (MEF), a panel dataset covering all US
individuals with a Social Security Number. We work with a 10 percent representative
sample of U.S. males from the MEF, covering the period 1978 to 2011. Earnings data
come directly from individual W-2 forms (Box 1) and, as such, include wages and salaries,
bonuses, and exercised stock options. In addition, the dataset contains demographic characteristics, such as date of birth, sex, and race.
2

Parker and Vissing-Jorgensen (2010) provide some decompositions by broad sectors, but only using
data from the Current Population Survey, which is top-coded and under-samples the very rich. They also
undertake an analysis using panel data, but only for Canada.

2

Earnings data in the MEF are not capped, which is crucial for our analysis of top
earners, but also means that the MEF contains a small number of extremely high earnings observations each year (> $100, 000, 000). To avoid such outliers unduly influencing
average facts about the top 1 percent, we cap (winsorize) observations above the 99.999th
percentile. We deflate nominal earnings using the Personal Consumption Expenditure
deflator, and express all quantities in 2005 dollars.3
Our analysis is distinguished from previous analyses of top earners by the panel dimension of the data. We exploit this panel dimension in two ways. First, we define membership
of the top 1 percent based on average earnings over a 5-year window, rather than earnings in a single year. We thus focus on those individuals who are persistent top earners,
and exclude individuals whose high earnings are a one-o↵ event. This distinction is important given the relatively high probabilities of transiting in and out of the annual top
1 percent documented in Kopczuk et al. (2010), Auten et al. (2013) and Guvenen et al.
(2014). Second, and more importantly, we compute statistics on the earnings growth of
individuals in the top 1 percent, rather than the growth in average earnings of the top 1
percent. This distinction is important because of compositional changes that arise due to
the aforementioned instability of membership of this group.
Specifically, we construct a rolling panel, whereby for a given year t, we select a group
of individuals that satisfy certain selection criteria during years t 5 to t 1. We then
compute the earnings growth experienced by these individuals between years t and t+5. An
individual is eligible for inclusion in the rolling panel for year t if he satisfies the following
two conditions in three of the previous five years, including year t 1: (i) he must be
between the ages of 25 and 60; and (ii) his earnings must satisfy a minimum threshold.4
We compute the average earnings from t 5 to t 1 for all such eligible workers, and assign
each individual to either the top 1 percent or bottom 99 percent based on their position
1pc
= 1 if individual i is in the top 1 percent
in this distribution of average earnings. Let Di,t
in year t according to this definition. The t 5 to t 1 average earnings thresholds for
membership of the top 1 percent ranged from a minimum of around $217,000 in t = 1984
to a maximum of around $348,000 in t = 2005.
3

Our construction of the 10 percent sample follows Guvenen et al. (2013). That paper also contains
further information about the MEF and justification for the sample selection choices made in this paper.
4
The minimum threshold is equal to one-half of the legal minimum wage times 520 hours (13 weeks at
40 hours per week). A condition of this kind is standard in the literature on income dynamics. However,
because the main focus of our analysis are top earners, varying this minimum threshold is unlikely to a↵ect
our results.

Our dataset also contains information on the sector in which an individual works.
These data come from linking Employer Identification Numbers, which are available on
the W-2 form, to 5-digit standard industry classification (SIC) codes. We aggregate these
to standard 1-digit industry classifications. Where an individual has multiple employers,
we use the one that corresponds to the highest income W-2. For each rolling panel at year
t, we assign individuals to sectors based on their SIC code in year t 1, which is the most
recent year of the 5-year period used to construct average earnings.

Cyclicality of top earners

Organizing the data in this way allows us to follow the subsequent fortunes of individuals,
conditional on their recent history, across recessions and expansions. Figure 1 illustrates
these fluctuations by plotting the average 5-year forward change in log earnings, conditional
on membership of either the top 1 percent or bottom 99 percent based on average earnings

When computing statistics for the bottom 99 percent, we use a 2 percent random subsample of this
group, since the full sample is very large, consisting of around 5 million individuals per year.

Notes: Statistics are averages from 1983-2006. Statistics for individuals with missing
SICs are not reported. Statistics for individuals with SIC codes 100-999, 9100-9899 and
4300-4399 (agriculture and government) are not reported due to small number of individuals
in top 1%. Hence reported percentages do not add to 100%.

the interpretation of this graph, consider, for example, the 1989 data point on the red
dashed line. This shows that the average income change between 1989 and 1994, for
individuals who were in the top 1 percent of the distribution of average earnings from 1983
to 1988, was a drop of just over 10 log points.
Figure 1 reveals substantial business cycle fluctuations in average 5-year earnings
growth for both the top 1 percent and bottom 99 percent. However, in contrast with
the findings using cross-sectional data in Parker and Vissing-Jorgensen (2010) and Saez
(2013), the panel data evidence, as illustrated in Figure 1, suggests that the two groups
experience similarly sized cyclical fluctuations in earnings growth. More concretely, the
time-series standard deviation of average earnings growth is somewhat larger for the top 1
percent than the bottom 99 percent (0.095 versus 0.062), but as we shall see, this additional
volatility is unrelated to the business cycle.
To measure the cyclicality of earnings more formally, we regress individual log earnings
growth from t to t + 5 on a constant, a linear time trend and the growth in GDP between

5

t and t + 5.

We estimate equation (1) separately for the top 1 percent (k = 1) and the bottom 99
percent (k = 0). The coefficient measures the cyclicality of average earnings growth,
the constant ↵ is included to capture potential mean reversion (which is expected, since
we are conditioning on a group of individuals with very high earnings in the previous five
years), and the coefficient captures a potential time trend in earnings growth.
For the period t = 1983 . . . 2006 we estimate a loading factor for the top 1 percent of
ˆ = 1.55, with a standard error of 0.32. For the bottom 99 percent the corresponding
estimate is ˆ = 1.31, with a standard error of 0.14. Thus for the two groups as a whole,
we find a very similar sensitivity of earnings to aggregate fluctuations. Moreover, the
explained variation from this regression is R2 = 0.60 for the top 1 percent and R2 = 0.82
for the bottom 99 percent. Hence the additional earnings volatility of top earners is
largely uncorrelated with the business cycle. In summary, on average individuals in the
top one percent do not experience much larger cyclical earnings fluctuations than the rest
of the population. The next section shows that the same is not true once we condition on
particular industries.

Cyclicality of top earners by sector

Summary statistics by sector are reported in Table 2. First, observe that the largest
group in the top 1 percent is Services (39.4%), consistent with its representation in the
overall economy (23.3%). Second, observe that the most over-represented group among
top earners is FIRE (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate) which makes up 18.2% of the top
1 percent and only 5.3% of the bottom 99 percent. Third, there is substantial variation
in average earnings across industries even within the top 1 percent: workers in FIRE have
the highest average annual earnings (around $630,000) while those in Construction have
the lowest (around $500,000). Table 2 also reports the time-series standard deviation of
average 5-year earnings growth by sector. There are substantial di↵erences in earnings
growth volatility across sectors: Construction is the most volatile sector while Services is
the least volatile sector.

Figure 2: Mean 5-year earnings growth of individuals in top 1 percent, by sector

A large part of these di↵erences in volatility across sectors pertains to business cycle
fluctuations. We illustrate this feature of the data graphically in Figure 3 by reproducing Figure 1 separately for top earners in each sector j. That is, the lines in Figure 3

= 1, SIC = j . The left panel, Figure 3, shows average earnings
growth for the four sectors with the highest volatility, while the right panel, Figure 3, shows
the three sectors with the least volatility. The figure illustrates clearly that top earners in
Construction, Manufacturing, Transportation and Utilities, and FIRE experience substantial changes of fortunes from recessions to expansions, while top earners in Services and
Wholesale Trade show only modest fluctuations. Comparing Figure 1 and Figure 3 reveals
that top earners in Services (nearly 40 percent of all top earners) exhibit fluctuations that
are roughly the same size as the average earner in the bottom 99 percent.
To explore the di↵erences in business cycle fluctuations across sectors more formally, we
re-estimate the regression in (1) separately by sector and top earner status. Allowing for
di↵erential time trends across sectors is important because of the secular trends in earnings
growth that have been observed during this time period., e.g. top earners in FIRE have
seen accelerating earnings growth relative to the average, while Manufacturing has seen
decelerating growth.
These findings, which form the key results of the paper, are summarized in Table 3.
The first three columns report the estimates ˆ together with standard errors and the
associated R2 from regression (1), for the top 1 percent of earners. The second three
columns report the analogous statistics for the bottom 99 percent. The key findings are
neatly illustrated by considering the two largest sectors among the top 1 percent: Services

and FIRE. Services, which contains the biggest proportion of top earners, displays the least
amount of systematic risk for top earners, with an estimated loading factor of ˆ = 0.61 and
an explained variation of only R2 = 0.36. Top earners in FIRE, on the hand, experience
extremely cyclical earnings growth: the loading factor is ˆ = 3.63 and the explained
variation is R2 = 0.85. Moreover, aside from FIRE and Construction, the remaining
sectors have very low explained variation for workers in the top 1 percent.
For workers in the bottom 99 percent, the biggest sector, Services, is also the least
cyclical, with an estimated loading factor of ˆ = 1.03 and an explained variation of only
R2 = 0.72 (but note that Service workers in the top 1 percent have less cyclical earnings
growth than service workers in the bottom 99 percent). Like the top 1 percent, Construction workers have the most cyclical earnings growth among workers in the bottom
99 percent ( ˆ = 2.58, R2 = 0.90). But unlike top earners, workers in the bottom 99% in
FIRE do not have particularly cyclical earnings growth.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest large di↵erences across sectors in the cyclicality of earnings growth.
While average earnings growth (across workers in all sectors) is very similar for individuals
in the top 1 percent compared with the bottom 99 percent, there are striking di↵erences
across sectors. Most of the cyclicality of top earners is driven by those in FIRE, while
FIRE workers in the rest of the distribution do not have particularly cyclical earnings.
Services on the hand, the largest sector, is actually less cyclical in the top 1 percent than
in the bulk of the earnings distribution.
The analysis in this paper has only scratched the surface of issues surrounding the
nature of the business cycle risk faced by top earners. Guvenen et al. (2014) use an even
larger sample from the same panel dataset that allows them to study individuals in the
top 0.1% and 0.01%, as well as to distinguish between several two-digit SIC industries: for
example, separating health services (mostly doctors), and professional services (lawyers,
engineers, accountants, various research services, etc) from the broad category of services,
as well as distinguishing between finance, insurance and real estate. Such distinction is
important, especially because these categories occupy much larger shares of the top 1%
and 0.1% than their population share. This larger dataset also enables further exploitation
of the panel dimension to study membership in the top percentiles of average earnings over
horizons that are longer than 5 years, such as lifetime earnings.
