ABSTRACT
Using National Youth Survey (NYS) data, we examine the relationship of current criminal activity
and past arrests using an ordered probit model with unobserved heterogeneity. Past arrests raise
current criminal activity only for the non-criminal type, while past criminal experience raises current
criminal activity for both types. Also, the age crime profile peaks at age 18 for non-criminal type
individuals, but for criminal type individuals, it continues to rise with age. Past research indicates
that age arrest profiles rise till age 18 and then fall for both types, suggesting lower apprehension
rates for criminal type individuals.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we use data from the National Youth Survey (NYS) to investigate
the determinants of the criminal behavior of young men.1 Our work is, we believe, the
first in the economics literature to incorporate three important factors affecting criminal
behavior: arrests, criminal experience, and observed and unobserved individual
characteristics such as family and social background and unobserved types. Past work has
only looked at subsets of these and hence could have obtained misleading results.
Distinguishing between these factors is of vital importance in designing effective anticrime policies. For example, allowing for more than one type is important. Suppose that
there are two types: the criminal type and the non-criminal type. The criminal type
commits crimes repeatedly while the non-criminal type does not. If past arrests result in
more crimes today by the non-criminal type, but not by the criminal type, then policies
that are tough on first time offenders could well be self-defeating!
NYS contains self-reported data on arrests as well as on crimes committed. We
use this information to identify the arrest effect and the criminal experience effect. We
use the term “arrest effect” to mean the overall effect of past arrests on individuals’
criminal behavior. The arrest effect has at least three components: the perceived
probability effect, the stigma effect and the criminal training effect.
Upon arrest, an individual may update his perceived probability of being caught
and punished upward, which makes him less likely to commit a crime in the future (i.e.,
the perceived probability effect, see Lochner, (2000)). Arrests and convictions cause
stigma, which may decrease earnings in legitimate activities, making crime more
attractive. Also, when incarcerated, he cannot commit crimes, though he may learn
criminal skills from fellow prisoners and thus accumulate criminal training (see Bayer,

Pintoff and Posen, (2004)). The former would reduce current crimes (and arrests) while
the latter would raise current crimes (and reduce current arrests).
Similarly, the “experience effect” captures the overall effect of past criminal
experience on current criminal behavior, other things being constant. The experience
effect has at least two components: the learning by doing effect and the effect via
perceived probability. An individual could become more skilled at committing crimes
with experience, i.e., leaning by doing. In addition, an individual may update his
perceived probability of arrest downwards: more past crimes, given arrests, would tend to
reduce the perceived probability of arrest, and increase crimes today.
In order to capture observed heterogeneity, we include as explanatory variables
information on schooling, employment and parental background. In order to allow for
unobserved heterogeneities, we incorporate random effects on the constant term. In
addition, we allow slope coefficient estimates to differ across the two unobserved types.
The estimation results indicate that the two types could be interpreted as the non-criminal
type and the criminal type.
It is well known that individuals differ in their criminal behavior: most people do
not commit crimes regularly, whereas a small fraction of the population commits most of
the crimes. One of our is to see how the criminal types differ from the non-criminal types,
not only in terms of the overall likelihood of committing crimes, but also in terms of the
effect of past arrests and past criminal experience on current criminal behavior. However,
it is inappropriate to simply assign types to individuals based on their arrest or criminal
history. We infer individual’s types by estimating a mixture model that allows us to have
different parameters for the two types. The behavioral parameters for the two types as

well as the posterior probability (given characteristics) that an individual is of one type or
of the other should be determined so as to best replicate the data.2 This is basically the
approach taken here in using the “mixture” model. In Section 5, we show that we do need
to take this approach, as the results from taking the simplistic approach are very different
from those when the model is appropriately specified.
We use an ordered probit setting. This allows for the fact that most people do not
commit any crimes. In addition, it improves over the simple probit setting as it also
utilizes information about the number of crimes committed.3
Our estimation results are summarized as follows: The criminal experience effect
is significantly positive for the non-criminal type, both before age 18 and after. It is
positive for the criminal type as well, though insignificant after age 18. Importantly, the
arrest effect turns out to be quite different between the two types. In particular, after age
18, the arrest effect for the criminal type is significantly negative, while it is significantly
positive for the non-criminal type.4 We also find that controlling for other variables, the
crime rate increases with age even after age 18 for the criminal type, whereas it decreases
with age after age 18 for the non-criminal type.5 This result highlights the importance of
using data on criminal activity and not just on arrests. In Imai and Krishna (2004), for
example, it is shown that arrests of the criminal type fall off even faster than those of the
non-criminal type after the age of 18. Our results indicate that this should not be
interpreted as evidence that their criminal activity follows a similar path, rather, that
criminal types become better at evading arrest after 18. In terms of policy, our results
suggest that tough on crime policy may be more effective for repeat offenders since
arrests seem to serve as a deterrent for criminal types.

There has been some recent work by economists analyzing criminal behavior
using individual level data. Viscusi (1986) uses cross sectional data to argue that criminal
behavior responds to economic incentives. Tauchen, Witte and Griesinger (1994) use the
Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study panel and run a probit (with random effects) of arrests
on past arrests and other variables including police spending. They find that past arrests
have a positive coefficient and police spending has a negative coefficient.
Self-reported criminal activity data is used by Grogger (1998), Lochner (2004)
and Mocan and Rees (1999). Using a probit approach, Grogger (1998) shows that
criminal activity rises when labor market conditions worsen. Lochner (2004) uses both
arrest and criminal activity data to show that education reduces arrests as well as criminal
activities. Mocan and Rees (1999) estimate criminal choice equations using an ordered
probit approach. Their focus is on the possible determinants of crime including
employment conditions that vary across regions. However, none of them look at the
effect of past criminal activity or arrests on current crime.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the
ordered probit model of crime and the estimation strategy. In Section 3, we discuss our
data. In Section 4, we present the estimation results and their implications. In Section 5,
we conclude by outlining some work in progress that extends our model in various
directions.

2. Model Specification
To capture the relationship between crimes, arrests and unobserved heterogeneity
we estimate a standard ordered probit model of criminal choice: for individual i at time t,
the following equation describes his criminal behavior:

yit* = bi + ϕ0 + xit′ ϕ1 + ε it

(1)

where

ε it ~ Φ (⋅) .
We assume the error term is i.i.d. and its distribution function is standard normal. bi is
the mean-zero random effects on the constant term and ϕ0 is the constant term. xit is a
vector of time-varying explanatory variables of individual i at time t. The elements of this
vector include age, past arrest records,6 number of past crimes committed7 (for criminal
experience), total past years of schooling, total past years of work, etc. yit* is the
unobserved latent index variable representing the propensity to commit crimes. We only
have limited information on the number of crimes individual i committed in period t: we
know the category into which this number falls but not the exact count. Let yit denote
this category. We specify that
yit = 1 (commit no crime) if yit* ≤ µ1 ,
y it = 2 (commit 1 to 2 crimes) if µ1 < yit* ≤ µ 2 ,
y it = 3 (commit 3 to 11 crimes) if µ 2 < yit* ≤ µ3 ,
y it = 4 (commit 12 to 30 crimes) if µ3 < yit* ≤ µ 4 ,
y it = 5 (commit 31 crimes or more) if µ 4 < yit* .
We define µ0 = −∞ and µ5 = +∞ , and normalize µ1 to be 0 for identification.
We allow for unobserved heterogeneities both in the constant term as well as the
other coefficients. 8 First, we allow for two types with potentially different parameters so
that their behavior could differ.9 Second, we allow for the mean-zero random effects on
the constant term, as done by Tauchen et al. (1994) among others. Even though we
incorporate some observable characteristics of individuals that affect their chances of

committing a crime, there may be many other individual characteristics that matter, but
are unobservable to the econometrician. Including random effects in the constant term is
a way of capturing such time-invariant effects, at least partially.10
As discussed above, in our estimation model, past criminal records are
endogenous. Since the schooling and work choice are not explicitly modeled, both past
years of schooling and past years of work are assumed to be strictly exogenous. 11
Because of the poor quality of schooling and work data in NYS, we decided to leave the
estimation of a more formal model of schooling, work and crime choice for future
research. We also assumed that given past criminal history, past arrests are exogenous.
We believe that this assumption is reasonable since individuals do not directly choose the
number of arrests.12
When lagged criminal experience enters into the right hand side, we face a
problem known as the Initial Conditions Problem (see Heckman (1981)). Since initial
criminal experience and the random intercept term are correlated, the coefficient estimate
of the lagged experience is biased. We use a method similar to Wooldridge (2000) to deal
with this problem. That is, we can rewrite the random effects term as follows:

bi = θ 0 + θ1CEi 0 + θ 2WE i + θ 3 HE i + xi′

4

+ ηi

where CEi 0 is the initial period criminal experience, WE i is the time-average of the
number of years of employment after age 18, and HE i is the time-average of the highest
grade attended by the individual. xi is a vector of time-constant covariates such as family
background. η i is assumed to be mean-zero normally distributed and uncorrelated with
y i*0 . Then, equation (1) can be rewritten as follows:

yit* = (θ 0 + ϕ0 ) + θ1CEi 0 + θ 2WE i + θ 3 HE i + xi′

4

+ xit′ ϕ1 + ηi + ε it

(2)

where (θ 0 + ϕ 0 ) is the constant term to be estimated, and η i is the new random effects
term.
Incorporating heterogeneities in the ordered probit estimation involves integration
over both the latent error term ε , the random effect of the constant term η , and the type
heterogeneity. We adopt a Bayesian approach suggested by Albert and Chib (1993). We
choose to do so for computational reasons. With the Bayesian approach, integration over
the latent error term and the random effect term can be done straightforwardly as part of
the simulation process of the posterior distribution. This is known as the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Geweke, Keane and Runkle (1997), using the
multinomial probit model as an example, argue that the Bayesian MCMC method works
well compared to other standard estimation techniques, such as Simulated Maximum
Likelihood or Simulated Method of Moments. The major difficulty in Bayesian
estimation has been computing the posterior distribution if its dimension, which equals
the number of parameters, 43 in our case, is very high. Using the MCMC procedure,
more specifically, the Gibbs sampler algorithm, allows us to simulate the posterior
distribution in manageable blocks.
The parameters that need to be estimated are those in equation (2) which
determines yit* . This includes the random intercept term ηi . We denote the vector of
other coefficients to be

. They include constant terms, the coefficients for the past

arrests and past criminal experience, and coefficients for the observed individual
characteristics described in Table 2 to Table 4. We allow

to take on different values

depending on the type. The other parameters we estimate are the threshold parameters γ 2
to γ 4 and the variance of the random effects denoted d . We also estimate the prior type
probability λ which can roughly be interpreted as the proportion of criminal type
individuals in the population.
The estimation procedures are described in detail in Appendix 1. We set up the
priors for d and

3. Data
The National Youth Survey (NYS) we use contains a random sample of 1,725
individuals from ages 11 to 17 in 1976. Individuals were surveyed annually from 1976 to
1980; then again in 1983 and 1986.
From 76 to 80 as well as for 83 and 86, we have data on the number of crimes
committed in that year. But in 1981, 1982, and 1984, 1985, the exact numbers of crimes
committed are not available. Instead, we only know in which of the four categories (0, 12, 3-11, 12-) their criminal activity falls, which was part of the reason for using the
ordered probit approach. In order to construct the past criminal activity variable, we

impute the number of crimes committed in each category to be the lower end point.14
Moreover, only the criminal activity of last three years is used. This is a simple way to
model the depreciation of past criminal activities. The results seem to be robust to using
other specifications.
The data on arrests are limited in that total arrests in the past two years are
available only for years 1983 and 1986. Total arrests to date are recorded for 1980 and
1983. To fill in the missing arrest records, we evenly spread the incremental arrests over
the intervening years.
We only use the male sample in the data as males commit most of the crimes.
There are 918 male individuals in the data set. We exclude individuals who have
incomplete responses for arrests in 1980, 1983, or 1986 since we cannot recover the
arrest variable for these individuals from the data. The total number of male individuals
in the data set is 1725, Furthermore, we exclude individuals who have incomplete
responses for crimes committed on 1978, 1979 and 1980 since for these individuals, we
cannot recover the criminal experience variable from the data. Having done this gives us
a final sample of 612 individuals.
Table 1-4 show some sample statistics and Table 5 contains information on the
types of crimes included. Figure 1 depicts the age mean crime profile which differs from
the conventional age arrest profile. It has a peak at age 13, and is flat thereafter. This is
surprising since most age arrest profiles in the literature have a pronounced peak around
age 18. Figure 2 depicts the modified age mean crime profile, where for each age, the top
3% of the individuals, i.e., those who committed the most crimes, are removed. After
such outlier removal, the age crime mean profile is a smooth function of age, and has a

peak around age 18. It resembles the conventional age arrest profiles more than the
original profile suggesting that the self-reported crime data has some outliers. We also
plot the percentage of individuals at each age who committed at least one crime during
that year. From the age crime participation profile in Figure 3, we can see that in one
year, about 30% of the individuals commit crimes at least once. We also can see that the
variation of the age-crime participation profile is smaller than that of the age mean crime
profile. This is because the variation in numbers of crimes committed is ignored if we
only focus on the discrete choice of whether the person committed crime at least once or
not during one year. That is exactly why we use an ordered probit model for estimation.

4. Estimation Results
Table 6 (Model 1) contains the parameter estimates as well as the standard errors.
The two unobserved types are called type 1 and type 2. We term these the non-criminal
type and the criminal type respectively as type 1 commits fewer crimes at all ages. The
probability of the criminal type is estimated to be about 0.12. This is similar to the
estimate found in Imai and Krishna (2004).
Other things constant, the crime rate for the non-criminal type increases with age
before age 18 and decreases with age after age 18. For the criminal type, however, the
crime rate increases with age even after age 18. Imai and Krishna’s results (2004) suggest
that the arrest rate for the criminal type decreases more rapidly with age than for the noncriminal type. However, this need not imply that the age crime profile does the same if
the criminal type becomes better at avoiding arrests after the age 18. Our results show
that this is indeed the case, at least in the National Youth Survey data. In Figure 4, we
plot the age mean crime profiles of the non-criminal type and the criminal type. This

confirms the results that for the criminal type, crimes increase after the age 18, especially
after the age 22.
The criminal experience effect (i.e., the coefficient on the crimes committed over
the last 3 years) is positive both for the non-criminal type and the criminal type. Before
age 18, the criminal experience effect is larger for the criminal type than for the noncriminal type.
The arrest effect (i.e., the coefficient on the past arrest record) is positive and
significant for the non-criminal type both before and after age 18. It is negative for the
criminal type, though only significant after age 18. One interpretation of this is that the
non-criminal type would be more stigmatized upon arrest than the criminal type. Thus,
the stigma and training effect discussed earlier could dominate the perceived probability
effect for non-criminal type individuals but would not do so for criminal type individuals.
If a criminal type individual already has a bad reputation, then it is not surprising that his
stigma effect is smaller.15
The coefficient on schooling (the highest grade attended by the individual) is
positive for the non-criminal type and is negative though not significant for the criminal
type. This does not imply that schooling increases crime, because current schooling is not
included in the variables. It could be that past schooling is negatively correlated with
current schooling and current schooling decreases crime. The coefficients on employment
(the number of years of employment after age 18) are insignificantly different from zero.
To fully understand the effect of schooling and employment, we need to estimate a model
of criminal behavior where schooling and employment choices are endogenous.16

Coefficients on the family backgrounds for both types have the expected sign,
parents’ presence in the home has the expected effect, even though not significant, in that
it reduces criminal activity. Also note that for both types, individuals whose parents
graduated from high school seem to commit fewer crimes, perhaps as the families are
better off and so the children have more to lose. Other coefficients have expected signs or
are not significantly different from zero.
It is worth noting that it is not straightforward to interpret coefficients on the timeconstant covariates such as race and family background. That is because they also contain
the Wooldridge initial conditions corrections term. In other words, even if the coefficient
of a race dummy is positive, it is unclear whether the individual belonging to the race is
more likely to commit a crime or to have high criminal experience prior to the sample
period, leading to high crimes in the future. Therefore, one should not over emphasize the
differences in the estimates across types though they have reasonable signs for the most
part.
In Table 6 (Model 2), we report the estimation results in which, as is often done in
the crime literature, we include past arrests, but do not include past crimes committed, as
explanatory variables. Notice both before and after 18, the arrest coefficients for the noncriminal type are positive though not always significant. When criminal activity is
included, both coefficients are positive and significant. The arrest coefficients for the
criminal type are negative both before and after 18 but are not significant. When criminal
activity is included, both coefficients are negative and the coefficient after age 18 is
significant.

We conclude that adding past criminal activity to the regressors increases the
significance of the arrest coefficients, and in some cases, dramatically changes their
magnitude, for example, for the non-criminal type and for the criminal type after age 18.
This is likely due to the omitted variable bias. The direction of the bias is less clear
because past crimes are likely to be correlated not only to past arrests, but also to age, and
random effects term. Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning that the precision of the
random effects term is larger for the original specification ( d −1 = 1.086) than that for the
specification which does not include past criminal experience in the regressor
( d −1 = 0.455) . This suggests that part of criminal behavior attributed to past crimes
should be attributed to unobserved heterogeneities at the individual level
Table 7 shows the marginal effects of the coefficient estimates for our model, i.e.,
the effect of a marginal change of a regressor on the probability of zero crimes, crimes
less than or equal to 2, crimes less than or equal to 11, and crimes less than or equal to 30.
The marginal effect measures the change in probability due to a small change in the
variables.17 It is evaluated by setting the parameters at the posterior mean and variables at
the sample mean. Hence, being black raises the probability (by .13) of committing no
crimes. All the signs and magnitudes of the marginal effects make sense and are
consistent with the parameter estimates. For example, for the non-criminal type, a unit
increase in age decreases the probability of not committing any crimes before age 18
by .0293 but increases it after age 18 by .0061. Recall that the coefficient for age for the
non-criminal type was positive below age 18 and negative after 18. Before and after the
age 18, an increase in log arrests and log past crimes reduces the probability of no crimes
committed.

For the criminal type, an increase in age reduces the probability of committing
crimes less than or equal to 30 times a year, i.e., an increase in age increases the
probability of committing crimes more than 30 times a year. This is not so for the noncriminal type. Table 7 indicates that for the non-criminal type, most of the changes occur
at the margin of criminal participation. This is because most of the non-criminal types do
not commit any crimes. On the other hand, for the criminal type, most of the changes
occur around the probability of committing 11 to 30 crimes, as can be seen from the fact
that changes occur disproportionately at the cumulative probability of committing less
than 30 crimes. This again comes from the fact that criminal type typically commits more
than 10 crimes per year. It is interesting to see clear differences between the non-criminal
and the criminal types with respect to which range of the numbers of crimes committed
the marginal change has the most impact on.
In addition to our original model, we estimate a model without incorporating
unobserved types and compare it to the original model. Table 8 provides the estimation
results. The after age 18 coefficient on past arrests in this model is estimated in between
the coefficient for the criminal type and that for the non-criminal type in our original
model. Thus, it is essential for an empirical model of crime to allow unobserved types to
have different coefficients. In this respect, past literature that does not allow for
unobserved types can fail to suggest effective policies as discussed in the introduction.
In Table 9, we report the proportions of crimes that the non-criminal type and the
criminal type commit. Here, we classified an individual as a non-criminal type if the
posterior probability of being a non-criminal type is more than 50%. As can be seen,
criminal type individuals tend to commit crimes like carrying hidden weapons and selling

drugs. Even though drug related crimes also occur for the non-criminal type, they are
much less likely, while minor crimes such as stealing less than $50 are more common.
Finally, we look at the results of sample splitting, the simplistic approach to
dealing with heterogeneity. Specifically, we split the sample into the two groups. We
ordered individuals by the number of crimes committed and estimated the model for the
top 12 percent and the remaining 88 separately. We chose the 12 percent break based
upon the type probability of criminals being 12 percent in the mixture model. Table 10
provides the estimation results. The results show that coefficients on arrests and crimes
tend not to be significant: only the criminal human capital coefficient for the low end of
the sample is significant. This is because the assignment of types is based on total
criminal activities, which is endogenous. For example, individuals who, despite the low
past criminal experience, belong to the criminal type must have high current and future
crimes, resulting in negative bias on the past crime coefficients for the criminal type. This
confirms the hazards of such a simplistic approach.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we have focused on the determinants of criminal activity as opposed
to arrests. Our main results are threefold.
First, there is reason to believe that criminal type individuals and non-criminal
type individuals behave differently. Not allowing for such differences leads to misleading
results: as shown, the estimates when we do not allow for two types differ considerably
from those when we do. Second, we show that criminal behavior depends not just on past
arrests, but also on past criminal experience. Neglecting this tends to bias the effect of
arrests on crime upwards as discussed earlier. Third, we show that it is inappropriate to

look at the age arrest profile and assume it reflects the age crime profile. The age arrest
profile differs from the age crime profile and differs across types as well. Just because the
arrest rate for the criminal type decreases more rapidly with age than that for the noncriminal type does not mean that criminal behavior does.
Our work has a number of policy implications. First, since criminal types differ
from non-criminal types in their behavior, policies towards them should differ. Recall
that the coefficient on arrests for criminal type is negative and significant after the age 18
and positive and significant for the non-criminal type. This suggests that arrests increase
criminal behavior for the non-criminal type, but not for the criminal type. Thus, tough on
crime policies for the criminal type individuals look more attractive than for the noncriminal type individuals, suggesting leniency towards first time offenders and harshness
towards repeat offenders, such as the “three strikes and you are out” one might be on the
right track.
Second, our work suggests that habitual criminals seem to be able to evade
arrests. The age crime profile of criminal type individuals is increasing in age while their
age arrest profile is decreasing after 18. There seems to be a significant criminal human
capital effect for both types. This suggests that targeting police activity towards known
criminals might be useful.
To get a better understanding of the factors affecting criminal behavior, we need
to consider at least two additional elements, namely past convictions and the perceived
probability of punishment. If we had the latter, then the coefficient on criminal activity
would more clearly capture criminal human capital. Moreover, the coefficient on arrests

would better capture any stigma associated with arrests alone. Finally, the coefficient on
conviction would capture both learned criminal behavior and stigma due to conviction.
It would also be worthwhile constructing and estimating the determinants of
arrests, conviction as well as the perceived probability of punishment18 simultaneously
with that of criminal choice. Such a setup would help cast light on questions like: is there
a race bias in arrests and convictions? Are habitual criminals indeed able to better evade
arrest? If the coefficient on past criminal activity for criminal types in the arrest equation
is negative, this might suggest habitual criminals are indeed better at evading arrests. If
the coefficient on past arrests for them is positive, a “rap sheet effect” is suggested, i.e.,
known criminals are more likely to be caught.

Appendix 1: Estimation Procedure
The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is straight forward
and avoids the difficulties inherent in dealing with posterior distributions which are
complex high dimensional functions of the parameters. It simulates the posterior
distribution by drawing sequentially from a series of conditional distributions of lower
dimension which converge in distribution to the posterior distribution.
We also include a simulation step termed "Data Augmentation". This simulates
the latent variable yit* which is a latent variable and not observable. Once the latent
variable yit* is drawn, the Ordered Probit estimation becomes a straightforward Bayesian
linear regression estimation.
Let us denote Z ∈ {1,2} to be the type of the individual. The variables that need to
be simulated are: (Z , y * ,η , β , d −1 , λ , γ ) . y and X are given in the data. The MCMC
algorithm in this case is a chain of the following steps:
Set the initial values [Z ( 0 ) , y *( 0) ,η ( 0) , β ( 0) , d −1( 0) , λ( 0 ) , γ ( 0 ) ]
STEP 1: Draw Z (1) given [y *(0 ) ,η ( 0) , β ( 0) , d −1( 0 ) , λ( 0 ) , γ ( 0) , y, X ]
STEP 2: Draw y *(1) given [Z (1) ,η ( 0) , β ( 0) , d −1( 0) , λ( 0) , γ ( 0) , y, X ]
STEP 3: Draw η (1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) , β ( 0) , d −1( 0 ) , λ( 0 ) , γ ( 0 ) , y, X ]
STEP 4: Draw β (1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , d −1( 0) , λ( 0) , γ ( 0) , y, X ]
STEP 5: Draw d −1(1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , β (1) , λ( 0) , γ ( 0) , y, X ]
STEP 6: Draw λ(1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , β (1) , d −1(1) , γ ( 0 ) , y , X ]
STEP 7: Draw γ (1) given [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , β (1) , d −1(1) , λ(1) , y, X ]

Repeat Step 1 to Step 7 with the new initial values [Z (1) , y *(1) ,η (1) , β (1) , d −1(1) , λ(1) , γ (1) ].
Below, we discuss in more details the simulation algorithms of each conditional draws.
1. Draw [z i | y * ,η , β , d −1 , λ , γ , y, X ]
Let P (i, s ) be the probability that individual i is of type s for s = 1,2. Recall that

λs denotes the type probability. Hence,

∏ f (y ,η | z = s, β , d , λ ,γ , y )λ
∏ f (y ,η | z = m, β , d , λ ,γ , y )λ

P(i, s ) =

)

f yit* | zi = s,ηi , β , d −1 , λ , γ , y ∝ exp −

)

)

1 ηi2
2 d (s)

The full conditional density of zi is:
S
s =1

I ( zi = s ) P(i, s )

which is used to draw the value for zi .
2. Draw [y it | Z ,η , β , d −1 , λ , γ , y, X ]
The full conditional density of yit* is as follows. Given the draw for the type just
obtained, and the remainder of the parameters and data, we obtain the conditional density
function of yit* to be

(

)(

)

I γ j −1 < yit* ≤ γ j φ yit* | ηi + xit′ β ( s ) ,1

where I (⋅) is an indicator function and φ ( yit* | ηi + xit′ β ( s ) ,1) is a normal distribution with
mean ηi + xit′ β (s ) and a variance of unity. Thus, draw yit* from the normal distribution,

(

)

N ηi + xit′ β (s ) ,1 truncated at the left by γ j −1 and to the right by γ j .

3. Draw [η i | Z , y * , β , d −1 , λ , γ , y, X ]:
The full conditional density of ηi is

(

φ ηi | 0, d ( s )

)∏ φ (y
T

*
it

)

| ηi + xit′ β ( s ) ,1

t =1

(

)

Thus, draw ηi from N η̂i , dˆi where

( )

dˆi−1 = d ( s )

−1

− xit′ β ( s )

)

+T .

4. Draw [β ( s ) | Z , y * ,η , d −1 , λ , γ , y, X ] :
The full conditional density of β ( s ) is the same as the posterior density for the
regression parameter in the normal linear model
Y **( s ) = X ( s ) β ( s ) + ε ( s ) , ε ( s ) ~ N n ( s )T (0, I )

when the types are separated and where n( s ) denotes the number of individuals of type s
which defines the dimension of the above normal distribution. X ( s ) and Y ( s ) are the
stacked matrix and vector for the separated types. That is

(

X ( s ) = xi′1 1 ,

(

Y **( s ) = yi*1*1 ,

, xi′1T ,
, yi*1*T ,

, xi′n ( s ) 1 ,
, yi*n*( s ) ,

, xi′n ( s )T

)′

, yi*n*( s )T

)′

where the new variable yit** is just yit* displaced by the random term, i.e.,

yit** = yit* − ηi .

If β (s ) is assigned the proper conjugate N k (β 0( s ) , B0( s ) ) prior, then the we draw β (s ) from

(

)

N k βˆ ( s ) , Bˆ ( s ) where

(

) (B

(

)

βˆ ( s ) = B0( s ) + X ( s )′ X ( s )
Bˆ ( s ) = B0( s ) + X ( s )′ X ( s )

[

]

5. Draw (d ) | Z , y * ,η , β , λ , γ , y, X :
−1

The full conditional density of (d ) is
−1

(

f w (d ) | v 0 , q 0
−1

)∏ φ (η
i: z i = s

Thus, we draw (d

)

from

I (z i = s ) + ν 0 , (q0 ) +
−1

N

6. Draw [λ | Z , y * ,η , d −1 , β , γ , y, X ] :
The full conditional density of is

(

f D λ | {α s }s=1
S

)∏
N

S

I ( zi = s )λ( s )

i =1 s =1

Thus, we sample λ from the Dirichlet distribution
D(α1 + n1 ,

, α s + ns )

where ni denotes the number of individuals of type i, i.e.,
N

I ( z i = s ) = ns

i =1

7. Draw [γ j | Z , y * ,η , d −1 , β , λ , y, X ] :

For a formal derivation of this see Albert and Chib (1993). Since the draws of
y * contain all the information available about γ j , the conditional density of γ j is uniform

on the following interval:

[max{max{y

*
it

]

: y it = j}, γ j −1 }, min {min{y it* : y it = j + 1}, γ j +1 } .

For estimation, we set up the prior distributions as follows: d ~ INVWISH (3,0.1) ,
β ~ N (0, I ) for type 1 and type 2, and (λ1 , λ 2 ) ~ D(1,1) . We run 20, 000 MCMC iterations.

Convergence is achieved within the first 3000 iterations. The first 5,000 iterations are
used as burn-in samples, and the next 20,000 iterations are used for computing the
posterior distributions.

Our work is empirical rather than theoretical. In addition to classic work, such as Becker (1968), there has

been some interesting recent work on some of the issues we examine. For example, Burdett, Lagos and
Wright (2004) develop a search model where unemployment, income inequality and crime are all
endogenously determined and look at the effects of several policies to combat crime. mrohoro lu, Merlo
and Rupert (2004) calibrate a general equilibrium model of crime to see what accounts for the fall in crime
in the 90’s.
2

For a more detailed discussion, see Heckman and Singer (1984).

3

A Tobit setting also uses this information. A count data setting does so as well and in addition respects the

fact that only integral numbers of crimes occur. Our choice of the ordered probit setting is based on data
considerations. In some years, information on criminal activity is not complete: only the range of criminal
activity is given.
4

If we estimate the ordered probit without allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in coefficients, we find a

positive effect of arrests on criminal activity since non-criminal types dominate.
5

Note the contrast to all existing work that uses age arrest data and finds the age arrest profile peaks at

around 18.
6

Past arrest record variable is: log(number of past arrests + 1) .

7

Past crimes committed variable is: log(number of past crimes committed + 1) .

8

The state dependence effect of past criminal experience on current criminal behavior is separately

identified from the individual heterogeneity through the timing of past crimes committed. See Chay and
Hyslop (2004) for more detailed discussions on identification.
9

Since packaged programs cannot deal with this, we had to write the required program.

10

It is tempting to use fixed effects in combination with a mixture model so that one need not assume strict

exogeneity of education and work as done here. However, at present we are unaware of the existence of
this technique.
11

Lochner (2004) empirically investigates the joint relationship between schooling, work and crime.

12

Notice that this assumption will give us some bias if the arrest probability depends on the individual

unobserved characteristics.
13

Subscripts on the density function denote the dimension of the random variables.

14

We could have alternatively used the mean number in each category, but this rescaling would create

problems at the upper end since some individuals commit many crimes inordinately affecting the mean. All
the crime data in the tables below is based on this imputation.
15

This is consistent with the work of Waldfogel (1994) who looks at the effect of past convictions on

current wages. He finds that decreases in wage are more substantial for individuals in jobs that require
credibility than in jobs that do not. If non-criminal type individuals are in jobs that require relatively more
credibility compared to criminal type individuals, then our finding that the non-criminal type is more
stigmatized is consistent with his results.
16

Lochner (1999) estimated a simple dynamic lifecycle model where individuals jointly choose schooling,

work and crime
17

The formula for the marginal effect is similar to that for the probit model. That is, the marginal effect of

the probability of the crime category being less than or equal to j is,

(

)

∂prob( y ≤ j | x = x )
= φ x 'β − µ j β ,
∂x

where φ is the density function of standard normal distribution, ( β , µ j ) is the posterior mean of the

parameter estimates and x is the sample mean of variables.
18

The perceived probability of punishment is not available and only that of arrest and the former has to be

estimated as part of the model.
