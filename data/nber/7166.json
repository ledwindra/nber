    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents the first attempt to estimate the benefits of reducing crime using the contingent-valuation (CV) method.  We focus on gun violence, a crime of growing policy concern in America.  Our data come from a national survey in which we ask respondents referendum-type questions that elicit their willingness-to-pay (WTP) to reduce gun violence by 30 percent. We estimate that the public's WTP to reduce gun violence by 30 percent equals $23.8 billion, or $750,000 per injury.  Our estimate implies a statistical value of life ($4.05 to $6.25 million) that is quite consistent with those derived from other methods.\n\n",
