An Empirical Analysis of Primary and Secondary Pharmaceutical Patents in Chile

ABSTRACT
We analyze the patent filing strategies of foreign pharmaceutical companies in Chile distinguishing
between “primary” (active ingredient) and “secondary” patents (patents on modified compounds, formulations,
dosages, particular medical uses etc.). There is prior evidence that secondary patents are used by pharmaceutical
originator companies in the U.S. and Europe to extend patent protection on drugs in length and breadth.
Using a novel dataset that comprises all drugs registered in Chile between 1991 and 2010 as well as
the corresponding patents and trademarks, we find evidence that foreign originator companies pursue
similar strategies in Chile. We find a primary to secondary patents ratio of 1:4 at the drug-level which
is comparable to the available evidence for Europe; most secondary patents are filed over several years
following the original primary patent and after the protected active ingredient has obtained market
approval in Chile. This points toward effective patent term extensions through secondary patents. Secondary
patents dominate “older” therapeutic classes like anti-ulcer and anti-depressants. In contrast, newer
areas like anti-virals and anti-neoplastics (anti-cancer) have a much larger share of primary patents.

I. Introduction
Historically, pharmaceutical patents are among the most controversially debated issues with regard
to intellectual property (IP) protection, especially in developing countries. During the negotiations of
the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, pharmaceutical
product patents represented one of the most divisive issues, being opposed by developing countries
because of concerns that stronger patent protection would hinder access to drugs and prevent the
development of a domestic pharmaceutical industry. The TRIPS agreement forced developing
country members of the WTO to grant patents with a statutory lifetime of 20-years from the patent
application also to pharmaceutical compounds. Almost two decades after TRIPS, the empirical
evidence on its effect on developing countries is at best mixed (Arora et al., 2009, 2011; Chaudhuri
et al., 2006; Goldberg, 2010).
Despite the strengthening of IP protection brought about by TRIPS, some developing countries
continue to apply a more restrictive approach than developed countries to the granting of
pharmaceutical patents. While TRIPS requires the availability of patent protection for processes as
well as products in “all fields of technology” (TRIPS Article 27.1), the agreement provides countries
with substantial freedom to define the standards of patentability. Some developing countries, most
prominently India (Section 3(d) of India’s Amended Patents Act of 2005), have used this freedom to
restrict the granting of so-called secondary pharmaceutical patents. As opposed to primary patents
which protect an active ingredient directly, secondary patents protect a range of chemicals related to
an active ingredient (such as crystalline forms of the original compound), methods of use,
formulations, dosages, etc. Other developing countries, such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa,
are currently debating new legislation that would emulate India’s approach to restricting the
patentability of secondary patents.
In developing countries, secondary patents may have played particularly important a role for
multinational originator companies during the years following the introduction of pharmaceutical
patents. When developing countries began to allow the granting of pharmaceutical product patents,
in many instances originator companies were unable to obtain patent protection for drugs that had
already been patented abroad. In Chile, for example, pharmaceutical patents were introduced in
1991, but pharmaceutical drugs that had been patented abroad before the 1991 law came into effect
were expressly not patentable. This may have created strong incentives for originator companies to
rely on new secondary patents instead.

2

The sparse, available evidence on secondary patents, which focuses on the U.S. and the European
Union (EU) (see Section II below), offers some evidence on the use of secondary patents by
originator companies. Empirical and anecdotal evidence suggests that pharmaceutical originator
companies use secondary patents extensively in those markets. There is also some evidence that
secondary patents can be used to extend patent protection on a given drug in length and breadth
and it may create legal uncertainty over the scope of patent protection of a drug. That said,
secondary patents can be used to protect genuine follow-on innovation, although distinguishing
strategic use of secondary patents from their use to protect follow-on innovation is very difficult and
may not even be feasible when such patents serve both purposes.
Despite the widespread use of secondary patents and the contentious policy debate, there is little
evidence on the use of primary and secondary patents in developing countries. Our objective in this
paper is to shed light on the use of primary and secondary patents by multinational originator
companies in Chile and to gauge their effect on creating and maintaining exclusivity.
From a data point of view, studying this question is challenging because it requires not only a
distinction between primary and secondary patents, but also a mapping of patents to active
ingredients and the corresponding pharmaceutical products. Linking patents to active ingredients is
an enormous challenge because there is usually no explicit mention in the patent claims of the active
ingredient contained by a drug (where drugs can contain multiple active ingredients). We create a
new dataset that addresses this problem in three ways. First, we rely on the Orange Book of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to identify U.S. patents on the compounds registered in
Chile. We then construct patent families for these U.S. patents and verify whether there are any
Chilean equivalents. Similarly, we undertake the same exercise using the Merck Index, which
provides information on patents worldwide. Second, we use a dataset created by the Chilean patent
office (INAPI) that contains the compound-patent mapping for all new compounds registered in
Chile between 2005 and 2010. All of these matches are based on patent applications, whether
granted or not. Third, we asked experts in pharmaceutical patents in Chile to match directly the
remaining set of all granted Chilean patents to the complete list of drugs registered with the Chilean
health authorities. This means that we attempted to match all granted Chilean patents to drugs,
either directly or through any of the other approaches, although most of the patents do not match,
as we show below. Unfortunately, for cost reasons, we were unable to search the remaining patent
applications for matches to registered drugs, but based on our earlier match rates, we expect there to
be very few of these.
3

Because companies can obtain competitive advantage also through brand recognition, we also match
the pharmaceutical product-level data with trademark data. The mapping of drugs and trademarks is
more straightforward than that of drugs and patents. The pharmaceutical product data provides the
names under which drugs are marketed, which we search for in the relevant classes in our trademark
database.
For the matching of patents and trademarks, we rely on a dataset that contains the universe of
patent and trademark applications filed with the Chilean patent office (INAPI) between 1991 and
2010 (see Abud et al., 2013). The pharmaceutical product data comes from the National Public
Health institute (ISP). In Chile, all pharmaceutical products that are to be sold on the domestic
market have to be registered with the institute. It maintains a database that links all registered drugs
in Chile to the pharmaceutical compounds that they contain.
Our study contributes to the sparse empirical literature on the use of secondary patents, in particular
by foreign multinationals. It offers in particular for the first time empirical evidence on the use of
secondary patents in a developing country.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the distinction between
primary and secondary patents and briefly reviews the corresponding existing empirical evidence.
Section III provides background information on the relevant regulatory framework in Chile. Section
IV describes the data and Section V our main results. Section VI offers a few concluding
observations.

II. Primary and secondary patents
In the pharmaceutical industry, patents are usually filed already during the research phase in the
development of a new drug. These early patents are filed to protect potential active ingredients that
form the basis of the new drug. Since the early stages of drug development are characterized by an
enormous amount of uncertainty (the European Commission (2009) suggests that 1 in 5,000-10,000
test active ingredients results in a successful drug), early patent filings reflect this, in that many of
these filings will either not be pursued, or if granted, will never be related to a marketed drug.
Patents on active ingredients are referred to as primary patents. In later phases of the drug
development, patents are filed on other aspects of active ingredients such as different dosage forms,
formulations, production methods etc. These patents are referred to as secondary patents.
Secondary patents also emerge from changes to formulations and dosages or applications in new
4

therapeutic classes, discovered during clinical trials. Hutchins (2003b) reports that the usual filing
strategy is to file many and broad primary patent applications and then to surround them with
secondary patent applications.
A critical issue regarding secondary patents is whether they protect genuine follow-on innovation or
whether they represent primarily a form of strategic patenting (although these two may not
necessarily be mutually exclusive). There is little controversy about the innovation associated with
new active ingredients. However, new uses of existing active ingredients in new therapeutic areas,
new formulations, new modes of delivery, new combinations of known active ingredients etc. are
sometimes regarded as incremental innovation. In this case, secondary patents represent a way of
incentivizing and protecting potentially valuable follow-on innovation. This may be particularly
valuable for generics producers that want to develop proprietary drugs by modifying existing active
ingredients as a lower risk strategy. For example, consider a new formulation that allows
administering an active ingredient in form of a temperature-stable pill instead of a temperaturesensitive soft-gel version (Amin and Kesselheim, 2012). It is clear that the pill has no added
therapeutic benefit over the soft-gel version; at the same time the pill represents an improvement
over the soft-gel in terms of ease of drug storage and administration. On the other hand, secondary
patents may also be used to extend the time of market exclusivity and to maintain or even expand
the market that the product covers during market exclusivity. These objectives can be supported by
specific patenting strategies, in particular the creation of patent fences and clusters. According to
Burdon and Sloper (2003), “a key element of any life cycle management strategy is to extend patent
protection beyond the basic patent term for as long as possible by filing secondary patents which are
effective to keep generics off the market.”
The scarce available evidence on secondary patents suggests that secondary patents are pervasive
and that they seem to be used overwhelmingly as a strategic tool. For example, the European
Commission found in its 2009 pharmaceutical sector inquiry a primary to secondary patent ratio of
1:7 (EU Commission, 2009: 164). This ratio is higher for pending than granted patents (1:13 vs. 1:5),
which suggests that a large number of secondary patent filings are not granted, presumably because
they do not meet the statutory patentability requirements or because they are not pursued by the
applicant, having served their purpose of increasing uncertainty. The inquiry shows that 57% of
secondary patent filings protect formulations, 7% devices, 7% combinations of known active
ingredients, 5% polymorphic forms, 4% salts, and the remaining 20% are accounted by a range of
claims, such as hydrates or solvates (EU Commission, 2009: Table 20). The study also reveals that if
the validity of an originator’s patent is challenged either through post-grant opposition or an
5

invalidation action in court, the majority of secondary patents is invalidated as a result (or their
claims restricted) (EU Commission, 2009: 191). Kapczynski et al. (2012) conduct a similar study for
the U.S. They look specifically at patenting associated with 342 new active ingredients approved by
the U.S. FDA between 1991 and 2005. They find that around 50% of drugs are protected by
secondary patents. There is an increase in the share of drugs with secondary patents over time
whereas the share of drugs protected by primary patents remains constant. This filing pattern was
also found by Sternitzke (2013) who studies the patenting behavior of companies that market
Phosphodiesterase Type 5 inhibitors (for the treatment of erectile dysfunction). He also finds that
the originator companies included in his study, Pfizer, Bayer and Ely Lilly, file a large amount of
secondary patents during later stages of the life-cycle of a drug. This is suggestive of the fact that
secondary patents are filed later in the life cycle of a drug to extend the patent life. In fact, the data
for the U.S. by Kapczynski et al. (2012) reveals that compound patents are filed before FDA
approval whereas secondary patents are filed mostly after approval. The authors estimate that
secondary patents generate between 4-5 years of additional patent life on top of compound patents
associated with a drug. The mean masks considerable variation. For example, Amin and Kesselheim
(2012) found for their case study of two HIV drugs that secondary patents extend patent protection
up to 12 years beyond the lifetime of the original primary patents. Although this number might
overstate the effective extension of a drug’s patent protection because Amin and Kesselheim include
patent applications (as opposed to grants) as well as granted patents not listed in the Orange Book
(which may be a lot less effective in preventing generic entry). Another example is Sanofi Aventis’s
ARAVA arthritis drug in Australia. Sanofi Aventis effectively extended exclusivity by 10 years
through secondary patents (Sanofi-Aventis Australia Pty Ltd v Apotex Pty Ltd (No.3) [2011] FCA
346). Other examples of blockbuster drugs are GlaxoSmithKline’s antidepressant Paxil or Pfizer’s
cholesterol-lowering Lipitor. In both cases, secondary patents extend patent protection by several
years relative to the original compound patents (Hutchins, 2003a, 2003b). It is, therefore, not
surprising that the available evidence indicates a positive correlation between the number of
secondary patents for a given drug and higher sales.
An important element in the filing strategy of secondary patents is the creation of legal uncertainty.
For example, in their study of HIV drugs Amin and Kesselheim (2012) found overlapping patent
claims for a number of formulation patents. They also show that some of the formulation patents
protect variations of known excipients (for example on new flavors such as peppermint or vanilla),
or combinations of known excipients. According to their assessment, these patents are likely invalid.
Burdon and Sloper (2003) report the case of AstraZeneca’s Prilosec. While courts in the U.S. upheld
secondary patents that AstraZeneca had filed to extend the time of patent protection on Prilosec,
6

the Patents Court in the U.K. invalidated the same formulation patents. This case illustrates that the
question of validity of granted secondary patents is particularly unclear. Hemphill and Sampat (2012)
even conclude from their analysis of patent challenges by generics companies in the U.S. that
challenges target secondary patents and are thus mostly used to restrain attempts by originator
companies to extend patent terms beyond the original active ingredient patents through secondary
patents.

III. Regulatory framework
Registration of pharmaceutical products
Any drug marketed in Chile has to be registered with the Public Health Institute (ISP) – a
government agency (Decree of the Health Ministry No. 1876 from 1995). The same rules apply
regardless of whether the drug is imported or locally produced. Registration of new drugs with the
ISP takes on average between 6 and 18 months. Registration fees are moderate (around US$2,300)
and registrations have to be renewed after five years.
If a drug has already been registered on the ISP register, a company that wants to register a generic
version can rely on the studies submitted for the first registration as proof of safety and efficacy
provided the period of data exclusivity has expired. Also, since July 2008 (Resolution No. 3225/08),
the ISP started requiring proof of bioequivalence for products that contain certain active ingredients.
The number of affected active ingredients remained small during the period that we study (up to
2010), but has increased substantially since 2011 (see http://www.ispch.cl/medicamentosbioequivalentes). For these products, the second party to register a drug has to submit studies of
bioequivalence. However, because most drugs are still exempt from proving bioequivalence, most
generics do not necessarily satisfy bioequivalence despite being pharmaceutically equivalent.
Patent protection is irrelevant for registration at the ISP. In contrast to the U.S. FDA for example,
in Chile patent information concerning a new drug is neither requested nor verified when marketing
approval is granted.
Apart from patent protection, the regulatory system in Chile also offers additional means for
achieving exclusivity for new drugs. Data related to the safety and efficacy of new chemical entities
provided for approval of new chemical entities is granted five-year exclusivity since 2005 (see also
below), in cases where protection is requested by the applicant and granted by the ISP. This means
that generics companies cannot refer to the data when applying for approval of a drug.
7

Patents
Pharmaceutical drugs became patentable in Chile in 1991 through Law 19.039. The law offers patent
protection for both products and processes and initially provided a statutory patent life of 15 years
from the date the patent was granted, regardless of subject matter. The law excluded, however, all
patents that had been applied for anywhere else in the world before the law came into force.
Although the law still offered a way to obtain patent protection in Chile even if a patent had been
granted in another jurisdiction before Law 19.039 entered into force (Law 19.039, Article 39),
pharmaceutical patents were specifically exempted from this provision (Law 19.039 Transitional
Provisions, Article 1).
Law 19.039 was amended several times during the period that we study (up to 2010): in 2005 by Law
19.996 and in 2007 by Law 20.160 (Law 17.336 in 2010 did not affect the patents contained in our
sample.). The amendments brought Chile’s IP legal framework inline with TRIPS (taking advantage
of the 10-year transition period for developing countries under TRIPS) and Chile’s obligations under
FTAs with the U.S. and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Apart from a general
extension of the patent term from 15 years from the date the patent was granted to 20 years from
the application date, the most relevant changes affecting specifically pharmaceutical patents are the
introduction of supplementary patent protection due to delays in the granting of a patent or the
sanitary registration (Law 20.160, Article 53), the 5-year data exclusivity for new active ingredients
mentioned above (Law 19.996, Article 89), a Bolar exemption (Law 20.160, Article 49), a softening
of restrictions on second use patents (Law 19.996, Article 37e), and international exhaustion of
patent rights (Law 19.996, Article 49) which effectively legalized parallel imports as long as the
products were marketed abroad by the patent holder (or with the patent holder’s consent).
Finally, Chile joined the PCT system in 2009, which facilitates the international filing of patents.
Although Chile’s accession to the PCT is likely to have had some effect on patent filings by foreign
pharmaceutical companies in Chile, the change occurred in June 2009, which means it does not
affect patent filings observed in our dataset.

IV. Data description
To construct a dataset that combines patents and trademarks at the product level, we rely on a
dataset that contains the universe of patents and trademarks filed with the Chilean patent office

8

since 1991. This includes all patent and trademark applications by domestic as well as foreign
entities, regardless of whether or not they have been granted.
To map patents to pharmaceutical products, we use the pharmaceutical registration data available at
the ISP. The institute maintains a database that links all registered drugs in Chile to the
pharmaceutical compounds that they contain. The database also contains additional information on
the drug (e.g. when it was registered), the owner of the drug, whether the drug is produced
domestically or abroad. We use the bridge between compounds and drugs contained in ISP’s
database to link patents and trademarks at the product-level. Patents are linked to active ingredients
whereas trademarks are linked to drug names. The link between patents and drugs represents a
challenge as there is usually no explicit mention of the specific compounds in patent claims. Patents
use the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) classification to identify
compounds whereas drugs rely on WHO’s INN (International Nonproprietary Name). Although
compounds are usually described by a Markush structure in the patent, the same structure comprises
often many functionally equivalent active ingredients; only the combination of specific examples
provided in the patent and the Markush structure reveals the specific active ingredient protected by
the patent (see the Online Data Appendix for details).
We address this problem in three ways. First, we use a dataset compiled by INAPI that contains the
compound-patent mapping for all new compounds registered with the ISP between 2005 and 2010.
The mapping was undertaken by patent examiners specialized in pharmaceutical patents. Second, for
all other compounds, we rely on the Orange Book of the U.S. FDA to identify U.S. patents on the
compounds registered in Chile. We then construct patent families for these U.S. patents and verify
whether there are any Chilean equivalents. Similarly, we undertake the same exercise using the
Merck Index, which provides information on patents worldwide. Third, we asked specialists in
pharmaceutical patents in Chile to match the remaining set of granted Chilean patents (nearly 3,000
patents) to our list of ISP products directly. As noted earlier, this leaves a large number of Chilean
patent applications that neither matched to the Orange Book or Merck Index nor were granted that
we were unable to search, but we expect that the matches to drugs in this set of patents will be very
small in number.
The mapping between drugs and trademarks is more straightforward as the ISP database provides
the names under which drugs are marketed, which we use to search for these drug names in our
trademark database. In addition to matching drug names, we also match the names of all companies
in the ISP database with the trademark register. Especially in the case of generics companies,
9

individual drugs may not be trademarked, but the name of the company – which presumably
appears on the packaging – will be.
The Online Data Appendix describes the data construction in more detail and Table 1 gives a
summary of our patent-trademark match to the ISP register. Of 12,116 unique products registered at
the ISP, 3,709 match to at least one Chilean patent, whereas 9,273 match to at least one Chilean
trademark. After cleaning and translation of the active ingredients (including some standardization
of names), there are far fewer active ingredients than products, as one might have expected. Of the
2,630 distinct active ingredients (many of which are common chemical compounds, that is, generics
– for example vitamins), 322 match to at least one Chilean patent (504 distinct patents) and 2,332
match at to at least one Chilean trademark (10,461 distinct trademarks). Overall 82 per cent of the
products and 91 per cent of the active ingredients are associated with some form of IP protection,
more often trademark than patent.

Figure 1 shows the time trends for the unique product-active ingredient combinations. There is a
marked increase in the share using patents during the mid-1990s. Also the share relying only on
trademarks increases substantially beginning the second half of the 1990s.

When we examine the ownership of this IP, we see striking differences in the regional patterns.
Figure 2 shows the share of trademark and patent filings coming from domestic and foreign entities
in Chile, by date of the corresponding ISP registration. Almost all the patent filings are by entities
based in Europe and the U.S., with the exception of a small increase in Chilean-origin filings during
the most recent period. The total share of Chilean-origin filings is less than two per cent of total
pharmaceutical patent filings, and none of these filings match to active ingredients in the ISP
registration data. In contrast, over half the trademark filings are by Chilean entities, with the other
half largely from Europe and the U.S. This pattern points to important differences in terms of the
type of drugs marketed by domestic and foreign entities. Foreign originator companies rely on
exclusivity through patent protection (in combination with trademark protection as shown in Table
3 below) whereas domestic companies compete (at least to some degree) through brand recognition
in the generics market.

VI. Results
Our main interest is in the use of secondary patents by foreign originator companies in Chile.
Collecting the relevant data for investigating this question is challenging. We rely on the
identification of our patents as primary or secondary that was done by internal and external patent
examiners at INAPI following the classification proposed by Kapczynski et al. (2012). Of the 504
Chilean pharmaceutical patents that match to our list of active ingredients, 113 (22%) were identified
as primary patents, with the remaining 78% being secondary. This ratio of 1:4 is comparable to the
ratio of 1:5 found for granted patents by the pharmaceutical sector inquiry of the European
Commission. If we look at all granted patents regardless of whether they have matched to a product
registered at the ISP, we find that there are more primary than secondary patents. This could simply
be the result of secondary patents facing a higher likelihood of rejection by the Chilean patent office
which would be consistent with the findings of the EU Commission discussed above. Hence this
does not necessarily mean that the ratio of primary to secondary patents is the same for patent
applications (pre-grant).
The 504 matched patents are associated with 322 of the 2,630 active ingredients. Of these active
ingredients, less than one third (101) have at least one primary patent. In about 88% of the cases
with a primary patent, a primary patent is the first patent on that ingredient; in the remaining cases,
there is a secondary patent preceding the primary patent.
Figures 3, 4, and 5 examine the patent-active ingredient match more closely. Figure 3 shows the
trends in ISP-matched pharmaceutical patent applications for the two types of patents separately for
12

the 1991-2010 period, by date of patent application. During the 1990s after the introduction of
pharmaceutical product patents, both types of applications increase but after 2005 there is
substantial decline, which may reflect the introduction of data protection (see Section III) and the
worldwide slowdown in the introduction of new pharmaceuticals.

Figures 4 and 5 focus only on the ISP registrations that contain a new active ingredient and use the
date of the ISP registration rather than the date of the patent application. Figure 4 counts unique
patent applications, showing the breakdown between primary and secondary patents by the date of
the first ISP registration containing an active ingredient that has been associated with the patent.
There are 316 such patents; the remaining patents are associated with later appearances of the same
active ingredient, because they are on compounds rather than single chemicals. Clearly there are
almost no primary patents associated with pre-1991 ISP registrations, as one would expect given the
absence of pharmaceutical product patentability. There are a number of secondary patents, however,
suggesting that new formulations or uses of older ISP-registered products were patented after 1991.

Figure 5 also counts only unique ISP registrations the first time an active ingredient appears. It
shows the share of these registrations that are covered by primary, secondary, or both types of
patents during six time periods. This figure also makes it clear that patent coverage of new drugs is
increasing, and that an increasing number of these drugs are covered by primary patents. Note that
there may be some truncation during the 2006-2010 period due to incomplete patent data (patent
applications that follow the ISP registration in the later years will be missing, implying an
undercount of secondary patents, in particular). In spite of the increase in patent coverage, it is still
the case that several hundred active ingredients registered at the ISP for the first time after the year
2000 are not associated with any Chilean patent applications. Many but not all of these ingredients
are new virus vaccines or new ingredients for over-the-counter preparations such as vitamin
compounds, etc.

To investigate the timing between a Chilean patent application and the first associated ISP
registration further, we computed the lag between the two and plotted the distributions for primary
and secondary patents in Figure 6. This figure clearly shows that the great majority (86%) of the
primary patents are applied for before the first time the associated ingredient is registered at the ISP.
In contrast, only 56% of the secondary patents are applied for before the initial ISP registration. A
nonparametric test of the difference between the two lag distributions yields a χ2(1) of 37.5 and is
highly significant. The median lag for primary patents is 6 years and for secondary patents it is 2
years. In a number of cases, the lags are over 5 years, which suggests delayed entry into the market.

Figure 7 looks at the number of patents that protect a given active ingredient. About 55% of the
active ingredients are protected by a single patent and 34% of active ingredients that are patent
protected are protected by 2 or 3 patents. Very few active ingredients are associated with a larger
number of patents. When we look at the breakdown into primary and secondary patents 72% of
active ingredients that are protected by a single patent are in fact protected by a secondary
patent. Among drugs that are protected by several patents, in most cases they are protected by
only secondary patents or a combination of primary and secondary patents.

Table 2 combines the data on trademark protection with the information on primary/secondary
patents. This provides additional insight into the IP strategies of foreign originator companies. The
table shows that nearly all active ingredients that are protected by a patent are also protected by a
trademark. This indicates that companies rely on a patent-trademark combination to achieve market
exclusivity. Moreover, there are no significant differences between active ingredients that are
protected by either primary or secondary patents. That said, it appears that active ingredients
protected by a combination of primary and secondary patents are even more likely to rely on both
trademark and patent protection.

To gauge the effect of secondary patents on potential patent term extensions, Figure 8 looks at the
lag between the application date of the first primary patent and that of the latest secondary patent by
active ingredient. The figure shows that in most cases the lag is positive, meaning the application for
secondary patent was filed after the primary patent, and in many cases this lag amounts to several
years. If the secondary patent offered exclusivity to some degree, Figure 8 would suggest that in
some cases, companies could gain a number of additional years of patent exclusivity through the
filing of secondary patents. The median number of possible additional years is four, which is
consistent with the numbers estimated by Kapczynski et al. (2012) for the United States. The active
ingredient with the longest lag (15 years) is Posaconazole, an anti-fungal for which a crystalline form
was patented in the United States 19 years after the original patent (see US patents 5278175 and
8435998).

Table 3 shows the number of primary and secondary patents associated with each therapeutic class
(the total number of entries in the table is 1,246 because there can be more than one class for a
given patent - see also Tables A-7-A-9 in the online appendix). The shares of primary patents vary
18

considerably: recall that product patents were not available in Chile before 1991. This means that
classes like anti-depressants and anti-ulcer (gastrointestinal agents) which had important patents
prior to that date are covered largely by secondary patents. In contrast, newer areas like anti-virals
and anti-neoplastics (anti-cancer) have a large share of primary patents.

One of way of assessing the importance of secondary patents for extending market exclusivity is to
analyze whether there are any differences in the use of secondary patents by type of patent owner –
in particular distinguishing between for-profit companies and not-for-profit research institutes and
universities. In Figure 9 we distinguish between these two types of assignees. The figure shows that
the share of secondary patents among patent-protected active ingredients is significantly larger for
19

companies than for universities/not-for-profit research institutes. There are only 5 secondary
patents that are assigned to universities and not-for-profit research institutes. However, with the
exception of one secondary patent which is assigned to the Wellcome Foundation, all other
secondary patents are co-assigned to universities/not-for-profit research institutes and private
companies. This suggests that secondary patents are almost exclusively used by private companies as
a tool to achieve exclusivity. That said, universities tend to focus on early stage research which is less
likely to lead to the filing of secondary patents. Taking a closer look at patenting companies, we find
that 76 out of 123 companies (62%) only file secondary patents whereas 25 companies (20%) only
file primary patents (22 companies file both types of patents).

VII. Conclusion
Our objective was to take a first look at patenting of pharmaceuticals in Chile, with a particular
focus on the distinction between primary and secondary patents. We provide a number of
descriptive findings that show that pharmaceutical patents associated with drugs that have received
market approval are almost exclusively the domain of foreign originator companies. Overall, we find
20

that only a subset of drugs with market approval is protected by patents, a much larger number of
products are protected by trademarks. We also find that foreign originator companies rely on a
patent-trademark combination whereas domestic companies rely only on trademarks. Nevertheless,
we also find a substantial number of ISP registrations that are not protected either by a patent or a
trademark. When we take a closer look at ISP registrations protected by patents, we find that the
majority are protected only by secondary patents (few active ingredients are protected by more than
1-3 patents). This is especially true before the change to the patent law in 1991, although it takes a
few years for number of primary patents to become significant. We also find that nearly all primary
patents on active ingredients were filed before a drug containing the active ingredient was registered
with the ISP. Secondary patents in contrast often follow with a lag of several years, that is, secondary
patents are often filed after primary patents and after a drug has been registered at the ISP. The
timing is also reflected in the fact that secondary patents dominate “older” therapeutic classes like
anti-ulcer and anti-depressants. In contrast, newer areas like anti-virals and anti-neoplastics (anticancer) have a much larger share of primary patents. Our data also reveal that secondary patents are
almost exclusively a tool used by private companies whereas universities and not-for-profit research
institutes concentrate on primary patent protection.
This study is only a first step towards a better understanding of pharmaceutical patents in Chile. We
have assembled a dataset that combines pharmaceutical products, active ingredients, patents,
trademarks, and information on the corresponding companies. These data enable us to substantially
deepen our understanding of the impact of patents on the pharmaceutical industry in Chile. Still, our
approach and data have a number of obvious limitations. Perhaps most importantly, we only
observe whether a drug has obtained market approval, but we have no information on actual
demand or prices. This limits our ability to account for the importance of different drugs other than
through their therapeutic classes.
We plan to extend this work to assess the impact that the combined use of primary and secondary
patents has had on the ability of Chilean companies to compete in the generics industry. Such
analysis could produce relevant insights for the current debate on secondary patents.

Data Appendix:
Our analysis is based on a linked database constructed from three separate sources:
1. The list of pharmaceutical products registered at the Chilean National Public Health
Institute (ISP).
2. A database of all patent applications filed with the Chilean Patent Office (INAPI) between
1991 and 2010.
3. A database of all trademark filings at INAPI between 1991 and 2010.
Constructing the linked database required matching the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical
products with the associated patent application(s) and matching the product names with the
associated trademark filing(s). In both cases there is no easy reliable way to do the matching and a
large part of it was done manually. We describe the data sources and the matching effort in more
detail in this appendix.
Description of the ISP database
Our data construction begins with a list of pharmaceutical products given to us by the National
Public Health Institute (ISP). In Chile, all pharmaceutical products that are to be sold on the
domestic market have to be registered with the ISP. The registration includes the name of the
product, the form and size in which it comes, the principal active ingredient, and the specific active
ingredient being registered. That is, a product may have one or more entries in the database
depending on whether it comes in multiple forms, or has multiple active ingredients. Because many
active ingredients are useful in several products, there are far fewer active ingredients listed than
there are products or ISP registration entries. In addition, the names of the same active ingredient
are sometimes given in differing ways, which required us to standardize the names by hand.5 We
obtained the ISP register in October 2012, which means it includes only products that have been
registered up to five years earlier or that had been renewed.
Between 1934 and 2012, there were 14,504 ISP registrations for 12,116 pharmaceutical products.6
Of these, 2,630 contained an active ingredient that had not yet appeared in an ISP registration.

5

E.g., pentahydrate recorded as 5-hydrate on occasion. Calcium spelled out or recorded as the Chemical symbol Ca.

6

439 (3%) of the registrations were missing the ISP registration date and are not included in these figures.

24

Figure A1 shows three time series: all ISP registrations, those where the name of a drug appeared for
the first time, and those where an active ingredient appeared for the first time. Until about 1975,
each registration contained a new product and active ingredient; after this date the series begin to
diverge and by the year 2000 the introduction of products with active ingredients that are new to the
Chilean market begins to decline.
Figure A2 shows a distribution of the number of active ingredients per product. Almost 70 per cent
of the products have only one active ingredient, and almost 90 per cent have 1 or 2. The products
with more than 5 active ingredients tend to be things like multi-vitamins and minerals or alternative
medicines. Figure A3 shows the distribution of the number of registrations associated with an active
ingredient. About 37 per cent are registered only once, but 5 generics (ibuprofen, paracetamol,
ascorbic acid, the antihistamine chlorphenamine maleate, and the decongestant pseudoephedrine)
are registered more than 200 times.

ISP registrants
The ISP database contains the names and addresses of organizations that are registering the product,
but they are not standardized.7 Our first step was to standardize the names by removing such things
at “LTD” and “S A”, but preserving the country associated with the name. This resulted in about
3,500 unique name-country combinations. These were examined by hand to correct misspellings and
further standardize the names. The resulting list contained 2,322 unique name-country
combinations. After cleaning, the largest number of companies associated with a single registration
was 18 (for products Plavix and Adenosine, with much the same list of international firms plus the
Chilean importers and quality control). The left hand panel of Table A1 gives the distribution of

these organizations across countries, and the right hand side gives the same thing weighted by the
number of times the organization appears in the registry.
Only 15 per cent of the organizations have a Chilean address, but 68 per cent of the entries are for a
Chilean organization. That is, the average number of ISP registrations for a Chilean firm is much
higher than for firms from other countries.8 Chile is followed in both lists by the U.S., Argentina,
Germany, and India. The presence of India suggests the importance of the generics market in Chile.

Note that almost all of the organization names are in fact firm names, with a few individuals and universities in addition.

28

One advantage of the ISP database is that it contains information on the role that each registrant
plays in the production and distribution of the drug being registered. In many cases a registrant will
perform more than one function, sometimes as many as five (packager, importer, distributor, quality
control, and manufacturer). This fact explains why there are 104,612 entries in the database but only
67,687 unique ISP id-firm-country combinations. Table A2 shows the distribution of the various
functions performed by the registrants, by broad geographical region (Chile, the rest of Latin
America, the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and the rest of the world). With a few minor exceptions, the
distribution looks reasonable: Chilean firms specialize in finished manufacturing, packaging,
importing, distributing, and quality control, whereas foreign firms manufacture, serve as the source
or licensor of the product, and occasionally package, especially if they are European or Latin
American firms.

As indicated in the introduction to this appendix, our main objectives in the data construction are
twofold: 1) to link pharmaceutical products to the patents that protect the active pharmaceutical
ingredients and processes embodied in the products; and 2) to link products to trademarks. The ISP
provides us with data that contains information on products and active ingredients, that is, we have
a database with all pharmaceutical products registered in Chile and the active ingredients that they
contain. The challenge then consists in (a) finding all patents that protect the active ingredients
29

contained in the products and in (b) linking trademarks to products and companies. We divide our
discussion below into these two challenges.

Finding and linking patents to active ingredients
We have data on all patent applications filed with the Chilean patent office (INAPI) between 1991
and 2010. This includes all patent filings by domestic as well as foreign entities. The objective is to
identify those patents that protect the active ingredients listed in ISP’s pharmaceutical product
database. We also attempt to identify patents that protect the processes used in the production of
the products, but this is more difficult because these cannot necessarily be identified directly from
our data sources.
Linking patents to active ingredients is difficult for the following reasons:
1) Active ingredients are registered at the ISP using the International Nonproprietary (INN)9
classification whereas patents rely on the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC)10 classification. These classifications differ substantially. For example,
the INN denomination for the active ingredient Imatinib is “imatinib mesilate” and its
IUPAC is “4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-N-(4-methyl-3-{[4-(pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-2yl]amino}phenyl)benzamide.”
2) While the ISP register lists the active ingredients that belong to a given pharmaceutical
product, patents may protect a family of different pharmaceutical ingredients related to the
active ingredient in question.11 This means that a single patent may protect several different
active ingredients. Specific ingredients covered by the patent can only be identified through
the examples given in the patent application.
3) A product registered at ISP can be associated with a number of different patents. Only
some of these patents protect the relevant active ingredient. This can occur for several

9 The INN is the official nonproprietary or generic name given to a pharmaceutical substance designated by the World Health
Organization (WHO).

This organization names new compounds according to the rules of organic chemistry.

This is due the “Markush” formula. This formula represents a group of compounds related with an active ingredient. These related
compounds are usually modifications of the original active ingredient.

reasons. First, other patents protect different forms of the active ingredient, related
ingredients, or for example the manufacturing process of the drug. Second, in the early
stages of the development of a new drug, producers commonly patent a large number of
molecules, formulations and compositions that have potential to be developed into new
active ingredients. This means while there can be a large number of patents related to the
eventually developed active ingredient, they need not all protect the ingredient. Third, it is
possible to patent the “second use” of a drug.
Mindful of these challenges, we proceed as follows. As a starting point, we use data compiled by
WIPO from information provided by INAPI that contain the active ingredient-patent mapping for
all active ingredients contained in new pharmaceutical products registered with ISP between 2005
and 2010. The mapping was undertaken by patent examiners specialized in pharmaceutical patents.
For all remaining products registered with the ISP we proceed as follows:
1) The ISP products are grouped by active ingredients. For example, focusing on the active
ingredients Imatinib and Drospirenone, we group thirteen ISP products under the active
ingredient Imatinib and thirty-three products under the active ingredient Drospirenone. For
the cases that a product has more than one active ingredient, we include the product in each
group of its active ingredients. For example, the product “Femelle Fol Comprimidos
Recubiertos” has three active ingredients: Drospirenone, Ethinyl Estradiol and
Levomefolate. Therefore, the drug will be part of three different groups, one for each active
ingredient.
2) Each active ingredient is translated from Spanish into English using online translators and
our own expertise.
3) Each active ingredient is searched in the Merck Index (MI). The MI contains the first filings
of patents on an active ingredient, which can be at any patent office around the world. This
provides us with the direct association between active ingredient and corresponding
patent(s). We search the priority dates, inventor names, title and abstract of the patent(s)
listed in the MI. For example, Imatinib has two patents in the MI: EP564409 and
US5521184 with priority date 03/04/1992. The inventor name for both patents is “Juerg
Zimmerman.”

31

4) The Orange Book (OB) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) is used to
identify U.S. patents on or related to the active ingredients of the products registered in
Chile. The OB provides the patent-active ingredient mapping for all drugs registered with
the USFDA, and patents filed with the USPTO. Patents may not only protect the active
ingredient directly but also other features of a registered drug. We search for each active
ingredient in the OB.12 If an active ingredient is found in the OB, we extract the
corresponding list of products that contain the active ingredient and the patents associated
with these products.13 We obtain priority dates, inventor names, title and abstract for the
USPTO patents identified through the OB. The main challenge is to determine whether the
patents found in this way protect the active ingredient or a related ingredient or process. For
example, we found two registered products in the FDA that contain Imatinib: Gleevec
100mg and Gleevec 400mg. Each product has the same four USPTO patents. One of the
four patents listed in the OB corresponds to the MI priority patent (US5521184), which
means this is the one that protects the active ingredient Imatinib. If the product has only a
single ingredient, it is likely that the other patents that do not protect the active ingredient
directly, but a modification, a related process, manufacturing method, a second use, or
treatment. If the product has several ingredients, the patents can also be associated with
other ingredients. To determine this, each patent has to be assessed individually. We do not
assess this directly, but rely on the assessment of the Chilean equivalent by patent examiners
specialized in pharmaceutical patents. So for example, the three other U.S. patents found in
the OB in the case of Imatinib (US6894051, US7544799 and US6958335) are indeed related
to Imatinib. The first two patents are a crystal modification of the active ingredient and the
third one is a treatment using Imatinib. This would only be relevant, however, if any of these
patents had a Chilean equivalent.
5) The WIPO-INAPI database is searched for Chilean equivalents of the patents found in the
MI and OB. We do this through inventor names, priority date, title and abstract of the
patents found in the MI and OB. The Chilean patents found in this way, where we
distinguish between the patents protecting directly the active ingredient and related patents,

The OB does not provide historical patent data, that is, if a patent expires or lapses at the USPTO, the patent is deleted from the
register. Bhaven Sampat provided historical records that allow us to correct this problem.

12

13 We could have also searched directly for the products contained in the ISP register, but going via active ingredients seems to be the
‘cleaner’ way of proceeding.

32

represent the patents that protect a given active ingredient and hence pharmaceutical
product. For example, in the case of Imatinib we did not find a Chilean equivalent for
US5521184 but we found an equivalent for US689405, a crystal modification of Imatinib
(CL199801692). In this way we create patent families related to each active ingredient and
pharmaceutical product.
In case we were unable to find an active ingredient in the MI or the OB, we link patents to
ingredients directly. However, this is not straightforward as explained above and was therefore done
by Chilean patent experts specialized in pharma patents. Due to the large number of pharmaceutical
patents and the extremely labor-intensive process of matching patents and pharmaceutical products,
we limited the direct match to the remaining set of unmatched granted pharmaceutical patents
(approximately 3,000 patents).14
The ISP database contains additional information on pharmaceutical products such as the
registration, expiration and renovation date, the owner of the drug, whether the drug is produced
domestically or abroad, and drug packaging information. The information on the owner of the drug
is especially useful for the patent-compound matching as it provides a possible cross-check with the
assignee names of patents.
The match between drug names on the ISP and these various patent data bases yielded 602 unique
Chilean patents: 463 from the Orange Book, 26 from the Merck Index, 44 from the WIPO-INAPI
match for 2005-2010, and 69 from the search of remaining granted patents. After cross-checking of
the matches by Chilean patent experts, this number was reduced to 504 unique Chilean patents
matched to 322 unique active ingredients from 4,304 ISP registrations. There are 619 unique patentactive ingredient combinations. Table A3 below shows a count of the number of ISP registrations
and the number of unique active ingredient names that are matched to no, one, two, etc. patents.
The drug and active ingredient with the largest number of associated Chilean patents (9) is
ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic. One third of the ISP registrations but only 12 per cent of the unique
active ingredients match to at least one patent. Only 3 per cent of the patents in the organic fine
chemistry, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical classes match to an active ingredient, but that is not

The search for additional matches to the ISP ingredients in these 3,000 granted patents yielded 69 patents (2%). Therefore the
remaining unsearched patent applications are unlikely to contain many additional matches, especially since they include a majority of
rejected or abandoned filings.

aquaculture.

In Table A4 we look at the patent-active ingredient match by the grant status of the patents. We
again restrict the Chilean patent database to those patents classified in ISIO 14 (organic fine
chemistry), 15 (biotechnology), and 16 (pharmaceutical). Only 6 of our matched patents lie outside
these classes and we have added these manually to the sample. In this table we show the match by
the patent status. Clearly granted patents are more likely to be matched (at 8%) and
abandoned/withdrawn patents are the least likely to be matched (<2%). However the overall match
rate is fairly low (3%).

Linking products to trademarks
The ISP database provides the names under which drugs are marketed as well as their owners and
potential licensees that might market products under their own name. We have all trademark filings
with INAPI for the period 1991-2010, which contains filings by both residents and non-residents.
To associate registered trademarks to pharmaceutical products, we search for product trademarks
associated with the drugs’ names as well as the owners as reported by ISP in INAPI´s trademark
database. Needless to say, this is a very complex process and the current data file by no means
exhausts the trademarks that might be associated with our products.
To give an idea of the difficulty, recall that there are about 12,000 pharmaceutical products in the
ISP database. The trademark database has about 780,000 registrations (averaging 2 registrations per
each distinct trademark), of which there are about 150,000 registrations in the NICE classes 3 (soaps
and cosmetics), 5 (pharmaceuticals, dietary, medical supplies), 10 (medical and surgical instruments),
and 44 (medical services & beauty care). About 50,000 of these registrations are renewals, leaving
100,00 unique trademarks. Matching even 12,000 names with 100,000 names requires an automated
approach. Our initial algorithm cleaned each name (product and trademark) for special characters
and did some standardization by removing frequently repeated words from the product name (e.g.
“acido” or “compuesto”). We then matched on the first word in each name. The result of this match
was examined for obvious errors, and those were removed. A manual search of the trademark
database using the remaining unmatched drug names was then performed, which added a few more
matches.

35

The resulting match contains 10,461 unique trademark registration numbers for 4,255 unique
trademarks. 9,273 of the 12,116 product names (76%) have been matched to at least one
trademark.15 There are 1,323 unique names of trademark owners. About half of the registrations are
renewals and the vast majority of the trademark names are from Nice class 5 (pharmaceuticals), as
shown in Table A5 below.

Table A6 shows the trademark status of the matched and unmatched patents. The majority (77%) of
trademark applications are granted and about 21% are rejected or abandoned. As in the case of
patents, pending and granted trademarks are much more likely to have been matched to a product in
our ISP dataset, although the share that matched is still rather low.

Multiple registrations correspond to the same trademark text: there are many renewals, and text that is the same even if the owner
and true trademark are different. So the statistics here may require more work.

Therapeutic classes
The final step in our data construction was to standardize the therapeutic classes attached to each
ISP registration. The raw data in the ISP register contained a total of 1,542 distinct therapeutic
classes. 248 (1.7 per cent) of the ISP registrations were missing the therapeutic class and we filled in
the missing information. The classes in the raw data do not follow a common structure and the
same classes may be labelled in different ways. In addition, each entry potentially contains multiple
therapeutic classes. We translated these classes and standardized them which included spelling
corrections, name harmonizations, and the grouping of related classes (for example we group
“antidepressant selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake” and “antidepressant”), yielding 594
standardized therapeutic classes. In a final step we match the cleaned and standardized therapeutic
classes to a hierarchical classification system maintained by www.drugs.com. This allows us to group
therapeutic classes under broad headers and to collapse our data into 19 broad therapeutic groups
consisting of 183 classes; we use these classifications for the analysis.
Table A7 shows the number of ISP registrations by broad therapeutic group and Table A8 shows
the number of registrations for the more detailed classes that have 100+ associated registrations. In
both cases, the numbers are weighted by the inverse of the number of classes attached to that
registration.16 Table A8 shows that many of the most common registrations are for products that are
“off-patent”, such as NSAIDs, vitamins, analgesics, penicillin, etc., as we expect. Finally Table A9
shows the distribution of products and active ingredients across therapeutic classes. Columns 1 and

16

There may be as many as 4 classes per registration, although most have only one or two.

37

3 of Table A9 show that 19 therapeutic classes account for over half the products between them,
with the remainder accounted for by the other 164 classes. The remaining columns (2 and 4) of
Table A9 show the number of active ingredients associated with each therapeutic class. The class
with the largest number of active ingredients is vitamins, which includes various homeopathic
remedies that tend to be mixtures containing a number of ingredients.
