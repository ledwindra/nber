I examine whether the likelihood of antitrust litigation is influenced by patent histories and R&D expenditures, after controlling for other firm-specific variables including size and likelihood of antitrust charges for medium and large firms.  Smaller firms with faster sales growth are also more likely to be charged with antitrust violations.\n\n",
