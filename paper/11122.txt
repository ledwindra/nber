ABSTRACT

We explore the consequences for asset pricing of admitting a bequest motive into an otherwise
standard overlapping generations model where agents trade equity and perpetual debt securities.
Prices of securities are seen to be approximately 50% higher in an economy with bequests as
compared to an otherwise identical one where bequests are absent. Robust estimates of the equity
premium are obtained in several cases where the desire to leave bequests is modest relative to the
desire for old age consumption.

1. Introduction

This paper explores the implications of bequests for the statistical pattern of
equilibrium stock and bond returns. It does so in the context of a “behavioral style”
model in which households make their consumption and savings decisions not only to
smooth consumption over their saving and dis-saving years, but also to provide for
“indirect consumption” in their old age in the form of inter-vivos transfers and bequests.
In this paper these two terms are used interchangeably, as the generality of our model
precludes distinguishing between them.1 We model the elderly as being motivated by a
well defined “joy of giving”.
There are two primary motivations for this study:
1. Over the next thirty years the “baby-boom” generation will grant to its heirs
many trillions of dollars of economic property, including a majority of the stock
market’s total capitalization. It is thus of interest to explore – in anticipation of the
aforementioned event – the implications of a model with an explicit bequest motive for
the profile of security prices and returns. We find that the explicit incorporation of
bequests – even at a high level of generality – has substantial impact on these profiles,
frequently in unexpected ways.
2. Intuition suggests that bequests may provide a possible route to the resolution
of some of the most celebrated anomalies in financial economics; viz., the risk free and
1

Our model construct presumes that gifts of either sort can occur only in the final period of an agent’s
life. Since in basic discrete time models we may assume consumption occurs at any time within a period,

2

equity premium puzzles. The logic with respect to the equity premium and risk free
rate puzzles is particularly straightforward. Within the context of the representative
consumer, time separable preferences paradigm of, e.g., Grossman and Shiller (1981),
Hansen and Singleton (1983), and Mehra and Prescott (1985), it is the very low
covariance of aggregate consumption growth with equity returns that constitutes a
major stumbling block to explaining the mean equity premium; vis-à-vis consumption
risk, stocks are simply too good a hedging instrument to command a return much in
excess of that on risk free securities.
In the model to be considered here, however, the magnitude of a household’s
bequests – and the indirect utility thereby derived – are perfectly positively correlated
with the prices of and returns to securities.2 With regard to “bequest risk”, equity
securities, in particular, constitute an especially poor hedge, a fact that suggests high
equilibrium equity and low risk free returns. Confirming this basic intuition, our
benchmark cases indeed display high equity premia in conjunction with low risk free
returns. It is not the case, however, that an increased preference for bequests necessarily
results in a higher premium.
These explorations entail significant methodological innovations in the nature of
the economy’s fundamental asset pricing relationships. No longer are asset prices
benchmarked solely to consumption and the standard inter-temporal consumption trade-

it may be viewed either as preceding the gift (in which case the gift effectively constitutes a bequest) or in
simultaneity with it (in which case the gift qualifies as an inter-vivos transfer).

And, of course, real estate. Our model does not attempt to explicitly model real estate as a differential
asset.

off. In effect, the consumption cost to an investor of acquiring one more unit of an asset
is significantly reduced by the amount of the bequest he can rationally expect to receive.
In a stationary equilibrium, the more investors wish to bequeath, the more wealth they
receive – in the form of bequests – with which with to do so. Equilibrium asset prices
are thus higher than they would be otherwise in an identically parameterized standard
pure consumption-savings context.
What motivates the bequeathing of economic property? While a casual
consideration of bequests naturally assumes that they exist because of parents’ altruistic
concern for the economic status of their offspring, results in Hurd (1989) and Kopczuk
and Lupton (2004), among others (see also Wilhelm (1996), Laitner and Juster (1996),
Altonji et al. (1997), and Laitner and Ohlsson (2001)), suggest otherwise: households
with children do not in general exhibit behavior more in accord with a bequest motive
than childless households. As a result, the literature is presently largely agnostic as to
bequest motivation, attributing bequests to general idiosyncratic, egoistic reasons.3 The
model we will explore, however, is sufficiently general to be consistent both with purely
egoistic and purely altruistic, concern-for-offspring based motivations.
Although the motivation for bequests is not yet well understood, there is little
dispute as to their pervasiveness and significance for household capital accumulation.
Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) present evidence that roughly 46% of household wealth
arises from intergenerational transfers, although Modigliani’s (1988) analysis points to a

4

more modest 20% estimate.4 Other studies place inherited wealth as a proportion of
household wealth in the range of 15% – 31%.5 Using a more general statistical
methodology, Kopczuk and Lupton (2004) estimate that 70% of the elderly population
has a bequest motive, which directly motivates 53% of the wealth accumulation in single
person, elderly U. S. households. Among wealthy households, those that own the vast
majority of stocks and are most likely to trade financial instruments, Hurd and
Mundaca (1989) report that between 44% and 60% of household wealth is attributable
to gifts and inheritances. None of these estimates is so small as to imply that bequests
can be ignored in a discussion of asset pricing regularities. Yet, to our knowledge, the
implications of bequests for such regularities have not yet been explored in the applied
literature.
A consideration of bequests mandates that our study be undertaken in an OLG
context. Agents live for three periods. In the first period, while young, they consume
their income and neither borrow nor lend. We adopt this convention as a parsimonious
device for acknowledging that, with a steep expected future income profile, the young do
not wish to lend and cannot borrow because they have no assets to offer as collateral.
In the second, high wage, middle-aged period of their lives they consume, save for old

3

These empirical results will lead us to eschew the perspective of Barro and Becker (1988), who postulate
that each generation receives utility from the consumption of the generations to follow, in favor of a more
general formulation.
4
We discuss the basis of this wide discrepancy in estimates in the calibration section of the paper. The
estimates themselves come from converting flows of bequests into stocks of capital. Alternatively, one
may estimate life cycle savings and compare this with accumulated wealth. Under this latter method, the
estimates of Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) and Modigliani (1988) become, respectively, 81% and 20%.
5
This range of estimates is drawn from Menchick and David, (1983), Modigliani (1988), Hurd and
Mundaca (1989), Gale and Scholz (1994), and Laitner and Juster (1996).

age and receive bequests of securities from the then old who were born one period
earlier. In the third and final period of their lives, as elderly, they consume out of their
pension income and savings and themselves leave the residual as a bequest of securities,
the value of which is modeled as directly providing them utility.
We further refine the behavior of the elderly in a number of alternative ways. In
the simplest version of the model, the consumption of the old is fixed, with the entire
residual value of savings going to bequests. For the old aged, the only source of risk is
therefore bequest risk. In making this assumption we appeal to the fact that a
substantial component of old aged spending is medically determined. It is thus related
to the state of a person’s health and uncorrelated with the business cycle. Other
components of old aged consumption, such as vacations, entertainment and housing, are
also largely a function of the state of an elderly person’s health. Particularly for the
well-to-do, fluctuations in the value of their wealth invested in the stock market play
but a secondary role in determining overall spending, a fact that is confirmed by the low
empirical correlation between the direct consumption of the old and the return on the
stock market. As a first approximation, it is thus reasonable to exclude the direct
consumption of the old consumers from consideration in examining the relevant Euler
equations. Fixing old age direct consumption has this effect. Subsequent versions of
the model jointly endogenize the choice between old-age direct consumption versus
indirect consumption in the form of bequests.

6

While our discussion thus far has stressed the motivation for bequests, there is
also the issue of who receives them. Many of our results that most accurately replicate
the data require that a portion of bequests be generation-skipping; that is, granted to
the young (grandchildren) rather than to the middle aged (children). More generally we
can thus view our work as investigating the asset pricing implications of various family
arrangements for bequeathing wealth. We do not consider, however, the consequences of
alternative estate tax mechanisms.
1.1 Related Literature
The theoretical antecedents of this work are many. Since not all agents in our
model hold securities, it is directly related to the literature emphasizing the limited
participation of some households in the financial markets. Mankiw and Zeldes (1991)
emphasize that it should be the risk preferences and consumption risk of the
stockholding class that matter for equilibrium security returns. Although 52 percent of
the U.S. adult population held stock directly or indirectly in 1998, as compared to 36
percent in 1989, substantial stock holdings remain largely concentrated in the portfolios
of the wealthiest few. Brav, Constantinides, and Geczy (2002) and Vissing-Jorgenson
(2002) find evidence that per capita consumption growth can explain the equity
premium with a relatively high coefficient of relative risk aversion (CRRA) once we
account for limited stock market participation.6 In addition, wealthy investors may be

Brav, Constantinides, and Geczy (2002) point out, however, that the statistical evidence is weak and the
results highly sensitive to experimental design.
7

infra marginal in the equity markets if their wealth is tied up in private equity. See, for
example, Blume and Zeldes (1993) and Haliassos and Bertaut (1995).
The presence of financial market incompleteness connects us to another well
developed branch of the literature. Bewley (1982), Mankiw (1986) and Mehra and
Prescott (1985) suggest the potential of enriching the asset pricing implications of the
representative agent paradigm by relaxing the implicit complete markets paradigm.
More recently, Constantinides and Duffie (1996) confirm that incomplete markets can
substantially enrich the implications of the representative household. Their main result
is a proposition demonstrating, by construction, the existence of a household income
process, consistent with calibrated aggregate dividend and income processes such that
equilibrium equity and bond price processes match the analogous observed price
processes for the U.S. economy. Unlike the household-specific heterogeneity introduced
in Constantinides and Duffie (1996), the OLG model considered here emphasizes only
the heterogeneity across age cohorts. Whereas introducing household-specific
heterogeneity may enhance the explanatory power of the model, we eschew this option
in order to highlight the role of the indirect consumption of the old aged in the form of
gifts and bequests. See Kocherlakota (1996) for an excellent review of the drawbacks to
relying purely on incomplete-markets phenomena.
1.2 Outline of the Paper
The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 details the simplest model
formulation and presents the calibration. That agents receive utility directly from the

8

magnitude of their bequests represents a departure from the standard Arrow-Debreu
equilibrium construct: the level of consumption provided by the bequests simultaneously
provides utility to two distinct agents, the old who bequeath the bequests and the
middle-aged who receive them. Existence issues are addressed. In Section 3 we present
the results of computing equilibrium security prices and returns for a wide class of
reasonable parameterizations. Robustness issues are explored in Section 4 where we also
generalize the model to allow the old to undertake a consumption-bequest choice.
Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. The Model, Equilibrium and Calibration
2.1 Model Description
As in Constantinides et al. (2002), we consider an overlapping generations, pure
exchange economy in which each generation lives for three periods, as young, middle
aged and old. Each generation is modeled as a representative consumer, a choice that
implicitly ignores consumer heterogeneity within a generation in favor of exploring the
implications of heterogeneity across generations in as parsimonious a construct as
possible.
Income (output) in this model is denominated in terms of a single consumption
good, and may be received either as wages, dividends or interest payments. There are
two types of securities in positive net supply, an equity claim and a consol bond, b.
Each bond pays one unit of the consumption good every period in perpetuity (aggregate

9

interest payments are thus b) and q bt denotes its period t, ex-coupon price. We view the
bond as a proxy for long-term government debt.
The single equity security represents a claim to the stochastic aggregate dividend
stream {dt}. We interpret the dividend as the sum total of all private capital income
including corporate dividends, corporate bond interest and net rents. The ex-dividend
period t share price is denoted by q et . In equilibrium, the stock and consol bond are the
instruments by which the economic participants can seek to alter their income profiles
across dates and states.
Lastly, we postulate the existence of a one period, risk free discount security,
r

with period t price q tf in zero net supply. The payoff profile associated with such a
security issued in some arbitrary period t is

t +1

t
r

!q tf

While the formal presence or absence of this security does not alter the equilibrium
allocations in any way, we include it in order to assess the economy’s implied risk free
rate. In what follows, we detail only the most basic version of the model; elaborations
are detailed in subsequent sections.
Let Bt!2,2 be the total bequest in period t granted by the old generation born
two periods previously. We hypothesize that they grant the fraction x to their
grandchildren, those born in the current period t, and the fraction (1-x) to their children

10

born in t-1. Under this arrangement each generation receives two bequests over the
course of its life, one from its parents and another from its grandparents.
Accordingly, a representative consumer born in period t receives deterministic
0

wage income W and a bequest of securities xBt!2,2 when young. We assume that he
concludes the young period of his life with zero holdings of securities; in effect,

c t,0 = c0 = W 0 + xBt!2,2 , where c0,t denotes the consumption of a young agent born in
period t. This requirement is a simple way of capturing the fact that wage income does
not collateralize loans in modern economies, and that under our calibration, the wage
cum wealth profile of a representative consumer is sufficiently steep that it is nonoptimal for him to save.
In the second period of his life, as middle aged, the period-t-born agent receives a

! 1 , and a stochastic bequest of securities from the preceding
stochastic wage income, W
t+1

generation born in period t-1; we denote the latter by (1 ! x) B
. Out of this aggregate

wealth, the middle aged agent chooses the number of equity securities, z et,1 , consol

he wishes to acquire in order to finance his old-

age consumption and bequests, and his (residual) level of middle aged consumption.
Accordingly, his budget constraint assumes the form

where ct,1 denotes the consumption of a middle aged agent born in period t.

11

In the final period of his life, the period-t born-agent receives a pension
income W 2 . He fully consumes this quantity. He also consumes, by selling securities from
his portfolio, and bequeaths his residual holdings:

In effect, the elderly in this model sell a portion of their security holdings to the middle
aged to supplement their old-age pension income. Their total consumption is
therefore W 2 + c! *t,2 , and they pass down the residual value of their portfolio as a gift. We
consider the case when c! 2 is endogenously determined and when it is fixed: c! *t,2 = c2 . As
mentioned in the introduction, the later is a parsimonious device to capture the fact at
old age consumption is uncorrelated with the return on securities and is largely
governed by health status.

In the above formulation, u (·) denotes the agent’s utility-of-consumption function and v

the utility of bequests. Both u (·) and v(·) are assumed to display all the basic
properties sufficient for problem (3) to be well defined: they are continuously
differentiable, strictly concave, increasing, and satisfy the Inada conditions. The
postulated bequest function v(·) is sufficiently general to encompass both altruistic and
egoistic bequest motivations. Notice that old agents are concerned only about their
aggregate bequest and not its relative apportionment to their children and their
grandchildren.

We first examine the case where old age consumption is fixed, that is c! *2,t = c2 so
that c! 2,t = c2 + W 2 . In equilibrium, the middle aged are the exclusive source of the
demand for securities, and their optimal holdings are determined by the tradeoff
between their marginal utility of consumption as middle aged and the expected
discounted marginal benefit to granting one additional unit of indirect consumption in
the form of a bequest. Taking prices as given, the middle aged agent’s optimal holdings
of equity, bonds, and risk free assets satisfy, respectively, the following three equations:

As was argued in the introduction, asset prices are higher in the presence of
bequests than in a standard consumption-savings setting and the basis for this assertion
is directly apparent in equations (9) – (11): there is a reduced (by the factor (1-x))
middle aged utility cost of paying more for a security since higher prices only mean
greater offsetting bequests in our stationary equilibrium (see also Geanakoplos et al.
(2003))7. As a result, prices are bid up to higher levels.
To varying degrees, all three agents receive utility from the same portfolio of securities:
the young, whose consumption is enhanced when they sell their share of the bequest to
the middle-aged; the middle aged who receive the bulk of the inheritance which thereby
allows them to save for their own bequests with a much diminished reduction in

Note that in the special case when x=0, that is when there is no bequest to the young, q t , q t , and q tf do

not appear in the marginal utility expressions on the left hand side of, respectively, equations (9), (10),
and (11). This is unlike in a standard OLG setting. As the “auctioneer” calls out an increasing set of
prices, the marginal utility of period t consumption does not increase to reduce demand. The effect of
price increases on the suppression of demand is thus greatly reduced, a fact that suggests the possibility of
explosive price behavior. That prices are likely to be higher under a bequest equilibrium relative to a

16

consumption; and the old who receive utility directly from the bequests they bequeath.
As such, equations (9) – (11) represent a fundamental departure from the standard
CCAPM based asset pricing relationships and are unique to the ‘behavioral finance’
literature.
Following Constantinides et al. (2002), we specify four admissible states
representing two possible values of output in conjunction with two possible values of the
wage endowment of the middle aged. The two preference functions are assumed to be

2.3 Existence of Equilibrium and its Properties
Generically (that is, for all reasonable parameterizations of Y(j), W1(j), W0, d(j),
c2 , β, and πij) equilibrium does not exist for this bequest driven model. In particular, if

M is “too small,” securities are insufficiently valued for bequests to be strictly positive
in all states. As a consequence, there is no solution to (9)

– (11)

with positive real

prices. If M is extremely large, middle aged investors, in their desire to leave more
generous bequests, bid up security prices all the while receiving simultaneously more
resources with which to do so. This scenario gives rise to equilibria where prices are so
high that returns are absurdly low (even extremely negative in the risk free asset case).
These latter equilibria are of little interest. Taken together these considerations suggest
a fairly narrow range of M values 0 < M1 < M < M 2 < ∞ for which relevant equilibria
are likely to result8. These thoughts are confirmed in the numerical solutions to follow.
See appendix 1 for proof of existence.

the equilibrium price functions can be substantially simplified: if {(qe(j), qb(j), q f (j) ) j =

r

j = 1,2,3,4}, then for any λ>0, {(λqe(j), qb(j), q f ( j) ): j=1,2,3,4} is an equilibrium for
the economy defined by {(λY(j), λW1(j), λW0, λb, λ c2 ): j=1,2,3,4}.9 Returns are thus
unaffected if the economy is scaled up or down.

2.4 The Comparison Pareto Optimum
One can approach the notion of a Pareto optimum for a bequest driven model
from a number of perspectives. On the one hand, with utility defined over wealth
(prices) the standard notion of a Pareto optimal allocation as one resulting from the
actions of an all powerful central planner empowered to reallocate real resources does
not apply. We therefore must appeal to the notion of a constrained Pareto optimum,
constrained by the participation of the market (trading) mechanism. That is, either
before or after the planner reallocates “something,” trade must be permitted.
There does not seem to be, a priori, an obviously unique way to do this. For
example, one could postulate the “planner” as choosing the value of x such that the
expected welfare of a representative cohort is maximized. Alternatively, one could
propose a Pareto optimum allocation as that arising from the application of a system of

wage taxes and wage subsidies such that, again, the welfare of a representative cohort is
maximized. Since we are principally interested in security price and return behavior,
however, we maintain our emphasis on the bequest equilibrium economy alone.10

3. Calibration
In this section we select parameter values for the period utility and bequest
function while also specifying the joint stochastic process on Yt and Wt1 . Our calibration
closely follows Constantinides et al. (2002).
There are eleven parameter values to be selected: {(Y(j), W1(j): j=1,2,3,4}, W0,
b, c2 , β,

M, γC and γB}. In light of the homogeneity property, for an arbitrary choice

of E(Y), {Y(j), W1(j): j=1,2,3,4}, W0, b, and c2 can be chosen to replicate the
fundamental ratios
! ! 1 E( W
! 1 ), E(W 0 ) / E( Y)

! 1 + W 2 ) / E( Y)
! , E(b) / E( Y)
! and E(c ) / E( Y)

With a period corresponding to 20 years, and a maximum of five or six reliable nonoverlapping 20 year periods in U.S. real GDP and aggregate wage data, it is difficult to
conclusively fix the output and middle aged wage coefficients of variation. Following
the discussion in our earlier paper, both are chosen to be about 0.2011 (see
Constantinides et al. (2002) for an elaboration).

10

Our benchmark calibrations will call for x = .25. By evaluating the expected utility of a representative cohort for a
variety of x, we find that x = .25 is not far from the Pareto optimum.
11
The exact values are 0.18 for the former and 0.23 for the latter.
20

The remaining ratios, however, can be established with more confidence.
Consistent with U.S. historical experience, we fix the share of income to interest on U.S.
! , at 0.03. Depending on the historical period and the manner

by which single proprietorship income is imputed, the average share of income to wages,

E(W 0 + W
! 1 + W 2 ) / E( Y)
! = 0.69
For most of our examples, we match the ratio E(W 0 + W

We choose W 0 , W 2 and c2 in order to replicate the U.S. age-consumption
expenditure profile in Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2002; Figure 4.1.1), where we
interpret our three period lifetimes as corresponding roughly to the 0-20, 20-60 and 6080 age cohorts detailed there. For our benchmark calibration, in particular, their data

choosing W 0 = 18,000, W 2 = 8,000 and c2 = 10,000 . Lastly, we fix β =.55 (corresponding
to a βannual = .97) for all cases and, in all benchmark calibrations, γC = γB=5, which is
within the acceptable range of estimates provided by micro studies.
None of the aforementioned expectations and standard deviations can be

3.1

Choosing a Value for the Bequest Parameter M
The parameter M, by governing the extent to which the middle-aged desire to

bequeath, substantially influences both the relative and absolute level of equilibrium
security price. Given this setting we select a value for M in order that the share of

(

existing wealth that is being gifted, Bt!1, 2

(q

e
t

))

+ d t + b(q bt + 1) , roughly respects the

data.
As noted in the introduction, Summers and Kotlikoff (1981) estimate that
intergenerational transfers (inter-vivos gifts and bequests), as a fraction of private
wealth accumulation can be as much as 80%, while Modigliani (1988) concludes that a
reasonable lower bound on this same fraction is 20%. These estimates differ because of
the inconsistent treatment of durable goods valuation, college tuition payments and the
assumed fraction of inheritances not spent. The average of these extreme estimates
suggests that intergenerational transfers may account for as much as 50% of private
wealth accumulation, a figure consistent with estimates in Hurd and Mundaca (1989)
for high income families. In terms of absolute quantities, Gale and Scholz (1992)
estimate (for the year 1983) that the flow of bequests was on the order of $30 – $40
billion, with inter-vivos transfers ranging to $56 billion. If college tuition expenses are
included, the latter rises to $88 billion. Unfortunately, none of these studies separates
out bequests and gifts of marketable securities from aggregate totals (which include real
estate, undoubtedly the largest component of smaller estates).

23

A more useful estimate of the desired ratio can be obtained directly from estate
tax data which provides the aggregate market value of bequeathed equity. As a fraction
of CRSP aggregate Equity Market Value, this latter quantity gives a rough

(

approximation to the Bt!1, 2

(q

e
t

))

+ d t + b(q bt + 1) ratio under a number of simplifying

assumptions. Since equity bequests include private equity we need to argue that the
latter is small. McGrattan and Prescott (2000), for the year 2000 estimate that more
than 90% of business capital is publicly traded equity capital, an estimate that supports
this assertion. Consistent with the figures in the prior paragraph we will also assume
that inter-vivos transfers of stock alone may be conservatively estimated as having value
equal to stock transfers as elements of bequests.13
Under these assumptions, the ratio of twice the value of equity bequests as a
proportion of CRSP aggregate market value is roughly analogous to our

(

quantity Bt!1, 2

(q

e
t

))

+ d t + b(q bt + 1) . Table 2 below supplies the relevant data for a

selection of the years for which data is available.

13

Most equity is owned by the wealthiest segment of the population who holds an above average fraction
of their total wealth in stock. We are simply asserting here that for this segment of the population, the
fraction {(inter vivos transfers of equity/value of bequested equity} is approximately the same as the
ratio of {inter vivos transfers/ bequests} for the population as a whole.

The value of annually bequeathed stock generally declined as a percentage of
aggregate stock market value until the 1990s when it stabilized at roughly 0.6%. On
the basis of a 20 year time horizon, and assuming stationary-in-levels asset values, this
represents a total equity bequest equal to 12% of aggregate stock market valuations. If
1977 is used as the base, the ratio rises to 25%; in 1950 the fraction was around 45%
while in 1931 it was 160%. These figures suggest a wide of estimates14. Doubling these
figures to include inter-vivos transfers, in any event, encourages us to conclude that a

(

reasonable value of M should result in a ratio Bt!1, 2

(q

t

+ d t + b(q bt + 1)

)) lying in the

range [0.5, 1] for postwar data. This is easily attained given our parameterization.

25

In what follows we numerically solve equations (9) – (11) for the indicated
parameterizations. In order to gauge model sensitivity, we allow M, and ! C = ! B to
vary. Since the results depend very little, either qualitatively or quantitatively, on the
choice of transition matrix, we typically only report results for cases corresponding to

! = .5298 .

Equilibrium Results

4.1

Benchmark Economy

Much of the intuition provided by this model is evident from the fixed old age
consumption case. This perspective was justified earlier by arguing that the
consumption of the old aged is governed by their health status, a circumstance that is
likely to be unrelated to the business cycle, especially for those with large equity
holdings. Fixing old-age consumption at a constant level reflects this viewpoint in a
parsimonious way.
Table 3 provides a basic set of results for an uncontroversial set of parameters.
The risk aversion parameter γC is fixed at γC = 5, and M is chosen to be M = 101 . It
seems intuitively reasonable that agents would value their bequests less highly than
their own consumption.

14

The substantially lower figures for more recent years are interesting and may reflect either an increased
use of tax avoidance schemes (e.g., generation-skipping trusts) by the very wealthy who own the lion’s
share of equity in the U.S. or the broader ownership of stocks in small estates exempt from taxation.

The benchmark economy displays considerable success in replicating the mean
return on equity (6.1) and its standard deviation (17.1).15 The equity premium is a
robust 5.0%, attributable in large measure to a relatively low risk free rate (1.2%).
Also, the bequests/assets ratio falls comfortably within the range of empirical estimates.

The reader is cautioned to keep in mind how these returns are computed and the consequent

The standard deviation of the risk free return, however, is too high (21.9) and
exceeds the standard deviation of the equity return. To understand this, consider the
special case x = c 2 = b = 0 while appealing to continuity arguments for wider
applicability. The Euler equations of consumption for the prices of equity and the oneperiod bond under this specialization are as follows:

(4.2)

The Euler equation of equity is isomorphic to that of the one-period bond except that
the degree of bequest risk aversion is lower by one. This follows directly from the fact
that the equity’s next period pre-dividend value partially offsets variation in its
marginal utility of wealth (for log utility the offset is perfect), making it effectively the
less risky security in utility-of-bequest terms.
In the context of the consumption-based asset pricing model, higher risk aversion
typically leads to higher return volatility because consumers have a greater incentive to
smooth consumption. Their demand for securities is thus higher in high-income states
and lower in low-income ones. Ceteris paribus, security price volatility and return
volatility are higher. Similar reasoning applies to our bequest economy. Equity is
effectively priced in a less risk averse environment and consequently displays lower
return volatility, as observed.
Our results suggest that if a particular security (under our parameterizations,
equity) provides the overwhelming majority of bequest utility, that security will display
the greater relative price stability irrespective of the volatility of its dividend.

In a

28

world where agents derive utility directly from bequests (wealth), the notion of risk is
blurred.16 High variability of the risk free rate is sometimes a problem in certain multisector real business cycle models, as in Boldrin, Christiano and Fisher (2001).
Alternative specifications that may reduce the variability of the risk free rate include
state-dependent risk aversion, as in Campbell and Cochrane (1999).
Each period two cohorts receive utility from the same portfolio of bequeathed
securities: the middle aged through an increase in their wealth and the old through the
joy of giving. This feature represents a departure from the standard Arrow-Debreu
economy. The prices of both equity and bonds are higher in the presence of bequests
because two cohorts receive utility from the same portfolio of bequeathed securities.17 In
the benchmark case, the average equity price is more than twice what is observed in the
pure consumption-savings analogue for an otherwise identical parameterization.18
4.2

Sensitivity to the Bequest Weight

Table 4 illustrates the effect of increasing the bequest weight M. As bequests become
more important, security prices are bid up.19 Since security payments are unaltered,
rates of return decrease

16

Cass and Pavlova (2000) illustrate analogous ambiguity in a standard Lucas (1978) asset pricing model
with log utility where the representative agent trades a risk free bond and a stock. They introduce a
simple linear transformation by which the stock becomes the risk free asset and the bond becomes the
risky one in the sense that its payment is now uncertain. While their model context is very different from
the one considered here, they present a similar instance of the more variable return security having the
lesser associated payment variation.
17
See also Gaenakoplos et al. (2003).
e

r

In the special case x=0, that is when there is no bequest to the young, q t ,q t and q t f do not appear in
the marginal utility of the middle-aged. This is unlike in a standard OLG setting. As the “auctioneer”
calls out an increasing set of prices, the marginal utility of period t consumption does not increase to
reduce demand. The effect of price increases on the suppression of demand is thus greatly reduced, a fact
that suggests the possibility of explosive price behavior.
19
With prices rising yet c2 fixed, the E(B/A) ratio will naturally approach one, as observed.

We note that the standard deviations of the returns to all securities also decline with
an increase in M and the origin of this result is less obvious and merits discussion. As M
rises, investors become increasingly concerned about bequest volatility. Their only
recourse is to attempt to acquire more securities, thereby bidding up prices but in a
state by state fashion so as to to diminish price and wealth variation (rational
30

expectations). As noted, security returns uniformly decline towards zero. Adding to this
effect is reduced MRS volatility: as M increases B(j) increases with the result that
'

! c( j) $
#" B(k) &% declines dramatically for all j, k state pairs. In the case of x = 0 , c(j) is
unaffected by M and thus only the denominator, B(k) , increases. The net effect is a
decline in volatility. Note also that as M increases, the equity premium declines from
the high benchmark level of 5%. This phenomena is directly attributable to the
enormous increase in security prices which place the investor on a less concave portion
of his bequest utility function. In effect, as he becomes wealthier the agent becomes less
bequest risk averse, a result that acts as a break on the ability of bequest parameter M
to generate arbitrarily high equity premia. It is thus not at all the case that the
introduction of a bequest motive allows for a facile and contrived resolution of the
equity premium or risk free rate puzzles.

Sensitivity to the RRA Coefficient on Consumption and Bequests

We see that equity and bond prices increase in all states as γ increases for reasons
similar to an increase in M. The average equity/output ratio naturally increases and
the average bequest-over-assets ratio asymptotically approaches one. Equity returns
decrease less rapidly than risk free returns, giving rise to an increasing premium as γ
increases. The volatility of returns increases as well. Collectively, these phenomena are
consistent with behavior of standard CCAPM models (e.g., Mehra and Prescott (1985)).

The general effect of changes in the allocation of bequests is unambiguous.

As the

fraction of bequests passed to the young increases, all security prices decline and returns
rise and the premium declines. As x increases, more securities pass to the young, which
they sell. The middle aged receive smaller bequests and must, in equilibrium, buy more
securities. In effect, the supply of securities (vis-à-vis the middle aged) increases and,
ceteris paribus, equilibrium prices decline. This is reinforced by the fact that the wealth

33

of the middle aged also declines, thereby diminishing demand across the board. Faced
with declining resources it is also unsurprising that the middle aged investors should
slightly shift their portfolio holdings in favor of high payoff securities, the stocks, a fact
accounts for the diminished premium.
The other unambiguous phenomena is the greater equity and risk free return volatility,
as x
diminishes. This reflects more pronounced wealth effects for the middle-aged investors:
as x declines there is a progressively diminished consumption cost to the middle aged of
assembling their own bequest portfolios. As a result, their demand for securities tends to
react more dramatically to changes in their wealth with the ensuing heightened price
and return volatility.

4.5

Endogenous Consumption of the Old

Unlike the benchmark case in which the consumption of the old is fixed, we now
endogenize the consumption of the old in economies with and without bequests.
Bequests and old age consumption are thus jointly determined by the added
requirement that
u1 (c 2 ( j)) = Mv1 (B( j))

for all states j. Once B(j) is determined in this way, the fraction x is bequeathed to the
young and the fraction (1-x) to the middle aged, as before.
The results are presented in Table 7.

In the first column, we present the benchmark case with exogenous consumption
for purposes of comparison. In the second column, the consumption and bequests of the
old are endogenously determined.

In the last column, there are no bequests; the

consumption of the old is endogenously determined by pure consumption and savings

35

considerations.20 Note that for each security type, the associated payments are invariant
across the three cases.
As we move across the table from left to right bequests progressively recede in
importance. Asset prices decline dramatically when bequests are eliminated entirely, a
fact directly attributable to the large influence bequests have on the equilibrium steady
state security prices: unlike saving for old age consumption which entails an actual
(steady state) cost for the middle aged, bequests do not impinge upon middle aged
consumption (at least to the extent of the (1-x) fraction they receive). As a further
consequence of declining bequests, old age consumption increases, but not by the full
magnitude of the bequest reduction because asset prices are lower.
A number of other idiosyncratic features of Table 7 are worth exploring. For
one, the equity price is consistently highest in state one.

It is this state that

corresponds to the highest output level and the highest possible middle-aged wage level.
While not the highest attained value, dividends in this state are much higher than in a
majority of the other states. With a relatively persistent dividend steam and a high
level of income (wages) with which to purchase securities, it is not surprising that these
two effects conspire to bid equity prices up to uniquely high levels.

Although state

20

This corresponds to the constrained problem detailed in Constantinides et al. (2002): middle aged
agents accumulate securities purely to finance their retirement consumption (no bequests). The latter is
accomplished by selling their security accumulation ex dividend to the then middle aged agents. More
formally, the maximization problem of the period-t-born agent is:

three experiences the highest dividend, resources for purchasing securities are much
lower.
Comparing the endogenous bequest and no bequest cases, it is also interesting to
observe that middle aged consumption is higher in the former and old age consumption
higher in the latter. This is not surprising as bequests provide more resources to the
middle aged.

Furthermore, consumption appears to be less smooth intertemporally

under the no bequest regime: comparing the endogenous and no bequest cases, in every
state, middle-aged consumption is lower and old-age consumption higher in the latter
case. This phenomenon follows again from the observation that the effect of bequests is
to shift consumption principally to the middle aged; they do not have to save fully for
old age consumption, and thus can more easily enjoy more consumption as middle aged.
In effect, bequests are equivalent to costless borrowing.21

As a result, middle aged

investors have much higher wealth in the bequest case and bid up securities prices to
much higher levels as observed.

4.6

Exploring Changes in M and other parameters
The data for various M and various γ in an environment of endogenous bequests

is presented in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. Broadly speaking, almost all of the
qualitative relationships detailed for the fixed old age consumption case, and their
underlying justifications, carry over to this more general setting.

21

We have to be careful of this interpretation in that there is no agency or individual in the model from
whom the middle aged might borrow. It is intended to be construed in the sense that a gift is equivalent
to a loan that never needs repayment.

All other parameters as in Table 4.
As M increases, in particular, asset prices and the value of bequests rise, while

expected returns decline. As in the fixed old age consumption case, return volatilities
decline over the indicated range. In general, the range of security prices across states is

39

less in the endogenous consumption case. This is manifest in lower standard deviations
of return across all securities. Bequests are also smaller since proportionally more
securities are offered for sale. However, the volatility of the risk free return exceeds that
of the equity security, as in Table 3, and for the same fundamental reasons. That
bequests and old age consumption coincide in real terms for the right most case (Table
8) is a direct implication of constraint (13), since M = 1 and γC =γB.
The comparative results (Tables 5 vs. 9) for an increase in risk aversion are in
the same spirit. As in the fixed old age consumption case, greater risk aversion
coincides with lower expected returns and higher return volatilities. The equity
premium also increases with gamma. For ! " 2 , E(B/A) uniformly lies nearly within the
acceptable range. As in the previous case, prices and return statistics are muted relative
to their fixed old age consumption counterparts. There are no issues of the nonexistence of equilibrium for any of these cases, however.
Substantial differences can be found in the level and variation in the price and
bequest series. Comparing Tables 9 with 5, there is seen to be much less variation in
bequest levels or asset prices across the four states, a fact that is also manifest in the
means and standard deviations of returns across all the securities. This is to be
expected: in the former case quantities can adjust more freely. There is thus less need
for prices themselves to adjust.

40

4.7 Changes in the Bequest Parameter x
Table 10 is the endogenous counterpart to Table 6. Most of the intuition comes over
from that latter case: an increase in “x” restricts the flexibility of the middle aged and,
necessarily increases the supply of securities which the middle aged, in equilibrium, must
purchase. Prices necessarily decline with the resultant increase in expected return.
Notice also that, for any choice of x, return volatilities are higher under the fixed old
age consumption regime. This follows from the countervailing force at work in the
endogenous consumption case which is otherwise absent in the exogenous old age
consumption setting. Under the former setting, the investor also wishes to stabilize his
old age consumption, a fact that leads him to seek more strongly to acquire securities in
low dividend (low price) states than in higher ones. This behavior, per se , tends to
stabilize prices and is absent in the fixed old age consumption case. Thus price and
return volatilities are lower.
The pattern of volatilities as x increases also varies from Table 6 to Table 10,
declining with x in the former case and rising in the later. With only a bequest motive
(Table 6), as the wealth of the middle aged declines (x increases) the price and return
effects resulting from their desire to stabilize their future wealth are more muted. In the
exogenous case, this is offset by the middle aged generation’s desire to smooth its old
age consumption; apparently the former force predominates in Table 10. In either case
the effects are not large.

5. Concluding Remarks
We have examined the influence of bequests on equilibrium security prices and
returns. Generally speaking, the effect of bequests is to dramatically increase security
prices. In a standard consumption-savings model, the purchase of securities to finance
future consumption reduces consumption today, thereby raising the marginal utility of
consumption, which acts as a discouragement to further savings. This latter effect is
not present in a bequest-driven model of the type considered here, at least in the steady
state, leading to much more powerful income effects. Both asset prices and price
volatility tend to be substantially higher. We are able to keep the prices low and
generate realistic values of the mean risk free rate, the mean equity premium, the
variance of the equity premium and the ratio of bequests to wealth by stipulating that a
portion of the bequests skips a generation.
Two key parameters of the model are the weight on the utility of bequests and
the fraction of the bequests that skips the generation of the middle-aged and is received
by the young. It is possible that a judicious choice of these parameters may lower the
observed unrealistically high relative variance of the risk free rate.

The set A is compact in R2N. Furthermore, since !(j) > 0 "j , T is continuous on A.
Clearly, for every (x(1), . . . , x(N), y(1), . . . , y(N)) ≥ 0, T(x(1), . . . , x(N), y(1), . . .
y(N)) ≥ 0. In order to apply Brower’s Fixed Point Theorem we need only to show that
each entry in the image of T falls short of ! ; i.e., that T(A) ! A . For any x(j)

Thus there exists a fixed point ( x̂(1),..., x̂(N), ŷ(1),..., ŷ(N)) of T on A. Identify

Note that since !(j) > 0 and d(j) > 0 "j, q e ( j), q b ( j) >0 "j. Finally, q f ( j) > 0 is

defined as per (11) once q e ( j), q b ( j) are determined.
Commentary: The critical assumption in Proposition 1 is that !(j) >0 " j . This means
that no matter how low asset prices may be, the value of assets cum dividends and
interest payments is always sufficient to finance old age consumption c2 . Without such
an assumption, the constant M must be sufficiently large as to guarantee that asset
prices are great enough to satisfy:
q e ( j) + d( j) + b(q b ( j) + 1) ! c2 > 0
We argue this fact because intuitively as M ! 0 , q e ( j) ! 0 and q b ( j) ! ! j (see also
Proposition 2 to follow). Without the !(j) >0 "j requirement it is necessary to establish
a lower bound on M in order for equilibrium to exist, a fact borne out repeatedly by the
results of our numerical solutions to (9!) " (11! ) .

Proposition 2: Suppose the conditions for the existence of equilibrium are satisfied, and
assume furthermore that γC = γB > 1. Suppose also that the endowment process {Y(j),
W1(j)} is i.i.d. through time. If M2 > M1,
r

then q e ( j, M 2 ) > q e ( j, M1 ) ! j, q b ( j, M 2 ) > q b ( j, M1 ) !j and q f ( j, M 2 ) > q f ( j, M1 ) !j .

Proof: For simplicity, let us ignore the consol bond by setting its supply equal to zero.
The system of non-linear equations which define equilibrium is thus,

Lemma 1: Let us maintain ! B > 1. Since d(k) > c2 , !k,
Z′(x) < 0, where Z(x) =

x + d(k)
"# x + d(k) ! c2 $%

&B

Proof: Clearly Z(x) is differentiable for x > 0, and
# x + d(k) " c2 %&
Z!(x) = $

#$ x + d(k) ! c2 &' B
The denominator is strictly positive and

x + d(k)
>1 "k .
x + d(k) ! c2

Thus, since ! B > 1 ,

" x + d(k) %
$
' >1
# x + d(k) ! c2 &
and Z!(x) < 0.
Continuation of Proof of Proposition 2: As noted in the Lemma, we may write the
equilibrium conditions defining the equity price as, ! j ,
N

q e ( j) = ! M "(j)$ # jk Z(q e (k)) , where Z (x) is differentiable with Z′(x) < 0 for x >
k=1

0. Differentiating the equilibrium condition yields

Since both numerator and denominator are strictly positive,

!q e ( j)
> 0 " j.
!M

It follows that if M2 > M1,
q e ( j, M 2 ) > q e ( j, M1 ) ! j .

Proposition 3: Again, consider the case of b = 0 , and assume !( j) > 0 " j . Then if q̂ e ( j)
are the equilibrium equity prices for the standard consumption-savings problem and
q e ( j) are the equilibrium equity prices of the bequest economy of equations (9′) – (11′),
then
q e ( j) > qˆ e ( j) ! j .
Proof: We know that equilibrium equity prices exist for both economies; let them be
denoted as indicated. Then, for any state j,
N
$ jk
q̂ e ( j) = ! M(W1 ( j) " q̂ e ( j)) # % e
# "1
k =1 (q̂ (k) + d(k)
Since ! ( j) > 0 " j ,
N

$ jk

k =1

(q̂ (k) + d(k) " c2 ) # "1

q̂ e ( j) < ! M(W1 ( j) + d( j) " c2 ) # %

or
N
$ jk
q̂ e ( j)
<
#
M
% (q̂ e (k) + d(k) ! c )" !1 .
(W1 ( j) + d( j) ! c2 ) "
k =1
2

Thus, for any j, at the prices q̂ e ( j) , the marginal utility cost of acquiring one share of the
equity security is less than the expected marginal utility benefit in the bequest economy.
In order for equilibrium to be established, all prices must be bid up. Thus
q e ( j) > q̂ e ( j), ! j .
The identical argument can be employed to demonstrate that
r

r

q̂ f ( j) < q f ( j), ! j .
