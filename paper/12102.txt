ABSTRACT
Panel data econometric methods are used to investigate how the risk of death from acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) varies with macroeconomic conditions after controlling for demographic factors,
fixed state characteristics, general time effects and state-specific time trends. The sample includes
residents of the 20 largest states over the 1979 to 1998 period. A one percentage point reduction in
unemployment is predicted to raise AMI mortality by 1.3 percent, with a larger increase in relative
risk for 20-44 year olds than older adults, particularly if the economic upturn is sustained.
Nevertheless, the much higher absolute AMI fatality rate of senior citizens implies that they account
for most of the additional deaths. This suggests the importance of factors like air pollution and
traffic congestion that increase with economic activity, are linked to coronary heart disease and may
have particularly strong effects on vulnerable segments of the population, such as the frail elderly.
AMI mortality risk quickly rises when the economy strengthens and increases further if the favorable
economic conditions persist. This is consistent with strong effects of other short-term factors on
heart attack risk and with health being a durable capital stock that is affected by flows of lifestyle
behaviors and environmental conditions whose effects accumulate over time.

A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart
Does the risk of death from heart attacks (acute myocardial infarction) fall when
macroeconomic conditions strengthen? The answer to this question may seem obvious. Since
economic upturns are often believed to reduce social and psychological hardship, health might be
expected to improve and mortality to decrease. Moreover, widely cited investigations of
aggregate time-series data from the 1930s through 1970s suggest gains in health and reductions
in fatalities from coronary heart disease (CHD) during periods of reduced unemployment
(Brenner, 1971, 1979; Bunn, 1979). However, these results are almost certainly wrong.
Evidence presented below shows that mortality from heart disease rises when the economy
expands and that this is almost entirely due to increases in AMI deaths.
How could the findings of the aforementioned analyses of time-series data be so at odds
with the conclusions of this investigation? First, subsequent research (Gravelle, Hutchinson, &
Stern, 1981; Kasl, 1979; Wagstaff, 1985) points out serious flaws in the methods used in these
studies and research correcting the problems fails to replicate the findings (e.g. Forbes &
McGregor, 1984; McAvinchey, 1988; Joyce & Mocan, 1993). Second, any lengthy time-series is
likely to contain omitted determinants of health that are spuriously correlated with
macroeconomic fluctuations. For instance, dramatic reductions in unemployment at the end of
the great depression (of the 1930s) coincided with improvements in nutrition and wider
availability of antibiotics. Failure to fully control for these and other confounding factors leads
to biased estimates. One consequence is that the results are sensitive to the choice of countries,
time periods and estimation methods (Ruhm, forthcoming).
Instead of using national time-series data, this analysis utilizes information on mortality
rates for the 20 largest states pooled over the years 1979 to 1998. Longitudinal data permits the

use of panel data techniques that are well-known in the econometrics literature, but less often
employed in epidemiological or medical research. These methods fully control for time-varying
determinants of death that are national in scope and factors that differ across states but remain
fixed over time (Jones, 2000). Confounding influences that fluctuate within-states are also
accounted for, although possibly less completely.
A one percentage point drop in the state unemployment rate is estimated to raise the
overall AMI fatality rate by 1.3 percent, corresponding to approximately 2,500 extra heart attack
deaths. The increase in relative risk is larger for 20-44 year olds than older individuals but the
higher absolute AMI fatality risk of senior citizens implies that they account for most of the
additional mortality.
These results are consistent with recent research using similar methods that provides
evidence of increases in total mortality during economic expansions (Ruhm, 2000; Gerdtham &
Ruhm, 2004; Johansson, 2004; Neumayer, 2004; Tapia Granados, 2004; Lin, 2005) but improves
upon the previous work in at least three ways. First, the analysis focuses on acute myocardial
infarction, rather than aggregating this with all types of mortality or more broadly defined causes
of cardiovascular deaths. This is useful since AMI fatalities are well measured, their
determinants have been widely studied and they are affected by changes in environmental
conditions, employment stressors and health behaviors that vary with macroeconomic conditions
(Grundy, Pasternak, Greenland, Smith, & Fuster, 1999; Minino, Arias, Kochanek, Murphy, &
Smith, 2002). Second, separate estimates are provided for subsamples stratified by sex,
race/ethnicity and age. Third, the investigation of potential mechanisms for the effects is more
detailed than in past work, although still somewhat preliminary.
METHODS

Data and Outcomes
The primary dependent variable is the annual state AMI death rate (ICD-9 code 410) for
the 20 largest states measured over the 1979 to 1998 period (n=400). Supplementary models use
the following fatality rates as outcomes: coronary heart disease other than AMI (ICD-9 codes
411-414); all heart disease (ICD-9 codes 390-398, 402, 404-429); and heart disease other than
CHD (ICD-9 codes 390-398, 402, 404, 415-429).
Mortality rates are constructed as the number of deaths from the specified cause divided
by the state population, using data from the Compressed Mortality Files (CMF) obtained from
the CDC (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2000, 2003). The CMF contain sufficient information to separately calculate AMI
fatality rates for males, females, three age categories (20-44, 45-64, 65 years and over), whites
and blacks. Changes in coding methods during the sample period preclude analysis of other
race/ethnicity subgroups. The investigation is limited to the 20 largest states because of small
samples sizes for subpopulations in some other states and since unemployment rates are
frequently not supplied or are measured with considerable error for small states early in the
sample period. The 20 states account for almost three-quarters of national AMI deaths and have
similar mortality patterns to the entire country.
The primary proxy for macroeconomic conditions is the annual state unemployment rate
for the civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 16 and over, with data obtained from the
Local Area Unemployment Statistics Database (U.S. Department of Labor; Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2002). Most specifications control for the fraction of state residents who are female,
black, under 25 years of age, 65 or older, who have never attended college and who are college
graduates. These data are from the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation

Groups, 1979-2001 (CPS-ORG) extract provided by the National Bureau of Economic Research
(National Bureau of Economic Research, 2002). Education refers to persons 25 and older. Prior
to 1992, the CPS-ORG supplied information on years of completed schooling, rather than
explicitly identifying degree or graduation status. For these years, persons with 12 or fewer (16
or more) years of education are placed in the no college (college graduate) category.
The role played by changes in income, work hours or the composition of employment in
explaining a portion of the observed macroeconomic variation in AMI mortality is estimated
from specifications that include controls for average state per capita disposable income (in 1998
dollars), average weekly work hours of persons 25 and over, and the fraction of the population
(25 and older) employed in the cyclically sensitive construction and manufacturing industries.
Information on income is from the BEA Regional Accounts data (U.S. Department of
Commerce; Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2002); that on work hours and industry of
employment is from the CPS-ORG.
Analytic Approach
Analyses of national time-series data are unlikely to adequately control for omitted
determinants of AMI mortality. For instance, the sharp decline in heart attack deaths since the
early 1980s partly results from increased use of aspirin therapy, thrombolysis and other anticoagulants for acute in-hospital treatment, and surgical interventions like cardiac catheterization,
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastsy (PTCA) and PTCA with stent (Heidenreich
&McClellan, 2001; McGovern, Jacobs, Shahar, Arnett Folsom, Blackburn et al., 2001).
Throughout much of this period, there have also been reductions in cardiovascular risk factors
like hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and consumption of dietary fat (Arnett,
McGovern, Jacobs, Shahar, Duval, Blackburn et al., 2002; Cooper, Cutler, Desvigne-Nickens,
A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart

Page 4

For, Friedman, Havlik et al., 2000). These improvements took place during a period of
strengthening macroeconomic conditions – joblessness averaged 8.0% from 1979-1983 versus
5.3% from 1994-1998 – implying a positive correlation between unemployment and AMI
mortality, even absent a causal effect.
Longitudinal data permits the use of methods that better account for potential
confounding factors. Following Ruhm (2000), the basic specification estimated below is:
Mjt = αt + Xjtβ + Ujtγ + Sj + Sj*T + εjt,

(1)

where Mjt is a transformation of the mortality rate in state i at year t, U is the unemployment rate,
X is a vector of demographic characteristics, α is a year-specific effect, S is a state-specific
intercept, Sj*T is a state-specific linear time trend (years elapsed since 1978), and ε is a
disturbance term. Since the dependent variables are mortality rates, restricted between zero and
one, grouped data logit models (where M = ln[m 1 − m] for m the specified mortality rate) are
estimated using maximum chi-squared methods. All statistical and econometric analysis is
conducted using the STATA software package (StataCorp, 2003).
The year dummy variables hold constant determinants of mortality that are national in
scope and vary over time, such as widely dispersed changes in medical practices. The state
intercepts, referred to as “fixed-effects” in the econometrics literature, account for characteristics
that differ across locations but remain constant over time (like persistent differences in lifestyles,
the medical infrastructure or population characteristics). The time trends control for factors that
change slowly and continuously over time within states. The impact of the macroeconomy is
therefore identified by within-state variations in unemployment rates, relative to the fluctuations
occurring in other parts of the country.

The discussion focuses on the effects of a one percentage point drop in the state
unemployment rate. This represents a small improvement in the macroeconomy. To provide
perspective, the standard deviation of the state unemployment rate is 1.9 percentage points; the
national rate increased 2.5 points between December 2000 and June 2003; and unemployment in
California rose 3.7 points between 1979 and 1982 and then fell 4.8 points by 1989. Logit
coefficients show the expected effect on the log-odds ratio of mortality. Since M = ln[m 1 − m]
and m is roughly 0.01 (see Table 1), M ≈ ln( m) and the predicted effect of a one point reduction
in unemployment is closely approximated by e −γˆ − 1 , for γˆ the estimated logit coefficient.
Standard errors are shown in parentheses and 95 percent confidence intervals are sometimes
displayed in brackets. The logit estimates are also used to estimate national change in the
number of AMI deaths, based on actual fatalities in 2000 (Minino, Arias, Kochanek et al., 2002).
Differences in the initial and medium-term effects of sustained economic expansions are
examined through models that control for the average unemployment rate during the five
calendar years prior to the survey date and the change in unemployment during the survey year,
relative to this five-year average. Information on the full adjustment path is obtained from
specifications that hold constant unemployment rates in each year between t-5 and t, with the
cumulative impact of one point drop in joblessness that has lasted for n years (for n between 0
and 5) estimated as eΓ n − 1 for Γ n =

n
k =0

−γˆt −k , where γˆt − k is the logit coefficient on the kth-

year lag of unemployment.

Descriptive Findings

Table 1 displays average values (weighted by population in the state and year) for the
variables used in this analysis. One-third of deaths from heart disease are due to AMI, with other
coronary heart disease being responsible for another 36 percent. AMI fatality risk rises sharply
with age and is higher for men than women and whites than blacks.
Figure 1 shows that unemployment increased during the recessions of the early 1980s and
early 1990s but generally trended down – falling 23% between 1979 and 1998 (from 5.4% to
4.5%). AMI fatalities declined 44% (from 134.1 to 75.2 per 100,000) over this period, mostly
for reasons unrelated to macroeconomic conditions (e.g. changes in medical technologies and
health behaviors). Including year dummy variables in the logit models accounts for all such
confounding factors that are national in scope.
A key advantage of examining mortality rates at the state level is that economic
conditions evolve somewhat independently across locations, with the result that each state
represents a separate “experiment”. Consider California and Texas, the two largest states. The
top panel of Figure 2 demonstrates their quite different patterns of unemployment – California
experienced sharper increases during the early 1980s and early 1990s, while joblessness rose
substantially in Texas during the mid-1980s. The bottom panel shows corresponding AMI
mortality rates, detrended and normalized to average 100 (in each state) over the two decade
period – AMI deaths trended down in both states as for the entire country. Notice that heart
attack fatalities fell relatively rapidly in Texas from the late 1970s through late 1980s, when
unemployment was rising, and more slowly thereafter, when joblessness declined. The patterns
are not as obvious in California, possibly reflecting the lack of a clear unemployment trend.
Other determinants of mortality, such as changes in medical practices, could have been
spuriously correlated with macroeconomic conditions in either state but probably not in both

simultaneously, since their economies evolved so differently. The panel data econometric
methods exploit these state-specific sources of variation.
AMI Mortality Increases When Labor Markets Strengthen

Table 2 displays the logit coefficients from various model specifications. A negative sign
on unemployment corresponds to a higher predicted death rate during economic expansions
(when joblessness falls). The results in column (a), where the only covariate is the state
unemployment rate, indicate a positive correlation between joblessness and AMI fatalities. This
is expected since both variables trended downwards during the sample period. Note, however,
that the parameter estimate switches sign when general time effects are incorporated (model b)
and becomes significantly negative with the inclusion of state fixed-effects (specification c). The
coefficient remains negative and significant, but is somewhat attenuated, when adding statespecific time trends (column d) and demographic characteristics (column e). This last
specification, or variants of it, is focused on below since it contains the most complete controls
for potential confounding factors. In model (e), a one percentage point reduction in
unemployment is predicted to increase AMI deaths by around 1.3 percent.
Coefficients on the demographic variables generally conform to our expectations. Most
importantly, AMI fatalities are negatively (positively) related to the fraction of residents under 25
(over 64) years of age. To examine whether the included covariates adequately account for the
age structure of the population, model (f) displays results for death rates that are age adjusted to
the 2000-year standard population. As expected, doing so results in substantial attenuation of the
coefficients on age and percent female (which, since women live longer than men, is positively
correlated with population age). Importantly, the predicted effects of macroeconomic conditions
are virtually identical with and without age-adjustment.

AMI Deaths Explain the Macroeconomic Variation in Heart Disease Mortality

AMI accounts for around one-third of deaths from heart disease. However, since heart
attacks are likely to be particularly responsive to short-term changes in modifiable health
behaviors and environmental factors, they are anticipated to explain a much larger proportion of
the corresponding macroeconomic fluctuation in fatalities. This prediction is examined and
confirmed in Table 3, where the dependent variables are mortality due to: all types of heart
disease, AMI, coronary heart disease other than AMI, and non-ischemic heart disease.
The 1.3 percent rise in AMI deaths predicted to accompany a one point reduction in
unemployment is more than sufficient to explain the 0.2 increase estimated for mortality from all
types of heart disease (see the first two rows of the table), with similar results again obtained for
crude and age-standardized fatality rates. The key role of heart attacks is further reinforced by
the small and insignificant 0.1 to 0.3 percent increase predicted for deaths from CHD other than
AMI (such as angina pectoris or arteriosclerosis) and the fairly large but imprecisely estimated
0.4 to 0.5 percent reduction for non-ischemic heart disease (like rheumatic heart or hypertensive
disease).
Increases in Fatality Risk are Widespread

Table 4 summarizes results for the AMI mortality of subgroups stratified by sex, race and
age. Here, and below, crude mortality rates are the dependent variables and the models control
for state and year effects, state-specific time trends and demographic characteristics. The
increase in AMI risk from a one percentage point drop in unemployment (column c) is
determined as the average difference between predicted fatality rates at the actual unemployment
rate and one point below it. Additional deaths (column d) are estimated by multiplying the

A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart

Page 9

average change in fatality risk by the base number of deaths (shown in column a). The p-value
(column e) refers to the null hypothesis of no change in AMI mortality.
The estimated rise in relative AMI fatality risk from a one point decrease in joblessness is
similar for males and females (1.34 versus 1.24 percent) and possibly smaller for blacks (1.04
percent) than whites (1.32 percent), although estimates for the former group are imprecise. The
coefficients suggest considerably larger increases for 20-44 year olds (2.37 percent) than for
those 45-64 (0.92 percent) or 65 and over (1.41 percent), although the 95 percent confidence
intervals do overlap.
The stronger economy is predicted to result in 2,515 extra heart attack deaths, almost
equally split between men and women. While the greatest increase in relative risk occurs among
25-44 year olds, the vast majority of the additional AMI fatalities (2,220) are predicted to involve
senior citizens, reflecting their much higher absolute risk. This highlights the importance of
mechanisms whose effects are not limited to workers.
Income, Work Hours and Industry of Employment

Work hours, income and employment in cyclically sensitive sectors such as construction
and manufacturing rise during economic upturns. In this sample, a one point drop in
unemployment is associated with highly significant increases of 0.3 hours per week, $260 per
person per year, and .08 and .10 percentage points, respectively, controlling for state and year
effects, demographics and state time trends. Since these factors represent plausible pathways
through which macroeconomic conditions might affect AMI fatalities, Table 5 shows the results
of logit models in which they are included as supplementary covariates.
Per capita income, work hours, manufacturing and construction employment shares are
all positively related to AMI fatalities when controlled for individually (see columns b through d
A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart

Page 10

of Table 5), although only the first and last of these approach statistical significance. If the four
covariates are included simultaneously (specification e), the coefficient on work hours falls
essentially to zero but the others are only slightly attenuated. In model (a), a one standard
deviation increase in income, construction and manufacturing employment shares is predicted to
raise the AMI death rate by 2.1, 0.8 and 1.2 percent. The coefficient on unemployment is
reduced approximately 20 percent, in absolute value, compared to the base model (column a),
suggesting that changes in employment patterns and income explain a non-trivial portion of the
overall macroeconomic fluctuation but that other sources, like health behaviors, are even more
important.
Dynamics

Changes in lifestyles or environmental factors may rapidly affect the risk of death from
heart attacks. Even so, the impact of many health inputs seems likely to accumulate over time
(Grossman, 1972), as does the ability of individuals to make adjustments that partially mitigate
the deleterious effects of negative health shocks. Moreover, since unemployment rates are fairly
highly correlated across years (the R2 between the survey year rate and the average over the
preceding five calendar years is .523), the specifications above probably capture the effects of
macroeconomic influences occurring over a period considerably longer than one year.
These issues are examined by estimating models that hold constant the average
unemployment rate during the five preceding calendar years (to proxy medium-term effects) and
deviation of the survey year rate from this five-year average (representing the contemporaneous
impact). The findings, summarized in Table 6, suggest that AMI mortality quickly rises when
the economy strengthens and then increases further if macroeconomic conditions remain robust
over the next several years. A one point drop in current unemployment, relative to the five-year
A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart

Page 11

average, is predicted to raise the full sample AMI fatality rate by 0.8 percent. This compares to
an increase of 2.2 percent for a corresponding reduction during the preceding five years. The
initial and medium-term consequences are similar across race and sex groups but with
particularly large macroeconomic fluctuations again observed for 20-44 year olds.
Information on the adjustment to a sustained improvement in the economy is obtained
from models that separately control for unemployment rates in the survey year and each of the
preceding five years. Appendix Table A.1 shows selected predicted effects of a sustained one
point drop in unemployment, with the full adjustment path summarized in Figures 3 and 4. Since
there is no evidence of important sex or race differences, these subgroups are not shown in the
figures or emphasized in the discussion.
These estimates again indicate that AMI death rates rise in the year the economy expands
and grow further if the lower rate of joblessness is maintained. This can be seen in Figure 3,
where the solid line shows the point estimate of the change in mortality risk and the dotted lines
the 95 percent confidence interval. A one percentage point reduction in unemployment is
predicted to reduce fatality rates by 1.0, 1.1, 1.3, 1.7, 2.1 and 2.3 percent after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
years. This overall pattern conceals sharp age disparities. Figure 4, which displays point
estimates only, demonstrates that the increase in AMI fatality risk is similar for 24-44, 45-64 and
≥ 65 year olds in the year unemployment declines – rising 0.7, 0.8 and 1.1 percent. However, 1,
2, 3, 4 and 5 years later, the risk of death is estimated to have grown by 2.2, 2.6, 3.6, 3.2 and 4.2
percent for 20-44 year olds, which is two to three times as large as the 0.8, 0.8, 1.2, 2.0 and 1.9
percent (1.2, 1.4, 1.9, 2.1 and 2.4 percent) increase for those aged 45-64 (65 and older).
DISCUSSION

A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart

Page 12

Heart attack fatalities rise when the economy strengthens. A one percentage point drop in
unemployment, representing a modest improvement in macroeconomic conditions, is estimated
to raise AMI mortality by 1.3 percent, corresponding to more than 2,500 additional deaths. By
contrast, fatalities from other types of coronary heart disease are little affected and those due to
non-ischemic heart disease either do not change or fall slightly. Increases in the relative risk of
AMI mortality are similar for males and females. The predicted effects are larger for whites than
blacks but the estimates are not precise enough to indicate whether this represents a true racial
disparity or sampling error. Conversely, the growth in risk appears to be greater for 20-44 year
olds than older persons, particularly if the economic upturn is sustained. The higher risk of AMI
death may seem surprising since some researchers have hypothesized that health improves in
good times due to reductions in stress and economic insecurity (e.g. Brenner & Mooney, 1983;
Catalano, 1991). However, these findings are consistent with a growing body of recent research
(e.g. Gerdtham & Ruhm, 2002; Neumayer, 2004; Ruhm, 2000, 2003; Tapia Granados,
forthcoming) showing that health worsens and mortality increases when the economy
strengthens.
This ecological analysis measures how changes in the ambient economy affect individual
AMI mortality. Thus, unemployment rates are used as the proxy for macroeconomic conditions,
rather than to test how becoming jobless affects fatality risk. There is little doubt that
nonemployed individuals are in worse average health than workers, although the direction of
causation is poorly understood and there is mixed evidence on how the risk of death from AMI is
affected (Gallo, Bradley, Falba, Dubin, Cramer, Bogardus et al., 2004; Gerdtham & Johannesson,
2003). Even if unemployment has negative consequences, overall AMI fatalities could increase

A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart

Page 13

when the economy strengthens if these effects are more than offset by higher risk for other
individuals (e.g. because pollution levels or job-related pressures rise).
Two limitations of this study deserve mention. First, the econometric techniques may not
fully account for confounding factors associated with sudden or irregular changes occurring
within states (such as temporary bursts of immigration). Second, different findings might be
obtained using macroeconomic proxies other than unemployment rates or for countries with
different institutional environments than the United States (Gerdtham & Ruhm, 2004; Gerdtham
& Johannesson, 2005). That said, the strategies used here far better control for omitted variables
than those employed in most related previous research.
There are several reasons why heart attack deaths might rise when the economy improves.
First, longer working hours could make it more difficult for individuals to undertake timeintensive health-producing activities such as exercise and consumption of a healthy diet (Chou,
Grossman, & Saffer, 2004; Ruhm, 2004; Sokejima & Kagamimori, 1998). The extra hours also
lead to reductions in sleep (Biddle & Hamermesh, 1990), which is linked to elevated stress,
decreased alertness, greater injury risk, higher rates of obesity and increases in physiological or
psychological symptoms (Sparks & Cooper, 1997). Second, risky activities such as heavy
drinking and smoking rise (Ruhm, 2004; Ruhm & Black, 2002), although for reasons that are not
fully understood. Higher income may play a role in promoting these unhealthy behaviors and has
been associated with increases in deaths from cardiovascular disease (Chang, Marmot, Farley, &
Poulter, 2002). Third, health may be an input into the production of goods and services. For
example, job stress is a risk factor for AMI (Kivimaki, Leino-Arjas, Luukkonen, Riihimaki,
Vahtera, & Kirjonen, 2002; Pickering, Clemow, Davidson, & Gerin, 2003) and may rise during
economic expansions. The health risks in cyclically sensitive sectors like construction and
A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart

Page 14

manufacturing may also be exacerbated by increased hiring of inexperienced workers and
speedups in production (Catalano, 1979; Brooker, Frank & Tarasuk, 1997). In support of these
last two points, this analysis finds that income and the share of construction employment are
positively related to AMI mortality. However, work hours are not consistently linked to heart
attack deaths.
The mechanisms just mentioned are likely to be concentrated among individuals of
prime-working age. Consistent with this, this investigation presents evidence of particularly
large increases in relative risk for 20-44 year olds. Nevertheless, the greatest number of new
deaths is predicted to occur among senior citizens –who rarely hold jobs. This unsurprising,
given their high absolute level of AMI fatality risk, but such “spillovers” highlight the
importance of causal pathways that are not limited to workers. Examples include air pollution
and traffic congestion, that increase with economic activity, are linked to higher rates of CHD
and may have particularly strong effects on vulnerable segments of the population (Braga,
Zanobetti, & Schwarz, 2001; Brunekreef & Holgate, 2002; Clancy, Goodman, Sinclair et al.,
2002; Peters, von Klot, Heier et al., 2004). Increases in the intensity of employment may also
make it more difficult for workers to care for their aged dependents (Vistnes & Hamilton, 1995)
and the geographic migration induced by economic expansions could lead to increased social
isolation or loss of community support, with particularly detrimental impacts for the old and
young (Eyer, 1977; Tapia Granados, 2004).
A rapid response of AMI mortality to fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions is
consistent with strong effects of other short-term factors such as greater heart attack risk on
Mondays, during the winter months, within one day of a rise air pollution or one hour of
exposure to traffic (Clancy, Goodman, Sinclair, & Dockery, 2002; Kloner, Poole, & Perritt,
A Healthy Economy Can Break Your Heart

Page 15

1999; Peters, von Klot, Heier et al., 2004; Willich, Lowel, Lewis, Hormann, Arntz, & Keil,
1994). That said, it makes sense that the effects of sustained changes in the economy accumulate
over time, since health is a durable capital stock that gradually depreciates but is affected by
flows of individual lifestyle behaviors and environmental conditions (Grossman, 1972).
Moreover, higher mortality during transitory upturns does not imply negative effects of lasting
economic progress. Temporary expansions involve more intensive use of labor and health inputs
with existing technologies, whereas permanent growth results from productivity or technological
improvements that may ameliorate costs to health. Reinforcing this distinction, some previous
research finds that temporary income growth worsens health whereas permanently higher levels
of wealth improve it (Graham, Chang, & Evans, 1992; Dustmann & Windmeijer, 2004).
These results obviously do not justify contractionary economic policies but they do
indicate that temporary improvements in the economy need not have uniformly beneficial effects
and imply that some previous advocates (e.g. Brenner, 1984) have overly enthusiastically cited an
assumed procyclical variation in health as an argument in favor of macroeconomic stabilization
policies. On the other hand, clinicians may need to make efforts to identify patients at higher risk
of AMI when the economy strengthens. For instance, this may be an issue for those whose
employment hours, pace of work or job stress have increased, and for groups who are particularly
vulnerable to increases in air pollution or other negative by-products of an improving economy.
Lastly, this evidence demonstrates that many aspects of health are “produced” by activities of
individuals and society in ways that remain poorly understood.

(California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey,
North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Massachusetts, Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, Wisconsin,
Washington, Maryland and Minnesota). Except for the state population, sample statistics weight
the cells by state-year populations. ICD-9 codes are 390-98, 402 and 404-29 for heart disease;
410 for AMI; 411-414 for other CHD; and 390-98, 402, 404, 415-29 for non-CHD heart disease.
Mortality rates are per 100,000 population. Data on work hours, education and industry of
employment are from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and refer to persons 25 and older.
Work hours refer to the week prior to the CPS interview.
