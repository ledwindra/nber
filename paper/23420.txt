ABSTRACT
I generalize a benchmark model of directed technical change to allow innovations and factors of
production (here energy resources) to be substitutes or complements. I show that a dominant
sector is forever locked-in under substitutability but researchers' market incentives can drive a
transition away from a dominant sector under complementarity. In a calibrated numerical
implementation to climate change policy, transitions from coal to gas and then to renewable
energy occur in laissez-faire. Optimal policy uses a subsidy for clean R&D to hasten the
transition to renewable energy and an increasing emission tax to control residual fossil fuel use. A
standalone clean research subsidy is more valuable than a standalone emission tax unless climate
change is especially costly or policy cannot be enacted soon. A standalone mandate to use
renewable energy can also increase welfare by igniting an energy transition, but only if it is
sufficiently large.

Introduction

Economists have long recognized that the first-best climate change policy combines emission
taxes with subsidies for research into clean technologies. If political considerations prevent
policymakers from deploying both instruments, which should they emphasize? To what
degree can one instrument substitute for the other? Models of climate policy that endogenize
innovation have reached sharply different conclusions: some have found that emission taxes
are far more valuable (Popp, 2006; Fischer and Newell, 2008; Hart, 2019) and others have
found that research subsidies are far more valuable (Acemoglu et al., 2016; Greaker et al.,
2018).1 In the recent models, market incentives direct innovation to either fossil or renewable
resources. These incentives act to “lock-in” the initially dominant fossil resource. The only
drivers of long-run change are resource depletion and policy.2 Because we are going to run
out of atmosphere before we run out of fossil fuels, policy aims to escape fossil lock-in and
create clean energy lock-in.
This framing may not be the most apt. Historical experience suggests that technological change, not depletion, has been critical to past transitions between different types of
resources (e.g., Flinn, 1959; Marchetti, 1977; Marchetti and Nakicenovic, 1979; Rosenberg,
1983; Grübler, 2004; Fouquet, 2010; Wilson and Grubler, 2011). On this view, the British
transition from biomass to coal was driven by technologies such as the steam engine, not by
changes in the relative abundance of timber and coal. A model used to study a future transition to renewable energy should allow innovation dynamics thought to drive past transitions
in energy supply. If these dynamics might also drive a transition to renewable energy, policy would focus on accelerating and steering that transition rather than on changing which
resource is locked-in.
I develop the first model with laissez-faire transitions driven by endogenous innovation
decisions. I generate endogenous transitions by generalizing Acemoglu et al. (2012). Each
type of energy is produced by combining an energy resource with specialized machines. For
instance, coal is combined with steam engines to produce mechanical motion or electricity. A
fixed measure of scientists works to improve these machines. Each scientist targets whichever
type of machine provides a more valuable patent. Scientists’ efforts change the quality
of machines from period to period, which in turn changes equilibrium use of each energy
resource from period to period. In Acemoglu et al. (2012), the elasticity of substitution
1

Historically, economists prioritized emission taxes. Schneider and Goulder (1997) favor emission taxes
because they are closer to the primary market failure. Nordhaus (2008, 22) says that proposals to address
climate change by providing research support instead of pricing emissions are “not really serious” and fail
to recognize “the central economic question about how to slow climate change”. Acemoglu et al. (2012)
formally show that temporary research subsidies might be sufficient to manage climate change.
2
Resource economists have long focused on how depletion or exhaustion can induce transitions between
resources (e.g., Nordhaus, 1973; Chakravorty and Krulce, 1994; Chakravorty et al., 1997). The emphasis
on depletion at the expense of innovation dates back to Jevons (1865), who underestimated the scope for
innovation in his famous analysis of the advancing depletion of British coal reserves (Madureira, 2012).

between resources and machines is fixed at unity. Relaxing this restriction, I analytically
demonstrate that innovation-led transitions occur if and only if that elasticity of substitution
is strictly smaller than unity.
Imagine that there are only two types of energy and that one type of energy initially
attracts the majority of scientists and uses more raw resources. I show that three forces
determine how each sector’s share of research and resource extraction changes in the following
period. First, a market size effect attracts scientists to whichever sector uses more energy
resources. By drawing scientists in, this effect increases that sector’s share of resource use in
subsequent periods, thereby attracting even more scientists. This positive feedback between
extraction and research works to lock in whichever sector is already dominant. Second,
a patent quality effect drives scientists to the sector where their patent will cover a higher
quality machine. This effect draws additional scientists to the sector that dominated research
in the previous period, which again works to lock in whichever sector is already dominant.
Third, a supply expansion effect drives scientists away from the sector with higher quality
machines, because these shift out the supply of machine services and thus reduce the price of
machine services. This force pushes scientists away from the sector that dominated research
effort in the previous period. It is the only force that works against lock-in and in favor of
a transition away from the dominant sector.3
The elasticity of substitution between resources and machines determines the relative
strengths of the patent quality and supply expansion effects. When that elasticity is equal
to 1, we have a knife-edge case in which the patent quality and supply expansion effects
exactly offset each other. The research allocation is entirely determined by market size
effects, so whichever sector initially dominates research and resource supply does so forever.
The dominant sector is locked-in, as in Acemoglu et al. (2012) and related literature.4
When that elasticity is strictly greater than 1 (machines are “resource-saving”), demand
3

The forces generating lock-in are similar to those explored in a related literature on path dependence in
technology adoption (e.g., David, 1985; Arthur, 1989; Cowan, 1990). That literature focuses on “dynamic
increasing returns” as the source of path dependence, where the likelihood of using a technology increases
in the number of times it was used in the past (perhaps through learning-by-doing or network effects). In
the present setting, market size and patent quality effects both act like dynamic increasing returns.
4
The Cobb-Douglas assumption dates to early models of directed technical change (Acemoglu, 2002,
2007). Work on climate and directed technical change since Acemoglu et al. (2012) has used variants of
the Cobb-Douglas assumption (Hémous, 2016; van den Bijgaart, 2017; Fried, 2018; Greaker et al., 2018).
Acemoglu et al. (2016) develop a setting in which two types of energy technologies compete in each of
many product lines. Each product line’s production function is Cobb-Douglas. As a result, their setting
again generates strong path dependence or lock-in. Subsequent to the present paper, Acemoglu et al. (2019)
use a Leontief production function and describe a transition when extraction technologies are fixed. In
contrast to the present paper, they predict that renewable resources fully crowd out fossil resources after
the transition, which occurs because renewable energy does not require a costly resource input in their
setting. Hart (2019) mechanically weakens path dependence by modeling knowledge spillovers between
sectors. Innovation interacts multiplicatively with other factors of production, and laissez-faire transitions
are still driven by exhaustion.

for machine services is elastic and the price of machine services does not fall by much as technology improves. The patent quality effect dominates the supply expansion effect. Whichever
sector dominates research and extraction in some period then does so to an increasing degree
in all later periods. The dominant sector is again locked-in.
However, when that elasticity is strictly less than 1 (machines are “resource-using”),
demand for machine services is inelastic and the price of machine services falls by a lot as
technology improves. The supply expansion effect dominates the patent quality effect. In
that case, as the dominant sector becomes more advanced, scientists can begin switching
to the other sector. Eventually, their research efforts raise the quality of technology in the
dominated sector, which begins increasing that sector’s share of extraction via market size
effects. The transition in research away from the dominant sector can thereby induce a
subsequent transition in energy supply.
To explore the implications for climate change policy, I extend the model to allow resource
use to generate carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions eventually raise global temperature and thereby reduce the quantity of final goods produced, all following Nordhaus (2017).5
I calibrate the model to match market data for coal, natural gas, and emission-free renewables (wind and solar), which compete in electricity generation. Outside estimates suggest
that the elasticity of substitution between resources and machines is around 0.4, and I am
unable to match market data for elasticities close to or above 1.
Consistent with dominant popular narratives, I find that a transition from coal to gas is
underway and that a transition from gas to renewables will eventually follow. The delay until
the second transition depends on scientists’ productivity. As described analytically, both
transitions are innovation-led. Transitions in research proceed swiftly and to completion, but
the subsequent transitions in resource use proceed much more slowly and do not eliminate
use of other resources. The slowness and incompleteness of transitions in energy supply align
well with historical evidence (Smil, 2010, Chapter 2). Fossil fuel use persists in laissez-faire
even after the transition to clean energy, eventually warming the planet to dangerous levels.
A policymaker uses a standalone research subsidy to immediately shift all scientists to
the clean sector. This shift ignites an energy transition, allowing the policymaker to phase
out the subsidy over the ensuing decades without pushing scientists away from the clean
sector. However, in contrast to Acemoglu et al. (2012, 2016), the research subsidy cannot
drive fossil resource use to trivial levels and thus cannot control long-run warming.
An emission tax can control long-run warming, but, as in Aghion et al. (2016), only
very large taxes can shift the near-term research allocation.6 The policymaker prefers to
5

This climate-economy integrated assessment model can be seen as extending Nordhaus (2017) to incorporate the present model of energy use and innovation. Abatement cost is fully endogenous in the present
setting, not an exogenously specified function as in Nordhaus (2017) and related models.
6
In fact, I show that an emission tax has an analytically ambiguous effect on the direction of research, as
it both increases the market share of renewables and increases the price of the fossil fuel-using machines that
researchers could sell. Hassler et al. (2020) report a similar result. Quantitatively, higher emission taxes do

3 of 37

Lemoine

Energy Transitions

use a low initial tax that ramps up over time and hastens an energy transition by only
a bit.7 This result contrasts with Acemoglu et al. (2016), where the policymaker has no
choice but to use a high emission tax if it wants an energy transition to occur in the absence
of a research subsidy. Depending on the specification of scientific progress, the optimal
standalone emission tax provides 40–60% of the benefits of the optimal standalone clean
research subsidy.8
The optimal policy combines a temporarily high research subsidy with an emission tax
that starts low and increases over time, eventually increasing quite sharply. The frontloaded
subsidy is familiar from previous models with lock-in, but the tax trajectory is quite different.9 The two policy instruments cannot fully substitute for each other: adding an emission
tax to a research subsidy increases the value of policy by 15–20%. The policymaker uses the
research subsidy to ignite a transition to clean energy and the emission tax to control the
residual fossil fuel use that remains after the transition has occurred. By reducing warming,
a portfolio of the two policy instruments raises later centuries’ consumption to a level that
far exceeds what a research subsidy alone could achieve.
Robustness checks reveal three important caveats to the value of research subsidies.
First, they need to be implemented quickly. If no policy can be enacted for another 50 years,
then the standalone emission tax is up to 50% more valuable than the standalone research
subsidy and can be nearly as valuable as a portfolio of both. Second, research subsidies are
more valuable than the emission tax only if the standalone emission tax does not quickly
shift research to renewables. If the policymaker has a low utility discount rate, then the
policymaker uses a temporarily large standalone emission tax to push scientists to work on
renewables. Emission taxes become at least as valuable as research subsidies. Third, research
subsidies can be substantially less valuable than emission taxes if the policymaker needs to
redirect resource use quickly. When damages are calibrated to an expert survey that implies
greater losses from warming (Pindyck, 2019; Lemoine, 2021), the policymaker uses a high
and increasing emission tax to quickly redirect resource use.
Finally, I explore the implications of directed technical change for a different type of policy
instrument: a mandate to use a minimum share of renewables. Such mandates are common.
redirect researchers to renewables.
7
In showing that emission taxes can hasten an innovation-led transition in supply, I extend recent empirical
evidence that endogenous innovation can increase the emission reductions from a given emission tax (Aghion
et al., 2016; Fried, 2018) or reduce the cost of a given emission cap (Calel, 2020).
8
Hart (2019) finds that emission taxes are more valuable than research subsidies because research subsidies
have difficulty affecting resource use. In that setting, laissez-faire transitions occur only as fossil resources
become exhausted (pg 157). In contrast, laissez-faire transitions in energy supply are here triggered by
transitions in research, so research subsidies more readily affect resource use. Once research subsidies redirect
resource use, they increase consumption beyond what an emission tax achieves.
9
The most comparable work has the tax decline either forever (Greaker et al., 2018) or once lock-in begins
working in renewables’ favor to crowd out use of fossil resources (Acemoglu et al., 2016). See footnote 28
below.

For instance, around 30 U.S. states and the European Union each mandate a minimum
share of renewable electricity. I show that accounting for endogenous innovation responses is
critical to the evaluation of a mandate. Sufficiently large mandates (of 20% or more, as are
commonly implemented) ignite an energy transition by redirecting research effort through
market size effects.10 If we ignored effects on innovation, we would expect more stringent
mandates to bind for longer, but we in fact see the opposite: more stringent mandates
actually bind for less time than do weaker mandates because they ignite transitions more
quickly. Further, welfare is not concave in the stringency of the mandate. Mandates that are
large enough to ignite a transition can provide substantial net benefits even though smaller
mandates impose net costs and still-smaller mandates provide small net benefits. Accounting
for innovation is of first-order importance when evaluating mandates. For instance, mandates
that appear to impose hefty costs equivalent to a permanent 20% drop in consumption when
ignoring effects on innovation can actually provide benefits equivalent to a permanent 7%
increase in consumption.
Formally, I analyze directed technical change when final good production has a nested
constant elasticity of substitution structure that allows innovation to complement other inputs. The use of a Cobb-Douglas aggregator for machines and factors of production dates
to the earliest models of directed technical change (Acemoglu, 2002, 2007). This paper
joins other recent work in noting that Cobb-Douglas assumptions are knife-edge cases with
qualitatively special results (e.g., Alvarez-Cuadrado et al., 2017; Baqaee and Farhi, 2019).
Complementarities between innovation and factors of production may be common. For instance, Grossman et al. (2017) summarize evidence that capital and labor are complements.
The present framework provides one mechanism through which the economy could have
transitioned from an era in which unskilled labor was dominant to the modern era in which
skilled labor is dominant.11 Baqaee and Farhi (2019) summarize evidence of complementarities across intermediates throughout supply chains. The present theory of innovation-led
transitions could thus explain dynamics in manufacturing activity.
The next section describes the theoretical setting. Section 3 analyzes the relative incentive
to research technologies in each sector. Section 4 theoretically describes the economy’s
10

Some have informally argued that such mandates might allow the energy sector to escape lock-in (e.g.,
Lehmann and Gawel, 2013). Formal analyses of this channel typically focus on learning-by-doing as the
mechanism for technological change (Gerlagh and van der Zwaan, 2006; Kalkuhl et al., 2012), which means
that technology matures jointly with energy production. In contrast, here renewable technology begins
maturing before renewables begin “escaping” lock-in. Fischer and Newell (2008) find that renewable energy
mandates are better than renewable R&D subsidies but worse than emission taxes. Clancy and Moschini
(2018) show that mandates can induce innovation but do not analyze dynamics. Johnstone et al. (2010)
report econometric evidence that mandates to produce renewable energy increase patenting activity.
11
Acemoglu (2002) explains how shocks to the relative supply of skilled labor interact with the skill
premium through endogenous innovation, but his model does not explain how the economy could have
transitioned away from an era in which unskilled labor was dominant. I thank Greg Casey for raising this
point.

Setting

I study a discrete-time economy in which final good production uses multiple types of energy
intermediates. Each energy intermediate is generated by combining energy resources with
machines. Resources are supplied competitively. A fixed measure of households works as
scientists, trying to improve the quality of machines used in producing the energy intermediates. Scientists decide which type of machine to work on. The equilibrium allocation of
resources and scientists changes over time as technologies improve. Figure 1 illustrates the
model setup, which I now formalize.
The time t final good Yt is produced competitively from N energy intermediates Yjt , with
j ∈ {1, 2, ..., N }. The final good is the numeraire in each period. The representative firm’s
production function takes the familiar constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form:

k if and only if νj > νk . The parameter  is the elasticity of substitution. The energy
intermediates are gross substitutes ( > 1), consistent with evidence in Papageorgiou et al.
(2017).
The energy intermediates Yjt are the energy services produced by combining resource
inputs Rjt with machine inputs Xjt . Production of energy intermediates has the following
CES form:
σ
 σ−1

σ−1
σ−1
.
Yjt = κRjtσ + (1 − κ)Xjtσ
The parameter κ ∈ (0, 1) is the distribution (or share) parameter. The elasticity of substitution between the resource and machine inputs is σ. I call machines resource-using when
resources and machines are gross complements (σ < 1), and I call machines resource-saving
when resources and machines are gross substitutes (σ > 1). Resources and machines are less
substitutable than are different types of energy intermediates (σ < ).
Machine services Xjt are produced in a Dixit-Stiglitz environment of monopolistic competition from machines of varying qualities:
Z 1
α
A1−α
Xjt =
jit xjit di,

where α ∈ (0, 1) and where an implicit fixed factor of production ensures constant returns
to scale. The machines xjit that work with resource j at time t are divided into a continuum
of types, indexed by i. The quality (or efficiency) of machine xjit is given by Ajit . Machines
of type i are produced by monopolists who each take the price (pjXt ) of machine services
as given (each is small) but recognize their ability to influence the price pjxit of machines
of type i. The cost of producing a machine is a > 0 units of the final good, normalized to
a = α2 .
Scientists choose which resource they want to study and are then randomly allocated to
a machine type i. Each scientist succeeds in innovating with probability η ∈ (0, 1]. If they
fail, scientists earn nothing and the quality of that type of machine is unchanged. Following
Acemoglu et al. (2012) and others, successful scientists receive a one-period patent to produce
their type of machine. In the numerical implementation, each period will be ten years. Using
resource j as an example, successful scientists improve the quality of their machine type to
Ajit = Aji(t−1) + γAji(t−1) ,

Firms that enter into production of resource j find a deposit containing one unit of
the resource. Firms must pay a fixed cost (in units of the final good) to develop the nth
deposit. In equilibrium, all deposits with fixed costs less than pjRt get developed. Order the
continuum of deposits by fixed cost. The fixed cost of the nth deposit is then Fj (n), with
Fj (n) = (n/Ψj )1/ψ for ψ, Ψj > 0. In equilibrium, Fj (Rjt ) = pjRt . As a result,
Rjt = Ψj pψjRt .

(2)

Resources are therefore supplied isoelastically. I say that resource j is more accessible than
resource k if and only if Ψj > Ψk . I impose ψ ≥ α/(1 − α), which ensures that the own-price
elasticity of resource supply is greater than the elasticity of machine services with respect
to the resource price. To isolate the role of innovation in driving transitions, I assume that
the profile of fixed costs does not change over time, as if exploration and innovation in
extraction technologies offset depletion over time. This assumption may even understate the
effectiveness of innovation at offsetting depletion (Schwerhoff and Stuermer, 2019).

Hart (2019) allows for an extensive margin in research. Following Acemoglu et al. (2012, 2016), I keep the
total pool of researchers exogenous so that I can focus on implications of the directedness of technical change
rather than on well-known externalities in the quantity of research undertaken. See page 55 of Acemoglu
et al. (2016) for a discussion.

The equilibrium prices clear all factor markets and all firms maximize profits. If scientists
are employed in any two sectors, they receive the same expected reward from both, and if
they are not employed in some sector, they receive a greater expected reward in some other
sector that has nonzero scientists. Appendix D establishes that the equilibrium is stable in
a tâtonnement sense when N = 2. Throughout, I drop the asterisks when clear.

The Equilibrium Direction of Research

The first-order condition for a producer of machine services yields the following demand
curve for machines of type i in sector j:

xjit =

Ajit .

(3)

The monopolist producer of xjit therefore faces an isoelastic demand curve and accordingly
marks up its price by a constant fraction over marginal cost: pjxit = a/α = α. In equilibrium,
the producer of machine type i for use with resource j earns profits of:
1
1−α
Ajit .
πjxit = (pjxit − a)xjit = α(1 − α)pjXt

If a scientist succeeds in innovating at time t, she exercises her patent to obtain the monopoly
profit πjxit . Her expected reward to choosing to research machines that work with resource
type j is therefore

where Aj(t−1) is the average quality of machines in sector j. This average quality evolves as

A market size effect would appear here if the quantity of the implicit fixed factor differed by sector. I
maintain identical fixed factors in order to focus on market size effects that evolve over time (see equation (10)

Four terms determine scientists’ relative incentive to research machines. The first term
is a patent quality effect that directs research effort to the sector in which scientists will
end up with the patent to better technology.14 The other channels derive from the relative
price of machine services: (pjXt /pkXt )1/(1−α) in equation (6). The supply expansion effect
14

The patent quality effect depends on realized technology (1 + γ)Aj(t−1) , not solely on the increment to
technology γAj(t−1) produced by a scientist’s efforts, which introduces a type of business-stealing distortion.
If γ differed by sector and were very small in the more advanced sector, scientists could have a stronger
incentive to research machines in the more advanced sector even though their efforts would not improve
these machines. This business-stealing distortion vanishes under the assumption of identical γ: by attracting
scientists to the more advanced sector, the patent quality effect here also attracts them to the sector where
they make the greatest advance.

pushes scientists away from the more advanced sector. From equation (8), the supply of Xjt
shifts out when its machines’ average quality Ajt increases, and it shifts out to an especially
large degree when α is small. When σ is small (machines are resource-using), the demand
curve is steep because the marginal product of additional machines is constrained by the
supply of Rjt . By shifting out supply, the increase in Ajt induces a relatively large decline in
the equilibrium price pjXt . However, when σ is large, machines are resource-saving and the
demand curve is relatively flat. The increase in Ajt then induces a relatively small decline
in the equilibrium price pjXt . Improving technology therefore pushes scientists away to a
greater degree when the demand curve is steep (σ is small) or the shift in supply is large (α
is small) because it reduces pjXt more strongly.
Pause to consider the net effect of a relative improvement in sector j’s average technology.
We have seen that this relative improvement attracts scientists through the patent quality
effect and repels scientists through the supply expansion effect. Combining these channels,
the exponent on relative technology is proportional to (σ − 1)(1 − α). The supply expansion
effect dominates the patent quality effect if and only if σ < 1. As σ → 0, demand for
machines becomes perfectly inelastic and the supply expansion effect becomes large. As
σ → ∞, demand for machines becomes perfectly elastic and the supply expansion effect
vanishes. As σ → 1, the two effects exactly cancel, so that the incentives to research machines
in one sector or the other do not directly depend on the relative quality of technology in
each sector.
The remaining machine price channels in equation (10) connect research incentives to
resource supply. In particular, we see research directed towards the sector with greater
resource use. This is a market size effect. It arises for two reasons. First, from equation (7),
an increase in Rjt shifts out demand for Xjt , and does so to an especially large degree when
machines and resources are stronger complements (i.e., as σ becomes small). Second, also
from equation (7), an increase in pjRt (for given Rjt ) also shifts out demand for Xjt as firms
substitute machines for resources. This channel is especially strong when the elasticity of
substitution between resources and machines is large, and it vanishes as that elasticity goes
to zero. Each of these outward shifts in demand for Xjt increases scientists’ incentives to
work on improving machines in sector j. Therefore, the market size effect draws scientists
towards whichever sector is increasing its share of resource supply over time.
Now consider how sector j’s share of extraction changes from time t to t + 1. Combining the intermediate-good producers’ first-order condition for resources with the final-good
producers’ first-order conditions, we find demand for each resource:

Demand for sector j’s resources (for example) shifts inward as the share of those resources

The change in sector j’s share of resource extraction from time t to time t + 1 therefore has
the same sign as the change in sector j’s share of intermediate good production. Observe
that increasing the average quality of technology Ajt increases production of the intermediate
good Yjt . Thus, sector j’s share of resource extraction tends to increase when the average
quality of its technology is advancing relative to sector k. The sector that is advancing more
rapidly tends to attract even more scientists in later periods through market size effects,
which works to lock in that sector’s technological advantage.

The Equilibrium Evolution of Resource Use and Technology

I now study the evolution of the economy in a special case with N = 2. Label the two
sectors as j and k. I show that both the possibility of a transition and the nature of longrun outcomes are sensitive to whether machines are resource-using or resource-saving. I
then study three special cases that highlight the relevant dynamics. Appendix C illustrates
the main ideas with a numerical example. Section 5 will demonstrate the dynamics in a
calibrated application to climate change policy.
The following assumption will be useful for studying transitions. It defines a time t0 in
which sector j dominates research activity with technology that is more advanced than (or
not too much less advanced than) sector k’s technology:
Assumption 1. Aj(t0 −1) /Ak(t0 −1) > [Ψj /Ψk ]θ and s∗jt0 > 0.5 for some time t0 , where θ ,
1/[(1 − α)(1 + ψ)] ∈ (0, 1].
The next lemma establishes one set of structural conditions under which Assumption 1 holds:
12 of 37

Lemoine

Energy Transitions

September 2020

Lemma 1. If νj = νk and Ψj = Ψk , then Assumption 1 holds if (i) Aj(t0 −1) > Ak(t0 −1) and
(ii) either σ > 1 or σ is not too much smaller than 1.
Proof. See Appendix E.4.
The steady state for this economy has the research allocation fixed forever, so each type
of technology improves at a constant rate. Define a transition in research as occurring at
the first time t ≥ t0 at which sjt begins declining, a transition in extraction as occurring
at the first time t ≥ t0 at which Rjt /Rkt begins declining, and a transition in technology
as occurring at the first time t ≥ t0 at which Ajt /Akt begins declining. Finally, define the
dominant resource as being locked-in from time t0 when no type of transition occurs after
t0 .
Begin by considering the case with σ > 1:
Proposition 2. Let σ > 1.
1. If Assumption 1 holds, then resource j is locked-in from time t0 .
2. If s∗jt ∈ (0.5, 1), then s∗j(t+1) > s∗jt . If s∗jt ∈ (0, 0.5), then s∗j(t+1) < s∗jt .
3. The only stable steady states are at sjt = 0 and sjt = 1.
Proof. See Appendix E.5.
If machines are resource-saving, then a transition cannot happen. The economy is lockedin to the dominant sector. The proof shows that sector j increases its share of resource
supply whenever it dominates research effort. And when sector j is both increasing its
share of resource supply and dominating research effort, the market size and patent quality
channels in equation (10) both pull even more scientists towards sector j. Sector j therefore
increases its dominance of research effort over time and continually increases its technological
advantage over sector k. Sector j’s increasing share of resource supply and its increasing
share of research activity form a positive feedback loop that prevents sector k from ever
catching up: sector j’s increasingly improved technology and increasing share of resource
extraction both work to attract ever more scientists to sector j, and the improving relative
quality of technology in sector j works to increase its share of extraction over time. The
economy therefore approaches a corner allocation in research effort.15 These dynamics are
similar to the Cobb-Douglas case analyzed in Acemoglu et al. (2012) and related literature.
The dynamics are qualitatively different if σ < 1. First consider the steady-state research
allocation:
Proposition 3. Let σ < 1. Then the only steady-state research allocation has sjt = 0.5 and
the following are true as t → ∞:
15

The only exception is a knife-edge case in which the initial period’s equilibrium has scientists equally
allocated between the two sectors.

Proof. See Appendix E.6.
The proposition gives four results. First, the economy approaches a steady-state research
allocation in which the average quality of each technology improves at the same rate. The
steady state is both unique and stable.16 Second, if the two resources are of the same
quality and accessibility, then the steady state has identical technology and extraction in
each. Third, if one sector’s resource is of higher quality and more accessible, then that
sector dominates resource use and has better technology. Fourth, extraction eventually
approaches a constant value in each sector. As discussed previously, resource supply becomes
less sensitive to further advances in machine quality as machines becomes more advanced,
so resource use cannot grow at a nonzero constant rate for all time. Observe that the longrun share of each resource is not sensitive to the magnitude of σ. These shares are instead
completely determined by the characteristics of each resource (specifically, Ψj , Ψk , νj , νk ,
and ψ) and by the elasticity of substitution between the two types of energy ().
I now analyze the possibility of transitions with resource-using machines:
Proposition 4. Let σ < 1, and let Assumption 1 hold.
1. A transition in extraction occurs only after a transition in research and a transition in
technology occurs only after a transition in extraction.
2. If resource j is relatively accessible (Ψj ≥ Ψk ), then a transition in technology occurs
while sector j still provides the larger share of resource supply.
3. If νj = νk and Ψj = Ψk , then a transition in research and a transition in extraction
both occur before reaching the steady-state research allocation.
16

A corner allocation cannot persist when σ < 1. The proof shows that as the average quality of technology
in sector j improves, the market size effect becomes negligibly small: resources are not constrained by the
availability of machines when machines become very advanced, so further improvements in their average
quality do not affect resource use very much. Eventually the supply expansion effect dominates not just the
patent quality effect but also the market size effect. Πjt /Πkt then begins to decline. If the allocation of
scientists is held fixed at the corner, Πjt /Πkt eventually falls below unity, at which point the corner allocation
can no longer be an equilibrium.

Proof. See Appendix E.7.
If machines are resource-using, then sector j’s dominant share of research activity works to
push scientists away from sector j through the supply expansion effect in equation (10) even
as sector j’s improving relative technology works to increase its share of resource supply and
thus strengthens the market size effect that pulls scientists towards sector j. The change in
the market size effect is especially significant when sector j’s technology is still immature,
so that sector j can increasingly dominate research effort over time. However, the market
size effect becomes less and less sensitive to the quality of sector j’s technology as that
technology becomes more advanced. The supply expansion effect eventually dominates the
market size effect, which pushes scientists back towards sector k. At this point a transition in
research occurs. As sector j’s share of research continues to fall, a transition in extraction can
occur. The transition in extraction is innovation-led : it can occur only after the transition
in research. Even though research transitions before extraction, sector k does not begin
to dominate research effort (triggering a transition in technology) until sometime after the
transition in extraction, when both the market size effect and the supply expansion effect
work to push scientists towards sector k. Finally, if resource j is relatively accessible, then a
transition in technology must happen while sector j still dominates resource supply. Just as
the transition in extraction must follow a transition in research, so too a change in the sector
that dominates resource supply must follow a change in the sector that dominates research.
The first two parts of the proposition establish that a transition can happen when machines are resource-using. The final part of the proposition describes conditions under which
a transition must happen. The sector with more advanced technology can attract the majority of researchers when neither technology is very advanced. However, the relatively
backward sector must eventually dominate the research allocation because the steady state
has both sectors being equally advanced (see Proposition 3). As the technologies improve,
scientists must eventually start switching towards the relatively backward sector, and we
already saw that extraction must also start switching towards the relatively backward sector
sometime before the relatively backward sector begins to dominate the research allocation.
Transitions in research, extraction, and technology must occur sometime before reaching a
steady-state research allocation.
I next explore three special cases that highlight the competing effects that drive the
evolution of the economy. I structurally ground Assumption 1 in each case.

As previously discussed, the patent quality and supply expansion effects exactly cancel, so
that the market size effect completely determines the evolution of the research allocation.
How does the market size effect evolve over time? Substituting the Cobb-Douglas forms,
equation (14) becomes

in the relative quality of sector j’s technology. The more that sector j advances relative
to sector k, the more that Rjt /Rkt grows, and the more that Rjt /Rkt grows, the more
that Πjt /Πkt shifts up for any given sjt . The equilibrium sjt must therefore increase as
Aj(t−1) /Ak(t−1) increases.17
Using equations (15) and (16) and the result from Appendix D that the total derivative
of Πjt /Πkt with respect to sjt is negative, we have sjt > 0.5 if and only if

If Ψj < Ψk and νj < νk , then Assumption 1 holds when this inequality holds. We now
see how lock-in arises: sjt > 0.5 implies that Ajt /Akt > Aj(t−1) /Ak(t−1) , which ensures that
sj(t+1) > sjt , which implies that Aj(t+1) /Ak(t+1) > Ajt /Akt , and so on. There is a knife-edge
case in which sjt = 0.5 for all time, but if equilibrium sjt ever takes on any other value, then
the economy progresses to a corner allocation in research.
17
This result explains why relative technology does not directly affect research incentives in Acemoglu
et al. (2012): technology matters in their equation (17) via the same patent quality effect seen here (which
they call a “direct productivity effect”) and also through their “price effect”, but substituting in for relative
output prices from their equation (A.3) shows that these two effects exactly cancel. Relative technology
ends up playing a role in their setting’s equilibrium (see their equation (18)) because relative market size
is proportional to the relative quality of technology (see their equation (A.5)). Thus, their Cobb-Douglas
assumption generates the same dynamics as does the Cobb-Douglas case analyzed here.

j attracts all scientists, but this increasing dominance of research activity does not affect
sector j’s share of extraction. There is a knife-edge case in which sjt = 0.5 for all time, but
as with the Cobb-Douglas case analyzed above, if equilibrium sjt ever takes on any other
value, then the economy progresses to a corner allocation in research.

Finally, consider the special case of a Leontief production function for each intermediate
good, which arises as σ → 0.18 In order to aid exposition, fix ψ = α/(1 − α). Let Yjt =

The right-hand term in braces decreases in Ajt , going to 0 as Ajt → ∞. Therefore the
derivative becomes negative as Ajt becomes large. A corner allocation can persist for some
finite interval when Ajt is not too large, but over time the weakening market size effect leads
Πjt /Πkt to decrease as Ajt continues to grow. As established by Proposition 3, a corner
allocation in research cannot persist indefinitely.
Now consider a steady-state research allocation, with sjt = s for all t ≥ t0 . Because a
corner allocation cannot persist, s must be strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than 1.
As t increases, Aj(t−1) and Ak(t−1) become arbitrarily large. From equation (19), we have:

which in turn holds if and only if s = 0.5. Thus, the steady state research allocation must

the steady-state research allocation, with Aj(t−1) > Ak(t−1) if in addition either νj > 0.5 or
Ψj > Ψk . Further, from equation (18), Rjt /Rkt approaches a constant value as t becomes
large and νj ≥ νk with Ψj ≥ Ψk imply Rjt ≥ Rkt , with Rjt > Rkt if either νj > νk or
Ψj > Ψk . These results are familiar from Proposition 3.
Finally, consider an early time t0 at which Aj(t0 −1) and Ak(t0 −1) are much smaller than
Ψj and Ψk , respectively, and the economy is not yet at a steady-state research allocation.

If sjt0 > 0.5, then Aj(t0 −1) /Ak(t0 −1) increases over time and the right-hand side of equation (21) shifts up over time. As a result, sj(t0 +1) > sjt0 . Therefore, sector j can increase
its share of research effort over an interval of time with not-too-advanced technology. The
reason is that the market size effect increasingly incentivizes scientists to work in sector j
(see equation (18)). Eventually sector j’s technology becomes sufficiently advanced that the
market size effect weakens and the supply expansion effect pushes scientists back towards
sector k (see equation (20)). A transition in research thus arises because the sensitivity of
Rjt /Rkt to technological quality diminishes as technology advances, eventually making the
supply expansion effect the primary determinant of research activity for some length of time.

If νj ≤ νk and Ψj ≤ Ψk , then inequality (22) implies that Assumption 1 holds at t0 .

Climate Change Policy

I next use the stylized representation of energy production to generate qualitative insight
into how the possibility of laissez-faire transitions affects climate policy. I focus on use of
coal, natural gas, and renewables, which compete in electricity and heating. Appendix A
details the full model and its calibration.
I extend the theoretical setting in several ways. First, I allow ψ to differ by sector.
Second, I model carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions from coal and natural gas, with other
emissions fixed exogenously. Third, I connect these emissions to global temperature, allow
greater temperature to reduce economic output, and allow for exogenously increasing total
factor productivity, all following the latest (2016R) version of the benchmark DICE model
(Nordhaus, 2017). Finally, I allow a policymaker to use policy instruments to affect the
market equilibrium. This policymaker seeks to maximize intertemporal welfare, which takes
the standard utilitarian, discounted power utility form in per capita consumption. Depending
on the scenario, the policymaker can tax greenhouse gas emissions and/or can subsidize
R&D into renewable resources. In contrast to standard climate-economy models, the cost
of reducing emissions at time t is endogenous: it depends on the supply of each energy
resource, on the time t quality of the machines for using each type of resource, and on the
substitutability of each type of energy for the other.
As described in Appendix A, I set  to 1.8 based on evidence in Papageorgiou et al. (2017)
and Stern (2012) and I set σ to 0.4 based on estimates in Koesler and Schymura (2015) for
the elasticity of substitution between energy and value-added in a panel of countries. Marten
and Garbaccio (2018) map these estimates into energy supply sectors, and Lemoine (2020)
aggregates them into a single energy supply sector. The value of 0.4 is broadly consistent
with related evidence in Okagawa and Ban (2008) and Atalay (2017) and is in the ballpark of
elasticities of substitution used by computable general equilibrium models of energy use (see
Appendix A). Further evidence in support of σ around 0.4 comes from the model’s internal
dynamics: I am unable to match market data for σ much larger than 0.7 (including σ > 1),
σ around 0.7 generate laissez-faire dynamics inconsistent with expectations of gas displacing
coal over time (see Appendix B), and σ much smaller than 0.3 have climate change damages
eventually driving consumption to be negative (with any policy that maintains positive
consumption becoming infinitely valuable).
The parameter γ determines the timing of laissez-faire transitions. I undertake a bounding analysis on γ in order to gain insight into how that timing affects climate policy. In
particular, I explore two values that in practice generate reasonable bounds on laissez-faire
dynamics (see below): allocating all scientific research to a single type of energy doubles the
quality of its technology over a decade in a small advances case (γ = 1) but septuples that
quality in a large advances case (γ = 6). These cases are reasonably consistent with the
range of values implied by related literature.20

I calibrate the resource supply elasticities to a combination of outside data and outside
estimates. I choose the remaining parameters to match market data. In particular, I match
recent levelized costs for each type of energy, recent resource consumption, recent shares
of R&D spending, and recent economic output. When exploring different values for γ, I
recalibrate the other parameters to preserve the match to market data. Appendix A reports
that the initial period’s emission reductions from small to moderate taxes, a non-targeted
moment, are not far from benchmark calibrations.

Laissez-Faire Outcomes

Figure 2 plots the laissez-faire trajectories of research (top) and extraction (middle and
bottom) in the cases with small (left) and large (right) advances. A transition towards gas
occurs over the next decades, with gas proceeding to dominate energy supply for the next
century or more.21 Eventually, a second transition occurs, driving resource use away from
gas and towards renewables. This double transition is consistent with many energy analysts’
discussions of future market dynamics. The transitions are innovation-led, with gas and
then renewables coming to dominate the research allocation decades before they dominate
resource supply. The calibration requires coal to have the most advanced technology and
renewables to have the least advanced technology. The transitions work to narrow these gaps
in turn. The timing of the transition to renewables is sensitive to the rapidity with which
science progresses. The transition occurs just over 400 years in the future (after the end of
the plot) in the case of small advances but occurs only 100 years from now in the case of
large advances.
The optimistic message is that an innovation-led transition to renewables does occur.
The pessimistic message is that it is insufficient to avoid climate catastrophe. The bottom
panels of Figure 2 show that improvements in each resource’s technologies and in total factor
productivity drive a large expansion in total resource use, so that coal and gas consumption
can be substantial even when these resources provide only a small share of total supply.22
And it is the level of fossil resource use that determines emissions and global climate change.
tists improves technology by 426% over 5 years at the initial level of renewable scientists used here, implying
a γ of around 8 for our 10-year timestep. This estimate is close to the large advances cases. In the calibration
of Acemoglu et al. (2019), each scientist expects to advance technology by 11% over 5 years at the initial
level of renewable scientists used here, implying γ of around 0.2 for our 10-year timestep. This value is close
to the small advances cases. Acemoglu et al. (2016) also estimate an innovation production function, but
the mapping to the present paper is less clear.
21
The calibration ignores current policies, which include various subsidies for each kind of research and
resource production and include air pollution regulations (see Acemoglu et al., 2019). The initial decline in
renewables’ share of research might reflect that current policies inflate the initial, calibrated level of research
into renewables.
22
The drawn-out nature and incompleteness of the transitions from coal to gas and from gas to renewables
accord with evidence from history (Smil, 2010, Chapter 2).

In fact, coal and gas use are greater over the next 200 years in the large advances case,
despite the relatively quick transition to renewables.
The left panel of Figure 3 plots warming under each trajectory. Warming from 2015
to 2095 is 3.3◦ C (4.8◦ C) in the case of small (large) advances. These values bracket the
mean projection in the IPCC’s RCP8.5 scenario.23 By 2400, warming reaches enormous
levels, despite the transition to clean energy seen in the case of large advances. The right
panel of Figure 3 shows that consumption per capita increases over the next centuries. In
the case with small advances, consumption per capita subsequently plateaus as growth in
total factor productivity slows and as warming becomes more severe. Further warming then
gradually reduces consumption per capita. In the case with large advances, improvements
in renewable technologies generate a boom that lasts until the losses from warming become
especially severe.24
Calculating the channels from equation (10), the patent quality effect strongly pushes
scientists away from renewables over the next two centuries, but the supply expansion effect
dominates it because σ is less than 1. The market size effect also pushes scientists away
from renewables over the next two centuries. Renewables’ market share does not begin
increasing until after the transition in research is underway. That transition in research
is ignited by the supply expansion effect becoming large enough (because gas technology
becomes advanced enough) to overwhelm both the patent quality effect and the market size
effect. As renewables gain market share, they tilt the market size effect just enough to
attract more scientists to renewables. This shift in the research allocation further increases
renewables’ share of supply, compounding the change in the market size effect and generating
a self-reinforcing process that culminates in renewable resources dominating both research
and supply.25

5.2

Optimal Policy

We have seen that a transition to renewable resources does eventually occur in laissez-faire.
However, that transition is too late to avoid substantial warming, and residual fossil fuel use
after the transition drives further warming. Now consider how a policymaker would control
warming by taxing emissions and/or subsidizing renewable R&D.26
To gain intuition, consider two resources, labeled j and k, with use of fossil resource j
taxed at τt per unit and researchers in clean sector k subsidized at rate ωt . Letting pjRt
23

See Table 2.1 at https://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/topic_futurechanges.php.
In the final period, warming reduces output by 99% in the case with large advances but reduces output
by only 86% in the case with small advances.
25
In the case of large advances, the post-2250 reduction in renewables’ share of research occurs once the
supply expansion effect begins pushing scientists out of renewables.
26
This is a difficult program to solve, involving a bilevel programming problem with both equilibrium and
complementarity constraints. Appendix A describes the solution method.

Increasing τt has ambiguous effects on the allocation of research. On the one hand, by
increasing the consumer price of fossil resources, a higher tax works to increase the price of
fossil machine services and thus to increase the incentive to improve fossil technologies. On
the other hand, by reducing fossil resource use and increasing clean resource use, a higher
tax works to push researchers towards the clean sector through the market size effect.27 In
contrast, increasing ωt works directly to drive scientists towards the clean sector. Through
the right-hand side of equation (23), this effect works to reduce Rjt and to increase Rkt ,
which further drives scientists to the clean sector through the market size effect.
27

If larger τt does increase the clean sector’s share of research, then the right-hand side of equation (23)
falls, further increasing the clean sector’s share of resource use.

The top panels of Figure 4 plot welfare-maximizing policy choices, with emission taxes
on the left and research subsidies on the right. Solid red (hollow blue) lines indicate the case
with small (large) advances. The tax ramps up over time, and does so much faster when the
policymaker cannot also use a research subsidy.28 In contrast, the research subsidy starts
out large but phases out over the next decades. The optimal research subsidy is not visibly
affected by whether or not a tax is available.
The middle panels show how these policies affect the clean sector’s share of research (left)
and of resource use (right). A policymaker uses an emission tax to bring the transitions in
research and resource use slightly forward in time, with the trajectories still qualitatively
similar to the cases without policy. In contrast, a policymaker uses a clean research subsidy
to immediately shift all research activity to the clean sector, which continues to dominate
the research allocation even after the subsidy is withdrawn. The rapid improvement in
technology substantially increases near-term renewable resource use. Renewables’ share of
supply soon approaches 100%, but the level of coal and gas use nonetheless also increases
(as seen in laissez-faire for the case of large advances). Renewables achieve their greatest
share of near-term resource use when a policymaker combines the research subsidy with an
emission tax. In this case, the policymaker can also reduce long-run use of fossil resources.
The bottom panels plot the consequences for global temperature, for the case of small
advances (left) and for the case of large advances (right). All policies limit warming over
the coming two centuries. However, the welfare-maximizing research policy can actually
increase long-term warming unless it is paired with an emission tax: the research policy
can stimulate a transition to renewables that reduces near-term emissions, but it cannot
control the residual fossil fuel use that drives long-term warming. These results indicate
that policy must make fossil resources more expensive, not just make clean energy cheaper,
if it is to limit warming (see also Hassler et al., 2020). The standalone research subsidy
enables much greater consumption than does the standalone emission tax once renewables
dominate supply, after 100 (50) years in the case of small (large) advances. By limiting
warming more effectively, a portfolio of both instruments allows far greater consumption in
later centuries.
We have seen that outcomes are sensitive to the type of instrument that a policymaker
28
This tax is quite different from the most closely related work (although direct comparisons are complicated by previous work not expressing taxes per unit of emissions). Greaker et al. (2018) show that the
model of Acemoglu et al. (2012) implies emission taxes that are low and declining. They also show that an
especially small elasticity of substitution between intermediates can generate an increasing tax, albeit one
that increases at a declining rate (in contrast to the present paper’s sharply increasing tax). The  used
here is between the values explored in Greaker et al. (2018). In Acemoglu et al. (2016), the optimal tax
is hump-shaped. They interpret the declining portion as reflecting the eventual diminished role of fossil
resources (pg 88). In the present setting, lock-in does not work in renewables’ favor to such a degree, so that
substantial fossil use remains even after a transition to renewables. The optimal tax is indeed hump-shaped
over the full 400-year horizon, but the late decline in the tax is here merely an artifact of the policymaker
anticipating the end of the world in 2415.

can use. Table 1 undertakes further comparisons. Figure 4 showed that the end-of-century
tax is larger when the policymaker cannot also use a research subsidy, but the top panel of
Table 1 shows that today’s welfare-maximizing tax is larger when the policymaker combines
the tax with a research subsidy. The tax and research subsidy are complements in the near
term. Figure 4 also showed that renewables’ share of the next decades’ resource use is greater
under a standalone research policy than under a standalone tax policy, but the second panel
of Table 1 shows that the tax policy increases renewables’ share of today’s resource use by a
bit more when scientists take only small advances. In this case, a research policy takes time
to affect resource use.
The most important near-term difference between the policies is their effect on the allocation of research. The third panel of Table 1 shows that an emission tax does direct scientists
towards the clean sector, but the welfare-maximizing tax increases the clean sector’s share
of scientists by less than 1 percentage point.29 In contrast, a policymaker who can use a
research subsidy immediately redirects all scientists to the clean sector.
All policies reduce warming over the century relative to laissez-faire, with the combined
policy reducing warming the most (fourth panel).30 Which of the two standalone policies
most strongly limits warming depends on the nature of scientific advances. If scientists take
only small steps, the standalone tax policy limits this century’s warming by more, but if
scientists take large steps, the standalone research policy limits this century’s warming by
more. Nonetheless, the bottom panel shows that the standalone tax is only 62% as valuable
as the standalone research subsidy when scientists take small advances. And the standalone
tax policy provides a mere 39% of the benefit of a standalone research policy when scientists
take large advances, reflecting that large advances enable research policy to more readily
affect near-term resource use. A policymaker always benefits from adding an emission tax
to a research policy, as the tax increases value by 20% (17%) in the case of small (large)
advances.31
29

Scientists are only slightly responsive to the emission tax. With small (large) advances and a tax of $150
per tCO2 , the clean sector’s share of research is only 0.35 (0.28), not too far above the laissez-faire share of
0.23. See also footnote 34.
30
Laissez-faire temperature in 2115 is similar to DICE-2016R, but optimal temperature is greater than
the value of 3.7◦ C from DICE-2016R. The optimal temperature in the high-damage case below is fairly close
to that in DICE-2016R (see Tables A-3 and A-4). The difference in Table 1 stems from oil emissions being
exogenous here and from the implied marginal abatement cost curve. The exogenous emissions increase year
2115 temperature by 1.4◦ C. With the first period’s technology, the policymaker can here obtain low levels of
emission reductions at less cost than in DICE-2016R but finds high levels of emission reductions to be more
expensive than in DICE-2016R.
31
The truly optimal policy portfolio also includes a subsidy for machine production and the ability to steer
research between coal and gas technologies. Appendix B shows that including the optimal machine subsidy
does not change the primary conclusions. The ability to direct fossil research is unlikely to be important
because the depicted optimal policy does not leave any scientists working on either fossil resource.

Alternate Policymaking Environments

Table 2 reports the effects on welfare of varying the policymaking environment. Appendix B
reports effects on the variables from Table 1 and reports robustness checks involving model
calibration.
The first rows in each panel of Table 2 repeat results familiar from the previous section.
The second rows in each panel delay the implementation of policy for 50 years. From there,
the tax policy is not that different from the base case. However, the research policy does
change. Delay makes it harder for the research policy to shift resource supply because
renewable technologies fall further behind gas technologies in the period of delay.32 The
optimal research policy does not immediately move all scientists to the renewable sector
once the period of delay is over. Because the research policy takes too long to affect resource
use, the standalone tax policy is more valuable than the standalone research policy. In the
case of small advances, the standalone emission tax is 50% more valuable than the standalone
research policy and is nearly as valuable as the combined policy.
The third rows use a lower utility discount rate (pure rate of time preference). The base
specification follows DICE-2016R in discounting utility at 1.5% per year, but this alternate
specification follows Stern (2007) in discounting utility at 0.1% per year. The more patient
policymaker attaches greater weight to losses from future warming. As a result, policy
produces much larger benefits. The initial emission tax is dramatically larger than in the
base specification, now $863 ($751) per tCO2 in the case of small (large) advances. Most
scientists soon work in the renewable sector, and all do within a century. In the case of small
advances, the tax falls over the century as scientists no longer require such a strong incentive.
When a research subsidy is also available, the policymaker uses the research subsidy to shift
scientists and reduces the initial tax all the way to $20 ($11) per tCO2 . Because both policies
soon shift research, the standalone emission tax is now as valuable as (70% more valuable
than) the standalone research subsidy. Combining the two increases the value of the policy
program by around 15% in either case.
The fourth rows calibrate climate change damages to the survey of experts in Pindyck
(2019), as implemented in Lemoine (2021).33 The marginal losses from warming are nearly
ten times larger than in the base specification from DICE-2016R (see Appendix A). Because climate change is much more expensive, the gains from policy are much larger. The
policymaker designs an emission tax that starts off large (around $450 per tCO2 in both
cases) and shifts all researchers to the renewable sector within this century. In contrast to
32

Finding that delaying policy reduces the effectiveness of a research subsidy as the renewable sector falls
further behind echoes Acemoglu et al. (2012, 2016), but here the question is more nuanced. In those papers,
the renewable sector is becoming more locked-in over time. Here delay also brings closer the dates at which
the renewable sector would endogenously begin attracting more scientists and increasing its share of supply.
33
Pindyck (2019) asks experts for the probability of consumption losses from climate change exceeding various thresholds in fifty years. Lemoine (2021) combines the resulting distribution of losses with a distribution
for warming to obtain a distribution of damages per unit of warming.

the case of low discounting, the standalone emission tax increases over the century even for
small advances: the primary rationale for the large tax is here to quickly increase renewables’
share of resource use, not to increase renewables’ long-run share of resource use by shifting
near-term research. As a result, renewables dominate supply by the end of the century
and temperature remains far lower than in any other scenario studied, reaching only 3.6◦ C
(4.1◦ C) in 100 years. And while the initial tax does drop in the presence of a research subsidy
(to around $80 or $100 per tCO2 ), its subsequent trajectory contrasts with the case of low
discounting, very quickly rising to levels comparable to the case of a standalone emission tax
in order to shift resource use. In the case of small advances, the standalone emission tax is
twice as valuable as the standalone research subsidy and is nearly as valuable as the combined policy. When even moderate warming imposes high costs, the policymaker becomes
primarily concerned with shifting resource supply rapidly. The emission tax is better suited
to this task when research takes time to pay off.

5.4

Mandates to use Renewable Energy

I have thus far examined emission taxes and research subsidies, but the possibility of endogenous innovation-led transitions has important implications for policies that mandate a minimum share of renewable resource use. Such policies are common, as around 30 U.S. states
have Renewable Portfolio Standards and the U.S. Congress has considered Clean Energy
Standards.

Dashes indicate cases where consumption eventually becomes

A binding mandate pushes scientists towards the clean sector through the market size
effect. Figure 5 plots the share of renewable resource use under mandates ranging from 5% to
50%. All mandates hasten the transition in resource use. Moreover, the mandates eventually
make themselves nonbinding by redirecting scientists to the clean sector. Mandates of 5% or
10% bind for a long time and only speed up the transition by a bit. An analysis that ignored
innovation would predict that larger mandates would bind for longer, but we instead see
that larger mandates bind for less time. A mandate of 10% retains many scientists working
in the fossil sectors, but the larger mandates leave very few (if any) scientists in the fossil
sectors. The large mandates rapidly improve clean technology, which incentivizes even more
renewable resource use than the mandate requires. Sufficiently large mandates can thus
quickly ignite an energy transition that would have otherwise occurred centuries later.
Mandates might avoid substantial warming, but they are crude instruments. Are they
worth it? Table 3 compares the benefits from various mandates, for cases in which scientists
respond to the mandate (as in Figure 5) and for cases in which scientists are fixed at the
laissez-faire allocation (plotted in Figure 2). Very small mandates (here represented by 5%)
can provide small benefits, but larger mandates that are not quite large enough to ignite
a transition (here represented by 10%) always impose small costs. Intriguingly, still-larger
mandates can provide substantial benefits relative to a no-policy world. In fact, comparing
to Table 1, large mandates can improve welfare by more than even the welfare-maximizing
emission tax policy. The reason for these benefits is twofold. First, the temperature trajectory is more similar to the trajectory seen under the standalone research policy, which
limits warming over this century (but is not effective at limiting long-run warming). Second,
binding mandates substantially increase total resource use, which can increase near-term
consumption. (Very large mandates impose net costs because they distort supply to such
a degree that near-term consumption falls.) Even though mandates can be superior to
standalone emission taxes and standalone research subsidies, they are not superior to the
combination of emission taxes and research subsidies. The best mandates (of 21% and 45%)
provide benefits of 2.6% and 8.0% for the cases of small and large advances, which are smaller
than the benefits of 3.1% and 14.4% reported for the combined portfolio in Table 1.34
Conventional cost-benefit analyses take a static perspective on mandates, analogous to
the experiments with research fixed to the laissez-faire trajectory. We see that such analyses
can be highly misleading. An analysis that ignored endogenous research responses would
34

The mandates demonstrate tipping behavior: the mandates are either large enough to quickly ignite a
transition or they are not. Around the threshold, a small increase in the mandate can lead to a qualitatively
different economic trajectory. As a result, there are two local maxima in welfare, one with a very small
mandate and one with a large mandate. For the same reason, the tax policy can also have two local optima,
one with a tax high enough to quickly ignite a transition (by shifting near-term research) and one with a
far smaller tax. For instance, the former optimum yields a year 2015 tax of $314 per tCO2 in the base
specification with small advances, but the latter optimum yields greater welfare (and thus was the one
reported in Section 5.2). For small advances, the high-tax optimum does yield greater welfare in the cases
with low discounting or high damages.

assess the larger mandates to be rather costly, but we instead see that they can be rather
beneficial. For instance, an analysis that ignored endogenous research responses would predict that a 40% mandate would eventually drive consumption to negative levels in the case
with small advances (effectively generating infinite losses) or would impose severe balanced
growth equivalent (BGE) losses of 20% in the case of large advances. However, the correct analysis would predict minor BGE benefits of 0.69% in the case of small advances and
substantial BGE benefits of 7.4% in the case of large advances. The endogenous response
of research to mandates dominates the welfare evaluation, changing the sign of the welfare
effect even when costs might otherwise appear to be enormous.

Conclusions

We have seen that complementarities between innovation and factors of production are critical to the possibility of innovation-led transitions in factor use. These complementarities
eventually push scientists away from the more advanced sector, and the redirection of scientific effort eventually redirects factor use away from the dominant sector. In a calibrated
numerical implementation, I find that laissez-faire use of energy resources eventually does
transition towards clean renewable resources from emission-intensive coal and gas. Nonetheless, warming reaches dangerous levels because use of coal and gas persists beyond the
transition. A temporary emission tax, a temporary subsidy to clean energy research, and
a temporary mandate to use clean energy can each quickly ignite the transition if they are
sufficiently large, but only emission taxes can control the residual fossil fuel use that remains
after the transition has occurred. Future work should integrate this model of innovation-led
transitions with leading models of resource depletion and of innovation in resource extraction
technologies (e.g., Schwerhoff and Stuermer, 2019) to assess the relative importance of each
mechanism in recent and historical data. Future work should also assess the importance of
complementarities in driving innovation-led transitions in non-energy sectors of the economy.
