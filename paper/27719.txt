Four Stylized Facts about COVID-19

JEL No. C01,C02,C11,I1
ABSTRACT
We document four facts about the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide relevant for those studying the
impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on COVID-19 transmission. First: across all
countries and U.S. states that we study, the growth rates of daily deaths from COVID-19 fell from a
wide range of initially high levels to levels close to zero within 20-30 days after each region
experienced 25 cumulative deaths. Second: after this initial period, growth rates of daily deaths have
hovered around zero or below everywhere in the world. Third: the cross section standard deviation of
growth rates of daily deaths across locations fell very rapidly in the first 10 days of the epidemic and
has remained at a relatively low level since then. Fourth: when interpreted through a range of
epidemiological models, these first three facts about the growth rate of COVID deaths imply that both
the effective reproduction numbers and transmission rates of COVID-19 fell from widely dispersed
initial levels and the effective reproduction number has hovered around one after the first 30 days of
the epidemic virtually everywhere in the world. We argue that failing to account for these four
stylized facts may result in overstating the importance of policy mandated NPIs for shaping the
progression of this deadly pandemic.

Introduction

In the month of March 2020, in many of the hotspots for COVID-19 around the
world, daily deaths from the disease grew very fast — doubling every 2-3 days in
the most severely impacted locations. In contrast, in other locations, early on in
this pandemic, daily deaths from the disease grew much more slowly. This pattern
of high and highly dispersed growth rates of daily deaths from COVID-19 ended
very rapidly. Relatively slow growth or even shrinkage of daily deaths from the
disease was observed in every location that we study 20-30 days after that location
first experienced 25 cumulative deaths, and the dispersion in growth rates of daily
deaths across locations fell even more rapidly. Now, in late July 2020, while di↵erent
locations su↵er widely di↵erent levels of daily deaths from COVID-19, relatively slow
growth or even shrinkage of daily deaths from the disease continues to be observed
worldwide and the dispersion in growth rates of daily deaths across locations remains
at a low level.
In this paper, we document these facts regarding COVID deaths using both simple
data smoothing procedures and a Bayesian estimation procedure that allows us to
construct probability bands around our estimates of the growth of COVID deaths.
We then use an SIR epidemiological model based on that in Kermack and McKendrick (1927) to interpret these data on the growth rate of COVID deaths as indicating that the e↵ective reproduction number of COVID-19, here denoted by R(t),
has fallen from initial values of 3 or more in many locations to levels close to one or
even lower everywhere in the world. We invert a calibrated version of our simple SIR
model to argue that the vast majority of the observed decline in the level and cross
sectional variation of the e↵ective reproduction number has been due to a decline in
the transmission rate of the disease and not due to the progression of the population
towards herd immunity.1 We also report results using more complex epidemiological

The transmission rate of the disease is defined as the average rate at which an infected individual contacts others and spreads the virus to those contacted. The e↵ective reproduction number
R(t) is defined as the average number of secondary cases infected by a single infected individual
during his or her period of infectiousness when there are both susceptible and immune people among

models including one similar to that considered by Fernandez-Villaverde and Jones
(2020) and show that our conclusions about the worldwide decline in the transmission
rate for COVID-19 are not much a↵ected by the choice of epidemiological model.2
This finding of a rapid decline in the transmission of COVID-19 within the first 30
days of the progression of the pandemic in widely heterogeneous countries worldwide
and the persistence of these low transmission rates over the past few months has
important implications for studies of the impact of policy interventions on the progression of this epidemic. Several prominent studies, including Dehning et al. (2020),
Hsiang et al. (2020), and Flaxman et al. (2020), have studied empirically the role
of government-mandated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing the
transmission of COVID-19, and many of these studies argue that these NPI’s had a
large impact on the transmission rate of the disease in the early phase of the pandemic.3 Given the observation that transmission rates for COVID-19 fell virtually
everywhere in the world during this early pandemic period, we are concerned that
these studies may substantially overstate the role of government-mandated NPI’s
in reducing disease transmission due to an omitted variable bias. Moreover, given
the observation that disease transmission rates have remained low with relatively
low dispersion across locations worldwide for the past several months as NPI’s have
been lifted, we are concerned that estimates of the e↵ectiveness of NPI’s in reducing
disease transmission from the earlier period may not be relevant for forecasting the
impact of the relaxation of those NPI’s in the current period, due to some unobserved
switch in regime.
What might this omitted variable or variables be? While we cannot answer this
those contacted by this infected individual. Note that since a person who is no longer susceptible
to the disease does not become infected even if he or she takes in the virus from contact with an
infected individual, the e↵ective reproduction number can vary due to changes in the transmission rate and changes in the portion of susceptible people among those contacted by infectious
individuals.

question ourselves, the literatures in both epidemiology and economics o↵er several
candidates. COVID-19 is not the first epidemic for which transmission rates have
fallen faster than would be predicted by simple epidemiological models. Chowell
et al. (2016) and Eksin et al. (2019) are two of many studies indicating that this
rapid drop in transmission rates is a pervasive feature of human epidemics. These
studies and many others point to two hypotheses as to why transmission rates for
human epidemics might fall rapidly that we argue deserve further study when applied
to COVID-19.
The first of these hypotheses is that humans spontaneously take action to avoid
disease transmission once an epidemic breaks out.4 For COVID-19, a great deal
of real-time mobility and economic data indicate that human social and economic
interactions have fallen substantially across a large number of locations.5 Further
research is required, however, to determine whether this decline in human interactions
is sufficiently large and widespread to account for the apparent decline in transmission
rates for COVID-19 worldwide.6
The second of these hypothesis is that the network structure of human interactions
naturally leads to a slowdown in disease transmission faster than would be predicted
from a simple epidemiological model in which the population interacts uniformly with
each other.7 Further research is required to determine whether a network structure of

human interactions can indeed explain the global decline in transmission of COVID19.
Finally, we must consider the possibility that unexplained natural forces might
account for the observed decline in transmission rates for COVID-19. As discussed
in Moore et al. (2020), the transmission of COVID-19 bears resemblance to that for
pandemic influenza. These authors observe that of eight major influenza pandemics
that have occurred since the early 1700’s (including the Spanish Flu of 1918-19),
seven had an early peak that disappeared over the course of a few months without
significant human intervention. Unfortunately, each of those seven had a second
substantial peak approximately six months after the first. This final hypothesis
suggests that some unobserved natural factor may have driven the decline to date in
the transmission of COVID-19. Clearly, the existence of such an unobserved factor
would complicate empirical studies of the causal driving forces behind COVID-19
transmission.
In this paper, we characterize the empirical regularities in the regional data on
deaths for COVID-19 with a focus on countries and states of the United States that
have experienced more than 1000 cumulative deaths from the disease late July 2020.
This gives us a list of 23 countries and 25 U.S. states.
The data on daily deaths are quite noisy, with substantial day-of-the-week e↵ects,
and large jumps due to revisions in the criteria used to attribute COVID-19 as the
cause of death. We consider two procedures for estimating deaths from these noisy
data.8 The first uses a simple seven-day moving average of daily deaths and a finite
di↵erence to estimate the growth rate of daily deaths.9 In our second procedure, we
fit a mixture of Weibull distributions to the daily deaths data in each region using a
Bayesian estimation procedure described here and in greater detail in Atkeson et al.
8

See Baqaee et al. (Forthcoming) for a third procedure for smoothing the data on daily deaths.
One can plot a seven-day moving average of daily deaths on a logarithmic scale (useful for
measuring the growth rate of this statistic) for a large number of countries and U.S. states here https:
//ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart. One can readily identify virus hotspots early on in the epidemic as
steep curves in these charts. One can also readily see that, more recently, there are no regions with
such rapid growth in daily deaths anywhere in the world from these charts.

(2020).10 This second procedure allows us to compute probability bands around
our estimates of daily deaths as well as the higher order derivatives of daily deaths
that are needed to invert the more complex epidemiological models considered in our
appendix.
We use a simple SIR epidemiological model to interpret these observations on
deaths due to COVID-19 in terms of the e↵ective reproduction number and transmission rate of the disease. In doing so, we invert the model with a time-varying
transmission rate to fit the estimated deaths data exactly.11 In our simple SIR model,
the e↵ective reproduction number is a linear transformation of the growth rate in
logarithms of daily deaths, with the model implied e↵ective reproduction number
equal to one when this growth rate is equal to zero and the slope of the relationship
equal to the average number of days during which an infected individual is infectious to others. With our model inversion procedure, we are also able to recover
an estimate of the evolution of the fraction of the population remaining susceptible
over time.12 With this fraction estimated, we show that the decline in the e↵ective
reproduction number (and its cross sectional variation) is largely due to a decline in
the transmission rate (and a decline in the cross sectional variation in transmission
rates).
In our empirical work, we focus on data on deaths for our estimates of the transmission rates for COVID-19. In this regard, we follow others such as Murray (2020),
Hay (2020), Korevaar et al. (2020), and Flaxman et al. (2020) who argue that data on
COVID related deaths is more accurate than testing data on cases.13 Related work
by Buckman et al. (2020) and Beenstock and Dai (2020) find a large decline in the

This procedure bears some similarity to that used by Murray (2020) who use a mixture of
error functions to model cumulative COVID deaths.

procedure in their estimation of the e↵ective reproduction number in the United States.

We confirm our model estimates of this fraction by comparing them with findings from
widespread serology studies for New York, Connecticut, Louisiana, and Spain.

data on confirmed cases.14 The websites https://rt.live/ and https://covidestim.org
provide estimates of the e↵ective reproduction number for U.S. states using data on
confirmed cases.15 These estimates also show a large and widespread decline in the
e↵ective reproduction number for the disease for all U.S. states.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present our
procedure for interpreting COVID deaths data with an SIR epidemiological model.
We then present our estimation procedures in section 3. We present our findings in
section 4. Finally, we conclude.

Interpreting deaths data with an SIR model

The SIR epidemiological model we use to interpret the data on deaths from COVID19 is as follows.
The population is set to N . At each moment of time, the population is divided into
four categories (states) that sum to the total population. These states are susceptible
S, infected I, resistant R , and dead D. Agents that are susceptible are at risk of
getting the disease. Agents that are infected are contagious and may pass it on to
others through some form of interaction with susceptible agents. Agents that are
resistant are not at risk of getting the disease, either because they have immunity
built up from a vaccine or from previous experience with this or similar diseases.
Likewise, those who have died from the disease are no longer at risk of getting the
disease. We normalize the total population N = 1, so all results regarding S, I, R
and D should be interpreted as fractions of the relevant population.
We use R(t) to denote the e↵ective reproduction number of the disease at date t.
This e↵ective reproduction number is the ratio of the rate at which infected agents
14

See also Liu et al. (2020).
The commonly used method of Cori et al. (2013) for estimating reproduction numbers requires
accurate data on new cases.

infect susceptible agents to the recovery rate of infected agents from the disease at
date t.
The equations of the model can be stated in terms of the e↵ective reproduction
number as
dS(t)/dt = R(t) I(t)
(1)
dI(t)/dt = (R(t)

dR(t)/dt = (1

1) I(t)

⌫) I(t)

dD(t)/dt = ⌫ I(t)

(2)

(3)

(4)

The parameter governs the rate at which agents who are infected stop being
infectious and hence stop transmitting the disease. We refer to this parameter as
the recovery rate. This parameter is considered a fixed parameter determined by the
biology of the disease. We denote the fatality rate from the disease by ⌫.
The parameter (t) is the rate at which infected agents spread the virus to others
that they encounter at date t. We refer to this parameter as the transmission rate.
We define the ratio (t)/ to be the normalized transmission rate. It is standard to
refer to the value of the normalized transmission rate at the start of the pandemic
before any mitigation measures and use of prophylactics are undertaken as the basic
reproduction number of the disease. We denote this basic reproduction number by
R0 ⌘ (0)/ .
We assume that infected agents interact randomly with other agents in a uniform
manner so that the e↵ective reproduction number of the disease is given by the
product of the normalized transmission rate and the fraction of agents who remain

7

susceptible to the disease:
(t)

R(t) =

S(t)
.
1 D(t)

(5)

We see from equation (5) that the e↵ective reproduction number can fall either due
to changes in the normalized transmission rate or changes in the fraction of the
population remaining susceptible to the disease.
To invert this model to interpret data on deaths note that from (4), we have
I(t) =

dD(t)/dt.

Using that the states must sum to one, we have

(8)

To obtain the e↵ective reproduction number implied by deaths data, note that from
equations (2), (6), and the time derivative of this second equation, we have
R(t) = 1 +

1

d2 D(t)
dt2
dD(t)
dt

(9)

where the last term in this equation can be interpreted as the time derivative of the
logarithm of daily deaths.
Note that this equation (9) implies that there is a linear relationship between the
growth rate of daily deaths (here measured as the time derivative to the logarithm
of daily deaths) and the model-implied e↵ective reproduction number. This reproduction number is equal to one when the growth rate of daily deaths is equal to zero.
8

The slope of this relationship is given by 1/ corresponding to the number of days
on average that an infected individual remains infectious. To compute estimates of
the e↵ective reproductive number that are consistent with our estimated paths for
the growth rate of daily deaths, we set = 0.2. This value implies that if the growth
rate of daily deaths is 30 percent initially, the basic reproduction number, the value
of the e↵ective number at date t = 0, is 2.5. These values are inline with CDC
estimates.
Given these equations, one can obtain an estimate of the normalized transmission
rate of the disease from equations (5) and (8). Thus, one can use this estimate to
determine the extent to which the model-implied e↵ective reproduction number has
changed due to changes in the transmission rate versus a reduction in the fraction of
the population remaining susceptible to the disease. For this exercise we also need
to set a value for ⌫. We use the CDC’s preferred estimate of this parameter and set
⌫ = 0.004.

Death Data and Estimation

The data sources for daily deaths are New York Times for U.S. states and Johns Hopkins University for other countries. We select U.S. states and other countries that
have experienced more than 1000 cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 by July 22,
2020. For each location i, our estimation period begins at the location specific date
when cumulative deaths reached 25 in that location and ends on July 22, 2020. The
24 countries that we study are Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France,
Germany, India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Peru,
Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States excluding the states listed next. The 25 U.S. states that
we study are Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi,
Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,

9

South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. The rest of the U.S. is counted
as another region.
One problem that we face is that the data on daily deaths due to COVID-19
is noisy. In many regions, there are both substantial day-of-the-week e↵ects and
occasional large spikes in reported deaths due to, among other things, changes in the
criteria used to classify deaths as being due to COVID-19. To estimate the trend
growth of daily deaths from these noisy data, we assume that the trend path of daily
deaths in each location is given by a mixture of Weibull density functions which we
estimate using a Bayesian procedure.16 We assume that observed daily deaths are
the sum of a mixture of Weibull density functions and a residual whose magnitude
is regime-specific. The regime-switching residuals allow us to e↵ectively deal with
erratic noises in the data. The Bayesian procedure allows us to construct posterior
probability bands around the estimate. It also allows us to derive smooth estimates
of the first and higher derivatives of daily deaths that we need to recover estimates of
the e↵ective reproduction numbers and transmission rates of the disease from several
structural SIR models.
Our estimation methodology begins by scaling the cumulative death data in location i so that Di (t)/(1 + di )Di (T ) lies between zero and one, where Di (T ) is the
cumulative number of deaths in location i at the end of the estimation period and

di > 0 is a scale parameter to be estimated as described in the appendix. Let Di,t

Due to its flexibility, the Weibull distribution is commonly used in survival and failure analysis
to model the time until an event such as death or mechanical failure. See, for instance, Bučar et al.

The left panels of Figure 1 shows the fit of our Weibull estimation to the noisy
daily death data for four selected locations from four di↵erent continents: New York
State, Sweden, Panama, and Iran. These locations span the range of daily death
patterns observed in the data and illustrate that our flexible specification is able
to fit disparate patterns. New York had a steep initial rise in deaths followed by
a decline that slowed considerably over time. Sweden experienced a flatter wave of
deaths. Panama’s daily deaths were nearly flat for several weeks and then began to
rise, a similar pattern to that observed in some U.S. states like Texas and Florida.
Iran, which has struggled to contain the pandemic, was well into a second and larger
wave of daily deaths by the end of our estimation period. The x-axis of these panels

also show the starting date at which each of these regions first reached 25 cumulative
deaths.
The right panels of Figure 1 shows the corresponding estimates for the growth
rate of daily deaths (on the left axis) and the of the e↵ective reproduction number
implied by equation (9) (on the right axis). In these panels, we see the rapid decline
of the growth rates of daily deaths in these locations in the 30 days after each of
these regions reached 25 cumulative deaths.
The smoothed daily death series in the left column of Figure 1 are based on 7-day
moving averages following Baqaee et al. (Forthcoming) using a procedure described
in Appendix A). We present these non-parametric estimates of the trend in daily
deaths as a check on our estimation procedure. As one can see, the 0.90 probability
bands capture most of the movements in the smoothed series. However, the smoothed
series are heavily influenced by large spikes in the noisy daily death data. As a result,
the growth rates of smoothed daily deaths can fluctuate wildly (see Figure A.1 in
Appendix A).

Findings

Our estimation results yield the following four stylized facts about the COVID-19
epidemic.
Fact 1. The growth rate of daily deaths from COVID-19 fell rapidly everywhere
within the first 30 days after each region reached 25 cumulative deaths.
Fact 1 is shown in the top panel of Figure 2. The solid black line shows that
the median estimated growth rate of daily deaths fell rapidly from an initial level of
about 40 percent to zero within the first 30 days of the estimation period. Notice
that the 0.90 posterior probability intervals computed across all locations that we
consider, the dashed lines in the figure, follow a similar pattern.18 The estimated
18

The posterior probability intervals in Figure 2 include both location uncertainty and sampling

12

half-life of the growth rate during this period is 2.7 days with a 0.90 probability
interval ranging from 1.3 to 7.1.
Fact 2. After this first period of rapid decline, the growth rate of daily deaths in all
regions has hovered around zero or slightly below.
As Figure 2 shows, after the initial 30 day period, the median growth rate of daily
deaths has been nearly flat and slightly below zero. The 0.90 posterior probability
interval has also been low relative to its initial range. Notice in the right column of
Figure 1 that the growth rate of daily deaths has followed a pattern consistent with
Facts 1 and 2 in all four of our example regions despite the heterogeneity in both
their geographic locations and daily death patterns.
Fact 3. The cross-regional standard deviation of growth rates of deaths fell rapidly
in the first 10 days of the epidemic and has, subsequently, remained low relative to
its initial level.
Fact 3 can also be seen in Figure 2. The shrinking of the two-thirds and 0.90
posterior probability intervals shows that the dispersion in death growth rates across
locations fell sharply within the initial 10 days of the epidemic. While there has been
some increase in dispersion towards the end of the estimation period, overall levels
of dispersion remain small relative to their initial values.
Facts 1 - 3, when taken together, demonstrate important di↵erences in the patterns
of daily death growth rates early on versus later on in the epidemic. In particular, the
facts indicate that there is a structural break in the COVID-19 death data occurring
roughly 30 days after 25 cumulative deaths occur. Prior to the structural break is a
period characterized by rapidly declining growth rates of daily deaths and high crossregional dispersion. The period after the structural break features growth rates of
daily deaths that mostly hover near but slightly below zero. This latter period also
features substantially less cross-regional dispersion compared to the early period.
uncertainty. However, most of the cross-sectional dispersion in growth rates in the figure is driven
by location uncertainty as sampling uncertainty within a location is small (see the right column of
Figure 1).

13

Fact 4. When interpreted through a range of epidemiological models, Facts 1 - 3
imply that both the e↵ective reproduction numbers and transmission rates of COVID19 fell rapidly from widely dispersed initial levels during the 30 days after cumulative
deaths reached 25. After this initial period of rapid decline, the e↵ective reproduction
number has hovered around one everywhere in the world.
Fact 4 is obtained by deriving the implications of our estimated daily death paths
for the paths of the e↵ective reproduction number and transmission rates using four
variants of an SIR model. The baseline version is described above, and the e↵ective
reproduction number and normalized transmission rates implied by this model are
obtained from the deaths data using equations (8), (5), and (9). The parameter
is set to 0.2 such that a growth rate of daily deaths of 30 percent corresponds to
a basic reproduction number of 2.5. The right y-axis in Figure 2 shows that the
median e↵ective reproduction number fell from an initial level of nearly 3 to 1 in 30
days and has, subsequently, remained slightly below 1.
Equation (5) illustrates that the e↵ective reproduction number can fall due to
both declines in the normalized transmission rate and declines in the fraction of the
population remaining susceptible to the disease. We use our estimated paths for daily
deaths and the equations of the SIR model to determine the relative contributions
of each. We find that the rapid decline in daily death growth rates early on in the
epidemic is primarily due to a rapid fall in the transmission rate of the disease as
illustrated by the bottom panel of Figure 2. Disease transmission rates, like the
e↵ective reproduction numbers, fell early on in the epidemic from widely dispersed
initial levels and and have since remained close to 1.
To explore the robustness of our results to model uncertainty, we consider three
variants of the baseline SIR model: an SEIR model which extends the SIR model by
assuming agents first become exposed to the disease before becoming infectious, an
SIHR model which allows for a longer period between infection and death by adding
a hospitalized state, and an SEIHR model which extends the SIR model by adding
both the exposed state and the hospitalized state. Following a similar procedure as
14

with the baseline SIR model, for each model extension we are able to express the
e↵ective reproduction number as a function of model parameters, as well as, daily
deaths and its derivatives.19
Figure 3 shows that our findings are robust to variations in the baseline SIR
model. The left panel of the figure shows that, across all four model variations,
estimated e↵ective reproduction numbers fell rapidly in the first period before the
structural break. In the second period after the structural break, the median e↵ective
reproductive ratios implied by each model, hover slightly below 1. The first period is
also characterized by more cross-region dispersion in reproductive ratios. The right
column in the figure shows that, regardless of model, the cross-regional standard
deviation of e↵ective reproduction numbers fell substantially within the first 10 days
of the estimation period and, subsequently, remained stable and relatively low.

Conclusion

One of the central policy questions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is the question
of which non-pharmeceutical interventions governments might use to influence the
transmission of the disease. Our ability to identify empirically which NPI’s have what
impact on disease transmission depends on there being enough independent variation
in both NPI’s and disease transmission across locations as well as our having robust
procedures for controlling for other observed and unobserved factors that might be
influencing disease transmission. The facts that we document in this paper cast
doubt on this premise.
Our finding in Fact 1 that early declines in the transmission rate of COVID-19
were nearly universal worldwide suggest that the role of region-specific NPI’s implemented in this early phase of the pandemic is likely overstated. This finding instead
suggests that some other factor(s) common across regions drove the early and rapid
transmission rate declines. While all three factors mentioned in the introduction,
19

Details on these model extensions are provided in Appendix B.

15

voluntary social distancing, the network structure of human interactions, and the
nature of the disease itself, are natural contenders, disentangling their relative roles
is difficult.
Our findings in Fact 2 and Fact 3 further raise doubt about the importance in
NPI’s (lockdown policies in particular) in accounting for the evolution of COVID-19
transmission rates over time and across locations. Many of the regions in our sample
that instated lockdown policies early on in their local epidemic, removed them later
on in our estimation period, or have have not relied on mandated NPI’s much at
all. Yet, e↵ective reproduction numbers in all regions have continued to remain low
relative to initial levels indicating that the removal of lockdown policies has had little
e↵ect on transmission rates.
The existing literature has concluded that NPI policy and social distancing have
been essential to reducing the spread of COVID-19 and the number of deaths due
to this deadly pandemic. The stylized facts established in this paper challenge this
conclusion. We argue that research going forward should account for these facts when
assessing how important NPI policy is in shaping the progression of COVID-19.

Estimation Details

The procedure we use to estimate the trend in daily deaths with a seven day moving
average is as follows. Let Di (t) denote the reported data on cumulative COVID
deaths in region i at date t and Di,t = Di (t) Di (t 1) denote the data on daily
deaths. We estimate the level of daily deaths from these noisy data with a 7-day
moving average
6

á
Di,t =
Di,t s ,
7 s=0
starting from the day t0,i at which cumulative deaths in region i, Di (t), first reaches
25. We then smooth the growth rate of daily deaths with a finite di↵erence
1 ⇥
ḡi (t) = á á
Di,t+3
7 Di,t

⇤
á
Di,t 4 .

The choice for computing the growth rate of daily deaths from a 7-day di↵erence in
smoothed daily deaths is to smooth estimates of the growth rate represented by ḡi (t)
(double-smoothing).
In Section 3, we discuss potential problems with the method of smoothing daily
deaths over 7 days because such a smoothed series is still heavily influenced by large
and noisy spikes of reported daily deaths despite the smoothing. Figure A.1 shows
how wild the fluctuation of growth rates of 7-day smoothed daily deaths for all 50
locations can become.
By contrast, our Bayesian approach avoids the erratic movements driven by noisy

the day-to-day growth rates and the right panel plots the rolling smoothed day-to-day growth rate
over the 7-day period. Both plots are based on a time series of 7-day average death numbers. Due
to this smoothing, time 0 corresponds to the fourth day after the cumulative death reached 25 in

that each column of Qk sums to one. For our deterministic SIR model to o↵er an

We impose a Bayesian prior on the parameters of this model. Let p(✓i ) denote
the prior pdf. We keep the prior di↵use enough to be agnostic. Specifically, ai has
the Gamma distribution with the hyperparameter values 40 and 1 and bi with the
hyperparameter values 4 and 1. The parameter ci has the normal distribution with
mean zero and variance 10. The parameter i,kt has the uniform distribution between
0 and 0.1.20 The weight parametrer wi,j (j = 1, · · · , J ) and the elements of Qk all

The linear regression literature only uses the inverse Gamma distribution for i,kt as conjugate
prior. For our nonlinear regression here, the inverse Gamma prior is no longer conjugate. Moreover,
since the death data implies that the values of i,kt are far less than one, the inverse Gamma prior
only with no moments can cover such small values. This makes the inverse Gamma prior not only
undesirable but also impractical.

The left column of Figure 1 in the main text reports estimation results for four
selected locations. For all other locations, the fit is as good as Figure 1.21 The
computation is expensive: it takes about 24 hours to finish 100,000 posterior draws
for each location. There are a total of 50 locations. We use a cluster of computers
to accomplish this task with a total of 5 million posterior draws. For each posterior
draw of ai , bi , and ci , we invert the four SIR-related structural models to obtain
the e↵ective reproduction number and transmission rate. The computation is also
expensive if the number of estimated Weibull functions is greater than one. For a
mixture of two Weibull functions, for instance, solving each structural model with

Extensions of the SIR model

In this section we describe the three extensions of the standard SIR model that we
consider.

B.1

SEIR model

The SEIR model extends the SIR model by assuming agents first become exposed to
the disease before becoming infected (infectious). At each moment in time, the population N is divided into five states: susceptible S, exposed E, infected I, recovered
R, and dead D. Susceptible agents are at risk of becoming exposed to the disease.
Agents in the exposed state are not infectious but transition to the infectious state at
rate . Note that 1/ is the average number of days that an agent has been exposed
to the disease but is not yet infectious.
The equations of the model are given by
dS(t)
=

R(t) I(t),

dE(t)

(B.1)

(B.5)

As in the SIR model, the e↵ective reproduction number of the disease is
R(t) ⌘

(t)

S(t)
.
1 D(t)

We assume that E(0) = R(0) = D(0) = 0, S(0) is slightly below N and I(0) is
slightly above 0.
The model can be inverted as follows. As before, we have from equations B.4 and
B.5 that
dR(t)

dt
⌫

Integrating this expression over time and using the initial conditions D(0) = R(0) = 0

dt
and di↵erentiating this equation we have

Thus, from equation B.3, we have

1 1 dD(t)

.
⌫ dt
⌫
dt2
Using the constraint that categories sum to one gives
S(t) = 1

E(t)

I(t)

R(t)

D(t).

Note that the model implications for the numbers infected and recovered are the same
as the SIR model. The number still susceptible, however, is adjusted to account for
the stock of exposed agents.
35

Now consider the e↵ective reproduction number. Note that if we sum equations
B.2 and B.3, we get
dE(t) dI(t)
+
= [R(t) 1] I(t).
dt

Di↵erentiating the equation for E(t) and plugging the other expressions in to the
equation above gives

Notice that the e↵ective reproduction number is now a function of both the first and
second derivatives of daily deaths.
We choose the two parameters and so that the model is consistent with typical
observed doubling times of daily deaths early on in the epidemic and a basic reproduction number of around 2.5. If we have daily deaths growing exponentially in the
early phase of the epidemic with growth rate , then
dD(t)
= exp(d¯ + t).

From our formula for the e↵ective reproduction number above
R(0) = 1 +

.

We set to 0.5 which implies that the average number of days between exposure
and infection is 2. The recovery rate is set at 0.4. At this value, a 30% growth
rate of daily deaths (doubling time of 2.3 days) corresponds to a basic reproduction
number of 2.8.

36

B.2

SIHR model

We now extend the SIR model by adding a state H corresponding to hospitalized.
This additional state allows for a longer period from infection to death than in the
simpler SIR model. Infected agents flow from state I to either hospitalized, H, or
recovered, R. Agents in state H can flow to death, D, or recovery, R. At each
moment in time, the total population N is divided between the five states: S, I, H,
R, D.
The dynamics of the model are given by
dS(t)

where the definition of the e↵ective reproduction number, R(t), is the same as in the
SIR and SEIR versions of the model. Note that the parameter ⌫ is now the fatality
rate conditional on hospitalization and ⌘ is the fraction of the infected population
that ends up hospitalized. The parameter ⇣ determines the duration of hospital
stays. For initial conditions, we assume that D(0) = R(0) = 0, S(0) is slightly below
N , I(0) is slightly above 0, and H(0) may be greater than 0.
We now show how to invert this version of the model to express the e↵ective
reproduction number in terms of total deaths and its time derivatives. From equation

As in the SEIR model, the reproductive ratio depends on daily deaths and both its
first and second derivatives. It also depends on the rate at which agents transition
out of hospitalization, ⇣. We set this rate to 1/7 such that the average duration
of hospital stays is one week consistent with values reported on the CDC website.
We choose so that our model is consistent with observed doubling times of daily
deaths in the early phase of the epidemic when the basic reproduction number in the
model is in line with CDC estimates of R(0) = 2.5. If we have daily deaths growing
exponentially in the early phase of the epidemic, then
dD(t)
= exp(d¯ + t),

R(0) = 1 +

which is the same expression as for the simple SIR model. Thus, we set = 0.2,

growth rate of new deaths, = 0.3, corresponds to a basic reproduction number of
2.5.

39

B.3

SEIHR Model

The SEIHR model extends the SIR model by adding both the exposed state E and
the hospitalized state H. In this version of the model the total population N is
given by the sum of susceptible agents in state S, exposed in state E, infected in I,
hospitalized in H, recovered in R, and dead in D. The dynamics of the model are

Notice that the reproductive ratio now depends not only on the first two derivatives
of daily deaths but also the third derivative.
To calibrate the parameters , , and ⇣ we proceed as before. The parameter ⇣ is
set to 1/7 so that the average duration of a hospital stays is 7 days in line with CDC
reports. The parameters and are set to 0.4 and 0.5. These are the same values
used in the SEIR version of the model. This combination of parameter values implies
that a 30% growth rate of new daily deaths corresponds with a basic reproduction
number, R(0), of 2.8.
