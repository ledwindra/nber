Commodity Export Prices and the Real
Exchange Rate in Developing Countries:
Coffee in Colombia

ABSTRACT

In this paper a model that analyzes the interaction between changes
in commodity export prices, money creation, inflation, and the real exchange

rate in a developing country is developed. The model is then tested using
data for Colombia. A number of experts have argued that the fluctuations of
Colombia's real exchange rate have been mainly determined by world coffee
price changes, with more observers emphasizing the consequences of coffee

price changes on money creation and inflation. The results obtained indicate
that coffee price changes have indeed been closely related to money creation

and inflation. Also, coffee price changes have been negatively related to the
rate of devaluation of the crawling peg. These results indicate that in
Colombia, the real appreciation resulting from coffee price increases has been
accommodated, partially by money creation and partially by an adjustment in
the nominal exchange rate.

COUNTRIES: COFFEE IN COLOMBIA
by

Sebastian

I. INTRODUCTION

Changes in commodity export prices will generally have an Important

effect on real exchange rate behavior. Under most conditions, a commodity
export boom will result in a real appreciation of the domestic currency, with
the extent of this appreciation depending, among other things, on whether the

change in export prices is perceived as being temporary or Permanent: Most
recent work on the interaction between commodity export prices and real
exchange rates has focused on the long—run real effects of changes in export
prices, analyzing how resource—based export booms will affect the real
exchange rate, wages, employment and output in the long run.

1

However,

changes in commodity export prices can also have important short-run monetary

effects, which will spill over to the real exchange rate. For example, a
resource—based export boom will typically result in a balance of payments

surplus and in the accumulation of international reserves. If this increase
in reserves is not fully sterilized, the monetary base will increase, and

inflation will tend to result. This increase in the price level will, in
general, be one of the mechanisms through which the real appreciation will
actually take place.

It is possible, however, that the short—run increase in

—2—

the rate of inflation exceeds what is required to bring about the equilibrium

real appreciation generated by the export boom; in this case, the real
exchange rate will appreciate in the short run by more than what real factors

only would indicate. 2 These short—run monetary effects of commodity export
booms have recently been important in a number of developing countries,
including Indonesia, Kenya and Colombia.
In spite of the importance of understanding the mechanisms through

which changes in commodity export prices are transmitted into real exchange
rate changes, very few empirical studies have tackled this subject.

In this

paper a model that analyzes the interaction between commodity export prices,

money creation, inflation and the real exchange rate is developed and

tested. The empirical analysis focuses on the effects of changes in coffee
prices on the real exchange rate in Colombia. A number of experts have argued
that fluctuations in Colombiats real exchange rate have been mainly determined

by world coffee price movements, with most observers emphasizing the conse-

quences of coffee price changes on money creation and inflation. Since 1967,
Colombia has had a crawling peg exchange rate system, where the rate of
devaluation of the peso is determined according to the behavior of a set of

indicators, which, presumably, includes the world price of coffee. Also, for
a long time Colombian authorities have tried to implement policies aimed at
reducing the effects of (temporary) changes in coffee prices on the real
exchange rate.

The paper is organized in the following farm. In Section II, the
behavior of the real exchange rate and coffee prices in Colombia is briefly

reviewed. In Section III, a model that explicitly takes into account the
monetary and inflationary impacts of coffee price movements is presented and

—3--

estimated.

The model also includes an equation for the rate of adjustment of

the nominal exchange rate, or rate of crawl. The results reported in that
section indicate that changes in (world) coffee prices have been positively
related to money creation and inflation, and negatively associated with the

rate of devaluation of the nominal exchange rate in Colombia. In Section IV,
some concluding remarks are presented. It is argued in this section that the
approach taken in this paper is useful for analyzing other cases where
•ommodity export prices and the real exchange rate have been closely related.

II, COFFEE AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE IN COLOMBIA: AN OVERVIEW

The performance of the Colombian economy has been traditionally
linked to the behavior of the world coffee market.

A number of authors have

argued that changes in the world price of coffee have been transmitted into
Colombia mainly through the effect that they have on the real exchange rate.

(Weisner 1978, Urrutia 1981, World Bank 1984.) Increases (decreases) in the
world price of coffee have generated real appreciations (depreciations) of the

Colombian peso. These variations in the real exchange rate, in turn, have
affected the degree of competitiveness of the non—coffee tradables sectors,
with a real appreciation generating losses of competitiveness or exchange rate

deprotection. For example, the recent coffee bonanza of 1975—1979 resulted in
a sharp real appreciation, which negatively affected the ability of the

domestic sector to compete in international markets. Earlier episodes of
sharp increases in the price of coffee (1950, 1954 and 1956, for example) have
also been related to steep appreciations of the peso (Weisner 1978, World Bank

1981.Y In Table 1, data on real exchange rates, coffee prices, and terms of
trade in Colombia between 1952 and 1982 are presented. Table 2, on the other

Notes: The real price of coffee is defined as the US$ coffee price deflated by the
[JS$ import price index. The effective exchange rate was computed using
trade weights and taking into account Colombia's ten major trade partners.

The paitners (and weights) are: US (0.507); UK (0.047); France (0.037);
Germany (0.163); ttaly (0.033); Netherlands (0.044); Japan (0.058); Sweden

(0.032); Spain (0.035); and Venezuela (0.045). According to the definitions
of real exéhange rate used in this paper an increase in the index reflects. a

real depreciation, whereas a decline in the index represents a real appreci-

ation. The raw data were taken from the IFS.

hand, contains data on money creation, international reserves growth, the rate

of devaluation and inflation for 1968—1982. In Figures 1 and 2, two
alternative indexes of the real exchange rate and coffee prices are depicted.
In principle, changes in the price of coffee will affect the real

exchange rate through at least two channels. First, an increase in the price
of coffee will result in a higher disposable income, and in an increase in the

demand for tradable and nontradable goods. To the extent that the price of
other (non—coffee) tradables is given by their world price and the exchange
rate, this income effect will result in a higher relative price of non—

tradables, and in a real appreciation of the peso. Second, and more important
in the Colombian case, an increase in the price of coffee will tend to gene-

rate a balance of payments surplus, and an accumulation of international

reserves. If this increase in international reserves is not fully sterilized,
the monetary base will also increase, and inflation will tend to result with

the consequent further appreciation of the peso. 6 For example, as the data
in Table 2 show, the 1975—79 coffee bonanza generated a steep increase in

international reserve holdings and in money creation. Regarding this
particular (1975—79) episode, Urrutia (1981) has said:

"The increase in coffee prices started to produce increases in
money supply which were.., not neutralized rapidly enough ...

But

by 1976 all conceivable measures were taken to restrict money

supply growth and to compensate for the growth in the monetary

base caused by the growth in international reserves... ll these
measures, however, were insufficient, and money supply increased
by 3U.7 percent."

(page 217).

Since World War II, the Colombian authorities have tried to use
several schemes to reduce the impact of changes in coffee prices on the real

exchange rate and on the rest of the economy. Thi main objective of the
government during this period has been to reduce the undesirable short—run

effects that temporary changes in coffee prices have on the degree of profitability, production and employment in the rest of the economy.

For many

years returns from coffee exports have been subject to a lower net rate of

exchange. Also, in the past, the degree of import protection was altered
depending on the behavior of coffee prices; it was reduced as a consequence of
increases in the price of coffee, and raised when the world price of coffee

declined. In addition, several monetary measures ——

including

steep increases

in the banking system reserves requirements —— have been implemented when the

price of coffee has risen. For example, during the 1975—79 coffee bonanza, a
novel mechanism, supposedly to reduce the monetary impact of the higher coffee

price, was implemented. In 1977, the maturity of the certificates of exchange
——

which are government certificates received by exporters when they surrender

their foreign exchange -— was significantly lengthened. In that way, the

monetary effect of the coffee boom was delayed, but not avoided. 8 (Weisner
1978.)

Many experts have indicated that the adoption of a crawling peg
system In 1967 responded to the need to reduce the dependence of the real
exchange rate on coffee prices fluctuations. (Weisner, 1978, Urrutia, 1981,

Ocampo, 1983.) However, since the inception of the crawling peg system, the
decisioa on the rate at which the peso should be devalued has been highly

influenced by coffee prices. For example, according to Weisnér (1978), once
the crawling peg was adopted, one of the main problems was to decide "at what-

pace to devalue when coffee prices rise" (page 203). This problem has been
compounded by the existence of a trade—off between the rate of nominal de-

valuation and inflation. In practice there has been an inverse relationship
between the rate of devaluation of the peg and coffee prices. This relation
can be seen in Table 2. The high coffee prices of 1976—79, for example, were
accompanied by a significant slow—down of the rate of devaluation; when the
price of coffee began to fall in 1980—82, the rate of the crawl was rapidly

accelerated. This inverse relationship between world coffee prices and the
nominal rate of devaluation constitutes another mechanism -the money creation inflationary effect ——

in

addition to

through which higher (lower) coffee

prices have been translated into a lower (higher) real exchange rate.

Even though these measures —— changes in the level of protection,
variations in maturity of the exchange certificates, and so on -— have helped

reduce the degree of volatility of the real exchange rate, they have not
eliminated its close dependence on the price of coffee. However, since coffee
prices are not the only determinants of the real exchange rate, during some

periods its movement has mainly responded to other variables. For example,
between 1968 and 1973, changes in the real exchange rate were to a large

extent the result of the reduction of the degree of import protection and of

the imposition of an export promotion scheme. (Diaz—Alejandro, 1976.) The
opening—up of the Colombian economy carried out during this period resulted in
a smooth real depreciation of the peso.

III. COFFEE, MONEY, INFLATION AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE IN COLOMBIA

In this section, a model that can be used to analyze the way in which

coffee prices, money creation, inflation and the real exchange rate interact
is presented and estimated. A central purpose of the ;iodel is to formally
test whether, as it has been casually discussed by a number of authors,
changes in coffee prices have indeed been related to money creation and in-

flation in Colombia. Also, the extent to which the manipulation of the rate
of devaluation of the exchange rate has responded to coffee price changes is
empirically investigated.

The model is quite simple and its structure allows

us to concentrate on the problem at hand without being sidetracked into other
issues. An obvious cost of' this strategy is that the adoption of such a

simple structure results in the necessity of imposing some simplifying
assumptions.

111.1 The Model

The model concentrates on the effects of changes in (world) coffee

prices on money creation, inflation and exchange rate adjustment. The model,
presented in equations (1) through (11), assumes that there are three goods in
the economy ——

coffee

Cc), nontradables (N) and other (i.e., non—coffee)

tradables (T). It is also assumed that, as it has been the case in Colombia
since 1967, this economy has a crawling peg exchange rate system, where the

noninal exchange rate Is adjusted periodically according to the behavior of a

set of indicators. Regarding the capital account, it is assumed that due to
the existence of capital controls it is exogenously given.

and V are parameters.

Equations (1) through (14) represent the monetary side of this simple

model. Equation (1) states that the percentage change in the nominal quantity
of money is a weighted average of the rate of growth of domestic credit and of

international reserves. Equation (2) gives the rate of growth of domestic
credit.

It is assumed that, as has been the case in Colombia since World War

II, domestic credit creation is closely linked to the fiscal deficit.
(Weisner 1978, Edwards 1983, World Bank 1983, 19814.) with respect to the
deficit it is assumed, in this version of the model, that it is exogenous.

This, however, is not the most appropriate assumption for the case of
Colombia, where there is some evidence that the deficit and the price of

coffee have been negatively related; lower coffee prices have usually
resulted in larger deficits, stemming (partially) from an increase in the

-1 14—

government's financial assistance to coffee growers.

It is also assumed

that domestic monetary policy can be influenced by other factors besides the

Fiscal deficit. These factors are summarized by the term Zt. Equation (3)

depicts

the behavior through time of international reserves. According to

this expression, reserves movements respond to two elements. First, an excess
(flaw) demand or supply for money will be (partially) reflected in accumulation or decurnulation of reserves. Second, changes in the (domestic) price of

coffee in period t will be translated, in the same period, into corresponding changes In reserves. 10 The novelty of this formulation is that,
contrary to most monetary models of open economies, it explicitly allows for
international reserves shocks to be a source of money creation in the short

(14) presents the rate of change of the

nominal quantity of money demanded, where for simplicity it is assumed that

the real demand for money is a function of real income only. This assumption,
however, is relaxed below where the expected rate of inflation is also
included as an argument in the demand for money equation.

i

is

the

elasticity of the (real) demand for money with respect to real income.
Combining equations (1) through (4), the following equation for the rate of

growth of money in period t is obtained:

=

u)6 Mti ÷

wB

+

u6 y +

÷ (1—u)

(12)

Since w and e are smaller than one but positive, the convergence
of (12) will be oscillatory. According to equation (12), then, a positive
coffee price shock (i.e.,

> 0 )

will

result in a short—run increase in the

—15—

rate of growth of money. However, it is easy to verify from this equation
that in the steady state (i.e., when Mt =

Equations (5), (6) and (8) form the inflation block. According to
(5), the domestic rate of inflation is a weighted average of the rate of
change of tradables and nontradable domestic prices; this equation assumes

that the price of coffee is not included in the price level. According to
equation (6). the rate of change of the domestic price of non—coffee tradables
is equal to the rate of devaluation plus the world rate of tradables In-

flation. Equation (8), on the other hand, states that the rate of change of
the price of nontradables will denend on the rate of change in the price of

tradables, on changes in real income, and, in the short run on the excess flow

supply for nominal money in period t. 12

Combining (4), (5), (6) and (8) the

following expression for the rate of inflation is obtained:

the other hand, the coefficient of real income growth can be either negative

or positive, depending on whether Afl

Equation (9) is the rule of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate,

or rule of crawl. It is assumed that the rate of devaluation in period t
will depend on the rates of domestic and foreign inflation, on the rate of
growth of real income, on the world price of coffee and on other variables,

like commercial policies, captured by Xt. The values of the Is parameters

will determine the type of crawl rule chosen by the authorities. If I = 1,

authorities dontt take into account the behavior of world coffee prices to

1 means that

the authorities recognize the effect of changes in coffee prices on the real

exchange rate, and try to (partially) accommodate them through adjustments in

the nominal exchange rate. Since growth in real income will generate (through
equation (8)) a positive pressure on the price of nontradables,

has been

incorporated in equation (9) as a possible determinant of the rate of the

crawl. In this way, the government is allowed to accommodate the real
appreciation resulting from higher growth through the manipulation of the rate

of devaluation. Equation (10) is the rate of growth of real income, and it Is
formed of two components: a term that is independent from world coffee prices

behavior () and a term that depends on coffee prices ——

An

increase in the world real price of coffee generates a higher real income.

Finally, equation (11) is the definition of the real exchange rate. This
particular definition of e has been chosen, since It has .a close empirical
counterpart. Alternatively, the real exchange rate could be defined as
All the qualitative effects discussed in this section will
also hold for this definition of the real exchange rate.

The model works in the following way. An increase in the (real)
world price of coffee results in higher real income (through equation (10),

and in an increased demand for nontradables. This higher demand, in its turn,
affects, through equation (8), the relative price of nontradab].es. This is

the spending effect of a commodity export boom. (Corden 1982, Edwards and
Aoki 1983.) Independently of monetary or nominal exchange rate behavior, the

—17—

higher price of coffee generates a real appreciation. Let's turn now to the
money side. The higher price of coffee, with its resulting higher real income
and price of nontradables, affects both the demand and the supply for money.
From equation (14), a higher demand for nominal (and real) money will result.

According to equations (3) and (1), however, after the export boom, the rate

of growth of money creation dill also be higher. Depending on the value of
the parameters involved, a higher price of coffee can result in either an

excess flow supply or demand for money. The more plausible case of a
resulting excess supply for money will be considered here. Through (8), this
excess supply of money will impact the nominal price of nontradables, further

appreciating the real exchange rate. 13 What is the role of the rule of crawl

in this story? Two things will happen according to equation (9). First, as a
result of the higher coffee price, the rate of the crawl will be slowed down
in period t, helping to accommodate the real appreciation generated by the

spending effect. This will happen through two channels:

and —i2tr.

Second, there will be a terdency to (partially)

compensate the nominal exchange rate for the higher rate of Inflation, through
The final effect will be a real appreciation resulting, partially,

from the slowing down of the rate of the crawl and partially from higher

inflation. If the liquidity or money creation effect generated by the higher
price of coffee Is large enough, the real appreciation can be larger in the
short run than in the long run.

Equations (9), (12) and (13) can be solved for Mt •

terms of exogenous variables only. These solutions can then be combined with
to formally find the reduced form for the actual rate of change in the

real exchange rate. An inte'esting property of this model is that under an

variables that closely resemble what is observed. Under the simplifying

From equation (1k) it is possible to find out, among other things,
how an increase in the world price of coffee will affect the actual real

exchange rate in period t. Let's first look at the term A1. This term will
capture the spending effect of a change in the price of coffee on the real

—19—

exchange rate. Since stability requires that A > 0,

will, as expected, generate a real appreciation. 15 Let's now turn to the
inflation and exchange rate effects of the higher price of coffee on the real

exchange rate in t. This is captured by term A2. As can be seen from this
expression, there are three different channels, in addition to the spending

effect, through which changes In coffee prices will affect e. Two of these
channels indicate that a higher price of coffee will generate a real apprecia—
—

tion.

16

Ac*
The third channel, however, suggests that e and p

are

positively

related. Let us first look at the forces that suggest that there is a
'0*
negative effect of p

on e

First, a higher world price of coffee results

in an increase in international reserves and money growth in the same period

(see Appendix I). Assuming that, as a consequence, an excess flow supply for
money results, this will generate inflation and, with other things given, a

real appreciation. Second, according to e4uation (13),an increase in the
world price of coffee slows down the rate of the crawl. This also works
towards generating a real appreciation, with other things given. The forces
that tend to generate a real depreciation as a consequence of the increase in
the world price of coffee are of a second order magnitude, and work through

the following channel. The higher world price of coffee reduces the rate of
the crawl and consequently, through equation (13), the domestic price of

tradables and inflation. These lower rates of inflation and devaluation, in
turn will tend to result in a lower rate of domestic money creation, through

equation (12), and even lower inflation. This tower inflation, of course,
will generate, with other things given, a real depreciation. However, given
the second order nature of this effect, the strong presumption is that under
normal circumstances (I.e., under plausible values of the parameters

—20—

involved), the appreciation effects will dominate. This is, however, an
empirical issue, which will be resolved with the estimation of the model. 17
It should be noticed that the model presented here has used some

simplifying assumptions, including the exogeneity of DEBt. It is also assumed
that the exchange rates applied to coffee and to other external transactions

change at the same rate. In Colombia, however, during some years a dual
exchange rate system has been in effect, with coffee's net exchange rate

changing at a sonewhat different rate than the rest of the economy's exchange
rate (Weisner, 1978).

The model presented above does not allow to distinguish between the
effect of coffee price changes perceived to be permanent from those perceived

to be temporary. There are several possible ways in which the model can be
amended in order to allow for this distinction. The simplest way to do this
is by incorporating expected inflation as an argument in the demand for money
equation:

=

y' et

(15)

where e is the rate of expected inflation, defined as
C

log P1—lo Pt ] and Et is the expectations operator. It is assumed

that expectations are rational and formed conditional on all the information

available up to the period t. When equation (15) is used as representing the
demand for money function, equation (lIT) for the change in the real exchange
rate becomes equal to:

The main difference between the new real exchange rate equation (16)

and equation (1'O is that in (16) an expected inflation term

appears.

This is a crucial difference, since as can be seen in equation (17)

is a

function, among other things, of all future expected changes in the price of

—22—

coffee. That is, once the role of expectations is incorporated into the
model, the change in the real exchange rate will depend on the complete
expected future paths of the price of coffee and other exogenous variables.

Now, for example, if the change in the price of coffee is expected to be
permanent, the change in the real exchange rate will correspond to that

already discussed above (equation (14)). However, if the higher price of

coffee is expected to last for one period only, E (P )

—P

and, as

equations (16) and (17) show, the real appreciation in period t will be
smaller than under the case of a permanent increase in the price of coffee.

Another important characteristic of equation (16) is that it is not necessary
for the price of coffee to actually increase to generate a real appreciation.
If world coffee prices are expected to increase in the future, a real
appreciation will now take place.

111.2 Estimation
In this section, the results obtained from the estimation of a slight
variant of the model given by equations (9), (12) and (13) are presented.

Since, from an empirical perspective it is difficult to make a distinction
between temporary and permanent changes in the price of coffee, the results

reported here do not take into account this difference. 19 The estimation was
performed using annual data for 1952—1980, with an explicit distinction made
between the pre—1967 period and the post—1967 period. The following variant
of the money creation equation (12) was estimated (where the

The system given by equations (18), (19) and (20) was estimated using

two and three stages—least—squares for 1952—1980. The results obtained are
presented in Tables 3 and 1• As may be seen, these results are very satisfactory; Most of the coefficients have the expected signs and are significant at
the conventional levels.

The most interesting result from the estimation of the money creation
equations is that they confirm the hypothesis that higher (domestic) prices of

coffee have resulted in short—run increases in the rate of money creation. As
discussed above, the mechanism through which this takes place, is the accumu—
lation of international reserves that are monetized by the Central Bank. Also,

estimates of the coefficients of the lagged Ms suggest that the effect of
changes in coffee prices on money growth have some persistence through time.

The estimation of the money growth equation (18), then, provides stflistioal
support to the claim made by numerous authors (i.e., Weisner 1978, Urrutia
1981) that in Colombia the ability to perform monetary policy has been ham—
pered by the dependence of money creation on the behavior of coffee prices.

Also, these results support the hypothesis that the process of money creation
in Colombia has been critically influenced by the behavior of the fiscal side

of the economy. (Equations (18.1) and (18.2).) An increase in the fiscal
deficit -— measured as a proportion of lagged base money --

in

10 percentage

points has resulted, on average, in an increase tn the rate of growth of money

of approximately 1.8 to 2.2 percentage points. This finding points out that
the separation of the fiscal and monetary sides in traditional macroeconomic

analysis might not be fully applicable to LDCs. In developing countries —-

and especially in Latin America ——

fiscal

deficits are usually financed by

printing money; the LM and IS curves are not fully independent.
The estimation of the inflation equation (19) also yielded interest-.

ing results. With the exception of income growth and the dummy variable, the

coefficients are significant and have the expected signs. The coefficient of
Mt Indicates that, with other things given, an increase in the rate of money

creation by 10 percentage points has resulted in an increase of inflation of

approximately 7 percentage points. On the other hand, according to the

coefficient of (Et +

P)

a higher rate of devaluation and/orhigher world

inflation, will be passed in almost one third to price increases. 20 As the

model indicates, the price of the coefficients of Mt d (Et+ P) are not
significantly different from one. However, the coefficient of real income
growth was, in all runs, insignificant.
The exchange rate adjustment equation (20) yielded, in some sense,

the less satisfactory results. The estimation indicates that for the post—
1967 period ——

after

the crawling peg was adopted —— and with other things

given, theexchange rate tended to be adjusted by less than the ongoing domestic rate of inflation. However, these results also confirm the hypothesis

-27—

that the Colombian authorities have taken into account the behavior of world
coffee prices when deciding by how much to devalue the nominal exchange

rate. Lcwer (higher) world coffee prices result in higher (lower) rates of
devaluation of the crawl. Given the relatively poor results obtained from the
estimation of (20) several alternative specifications of the exchange rate

adjustment equation were also tried. Some of the results obtained are presented in Table 5, where

is the percentage change in the real value of

international reserves measured in dollar terms. The nonsignificance of the
coefficient of this reserves change variable confirms Urrutia's (1981)ccrr
tention that the Colombian authorities do not directly take into account the

levelof international liquidity when deciding by how much to devalue the

nominal exchange rate. The negative and insignificant coefficient of Mt
however, is in some sense a surprise since it has been argued that changes in

the nominal stock of money have been an important Indicator when deciding th
rate of devaluation of the peso (Urrutia 1981). Even though these regressions
do not represent a significant improvement over those reported in Tables 3 and
4, they do confirm that the rate of devaluation has been positively related to
the domestic rate of inflation ——

with

an average coefficient around one ——

and negatively related to the behavior of the world price of coffee.
The point estimates obtained from the regression analysis of (18)
through (20) can be combined to get an approximate idea of the way in which

coffee price changes will affect the real exchange rate. For example, from
the estimates reported in Table 3, the impact effect of world coffee prices on
inflation, nominal devaluation and the real exchange rate, assuming all other
exogenous variables given, are:

As may be seen these numbers are quite large, suggesting that, on

in substantial changes in inflation, the rate of devaluation and

increase in world coffee prices most of the resulting real appreciation will

problem with this exercise, however, is the assumption of other things
given.

As discussed above, coffee price movements are likely to be related to

some of the variables which we have considered exogenous. In particular,
coffee price movements will result in changes in real income, the fiscal

deficit and world inflation. In addition, since no distinction between
temporary and permanent changes has been used in the estiniaticn, the results

from this exercise should be interpreted with caution.

The model incorporated the traditional

spending effect of a commodity export boom and explicitly took into account

the monetary effects of changes in commodity prices. In particular, and
contrary to most Dutch Disease models, the iiodel developed in this section

explicitly allows for changes in the price of coffee to affect, in the short

run, the rate of growth of money. The results obtained from the regression
analysis were, in some sense, surprisingly good, and confirmed the basic

hypothesis that higher (lower) coffee prices result in higher (lower) rates of

growth of money, and consequently in higher (lower) rates of inflation. Also
the regressions show that the rate at which the authorities have adjusted the
exchange rate in Colombia has been negatively related to coffee prices:
higher (lower) coffee prices resulted in slower (faster) rates of devaluation.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

With increasing regularity, the exchange rate is being pointed out as

one of the most important economic variables in developing countries. In
fact, nowadays it is almost impossible to discuss macroeconomic policy prob-

lems in LDCswithout addressing exchange rate issues. From a policy perspective, one of the most important problems is determining whether the real

exchange rate in a particular country is out of line with respect to its equi—
libriun value. 21

To the extent that the real exchange rate is tn fact

misaligned, policy actions geared towards reestablishing equilibrium will be

called for. 22 From a policy viewpoint, then, a crucial aspect of real
exchange rate analysis is to distinguish between equilibrium and

—31—

disequilibrium movements of these rates. Only in this way will it be possible
to implement appropriate policy measures.

In spite of the obvious policy importance of analyzing the mechanism
through which real exchange rate movements take place, very few empirical

studies have tackled this problem. In this paper, the more specific problem
of the effect of commodity export price changes on the real exchange rate has

been investigated empirically. In Sectton III, a model that relates coffee
price changes to money creation, inflation and the rate of devaluation was

developed and estimated for Colombia. A virtue of this model is that it highlights two of the channels that have been traditionally pointed out in casual

discussions on the effect of commodity price changes on the real exchange

rate money creation and inflation and the rate of adjustment of the nominal
exchange rate (i.e., the rate of devaluation of the crawling peg).

The model shows that commodity export booms will generally generate

short—run increases in money creation, inflation and a real appreciation. In
fact it is possible that the real appreciation generated through this channel

exceeds the "equilibrium" real appreciation resulting from the boom. U this
boom is perceived as temporary, the real appreciation will be smaller, but

could still be significant. An important question that arises within this
context is whether there are mechanisms that would allow the authorities to

reduce the impact of the changes In commodity export prices or the real

exchange rate. Although the model presented in this paper suggests that some
mechariismscould actually be made available, none of them is easy to implement

or free of problems. First, open market operations could be used to sterilize
the monetary impact of changes in coffee prices. A problem with this type of
option in developing countries, however, is that local capital markets have

—32—

not reached the stage of development required to perform massive dpen market
operations. A second alternative would be to manipulate commercial policy in a
way to reduce the fluctuation of the real exchange rate.

If commodity export

prices, however, are highly volatile, this option will be to a large extent

impractical. Finally, another alternative is to open the capital account,
allowing the short—run excess liquidity generated by the export boom to he

solved.through outflows of capital. A problem with this measure, however, is
that by fully opening the capital account, other sources of instability could
result. 23

The model presented in this paper was empirically tested for the case
of coffee in Colombia. The results obtained indicate, that coffee price
changes have indeed been closely related to money creation and inflation.
Also, coffee price changes have been negatively related to the rate of deval-

uation. These results indicate that in Colombia, the real appreciation
resulting from coffee price increases has been accommodated, partially by
money creation and inflation, and partially by an adjustnent in the nominal

exchange rate. The model used in this paper has been deliberately kept small
and simple. As a result, it has been possible to clearly pinpoint the role of
coffee in the inflationary and devaluation process. A cost of this approach,
however, has been that some simplifying assumptions have been made. 21

FOOTNOTES

1.

Much of this work has been done in the context of Dutch-Disease models.
On this type of models see, for example, the survey by Corden (1982).

2.

On the monetary effects of commodity export booms,

Harberger

see, for example,

(1983), Edwards and Aoki (1983), Neary (198'1), and Neary and

van Wijnbergen (198U. Notice that an export boom will also generate an
increase in the demarri for money. Inflation will result only if the
liquidity effect of the commodity boom exceeds the increase In the

quantity of money demanded. On this see Edwards and Aoki (1983).
3.

Moreover, very few papers have discussed the mechanism through which real
exchange rate changes actually take place following changes in commodity

export prices. Under floating exchange rates, fluctuations in the
nominal exchange rate are the main mechanism. Under fixed exchange
rates, however, the real exchange rate adjustment will require a change
in the price level (more exactly in the nominal price of nontradables)

and in the stock of money. In a more general case, the adjustment could
be distributed between inflation and nominal exchange rate changes. An
important question, and one that has not yet been tackled, refers to
defining the most efficient mechanism to bring about the real exchange

rate adjustment. Another Important problem, which has not been analyzed
in detail, refers to the desirability of allowing the real exchange rate
to appreciate when the commodity export boom stems from a temporary hike
in export prices.

On the Colombian economy see, for'exam'ple, Diaz—Alejandro (1976), Ocampo

(1983), Weisner (1978), Kamas (1983), World Bank (1983a, 1983b). Some
recent studies, however, have analyzed empirically the relationship

between the terms of trade and the real exchange. See, for example,
Diaz—Alejandro (198Z1), and Edwards (1984a).
5.

Coffee represents approximately 55 percent of Colombia's foreign earnings

from legal exports. It is important to notice that the presence of
important illegal exports makes the empirical analysis of Colombia's

external sector quite difficult. For obvious reasons there are no
reliable data on the magnitude of these illegal transactions. On the
importance of illegal exports in Colombia see Junguito and Caballero
(1978).
6.

The increase in the world price of coffee will result in a higher real

•

income and consequently in a higher demand for money. Inflation will
result
•

only if the accumulation of reserves exceeds the increase, in the

demand for

argued

money (Edwards and Aoki, 1983). A

that in 1975-79 the

required

number

of authors have

resulting inflation largely exceeded what was

to accommodate the equilibrium real appreciation (tieisner, 1978,

World Bank 1984).
7.

To the extent that

there are adjustment costs, rigidities and inflexi—

bilities, short—run real exchange rate movement generated by temporary

swings in commodity export prices can indeed result in adverse (i.e.,
welfare reducing) effects. See Edwards and Aoki (1983).
8.

On the institutional arrangements used, for coffee marketing and exporting
in Colombia, see the detailed description in World Bank

(198U).

9.

On credits to coffee growers and fiscal deficit3 see Weisner. (1978,

p. 186). Another sicp1lrication in ()

is

that it does not explicitly

allow for sterilization by linking reserve changes to credit creation.
However, to the extent that DEHt is negatively related to coffee prices,

an indirect channel to trigger (partial) sterilization is allowed. On
sterilization in Colombia see Kamas (1983).

10. Notice that another simplifying assumption of this model is that it
ignores the demand for international reserves. For the Important role
played by reserves demand in Colombia see Weisner (1978, Ch.1). See also
Diaz—Alejandro (1976). For a discussion on the integration of the demand
for reserves theory and monetary equilibrium, see Edwards (1984b).
11.

A reason to ignore interest rates in the demand for money function is
that there are no reliable data on interest rates in Colombia for the

entire period considered in this study. See however, the discussion
below. On interest rates behavior in Colombia since 1963 see Edwards
(1985).

12.

This equation can be derived from the equilibrium condition in the
nontradable goods sector. See Edwards (198ZTc).

13. Notice that the assumption of an exogenously given capital account plays
an important role here.

If, on the contrary, there is perfect capital

mobility, the incipient excess supply for money resulting from the higher
coffee price would be rapidly eliminated through the capital account,
without affecting the price of nontradables.

11L Equation (1U gives the actual short—run, and not necessarily the equilibrium long—run, change in the real exchange rate resulting from a

change in coffee prices. In order to find the long—run effect, the real

—39—

side

equations (10), (8), (7) and (11) have to be solved under the condi-

tions of monetary equilibrium.

15. See Appendix I. Notice that the real appreciation will take place if the
following (plausible) conditions hold:
p ) Al.

w(e 4- i) C 1;

K 1

and

These are sufficient conditions.

16. Diaz—Alejanclro (19814) reports results from regression of the level of the

(log of the) real exchange rate and a set of explanatory variables for
Colombia and other Latin American countries. For Colombia the coefficient
of (the log of the) terms of trade was significantly negative (—0.56) as
expected. See also Edwards (198'4a).

17. From equation (13) it is also possible to find how changes in the other
exogenous variables, like the fiscal deficit, affect the real exchange
rate.

18. There are two other ways to Introduce the difference between penanent
and temporary changes of coffee prices: (a) changes in permanent income,
instead of actual real Inoome, can be used in equation (8); and (b) in
the crawling peg equation the coffee price changes term can be split in
two; one corresponding to changes perceived to be temporary, the other
for changes perceived to be permanent.
19. See, however, Cumby and van Wtjnbergen (19821).

20. These results are consistent with those obtained by Hanson (1982).

See

also Edwards (19811c). The money growth equations were also estimated for
shorter periods of time. •The results obtained confirm those reported in
this paper. See Volume II of World Bank (19814).

21. For example, Clirie (1983) has recently pointed out that in many LDCs real
exchange rate misalignments contributed to the international debt crisis.

22. on real exchange rate disequilibria and policies to realign them see, for
example, Williamson (1983), Artüs and Knight (1984) and Edwards (1984a).

23. This is not necessarily the case. On the effect of opening the capital
account of the balance of payments in developing countries, see Edwards
(198'ia) and Obstfeld (1980).

2. A possible interesting extension of this model would be to incorporate an
explicit equation for the current account, deriving from it the equili-

brium real exchange rate. Even though this is not a difficult thing to
do theoretically, the empirical implementation would become much mare
difficult.
