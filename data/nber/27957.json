    "abstract": "\n\nDid trade integration suppress inflation in the United States? Conventional wisdom says \u201cyes,\u201d based on the disinflationary supply-side impacts of trade. We argue that these supply-side arguments are incomplete, because trade integration also influences aggregate demand. Our analysis leverages two facts: trade integration was a long-lasting, phased-in shock, and offshoring accounts for a large share of it. Given these facts, we show trade integration is inflationary in conventional New Keynesian models. This result continues to hold when we account for US trade deficits, the pro-competitive effects of trade on domestic markups, and cross-sector heterogeneity in trade integration.\n\n",
