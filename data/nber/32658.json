    "abstract": "\n\nLucas and Stokey (1983) motivated future governments to confirm an optimal tax plan by rescheduling government debt appropriately. Debortoli et al. (2021) showed that sometimes that does not work. We show how a Ramsey plan can always be implemented by adding instantaneous debt to Lucas and Stokey\u2019s contractible subspace and requiring that each continuation government preserve that debt\u2019s purchasing power instantaneously. We formulate the Ramsey problem with a Bellman equation and use it to study settings with various initial term debt structures and government spending processes. We extract implications about tax smoothing and effects of fiscal policies on bond markets.\n\n",
