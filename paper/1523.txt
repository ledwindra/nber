NBER Working Paper #1523
December 1984

Have U.S. Corporations Grown
Financially Weak?

ABSTRACT

The feeling
has

is widespread that the financial strength of U.S. corporations

eroded over the past twenty years. This trend is often blamed on some

combination of the tax system, inflation and overly optimistic assessments of
business risk.

This paper examines recent corporate financing developments from a
long—run perspective.

It is concluded that these developments appear less

dangerous when viewed in the context of the twentieth century as a whole than

when viewed in the context of the post—World War II years. A second major

conclusion is that powerful corrective mechanIsms are at work to keep
corporate financial positions from becoming too risky. These forces have been

particularly noticeable over the past ten years,

Third, the effects on

business financing of the tax system, inflation and business risk are
difficult to trace in the aggregate data, and these effects may be less
straightforward than has commonly been thought. Finally, it is argued that

the degree of economic instability and the relative level of federal
government borrowing will be key determinants of future corporate financing
patterns.

HAVE U.S. CORPORATIONS GROWN FINANCIALLy WEAK?

The feeling

is widespread that the financial strength of U.S. corporations

has eroded over the past twenty years.1 The apparent increase in debt financing,
especially short—term and floating rate debt, has alarmed many observers.

Declining liquidity ratios and heavy reliance on external funds have also caused

concern. These trends are typically blamed on some combination of three factors:
the tax system, which is said to favor debt over equity financing; inflation,

which causes internal funds to lag behind total needs and which is alleged to
make debt cheap; and overly optimistic assessments of business risk.
This paper examines corporate financing developments of the past two decades

from a long—run perspective. Recent years' trends are compared with those for
the twentieth century as a whole in an attempt to shed some light on the follow-

ing questions: Is it true that corporations have increasingly relied on external

funds of all kinds, especially debt? Are the trends of recent years unusual in
light of prior years? What causes long—run patterns in corporate finance? Rave
U.S. corporations indeed become financially weak?
Section 1 of the paper uses a variety of data sources to determine what
financing trends have actually occurred over the twentieth century. Special

emphasis is placed on the problem of accurate measurement during

inflationary

periods. Section II examines the ability of taxes, inflation and perceived
business risk to explain these financing trends. The impact of federal government
borrowing on the financing decisions of the business sector is also considered.
Section III summarizes the paper's findings and attempts to identify the key
determinants of future developments in corporate financing.

Corporate Financing Trends, 1900—1983

A. Debt Ratios
Perhaps the most commonly—used measure of financial condition is

some form of debt ratio, computed with ordinary accounting data. For
the U.S. corporate sector as a whole, such data are available from the
Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income for the years 1926—81 and from

this data the ratio of long—term debt to total capitalization is graphed in
(FIG. 1

Figure 1.

It is easy to see from this figure why there is a widespread

feeling not only that corporate debt usage has increased steadily in the
years since World War II but that it has reached historical peaks in

recent years.2 Perhaps less widely appreciated is the apparent fact that
the rise in debt ratios ceased in the early 1970s. One might conclude
from Figure 1 that U.S. corporations were increasingly willing to take
on financial risk in the postwar years but that debt ratios have remained
stable at a new higher plateau for roughly the past decade.

However, the accounting data on which Figure 1 is based are subject
to several potential biases and should be interpreted with caution.

Liberalization of depreciation allowances, as has occurred at several
points from the 1960s onward, increases corporate cash flow but reduces

measured profits and retained earnings. Thus debt ratios will tend to
be overstated when allowed depreciation is increased. Inflation also
causes distortions in accounting data. Reported asset values may be
understated in an inflation, resulting in overstated debt ratios. Likewise,
standard accounting data do not reflect decreases in the real value of debt
and

reported

debt ratios may thus exaggerate the real burden of corporate

liabilities. On the other hand, accountin data have not traditionally

included such off—balance sheet items as lease obligations and unfunded
pension liabilities, so reported debt ratios may also contain some understatements.3
(FIG. 2
HERE)

Figure 2 tracks the movement of two alternative debt ratio calculations

that attempt to correct for some of the biases in standard accounting data.
The first of these is an estimated ratio of the market value of debt to the
market value of total capitalization of U.S. nonfinancial corporations.
The underlying data are taken from Holland and Myers (1979), who estimated
market values for debt and equity by capitalizing total corporate interest

and dividend payments at current market yields. The market value ratio
should

adjust for inflation—induced valuation changes and thus provide a

more accurate measure of the burden of corporate debt. The primary disadvantages of
it

this measure are that it is subject to estimation error, and

does not allow separation of actual corporate financing decisions from

changes

in market

valuation.

As shown in Figure 2, the market value debt ratio is more volatile
than the book value ratio. It does, however, exhibit somewhat the same
general pattern. Corporate debt ratios were relatively high in the l930s
and early l940s but they declined markedly by the end of World War II.
There then appears to have been an upward trend in the postwar period,
although the market value data suggest that much of the upward movement

took place in the late l960s and early l970s, Finally, this rise in the
debt ratio leveled off in the mid—1970s, with declines occurring in the
most recent years.

The second ratio graphed in Figure 2 is an estimated ratio of the
market value of debt to the replacement value of assets for U.S. nonfinancial

corporations. Like the market value data, the replacement value estimates
are aimed at eliminating inflationary distortions. Another advantage of

this measure is that by combining Goldsmithetal's(l963) estimates for
the early years with more recent estimates by von Furstenberg (1977), it
is possible to put together a long series of comparable ratios.

Again, the replacement value ratios exhibit a broad pattern that is

similar in many respects to that of the book value ratios: corporate debt
usage apparently fell to a low point at the end of World War II and

subsequently rose. However, the replacement value data suggest that the
steadiest increases were over by the inid—l960s, with a more cyclical

pattern ensuing since then. An especially interesting feature of the
replacement value data is their implication that corporate debt usage was

quite high early in the century. By these estimates, the corporate debt
ratio was unusually low at the end of World War II, and it has only recently
attained the levels that were normal in the period 1900—1930.

Considered as a group, all three debt ratio measures suggest that the
end of World War II may be a quite misleading reference point from which

to judge recent corporate financing trends. It seems undeniable that
corporate debt usage has risen in the postwar period, but it is far from
clear that current debt levels are unusually high when viewed fiom a long—
run perspective.

B. Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios are a second type of balance sheet ratio frequently

used to measure financial condition. The ratios of liquid assets to total

assets and to short—term liabilities for U.S. nonfinancial corporations

are shown in Table 1 for selected years. Total assets are measured at

Liquid Assets

1Liquid assets consist of currency, deposits and marketable securities

other than corporate stock. Total assets are measured at replacement

value. Data for 1900—1945 are from Goldsmith et al. (1963) and for
1953—1975 from Goldsmith (1982).
2Short—term liabilities are loans (except mortgages), short—te paper,

profit taxes payable and trade debt. Data for 1900—1945 are from
Goldsmith et al. (1963) and for 1953—1982 from Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, Flow of Funds Accounts.

replacement value, while short—term liabilities are measured at book value.

As worried observers have noted, there indeed appears to have been a
substantial decline in corporate liquidity during the postwar period.

However, as with the debt ratios, 1945 was a year of unusually low financial

risk for corporations. Not only were their debt ratios at historic lows
by the end of the war, but they held large amounts of U.S. government

securities as well. If we subtracted liquid asset holdings from total
debt, we would see that corporations were effectively in a position of
negative leverage at that time.

From a longer—run perspective, recent ratios of liquid assets to

total assets do not seem alarmingly low. Their levels are roughly
commensurate with those of the 1900—1930 period. It does appear, though, that
the most recent ratio of liquid assets to short—term liabilities is somewhat
low, even by historical standards. This suggests that short—term debt has
risen in relative terms at the same time that liquid assets have been

declining. Whether or not this trend is cause for concern will be

C.

Flows of Funds

A different approach to assessing corporations' financial condition

is to examine flows of funds over selected periods. While the balance
sheet measures the cumulative effect of all prior flows as of a particular
moment, the flow data reflect corporations' actual financing decisions
(FIG. 3

during specified periods. In Figure 3, for example, the yearly flows of

sources of funds for U.S. nonfinancial corporations, are graphed for the

period 1946—1983. Data are taken from the Federal Reserve's Flow of
Funds Accounts.

These data do give one indication of financial duress for the

corporate sector in recent years that was not readily apparent in the

balance sheet data: the volatility of funds flow composition has increased
tremendously since the early 1970s. The availability of internal funds
relative to total financing needs has alternately plunged and soared.

Simultaneously, debt usage has reached unusually high levels when internal
funds were short and unusually low levels when internal funds weie plentiful.

Once again it should be noted, though, that one's reference point is

important to any conclusions about volatility, it could possibly be argued
that the period from the late l950s to the late '60s was one of unusual

stability and that recent fluctuations are more akin to those experienced
in the immediate postwar years.

An accurate picture of long—term trends is more likely to emerge if

(TLE 2

HE)

we smooth Out some of these yearly fluctuations. The same funds flow ratios
are thus shown for five—year periods in Table 2. The use of longer periods
also allows the Flow of Funds data to be supplemented by Goldsmith's (1958)

estimates of funds flow composition for selected periods between 1900 and
1945.

Several trends are apparent in Table 2. First, debt has accounted
for a consistently larger fraction of total financing since the inid—1960s

than was the case for nearly all prior periods. Even with recent declines

from the 1969—73 peak, debt financing appears to be quite high. Second,
the rise in debt financing has not been caused by an increase in long—term

debt, which, if anything, may exhibit some downtrend. Rather, it is short—
term liabilities that have increased markedly. Third, the increase in
short—term debt cannot be predominantly attributed to the growth of such
spontaneous liabilities as tax accruals and trade debt. Much of it has come
from credit market instruments, such as bank loans and commercial paper.4
Fourth, stock issues fell precipitously as a source of funds during World

War II and have remained low ever since. Finally, it is difficult to
discern any long—run trend in internal funds.

At least in part, then, any trend toward increased debt—equity
ratios could be characterized as a substitution of short—term debt for

external equity. Such a characterization offers some support for the fears
of those observers who argue that U.S. corporations have dramatically
increased their exposure to financial risk.
However, this interpretation of the data is subject to qualification.

As it does with the balance sheet ratios, inflation may distort the

financing picture reflected in the Flow of Funds data. In particular,
von Furstenberg and Malkiel (1977) have argued that annual funds flows
should be adjusted for any changes in firms' real indebtedness during the
year that are caused by changes in the price level.

Suppose, for example, that the real interest rate is 4 percent, If
expected inflation suddenly increases from zero to 8 percent, lenders will
demand a nominal interest rate of roughly 12 percent in order to provide

themselves a 4 percent real return. If the inflationary process is neutral,
one would expect these nominal adjustments to take place, leaving the real
pattern of corporate profits, investment and financing undisturbed.

—8--

Note, however, that in this example a neutral inflation will increase
corporations' operating cash flows by 8 percent, while their nominal interest

payments rise by 200 percent. As conventionally reported, corporate internal
funds will not rise as fast as the inflation rate. If the flow of debt
financing remains constant in real terms, this necessarily implies that
nominal debt financing will rise relative to nominal internal funds.
The inflation premium in nominal interest payments is more appropriately
treated as a return of the lender's real principal, which just compensates

for the decline in real value of the nominal principal. As a return of
principal, however, this amount should not be deducted from corporate profits

but rather treated as any other net retirement of debt, By this argument,
we should therefore add to reported internal funds any decline in the real
value of outstanding debt, since it is not in the true sense a current

expense. The same amount should also be subtracted from reported debt issues.
Since it represents a retirement of real principal, only new debt issues over
and above this amount represent net increases in real debt.

The data in Table 2 were therefore adjusted for changes in real indebtedness, following the procedure outlined in von Furstenberg and Malkiel

(1977). The revised relative proportions of gross internal funds and total
(TABLE 3
HERE)

debt are shown in Table 3, alongside the corresponding unadjusted figures.
The adjusted figures give the impression that recent debt proportions

are by no means unusually high. Even after adjusting for inflation, however,
the proportions of debt financing in the late 1960s and early l970s were

unusually high and the past eight years have witnessed a substantial

correction. Much of this correction has occurred through heavy reliance on
adjusted internal sources. Instead of financing funds needs with increasing

porations for 1949—83 (source: Economic Report of the President). Data on total

and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Flow of Funds Accounts.

or even constant proportions of real debt, corporations have in effect been
retiring some of their maturing real debt principal, with internal funds.

D. Dividend Payout Ratios
The assertion that corporations have placed heavy emphasis on internal
funds in recent years naturally raises the question of whether they have
sacrificed dividend payments in order to do so. Three measures of corporate
(TABLE 4
HERE)

dividend payout over selected periods are presented in Table 4.

The ratios in columns 1 and 2 measure dividend payments relative to
total. available internal funds. Both the adjusted and unadjusted internal

funds measures from Table 3 have been used in computing these ratios. The
data suggest that corporations did indeed cut their dividend payout somewhat, even before the peak in debt issuance, in an attempt to increase the
share of equity financing.

The more traditional measure of payout, dividends divided by net profit

after taxes, is shown in Column 3. These figures also convey the impression
that dividends were cut fairly severely in order to conserve internal funds,

beginning as early as the midl96Os. Some of the decline in payout in the
mid—1960s may be attributable to the well—known tendency of dividends to

lag behind profits. However, subsequent periods were not particuarly
profitable ones for U.S. corporations, so this does not explain away the

long period of relatively low payouts from 1964 to the present. The decline
in payout during the 1974—78 period is particularly dramatic.

E. Summary of Financing Trends
Does the weight of the evidence support the view that U.S. corporations

have become increasingly prone to financial weakness? In most respects, I

believe the most plausible answer is no. Many assertions of corporate
balance sheet deterioration use the end of World War II as their reference

point, but as we have seen, that was hardly a typical time. Viewed from
a longer—run perspective, current corporate debt usage does not appear

dangerously high nor does liquidity appear dangerously low.5 In addition,
adjustment for inflationary distortions over the past fifteen years removes
some of the trend toward increased debt that appears in the raw data. Finally,
it should be recognized that corporations have made substantial efforts
over the past eight years, particularly through reduced dividend payout,
to rebuild financial strength.

Nevertheless, some opposing points must be conceded. The financial
environment of the past ten to fifteen years has been more volatile, as is
reflected in the sharp changes in the composition of funds sources.
Corporate treasurers have had to act more nimbly and imaginatively in order

to keep up with the fluctuations in external funds needs. Increased use
of short—term and floating rate debt has undeniably made corporations more

vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations. And even if some of corporate
borrowing in recent years is a rolling over of real principal instead of
net new debt, it is still true that these roliovers necessitate more
frequent visits to the capital market.

II. What Causes the Trends in Corporate Financing?
Regardless of our perception of financial strength or weakness, we
could feel more comfortable with our understanding of these corporate

financing developments if we knew their primary determinants. This in
turn necessitates a theory of corporate capital structure.

It is widely believed that corporations adjust their financing to

some target balance sheet composition. As Myers (1984) has argued,

—11—

the adjustment process may be quite slow, and thus there may be a good

deal of slippage between actual and target balance sheets. For example,
subject to their established dividend policies, firms may have a decided

preference for internal over external funds, and, to the extent that ex-

ternal funds are needed, for debt over stock issues. Thus when internal
funds are plentiful relative to investment needs, debt ratios will fall

below target, while the reverse will occur when internal funds are in
short supply.

Despite this slippage, the influence of the target financing compo-

sition will be felt over the long run. Corporations do reach points
where they feel their debt capacity is exhausted and they must turn to

external equity. Moreover, the standards for debt capacity and the
willingness to issue equity appear to change over time. From Table 2,
the reluctance to issue equity was apparently much less in the 1900—1940
period than it has been in recent decades.

The primary determinants of these changing standards that have been
emphasized by business financing observers are perceptions of business

risk, the level of corporate and personal taxes and inflation. In the
paragraphs that follow we will explore the extent to which changes in

these underlying factors correspond to business financing patterns. The
possible influence of federal government borrowing on business financing
will also be considered.

A. Business Risk
Since the threat of bankruptcy entails both explicit and implicit

costs, firms will limit their debt ratios in order to avoid it. For any
given debt level, the threat of bankruptcy is greater as the degree of

—12—

business risk increases. Thus we would expect an inverse relationship
between corporate debt ratios and perceived business risk.

Unfortunately, perceived business risk Is notoriously difficult to

measure. A possible proxy for investors' risk perceptions in a given year
is the standard deviation of monthly percentage stock price changes for

that year. Estimates of these standard deviations, derived from Standard
(FIG. 4
HERE)

and Poor's Composite Index for the years 1900— 1980 are shown in Figure 4,
plotted against the pattern of replacement value debt ratios.

Movements in stock price volatility are dominated by the tremendous

fluctuations of the Depression era. Figure 4 thus offers some support
for the argument made by many observers: Corporate debt ratios plunged
in the wake of the huge increases in business risk during the Great
Depression and then began a long and steady climb, as business risk consistently remained at lower levels in the postwar years.

However, the ability of this proxy for business risk to explain

the shorter swings in corporate debt ratios is not very great. One might
argue that the increased volatility around 1980 is associated with the
reductions in debt financing that are apparent in the Flow of Funds data in

Tables 2 and 36 But the sharp changes in the debt ratio between 1900 and
1922 do not correspond to changes in volatility, and it is similarly difficult to match up most financing swings since 1960 with stock price

fluctuations. Overall, the evidence that perceived business risk continually and consistently affects corporate financing patterns is limited.

B. Corporate and Personal Taxes
It is commonly held that the tax deductibility of interest favors

debt over equity financing. From an investor's standpoint, however,
interest is taxable at ordinary income rates, whereas a substantial

fraction of the returns to equity are taxed at lower capital gains

rates. The degree to which the tax advantage of debt at the corporate
level outweighs its disadvantage at the investor level thus depends on
the relative magnitudes of corporate and personal tax rates.
There is, of course, a whole spectrum of personal tax rates, and what

is really needed is some idea of the distribution of investor wealth

across tax brackets. Inthe absence of such information, a cruder
measure, which I label the "debt incentive tax ratio" has been constructed as a proxy for the net tax advantage of corporate debt. It is

essentially a comparison between statutory corporate tax rates and the

lowest level of statutory personal rates.] This debt incentive tax ratio
(FIG. 5
HERE)

has been graphed in Figure 5 against the replacement value debt ratio.
Figure 5 indicates that the biggest increase in the net tax advantage to corporate debt occurred between the late 1930s and early l950s.

The fact that this tax advantage has remained at a relatively high level for
the past forty years is undoubtedly related to the postwar increases in

corporate debt. This tax advantage has been nearly constant for some time,
though, so it cannot explain short—run fluctuations in the debt—equity mix.

It is also something of a puzzle that debt financing proportions were high
early in the century when there was no tax advantage and then fell after
the tax code was introduced.

While there is little evidence of a close correspondence between
movements in tax rates and corporate debt ratios, it is possible that some of
the effect of tax considerations has been felt in more subtle ways. One

could argue on the basis of Table 4 that corporations have cut their dividend
payouts somewhat in the wake of personal tax increases occurring in the l940s

and have thus substituted internal for external equity. In addition,
tax considerations have clearly influenced the design of securities,

apart from their relative proportions. This can be seen through such
recent innovations as original—issue discount bonds, adjustable rate
preferred stock and the short—lived adjustable rate convertible note.

C. Inflation
Inflation is a third factor that is often thought to affect corporate

financing proportions. One argument is that inflation enables corporations
to repay their debt with cheaper dollars, but it is hard to understand why
investors would not try to protect themselves through higher interest rates.
A more sophisticated argument revolves around the fact that as it causes
interest rates to rise, inflation increases the effective real tax deductions

associated with debt. The inflation premium in interest rates is, of course,
also taxable to investors, but as long as the corporate tax rate exceeds
the personal rate of the marginal bondholder, inflation may cause the net
tax advantage of corporate debt to increase.

In Figure 6, annual inflation rates, as measured by percentage changes

(FIG. 6
HERE)

in

the GNP deflator, are graphed against replacement value debt ratios.

Although debt ratios have been relatively high in the inflationary years
of the 1970s, it would be difficult to argue on the basis of Figure 6
that there has been a close positive relationship between the movements in
inflation rates and debt ratios.

Again, as with tax considerations, some of inflation's effects may

manifest themselves in more subtle ways. To see one such effect, consider
the role of corporations in the financial system: Corporations perform an
intermediary role, purchasing and managing productive assets and, in effect,

repackaging these assets for investors in the form of debt and equity claims.

Purely financial intermediaries may perform further repackaging.
Through term lending, for example, commercial banks transform long—
term business debt into shorter—term deposits,

Now consider the effects of high and variable inflation rates on

investors' demand for securities. If investors prefer short—term, or
at least variable rate securities in such an environment, and if commercial

banks no longer find maturity intermediation a viable activity, nonfinancial

corporations will have to perform this function themselves. That is, they
will repackage more of their assets in the form of short—term and floating

rate debt instruments. Thus inflation, and in particular uncertain inflation, may affect not so much the debt—equity mix, but rather the kinds of
debt instruments corporations must issue to satisfy the needs of investors.

D. Federal Government Borrowin
Corporate financing behavior should also be influenced by the behavior of other sectors in the financial system. For example, the supply
of federal government debt will condition investors' willingness to absorb

the relatively low—risk fixed claims represented by corporate debt. While
not often cited as a determinant of the corporate financing mix, government

borrowing may thus exert an important influence on the financing activities
of the corporate sector as a whole.8
(FIG. 7
HERE)

Evidence in support of such a relationship is presented in Figure 7,

in which the ratio of federal government debt to that of all domestic nonfinancial sectors is graphed against the replacement value debt ratio for

corporations. There appears to be a strong inverse relationship between the
two series. In the early part of the century, when government debt was
small, corporations satisfied investors' demands for safe, fixed claims

by issuing large proportions of their own

debt.

Then, as federal borrow—

ing swelled during the Depression years and World War II, corporate debt
proportions fell drastically.

The inverse relationship is even more striking if we recall from
Table 4 that corporations held large proportions of government securities in

1945. Not only was the amount of government debt curtailing corporate
debt proportions, but, in effect, corporations were repackaging some portion
of that government debt in the form of corporate equity.

Following World War II, the trend in the share of government debt has
been primarily downward, while corporate debt ratios have simultaneously

drifted upward. Moreover, many of the short—term swings in government debt
share have been mirrored by opposite movements in corporate debt proportions.
When the evidence on determinants of corporate financing patterns is
viewed as a whole, the influence of the federal government stands out

sharply. Although their short—run impacts are more difficult to discern,
it has been argued that perceived business risk, the tax system and inflation
all appear to exert a broad influence on the financing of the corporate sector.
All three factors are in turn heavily influenced by federal government

activities. In addition, government regulations affect financial institutions' ability to diversify their Portfolios, pay market interest rates, offer
new customer services and hence to fully perform their intermediation function.
Indirectly, then, such regulations influence the extent to which corporations

must perform this function themselves. Finally, as indicated by Figure 7,
the government's borrowing affects corporate financing behavior by altering
relative supplies of securities in the capital markets and hence their rel-

ative prices. Apart from the ebb and flow of investment opportunities and
internal funds, therefore, the activities of the federal government may be

—17—

the major underlying determinant of corporate financing patterns.

III. Conclusion
Overall, the analysis of this paper suggests that the financial
condition of U.S. corporations is subject to a number of powerful

corrective mechanisms. These mechanisms are unlikely to allow the
business sector by itself to be the leader of an unchecked slide
toward financial disaster.

First, there is some evidence that a rise in perceived business

risk causes firms to moderate their reliance on debt financing. This
tendency is hard to observe during short—run business cycle swings,
but as business risk changes over prolonged periods it is more notice-

able. It is certainly evident in the sharp cutback in debt proportions

in the wake of the Great Depression, for example. It also seems likely
that some of the moderation in debt financing in recent years has been
motivated by perceptions of increased business risk.
Second, long—run balance sheet targets send strong danger signals

when financing proportions get too far out of line. This is particularly apparent in the Flow of Funds data in Tables 2 and 3, as debt
financing was curtailed after reaching historically high levels during
1969—73.

Moreover, it does not appear that these traditional balance sheet

targets have been adjusted for inflationary distortions. The data in
Table 3 suggest that, once corrections are made for changes in real
indebtedness, corporate financial policies were quite conservative in

recent years. This may stand as testimony to the difficulty of convincing lenders that traditional balance sheet ratios do not have the

—18—

same meaning in inflationary periods. Indeed, U.S. corporations
have severely curtailed dividend payments and have placed heavy reliance on internal funds since the mid l970s in an effort to reduce
their dependence on external suppliers of funds.
Finally, the behavior of other sectors in the capital market,

particularly the federal government, can act as an important check

on corporate borrowing. Any one corporation is probably small
enough that it need not worry about the effects of its own securities

issues on the relative supplies of different types of instruments. The
corporate sector as a whole, by contrast, must compete with the other

sectors who are primarily issuers of debt. As the federal government
in particular increases its borrowing, investors' appetite for cor-

porate debt will be less strong and corporations may turn toward other
financing sources, especially internal equity.

While these forces act as checks against excessive risk—taking, it
should not be inferred that U.S. corporations face no financial problems

whatsoever. In the presence of inflation and volatile interest rates,
corporations have increasingly had to take on some of the intermediation

functions that traditional financial institutions have no longer been
able or willing to perform. This has led them to rely more heavily on
short—term liabilities and has necessitated more frequent rolling over
of their outstanding debt.

The outlook for inflation and economic stability, then, is one of

the keys to future corporate financing patterns. These forces will
determine whether corporations face the same sharp swings in internal
funds availability that they experienced in the 1970s and early l980s.

They will also influence the allocation of financial intermediation
activity between corporations and financial institutions.

—19—

A second major problem that business corporations face is the

future course of government financing. To the extent that potential
corporate borrowing is crowded out by the federal government, the

corporate sector faces some potentially painfulchoices: it must cut
dividends in order to increase internal funds, it must raise external
equity, or it must cut back on capital spending.
In part, uncertainties about future corporate financing patterns

reflect uncertainty over the future course of inflation, economic

stability and government borrowing. It should also be clear, however,
that a good part of any residual uncertainty stems from the fact that

we still have much to learn about these patterns. The effects of
business risk, taxes and inflation leave traces in the data, but these

forces do not appear to be the whole story. Moreover, their effects
are more subtle and more difficult to uncover than has commonly been
thought.

At least two remaining issues require a better understanding. One
of these is the behavior of equity issues. Why, for example, were
corporations so much more willing to issue equity earlier in the

century than they have been in the postwar years? Is this entirely a
tax—related phenomenon or are other forces at work? A second important
issue is the precise nature of the linkage between the borrowing activity
of the federal government and the financing, dividend and investment
policy of the corporate sector.

1. This feeling is especially prevalent among members of the business
press (see Bennett 1984; Business Week 1974, 1982; and Carson—Parker
1981) and analysts of the financial system (see Kaufman 1981, Mains
1980, Nassaro 1977 and Moran 1984). Government officials have also
expressed concern over corporate financing trends, particularly in the
wake of the leveraged buyout boom (e.g. Shad 1984).

2. Perceived trends, of course, are always dependent on the observer's
reference point. Miller (1963) examined the same data from 1926
through the mid—1950s and concluded, quite reasonably, that there had
been no trend in corporate debt ratios over this period.

3. Gordon and Malkiel (1981) present evidence for the pefiod 1973—78
suggesting that inclusion of lease and pension obligations would increase reported debt ratios by approximately one—third.

4. Some portion of bank loans should in fact be classified as long—
term, but the actual fraction is impossible to estimate with any

degree of confidence. There is no evidence of any trend toward increasingly long—term bank loans from, say, the mid—l960s onward. Moreover, the predominance of floating rate loans in recent years implies
that even bank term loans have many of the characteristics of short—
term debt.

5. See also Mitchell (1983) for an elaboration of the argument that,
even if liquidity ratios have declined, the growth of bank loan
commitments and the commercial paper market have increased cor—
porations' ability to raise funds on short notice.

6. Other measures indicate an increase in business risk around this time
as well. Wood (1981), for example, shows that the volatility of real
interest rates increased sharply after 1972. Bodie, Kane and McDonald
(1984) show that the real risk premium on long—term bonds suddenly jumped
in 1979.

t)/(l t), where

t is the corporate tax rate and t is the lowest personal rate. In
