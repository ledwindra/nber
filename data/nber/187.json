This problem is analyzed within the framework of a model of intertemporal utility maximization. The organization of this work is as follows. Section 1 introduces the topic. Section 2 presents the model of individual optimization and of the market equilibrium. Sections 3 through 5 present the comparative statistics analysis. Section 3 evaluates the effects on the equilibrium retirement age, section 4 modifies the benefits formula to depend on retirement age and section 5 examines the wealth-income ratio effect. Section 6 introduces the intergenerational transfer problem. Section 7 presents the general model underlying the previous sections.\n\n",
