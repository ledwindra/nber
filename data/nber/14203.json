    "abstract": "\n\nThe wage differential between Francophone and Anglophone men from 1970 to 2000 fell by 25 percentage points within Quebec, but only by 10 points Canada-wide, largely because the wages of Quebec Anglophones fell by 15 points relative to other Canadian Anglophones. Accordingly, the Canadian measure of the Francophone wage gap better reflects the changing welfare of Francophones than the Quebec measure. Over half of   the reduction in the Canadian Francophone wage gap is explained by rising Francophone education levels.  In Quebec, the declining number and relative wages of Anglophone workers is best explained by a falling demand for English-speaking labour.\n\n",
