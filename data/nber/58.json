    "abstract": "\n\nWe give some Monte Carlo results on the performance of two robust alternatives to least squares regression estimation - least absolute residuals and the one-step \"sine\" estimator. We show how to scale the residuals for the sine estimator to achieve constant efficiency at the Gaussian across various choices of X-matrix and give some results for the contaminated Gaussian distribution.\n\n",
