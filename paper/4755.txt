CHANGING WAGE STRUCFURE AND
BLACK-WHITE WAGE DIFFERENTIALS
AMONG MEN AND WOMEN:
A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS
ABSTRACT'
Despite several decades of research there is still widespread disagreement over the

interpretation of the wage differences between black and white workers. Do the differences

reflect productivity differences, discrimination, or both? If lower black earnings reflect a
productivity difference, then an economy-wide increase in the relative wages of more highlyskilled workers should lead to a parallel increase in the black-white earnings gap. We evaluate

this hypothesis using longitudinal data for men and women from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics.
Our findings suggest that returns to observed and unobserved skills of male workers mse

by 5-10 percent between 1979 and 1985. For female workers, the return to observed skills was
relatively constant while the return to unobserved skills increased by 15 percent,. The evidence
that black-white wage differentials rise with the return to skill is mixed. Among female workers

the black-white wage gap widened in the early 1 980s -- consistent with the premise that racial
wage differences reflect a productivity difference. For men in our sample the black-white wage
gap declined between 1979 and 1985 — a change that is inconsistent with the rise in the return

for skills.

How do black-white wage differentials respond to a change in the
relative earnings of skilled workers? The answer depends on the underlying
sources of the observed racial wage gap. If lower earnings of black workers
reflect a difference in productivity, then an economy-wide increaáe in the wage

premium for skilled workers should lead to a proportional expansion in
measured black-white wage differences (Chinhui Juhn, Kevin M. Murphy, and

Brooks Pierce (1991), James P. Smith (1993)). If lower black wages reflect
discrimination, however, then there is no obvious reason why a change in the
structure of wages should affect the black-white wage differential.

The answer also depends on the nature of the changes in the overall
wage structure. Labor market earnings vary across individuals with different

levels of age and education, and among workers with the same observed
characteristics. Unless wage differentials expand or contract proportionally, it
is unclear how a given shift in the wage structure should affect black workers
relative to whites. Are the assumed productivity differences between black and

white workers valued in the labor market at the same rate as productivity

differences by age and education, or are they evaluated like productivity
differences among workers with the same observed characteristics?
In this paper we use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics to measure relative changes in the earnings differentials associated
with various dimensions of skill, and compare these changes to the changes in

the measured black-white wage gaps for men and women. Longitudinal data
enable us to identi& changes in the returns to both observed and unobserved
person-specific wage determinants. Longitudinal data also allow us to measure

changes in the black-white wage differential for a fixed cohort of workers -thereby abstracting from relative changes in background characteristics that could

bias an inter-cohort comparison. We contrast the observed changes in the black-

white wage gap for then and women against the predictions generated by

2

assuming that racial wage gaps vary proportionally with the returns to observed
and/or unobserved skill.

For men, our results suggest that the labor market returns to observed
and unobserved skill rose roughly proportionally between 1979 and 1985. Over
this period, however, the black-white wage differential for male household heath

in the P30 sample was relatively constant, casting some doubt on the
hypothesis that the size of the racial wage gap is linked to the return to skill.
For women, on the other hand, the returns to observed wage determinants were

relatively constant while the returns to person-specific unobserved wage
determinants rose significantly. The black-white wage differential for female
household heads/wives in the PSID sample also increased in the early 1980s.
Our findings for women are therefore consistent with a link between the black-

white wage gap and the return to person-specific unobserved skill.

I. Changes in the Wage Structure in the Early 1980s
Figure 1 graphs two indexes of overall wage inequality for men and
women derived from Current Population Survey (CPS) data from 1973 to 1992.'

The inequality measures are the standard deviation of log hourly wages and the

differential between the 90th and 10th percentiles of log wages (the "90-10
gap"). As has been noted in several recent papers (see Frank Levy and Richard

tThe data are drawn from the May CPS files for 1973-78, and merged files
combining one-quarter of all individuals in every monthly CPS from 1979 to
1992. The wage data are constructed from reported hourly or weekly earnings
for each respondent's main job. See John DiNardo, Nicole Fortin, and Thomas
Lemieux (1993) formore details. Note that these data showsomewhat different
trends than wage inequality measures derived from annual earnings for full-time
full-year workers in the March CPS, as reported in Murphy and Welch (1993).
The latter show fairly steady increases in inequality throughout the 1 970s and
l980s.

3

Murnane (1992) for a survey) earnings inequality expanded in the early 1980s
after a period of stability in the 1 lOs. Relative to 1973, the standard deviation

of men's wages grew by 10 percent over the 1980s, with most of the growth
concentrated between 1980 and 1985. The proportional increase in the 90-10

gap was larger but shows a similar concentration in the 1980-85 period. The

trend in wage inequality for women is roughly parallel to the trend for men
between 1973 and 1985, but shows a continuing increase through the later half
of the 1980s.

The data in Figure 1 suggest that the structure of wages changed
dramatically in the early 1 980s. In order to analyze the nature of these changes

and explore their implications for black-white wage differences, we created
longitudinal samples of wage information using 1979-85 data from the Panel

Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).2 We used the 1985 merged familyindividual file of the PSID to construct a sample of men who were household

heads in every year from 1979 to 1985, and a parallel sample of women who

were either household heads or wives of household heads in every year from
1979 to 1985. We excluded from our samples individuals who were over 64 in
1985, as well as individuals whose "potential experience" (age-education-6) was

lessthan 0 in l979.
Characteristics of our PSID samples, together with comparative
information for individuals in the 1979 and 1985 CPS merged monthly earnings

files, are presented in Table 1. The column labelled "PSID - Afl" contains

2Although it would be interesting to construct a longer panel (spanning the
1979-89 period, for example), the requirement of each additional year of data
leads to reduction in the available sample size.
3We also excluded a small number of individuals with missing age, race or

education data.

4

information on the entire sample of men or women that satisf' our age and
household-head requirements. The column labelled "P30 - Continuous Wages"
contains information on the subset of individuals (803 women, 1122 men) who

report a valid hourly wage for their main job in each year from 1979 to l985.

The "CPS" columns present information for men or women age 16-64 (with
positive potential experience) who report a valid hourly or weekly wage on their

main job in the 1979 and 1985 CPS surveys.5

The (weighted) average characteristics of our P30 samples are fairly
similar to the average characteristics of workers in the CPS, although the P311)

samples are slightly older and better-educated.6 Hourly wages in 1979 are also

slightly higher in the P30 samples. Between 1979 and 1985 the CPS samples
show a small real wage gain for women and a real wage decline for men. The
P311) samples, on the other hand, show significant real wage growth for both
groups.

This difference reflects the fact that the CPS samples have an

(approximately) constant age structure, whereas the PSID samples age by 6 years

over our sample period. In light of recent studies of the changing male-female

wage gap (e.g. Francine Blau and Andrea Bdller (1992)), it is interesting to
compare the relative changes in male and female wages in the CPS and P30

he P30 questionnaire asks about earnings over the relevant pay period
(depending on how the respondent is paid) for the main job held at the time of
the survey. The answer is then converted to an hourly rate by the P30 survey
administrators assuming a fixed schedule of hours per week.

5Neither the P3rD nor the CPS collect wage information from the selfemployed. Self-employed workers are therefore excluded from the CPS samples
underlying Table 1, and from the P311) sample with continuous wages.
6The

age measures for the PSID sample are for 1979. The education

measures are taken from the 1985 P50 questionnaire. We use the 1985 family
weights as weights in all our statistical procedures.

samples.

Between 1979 and 1985 the PSID samples actually show faster

convergence in female relative wages than the CPS sample. This comparison
suggests that the narrowing of the male-female wage gap over the 1980s was
driven by relative female wage growth within cohorts, rather than by changing
cohort composition.

Table I also reports the dispersion in wages and the average blackwhite wage gap in 1979 and 1985. In the CPS, the standard deviation of log

wages for women rose by 0.074 (18 percent) from 1979 to 1985. Using the
PSID sample as a cross-section (e.g., using all available wage observations in a

given year to compute the standard deviation of wages in that year) the rise in

female wage inequality is comparable. Among the subsample of women with
continuous wage data, however, the rise in wage inequality is smaller. A similar

pattern emerges for men. The rise in wage inequality for men in the PSID
sample with continuous wage data is particularly small, although this is partly

a reflection of the relatively high dispersion in wages for this sample in 1979

relative to 1980 or 1981. Measured from 1981 to 1985, the growth in wage
dispersion for men with continuous wage data was 0.027 (7 percent).
Just as the trends in wage dispersion are somewhat different in the CPS
and PSID samples, the trends in the black-white wage gap also vary between the

samples. CPS data indicate a slight widening of the black-white wage gap for

women between 1979 and 1985, and a more significant (4 percentage point)
widening of the gap for men.7 The P80 data show a similar trend in the black-

white wage gap for women, but a slight narrowing of the wage gap for men.

7See John Bound and Richard Freeman (1992) and Smith (1993) for
analyses of recent changes in the black-white wage gap for men, and Blau and
Beller (1992) and David Card and Lemieux (1993) for an analysis of black-white
wage differentials for men and women during the l970s and the l980s.

IL Estimates of the Changing Wage Structure
In this section we describe the econometric models we use to measure

the changes in the structure of wages observed in our PSID samples between
1979 and 1985. We begin with an equation that describes the logarithm of the

hourly wage for individual i in period t (w1t) as a function of observed
characteristics (xt), a race indicator CD1), a set of time-varying coefficients, and

a person- and time-specific residual (e):
w1 =

(1)

b + D1; + xj3+ ;•

In this equation cc represents the black-white wage differential in period t and
J3 represents a vector of returns to the characteristics included in x11 Suppose

that the rates of return to the various dimensions of observed skill vary
proportionally over time. Then 13='D, where $3 is a time-invariant vector
that transforms observed characteristics into a single index of skill, and
represents a relative "price" of observed skill in period t (with öl in 1979).

The assumption that returns to education, experience, and other observed
characteristics vary proportionally over time is highly restrictive, but provides
a useful benchmark for summarizing changes in the return to observed skills.8
For comparison with the relative price of observed skill we can express
the black-white wage differential in period t as a proportion of its value in 1979:

;=1ci, with $79=l. Adopting this normalization and imposing the single index
assumption for observed skills, equation (1) can be rewritten as:

(2) w1 = b + $t(01cc) + &t(xi'Ii) + €j.

8The

assumption that x can be aggregated to a single index of skill is
necessary to define a unique "price" for observed skill in any period. We
include in x1 a linear education term, a quartic function of potential experience,
and an interaction of experience and education.

7

If the wage differential between black and white workers is due to productivity

differences valued at the same rate as observed skills, then 'P =

for all t.

This is a readily-tested nonlinear restriction on the set of equations represented

by(2).
Not all the systematic productivity differences across individuals are
readily captured by the observed characteristics in xk. Presumably, some portion

of the residual €11 represents a return to person-specific unobserved skills.
Unless the rate of return to unobserved skills varies directly with the rate of
return to observed skills, however, it is unclear which rate of return should be
compared to the wage differential between blacks and whites. Our approach is
to estimate the rates of return to observed and unobserved skills separately, and

then compare changes in these rates of return to each other and to the changes
in the observed black-white wage differential.
Estimation of the rate of return to unobserved person-specific skills is

complicated by the fact that the error term Et is likely to contain both
productivity components and reporting errors and/or random discrepancies

between wages and productivity. In general it is impossible to separately
identi& the true productivity components of residual wage variation from
random measurement errors. We make the identiing assumption that the nonproductivity components of e are independently and identically distributed over

time. We further assume that the productivity component of ;
decomposed as

can be

where p is a stationary AR(l) process centered around a

person specific mean a1:

pa+ui,
where uk = pu11 + e1.
In direct analogy with our treatment of the return to observed skills, 'Vt has the

interpretation of the relative return to unobserved skill in period t. (We

S

normalize W79—l).

Letting

denote the measurement error in wages, Eu can be written

as:

=

(3)

w(a + u1) + v.

If the rate of return to unobserved skill is constant, equation (3) implies that the

person-specific wage residual is covariance-stationary with a declining
autocorrelation function.9 More generally, if the rate of return to unobserved

skill varies over time, our assumptions imply a restrictive pattern in the
covariance structure of the individual wage residuals.

Equations (2) and (3) yield an non-linear error-components model for log

wages that is readily estimable by minimum distance methods. Specifically,

these equations imply the following expressions for the first and second
moments of wages, conditional on the vector of observed characteristics D,x1
(where x1=(x1i,...x1)):

respectively. Restrictions on the vector of parameters 0 can be tested using the
procedure developed by Ronald Gallant and Dale Jorgenson (1979).

One shortcoming of our econometric model is that it requires
continuous wage data from 1979 to 1985. This is a serious limitation: only 63
percent of men and 21 percent of women in our P80 sample report wages every

year (see Table 1). By requiring continuous wage data we are likely to exclude

individuals who were subject to a substantial labor market shock at some time

in the early 1980s and were unemployed at one of the interview dates. Our

sample restrictions presumably lead us to understate the effect ,f structural
shocks on the structure of wages. In principle we could either use a two-step

selection correction to adjust the first and second moment equations for the

sample selection requirement, or generalize our econometric procedure to
incorporate unbalanced data in the estimation. We leave these extensions for
fUture research.

IlL Estimation Results
Tables 2a and 2b report the estimation results for our models of the
wage structure applied to women and men in the PSID. Two specifications are
presented in each table: an unconstrained model in which the vectors of returns
to observed and unobserved skills, and the relative black-white wage differential

are estimated freely; and a highly restrictive "one-factor" model in which the
returns to observable and unobservable skill and the relative black-white wage

differential are all constrained to be proportional (i.e., 6 vr4¼ for all t).
Although not reported in the tables, we have also estimated a variety of other

models, including a stationary model with S=y=4=l, and a model with a
constant black-white relative wage gap (4=l). Goodness-of-fit tests for these
alternative specifications are reported in Table 3.
Looking first at the results for women, the estimated rates of return to

observed and unobserved skills show a very different pattern over the 1 980s.
Whereas the estimated returns to observed skill (column 1 of Table 2a) follow

a u-shaped' trajectory, the estimated returns to unobserved skills (column 2 of
Table 2a) increase steadily. A test that the returns to observed and unobserved
skill are equal (row 6 of Table 3) is soundly rejected. The relative black-white
wage differentials (colunm 3 of Table 2a) are rather imprecisely estimated but

show a sizeable increase from 1979 to 1985. Consequently, a test that the
black-white wage differences for women are proportional to the relative return

to unobserved skill is well below its critical value (row 4 of Table 3) whereas
a test that the black-white differences are proportional to the return to observed
skill is significant at the 10 percent level (row 3 of Table 3). It should be noted,

however, that a test for constancy of the black-white relative wage gap over the

1979-85 period is not rejected at conventional significance levels (p-value of
0.18 -- see row 2 of Table 3).
The estimated parameters of the residual wage process (equation (3))

11

are presented in the lower panels of Tables 2a and 2b, together with goodness-

of-fit tests for the unrestricted and restricted models. The estimates of the
productivity process are close to a random-walk model, with an estimated
autoregressive parameter just below 1 and an estimate of aa2 that is arbitrarily

close to 0. The relative magnitudes of the estimated variance components
suggest that about 10 percent of residual wage variation is attributable to random

measurement error, with the remainder attributable to a slowly decaying
productivity process.

The goodness-of-fit statistics in Table 2 are substantially above their
critical values, suggesting that our models for the first and second moments of

female wages are too restrictive. Part of the reason for this lack of fit is a

failure of the single-index restriction

for the observable wage

detenninants.'° Part is also attributable to the overly restrictive model of the
wage residuals implied by the combination of i.i.d. measurement error and a
stationary AR(l) productivity process." In principle we could easily generalize
our models by relaxing the single index restriction for observable skills, and by
introducing a multi-dimensional vector of unobserved skills (see Murphy, Mark

Plant, and Finis Welch (1988)). Given the relatively small sample sizes
available from the PSID, however, we defer these extensions to future work.

10This parallels the findings in our earlier work (Card and Leinieux (1993)).
The difficulty for the single index restriction arises from a relative flatteningof

the experience profile of more-educated relative to less-educated workers over
the 1 980s. If we exclude the interaction of experience and education from our
specification of the xk vector the goodness-of-fit improves significantly.

'tWe fit a model with no restrictions on the observable determinants of
wages (i.e.,
unrestricted) and still obtained a goodness-of-fit statistic
considerably in excess of its critical value.

12

The estimation results for males differ from the results for females in

several important respects.

First, contrary to the results for women, the

estimated rates of return to observed and unobserved skill are relatively similar

for men. A test of equality of the rates of return to observed and unobserved
skills (rpw 6 of Table 3) is far below its critical value. Second, the estimated
black-white wage differentials (column 3 of Table 2b) are extremely variable and

seem to bear no strong relation to the returns to either observed or unobserved

skill. Indeed, the "best fitting" model for the black-white wage gap is one that

imposes a constant differential (1) Despite these differences, the estimated
parameters of the residual wage process are fairly similar for men and women.

Again, about 10 percent of residual wage variation is attributable to random
measurement error, with the remainder attributable to a very slowly decaying
productivity process.

To summarize these results we present in Figure 2 the actual series of
relative black-white wage gaps for men and women in our PSID samples, and
the implied gaps under two alternative assumptions: that the black-white wage

gap is proportional to the relative return to observed skill (4r8); and that the

gap is proportional to the relative return to unobserved skill (t41) For
women, the assumption of proportionality between the return to unobserved skill
and the black-white wage differential is potentially consistent with the data: both

series show a rapid expansion between 1979 and 1985. For men, on the other
hand, the returns to observed and unobserved skills increase proportionally over
the 1980s, and neither series reproduces the pattern of the estimated black-white
wage gap.

VI. Conclusions
We have proposed a relatively simple econometric methodology, based

on the use of individual panel data, to estimate relative changes in the labor
market returns to alternative dimensions of skill. Although the methodology is

13

readily generalizable, we adopt a vet)' restrictive two-dimensional model that

distinguishes between a one-dimensional index of observed skill and another
one-dimensional index of unobserved skill. We compare the estimated rates of
return to these two components of wages over the early 1 980s to the changes in
the black-white wage differential over the same period. This comparison allows

us to

the implicit assumption in several recent papers that the black-white

wage differential is proportional to the "return to skill".

Our empirical results suggest that the returns to observed and
unobserved skills for male workers increased by about 5-10 percent between
1979 and 1985. For female workers, the return to observed skills was relatively

stable while the return to unobserved skill increased by 15 percent. The
evidence that changes in the black-white wage differential are linked to changes

in the return to skill is mixed. On the one hand, the black-white wage gap
among female workers in our PSID sample widened in the early 1 980s -consistent

with the hypothesis that the wage gap between black and white

women reflects a productivity differenoe valued in the labor market at the same
rate as unobserved skills. On the other hand, the black-white wage gap for male
workers in our PSIIJ) sample declined between 1979 and 1985 -- a change that

is inconsistent with the rise in return for skills.

non-allocated hourly or weekly wages, between the ages of 16
and 64, with non—negative potential experience. Sample sizes
in 1979 and 1985 are 62,168 and 71,151, respectively. P510
sample is drawn from the 1985 merged family—individual P510
file and consists of 3834 women age 16—57 in 1979 who were
either heads of households or wives of the heads of households
in every year from 1979 to 1985. The P510 sample with
continuous wages consists of 803 women who report a valid wage
for their main job in each of the 1979—85 interviews.
Both the CPS and PSID wage, data exclude observations with real

hourly wages less than $1.25 per hour in 1979 dollars. Wages
are deflated using the personal consumption deflator to 1979$.

Notes: CPS samples include only paid non—self—employed workers with
non—allocated hourly or weekly wages, between the ages of 16
and 64, with non—negative potential experience. Sample sizes
in 1979 and 1985 are 76,345 and 78,892, respectively.
PSID sample is drawn from the 1985 merged family—individual
PSID file and consists of 3067 men age 16—57 in 1979 who were
heads of household from 1979 to 1985. The PSID sample with
continuous wages consists of 1122 men who report a valid wage
for their main job in each of the 197 9—85 interviews.
Both the CPS and PSID wage data exclude observations with real
hourly wages less than $1.25 per hour in 1979 dollars. Wages
are deflated using the personal consumption deflator to 1979$.
