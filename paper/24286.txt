International Capital Flow Pressures

NBER Working Paper No. 24286
February 2018, Revised October 2019
JEL No. F32,G11,G20
ABSTRACT
Pressures on currencies manifest in exchange rate adjustments and international capital flows, and
can also be offset by policy responses. This paper presents a theory-based measure of capital flow
pressures, a new Exchange Market Pressure index, which combines pressures observed in
exchange rate adjustments, official foreign exchange intervention and monetary policy changes.
We use the index to identify so called safe-haven and risk-on status currencies and investigate the
drivers of this status, showing the importance of country net foreign asset positions, size, and
capital account openness. We also re-assess the contribution of the global financial factor in
international capital flow pressures. The global factor explains a larger share of pressures on
currencies measured using the EMP compared with using capital flow quantities. However, this
global factor share is strongly dominated by idiosyncratic variation and only episodically large.

Introduction

International capital flows are consistently found to be important for economic outcomes and,
to a large extent, driven by global factors (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille, 2011; Forbes and Warnock,
2012; Fratzscher, 2012; Rey, 2015; Cerutti et al., 2019).1 These issues are the subject of different
strands of literature on the policy spillovers and spillbacks from international capital flows, and
the associated policy prescriptions. A key finding is that international capital flows tend to
enter emerging markets when global risk perceptions are low and global liquidity ample, and
retreat when global financial conditions tighten. Exchange rates also respond to global financial
conditions, with relative appreciations under elevated global risk aversion a feature of so called
safe haven currencies (Ranaldo and Soederlind, 2010; Botman, Filho and Lam, 2013; Habib
and Stracca, 2012; de Carvalho Filho, 2015; Bundesbank, 2014). The broader literature also
considers the currencies that exhibit outflow pressures with elevated risk, and addresses other
manifestations of the sensitivity of capital flow pressures to global financial factors such as the
failure of uncovered interest rate parity (Du and Schreger, 2016; Maggiori et al., 2019). This
sensitivity is key to understanding the degree to which local economies retain some domestic policy
autonomy and the relative importance of local and idiosyncratic factors (Miranda-Agrippino and
Rey, 2015; Obstfeld, Ostry and Qureshi, 2019; Cerutti, Claessens and Rose, 2019).
Features of the international monetary system may need to be more extensively accounted for
within this broader literature. In countries with flexible exchange rate regimes, exchange rates
move quickly in response to incipient changes in capital flows, supplementing or even obviating
the adjustment in capital flow volumes (Chari, Stedman and Lundblad, 2017). Without a fully
flexible exchange rate regime, policy interventions such as domestic policy rate changes or official
foreign exchange interventions imply that international capital flow pressures are neither fully
reflected in exchange rates or interest rates, nor in capital flows for many countries. Indeed, the
use of policy tools in response to exchange market pressures is pervasive, especially in emerging
markets, but also in some advanced economies (Ghosh, Ostry and Qureshi, 2018). Despite earlier
literature with more mixed conclusions, recent evidence points to foreign exchange intervention
with a high success rate under some criteria (Fratzscher, Gloede, Menkhoff, Sarno and Stohr,
2019). Accordingly, empirical studies that use cross-country data on realized capital flows or
exchange rate changes to inform the range of key questions in international finance cannot just
absorb these considerations in controls like country fixed effects. The use of these instruments
varies over time, as exchange rate and monetary regimes evolve (Klein and Shambaugh, 2008;
Ilzetzki, Reinhart and Rogoff, 2017).

In this paper we present a new measure to capture international capital flow pressures in
the form of a fully revamped and theory-based Exchange Market Pressure (EM P ) index. This
index is conceptually grounded in a simple model combining balance of payments equilibrium
and international portfolio demand conditions with adjustments for portfolio-related wealth effects. The international financial flow perspective and international portfolio balance approach
follow a long tradition (Girton and Henderson, 1976; Henderson and Rogoff, 1982; Branson and
Henderson, 1985; Kouri, 1981; Blanchard, Giavazzi and Sa, 2005; Coeurdacier and Rey, 2013;
Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas, 2016; Gabaix and Maggiori, 2015).
This EM P presents capital flow pressures in units of exchange rate depreciation equivalents
and can be viewed as a tool for measuring international capital flow pressures consistently across
countries and over time. It has the interpretation of a super-exchange rate index, directly accounting for observed currency movements, as well as monetary policy changes and central bank
interventions in the foreign exchange market by converting these into exchange rate depreciation equivalent units. The equivalency formulas basically take incipient pressures for example on
quantities of flows offset by foreign exchange intervention and solve for the exchange rate changes
that otherwise could have closed that balance of payments gap. The simple theoretical construct
also has the benefit of directly generating the range of domestic and foreign drivers around risk
sentiment, policy, and economic size that routinely appear in empirical analyses of the global
financial cycle and drivers of international capital flows (Calvo, Leiderman and Reinhart, 1993;
Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, 2015; Barrot and Serven, 2018; Avdjiev, Gambacorta, Goldberg
and Schiaffi, 2017b; Cerutti, Claessens and Rose, 2019).
As both proof of concept and a source of concrete results, we generate monthly EM P series
spanning 2000 through 2018, carefully computing these series for 41 countries. The performance
and features of our new EM P are then illustrated using country examples, focusing on four countries with diverse exchange rate regimes and currency characteristics: Australia, Brazil, Korea,
and Switzerland. The rich empirical relevance of the full country panel data is demonstrated
in two important topical applications. The first application revisits the asset pricing literature
approach to the identification of safe haven currencies, wherein currencies are characterized as
having ”safe haven” feature if valuations rise when global risk conditions worsen, as in Brunnermeier, Nagel and Pederson (2008), Ranaldo and Soederlind (2010), Habib and Stracca (2012),
Fatum and Yamamoto (2016) and Bundesbank (2014).2 Empirical analyses implemented using
observed exchange rate movements may generate distorted results if including the many countries
2

More recent papers by Avdjiev, Bruno, Koch and Shin (2019) and Avdjiev, Du, Koch and Shin (2017a) argue
that the correlation between risk sentiment and the dollar can proxy the shadow price of bank leverage and
explain cross-border bank lending. Wong and Fong (2013) is an exception in that they rely on options prices, and
so-called risk reversals, to gauge the degree to which financial market participants expect currencies to behave as
safe havens.

2

that respond to currency pressures by intervening in the foreign exchange market or by changing
the policy rate. The estimated correlations used for assessing safe haven or risk-on status are thus
subject to attenuation bias. We revisit this application, instead using the EM P to construct a
counterfactual excess currency return and its correlation with risk which we label the Global Risk
Response index (GRR). Our analysis shows that a couple of advanced country currencies have
safe haven status only sometimes (e.g. United Kingdom pound and Danish krone) and others
have this status more persistently (Swiss franc, Japanese yen, US dollar), with varying strength
of this feature over time. It also shows the comparative responses across countries of international
capital flow pressures to higher risk, with commodity currencies tending to fare worse than the
currencies of other advanced economies or emerging markets.
We also use these types of insights to revisit the analysis of Habib and Stracca (2012), which
carefully explores which country characteristics are associated with safe haven currency status
using an exchange rate based measure and time series panel regressions.3 Using the EM P
and GRR we show that the safe-havenness of currencies is exclusively an advanced country
phenomenon. Safe-havenness exhibits historical persistence as it is significantly related to its own
lag in advanced economies, but underlying factors that vary over time in advanced economies,
such as large net foreign assets positions, economic size, and financial openness, matter for overall
positive or negative risk consequences, while these factors are less relevant for the pressures
experiences by emerging markets.
As a second application, we use the EM P to revisit the Cerutti, Claessens and Rose (2019)
critique of the importance of the global financial cycle in international capital flows. Based
on panel regressions of net capital flows on global factors, those authors argued that the global
financial cycle is not as prominent a driver of international capital flows as argued in the influential
work of Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015) and Bruno and Shin (2015). Using our EM P as an
alternative measure of international capital flow pressures, we find that the proportion explained
by global factors is two to three times larger than would be measured using quarterly capital
flow data. Nonetheless, the strength of the global factor in explaining capital flow variation
is still under 25 percent and is highly episodic. These findings complement other research on
international bank claims and market-based flows showing that the importance of the common
global factor changes significantly over time with the balance sheet health of market participants
and the alignment of key country monetary policy paths (Avdjiev, Gambacorta, Goldberg and
Schiaffi, 2017b), and differs for extreme events or stress episodes characterized by capital stops,
flights, surges, or retrenchments (Forbes and Warnock, 2012). Local or unexplained factors still
3

Habib and Stracca (2012) acknowledge the potential attenuation issue that arises in their empirical analysis, as
currencies might appear as safe havens only because policy interventions keep these currencies pegged to the dollar
to various degrees. Their method of addressing such attenuation biases is to introduce foreign reserve changes
and interest rate changes as control variables in empirical specifications.

dominate global factors in general.
Finally, our research emphasizes that implementing the EM P empirically requires careful
data work. Important data decisions include choosing the reference currency for countries’ exchange rate regimes and selecting monetary policy rates. Another key data consideration includes
appropriately measuring foreign exchange interventions, including possibly accounting for use of
derivatives, and correcting official foreign exchange reserve changes for those arising from valuation effects. Important parameter decisions pertain to choices on capital flow elasticities, as these
are not well pinned down in the literature. Also consequential are treatments of the role of currency denomination in portfolios of foreign assets and liabilities (Benetrix, Lane and Shambaugh,
2015; Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger, 2019). While countries’ foreign assets are usually quoted
in equivalents of either domestic currency or US dollars, the currency denomination of countries’
liabilities is much more diverse.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the rationale for the exchange market
pressure index and discusses our approach in relation to early index variants. The model and
derivation for our EM P and related intuitions are provided. Section 3 focuses on empirical implementation, presenting important data and parameter choices, and illustrating results. Section
4 provides the application to safe haven currency status, the global risk response, and advanced
economies versus emerging markets differences. Section 5 presents the results contrasting the use
of the EM P and capital flows to quantify the global factor in international capital flow pressures.
The final section discusses the implications of our findings and concludes.

2.1

Exchange Market Pressure
Early Variants

Primarily used in studies of currency crises and spillovers of policies across borders, prior variants
of an exchange market pressure index take the form of a weighted index of changes in the exchange
rate, changes in official foreign exchange reserves and (sometimes) changes in policy interest rates:



rate et , defined as domestic currency per unit of foreign currency at time t over a ∆t interval.
∆Rt is the change in the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves as a proxy for foreign exchange
interventions. St scales these reserve changes, and ∆it represents the change in the policy interest
rate. wk are the weights at which components k = (e, R, i) enter the index. The weighting
choices wk utilized in the literature are presented in Appendix Table A1. These weights are
4

largely intended to filter out noisy signals generated by movements in exchange rates and official
reserves. The scaling choice St are intended to indicate the relative magnitude or importance of
official foreign exchange purchases or sales relative to the relevant country features. The weights
and scaling factors reflect the desire to have a practical basic measure to apply across countries
and time.
Despite delivering ease of implementation, these prior choices are not neutral for the realization of the index. The scaling of reserves affects the contribution of the amplitude of the reserves
changes to the EM P . Girton and Roper (1977) and Weymark (1995) scale the changes in reserves by the monetary base. The logic stems from questionable assumptions about the role of
domestic money in international financial markets, including perfect capital mobility and perfect
substitutability across assets issued by different countries and in different currencies.4 Kaminsky
and Reinhart (1999) instead scale by the level of reserves and Eichengreen et al. (1994) use a
narrow monetary aggregate. Scaling by the initial level of reserves results in a higher amplitude
of scaled reserve changes when the initial level of reserves is low, relative to when it is high.
Scaling by a monetary aggregate makes the scaling sensitive to the variation of money multipliers
over time and across countries. None of these approaches provide a meaningful concept of equivalence between the contributing components of currency depreciation and reserve losses within
the EM P .
Prior approaches to weighting the different components of the index likewise vary in both
economic relevance and conceptual underpinnings. Such conceptual underpinnings are extremely
important as the EM P , taken literally, fundamentally adds together price dynamics (changes in
exchange rates and policy rates) and flow quantity dynamics (official foreign exchange intervention). Weymark (1995) suggests that the change in reserves should be weighted by the elasticities
of money demand to interest rates and prices to the exchange rate, as these are the main channels
of balance of payments adjustment in monetary models. Tanner (2002) and Brooks and Cahill
(2016) apply equal weights to exchange rate and official reserves, giving movements in official
reserves prominant weight even for countries with fully floating exchange rates.5 Patnaik et al.
(2017) propose an EM P index that includes observed exchange rates and foreign exchange intervention, with a scaling factor proportional to the size and liquidity of the foreign exchange
market. Weights are based on an estimated sensitivity of the exchange rate to changes in official
4

Models based on money market equilibrium conditions are problematic, even if updated, since central banks have
engaged in quantitative easing or other policies that change the monetary base without relating to broader money
or the foreign exchange market.
5
In this latter case, observed official reserve movements are unlikely to reflect actual interventions and instead are
more likely due to portfolio valuation effects.

reserves.6 Most other studies remain “agnostic” as to whether such elasticities can be appropriately estimated or make sense, and instead employ precision weights. Precision weights essentially
weight the components of the index by the inverse of their sample variance, which ensures that
the variation in all the elements of the EM P contribute equally, and hence, that none of the
components individually dominate the index.7 However, exchange rate policy regimes should
substantively influence the relative role of the components, as noted by Li, Rajan and Willett
(2006). Precision weights give more weight to the component with less variation. In pegged
exchange rate systems, this tends to be the exchange rate, yet the changes in reserves clearly
contain more information on exchange market pressures when the exchange rate is pegged.

2.2

Modelling Exchange Market Pressures

Our approach to index construction rests on deriving a logical equivalence between the amount
of exchange rate depreciation, official reserve sales, or monetary policy changes that offset exogenous quantities of private capital flow pressures. The balance of payments equilibrium condition,
along with appropriately defined foreign asset and foreign liability portfolio equations, underpin
a derived equivalence. The balance of payments identity is foundational as it carefully tracks
interest payments on foreign assets and liabilities, foreign currency flows through trade, net and
gross flows of foreign currency assets and liabilities, and official foreign exchange interventions.
The simple logic of our approach is that any given excess supply or demand for a currency - an
international capital flow pressure - can be offset by an equivalent amount of foreign exchange
intervention quantity, by an endogenous exchange rate movement, or by a change in the domestic
monetary policy rate sufficient to generate a private balance of payments flow. The equivalence
factors across these components derive directly from the different ways that exchange rates and
interest rates enter the balance of payments identity and via appropriate specifications of international asset demand functions with imperfect asset substitutability. The equivalencies thus
depend on elasticities of response of foreign assets and foreign liabilities to exchange rate and
interest rate changes, the currency of invoicing or denomination on international trade and debt
positions, and the stocks of outstanding foreign asset and liability positions.
6

A separate strain of literature assesses the correspondence between central bank foreign exchange interventions
in a pegged system and exchange rate changes in a floating rate system, or the effectiveness of foreign exchange
interventions in affecting the exchange rate, e.g. Menkhoff (2013) and Blanchard, Adler and de Carvalho Filho
(2015). These studies find a positive correspondence between increases in central bank foreign asset holdings
in pegged regimes and exchange rate appreciation in a floating regime. The estimated correspondences carry
information about net capital flow responsiveness to the exchange rate, but are translated into quantitative proxies
for elasticities of gross private foreign investment positions. Patnaik et al. (2017) show how the correspondence
varies across countries, and explain this variation with cross country differences in trade, GDP and net FDI stocks
as proxies for local currency market turnover.
7
Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1994) offer a thorough discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of using this
weighting scheme.

The balance of payments (BoP ), expressed in foreign currency equivalents, reflects all sources
of demand and supply of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency arising from cross-border
payments needs during a specified period. The BoP for the period between time t − 1 and time
t (period t), is given by

where F XIt reflects foreign exchange interventions in period t. The first term on the right hand
side is the net trade balance accumulated in period t, N Xt . The second term in parentheses
reflects the net foreign investment income balance for period t, which includes interest receipts
accrued at the beginning of period t on private positions and on the foreign official reserve balance
Rt−1 . The exchange rate et is defined in units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency.
Private foreign assets and liabilities can be issued in domestic currency (superscript d) and foreign
currency (superscript f x). This distinction is important conceptually as it is relevant for how
exchange rates directly and indirectly influence foreign currency flows. The stock of net foreign
currency denominated assets at time t is defined as N F Aft x = F Aft x − F Lft x and net domestic
currency denominated foreign liabilities are defined as N F Ldt = F Ldt − F Adt . Countries that
borrow internationally exclusively in domestic currency and exclusively hold foreign currency
denominated foreign assets have N F Aft x = F Aft x and N F Ldt = F Ldt , and gross and net foreign
positions are the same.8 The interest rates used to calculate interest income and payments
accrued to foreign assets and liabilities depend on the currency of denomination. Interest income
denominated in domestic currency is assumed to accrue on the beginning of period stock of
foreign positions, and is converted into foreign currency equivalents using the beginning of period
exchange rate et−1 . The last term in parentheses captures financial account transactions taking
place during period t. These are expressed in foreign currency equivalents, converted using the
beginning of period exchange rate. Financial account transactions do not include changes in
aggregate net foreign asset positions due to valuation effects from exchange rate changes, as
valuation changes do not give rise to transactions or payments needs per se.9
The international financial flow perspective and international portfolio balance approach follow the long tradition of Girton and Henderson (1976), Henderson and Rogoff (1982), Branson
and Henderson (1985), Kouri (1981), Blanchard et al. (2005), Coeurdacier and Rey (2013), Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2016), and Gabaix and Maggiori (2015). We assume imperfect

This was implicitly assumed to hold for all countries in an earlier version of this model, presented in Goldberg
and Krogstrup (2018).

Exchange rate valuation changes in foreign wealth, which are first order, can trigger rebalancing of portfolios that
affect financial account transactions. Second order valuation changes in the foreign currency value of domestic
currency denominated flows could occur, but we leave this out through the simplifying assumption that flows are
converted at the beginning of period exchange rate.

substitutability between domestic and foreign currency denominated assets, modeled as home bias
for domestic currency denominated assets, following Blanchard et al. (2005) and consistent with
the empirical evidence on home currency bias in international portfolios by Maggiori, Neiman
and Schreger (2019).10 Demand for net private foreign assets denominated in foreign currency,
and net liabilities denominated in domestic currency (and hence foreign currency from the perspective of the foreign creditor) are functions of relative expected returns, expressed as deviations
from uncovered interest rate parity (uipt ), risk sentiment pertinent to each country’s investment
decisions, st and s∗t , and domestic and foreign financial wealth, Wt and Wt∗ respectively, both
expressed in terms of their local currencies. The portfolio demand equations are given by:

such that αs and αs∗∗ are positive.11 κ and κ∗ are indices of home and foreign capital account
openness respectively. Capital openness indices moderate the share of investable wealth held in
foreign currency denominated assets, scaling the realized net foreign currency investment shares.
This specification simplifies the derivations substantially, as it generates direct proportionality
between quantities (net foreign currency assets and liabilities) and the degree of capital account
10

Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger (2019) show that currency denomination of assets is the main factor driving
demand and home bias. When currency of denomination is accounted for, remaining credit risk differentials
among assets largely do not explain asset demand patterns. Camanho, Hau and Rey (2018) provide a recent
examination of home bias in portfolio models using equity fund data.The role of the sign and size of the foreign
currency mismatch in cross border portfolio adjustments is well known. Krogstrup and Tille (2018) discuss this
role and provide evidence in the case of banks.

openness, or conversely, the strength of capital controls.12 Plots of capital controls against gross
foreign assets and liabilities in percent of GDP confirm a negative relationship particularly on
the foreign liabilities side (Fernandez, Klein, Rebucci, Schindler and Uribe, 2016), lending some
support to our modeling approach.13
Wealth, expressed in domestic currency equivalents, consists of domestic assets DA (or DA∗
for foreign investors) and net foreign assets, including domestic currency d and foreign currency
f x denominated assets and liabilities:
Wt = DAt + et N F Aft x − N F Ldt
1
Wt∗ = DA∗t + N F Ldt − N F Aft x
et

(6)

The evolution in domestic wealth is captured by dwt , which can be interpreted as domestic real
GDP growth and real asset valuation changes, as well as wealth changes due to changes in the
exchange rate which alter the domestic currency value of foreign denominated net assets due to
currency mismatch:

(7)

An appreciation of the foreign currency increases the domestic currency value of net foreign
currency denominated assets, and hence wealth, if the home country is net long in foreign currency
denominated assets, i.e. has more foreign currency denominated assets than liabilities.14
To arrive at an expression for the change in demand for foreign currency denominated assets
as a function of its various drivers, we totally differentiate (3) and (5), substitute in (7) and
rearrange terms:

By implication, as the level of net foreign currency assets and liabilities already reflects the ex ante strength of
capital controls, independent data on ex ante capital controls is not needed for the empirical implementation.

Alternatively, if the κ terms were multiplied with the α functions, e.g. N F Aft x = W
· [1 − κα(uipt , st )], the
et
proportionality is lost and the κ terms will show up in the derivations independently of the levels of positions. Or,
the κ terms could be multiplied with the arguments inside the α functions, which would result in a specification
that reduces the sensitivity of capital flows to deviations in uip or to risk shocks, without affecting the levels of
net currency positions. In some countries, changing the incidence of capital controls can be used as a capital flow
management instrument, as can prudential policy instruments.
13
We confirm this relationship for net foreign assets by currency (not shown).
14
If interest rates change the deviations from interest parity or if risk sentiment changes, the desired allocation of
wealth between domestic and foreign currency denominated assets may change but total current wealth is not
affected.

The first term captures the reduction in the demand for foreign currency assets when holding
constant the total wealth in domestic currency equivalents and the share of this wealth that is
allocated toward foreign assets. The second term captures the portfolio reallocation away from
foreign currency assets triggered by the expected future depreciation from a current appreciation
through a widening of the deviation from uip. The third term captures the effect of an increase in
total wealth due to the higher value of the net share of wealth invested in foreign currency assets
(a wealth valuation effect due to a foreign currency mismatch). If the wealth valuation effect does
not outweigh the first two portfolio rebalancing terms, the elasticity is negative, i.e. a domestic
currency depreciation leads to a reduction in home’s demand for foreign currency assets. If the
wealth valuation effect instead dominates, the sign of the elasticity could shift.

When expressing the change in foreign currency asset demand in terms of elasticities, the capital
control indices cancel out. The role of capital controls appears implicitly in the quantities to
which the derived elasticities apply, i.e. the net foreign assets in foreign currency and net foreign
liabilities in domestic currency.
Differentiating the BoP expression (2) with respect to all arguments that can shift, inserting
equations (8) and (12), and rearranging yields the final form for the derived Exchange Market

The EM Pt , given by the top line of equation (16), is expressed in units of depreciation against
the foreign reference currency. πe,t and πi,t are conversion factors. The second line of equation
(16) reflects the drivers of exchange market pressure, directly mapping to terms that appear
in the broader literature on capital flows and global financial cycles. Foreign policy rates and
risk sentiment appear prominently, as do exogenous forces which increase domestic and foreign
investable wealth.
This measure of exchange market pressures, including its derived conversion of quantities of
F XI and monetary policy into currency depreciation units, is highly intuitive. πe,t converts a spe11

cific quantity of foreign exchange intervention into the equivalent domestic currency depreciation
units. The larger the πe,t , the smaller the equivalent currency depreciation that would have been
needed to offset the capital flow gap reflected in sales of foreign currency reserves or increases in
domestic policy rates. The size of πe,t is determined by the strength of the near term mechanisms
through which exchange rate depreciation could generate a private balance of payments volume
response equivalent to the volume gap which would otherwise be bridged by official F XI. πe,t
is increasing in the net export sensitivity to the exchange rate and generally increasing in the
country’s net foreign currency asset and net domestic currency liability positions. A domestic
currency depreciation expands the uip deviation and generates portfolio reallocations, reducing
net foreign demand for home currency liabilities and net domestic demand for foreign currency
denominated assets. Countries with larger initial net positions have larger net changes.
Valuation effects on the net position also play a role (equation 9). The larger is the net long
position in foreign currency investments of home investors, the greater is the wealth effect when
the domestic currency depreciates, spilling over into expanded foreign asset demand through this
channel. Similarly, the longer are foreign investors in Home currency, the more it will reduce their
wealth when the home currency depreciates, which will lead to a reduction in foreign investment
in Home (a capital outflow). These wealth effects have the potential to reduce πe,t if home
investors are sufficiently long in foreign currency, or if foreign investors are sufficiently long in
home currency investments. Being short in foreign currency investment (e.g. when domestic
banks fund in foreign currency) can conversely increase πe,t .
πi,t determines the contribution of interest rate changes to the EM P . Comparing the mathematical expressions for πi,t and πe,t shows that under the assumption of moderate valuation
wealth effects in the exchange rate elasticities, πi,t is likely to be larger than πe,t , suggesting that
interest rate basis point changes contribute relatively more than one-for-one to exchange rate
depreciation equivalents in the EM P .

Empirical Implementation

Constructing the EM P requires careful implementation choices. This section discusses the data
and parameterization decisions. The baseline EM P is constructed using monthly data for 41
countries listed in Appendix Table A2, spanning both advanced economies and emerging markets
starting in 2000 and extending through the end of 2018.

3.1

Key Data Choices

Implementation of the EM P relies on appropriate data series. First, it is important to capture
official foreign exchange interventions accurately. When authorities do not publish F XI data,
12

choosing accurate approximation and justments are key. An additional choice is the reference
currency used for assessing the pressures on a currency. Third, rates used for monetary policy
need to be selected. Finally, the measure of portfolio elasticities of the response to uip and risk is
important. Trade volumes respond slowly to changes in interest and exchange rates, and for the
purposes of implementation in monthly data, we assume that short run trade balance elasticity
N X 0 = 0, and

E(et+1 )
et

≈ 1.

The core data are drawn from national central banks, the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics (IFS), and International Investment Positions and International Exposure data (Benetrix, Lane and Shambaugh, 2015). Extended coverage of the EM P back in time is achieved by
supplementing some quarterly data with earlier annual values of gross foreign assets and liabilities.
All data sources and definitions are provided in Appendix Table A3.
3.1.1

Country Sample and Time Period

The countries included in our sample are chosen based on data availability. We include countries
for which the construction of the EM P start in 2002 at the latest, beginning in 2000 for most
countries.16 Because the EM P relies on exchange rate variation, we exclude countries that do
not have their own currency, or have multiple official exchange rates. The euro area as a whole
is included, but individual euro area countries are excluded.17 Appendix Table A2 presents the
country sample while Table A3 describes the data sources and definitions. Data sample and
descriptive statistics are provided in Table A4 for the period from January 2000 to December
2018. EM P values for Advanced and Emerging Markets, with subperiods of pre-crisis (2000m12007m6), crisis (2007m7-2009m6), and post-crisis (2009m7-2018m12), are described in Table
A5. IMF country classifications sort countries into Advanced Economies versus Emerging and
Developing economies.
3.1.2

Capturing Foreign Exchange Intervention

Studies of foreign exchange intervention (F XI) often rely on changes in published IMF official
foreign reserves data by country-date. This approach can, however, generate biased values for
actual F XI because exchange rate changes induce valuation effects. These valuation effects arise
because central bank reserve portfolios are typically comprised of assets spanning a basket of
currencies, instead of exclusively being invested in a single base currency. US dollar denominated
16

Even when data is available, we have also excluded very small countries, defined as having population size below
half a million or annual per capita income average since 2002 below US dollars 1000.
17
We include Estonia and Latvia up until their dates of entry into the euro area in January of 2011 and 2014
respectively, but do not include countries that joined the euro earlier. We do not include Slovenia and Slovakia,
which joined in 2007 and 2009 respectively. Venezuela is excluded based on lack of clarity about the relevant
official exchange rate for capital account transactions.

13

assets, on average, represent 60 to 65 percent of total foreign reserve portfolios, with euros dominating the remainder (Goldberg, Hull and Stein, 2013; Eichengreen, Chitu and Mehl, 2016).18
Accordingly, the value of official reserves reported in US dollar equivalents fluctuates with the
exchange rate vis-à-vis the other currencies in which the reserve assets are held. Indeed, appropriately accounting for valuation changes and active accumulation or depletion of reserves is a
central contribution of the comprehensive discussion by Dominguez et al. (2012).
We address the valuation distortions by measuring F XI spot interventions using a combination of three complementary approaches, depending on data availability. Published data on
official interventions are used when available, which is the case for 10 countries. In the absence
of published data, we estimate F XI based on official reserve flows from national balance of payments statistics, when these are available in monthly frequency, which is the case for an additional
15 countries. Balance of payments data is based on transactions and is hence net of valuation
changes, although it does contain interest receipts on foreign assets requiring an additional correction. For the remaining countries and time periods, we adjust changes in official foreign reserve
positions for valuation and interest receipts. The procedure we follow is described in our online
appendix on Measuring Foreign Exchange Interventions.
Some central banks also intervene in foreign exchange markets using methods that go beyond
the more traditional spot sales and purchases of currency. The additional methods include off
balance sheet derivatives instruments such as foreign currency forwards and futures, swaps and
options intended to better target interventions (e.g. Domanski, Kohlscheen and Moreno, 2016;
Kohlscheen and Andrade, 2014). Different reasons for such interventions include the need to
target specific markets or meet foreign currency liquidity needs. It is not clear how various
derivatives instruments map to a spot-intervention equivalent measure and the availability of
derivatives data is limited. Accordingly, we exclude this adjustment from our measure of F XI.
Our online appendix includes a list of the countries for which available data suggest accounting
for derivatives may be important.
3.1.3

Reference Currency for the EMP

The EM P can be constructed vis-à-vis the main monetary reference currency of the country or
vis-à-vis a common international currency like the US dollar. We use the Klein and Shambaugh
(2008) classification system for selecting the main reference currency by country and date.19 In
practice, most countries have the US dollar as reference currency, with the exceptions of a number
of European non-euro countries which have the euro as main reference currency (and had the
18

Data on the full currency breakdown of central bank foreign currency reserves is not readily available in cross
country comparable data sources. The IMF’s COFER database keeps data for individual countries strictly
confidential, providing a breakdown across advanced economies and emerging and developing countries.

Deutsche mark before the euro), Singapore, which has the Malaysian baht as reference currency,
and New Zealand which has the Australian dollar as reference currency. The US and the euro area
are each other’s country of reference currency respectively. In exercises that compare patterns in
the global financial cycle and the safe haven characteristics of currencies across countries, the US
dollar is used as a common comparison currency for all other countries.
3.1.4

Measuring Monetary Policy and Risk Changes

Home monetary policy rates directly enter the EM P as interest rate changes. Foreign interest
rates are drivers of pressures. We use policy interest rates from national central banks or from
the IFS when available, and complement these with other types of short-term interest rates when
needed (Table A3). As short term policy rates do not fully reflect monetary policy measures when
countries are near or at the zero lower bound (ZLB), we also use a shadow policy rate generated
by Krippner (2016) for the US, UK, Japan, and euro area in the ZLB periods.
As measures of global risk, we follow the literature and focus on changes in the V IX index
of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). We also compare with a constructed global
risk aversion shock from Habib and Stracca (2012) for robustness. These risk aversion shocks,
updated by Habib and Stracca, correspond to conditions of i) an increase in the V IX plus ii) a fall
in the return of a global unhedged (in local currency) stock portfolio, with the series normalized
to mean zero.
3.1.5

Currency Denominations of Foreign Assets and Liabilities

Distinguishing foreign currency and domestic currency positions is relevant for understanding
wealth and interest rate effects (Maggiori, Neiman and Schreger, 2019). On the foreign liability
side, the range of experiences across countries is broad, with shares spanning about 20 percent to
nearly 90 percent. While the pre-crisis period (2000-2008) had higher foreign currency shares in
liabilities compared with the early post-crisis period (2009-2012), the order of magnitude remained
high for many countries (Benetrix, Lane and Shambaugh, 2015). Foreign assets are much more
likely to be denominated in foreign currencies, generally exceeding 90 percent (Appendix Figure
A1).

3.2

Portfolio Elasticities

Available evidence supports our central portfolio mechanisms, as foreign shares in investors’
portfolios respond significantly positively to a currency depreciation shock (Hau and Rey, 2004;
Hau and Rey, 2006; Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock and Wongswan, 2014). The net foreign asset and
liability elasticities with respect to exchange and interest rates used in the EM P are fundamental

15

concepts, yet consensus elasticity estimates are not available. Part of the explanation for this
gap is that identifying causality from exchange and interest rate movements to international
capital flows is difficult. Recent insights are drawn from analyses of specific types of flow data,
typically portfolio equity flows at the level of investment funds, which allow for more granularity,
higher frequency, and an assessment of the relative timing of exchange rate and capital flow
changes. Mutual funds in the US, UK, Eurozone, and Canada exhibit economically relevant
portfolio rebalancing that is symmetric for both positive and negative changes in excess returns
(Camanho, Hau and Rey, 2018). Moreover, the sign and size of the foreign currency mismatch
in bank balance sheets affects the response of bank cross border funding flows to exchange rate
changes (Krogstrup and Tille, 2018). Securities-level investment positions support distinguishing
mutual fund portfolio sensitivities into domestic versus foreign currencies (Maggiori et al., 2019).20
Country aggregate data on components of global liquidity shows that elasticities of flows to
domestic policy rates, US policy rates, and risk sentiment vary across market-based finance versus
banking flows (Avdjiev, Gambacorta, Goldberg and Schiaffi, 2017b). Implied elasticities, relevant
for Fk A , Fk L where k = e, i, s in the EM P suggest that a 100 basis point increase in local policy
rates tends to raise external debt growth rates by between 0.5 and 1 percent in a quarter, while
sensitivities to a 100 basis point increase in the Federal Funds Rate (or shadow rate equivalent) are
higher, reducing growth rates by between 5 and 8 percent in a quarter. Panel regression results
directly based on the net foreign currency asset and net domestic currency liability data for
our sample of countries and time frame yields similar order of magnitude effects.21 The exchange
rate elasticity estimates suggest that a 1 percent exchange rate depreciation against the US dollar
should lead to a 0.05 percent reduction in foreign asset holdings in the following quarter (i.e. a
capital inflow due to domestic resident retrenchment). Moreover, a 1 percentage-point increase
in the domestic interest rate is estimated to induce a 0.14 percent retrenchment in domestic
residents’ foreign assets (i.e. a gross resident inflow). Due to the potential for attenuation bias as
discussed above, these estimates are likely to be lower limits for the elasticities. Results suggest
stronger responses in emerging markets than in developing countries. The exchange rate elasticity
in the foreign liabilities regression is of similar absolute size to that found in the foreign asset
regression.
The baseline EM P used for our applications is constructed using a range of sensitivities of
home and foreign portfolio demands to interest and exchange rates. We choose Fe A and Fe L =
0.10 and consider the alternatives of [0.05, 0.15]. We use Fi A and Fi L values that are three times
as large as the associated exchange rate elasticities values for robustness.
20

The role of the US dollar in international portfolios has been unique in recent history. When foreigners buy US
securities, they predominantly buy dollar-denominated securities, behaving like US investors.
21

details and limitations.

reflects how much one

unit of F XI offsets currency depreciation. Constructed as post-crisis period monthly average
values, Figure 1 shows the range of F XI conversion factors for advanced economies (red bars)
and emerging market (blue bars) when F XI is valued in billions of US dollars. For the countries
with the lowest conversion factors, a one billion US dollar foreign currency intervention (sale)
offsets up to 3 percentage points of currency depreciation. The potential conversion rate is
much higher for larger emerging markets like Thailand, Mexico, India, Brazil, Russia, India and
China. Most advanced economies have implied conversion rates that are an order of magnitude
smaller than those for emerging markets. For example, the

1
Πe,t

conversion factor suggests that

a one billion US dollar intervention would instead deliver a currency depreciation offset of less
than 0.5 percentage points for Canada, Switzerland, Hong Kong and Japan. The US and euro
area direct implied intervention effects would be even smaller, consistent with a long literature
that emphasizes the role of oral interventions and scale, which is measured relative to GDP for
Fratzscher, Gloede, Menkhoff, Sarno and Stohr (2019) and relative to foreign exchange transaction
volumes for Patnaik, Felman and Shah (2017). This type of magnitude consideration is consistent
with skepticism around the opportunity cost of holding very large stocks of reserves for the largest
economies (Goldberg, Hull and Stein, 2013).

17

3.3.1

Country-specific Examples

We next provide the EM P and its sensitivity to parameter choices. Four specific countries are
used: Australia is selected as a commodity currency economy with a floating exchange rate,
Brazil as an emerging market, Korea as a small open economy that has both experienced substantial pressures and used multiple instruments, and Switzerland as an advanced country that
has actively used all three respective components of the EM P .
Figure 2 compares the EM P and the contributions of its component parts. A positive EM P
denotes an international capital outflow pressure (local currency depreciation pressure), and a
negative EM P denotes a capital inflow pressure (local currency appreciation pressure). The
EM P for Australia, with its floating exchange rate, is primarily driven by exchange rate fluctuations, as would be expected. The three other countries occasionally or periodically intervene in
foreign exchange markets and their EM P s are to a large degree driven by both exchange rate
fluctuations and F XI. The contribution of the domestic policy rate changes are smaller.
The difference between results when the EM P is based on the US dollar and the EM P is
based on the euro, shown for Switzerland, illustrates the importance of the choice of reference
currency used in the EM P . Switzerland’s reference currency is the euro, per the Klein and
Shambaugh (2008) classification. The EM P construction based on bilateral exchange rates visá-vis the euro, with euro denominated changes in official foreign reserves, suggests a smaller
role for exchange rate fluctuations and a larger role for F XI to stabilize this relationship, in
capturing capital flow pressures than suggested by the EM P based on the US dollar. In general,
the choice of reference currency is particularly important during episodes when exchange rate
changes dominate the index, but less so when reserves changes clearly dominate, as in the latter
period for Switzerland.
The advantages of the EM P as a measure of balance of payments pressures include its comprehensiveness (i.e. covers all net non-reserve flows) and monthly frequency, as well as its comparability across different countries, currency regimes, and over time. Hence, it allows for an
assessment of the link between capital flow pressures and global factors at a higher frequency and
greater consistency across countries than accomplished using realized capital flow data based on
Balance of Payments Statistics and global liquidity series. Figure 3 compares the baseline EM P
with quarterly net private capital outflows in percent of GDP for Australia, Brazil, Korea, and
Switzerland representing different degrees of exchange rate management across both time and
countries. The sign and the direction of change in the EM P and realized net private capital
flows are constructed to be directly comparable under the assumptions of the model.22 As the
level and amplitude of these two series are not comparable, for this illustration net capital flows
22

If the current account persistently deviates from zero, this would lead to an average net capital flow reflecting
the current account which would not constitute a capital flow pressure.

Figure 3: EM P and Net Private Capital Outflows, Quarterly Averages.
Quarterly averages of monthly values of the EM P against the US dollar and normalized net capital
outflows in percent of GDP. Net capital outflows are normalized to have the mean and standard deviation
of the EM P series, for comparability. Positive values reflect net capital outflows and depreciation pressures
against the reference currency. Negative values reflect net inflows and appreciation pressures.

As expected, the degree to which the EM P correlates with actual international capital flows
depends on the currency regime in place. In countries where the exchange rate is freely floating,
capital flow pressures result in more exchange rate adjustment, which in turn moderates realized
private capital flows. Switzerland before 2008, when the exchange rate was freely floating, is a
good example as in in Figure 3. In contrast, when the exchange rate is highly managed, capital flow pressures materialize in a private net capital flow which may be fully accommodated
by changes in central bank foreign reserves or policy rate changes that stunt the exchange rate
response. This has been the case in the post-crisis period for Switzerland, when the lower bound
on interest rates resulted in a shift in monetary policy toward more active exchange rate man20

agement.23 More generally, the correlation of the EM P with realized capital flows is dependent
on currency regime. Capital flow pressures as captured by the EM P , and actual capital flows,
are more correlated for countries with a higher degree of exchange rate management, and less so
in countries with floating rates. This observation underscores the advantage of the EM P as a
measure of capital flow pressures that is comparable across exchange rate regimes. It highlights
the risk that research studies that are reliant purely on exchange rates or purely on capital flow
data may miss important aspects of capital flow pressures, with results subject to attenuation
biases.
3.3.2

Robustness: Country-specific Illustration

A central robustness consideration in the construction of the EM P pertains to the assumed
elasticities of international portfolio adjustment to components of the uip. Our baseline approach
constructs the EM P using an exchange rate elasticity of 0.10 and an interest elasticity of 0.30.
As we have already discussed, the literature has not adequately converged on the stylized facts
for such elasticities by country or over time. If the true empirical elasticities are substantially
different, the baseline EM P will be inexact particularly for countries that manage their exchange
rate using either F XI or dit . Under a fully floating exchange rate regime, reserves and interest
rate changes are less important, in which case the scaling of F XI and di will matter less (and the
EM P overall is less of a contribution) as the exchange rate component of the index dominates.
We have performed extensive robustness analyses to alternative parameterizations. The role
of altering the exchange rate elasticity assumption is illustrated in Figure 4, which displays the
baseline EM P and two alternative versions constructed using the exchange rate elasticities of 0.05
and 0.15, and the interest elasticities of 0.15 and 0.45 respectively, for our four sample countries.
Australia is the country with least exchange rate management, and also the country for which the
exchange rate elasticity assumption matters the least. For all countries, the applications using
the three alternative elasticity EM P s generate pressures in the same direction, but with the scale
of contributions by F XI and dit shifting accordingly.

Understanding Safe Haven Currency Status

As a first broader empirical application, this section uses the EM P to identify so-called safehaven status currencies and show the risk-on status of other currencies. We consider EM P
and associated uip correlations with measures of global risk sentiment to construct a global risk
response (GRR) index. We then revisit the question of which country features are correlated with
23

The large realized capital inflow in late 2008 and early 2009 in Switzerland is related to the large scale foreign
exchange swap operations carried out by the Swiss National Bank during this period.

more pronounced positive or negative global risk responses of international capital flow pressures,
as addressed in Habib and Stracca (2012). Section 5 builds on these insights by re-examining the
importance of the global factor in international capital flows and the global financial cycle. We
show that the EM P mitigates some attenuation bias on the size of this factor that arose in prior
studies that exclusively rely on exchange rates (asset prices) or capital flows (asset quantities).

4.1

A Safe Haven Currency Index

In the asset pricing literature on safe-haven currencies, currencies are defined by exhibiting excess
returns during risk-off episodes (Brunnermeier, Nagel and Pederson, 2008; Ranaldo and Soederlind, 2010; Habib and Stracca, 2012). Underlying this definition is a presumption that excess
22

currency returns are driven by an increased demand for the currency during such risk-off episodes.
However, in countries where authorities intervene to prevent the currency from responding to an
increased demand, this safe-haven demand is also reflected in F XI or policy rate reductions;
the excess return constructed based on observed exchange rate movements alone is subject to
attenuation bias. The EM P can be thought of as a “super-exchange rate”, or a counterfactual exchange rate movement that captures both observed and incipient pressures on a currency
through the balance of payments. As the EM P allows us to capture such manifestations of safe
haven demand for a currency consistently across exchange rate regimes, we revisit the features of
countries that are associated with safe haven status. First, we compute a counterfactual excess
return (cerj ) to holding currency j, defined as the monthly rate of counterfactual appreciation of
the exchange rate of currency j against the US dollar, relative to a US dollar investment:
certj = −EM Ptj + ijt − i∗t

(19)

where EM Ptj is expressed in terms of domestic currency units per US dollar. An increase means
a counterfactual depreciation of the domestic currency, and it hence enters with a minus. ijt and
i∗t are short-term money market or policy rates applying to a one-month holding period.
A currency j exhibits safe haven demand characteristics on average during the period from
t − x to t, if its uncovered excess returns rise when risk shocks are higher
GRRtj = corrt−x,t (certj , vt ) > 0

(20)

where vt is a measure of a global risk shock, for example as captured by variation in the V IX or an
alternative constructed measure such as the Habib and Stracca (2012) global risk aversion series.
We call this correlation the Global Risk Response index, the GRR, with positive values reflecting
currency appreciation and inflow pressures relative to those weighing on the US dollar (or other
reference currency) when risk increases. We refer to currencies with persistently negative GRR
as risk-on currencies. Persistently positive values are consistent with a currency having a safe
haven interpretation.
Constructed here as a rolling five year correlation with the V IX, the resulting GRR exhibits
substantial variation over time and across countries.24 This dynamic is illustrated by the four
sample countries shown in Figure 5. The Swiss franc consistently exhibits safe haven status with
GRR > 0, particularly when measured against the euro. This status episodically would appear
much weaker if the GRR were constructed using the observed exchange rate instead of with
the EM P . Against the US dollar, the sign of the GRR based on the observed exchange rate
24

Observations for the GRR are based on 5 years of prior monthly data. If pre-2000 EMP data are unavailable for
some countries, some early GRR observations will be missing from the regression sample.

consistently depreciating and with declining uncovered returns when risk rises. The Korean
GRR is another interesting example, strongly demonstrating the type of attenuation bias on
status when the pressures on a currency are measured using observed exchange rates instead
of using the counterfactual EM P . In the pre-crisis period, the exchange rate based measure

country. The bars are color-coded by AE (red) and EM (blue) countries. The depicted EM P for the US
is measured against the euro.

Across the full sample of 41 countries in the post-GFC period, a small group of countries
exhibit consistent safe-haven status, with GRR > 0, based on correlations between the baseline
EM P and the V IX (bottom panel of Figure 6). The Japanese yen, the US dollar (measured
against the euro), and the Swiss franc have this status through 2018. The Swiss franc status is
most pronounced when measured relative to the euro (Figure 5). In the remaining countries with
positive average GRRs, these are occasionally significantly different from zero for Denmark. The
rolling GRR chart for the UK pound (Appendix Figure A2) shows positive correlations through
2008 against the dollar, while correlations post-GFC fall below zero and are not significant. The
safe haven status of the UK pound extended to 2014 when measured against the euro (not shown).

25

A larger group of currencies consistently exhibit what we refer to as risk-on currency status,
with negative values of the GRR. These include so-called commodity currencies like the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Norwegian Krone, the South African rand, the Brazilian
real, and the Russian ruble. Many other emerging markets and small advanced economies show
less pronounced risk-on currency status with smaller but negative GRR values. As illustrated by
Figure 6, within the sample of advanced economies color coded in red the measured variation in
the risk response is large, both qualitatively and quantitatively. For some countries the indicated
strength of these effects is starkly different when measured purely using exchange rates instead of
the EM P as these tend to be countries that intervene in currency markets. Appendix Figure A2
provides time series patterns across each country. Results are broadly similar when constructed
using the global risk shock measure of Habib and Stracca (2012) instead of the VIX (not shown).
Overall, this safe haven analysis based on the EM P confirms that three currencies, the Swiss
franc, the Japanese yen and the US dollar, most consistently behave as so-called safe havens.
Beyond earlier findings, our index takes into account that some safe haven currency pressures are
manifested in policy interventions, such as for the Swiss franc in the post-crisis period. The safe
havenness of the Swiss franc remained intact during this period when measured appropriately.
Countries may have stronger risk-on behavior of currencies than suggested by analyses constructed
just with the exchange rate, especially if policy interventions are used systematically to attenuate
exchange rate responses, as exemplified by subperiods in Korea.

4.2

Drivers of Safe Haven Status

With excess returns in uip terms as the dependent variable, Habib and Stracca (2012) explore
which country characteristics are associated with currencies having safe haven status. The underlying hypotheses, beyond inertia explanations, are that a currency may be “safe” if: i) the
issuing country is itself safe and low risk; ii) its financial markets are large and liquid; and iii) it
is financially open and global. The variables used for testing the contributions of these categories
respectively include i) net foreign assets in percent of GDP, public debt to GDP, inflation levels,
and country risk as measured by average interest differential; ii) country size in world economy,
stock market capitalization to world GDP, and private domestic credit to GDP; and iii) capital
account openness (Chinn Ito) and gross foreign assets and liabilities to GDP. Using monthly data
from 1986 to 2009 for 51 currencies, and in specifications inclusive of lagged dependent variables,
Habib and Stracca (2012) find the most consistent indicator of safe haven status to be country net
financial assets, along with country size and stock market capitalization relative to world GDP.
The role of net foreign assets is consistent with our modeling approach and home currency bias.
In countries where residents hold larger foreign currency assets than issued domestic currency
liablities, the home bias response to risk would tend to be dominated by residents repatriating
26

foreign investments.
We revisit this regression approach to identifying drivers, instead using the certj as dependent
variable, constructed relative to the US dollar, and utilizing data spanning 2000m1 to 2018m12.
The specifications use a sample of 40 countries, excluding the US as the US dollar is the reference
currency and US monetary policy is a control variable. The estimation equation is:
certj = αs ds∗t + βΩjt ∗ ds∗t + γΩjt + +δdi∗t + ζ j + εjt

(21)

where certj is the counterfactual excess return using the super-exchange rate EM P and the
short-term interest differential for country j at time t; ds∗t is the global risk shock introduced as
the V IX; and di∗t is US monetary policy. Global risk enters estimation specifications directly
and interacted with country-time specific variables, with each country variable also entering
specifications in non-interacted form. The Ωjt are country-characteristics bundled according to
the three hypotheses and presented together in groups in the columns of the results tables. The
regressions are run for the entire time sample, separately for the pre- and post- crisis periods, and
for emerging markets versus advanced economies. In order to keep the regression results tables
concise, tables show estimated β and omit presentation of estimated αs , γ, and δ. A parallel set
of regressions also have been run using the global risk shock constructed in Habib and Stracca
(2012), with very similar results that are not shown.
Table 1, columns I and VI provide results based on a specification excluding Ωjt for the
advanced economies and emerging markets countries respectively. On average, higher risk is
associated with lower excess returns across currencies, over time, and in both advanced economies
and EMs. Columns II and VII show that the counterfactual excess returns based on the EM P
are related to prior safe haven or risk status computed by interacting the V IX with the lagged
GRRtj . Results shown in column II for advanced economies (column VII for emerging markets)
indicate that the past safe havenness is a significant predictor of how the excess return responds
to global factors in the sample of advanced economies, while the typical risk-on status in the
sample of emerging markets is not significantly persistent.
We subsequently investigate whether this correlation can be explained by sets of fundamental
variables, following the spirit of the analysis in Habib and Stracca (2012). Columns III and VIII
contain regression results including the set of variables typically associated with country risk. Net
foreign assets are associated with safe havenness in both country samples. However, the direction
of this effect differs for advanced economies and emerging markets. Large positions for emerging
markets are associated with depressed excess returns under elevated risk, while the opposite is
observed for advanced economies. The interest differential and the level of public debt matter
in the advanced economy subsample. Public debt is significant with the wrong sign, however,

possibly reflecting reverse causality if demand for public debt is higher in countries considered
more safe.
Columns IV and IX introduce the set of macro fundamental variables reflecting size of economy
and financial market development. Economic size matters in advanced economies, with larger
advanced economies less risk responsive or with more tendency toward safe havenness.
Columns V and X introduce variables that capture financial openness: an index of capital
controls (the Chinn Ito index) and a de facto measure in the form of gross foreign assets to
GDP. The Chinn Ito index is significant only for advanced economies, suggesting that advanced
countries with more open capital accounts are more likely to be safe havens.
To conclude, using the counterfactual excess return based on the EM P instead of excess
returns based on observed exchange rate changes allows us to capture safe haven patterns in
currencies across exchange rate regimes. Our analysis of the drivers of such patterns confirms
some of the determinants found in the literature, but shows a sharp distinction between advanced
economies and emerging markets. We confirm that net foreign assets are a key determinant but
directionally distinct across groups. We do not find financial market development to be important
in differentiating risk behavior of currencies across emerging markets, however.

The Global Factor in Capital Flow Pressures

While highly statistically significant in many empirical studies, the importance of the global factor
and global financial cycle in international capital flows is disputed by Cerutti et al. (2019). Their
analysis focuses on the contribution to capital flow variation and uses net capital flow measures,
some of which are subject to the attenuation bias addressed by the EM P as discussed in Section
3.3.1. Below we revisit the global factor analysis of capital flow pressures, instead applying the
EM P in comparable empirical specifications.

5.1

The EMP and Global Liquidity Drivers

As shown explicitly shown by equation 16, global factors comprise changes in the foreign interest
rate (di∗t ), changes in global financial risk sentiment as captured by ds∗t , and changes in global
financial wealth. Regressions for advanced economies and emerging market economies thus are
conducted using the panel estimating equation over monthly or quarterly data:25
EM Ptj = βs ds∗t + βi∗ di∗t + βsd ds∗t Dtj + Dtj + ζtj + εjt
25

where j-superscripts denote the country, ζ j is a country-specific fixed effect, and the global
financial risk sentiment and global interest rates are global factors. Dtj is a dummy taking the
value one in country months where the lagged GRRtj is positive and significantly different from
zero at the 10% level. We expect a positive sign for βi∗ , i.e. a higher foreign interest rate should
induce capital outflows and thus increase the EM P , all else equal. The sign for βs depends on
sensitivities to increases in risk perception. As discussed, the literature traditionally has found it
to be positive for emerging markets, in that risk-off sentiment has been related to outflows, and
negative for so-called safe haven countries (Habib and Stracca, 2012; Ranaldo and Soederlind,
2010). We hence expect βs to be positive and βsd , accounting for safe haven countries, to be
negative. For each country sub-sample, we run the regressions for the entire period from 2000m1
to 2018m12, and for three sub-periods including the pre-financial crisis, the GFC period and the
post crisis period. There are no instances of persistently significant safe haven currencies in the
emerging market sample, where the interaction with a dummy variable is excluded.
In the baseline specification, global financial risk sentiment is measured by fluctuations in the
V IX, following both the safe haven regressions and prior global factor studies (e.g. Forbes and
Warnock, 2012; Rey, 2015). Recent research on global financial factors and capital flows brings
into question the ability of the V IX or other indices to consistently capture global financial
risk sentiment over time (Cerutti, Claessens and Rose, 2019; Avdjiev, Gambacorta, Goldberg
and Schiaffi, 2017b; Krogstrup and Tille, 2018; Shin, 2016). We hence follow the more robust
approach of Cerutti, Claessens and Rose (2019) and capture global common factors in alternative
specifications by including time fixed effects in lieu of changes in the foreign interest rate and
the V IX. Time fixed effects indiscriminately capture all global factors that affect capital flow
pressures in the same way across the panel countries, including part of the impact of the V IX,
the foreign interest rate, foreign financial wealth changes and other possible global factors that
similarly impact the sample countries. The time fixed effect allows us to assess how much of the
variation in capital flow pressure can be accounted for by common responses to global factors,
but does not allow us to assign the global factor to individual types of drivers. Moreover, country
specific variation not captured by time fixed effects can still be a response to global factors, if
this response differs from the response of the average country of the sample.
The baseline panel regression results are displayed in columns I-V of Table 2 for the two
subsamples and the different time periods. Changes in the V IX are significantly positive, as
expected, in largely all specifications. The safe haven dummy interaction term is significantly
negative in the crisis and post-crisis samples, capturing the qualitatively different global risk
response of these countries. The overall share of variation explained by global factors reflected
by the V IX is low, at under 1 percent, but slightly higher in the crisis period.
Column VI presents the results in the full sample including period fixed effects and excluding

the V IX and i∗ . Time fixed effects substantially increase the share of explained variation in the
EM P . The share is highest, over 17 percent, in the advanced economy sample. Column VII
presents results for the full sample using data on the EM P in quarterly frequency and compares
the estimates with those using data on net capital flows in percent of GDP as in the literature on
global factors in capital flows. Both regressions include period fixed effects as measure of global
factors, and additionally account for safe haven characteristics in the advanced economy sample.
31

The share of variation explained in the EM P regression is three times larger than the net capital
flows regression for advanced economies, and somewhat larger in the emerging market sample.
The EM P as a gauge of capital flow pressures thus points to a stronger role for a global
financial cycle than observed when realized aggregates for international capital flows are analyzed.
26

This could derive from the fact that the EM P accounts for different types of manifestations of

pressures (in flows or prices) instead of exclusively in outright international flows, especially for
countries with more de facto flexibility in exchange rates. The share of variation that is explained
in global factor regressions based on the EM P remains relatively modest, however. The results
(columns I to V) are largely robust to using the observed US policy rate instead of a shadow rate,
to using the global risk shock instead of the V IX, and to using the EM P against the reference
currency instead of exclusively the US dollar (not shown).

Conclusions

This paper has introduced a new measure of capital flow pressures in the form of an exchange market pressure index. While exchange market pressure indices have a long tradition, our approach
has a solid grounding in international financial portfolio theory, balance of payments accounting,
and recent advances in understanding investment flows across borders. The EM P measure takes
into account the form of exchange rate regime in place at each point in time, the returns on gross
foreign assets and liabilities in different currencies, and the drivers of gross foreign asset and
liability positions at the country level. This index can be computed for a broad panel of countries
and over time, offers monthly variation in international capital flow pressures with at most a
few months of lag, and takes into account actual observed variation as well as incipient capital
flow pressures. The EM P has a super exchange rate interpretation, as both foreign exchange
intervention and monetary policy are mapped into currency depreciation equivalents. Disadvantages are that the index is constructed rather than observed as data, and construction relies on
assumed baseline portfolio response parameters with associated scope for mismeasurement.
The EM P is a useful tool for avoiding the type of attenuation bias that arises when exchange
rates or capital flows are independently used in cross-country and time-series empirical analyses.
This usefulness has been demonstrated with country examples and in two applications addressing
current issues in international finance. First, we show that excess return or EM P correlations
with risk sentiment measures provide informative insights into safe haven currency flows as well
as risk-on status of other currencies. The country characteristics that drive these results differ
across advanced and emerging markets, but underscore the importance of country size, net foreign

asset positions, and financial openness. Second, we show that the EM P is a useful alternative
to the exchange rate and international capital flow series in quantifying the importance of the
global factor across advanced economies and emerging markets. Our analysis confirms that the
global factor is sizable, but also highly episodic. The EM P -based analysis explains significantly
more cross-sectional and time variation than found exclusively based on capital flows, but still
provides results supporting the dominant role of idiosyncratic factors in international pressures.
We expect that ongoing research on time-variation in portfolio flows will aid continued refinement
of the baseline EM P . Overall, our measure recognizes the richness of important differences in
exchange rate and monetary regimes across countries and time, and advances our understanding
of international capital flow pressures.

We have used the largest possible set of countries and excluded countries based on the following set of
criteria: (1) data availability does not allow for construction of the EM P starting in 2002m12 at the
latest, or until 2017m1 at the earliest, (2) very small countries, defined as countries with population
size of less than 0.5 million and with GDP per capita of less than 1000 US dollars and (3) a number
of individual countries for idiosyncratic reasons: Venezula (lack of clarity on the relevant exchange rate
measure reflecting market pressures), Turkey, Paraguay, Belarus, Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Moldova,
Philippines, and observations prior to 2002m1 for Armenia, Brazil and Ukraine, and prior to 2001m1 for
Hong Kong and India (inadequate or inconsistent data on foreign currency exposures in foreign investment
positions).

Measuring Foreign Exchange Interventions

This appendix describes the construction of the measure of F XI used in the EM P , as discussed
in Section 3.1.2. The empirical measure of F XI that we use is based on estimates for official
spot interventions:
F XItj = F XItj,spot

(1)

F XI spot can be based on published interventions data, on interest-adjusted official reserves
flows or on interest and exchange rate valuation adjusted changes in official reserve assets, depending on data availability. Interest and valuation exchange rate adjustments rely on a proxy
for the currency composition of official reserves. The details of how we measure or proxy each of
these are described in the subsections below.
Alternatively, F XI can also include derivatives, such that F XI has two components:
F XItj,alternative = F XItj,spot + F XItj,deriv

(2)

There are some countries for which accounting for derivatives F XItj,deriv may be important
based on available data.
Korea is a case in point, as illustrated in Figure 1. The blue bars reflect Korean official
inventions in currency forward and futures markets while the gray bars reflect our measure of
Korean spot interventions. Spot and derivatives interventions are somewhat correlated, such that
spot interventions will tend to reflect, but underestimate, the total size of official FX interventions
in Korea.1
The best source of spot foreign exchange interventions data are data published by the national
authorities, and we use these whenever available. Ten countries publish interventions data in
monthly or higher frequency, including India (since 2002), Argentina (since 2003), Canada (since
2008), Japan (since 1991), Euro area (since 2008), Australia (since 1989)2 , Brazil (since 2000),
Mexico (since 1996), Israel (since 2002) and Russia (since 2008). A drawback with using national
sources of published interventions data is that the definitions and coverage are not always clear and
not necessarily consistent across countries. For example, Australia divides published interventions
data into spot, swaps and other derivatives, but most of the other countries do not clearly disclose
whether the published data contain derivatives interventions. We assume that when no further
information is given, the published data reflect spot interventions.
A difference between published official interventions data and estimates based on adjusted
1

In other countries, such as New Zealand, the correlation between estimated spot and derivatives interventions can
be low to negative.

Figure 1: Korea: Spot and Derivatives F XI and Changes in Official Reserves
In billions US dollars, spot and derivatives interventions are stacked. Spot interventions are computed
as monthly reserves flows from the balance of payments adjusted for interest receipts using COFER EM
currency weights as described in Appendix 1 (source: Bank of Korea and IMF). Derivatives interventions
are computed as predetermined short-term net drains on official reserves from long and short official
forward and futures positions (source: IRFCL template, IMF). Changes in reserves are based on data
from the international investment position (source: IMF).

changes in reserve positions or flows, as discussed below, is that official interventions data will
often exclude operations due to non-exchange rate management aims, such as issuance of foreign
currency debt by the government. Whether or not the latter reason for fluctuations in foreign reserves should be included in the measure of interventions depends on the government’s reasons for
issuing such debt. For practical reasons, we use published official foreign exchange interventions
when available and do not attempt to include general government foreign exchange operations.3
See also Bayoumi et al. (2015) for a discussion of this issue.

1.1

Currency Weights in International Reserves

In the absence of published data on foreign exchange interventions, we use either balance of
payments flows or changes in the positions of official foreign reserves, adjusted for changes due
to interest receipts and exchange rate changes, as described below. For this, we need data on the
currency composition of official reserves. Some central banks disclose their currency composition
3

This issue is relevant for Canada, for which published interventions data are far smaller in amplitude than other
measures of spot FXI based on adjusted changes in reserve positions or flows, with the main difference being the
role of the central bank’s handling of the government’s issuance of foreign currency denominated liabilities.

of reserves. Switzerland publishes currency weights from 1999. A set of countries report currency
weights for more recent years through the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity (IRFCL), used by authorities to report to the IMF (Dominguez et al., 2012;
Adler et al., 2019).4 We use the earliest available observations to fill in missing values for earlier
years. For the remaining countries that do not disclose currency weights, we use average currency
weights in official reserves as published in the IMF’s COFER (Currency Composition of Official
Foreign Exchange Reserves) database. These are divided into Advanced Economies and Emerging
and Developing countries, and we separate the sample accordingly. COFER shares include US
dollars, euros, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and Swiss
francs. Since COFER data end in 2015Q1, we use 2015Q1 currency composition data to fill the
missing observations going forward. Hong Kong does not publish currency shares in their official
foreign reserve, but since it has a currency board in US dollars, it is likely to hold a large part,
if not the entire official reserve, in US dollar denominated assets. This is confirmed in McCauley
and Chan (2014). Average EM COFER weights are hence likely to be misleading for Hong Kong,
for which we instead assign a currency weight of 100 percent to US dollars.
For each country when data are available, we calculate the share of euros before 1999 as the
sum of Deutsche marks, ECU, French francs and Netherlands currency.

1.2

Spot F XI Based on Balance of Payments Data

When countries and time periods for which published F XI data are not available, but balance
of payments data are available in monthly frequency, we adjust official foreign exchange reserve
flows for interest receipts according to the formula:5

where ORFt,BOP
and Rt,IIP
are the official reserve inflows (defined as increases in reserves)

the balance of payments and international investment position statistics respectively. iR
g is the
interest received on foreign assets held in currency g and wg is the weight of the official reserve
held in currency g denominated assets.
Dominguez (2012) finds that most central banks place foreign assets in long-term safe bonds.
Following Dominguez (2012) and Adler et al. (2019), we use data on long-term yields on the

payments data are available, we adjust changes in official foreign exchange reserve positions from
the international investment position for interest receipts and exchange rate valuation changes:

where ∆Rt,IIP
is the change in the foreign reserve position in US dollars, and egU Sdollars is

the exchange rate of the US dollar against currency g, defined in units of g per US dollar. The
proxies for interest receipts and currency weights are as described above.
The spot leg of currency swaps is included in the foreign exchange reserves in the general case,
but not in certain cases, including the bilateral central bank swaps in Switzerland and the US
(Goldberg, Kennedy and Miu, 2011; Rose and Spiegel, 2012; Andries, Fischer and Yesin, 2016;
Bahaj and Reis, 2018). The recipients of the swaps lent the obtained international currencies
on to domestic financial institutions in need of international funding (notably in US dollars and
Swiss francs). In the absence of these swaps, the financial institutions needing foreign funding
would arguably have sought to purchase this funding in the market, which would have led to
pressures on conventional FX interventions or on the exchange rate.
In Switzerland, the spot leg of the central bank bilateral swaps issued in 2008 and 2009 were
recorded separately from the foreign reserve in the balance sheet (this is not the case for spot legs
of currency swaps with market participants). Since monthly data exist on these swaps, we add
this separate balance sheet item to the foreign currency reserve for Switzerland before adjusting
its changes for exchange rate valuation changes and interest receipts. In the US, the spot leg of
the bilateral central bank swaps are also not included in the foreign reserve. Monthly data on
the spot leg for the US are not available, however, and we therefore do not adjust in the case of
the US.

1.4

Measuring Derivatives Interventions

An alternative definition of FX interventions includes derivatives interventions, as captured in
expression 2. Accounting for the use of derivatives in interventions poses challenges. One is that
the set of instruments used in FX interventions is evolving over time. Another challenge is that
the correspondence between spot interventions and derivatives interventions will depend on the

4

type of instrument used, and the reporting of derivatives and spot interventions is not always
transparent and consistent. Finally, not all derivatives interventions are conducted to manage
the exchange rate, but can also be targeted toward financial or market stability.
We again make use of the IRFCL data template. In this template, IMF member countries
report official predetermined short-term net drains on foreign currency assets due to aggregate
short and long positions in forwards and futures in foreign currencies vis-à-vis the domestic
currency (including the forward leg of currency swaps, but not the spot leg). Since they are
reported in terms of the net drains on reserves arising when the derivatives contracts mature (and
not in terms of the market value or mark-to-market of the positions), these data are comparable
to changes in reserves due to spot transactions.
Since the spot leg of currency swaps enters the official foreign reserve for the duration of the
swap in most cases, a swap is recorded as a spot intervention today, combined with the opposite
predetermined net drain due to the forward leg, and these two legs cancel out in the measure of
interventions when derivatives interventions are included. Without a correction for the forward
leg through the predetermined net drains, however, currency swaps figure as spot interventions.
It is not apriori clear which of the two representations is correct. This will depend on FX market
functioning and term FX demand, issues that go beyond the scope of this paper.
Not all derivatives interventions are included in the short-term predetermined net drains,
however. Some are instead reported in other lines in the IRFCL template. For example, foreign
currency options may never lead to a drain on reserves, and are hence not included in the predetermined net drains category, while they may have had strong effects on hedging demand and
hence currency markets. It is not clear how to translate the use of such derivatives into a measure
comparable with spot interventions consistently across countries, instruments and time, and we
leave that for future research.
Figure 2 depicts the average share of variation in total alternative F XI measure based on
equation 2 that is accounted for by variation in the derivatives term by country, for the individual
country with available derivatives data as given in Table 1. A high share reflects either strong
use of derivatives by authorities (New Zealand and Korea are examples). In these cases, not
accounting for the use of derivatives may weaken the signal of capital flow pressures in the estimated F XI. In other cases, a high share reflects some use of derivatives while spot interventions
are extremely low, which is typically the case in countries with freely floating exchange rates
(e.g. Australia, Japan, EU, the UK and Canada). In these cases, it is less clear that derivatives
interventions are important to account for.
Due to the lack of a clear and consistent accounting for derivatives interventions across countries, the unclear link between derivatives and spot interventions, and the limited availability of
derivatives interventions data in many countries, we do not include derivatives inventions in our

The construction of estimated F XI is based on a combination of published spot interventions data or estimates based on BOP flows or changes in IIP stocks of
foreign official reserves, as described in the text. F XI derivatives can be added. The columns of this tables provides the available data ranges for each of these data
sources by country, illustrating which data are used for F XI construction by time range. When two time ranges are provided, this indicates breaks in series for
which data are not available. There are occasional missing values within the available derivatives data ranges, see IRFCL template for details.

Exchange and Interest Rate Elasticities from Panel Regressions

This appendix presents a panel regression of flows in foreign assets and liabilities on exchange and
interest rates, with the aim of assessing the size of the elasticities of foreign investment positions to
exchange and interest rate changes, as discussed in Section 2.2.
Estimating the response of capital flows to the exchange rate is complicated because of the
endogeneity of capital flows and exchange rates to each other as well as to the exchange rate regime
in place in the country in question. For example, we would expect an exchange rate appreciation to
initially cause a capital outflow as international portfolios rebalance. However, we would expect a
capital outflow shock to cause an exchange rate depreciation, or foreign exchange interventions (see
also Klaassen, 2011). We only observe the equilibrium outcome for flows and the exchange rate,
but not the partial responses that we are interested in assessing. There is hence clear potential
for attenuation bias. We attempt to address these issues with a panel regression analysis of gross
F A,j
F L,j
capital flows that produces empirical estimates of N
and N
based on equations (3) and
e
e

(4). In this setup, endogeneity would tend to bias the estimates of the capital flow response to the
exchange rate toward zero. Thus, if we find the right signs, we should be capturing the direction
qualitatively and gain insight into the lower bound for the size of the response. To reduce the
potential bias, we lag all explanatory variables by one quarter, keeping in mind that lagging may
not fully address concerns in case of persistence in the regression variables. It also further increases
the potential for attenuation bias as flows are likely to respond contemporaneously to exchange
rates. Allowing an exchange rate shock to affect capital flows over the following three months is
consistent with the timing of the effect estimated in Hau and Rey (2004), however.
With a broad panel of countries, the country specific variation in the exchange rate depends
on the exchange rate regime. Countries with hard pegs, such as Hong Kong, will have minimal
exchange rate variation, effectively preventing empirical measurement of the impact of exchange
rate variation on private capital flows.6 For this reason, we estimate the regression as a panel and
impose the restriction that the elasticity of gross positions to the exchange rate is the same across
groups of countries, as further discussed below. The panel approach allows us to produce predictions
for exchange rate elasticities for countries that do not exhibit sufficient variation in the exchange
rate to estimate the country specific elasticity. The panel approach also allows us to control for
variation in gross positions due to common global shocks by including time fixed effects.
It is possible that the average elasticities of international investment positions depend on the
composition of gross foreign asset and liabilities (e.g. Cerutti, Claessens and Puy, 2015), which
may change over time. It is beyond the scope of this paper to estimate elasticities individually
for all sub-items of international investment positions. As a short-cut, we exclude foreign direct
investments (FDI) from the gross foreign investment positions. The share of FDI in gross positions
6

Patnaik et al. (2017) face a similar problem and carry out estimations only for countries where variation allows for
identification of the parameter they are focusing on. They then use the estimation equation to predict the parameter
estimates for the countries that do not have sufficient variation to allow direct estimation, based on the characteristics
that turn out to matter for the size of the parameter estimate.

has grown strongly in recent years (Milesi-Ferretti and Lane, 2017), but this type of investment is
less likely to respond to exchange rate changes.7 Portfolio and bank related international investment
positions are more likely to be responsive to changes in prospective returns, absent capital controls.
We are interested in how investors respond actively to changes in exchange and interest rates
and therefore consider transactions, i.e. flows, rather than changes in stock positions that contain
valuation effects. This means that we cannot make an assessment for currency specific net foreign
asset and liabilities positions, for which we only have stock data. Instead, we approximate net
foreign assets in foreign currency by gross foreign assets, and net foreign liabilities in domestic
currency by gross foreign liabilities. We then match capital flows in these categories to the stock
positions to compute our dependent variable.
Global financial factors such as US monetary policy, risk aversion, global liquidity, and financial
wealth accumulation are clearly of importance in driving global capital flows and should be controlled for, but these variables are very difficult to correctly measure empirically, in particular since
the advent of the ZLB period.8 Since these factors are not the focus of this exercise, we instead
control for all common global factors by including time effects in the regressions. We control for
country specific time invariant effects by including country fixed effects. Finally, growth in local
wealth is approximated by local GDP growth. The estimating equations become:

where ϕj are country fixed effects that capture time invariant country specific factors influencing
gross capital flows, and τt are time fixed effects that capture global factors including risk sentiment,
global liquidity, and interest rates, financial conditions and growth in center countries (the V IX is
hence not included explicitly). c is the country grouping for which the elasticity is estimated. In the
baseline regression we restrict the elasticities to be the same for all countries, but we also allow for
the elasticities to deviate between advanced economies and emerging and developing countries, by
interacting all explanatory variables with a dummy taking the value one for emerging and developing

The parameter estimate signs and sizes are relatively robust to changes in the sample and
estimation procedures (not shown), but significance varies a lot with the sample. Note that the
fit of the regression (R2 ) is relatively high. This primarily reflects a large portion of the variation
explained by country and time fixed effects, in turn reflecting structural flows as well as global

A further refinement of the approach would be to exclude long-term bank positions, if these could be consistently

All specifications contain time and fixed effects (not shown). Regressions are based on quarterly data from

factors.
Columns I and II display the results from the baseline regressions where elasticities are restricted
to be the same across advanced economies and emerging and developing economies. In the foreign
asset regression, the exchange rate elasticity and interest rate semi-elasticity have the right signs
and the former is marginally significant (column I). The exchange rate elasticity estimate suggests
that a 1% exchange rate depreciation against the US dollar should lead to a 0.05% reduction
in foreign asset holdings in the following quarter (i.e. a capital inflow due to domestic resident
retrenchment). Moreover, a 1%-point increase in the domestic interest rate is estimated to induce
a 0.14% retrenchment in domestic residents’ foreign assets (i.e. a gross resident inflow). Due to the
potential for attenuation bias as discussed above, these estimates are likely to be lower limits for the
elasticities. GDP growth is also significant and with the right sign. When allowing the parameter
estimates to differ across country samples (column III), significance is reduced and the results
suggest stronger responses in emerging markets than in developing countries. When allowing for
the elasticity to differ between advanced countries and emerging and developing countries (column
II), significance drops, but the size and sign remain, suggesting that the elasticity is higher for
emerging and developing countries.
In the foreign liabilities regressions (columns II and IV), the exchange rate elasticity has the
right positive sign and is of similar absolute size to that found in the foreign asset regression, which
is what we would expect. It is not significant, however, and the interest rate parameter estimate
has the wrong sign.
