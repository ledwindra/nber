Why Have Corporate Tax Revenues Declined?

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the source of changes in corporate tax revenues

during the last twenty—five years. It finds that legislative changes explain
less than half of the revenue decline during this period. Falling corporate
profits have had a larger influence on revenue collections than all
legislative changes taken together, a result that is often obscured in studies

focusing solely on the average corporate tax rate. Changes in capital
recovery provisions are the most important legislative factor influencing
corporate tax revenues, especially in the last five years.

The paper also considers the impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The
new law will increase the average tax rate on corporate profits by

approximately 10 percent. By 1990, the average tax rate will equal its level
in the late 1970s, although it will remain substantially below its level in
the 1960s and the early 1970$.

Corporate income tax revenues have declined dramatically during the last

two decades. The corporate tax accounted for almost twenty percent of federal
receipts during the 1960s, compared with only seven percent of federal

receipts in the last five years. Federal corporate taxes averaged 3.9 percent
of GNP during the first five years of the 1960s, 2.7 percent of GNP for the
first five years of the 1970s, and only 1.4 percent of GNP for the first five

years of the 1980s. In 1985, the tax to GNP ratio was less than half what it
was ten years ago, and only one quarter as large as in 1955. In 1982, real
corporate tax payments were lower than in any year since 1940. Although
corporate taxes in each of the last three years were substantially greater
than in 1982, the average level of tax receipts remains at its postwar low.

The erosion of corporate tax revenues is widely regarded as the result of

legislative changes. For example, a frequently cited study by Mcintyre (1984)
argues:

The decline of the corporate tax began with the adoption of the
investment tax credit in the 1960s, and continued into the 1970s
as Congress adopted one loophole after another in response to
corporate lobbyists.., the largest single blow to the corporate
tax came in 1981 with the passage of ... the Accelerated Cost
Recovery System, which opened up massive new possibilities for
corporate tax avoidance. p.1]
This viewpoint clearly influenced the architects of the recently-enacted Tax

Reform Act of 1986. The new laws stringent corporate minimum tax of
20 percent, coupled with significant reductions in capital recovery
allowances, will raise corporate taxes by $120 billion during the next five
years.

This paper examines why corporate taxes have declined. It decomposes

—2—

movements in federal tax receipts into components attributable to changes in
tax rates, changes in tax preferences, changes in corporate profitability, and

other factors. The results suggest that while legislative changes have been
important contributors to the decline of corporate tax revenues, they account

for less than half of the change since the mid-1960s. Reduced profitability,
which has shrunk the corporate tax base, is the single most important cause of
declining corporate taxes.

The paper is divided into five sections. The first section documents the
decline in corporate tax revenues during the last three decades. Section 2
presents a simple division of changes in corporate taxes into components due

to changes in tax rules and changes in the corporate tax base. It shows that
during the last twenty years, while the average tax rate has fallen by nearly

one third, corporate profitability has declined by a factor of two. Section 3
examines the factors which have been most important in reducing average

corporate tax rates. It focuses on changes in capital recovery,
inflation—induced misstatement of corporate profits, and various legislative

changes. The fourth section examines the expected revenue gains under the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, and presents preliminary evidence on how the bill will

alter average tax rates. There is a brief conclusion.

1.

The WitherinQ Corporate Income Tax

The decline in corporate taxes played an important part in stimulating

recent calls for tax reform. The withering of the corporate income tax,
however, began long before the passage of the Economic Recovery Tax Act in

—3—

1981. Corporate tax payments as a share of GNP or the value of corporate
assets have been declining for nearly three decades. This trend accelerated
during the last five years, when real corporate taxes also declined.

Table 1 presents four measures of the net corporate tax payments by

nonfinancial corporations. We measure tax payments net of refunds obtained by
carrying current losses back to offset prior taxes, and including taxes

collected as a result of audits or other retabulations. A detailed
description of our data series is provided in the appendix. We focus on
nonfinancial corporate firms (NFCs) because they were most significantly

affected by the changes in capital recovery rules under ERTA. The NFCs
accounted for eighty-nine percent of corporate tax revenues in 1984 and 1985,

and movements in their tax payments track total taxes very closely. There are
also a number of detailed tax provisions which affect financial firms (see
Galper and Neubig (1983)) that we avoid by focusing on the NFCs.

The first column of Table 1 reports the NFC's real corporate tax

payments, measured in 1986 dollars. These tax payments peaked at $92.5
billion in 1968, and with the exception of three years in the late 1970s, have

been substantially below this level ever since. Average tax payments by the
NFCs were $78.6 billion in the 1960s, $76.4 billion in the 1970s, and $49.6

billion for the last five years. The data demonstrate the recent decline in
corporate tax revenues, however, since average payments for the 1976-80 period
were 63 percent greater than average revenues in the last five years.
This decline in corporate taxes is even more remarkable when viewed in

the context of the growing economy. The second and third columns in Table 1
describe corporate taxes relative to GNP and corporate assets. Corporate

Data on tax receipts from the nonfinancial corporate sector are based
on authors' calculations, which is described in the appendix.
Receipts are net of carryback refunds and audit-induced tax payments.

—4-

taxes averaged 3.7 percent of t3NP during the 1960s, compared with 1.3 percent

during the first half of the 1980s. In 1982, when corporate taxes reached
their postwar low, they accounted for only 0.9 percent of GNP. An equally
pronounced decline emerges from column three, which shows the ratio of tax
payments by nonfinancial corporations to the net replacement value of the-jr

tangible assets. This asset measure is constructed by subtracting corporate
debt outstanding from the replacement cost of corporate tangible assets, and
provides a natural scaling variable for corporate taxes since it reflects

changes in the size of the corporate sector. Tax payments by NFCs averaged
4.6 percent of net assets during the first five years of the 1960s, and were

even higher at the end of the 1950s. The tax—to-asset ratio has fallen by a
factor of three during the last twenty-five years. For the five years ended
1985, it averaged 1.5 percent, and it fell below 1 percent in 1982. Taxes as
a percent of assets fell by 1.4 percent between the 1961-65 and 1971-75
periods, and declined by as much again during the last ten years.

Corporate taxes have also become a substantially less important part of

the federal budget. They accounted for 6.5 percent of revenues during the
most recent five years. By comparison, corporate taxes were nearly three
times as important, accounting for 18.7 percent of federal revenues, during

the 1961-65 period. The rapid growth of federal revenues from other sources,
particularly social insurance taxes, coupled with declining corporate taxes to
explain the pronounced reduction in the corporate tax share during the last
twenty-five years.

2.

Declining Tax Rates vs. Declining Tax Base

The decline in corporate taxes can be divided into two components: a
decline in the rate at which corporate profits are taxed, and a decline in

corporate profits themselves. The first component is the average tax rate,
which has attracted widespread attention in the tax policy debate of the last
five years (see Joint Tax Committee (1984) or Spooner (1986) for example).
Many analyses of the corporate tax focus exclusively on the average rate,

however, and imply the misleading conclusion that its movements are the sole

cause of recent reductions in corporate tax revenues. This section
demonstrates that while average tax rates have -in fact declined, changes in

corporate profits, the base of the corporate income tax, are an
equally—important factor -in explaining the change in corporate taxes.

2.1 Effective Tax Rates and the Tax—to-Asset Ratio
The tax—to--asset ratio is the product of the average tax rate and the

corporate profit rate:

TAXES/ASSETS = (TAXES/PROFITS)*(PROFITS/ASSETS).

(1)

PROFITS denote the real economic profits earned by corporate equity-holders,1

TAXES/PROFITS is the average effective tax rate, and PROFITS/ASSETS defines

the real economic profit rate. PROFITS excludes foreign source income of U.S.
corporations, since our asset measure includes only domestic capital. A
detailed description of our measure of economic profits is provided in the
appendix.

Table 2 presents data on the tax-to-asset ratio, the average tax rate,

and the profit rate for each year since 1959, the year when some IRS data used

in our calculations first became available. The data clearly indicate that
both falling average tax rates and a decline in profitability have contributed
to lower corporate taxes.

The average effective tax rate is 41.8 percent

during the 1960s, compared with 30.8 percent during the last five years, a

decline of more than one quarter. Average tax rates declined throughout the
1970s, averaging 43.4 percent for the 1971-75 period and 40.1 percent for the

1976-80 period. The average effective tax rate for the 1981-1985 period was
9 percent lower than its value for the 1976—80 period. This decline is twice
as large as the drop between the first and second halves of the 1970s.
The second column of Table 2 reports the economic profit rate on

nonfinancial corporate capital. The profit rate trends down throughout our
sample period, but drops particularly sharply in the 1980s. From an average
of 10.9 percent during the 1960s, the profit rate fell to 7.2 percent during

the 1970s and 4.9 percent during the last five years. In 1982, when corporate
taxes reached their postwar low, the corporate profit rate was also at its

lowest level (2.9 percent). Although profits accruing to equity holders have
rebounded since then, averaging 6.3 percent in the last two years, they are
still well below their level in the previous two decades.
This dramatic decline in corporate profits is an important source of

lower corporate tax receipts. The last column of Table 2 shows that the
tax—to-asset ratio at the beginning of the 1960s, for example, was 3.1 times

—7—

that at the beginning of the 1980s. The average effective tax rate was 1.35
times its level in recent years, while the profit rate was 2.2 times its

recent value. Declining profitability is therefore substantially more
important than changes in the average tax rate in accounting for the reduction
in corporate taxes.

The relative importance of changes in tax rates and the tax base can be
illustrated by calculating what corporate tax receipts in the early 1980s

would have been if either of the average tax rate or the profit rate had

remained at its earlier level while the other changed over time. Actual
corporate tax receipts averaged 49.6 billion 1986 dollars in the 1981—1985

period. If the profitability of corporate assets had been the same as in the
1960s, tax receipts would have more than doubled to $110.4 billion. Even
setting the profit rate equal to its value for the 1976-80 period would have

increased annual revenues by over $20 billion, to $72.5 billion. Fixing the
average effective tax rate at its earlier level would also have raised taxes,

though not by as much as the return to earlier profit levels. If the tax rate
during the last five years had returned to its level in the early 1960s, taxes

would have averaged $68.4 billion per year. Replacing the actual tax rate
with its average value for the late 1970s would raise tax receipts by
$13 billion to $62.5 billion per year.

2.2

Interpreting

the Average Tax Rate

Although our division of the tax-to-asset ratio into average tax rate and
profit rate components may provide some insight into the source of declining

tax revenues, the two components are not independent. The nature of the

-8-

corporate income tax makes the average tax rate critically dependent upon the
level of corporate profits. For taxable firms, many corporate tax deductions,
such as depreciation allowances and tax credits, may be claimed regardless of

the level of profits. A one percent increase in profits therefore raises the
firm's taxable corporate income by more than 1 percent, increasing the average
tax rate.

An offsetting effect arises for non—taxable firms. For firms with
negative taxable income and no capacity to carry losses back against prior
taxes, current tax payments will be zero regardless of how negative their real

economic income is. An increase in profitability will not affect their taxes.
It will, however increase their economic profits, which enter the denominator

of the average tax rate calculation for the entire corporate sector. These
links between profitability and tax rates make it impossible to interpret

changes in the average tax rate solely as the result of legislation.

A simple example can illustrate these points. Consider a firm that
purchases a capital asset for $1000 and is entitled to tax depreciation
allowances of $150 per year, while the asset's true economic depreciation is

$100 per year. If the firm uses no debt and has no other inputs to the
production process, then its real economic profits are its receipts less $100.

If the economic profit rate is 7 percent, receipts will equal $170 and the

firm's taxable income will be $20. Assuming a flat-rate corporate income tax
with a 0.50 marginal rate, the firm pays $10 in taxes for an average tax rate
of 10/70 =

.142, and a tax-to-asset ratio of .01. Now consider what happens

if the economic profit rate rises to 10 percent, bringing receipts to $200.
Taxable income rises to $50, so taxes are $25, the tax-to-asset ratio is .025,

—9-

with a 0.50 marginal rate, the firm pays $10 in taxes for an average tax rate
of 10/70 = .142, and a tax-to-asset ratio of .01. Now consider what happens
if the economic profit rate rises to 10 percent, bringing receipts to $200.

Taxable income rises to $50, so taxes are $25, the tax-to-asset ratio is .025,

and the average tax rate is 0.25. Shocks to corporate profits therefore affect
measured average tax rates, even when the tax system is held constant.

To illustrate how, if some firms have tax losses, increased profits can
lower the average tax rate, we introduce a second firm.

It owns assets

identical to those of the first firm, which earns a 7 percent return, but -it

operates in a different market with a 3 percent profit rate. Its receipts are
$130, taxable income equals -$20, and it pays no taxes. The aggregate tax
rate, computed by adding together the taxes of both firms and dividing by the

sum of their profits, is 19.2 percent (25/130). The aggregate profit rate is
6.5 percent (130/2000). Now consider what happens if the second firm's profit
rate rises to 5 percent. Its taxable income is now exactly zero but it still
pays no taxes, so the aggregate average tax rate is 16.7 percent (25/150),

down from 19.2 percent. The aggregate profit rate rises to 7.5 percent,
illustrating the possibility of a negative relationship between profitability
and the aggregate average tax rate.
The sensitivity of average tax rates to economic conditions is only one

of their many shortcomings as a measure of corporate tax burdens. It is well
known (see Auerbach (1983) or Fullerton (1984)) that average tax rates may
provide little information on the pattern of marginal tax incentives facing

new investments. In addition, aggregate average tax rates may conceal
important differences in tax burdens across different assets and different

-10-

by banks that invest in municipal debt, as part of the total tax burden.

Likewise, many sources of true economic income are ignored, since certain

accounting practices that misstate economic income are not corrected. This
problem even applies to the National Income Accounts. An example of such a
misstatement is the inappropriate timing of expenses under the completed

contract accounting method. Accounting differences accentuate the problem of
comparing average tax rates across industries.

3.

Why Have Average Tax Rates Declined?

The last section demonstrated that declining profits and declining
average tax rates are jointly responsible for the dramatic fall in corporate

taxes. Despite numerous shortcomings, average tax rates do prove useful in
analyzing changes in corporate tax revenues. They have also played an
important part in the recent corporate tax reform debate. This section
therefore extends our previous analysis by investigating the proximate causes

of declining average tax rates. The source of recent changes in corporate
profitability constitutes an unresolved puzzle which is beyond the scope of
the current paper.2

3.1 Statutory Tax Rates versus Average Tax Rates
Movements in average tax rates may be traced to changes in capital
recovery provisions, the increased prevalence of firms with tax losses,

increased use of investment tax credits, and other factors. Each of these
factors causes the average tax rate to differ from the statutory maximum rate,

—11—

as shown in Table 3. The first column in Table 3 shows the maximum statutory
tax rate for each year from 1959 to 1985. The entries in the six middle
columns describe how various factors have caused the average tax rate to

differ from the statutory rate. Negative entries indicate factors that caused
the average tax rate to be less than the statutory rate, while positive
entries correspond to factors that increased the tax burden above the

statutory rate. The average tax rate, TAXES/PROFITS, is reported in the last
column. It it the sum of the maximum statutory tax rate plus the six
adjustment factors in the middle columns. A detailed description of our
methodology for decomposing the average tax rate is provided in the appendix.

The first source of differences between statutory and average tax rates
is increasingly-generous capital recovery, as shown in the second column of

Table 3. This term includes both the tax reduction from use of the investment
tax credit, as well as that due to differences between tax depreciation and

true economic depreciation. During the most recent five year period, capital
recovery provisions accounted for a 22 percent differential between the

statutory and the average tax rate. This is a substantial increase from the
late 1970s, when these provisions explained a 9.5 percent difference between
the two tax rates, or the 1960s, when these factors reduced the average tax

rate by 8.9 percent. Because generous capital recovery provisions have been
one of the popular villains behind the recent decline in corporate taxes, we
shall return below to provide a more detailed breakdown of these effects.

The third column in Table 3 reports the effect of inflation on average

tax rates. This column combines two separate influences. First, inflation
leads to spurious inventory profits that raise corporate tax payments and the

A detailed description of these calculations is presented in the appendix.
All entries for 1984 and 1985 are based on preliminary data and extrapolations. The average tax rate (column 8) equals the statutory rate (column
1) plus the adjustment factors in columns 2-7.

—12-

average tax rate. (Inflation's positive impact through a related channel, the
failure to index depreciation allowances for inflation, is subsumed in the

capital recovery term above). Inflation also exerts a countervailing effect
on the average tax rate by reducing the real value of corporate debt,

generating capital gains for equity holders. These gains are untaxed, so
inflation raises economic income but does not affect taxes. The two effects
roughly cancel, resulting in a small net effect of inflation on the average

tax rate. Inflation raised the average tax rate by less than 1 percent during
the 1970s, and it has reduced the average tax rate by 3.5 percent during the
1980s.

The fourth column in Table 3 indicates the impact of imperfect

loss-offset provisions on the average tax rate. The principal effect of
imperfect loss offset is to raise the average tax rate when firms experience

losses, since firms with negative income cannot claim tax refunds. Tax
receipts are therefore higher than they would be in a system with proportional

taxation of economic income. This effect is somewhat attenuated by the
availability of loss carrybacks and net operating loss carryforwards.

Carrybacks allow some loss offset in the year when losses occur. Loss
carryforwards, in contrast, reduce a firm's current tax liability as a result
of previous losses.
Imperfect loss offset provisions may raise or lower the average tax rate,

depending on whether net operating loss deductions exceed the value of losses

not carried back. The entries in column four of Table 3 shows that throughout
the 1959-1985 period imperfect loss offsets generated a substantial net

increase in the average tax rate. For the most recent five years, the

—13-

provisions regarding losses increased the average tax rate by 11.8 percent.
This is much larger than the impact of losses in any previous period.

Imperfect loss offsets accounted for a 4.4 percent increase in the average tax

rate in the 1970s, and a 3.2 percent increase during the 1960s. This result
deserves emphasis: the increased incidence of tax losses during the 1980s has
increased, not reduced, the average corporate tax rate.

The fifth column of Table 3 describes how foreign tax provisions affect

the average tax rate. This term consists of two parts. The first measures
the increase in taxes that would have resulted if foreign source income were
taxable at the U.S. statutory rate, while the second reduces taxes by the

amount of foreign tax credits claimed. If the statutory tax rates in all
other countries equalled that in the United States and all firms could utilize
foreign tax credits in full, then the net foreign tax effect in our table

would equal zero. If foreign countries levied taxes at rates below the
domestic rate, the foreign tax effect would be positive since the domestic

taxes on foreign source income would exceed the foreign tax credit. In our
data, the net effect of foreign tax provisions is a small increase in the

average tax rate. This effect averages 0.4 percent in the last five years,
compared with 0.45 percent during the 1970s and 1960s.
The sixth and seventh columns of Table 3 indicate the influence of two
other factors, tax progressivity and an "other" category which includes posttabulation revisions and miscellaneous tax credits, on the average tax rate.

Neither factor has a large effect. Tax progressivity, which accounts for the
fact that some corporate income is taxed at rates below the statutory maximum,

lowers the average tax rate by roughly 3.5 percent with little variation over

—14-

time. The "other" category usually raises the average corporate tax rate,
since the results of tax audits are included in this category and they
outweigh the other tax credits.

Table 3 clearly suggests that the most important factor causing average
tax rates to fall below the statutory rate are capital recovery provisions.

For the last five years, capital recovery provisions depressed the average tax
rate by 14 percent more than they did during the 1960s and by 13 percent more

than during the late 1970s. We now consider a more detailed breakdown of
changes in capital recovery provisions.

3.2 Changes in Capital Recovery Provisions
The capital recovery variable in Table 3 has two parts: one due to the
capital consumption adjustment, and the other due to the investment tax

credit. The capital consumption adjustment is the difference between tax
depreciation and real economic depreciation. It has two components:
Accelerated Depreciation, and Basis Misstatement. Accelerated Depreciation is
the difference between tax depreciation and economic depreciation at historic

cost. Tax depreciation is based on tax service lives and depreciation
schedules. It usually provides larger depreciation allowances than would
application of realistic economic lifetimes and decay patterns to the historic

costs of corporate assets. Taxable income therefore understates economic
income, reducing the average tax rate. The second term, Basis Misstatement,
measures the difference between straight—line depreciation using economic
asset lives but historic asset costs and that using the same decay profiles

but revaluing assets each year to their current replacement cost. Failure to

—15—

index the basis of depreciable assets raises taxable income above economic
income and therefore increases the average tax rate.

The data in Table 4 show the relative importance of the three parts of

the capital recovery aggregate. During the last five years, accelerated
depreciation reduced the average tax rate by 35 percent, the ITC lowered -it

13 percent, and inflationary misstatement of asset basis raised it by

26 percent. These large offsetting effects correspond to the net effect of
-22

percent that is reported in the third column of Table 3. All three

factors have become larger in absolute value during our sample period. In the
1960s, for example, accelerated depreciation lowered the average rate by
11.9 percent, inflation effects raised it by 5.4 percent, and the ITC lowered
it by another 2.3 percent.

These results naturally raise the question of whether movements in the
capital recovery factor are primarily the result of legislative changes, or
whether they have been caused by other forces such as a shift in the

composition of investment toward equipment rather than structures. Although
separating average tax rate movements into components due to legislative and
other changes is a treacherous exercise, some illustrative calculations are

nonetheless possible. Ziemer (1985) estimates the change in federal corporate
tax revenues due to the passage of ERTA and TEFRA, and presents a separate
calculation for the impact of accelerated depreciation and other provisions.
Using his revenue estimates, we calculate that the average tax rate would have
been about 7 percent higher during the last four years if ACRS had not been

adopted. This corresponds to increased revenues of $20 billion per year, on
average, since 1982. The effect would have been largest in 1985, the year

with the largest stock of assets receiving generous ACRS depreciation.
Although ACRS has lowered corporate taxes in the past four years,
focusing only on the immediate post-enactment effects of tax legislation can

be misleading. Passage of a bill such as the Economic Recovery Tax Act
depresses corporate taxes by more in the period immediately after enactment

than it does in the steady state. Immediately after enactment, revenues are
reduced both because new assets are given substantial depreciation benefits
immediately after installation, and because some relatively old pre-reform

assets are still eligible for depreciation benefits under the prior, less

generous depreciation rules. In the steady state, only the generous
depreciation for new assets reduces revenues. This partially explains why,
even without the 1986 Tax Reform Act, corporate tax revenues were expected to

rise during the late 1980s. An opposite effect arises with the recent
legislation, which lengthens asset lives. It will collect more revenue in the
short run than in the steady state, because some aging pre—TRA assets are
paying higher taxes than they would had they been depreciated under the new
rules.

4.

Corporate Taxes Under the 1986 Tax Reform Act

The recently enacted Tax Reform Act of 1986 shifts $120 billion of
federal tax liability from households to corporations over the 1987—1991

period. The IRA will therefore affect both the average tax rate and the
tax-to-asset ratio for nonfinancial corporations. This section uses revenue
projections from the Congressional Budget Office (1986) to estimate the course

—17—

of average tax rates over the next five years. It compares the tax trajectory
without the Tax Reform Act with

the trajectory under the new legislation, and

places the increased corporate tax burden in historical perspective.

Table 5 compares the paths of corporate tax payments under old law and

the Tax Reform Act of 1986. A detailed description of the calculations is
provided in the appendix. The first panel shows the level of corporate tax
payments by NFC5 in 1986 dollars under the two regimes. Even under old law,
corporate taxes are projected to rise. By 1990, for example, they will be
77 percent higher than in the first five years of the 1980s. Rising corporate
tax payments can be traced to two sources. First, corporate profits are
forecast to rise in the late 1980s. Our CBO-based projections imply a profit
rate of 8.2 percent for the period 1987-1991, compared with 4.9 percent in the

early 1980s. In addition, the front-loading of depreciation under ACRS
implies that the average tax rate on projects undertaken since 1981 is low

early in the project's life and high later on. As more projects reach the
high-tax stage of their life cycle, corporate taxes also rise.

Under the Tax Reform Act, revenues rise even more rapidly than under old

law. By 1990 corporate taxes from the NFCs exceed $100 billion (1986
dollars), more than double the level of the past five years. For the
1987-1991 period, corporate taxes are 22 percent greater under the IRA than

under current law. The new bill's revenue impact is largest in 1987, when it
raises over 30 percent more revenue than the current law. This is because
rates remain high, but most tax preferences have been eliminated.

The two lower panels of Table 5 show corporate taxes relative to GNP and

corporate assets. Under current law the tax-to-GNP ratio would rise from

1.2 percent in 1985 to 1.8 percent in 1991, while the Tax Reform Act raises

this ratio to 2.2 percent. The new law therefore returns the tax-to-GNP ratio
to its level during the late 1970s, but not to the level (3.2 percent on

average) of the 1960s. A similar statement applies to the ratio of tax
payments to net NFC assets, which is plotted in Figure 1. From an average of
1.5 percent in the 1981-85 period, this tax measure rises to 2.6 percent under

old law and to 3.1 percent under new law by 1991. The new law will double the
ratio of taxes to corporate assets, although this ratio will still be lower
than it was during the 1960s.

Although part of the change in tax revenues is due to anticipated
increases in corporate profits, the average tax rate will also change

significantly during the next five years. This is shown in the first two rows
of Table 6, which report the average tax rates under old law and under the Tax

Reform Act for the 1986—1991 period. Without any legislative change, the
average tax rate would have increased from 0.24 in 1985 to 0.30 by 1990. This
is higher than in the first five years of the 1980s, but still below the level

of the late 1970s. Under new law, by comparison, the average tax rate rises
to 0.36 by the end of the decade, almost returning to its level of the late

1970s. The Tax Reform Act has its largest impact on the tax rate in the
transition period, 1987 and 1988, when the ratio of taxes to economic profits

rises by 8.1 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. Figure 2 plots the
movements in average tax rates both for the 1959-1985 period as well as for
the next five years under both old and new law.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changes numerous provisions in the corporate

income tax. The Joint Tax Committee's revenue estimates, for example, include

seventeen major categories, and hundreds of minor categories, through which

revenue changes occur. A detailed analysis of why the average tax rate will
differ from the statutory rate is impossible because many of the required data

series are unavailable. We can, however, provide a rough sketch of why the
average tax rate changes under the new law.

The last four rows in Table 6 disaggregate changes in the effective tax

rate between old law and the Tax Reform Act into four categories. The first,
the change in the statutory rate, reduces the average rate. There are no rate
changes for 1986. In 1987, the statutory rate falls by 6 percent to the
40 percent "blended" rate for a company whose fiscal year coincides with the

calendar year. Beginning in calendar 1988, the top statutory rate is
34 percent.

Several provisions offset the statutory rate reduction and raise the

average tax rate. The next row shows the impact of changes in capital
recovery provisions, principally the repeal of the Investment Tax Credit and

the extension of tax depreciation lives. This accounts for an 11 percent
increase in the average tax rate in 1991. In the earlier years it is somewhat
less important, principally because transition rules allow a substantial share
of the investment undertaken prior to 1988 to obtain favorable tax
treatment .5

The penultimate row in Table 6 shows how changes in accounting rules

affect the average tax rate. There are a number of important provisions in
this category, including changes affecting long-term contracts, the
capitalization of construction and development costs, and the treatment of

capital gains on installment obligations. These accounting changes raise the

-20—

average tax rate by nearly 5 percent in 1988, and by an average of 3.8 percent

during the 1987-1991 period.6 The final row of Table 6 shows how various
other factors cause the average tax rate under the new law to differ from that

under previous law. These provisions include the strengthened minimum tax,
changes in foreign tax credit provisions, and revenues from increased tax

compliance. These miscellaneous provisions increase the average tax rate by
4.4 percent in 1991.

Although our calculations of the factors behind changes in average tax
rates are necessarily uncertain, they do underscore two important features of

the 1985 Tax Reform Act. First, changes in capital recovery provisions will
significantly raise corporate taxes. By the late 1980s, the differential
between the statutory and the average tax rate that will be attributable to

capital recovery rules will return to its level in the 1960s and 1970s. The
Tax Reform Act therefore reverses the changes of the early 1980s, when the
combination of accelerated depreciation and investment credits lowered average

tax rates by as much as 25 percent. Second, many of the important
revenue-raising provisions in the new law are excluded from the usual economic

analysis of corporate tax incentives. Marginal effective tax rate
calculations, such as those in King and Fullerton (1984), do not usually
incorporate particular accounting rules, minimum taxes, or many of the other
provisions that have an important effect on corporate investment incentives.

5. Conclusions

This paper explores why corporate tax revenues have declined for the last

thirty years. Contrary to many claims, legislative changes explain less than
half of the decline in revenues since the mid-1960s.

The decline in

corporate profits, which averaged nearly 11 percent of the value of net
corporate assets during the 1960s as compared with just under 5 percent in the
1980s, is a more important factor.

Declining corporate tax revenues have been accompanied by a decline in the

average tax rate, the ratio of corporate taxes to economic profits. While
this average tax rate is of limited value for analyzing the incentive effects
of the corporate tax, it has attracted widespread attention in the recent tax

reform discussion. Changes in both the tax law and the rate of corporate
profits affect the average tax rate. The change in depreciation provisions
between the late 1970s and the early 1980s reduced the average tax rate by
roughly 13 percent.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which raises $120 billion in corporate taxes
over the next five years, accelerates the trend toward rising average tax

rates that would have occurred under old law. Reduced capital recovery
allowances and other changes in the 1986 Act will combine to raise average
effective tax rates to 36 percent by 1990, compared with 31 percent in the

first five years of the 1980s. Corporate taxes as a share of GNP and relative
to corporate assets will also rise significantly. By 1990, federal tax
payments will equal 3 percent of net corporate assets, well above their level
in the early 1980s and approximately equal to their asset share in the late

—22—

1970s. Taxes will still remain a smaller fraction of assets than they were in
the 19605, however, in part because corporate profitability is projected to be

well below its level two decades ago. Although we focus on the Tax Reform
Act's revenue impact over the next five years, this is a potentially

misleading indicator of a tax bill's revenue effects. By lengthening the
depreciation lives of many assets, the new law raises corporate tax revenues

in the short run at the expense of some reduction in future years. The
inherent uncertainty in long-range forecasts, however, makes it difficult to
quantify these effects.

Much of our analysis implicitly divorces the average tax rate from the
corporate profit rate, although such a separation is in fact impossible.

Because corporate taxes do not rise proportionally with corporate profits,
changes in the profit rate have a direct influence on the average tax rate.
Over longer horizons, the average tax rate may also affect the profit rate, at

least if average and marginal tax rates move in tandem. Higher tax burdens
will induce offsetting reductions in capital investment which should increase
pretax profitability.

Finally, our analysis of revenue changes in the 1986 Tax Reform Act
suggests that a wide range of corporate tax provisions which have important
revenue effects are typically ignored in the economic analysis of the

corporate income tax. These provisions affect both the average and marginal
tax rates on new investment, and deserve to be incorporated in future work.

Footnotes

Alternative views of what constitutes the corporate tax base are also
1.
possible. Feldstein and Summers (1979) and Feldstein, Dicks-Mireaux, and
Poterba (1983) consider the total earnings of the corporate sector, including
those paid to debt-holders, as the tax base. Because interest payments are
taxed less heavily than equity earnings, measuring the average tax rate
relative to this base would lower the average tax rate but not affect its
decline over time. The profit rate associated with this concept of corporate
profits has also declined significantly during our sample period.
2.
Since we are concerned primarily with the impact of legislative changes
on tax receipts, we focus on the role of tax reforms in altering the average
tax rate. Although tax changes may also affect revenues by altering profits,
this effect is likely to be small over the time horizons we consider.

Our calculations may overstate the importance of capital recovery
provisions in lowering the average tax rate, because we assume that all
changes in the difference between tax and economic depreciation were actually
claimed by firms. For firms which are carrying losses forward, this will
overstate the importance of depreciation provisions, and overstate the
importance of losses as well.
3.

Although revenues will be lower immediately after a tax reform like ERTA
than in the steady state, it does not follow that tax revenues two years after
the reform are higher than those in the year after the reform. There is a
countervailing revenue—reducing effect: as the stock of assets being
depreciated under the generous new rules rises, tax receipts may decline.
4.

Our measure of the average tax rate change due to capital recovery may
understate the actual impact of the new law because of the interaction between
depreciation provisions and the strengthened minimum tax. For firms with
substantial depreciation deductions, the new minimum tax may raise tax
payments. This is classified as an effect of the minimum tax, not
depreciation rules, in our analysis.
5.

6. An important caveat applies to the accounting-induced change in average
tax rates. Table 6 reports the accounting-induced change in taxes divided by
our measure of economic income. Each accounting change, however, also affects
the measured value of economic income. Repeal of the completed contract
method of accounting, for example, will change the IRS measure of receipts
less deductions that forms the basis for our profits variable. Average tax
rates computed relative to measured economic income under the new tax regime,
therefore, would be slightly lower than those reported here since income will
be higher as a result of these accounting changes. Average tax rates in all
previous years, computed relative to an economic income measure which did not
allow for deferred accrual under the completed contract method, would be lower
than those reported in Tables 2 and 3. The change in average rates over time
is not affected by the choice of convention for economic income, even though
the level of the average rate is.

Technical Appendix
Description of the Average Tax Rate Decomposition and Data Sources

This appendix explains how we allocate changes in the average tax rate
into various components, describes our measures of tax payments and economic
income for nonfinancial corporations, and presents a detailed account of our
post-1986 projections.

The Average Tax Rate Decomposition
-

Our average tax rate decomposition begins from the definition of federal
tax receipts from the NFCs:

(Al)

TAXES = T*A*ISTT - CBACKS - ITC

ISTT denotes income subject to tax, T

is

-

FTC - OTHCRED + RETAB.

the maximum statutory corporate tax

rate, and A is a "progressivity parameter" reflecting the fact that not all

taxable income is taxed at the top marginal rate. All the terms on the
right-hand side of (Al) are directly available, except for A. We estimate A
using data from the Statistics of Income Sourcebook as A = TAXBEFCRED/(T*ISTT),

where TAXBEFCRED is taxes payable before computation of credits. Investment
tax credits (ITC), foreign tax credits (FTC), other credits (OTHCRED), and
CBACKS (loss carrybacks) reduce corporate tax receipts. RETAB, which
corresponds to the results of IRS audits and other changes in prior returns,

is typically positive and therefore raises revenue. Note that our measures of
tax credits correspond to actual, not potential, credits; limits on the use of
tax credits may induce substantial differences between the two in recent years
(see Altshuler and Auerbach (1986) for a discussion).

—27-

While taxes are levied on income subject to tax, average tax rates are
calculated relative to the real economic income of shareholders, denoted by

PROFITS. Income subject to tax and economic income are related by the
identity:

(A2)

PROFITS = ISTT + NTI + NOL + CCADJ + IVA + DEBTGAIN

-

FSI

where NTI is the net income of firms with current losses and zero taxable
income, NOL is the statutory deduction for net operating losses incurred in
previous years, CCADJ is the National Income Accounts capital consumption
adjustment that is the difference between tax and economic depreciation, IVA
is the inventory valuation adjustment (again from NIPA) that measures the
spurious profits which result from inflation on goods in inventory, DEBTGAIN
is the transfer from bondholders to equity—holders that takes place when
inflation reduces the value of outstanding debt, and FSI is the foreign source

income of U.S. corporations. A very helpful reference for understanding the
relationship between IRS and National Income Accounts measures of corporate
profits is the U.S. Department of Commerce (1985).

Equations (Al) and (A2) can be combined to obtain an expression for tax

receipts in terms of economic income. Dividing through this expression by
economic income yields:
(A3) TAXES/PROFITS = T*A -

r*A*(NTI

(ITC + FTC +

+ NOL

+ CCADJ + IVA + DEBTGAIN - FSI)/PROFITS

OTHCRED + CBACKS)/PROFITS +

We rewrite this expression by grouping together related terms:

RETAB/PROFITS.

-28-

(A4) TAXES/PROFITS = T - (T*A*CCAOJ + ITC)/PROFITS - T*A*(IVA+DEBTGAIN)/PROFITS
-

(T*X*[NOL +

+

T(A-1)

-

Nil]

+ CBACKS)/PROFITS -

(OTHCRED +

(FTC - T*A*FSI)/PROFITS

RETAB)/PROFITS.

The first term on the right-hand side of (A4) is the maximum statutory tax

rate. The six adjustments to the statutory rate that are required to obtain
the average tax rate correspond to the entries in Table 3.

The first adjustment involves capital recovery provisions. It is the sum
of investment tax credits and CCAOJ, the difference between tax depreciation

and economic depreciation of corporate assets at replacement cost. The
National Income Accounts also disaggregate the CCADJ into the components due
to accelerated depreciation at historic cost and inflationary misstatement of
basis; this breakdown is used in our Table 4.

The next adjustment term corresponds to the other distortions of profits

related to inflation. It includes the inventory valuation adjustment and the
inflation-induced gain on corporate debt. NIPA convention defines IVA as a
negative quantity; the average tax rate is therefore increasing in the IVA,

which in turn is an increasing function of infTation. DEBTGAIN is positive,
however, and reduces the average tax rate during periods of high inflation.

This is because the inflation-induced gains of the equity holders are not part

of the tax base, so they yield income but no tax liability. The net effect of
these two factors depends upon the level of leverage and the stock of
inventories held in the corporate sector.

The third adjustment term concerns corporate losses, and Consists of

three parts. The first is the net income of firms with zero taxable income,

-29-

the second adds net operating loss deductions back into taxable income, and
the third adjusts for the use of current losses to obtain carryback refunds.

Again there are countervailing effects. Higher levels of both NOL deductions
and carryback refunds reduce the average corporate tax rate relative to what

it vould be in a system which taxed current economic income. Increases in the
losses accruing to currently non-taxable firms, however, raise the average tax
rate.

(NTI is a negative number, so that an "increase in losses" is in fact a

reduction of NTI, although an increase in its absolute value.) Losses raise
the average tax rate because economic income is computed by netting the income

of firms with positive profits against the income of firms with losses. For
tax purposes, however, this offset does not take place. Firms with positive
profits pay taxes while those with negative earnings receive nothing.
Imperfect loss offset provisions therefore cause losses to raise the average
tax rate.

The fourth adjustment to the statutory rate involves foreign income and

tax credits. The adjustment term equals the tax liability that would have
been due on foreign source income if it had been earned in the United States,

minus foreign tax credits claimed. Since foreign tax credits are subject to a
variety of limitations, the net effect of these two factors is usually to raise

average tax rates. Our treatment of foreign source income also induces a
potential relationship between foreign tax rates and the measured average tax

rate on domestic income. For example, income earned in a country with a
corporate tax rate below A*'r will face additional tax when repatriated to a

U.S. firm. This will raise our measured average tax rate on domestic income.
Such effects are inevitable in any calculation such as ours that considers the

-30-

domestic tax rate in one nation rather than the worldwide tax rate on
worldwide income.

The two remaining adjustments are straightforward. The fifth, for the
progressivity of the tax code, measures the change in the average tax rate due

to taxing some positive-income firms at rates below the statutory maximum. It
always reduces the average tax rate, since about 1O of the positive taxable
income accruing to corporations is taxed at rates below the statutory maximum.

The final term combines other tax credits with retabulations, Other tax
credits are important primarily in recent years, when they include the R&D Tax
Credit, the New Jobs Credit, and various energy-related credits.

Retabulations Consist primarily of audit profits and minor adjustments to tax
returns filed in previous years.

Data Sources
Most of the data series used in our analysis are drawn from either the
National Income and Product Accounts, supplemented by unpublished NIPA data,

or the IRS Corporation Sourcebook of Statistics of Income. In some cases the
data series for 1984 and 1985 are based on preliminary data or have been
constructed by extrapolating 1983 values.
The National Income and Product Accounts present data on federal

corporate profits tax liability for the entire corporate sector, but not for
the NFCs. (NIPA also presents total tax liabilities to all governments,

divided into financial and nonfinancial sectors). We construct our own
estimate of NFC federal taxes following the NIPA approach for all corporations

as in NIPA Table 8.13. Our tax measure is:

—31-

TAXES = Income Taxes Before Credits (SOl) - Tax Credits (SOl)

(A5)

-

Carryback Refunds (NIPA) + Other Retabulations (NIPA)

The first two variables are drawn from Statistics of Income for the years

1959—1983. Our sample period begins in 1959 because that is when the IRS
began publishing information on Income Subject to Tax, one of the variables

used in constructing corporate profits. We construct a measure for the
nonfinancial corporate sector as All Returns - Finance Insurance and Real
Estate +

Insurance Agents + Real Estate Operators. This is not exactly

coincident with the NIPA definition, which also includes some holding
companies that cannot be separately identified from the SOI data, but the

differences between the two series are trivial. Carrybacks and other
retabulations are drawn from unpublished data used to construct NIPA Table

8.13. Our data on these series are for the entire corporate sector, because a
breakdown for financial versus nonfinancial firms is not available. The
errors associated with the inclusion of financial firms in these aggregates
are also likely to be small.

For 1984 and 1985 our measures of tax credits are based on forecasts

provided by the Joint Tax Committee. We extrapolated Income Taxes Before
Credits by extrapolating total taxes, using NIPA data on NFC tax liability to
all levels of government, and then adjusting it for the credit terms on the

right—hand side. We obtained data on the sum of carrybacks and retabulations
from the preliminary National Income and Product Accounts, and assumed
carrybacks remained constant at their 1983 level to divide the series into its
two components.
We define real economic profits of the nonfinancial corporate sector as:

-32-

(A6) PROFITS = Income Subject to Tax (SOl) + Net Operating Loss Deductions (SOl)

+

Negative Taxable Income (SOl) +

+ DEBTGAIN

-

CCADJ (NIPA) +

IVA (NIPA)

FSI

The data series for Income Subject to Tax and NOL Deductions are drawn from

Statistics of Income. IVA is reported in the NIPA, in Table 1.16. The
measurement of NTI, CCADJ, DEBTGAIN, and FSI require discussion.
NTI is the net income of firms with zero taxable income.

It is computed

as the difference between the entries for Net Income in the Sourcebook tables
for (i) Firms With and Without Net Income, and (ii) Firms With Net Income.
NTI -is this difference minus the net income differential for Subchapter S

corporations and the Special Statutory Deductions for firms with no taxable
income.

Although a measure of CCADJ is reported in the National Income Accounts,
we amend -it slightly for our analysis. We augment the NIPA measure of CCADJ
(Table 8.4) with the depletion adjustment for domestic minerals and the
adjustment to depreciate expenditures for oil shafts, wells, and exploration

from NIPA Table 8.12. These are additional cases in which tax depreciation
differs from economic depreciation, so these terms must be added to the
accelerated depreciation component of CCADJ.

DEBTGAIN is defined as the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter percentage
change in the GNP deflator, times the market value of outstanding NFC debt at

the end of the previous year. The time series for debt at market value is
described in Feldstein and Jung (1986).

FSI is measured as foreign service taxable income less loss (before

-33-

recapture) as reported in various issues of the Statistics of Income Bulletin.
This corresponds to current taxable income from foreign sources.
Unfortunately, this data series is not available for every year since 1959;

rather, it is available for 14 of the years between 1961 and 1982. We
interpolated and extrapolated these data to other years when necessary. In
1979, the dramatic decline in the net foreign tax effect on the average tax
rate may be due to some error induced by our interpolation procedure.

Our measure of economic profits differs from that in the National Income

Accounts in several ways. The most important is its inclusion of the
equity—holders capital gain on corporate debt during inflationary periods. In
addition, the National Income Accounts include net foreign source equity

income of all U.S. residents in the measured corporate profits. We also
include the 15 of intercorporate dividends not exempt from taxation, because
the data required to remove this component of IRS taxable income were not
available prior to 1978.

All of the series based on NIPA data were available through 1985, with
the exception of the depletion and oil exploration adjustments which were

available through 1983. We constructed 1984 and 1985 values for these series
as well as the NOL and NTI series from the IRS by assuming they remained

constant at their real 1983 levels. We assumed A remained constant at its
1983 value, and updated ISTT as ISTT =

TAXBEFCRED/T*X using our TAXBEFCRED

forecast.

Finally, we measured the current replacement cost of the net tangible
assets held in the nonfinancial corporate sector using the Federal Reserve

Board's Balance Sheets of the U.S.Economy. The Balance Sheets report year—end

-34-

values, which we averaged to construct the mid-year value for the denominator
of our profit rate calculations. We subtract the Feldsteiri-Jun (1986)
measure of the market value of corporate debt to obtain a series for the net
assets of the corporate sector.

Revenue and Average Tax Rate Projections, 1986-1991
Most of our calculations for the 1986—1991 period rely on data from the

Congressional Budget Office (1986). We use their GNP projections and
inflation forecasts for the GNP deflator throughout our calculation.

Our profit variable, PROFITS, has two components. One corresponds loosely
to real economic profits in the NIPA, the other is OEBTGAIN. To calculate the
PROFITS components other than DEBTGAIN, we use the CBO forecast of real

corporate profits on a NIPA basis, PROFITSNIPA. We compute the ratio (PROFITS
— DEBTGAIN)/PR0FITSNIPA for 1984 and 1985; the ratios are .747 and .703,

respectively. Using an average ratio of .725, we forecast (PROFITS DEBTGAIN) based on the CBO forecasts and then add in DEBTGAIN, calculated as

the CBO inflation rate times our extrapolation of corporate debt (which is the
1985 value extrapolated at the nominal GNP growth rate).
We compute NFC tax liabilities under old law using the CBO's forecasts of
fiscal year corporate tax receipts (p.63), less projected receipts from
Federal Reserve Banks (taken from the 0MB Federal Budget projections for
Fiscal 1987 and years through 1989, with extrapolation through 1991 holding

the series constant in real terms). This tax measure is a fiscal year
indicator of accruals from the whole corporate sector. We use the ratio of
NFC to total federal taxes in 1985 (.885) to scale this profit measure for the

—35—

NFCs, and then convert to calendar years by averaging adjacent fiscal years

with weights of .75 and .25, respectively. When projections for FY 1992 were
needed, we assumed that the fiscal 1991 value grew at the same rate as between
FY 1990 and 1991.

Total federal revenues for fiscal years through 1991 are reported in the

CBO (p.63). We calculated calendar year revenues as a weighted average, and
found the calendar 1991 value by increasing the calendar 1990 value in the
same proportion as the fiscal 1991 revenue forecast relative to the fiscal

1990 forecast. We extrapolated the net replacement value of NFC assets
assuming they grew in real terms at 1.64% per year, the average growth rate
for the years 1980 through 1985, and fully reflected inflation in the GNP
deflator.

Finally, to measure the revenue changes associated with the 1986 Tax
Reform Act, we rely upon the Joint Tax Committee's revenue estimates presented

in House of Representatives (1986). We estimate the total tax effect for
nonfinancial corporations as the total change in corporate revenues, less the
changes due to taxation of insurance companies and financial institutions
(titles IX and X of the revenue estimates), less .115 times the revenue
changes for the minimum tax, pension provisions, compliance, and miscellaneous

other provisions (titles VII, XI, XV, and XVII). This correction adjusts for
the share of these revenue changes which arise from the financial

corporations. We adjust all revenue estimates from fiscal to calendar years
using weighted averages, and construct fiscal 1992 estimates assuming the
fiscal 1991 value grows at the same rate as it did between fiscal 1990 and

fiscal 1991. Our measure of capital recovery changes is just the revenue

-36--

change due to title II, capital cost provisions, and that for accounting
reforms is the revenue estimate in title VIII.
