    "abstract": "\n\nWhen regulated firms are offered compensation to prevent them from relocating, efficiency requires that payments be distributed across firms so as to equalize marginal relocation probabilities, weighted by the damage caused by relocation. We formalize this fundamental economic logic and apply it to analyzing compensation rules proposed under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, where emission permits are allocated free of charge to carbon intensive and trade exposed industries. We show that this practice results in substantial overcompensation for given carbon leakage risk. Efficient permit allocation reduces the aggregate risk of job loss by more than half without increasing aggregate compensation.\n\n",

Melanie Hermann and Antonin Cura provided excellent research assistance. The constructive and insightful comments by two anonymous referees, by the editor, and by Mark Jacobsen have led to a much improved paper. We have received helpful comments from Stephen Boucher, Alex Bowen, Jonathan Colmer, Denny Ellerman, Sam Fankhauser, Tom Foxon, Andy Gouldson, St\u00e9phanie Monjon, John Van Reenen and from staff members at DECC, at DG Climate, and at the Environmental Committee of the European Parliament. We thank conference participants at A Toxa 2012, EEA 2011, NBER Summer Institute 2012, RES 2012, SURED 2012, WCERE 2010, and seminar audiences at Carlos III, D\u00fcsseldorf Institute for Competition Economics, Kiel University, LSE, M\u00fcnster University, the Paris Environmental and Energy Economics Seminar and RWTH Aachen for their feedback.

Together with Ralf Martin and Ulrich Wagner, I was hired in 2012 by the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change to write a literature review of the EU ETS which is available at:  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48449/5725-an-evidence-review-of-the-eu-emissions-trading-sys.pdf.\nFurthermore, Martin, Wagner and I received a grant (2012-2014) from the ESRC (#ES/J006742/1) to conduct an ex-post evaluation of the EU ETS.\n\n\nFrom 2011-2013, I have received a postdoctoral early career fellowship from the Leverhulme Trust to conduct research on the impact of climate and climate policies on firms. I am also part of two research consortia funded by the European Commission FP7 program. Within the Social Impact Policy Analysis of Technological Innovation Challenges (SIMPATIC) consortium I am studying the characteristics of \u201cclean\u201d innovation and the implications of climate change policies for growth.  Within the ENTRACTE consortium I am conducting and econometric ex-post evaluation of the EU ETS.\n\n\nNone of these interested parties have requested to review the results of the study prior to their dissemination.\n\n\n\nLaure B. de Preux\n\nThe interviews were funded through grants from the European Climate Foundation and the Economic and Social Research Council.
