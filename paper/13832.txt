Social Learning and Peer Effects in Consumption: Evidence from Movie Sales
Enrico Moretti
NBER Working Paper No. 13832
March 2008
JEL No. J0,L15
ABSTRACT
Using box-office data for all movies released between 1982 and 2000, I test the implications of a simple
model of social learning in which the consumption decisions of individuals depend on information
they receive from their peers. The model predicts different box office sales dynamics depending on
whether opening weekend demand is higher or lower than expected. I use a unique feature of the movie
industry to identify ex-ante demand expectations: the number of screens dedicated to a movie in its
opening weekend reflects the sales expectations held by profit-maximizing theater owners. Several
pieces of evidence are consistent with social learning. First, sales of movies with positive surprise
and negative surprise in opening weekend demand diverge over time. If a movie has better than expected
appeal and therefore experiences larger than expected sales in week 1, consumers in week 2 update
upward their expectations of quality, further increasing week 2 sales. Second, this divergence is small
for movies for which consumers have strong priors and large for movies for which consumers have
weak priors. Third, the effect of a surprise is stronger for audiences with large social networks. Finally,
consumers do not respond to surprises in first week sales that are orthogonal to movie quality, like
weather shocks. Overall, social learning appears to be an important determinant of sales in the movie
industry, accounting for 38% of sales for the typical movie with positive surprise. This implies the
existence of a large "social multiplier'' such that the elasticity of aggregate demand to movie quality
is larger than the elasticity of individual demand to movie quality.

Introduction

The goal of this paper is to test whether the consumption decisions of individuals depend
on information they receive from their peers when product quality is difficult to observe
in advance. I focus on situations where quality is ex-ante uncertain and consumers hold
a prior on quality, which they may update based on information from their peers. This
information may come from direct communication with peers who have already consumed
the good. Alternatively, it may arise from the observation of peers’ purchasing decisions.
If every individual receives an independent signal of the goods quality, then the purchasing
decision of one consumer provides valuable information to other consumers, as individuals
use the information contained in others’ actions to update their own expectations on quality.
This type of social learning is potentially relevant for many experience goods like movies,
books, restaurants, or legal services. Informational cascades are particularly important for
new products. For the first few years of its existence, Google experienced exponential acceleration in market share. This acceleration, which displayed hallmarks of contagion dynamics,
was mostly due to word of mouth and occurred without any advertising on the part of Google
(Vise, 2005).
Social learning in consumption has enormous implications for firms. In the presence of
informational cascades, the return to attracting a new customer is different from the direct
effect that the customer has on profits. Attracting a new consumer has a multiplier effect on
profits because it may increase the demand of other consumers. The existence of this “social
multiplier” (Glaeser, Sacerdote and Scheinkman, 2003) implies that, for a given good, the
elasticity of aggregate demand to quality is larger than the elasticity of individual demand
to quality. Furthermore, social learning makes the success of a product more difficult to
predict, as demand depends on (potentially random) initial conditions. Two products of
similar quality may have vastly different demand in the long run, depending on whether the
initial set of potential consumers happens to like the product or not.
Social learning has been extensively studied in theory (Bikhchandani et al., 1992 and
1998; Banerjee, 1992). But despite its tremendous importance for firms, the empirical evidence is limited, because social learning is difficult to identify in practice. The standard
approach in the literature on peer effects and social interactions involves testing whether
an individual decision to purchase a particular good depends on the consumption decisions
and/or the product satisfaction of other individuals that are close, based on some metric.
Such an approach is difficult to implement in most cases. First, data on purchases of specific
goods by individual consumers are difficult to obtain. Second, because preferences are likely
to be correlated among peers, observing that individuals in the same group make similar
consumption decisions may simply reflect shared preferences, not informational spillovers.
In observational data, it is difficult to isolate factors that affect some individuals’ demand
for a good but not the demand of their peers.1

In this paper, I focus on consumption of movies. Since individual-level data are not
available, I use market-level data to test the predictions of a simple model that characterizes
the diffusion of information on movie quality following surprises in quality. In the model,
the quality of a movie is ex-ante uncertain, as consumers do not know for certain whether
they will like the movie or not.2 Consumers have a prior on quality–based on observable
characteristics of the movie such as the genre, actors, director, ratings and budget, etc.–and
they receive an individual-specific, unbiased signal on quality–which reflects how much the
concept of a movie resonates with a specific consumer.
I define social learning as a situation where consumers in week t update their prior based
on feedback from others who have seen the movie in previous weeks. The model predicts
different box office sales dynamics depending on whether a movie’s underlying quality is
better or worse than people’s expectations. Because the signal that each consumer receives
is unbiased, movies that have better than expected underlying quality have stronger than
expected demand in the opening weekend (on average). In the presence of social learning,
they become even more successful over time, as people update upwards their expectations
on quality. On the other hand, movies that have worse than expected quality have weaker
than expected demand in the opening weekend (on average) and become even less successful
over time. In other words, social learning should make successful movies more successful
and unsuccessful movies more unsuccessful. By contrast, without social learning, there is
no updating of individual expectations, and therefore there should be no divergence in sales
over time.
Surprises in the appeal of a movie are key to the empirical identification. I use a unique
feature of the movie industry to identify ex-ante demand expectations: the number of screens
dedicated to a movie in its opening weekend reflects the sales expectations held by the market.
The number of screens is a good summary measure of ex-ante demand expectations because it
is set by forward-looking, profit-maximizing agents–the theater owners–who have an incentive
to correctly predict first week demand. The number of screens should therefore reflect most
of the information that is available to the market before the opening on the expected appeal
of the movie, including actors, director, budget, ratings, advertising, reviews, competitors,
and every other demand shifter that is observed before opening day.3
While on average theaters predict first week demand correctly, there are cases where
they underpredict or overpredict the appeal of a movie. Take, for example, the movie
“Pretty Woman” (1990). Before the opening weekend it was expected to perform well,
since it opened in 1325 screens, more than the average movie. But in the opening weekend it
downloading where users are randomly provided with different amount of information on other users’ ratings.
Cai, Chen and Fang (2007) use a randomized experiment to study learning on menu items in restaurants.
2
Throughout the paper, the term quality refers to consumers’ utility. It has no reference to artistic value.
3
Some empirical tests lend credibility to this assumption. For example, in a regression that has opening
weekend sales as dependent variable, the inclusion of very detailed set of movie characteristics–budget,
genre, ratings, date of release, distributor, etc.–add virtually no predictive power once number of screens is
controlled for.

significantly exceeded expectations, totalling sales of about $23 million. In this case, demand
was significantly above what the market was expecting, presumably because the concept of
the movie or the look of Julia Roberts appealed to consumers more than one could have
predicted before the opening.
Using data on nation-wide sales by week for all movies released between 1982 and 2000,
I test five empirical implications of the model.
(1) In the presence of social learning, sales trends for positive and negative surprise movies
should diverge over time. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that the decline over time
of sales for movies with positive surprise is substantially slower than the decline of movies
with negative surprise. This finding is robust to controlling for advertising expenditures and
critic reviews, and to a number of alternative specifications. Moreover, the finding does not
appear to be driven by changes in supply or capacity constraints. For example, results are
not sensitive to using per-screen sales as the dependent variable instead of sales or dropping
movies that sell out in the opening weekend.
(2) The new information contained in peer feedback should be more important when
consumers have more diffuse priors. When a consumer is less certain whether she is going
to like a specific movie, the additional information represented by peer feedback on movie
quality should have more of an effect on her purchasing choices relative to the case where
the consumer is more certain. In practice, to identify movies for which consumers have more
precise priors, I use a dummy for sequels. It is reasonable to expect that consumers have
more precise priors for sequels than non-sequels. Additionally, to generalize this idea, I use
the variance of the first week surprise in box office sales by genre. Genres with large variance
in first week surprise are characterized by more uncertainty and therefore consumers should
have more diffuse priors on their quality. Consistent with social learning, I find that the
impact of a surprise on subsequent sales is significantly smaller for sequels and significantly
larger for genres that have a large variance in first week surprise.
(3) Social learning should be stronger for consumers with a large social network and
weaker for consumers with a small social network. While I do not have a direct measure of
social network, I assume that teenagers have more developed social networks than adults.
Consistent with social learning, I find that the effect of a surprise on subsequent sales is
larger for movies that target teenage audiences.
(4) Under social learning, surprises in opening weekend demand should only matter
insofar as they reflect new information on movie quality. They should not matter when they
reflect factors that are unrelated to movie quality, such as weather shocks. This prediction
is important because it allows one to separate social learning from a leading alternative
explanation of the evidence, the network effects hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that
the utility of watching a movie depends on the number of peers who have seen it or will
see it (for example, because people like discussing movies with friends). This implies that
each consumer’s demand for a good depends directly on the demand of other consumers.
To distinguish between network effects and social learning, I isolate surprises in first week
3

sales that are caused by weather shocks. Under social learning, a negative surprise in first
week demand due to bad weather should have no significant impact on sales in the following
weeks. Weather is unrelated to movie quality and therefore should not induce any updating.
By contrast, under the network effect hypothesis, a negative surprise in first week demand
for any reason, including bad weather, should lower sales in following weeks. Empirically, I
find no significant effect of surprises due to weather on later sales.
(5) Finally, the marginal amount of learning should decline over time, as more information
on quality becomes available. For example, the amount of updating that takes place in week
2 should be larger than the amount of updating that takes place in week 3 given what is
already known in week 2. Consistent with this prediction, I find that sales trends for positive
surprise movies are concave, and sales trends for negative surprise movies are convex.
Overall, the five implications of the model seem remarkably consistent with the data.
Taken individually, each piece of empirical evidence may not be sufficient to establish the
existence of social learning. But taken together, the weight of the evidence supports the
notion of social learning.
My estimates suggest that the amount of sales generated by social learning is substantial.
A movie with stronger than expected demand has $5.8 million in additional sales relative to
the counterfactual where the quality of the movie is the same but consumers don’t learn from
each other. This amounts to 38% of total revenues. From the point of view of the studios,
this implies the existence of a large multiplier. The total effect on profits of attracting an
additional consumer to see a given movie is significantly larger than the direct effect on
profits, because that consumer, if satisfied with the quality of the movie, will increase her
peers’ demand for the same movie.
Besides the substantive findings specific to the movie industry, this paper seeks to make
a broader methodological contribution. It demonstrates that it is possible to identify social
interactions using aggregate data and intuitive comparative statics. In situations where
individual-level, exogenous variation in peer group attributes is not available, this approach
has the potential to provide a credible alternative for the identification of social interactions.
Possible additional applications include studying social learning in the demand for books
(where the size of the first print provides a good measure of expected demand), music,
restaurants, cars or software. This paper is related to the earlier literature on technology
adoption, where diffusion models similar to the one developed here were used to document
the spreading of new technologies based on peer imitation (Griliches, 1957; Bass 1969). A
similar approach has been applied in an interesting recent study of political presidential
primaries (Knight and Schiff, 2007).4

Knight and Schiff (2007) find that a stronger than expected performance of a candidate in an early voting
state leads voters in other states to update their priors. Examples of existing papers on social learning in
consumption include: Liu (2006), who studies word-of-mouth effects in movies by measuring Internet postings
on a Yahoo Web Site; De Vaney and Cassey (2001), who present an analysis of the dynamics of box office
sales; Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Ikaheimo (2004), who use data on car purchases to estimate the effect of

The paper proceeds as follows. In sections 2 and 3 I outline a simple theoretical model
and its empirical implications. In sections 4 and 5 I describe the data and the empirical
identification of surprises. In sections 6 and 7 I describe my empirical findings. Section 8
concludes.

A Simple Model of Social Learning

In this section, I outline a simple framework that describes the effect of social learning
on sales. The idea–similar to the one adopted by Bikhchandani et al. (1992) and Banerjee
(1992)–is very simple. Consumers do not know in advance how much they are going to like
a movie. Before the opening weekend, consumers share a prior on the quality of the movie–
based on its observable characteristics–and they receive a private, unbiased signal on quality,
which reflects how much the concept of a movie resonates with a specific consumer. Expected
utility from consumption is a weighted average of the prior and the signal (where the weight
reflects the relative precision of the prior and the signal). Since the consumers’ private signal
is unbiased, high quality movies have on average a stronger appeal and therefore stronger
opening weekend sales, relative to low quality movies.
In week 2, consumers have more information, since they receive feedback from their peers
who have seen the movie in week 1. I define social learning as the process by which individuals
use feedback from their peers to update their own expectations of movie quality. In the
presence of social learning, a consumers expectation of consumption utility is a weighted
average of the prior, the signal and peer feedback, where, as before, the weights reflect
relative precisions. If a movie is better (worse) than expected, consumers in week 2 update
upward (downward) their expectations and therefore even more (less) consumers decide to
see the movie.
This setting generates the prediction that under social learning a movie whose demand
is unexpectedly strong (weak) in the opening weekend should do even better (worse) in the
following weeks. Without social learning, there is no reason for this divergence over time.
The setting also generates four additional comparative statics predictions that have to do
with the precision of the prior, the size of the social network, the functional form of movie
sales and the role of surprises that are orthogonal to quality.5
neighbors’ purchase decisions; and Sorensen (2007), who uses a dataset of university employees to document
social learning in health plan choices. Hendricks and Sorensen (2007) use a clever identification strategy
based on new album releases to analyze the role of information in music purchases. Bertrand, Mullainathan
and Luttmer (2000) and Hong, Kubik and Stein (2005) document social learning in welfare participation
and portfolio choices, respectively.
5
One difference with Banerjee (1992) and Bikhchandani et al. (1992) is that they focus on the conditions
that generate wrong cascades, where a good of high quality is not purchased because the first consumers
who consider the purchase receive a bad signal, and everybody else after them is affected by their decision.
Wrong equilibria are unlikely to be pervasive in my empirical application, because I use a large sample with
nation-wide data. While it is possible that some groups of friends end up in the wrong equilibrium, this is

5

The focus of the paper is empirical. The purpose of this section is only to formalize a
simple intuition, not to provide a general theoretical treatment of social learning. Therefore,
the model is designed to be simple and to generate transparent and testable predictions to
bring to the data. I follow Bikhchandani et al. (1992) and take the timing of consumption
as exogenous. I purposely do not attempt to model possible generalizations such as strategic
behavior or the value of waiting to obtain more information (option value).

2.1

Sales Dynamics With No Social Learning

The utility that individual i obtains from watching movie j is
Uij = αj∗ + νij

(1)

where αj∗ represents the quality of the movie for the average individual, and νij ∼ N (0, d1 )
represents how tastes of individual i for movie j differ from the tastes of the average individual.
I assume that αj∗ , and νij are unobserved. Given the characteristics of a movie that are observed prior to its release, individuals hold a prior on the quality of the movie. In particular,
I assume that
1
αj∗ ∼ N (Xj0 β,
)
(2)
mj
where Xj0 β represents consumers’ priors on how much they will like movie j. Specifically,
the vector Xj includes the characteristics of movie j that are observable before its release,
including its genre, budget, director, actors, ratings, distribution, date of release, advertising,
etc.; and mj is the precision of the prior, which is allowed to vary across movies. The reason
for differences in the precision of the prior is that the amount of information available to
consumers may vary across movies. For example, if a movie is a sequel, consumers may have
a tighter prior than if a movie is not a sequel.
Before the release of the movie, I assume that each individual also receives a noisy,
idiosyncratic signal of the quality of the movie:
sij = Uij + ij

(3)

I interpret this signal as a measure of how much the concept of movie j resonates with
consumer i. I assume that the signal is unbiased within a given movie and is normally
distributed with precision kj :
1
(4)
ij ∼ N (0, )
kj
The assumption that the prior and signal are unbiased is important because it ensures that,
while there is uncertainty for any given individual on the true quality of the movie, on
average individuals make the correct decisions regarding each movie. I also assume that ν ij
unlikely to be true systematically for the entire nation.

6

and ij are i.i.d. and independent of each other and independent of αj∗ ; that Xj , β, mj , kj
and d are known to all the consumers; and that consumers do not share their private signal.
The normal learning model indicates that the expected utility of the representative consumer in the opening weekend is a weighted average of the prior (Xj0 β) and the signal (sij ),
with weights that reflect the relative precision of the prior and the signal:
E1 [Uij |Xj0 β, sij ] =
h

hj

Xj0 β +
sij = ωj Xj0 β + (1 − ωj )sij

hj + k j

(5)

dm

j
where ωj = hj +k
, hj = d+mjj , and the subscript 1 on the expectation operator indicates that
j
the expectation is taken using the information available in week 1. When the prior is more
(less) precise than the signal, prospective consumers put more (less) weight on the prior.
I assume that a consumer decides to see a movie if her expected utility given what she
knows about the quality of the movie is higher than the cost:

E1 [Uij |Xj0 β, sij ] > qi1

(6)

The cost of going to the movie at time t, qit , may vary because it includes the opportunity
cost of time, which varies across individuals and over time. For example, going to the movies
may be very costly for a given individual if it conflicts with a work dinner, but it may be
very cheap for the same individual on a different night. Similarly, the opportunity cost of
time may vary across individuals. I assume that qit = q + uit , where uit ∼ N (0, 1r ) and i.i.d.6
If the population of potential consumers of this movie is N, the total number of tickets
sold in the opening weekend is a binomial random variable with mean N P1 and variance
N P1 (1 − P1 ), where the probability that individual i goes to see movie j in the opening
weekend is
P1 =

Prob(E1 [Uij |Xj0 β, sij ]

(1 − ωj )(αj∗ − Xj0 β) + Xj0 β − q
)
> qi1 ) = Φ(
σj1

(7)

q

where Φ() is the standard normal cumulative function and σj1 = (1 − ωj )2 (1/kj + 1/d)) + (1/r).
The term (αj∗ − Xj0 β) measures the surprise. In particular, it measures the distance
between the true quality of the movie, αj∗ , and consumers’ prior, Xj0 β. Compare two movies
with the same prior but with different true quality αj∗ . Imagine for example that the quality of
movie a is higher than its prior (αa∗ > Xa0 β) and the opposite is true for movie b (αb∗ < Xb0 β).
Equation 7 indicates that movie a will experience higher opening weekend sales than the
movie b. The reason is that the private signal received by consumers is unbiased, so that on
average consumers find the better movie more attractive. If a movie sells well in the opening
6

I assume that uit is independent of αj∗ , νij and ij . The assumption that uij is normal simplifies the
analysis, but is not completely realistic, because it implies that the cost of the movie can be infinitely low. An
alternative formulation that generates the same predictions involves assuming that the cost is fixed (q it = q)
and allowing for time-varying, idiosyncratic shocks to the utility of a movie. For example, one could assume
that ν in equation 1 varies over time: νijt .

7

week it is because the movie is of good quality and therefore many people received a good
signal.
What happens to the number of tickets sold in the weeks after the opening weekend? In
the absence of social learning, consumers in week 2 and later weeks have exactly the same
information that consumers have in week 1. This implies that Pt = P1 , for t ≥ 2. Therefore,
a movie that does surprisingly well in the first week experiences sales above its expected
value, but the difference between actual sales and expected sales remains constant over time.
This is represented as a parallel shift upward in the top panel of Figure 1. The amount of
sales each week is higher, but the two lines are parallel. The difference in intercept between
a movie that has higher than expected quality (αj∗ > Xj0 β), and a movie whose quality is as

expected (αj∗ = Xj0 β) is constant over time, is equal to Φ(
) − Φ( jσj1 ),
σj1
and is positive. The difference is negative in the case of a movie that does surprisingly poorly
in the first weekend. This case is represented by a parallel shift downward in the top panel
of Figure 1.
Note that sales are constant over time because I am implicitly assuming that consumers
may watch the same movie multiple times. This assumption greatly simplifies the analysis.
Below I show that the qualitative implications of the model do not change when consumers
are assumed to see a movie only once, so that sales trend down over time.

2.2

Sales Dynamics With Social Learning

With social learning, consumers have more information in week 2 than they did in week
1, because they receive feedback from their peers. Specifically, I assume that consumer i has
Ni peers. Of these Ni peers, ni see the movie in week 1 and communicate to consumer i
their ex-post utility: Upj , for p = 1, 2, ..., ni , where p indexes peers. Consumer i uses these
feedbacks to obtain an estimate of quality and update her expected utility.
To extract information on quality from peers’ feedback, consumer i needs to take into
account the fact that the set of peers from whom she receives feedback is selected. These
are the peers who ex-ante found the movie appealing enough that they decided to see it:
they tend to have a high signal spj .7 Consumer i receives a feedback from peer p only when
E1 [Upj |Xj0 β, spj ] > qp1 (equation 6). If she ignored this selection, and simply averaged the
feedbacks U1j , U2j , ..., Unj , consumer i would obtain a biased estimate of the quality of the
movie.
In this set up, there is information not only in feedback from peers who have seen the
movie, but also in the fact that some peers have decided not to see the movie. Since every
individual receives an independent signal on movie quality, the fact that some of her peers
have decided not to see the movie provides valuable additional information to consumer i.
In week 2, consumer i obtains an estimate of αj∗ from the observed U1j , U2j , ..., Uni j and
the number of peers who have not seen the movie, by maximizing the following maximum

The precision of the maximum likelihood estimator varies across individuals, because different individuals have different numbers of peers, Ni , and receive different numbers of

In week 2, consumer i’s best guess of how much she will like movie j is a weighted average
of the prior, her private signal, and the information that she obtains from her peers who
have seen that movie, with weights that reflect the relative precision of these three pieces of
information:

The probability that the representative consumer sees the movie in week t is therefore 13
(1 − wj1t )αj∗ + wj1t Xj0 β − q
)
Pt = Φ(

(12)

Three points are worth noting here. First, individuals receive new feedback each week,
and therefore the prior and the individual signal become less important over time and the
true film quality becomes more important over time. It is clear from equation 12 that as t
grows, sales are determined less and less by Xj0 β, and more and more by αj∗ , because wj1t
declines over time and 1 − wj1t increases over time. In the limit, when t is very large, the
α∗ −q
true quality of the movie is completely revealed, and limt→∞ Pt = Φ( 1/j √r ).
Second, the marginal increase in information declines over time. For example, the increase
in information that a consumer experiences between week 1 and week 2 is larger than the
increase in information that a consumer experiences between week 2 and week 3, given the
information available in week 2. And the latter is larger than the increase in information
that a consumer experiences between week 3 and week 4, given the information available in
week 3. When t is small, the consumer has limited information on αj∗ and the additional
information provided by the maximum likelihood estimator based on peer feedbacks may be
significant. But when t is large, the consumer has already obtained many estimates of αj∗
so that the marginal information provided by an additional week is limited. Formally, the
2
weight on the prior not only declines but declines at a slowing rate: ∂ ∂tw2j1t < 0.
Third, equation 9 makes clear that the larger the group of peers of individual i, Ni , the
more precise the estimate of quality available to individual i. This makes intuitive sense.
Having feedback from 20 peers is more informative than having feedback from 1 peer.
I am interested in characterizing the change over time in the probability that a consumer
decides to see a given movie as a function of the first week surprise. For simplicity, consider
first a movie whose ex-ante expected value is equal to its average cost: X 0 β = q. Three cases
are relevant:
(1) Positive Surprise. If the true quality of the movie is higher than the prior (αj∗ >
Xj0 β), then sales in the opening weekend are higher than the case of no surprise, and they
grow over time. It is possible to show that
∂Pt

This is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 1. The intercept shifts upward, reflecting the
fact that the movie is a positive surprise in the opening weekend. The positive slope reflects
the fact that consumers in week 2 observe the utility of their peers in week 1 and infer that
the movie is likely to be better than their original expectation. Furthermore, while we know
from equation 11 that each passing week adds more information, the marginal value of this
information declines over time. It is possible to show that
∂ 2 Pt
<0
∂t2

if αj∗ > Xj0 β

(14)

This implies that the function that describes the evolution of ticket sales over time is concave.
(2) Negative Surprise. The opposite is true if the true quality of the movie is lower
than the prior (αj∗ < Xj0 β). In this case the probability of seeing the movie is lower at the
opening weekend and declining over time:
∂Pt
<0
∂t

if αj∗ < Xj0 β

(15)

This is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 1. Moreover, because the value of marginal
information declines over time, the function that describes ticket sales is convex in time:
∂ 2 Pt
>0
∂t2

if αj∗ < Xj0 β

(16)

(3) No Surprise. If the true quality of the movie is equal to the prior (αj∗ = Xj0 β), then
the probability of going to see the movie is on average constant over time: Pt = P1 . In this
case, there is no surprise regarding the quality of the movie and social learning has no effect
on ticket sales.
In the more general case where Xj0 β is not equal to q, the expression for the surprise
is more complicated, but the intuition is similar: for a given prior Xj0 β, a large enough αj∗
is associated with an increase in intercept and a positive slope, while a small enough αj∗ is
associated with a decrease in intercept and a negative slope. Additionally, the inequalities
in equations 14 and 16 also generalize.

2.3

Extensions

Because the main goal of the paper is empirical, the above model is kept purposefully
simple. Here I informally discuss how the predictions of the model might change if two
assumptions are relaxed.
(1) No Repeated Purchases The simple model above assumes the utility of watching
a movie does not decline in the number of times a consumer watches it. As a result, it fails
to capture an important feature of the dynamics of movie ticket sales, namely that sales
of movies typically decline over time. I now consider the more realistic case in which most
consumers do not go to the same movie twice. This feature allows ticket sales for a given

11

movie to decline over time. It complicates the analysis, but does not change the fundamental
intuition.
While the probability that the representative consumer sees a movie in week 1 is the
same P1 defined in equation 7, the probability for subsequent weeks changes. Consider first
the case where there is no social learning. The probability that the representative consumer
sees the movie in week 2 is now the joint probability that her expected utility at t = 2
is higher than her cost and her expected utility at t = 1 is lower than her cost: P2 =
Prob(E1 [Uij |Xj0 β, sij ] < qi1 andE2 [Uij |Xj0 β, sij ] > qi2 ). It is clear that P2 < P1 . Intuitively,
many of the consumers who expect to like a given movie watch it during the opening weekend.
Those left are less likely to expect to like the movie, so that attendance in the second week
is weaker than in the first.
The key point here is that, while all movies exhibit a decline in sales over time, this
decline is more pronounced for movies that experience strong sales in the first weekend. In
particular, under these assumptions, it is possible to show that
∂ 2 Pt
<0
∂t∂αj∗

(17)

A strong performance in week 1 reduces the base of potential customers in week 2. The
effect of this intertemporal substitution is that the decline in sales over time is accelerated
compared to the case of a movie that has an average performance in week 1, although the
total number remains higher because the intercept is higher. The opposite is true if a movie
is worse than expected. Both cases are represented in the top panel of Figure 2.
How do these predictions change with social learning? With social learning,
P2 = Prob(E2 [Uij |Xj0 β, sij , Sij2 ] > qi2 and E1 [Uij |Xj0 β, sij ] < qi1 )
= Prob(wj22 (νij + ij ) + wj32 (Sij2 − αj∗ ) − ui2 ) > (q − (1 − wj12 )αj∗ − wj12 Xj0 β)
and (wj21 (νij + ij ) + wj31 (Sij1 − αj∗ ) − ui1 ) < (q − (1 − wj11 )αj∗ − wj11 Xj0 β))
The answer depends on the strength of the social learning effect. If social learning is weak,
the dynamics of sales will look qualitatively similar to the ones in the top panel of Figure 2,
although the slope of the movie characterized by a positive (negative) surprise is less (more)
negative. But if social learning is strong enough, the dynamics of sales will look like the
ones in the bottom part of Figure 2, where the slope of the movie characterized by a positive
(negative) surprise is less (more) negative than the slope of the average movie.
(2) Option Value. In my setting I follow Bikhchandani et al. (1992) and model
the timing of purchase as exogenous. This greatly simplifies the model. In each period,
individuals decide whether to see a particular movie by comparing its expected utility to
the opportunity cost of time, qit , assumed to be completely idiosyncratic. This assumption
is not completely unrealistic, because it says that individuals have commitments in their
lives (such as work or family commitments) that are not systematically correlated with the
opening of movies. On the other hand, it ignores the possibility that consumers might want
12

to wait for uncertainty to be resolved before making a decision.
In the case of the latter possibility, consumers would have an expected value of waiting
to decide, as in the Dixit and Pindyck (1994) model of waiting to invest. This would give
rise to an option value associated with waiting. Like in the myopic case described above,
a consumer in this setting decides to see the movie in week 1 only if her private signal on
quality is high enough relative to the opportunity cost of time. However, the signal that
triggers consumption in the option value case is higher than its equivalent in the myopic
case, because waiting generates information and therefore has value. This implies a lower
probability of going to see the movie in week 1.
If ij and qit remain independent of all individual and movie characteristics, and individuals take their peers’ timing as given, the model generates the same set of implications.
While decisions are more prudent in the strategic case than in the myopic case, the timing
of purchase remains determined by the realization of the signal and of qit , and thus remains
unsystematic. Therefore, information diffusion follows similar dynamics to those described
above.14

3

Empirical Predictions

The model above has several testable predictions that I bring to the data in sections 6
and 7.
1. In the presence of strong enough social learning, sales of movies with stronger than
expected opening weekend demand and sales of movies with weaker than expected
opening weekend demand should diverge over time. This prediction is shown in Figures
1 and 2 and follows from equations 13 and 15. In the absence of social learning, or
with weak social learning, we should see no divergence over time or even convergence.
2. In the presence of social learning, the effect of a surprise should be stronger for movies
with a more diffuse prior and weaker for movies with a more precise prior. Intuitively,
when a consumer has a precise idea of whether she is going to like a specific movie
(strong prior), the additional information provided by her peers should matter less
relative to the case when a consumer has only a vague idea of how much she is going
to like a movie (weak prior). Formally, this is evident from equation 11. A more
precise prior (a larger hj ) implies a larger ωj1t , and therefore a smaller ωj3t (everything
else constant). This means that with a more precise prior, the additional information
provided by the peers, Sijs , will receive less weight, while the prior, Xj0 β, will receive
more weight. In the absence of social learning, there is no particular reason for why
14

A more complicated scenario arises if timing of purchase strategically depends on peers’ timing. This
could happen, for example, if some individuals wait for their friends to go see the movie in order to have
a more precise estimate of their signal, and their peers wait for the same reason. This scenario might have
different implications and is outside the scope of the paper.

13

the correlation between sales trend and first week surprise should vary systematically
with precision of the prior.
3. In the presence of social learning, the effect of a surprise should be stronger for consumers who have larger social networks. The idea is that receiving feedback from 20
peers is more informative than receiving feedback from 2 peers. Formally, this is clear
from equations 9 and 11. Equation 9 shows that a larger Ni implies a more precise estimate of movie quality based on peer feedback (i.e. a smaller variance of Sijt ). In turn,
equation 11 indicates that a smaller variance of Sijt implies a larger ωj3t and smaller
ωj1t and ωj2t . In the absence of social learning, there is no particular reason for why
the correlation between sales trend and first week surprise should vary systematically
with size of the social network.
4. In the presence of social learning, the marginal effect of a surprise on sales should
decline over time. For example, the amount of updating that takes place in week 2
should be larger than the amount of updating that takes place in week 3 given what is
already known in week 2. The implication is that the pattern of sales of movies with a
positive (negative) surprise should be concave (convex) in time. This is evident from
equations 14 and 16. In the absence of social learning, there is no particular reason for
why the curvature of sales over time should vary systematically with the sign of first
week surprise.
5. In the presence of social learning, consumers should only respond to surprises that
reflect new information on movie quality. They should not update their priors based
on surprises that reflect factors other than movie quality. For example, consider the
case of a movie whose opening weekend demand is weaker than expected because of
bad weather. In this case, low demand in first week does not imply that the quality of
the movie is low. Therefore, low demand in the first week should not lead consumers
to update and should have no negative impact on subsequent sales.15 In the absence
of social learning, there is no particular reason for why variation in first week demand
due to surprises in movie quality and variation in first week demand due to factors
unrelated to quality should have different effects on sales trends.

Data

I use data on box office sales from the firm ACNielsen-EDI. The sample includes all
movies that opened between 1982 and 2000 for which I have valid sales and screens data. 16
15

Formally, one can think of weather shocks as part of the cost of going to see the movie, u it . In the case
of bad weather in the opening weekend, ui1 is high for many consumers.
16
I drop from the sample movies for which sales or number of screens are clearly misreported. In particular,
I drop movies that report positive sales in a week, but zero number of screens, or vice-versa. I am interested

14

Beside total box office sales by movie and week, it reports production costs, detailed genre
classification, ratings and distributor. I have a total of 4,992 movies observed for 8 weeks.
Total sample size is therefore 4, 992 × 8 = 39, 936. This dataset was previously used in
Goettler and Leslie (2005).
I augment box office sales data with data on advertising and critic reviews. Unfortunately,
these data are available only for a limited number of years. Data on TV advertising by movie
and week were purchased from the firm TNS Media Intelligence. They include the totality
of TV advertising expenditures for the years 1995 to 2000. Data on movie reviews were hand
collected for selected years and newspapers by a research assistant. The exact date of the
review and an indicator for whether the review is favorable or unfavorable were recorded.
These data were collected for The New York Times for the movies opening in the years 1983,
1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999; for The Wall Street Journal, USA Today,
The Chicago Sun-Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and
The Houston Chronicle for the movies opening in the years 1989, 1997 and 1999; and for
The San Francisco Chronicle for the movies opening in the years 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1997
and 1999.
Summary statistics are in Table 1. The average movie has box office sales equal to $1.78
million in the average week. Box office sales are higher in the opening weekend: $3.15 million.
Production costs amount to $4.54 million. All dollar figures are in 2005 dollars. The average
movie is shown on 449 screens on average and on 675 screens in the opening weekend. The
average movie has $6.85 million in cumulative TV advertising expenditures. About half of
the reviews are favorable. The bottom of the table shows the distribution of movies across
genres. Comedy, drama and action are the three most common genres.
The top panel in Figure 3 plots the typical evolution of box office sales over time. The
figure shows a steep decline in the first few weeks and a slowing down in the rate of decline
in the following weeks. The bottom panel in Figure 3 shows the evolution of log sales. The
figure shows that the decline in sales is remarkably log linear. This is convenient, because
the use of log-linear models will simply the empirical analysis.
Not all movies have positive sales for the entire 8 week period. Because the dependent
variable in the econometric models will be in logs, this potentially creates a selection problem.
To make sure that my estimates are not driven by the potentially non-random selection of
poorly performing movies out of the sample, throughout the paper I report estimates where
the dependent variable is the log of sales +$1. The main advantage of this specification is
that it uses a balanced panel: all movies have non-missing values for each of the 8 weeks.
(I have also re-estimated my models using the selected sample that has positive sales and
found generally similar results.)
in movies that are released nationally. Therefore, I drop movies that open only in New York and Los Angeles.

5

Identification of Surprise in Opening Week Demand

The first step in testing the predictions of the model is to empirically identify surprise
in opening weekend sales. I define the surprise as the difference between realized box office
sales and predicted box office sales in the opening weekend, and I use the number of screens
in the opening weekend as a sufficient statistic for predicted sales. Specifically, I use the
residual from a regression of first week log sales on log number of screens as my measure of
movie-specific surprise. (In some specifications, I also control for genre, ratings, distribution,
budget and time of release.)
Number of screens is arguably a valid measure of the ex-ante expectations of demand for
a given movie because it is set by profit-maximizing agents (the theater owners), who have
a financial incentive to correctly predict consumer demand for a movie. Number of screens
should therefore summarize the market expectation of how much a movie will sell based on
all information available before opening day: cast, director, budget, advertising before the
opening weekend, the quality of reviews before the opening weekend, the buzz in blogs, the
strength of competitors, and any other demand shifter that is observed by the market before
the opening weekend.
Deviations from this expectation can therefore be considered a surprise. These deviations
reflect surprises in how much the concept of a movie and its cast resonate with the public.
While theaters seem to correctly guess demand for movies on average, there are cases where
the appeal of a movie and therefore its opening weekend demand is higher or lower than
expected. These surprises are the ones used in this paper for identification.17 Formally,
theaters seek to predict P1 in equation 7. It is easy to show that in the case of a positive
surprise in quality–i.e. when a movie true quality is higher than the prior (αj∗ > Xj0 β)–
theaters’ prediction, Pˆ1 is lower than realized sales: Pˆ1 < P1 . The opposite is true in the
case of a negative surprise–i.e. when a movie true quality is lower than the prior (αj∗ < Xj0 β).
In this latter case, Pˆ1 > P1 .18
Column 1 in Appendix Table A1 shows that the unconditional regression of log sales in
17

The data suggests that the number of screens set in the first weekend by theaters is on average exactly
proportional to consumers’ demand. A regression of log screens in the first weekend on log sales in the first
weekend should yield a coefficient close to 1 if the theaters’ prediction is correct on average. Empirically,
this regression yields a coefficient equal to 1.01 (.004). Thus, if the actual demand for movie a in the opening
weekend is 10% higher than the demand for movie b, the number of screens in the opening weekend is on
average 10% higher for movie a than movie b.
18
To see why, assume that theaters have the same information as consumers and use this information to
predict P1 in equation 7. The terms ωj , Xj0 β, q and σj1 are known, but αj∗ is unknown. Assume that theaters
use the normal learning model to predict αj∗ : E1 [αj∗ |Xj0 β, sij ] = wj Xj0 β +(1−wj )sij where wj = mj /(aj +mj )
and aj = (dkj )/(d + kj ). The weight on the prior used by theaters (wj ) is different from the weight on the
prior used by consumers (ωj in equation 5). In particular, it is easy to see that wj > ωj . This implies that
even if consumers and theaters have the same information, theaters put more weight on the prior and less on
their private signal. Intuitively, this is because theaters seek to predict αj∗ while consumers seek to predict
Uij .

16

first weekend on log screens in first weekend yields a coefficient equal to .89 (.004), with R 2
of .907. This regression is estimated on a sample that includes one observation per movie (N
= 4,992). The R2 indicates that about 90% of the variation in first week sales is predicted by
theater owners. Thus, about 10% of the variation cannot be predicted by theater owners. 19
Columns 2 to 7 show what happens to the predictive power of the model as I include
an increasingly rich set of covariates. If my assumption is correct and number of screens is
indeed a good summary measure of all the information that the market has available on the
likely success of a movie, the inclusion of additional covariates should have limited impact
on R2 . In column 2, the inclusion of 16 dummies for genre has virtually no impact, as R 2
increases from .907 to .908. Similarly, the inclusion of production costs and 8 dummies for
ratings raises R2 only marginally, from .908 to .912. Including 273 dummies for the identity
of the distributor, 12 dummies for months, 56 dummies for week, 6 dummies for weekday
and 18 dummies for year raises R2 to .937. Overall, it is safe to say that the addition of
all available controls has a limited impact on the fit of the model once number of screens is
controlled for.
Appendix Table A2 shows the distribution of surprises in the opening weekend box office
sales, together with some examples of movies. For example, the entry for 75% indicates that
opening weekend sales for the movie at the 75th percentile are 46% higher than expected.
The distribution appears symmetric, and it is centered around 0.02. Since surprise is a
regression residual, its mean is zero by construction.
An example of a movie characterized by large positive surprise is “The Silence of the
Lambs”. Before the opening weekend, it was expected to perform well, since it opened
on 1479 screens, substantially above the average movie. But in the opening weekend, it
significantly exceeded expectations, totalling sales of about $25 million. In this case, sales
were significantly higher than the amount theaters were expecting based on the screens
assigned to it. Other examples of movies that experienced significant positive surprises are
“Ghostbusters,” “Sister Act” and “Breakin.” More typical positive surprises are represented
by movies in the 75th percentile of the surprise distribution, such as “Alive,” “Who Framed
Roger Rabbit” and “House Party.” For many movies, the demand in the first week is close to
market expectations. Examples of movies close to the median include “Highlander 3,” “The
Bonfire of the Vanities,” “The Sting 2,” and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Examples of
19

There is ample evidence that the movie industry is focused on opening weekend box office sales. There
are countless newspaper articles and web sites devoted to predictions of opening weekend box office sales,
and at least two web sites that allow betting on opening weekend box office sales. (Unfortunately, betting
sites did not exist during the period for which I have sales data.) This attention to opening weekend box
office sales is consistent with the notion that demand is uncertain, even just days before the opening. During
production, studios do use focus groups to determine which aspects of the story are more likely to resonate
with the public and how to best tailor advertising to different demographic groups. The unpredictable
component of demand that I focus on here is very different in nature, as it takes place just before release.
I am not aware of focus group analysis performed after production and marketing are completed to predict
first weekend sales.

17

negative surprise include “Home Alone 3,” “Pinocchio,” “Lassie,” and “The Phantom of the
Opera.” These four movies opened on a large number of screens (between 1,500 and 1,900),
but had first weekend box office sales lower than one would expect based on the number
of screens. Interestingly, there are two very different versions of Tarzan movies. One is an
example of a strong negative surprise (“Tarzan and the Lost City”), while the second one is
a strong positive surprise (“Tarzan”).
One might wonder whether theaters might find it profitable to set the number of screens
not equal to the expected demand. For example, would it be optimal to systematically
lower the number of screens to artificially boost surprise in first week demand? It seems
unlikely. First, consumers would probably discount systematic underscreening and would
adjust their expectations accordingly. More fundamentally, number of screens is simply a
summary measure that I use to quantify expectations on demand. In my model, consumers’
expected utility is based on movie underlying characteristics (director, actors, genre, etc.)
as well as their private signal. For a given set of movie characteristics and for a given
signal, manipulation of the number of screens would have no impact on consumer demand.
The reason is that consumers in week 2 do not respond causally to surprises in first week
demand. They respond causally only to variation in movie quality. Manipulating surprises
in first week demand without changing actual movie quality is unlikely to generate higher
demand and higher profits.

6

Empirical Evidence

I now present empirical tests of the five implications of the model described in section 3.
I begin in sub-section 6.1 with tests of prediction 1. In subsection 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4, I present
tests of predictions 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Later, in Section 7 I discuss the interpretation
of the evidence and I present a test of prediction 5.

6.1

Prediction 1: Surprises and Sale Dynamics

Graphical Evidence. The main implication of the model is that in the presence of
social learning, movies with a positive surprise in first weekend sales should have a slower
rate of decline in sales than movies with a negative surprise in first weekend sales (prediction
1). In the absence of social learning, movies with a positive and negative surprise should
have the same rate of decline in sales.
Figure 4 shows a graphical test of this prediction based on the raw data. It shows
unconditional average log sales by week and surprise status. The upper line represents the
decline in average sales for movies with a positive surprise, and the bottom line represents
the decline for movies with a negative surprise. The pattern shown in the Figure is striking.
Consistent with Prediction 1, movies with a positive surprise experience a slower decline
in sales than movies with a negative surprise. As a consequence, the distance between
18

the average sales of positive and negative surprise movies is relatively small in the opening
weekend, but increases over time. After 8 weeks the difference is much larger than in week
1.
Baseline Estimates. To test whether the difference in slopes between positive and
negative surprise movies documented in Figure 4 is statistically significant, I estimate models
of the form
ln yjt = β0 + β1 t + β2 (t × Sj ) + dj + ujt
(18)
where ln yjt is the log of box office sales in week t; Sj is surprise or an indicator for positive
surprise; and dj is a movie fixed effect. Identification comes from the comparison of the
change over time in sales for movies with a positive and a negative surprise. To account for
the possible serial correlation of the residual within a movie, standard errors are clustered
by movie throughout the paper.
The coefficient of interest is β2 . A finding of β2 > 0 is consistent with the social learning
hypothesis, since it indicates that the rate of decline of sales of movies with positive surprise
is slower than the rate of decline of sales of movies with negative surprise, as in Figure 4. A
finding of β2 = 0, on the other hand, is inconsistent with the social learning hypothesis, since
it indicates that the rate of decline of sales of movies with positive and negative surprise is
the same.20
It is important to note that the interpretation of β2 is not causal. The model in section
2 clarifies that, under social learning, a stronger than expected demand in week 1 does not
cause a slower decline in sales in the following weeks. A stronger than expected demand in
week 1 simply indicates (to the econometrician) that the underlying quality of the movie is
better than people had expected. It is the fact that movie quality is better than expected
and the diffusion of information about movie quality that cause the slower decline in sales
in the weeks following a positive surprise in first week demand. A positive surprise in first
week demand is simply a marker for better than expected quality.
Estimates of variants of equation 18 are in Table 2. In column 1, I present the coefficient
from a regression that only includes a time trend. This quantifies the rate of decay of sales for
the average movie, shown graphically in the bottom panel in Figure 3. The entry indicates
that the coefficient on t is -.926. In column 2, the regression includes the time trend×surprise,
with surprise defined as the residual from a regression of log sales on number of screens,
indicators for genre, ratings, production cost, distribution, week, month, year and weekday.
(This definition of surprise is the one used in column 7 of Table A1.) The coefficient β2
from this regression is equal to .46 and is statistically different from zero. Since the variable
“surprise” has by construction mean zero, the coefficient on t is the same in column 1 and 2.
20

Because S is estimated, it contains some error. Estimates of β2 are therefore biased toward zero, and
the reported standard errors should in theory be adjusted to reflect this additional source of variability.
Also, because t is predetermined, the following model yields the same estimates of β1 and β2 : ln yjt =
β0 + β1 t + β2 (t × Sj ) + β3 Sj + ujt .

19

In column 3, Sj is an indicator for whether surprise is positive. The entry for β2 quantifies
the difference in rate of decay between positive and negative surprise movies shown graphically in Figure 4. The entry indicates that the rate of decline for movies with a negative
surprise is -1.25, while the rate of decline for movies with a positive surprise is about half as
big: −1.25 + .619 = −.63. This difference between positive and negative surprise movies is
both statistically and economically significant.
In column 4, I divide the sample into three equally sized groups depending on the magnitude of the surprise, and I allow for the rate of decline to vary across terciles. Compared
to the model in column 3, this specification is less restrictive because it allows the rate of
decline to vary across three groups, instead of two. I find that the rate of decline is a monotonic function of surprise across these three groups. The coefficient for the first tercile (most
negative surprise) is -1.32. The coefficient for the second tercile (zero or small surprise) is
-.98. The coefficient for the third tercile (most positive surprise) is -.47.
To better characterize the variation in the rate of decline of sales, I estimate a more
general model that allows for a movie-specific decline:
ln yjt = β0 + β1j t + dj + ujt

(19)

where the rate of decline β1j is now allowed to vary across movies. Table 2 has already
established that the mean rate of decline of positive surprise movies is larger the mean rate
of decline of negative surprise movies. I use estimates of β1j in equation 19 to compare
the entire distribution of movie-specific slopes for positive and negative surprise movies, as
opposed to just the first moment. This specification is therefore more general than the
models in Table 2, because it does not force the rate of decline to be the same with group.
Figure 5 and Table 3 show the distribution of the coefficients β1j separately for positive
and negative surprise movies. It is clear that the distribution of the slope coefficients for
movies with a positive surprise is more to the right than the distribution of the slope coefficients for movies with a negative surprise, as predicted by the model. For example, the
25th percentile, the median and the 75th percentile are -.96, -.41 and -.11 for positive surprise
movies, and -1.91, -1.23 and -.60 for negative surprise movies.
Advertising. One might be concerned that the difference in sales trends between positive and negative surprise movies may be caused by changes in advertising expenditures
induced by the surprise. If studios initially set their optimal advertising budget based on the
expected performance of a movie, then it is plausible that a surprise in actual performance
will change their first order conditions. In particular, if studios adjust their advertising expenditures based on first week surprise, estimates in Table 2 may be biased, although the
sign of the bias is a priori undetermined.21
21

The sign of the bias depends on whether the marginal advertising dollar raises revenues more for positive
or negative surprise movies.

20

In practice, endogenous changes in advertising do not appear to be a major factor in
explaining my results. First, most advertising takes place before the release of a movie,
primarily because studios–who are responsible for most advertising—receive a higher share
of profits from earlier weeks than later weeks. In my sample, 94% of TV advertising occurs
before the opening day. Thus, the majority of advertising should already be reflected in the
number of screens and therefore should not enter surprise.
Second, and most importantly, directly controlling for advertising does not significantly
affect estimates. This is shown in the top panel of Table 4. As explained in the data section,
advertising data are not available for all movies. For convenience, columns 1 and 2 report
baseline estimates of equation 18, reproduced from columns 2 and 3 of Table 2. Columns
3 and 4 report estimates of the same models obtained using the sub-sample of movies for
which I have advertising data. The comparison of columns 1 and 2 with columns 3 and 4
suggests that the sub-sample of movies for which I have ad data generates estimates that
are qualitatively similar to the full sample estimates. In columns 5 and 6, I use the sample
used for columns 3 and 4 and include a control for TV advertising. Specifically, I control for
the logarithm of cumulative total expenditures for television advertising until the relevant
week.22
The comparison of columns 5 and 6 with columns 3 and 4 suggests that the inclusion of
controls for TV advertising has limited impact on my estimates. Specifically, the coefficients
on time and time × surprise change from -.940 and .700 (column 3) to -.996 and .661 (column
5), respectively. The coefficients on time and time × an indicator for surprise change from 1.320 and .777 (column 4) to -1.329 and .730 (column 6), respectively. Increases in advertising
expenditures are associated with sizable increases in box office sales. The coefficient on log
advertising is between .9 and 1.1, indicating that the elasticity of box office sales relative
to cumulative advertising expenditures is close to 1. My data on advertising also identify
specific types of TV ads. For example, the data separately report expenditures for cable,
network, spot, and others. I have re-estimated columns 5 and 6 allowing for separate effects
for each type of ad and found estimates very similar to the ones reported.
I also note that even if advertising could explain the slower decline in sales for positive
surprise movies, it does not explain the comparative statics results on the precision of the
prior and the size of the social network that I describe in sub-sections 6.2 and 6.3 below.
Critic Reviews. Another potentially important omitted variable is represented by critic
reviews. The concern is that movie critics react to a surprise in opening weekend by covering
unexpected successes. This could have the effect of boosting sales for positive surprise movies,
22

Cumulative expenditures for advertising for movie j in week t represent the sum of expenditures for all
TV ads broadcasted for movie j until week t. The reason for using cumulative expenditures, as opposed to
current expenditures, is that the demand in week t presumably depends both on ads in week t and ads in
earlier weeks. I have experimented with alternative specifications. For example, in models where advertising
is defined as the sum of ad expenditures in the previous 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks, results are very similar.

21

thus generating the difference in rate of decline between positive and negative surprise movies
documented above. Like advertising, the majority of reviews take place before the release of
a movie. In my data, 85% of newspaper reviews are published at or before the date of the
opening.
Directly controlling for positive reviews does not affect estimates significantly. This is
shown in the bottom panel of Table 4. As for advertising, data on reviews are available only
for a subset of movies. Columns 1 and 2 report baseline estimates reproduced from Table 2.
In columns 3 and 4 I report estimates of the baseline model obtained using the sub-sample
for which I have data on reviews. In columns 5 and 6, I control for the cumulative share of
reviews that are favorable as a fraction of all the reviews published until the relevant week.
The comparison of columns 5 and 6 with columns 3 and 4 suggests that the inclusion of
controls reviews has limited impact on my estimates. The coefficients on time and time ×
surprise change from -.856 and .509 (column 3) to -.927 and .494 (column 5), respectively.
The coefficients on time and time × an indicator for surprise change from -1.163 and .603
(column 4) to -1.227 and .582 (column 6), respectively. The coefficient on favorable reviews
is positive and significantly different from zero, although it can not necessarily be interpreted causally. I have also re-estimated the models in columns 5 and 6 separately for each
newspaper and found similar results.23
Like for advertising, I also note that if the only reason for a slow-down in the rate of
decline of positive surprise movies were critic reviews, we would not necessarily see the
comparative statics results on the precision of the prior and size of the social network that
I describe in subsections 6.2 and 6.3 below.
Supply Effects. So far, I have implicitly assumed that all the variation in sales reflects
consumer demand. However, it is possible that changes in the availability of screens affect
sales. Consider the case where there is no social learning, but some theater owners react to
the first week surprise by adjusting the movies they screen. This type of supply effect has the
potential to affect sales, especially in small towns, where the number of screens is limited.
For example, in week 2 a theater owner in a small town may decide to start screening a
movie that had a positive surprise elsewhere, thereby increasing the number of customers
who have access to that movie.
This is important because it implies that the evidence in Table 2 may be explained not
23

Specifically, the coefficients on time and time × surprise for USA Today are -.83 (.03) and .60 (.04)
without controls (column 3); and -.83 (.03) and .59 (.04) controlling for favorable reviews (column 5). For
the Wall Street Journal are: -.70 (.05), .46 (.07) without controls and -.72 (.05) and .45 (.07) with controls.
For the New York Times: -.85 (.02) and .50 (.03) without controls; -.86 (.02) and .51 (.02) with controls. For
the Los Angeles Times: -.83 (.03) and .51 (.03) without controls; -.84 (.03) and .51 (.03) with controls. For
the San Francisco Chronicle: -.81 (.03) and .56 (.03) without controls; -.87 (.03) and .54 (.03) with controls.
For the Atlanta Journal Constitution: -.86 (.04) and .60 (.04) without controls; -.91 (.04) and .58 (.04) with
controls. For the Houston Chronicle: -.82 (.03) and .58 (.03) without controls; -.87 (.03) and .56 (.03) with
controls.

by learning on the part of consumers, but by learning on the part of theater owners. To test
for this possibility, I have re-estimated my models using sales per screen as the dependent
variable. In this specification, the focus is on changes in the average number of viewers
for a given number of screens. These results are therefore not affected by changes in the
number of theaters screening a given movie. Columns 1 and 3 of Table 5 correspond to a
specification where Sj is the surprise of movie j, while columns 2 and 4 correspond to a
specification where Sj is a dummy for whether the surprise of movie j is positive. Overall,
estimates of the effect of a surprise are qualitatively robust to the change in the definition of
the dependent variable, although the magnitude of the effect declines relative to the baseline.
For example, entries in column 2 indicate that the rate of decline of a positive and negative
surprise movie are -.64 and -1.25, respectively. The corresponding rates of decline in column
4 are -.52 and -.80. In other words, in column 2 the rate of decline of a positive surprise
movie is only half of the rate of decline of a negative surprise movie, while in column 4 the
rate of decline of a positive surprise movie is 65% of the rate of decline of a negative surprise
movie.
Note that the interpretation of this specification requires caution. Number of screens is
an endogenous variable, which presumably adjusts as a function of demand shocks. If there
is social learning, a positive surprise in week 1 will result in an increase in demand in the
following weeks, and, as a consequence, it will also cause an increase in the number of screens
devoted to that particular movie. While the specification in Table 5 is helpful in testing for
the possibility of supply effects, it is not my preferred specification because, by focusing in
sales per screen, it discards useful variation in the dependent variable.
I also note that an increase in number of screens alone would not explain the difference
in the effect of surprise for teen movies and non-teen movies that I document below in
sub-section 6.3.
Sold-out Movies. Another possible interpretation of Table 2 is that the slower decline
in sales for positive surprise movies reflects sold out movies, not social learning. Suppose for
example that demand in week 1 exceeds capacity and that some of this excess demand gets
shifted to later weeks. To test this possibility directly, I re-estimate equation 18 excluding
movies that might have sold out. In particular, I re-estimate my models dropping movies
that are in the top 1%, 3% or 5% of the per-screen attendance distribution. Estimates in
columns 5 and 6 of Table 5–obtained by dropping movies that are in the top 5% of the
per-screen attendance distribution–indicate that results are robust to this specification.
Furthermore, this alternative explanation is not consistent with the comparative statics
on precision of the prior and of the signal documented in sub-sections 6.2 and 6.3 below. If
the only thing driving results is that some positive surprise movies are sold out, we should
not expect to see the effect of surprise vary systematically with the precision of the prior.
Robustness. Here I probe the robustness of estimates in Table 2 using two sets of
23

alternative specifications. First, I investigate whether my estimates are sensitive to changes
in the definition of surprise. In Table 2, surprise was the residual in a regression of log sales
on number of screens and controls, including 16 dummies for genre, 8 dummies for ratings,
cost of production, and controls for timing of the opening (18 dummies for year, 12 dummies
for month, 52 dummies for week of the year, and 7 dummies for day of the week). If number
of screens is a good measure of the market expectations of the demand for a movie, the
presence of these additional covariates should have no effect on estimates. Panel 1 of Table
6 shows that this is indeed the case.
I report estimates of β2 when surprise is defined as the residual from a regression of first
weekend log sales on the log of number of screens in the opening weekend and a varying
set of controls. The table shows that alternative definitions of surprise yield very similar
estimates of the coefficient β2 . For example, in column 1 surprise is defined as the residual in
a regression of sales on number of screens only. The point estimates are .422 in model 1 and
.672 in model 2. These estimates differ only slightly from the baseline estimates in Table 2,
which are .463 and .616, respectively and are reproduced in column 7. Adding controls for
genre, ratings, production costs and exact time of release also has limited impact. Overall,
it appears that the estimates of β2 are not very sensitive to which controls are included in
the definition of surprise.
As a second check, I investigate whether estimates are sensitive to the addition of controls
in equation 18 (holding fixed the definition of surprise). All time-invariant movie characteristics are fully absorbed in this equation by movie fixed effects, but one might still be
concerned that the rate of decline differs across movies and is correlated with surprise. For
example, one might be concerned that the rate of decline for, say, adventure movies is slow,
and at the same time adventure movies tend to have positive surprises. I do not expect this
to be a likely scenario. If screens are indeed a good measure of market expectations, they
should account for all systematic differences across genres and other movie characteristics.
To address this concern, I investigate whether estimates are sensitive to the inclusion of
an increasing number of film characteristics interacted with time trends
ln yjt = β0 + β1 t + β2 (t × Sj ) + β3 (t × Xj ) + dj + ujt

(20)

where Xj includes genre, ratings, production costs, distributor, and date of the release (year,
month, day of the week); and surprise is based only on number of screens. In this model, any
systematic differences in the rate of decline in sales across different genres, ratings, costs,
distributors and time of release is accounted for.24
Panel 2 of Table 6 indicates that estimates are robust to the inclusion of these additional
controls. For example, the model in column 2 controls for a genre-specific rate of decline in
sales. Identification of β2 arises because surprises vary within genre. The coefficients, .422
24

Note that if I included all the controls in the definition of surprise, then the addition of controls in the
sales equation would have no effect on the coefficient β2 . The reason is that any correlation between controls
and surprise has already been purged the inclusion of controls in the surprise equation.

24

and .671, are remarkably similar to the baseline coefficients. The models in columns 3 to
7 allow the rate of decline to vary depending on ratings, budget, distributor and time of
release. The coefficients do not change significantly.

6.2

Prediction 2: Precision of the Prior

The evidence uncovered so far seems consistent with one of the predictions of the social
learning hypothesis. But if such evidence is indeed explained by social learning, there are
several additional implications that one should see in the data. In the rest of this section
and in the next one, I test four additional implications of the social learning hypothesis.
Prediction 2 indicates that social learning should matter more for movies with a diffuse
prior than for movies with a precise prior. The intuition is simple. When consumers have a
precise prior, they have a good ex-ante idea of whether they might like a movie, irrespective
of what their friends may say. In this case, the new information represented by the first
week surprise should have a limited impact on their choices. When consumers have a diffuse
prior, on the other hand, they only have a vague idea as to whether they will like a movie.
In this case, peer feedback should have a stronger impact on their choices.
To test this prediction, I estimate models of the form
ln yjt = β0 + β1 t + β2 (t × Sj ) + β3 (t × precisionj ) + β4 (t × Sj × precisionj ) + dj + ujt (21)
where precisionj is a measure of the precision of the prior for movie j. The coefficient of
interest is the coefficient on the triple interaction between the time trend, the surprise and
the precision of the prior, β4 , which is predicted to be negative in the presence of social
learning. It is important to note that, unlike equation 18, this model does not compare
movies with positive and negative surprise. Instead, for a given surprise, this model tests
whether the effect of the surprise is systematically associated with precision of the prior.
To empirically identify which movies have precise priors and which have diffuse priors,
I propose two measures. First, I use a dummy for sequels. It is reasonable to expect that
consumers have more precise priors for sequels than non-sequels. For example, after having
seen the movie “Rocky”, consumers are likely to have a more precise idea of whether they
will like its sequel “Rocky II.” Second, to generalize this idea, I calculate the variance of
the first week surprise in box office sales by genre. Genres with large variance in first week
surprise are characterized by more quality uncertainty and therefore consumers should have
more diffuse priors on their quality. Indeed, sequels are the genre with the second smallest
variance in first week surprise.25
Table 7 indicates that the data are consistent with the prediction of the model. In column
1, the coefficient on the triple interaction is negative and statistically significant. Consider
two movies, identical except for the fact that the first is a sequel and the second is not.
Suppose that they both have the same positive surprise in first week sales. The estimates in
25

The genre with the smallest variance is Western. The genre with the largest variance is Action.

25

column 1 implies that the surprise has more impact on the rate of decline of the second than
the first, presumably because the additional information provided by the surprise matters
less for the sequel. Quantitatively, the rate of decline of sales of the second movie implied by
column 1 is -.63, while the rate of decline of the first movie is -.81. In other words, consistent
with the social learning hypothesis, the same positive surprise benefits sales of the second
movie significantly more.
In column 2, I use the variance in first week surprise. In this case, we expect the coefficient
on the triple interaction to be positive, since higher variance means a less precise prior.
Indeed, this is the case empirically.

6.3

Prediction 3: Size of the Social Network

Prediction 3 indicates that social learning should be stronger for consumers who have a
larger social network, since these consumers receive more precise feedback from their peers
than consumers with small social networks. While I do not have direct information on the
size of the social network, it seems plausible to assume that teenagers have a more developed
social network than older adults. Social learning should therefore be more important for
teen movies. To test this prediction, I estimate models of the form
ln yjt = β0 + β1 t + β2 (t × Sj ) + β3 (t × teenj ) + β4 (t × Sj × teenj ) + dj + ujt

(22)

where teenj is an indicator variable for whether the movie’s target audience is teenagers. Here
the coefficient of interest is the coefficient on the triple interaction, β4 , which is predicted to
be positive in the presence of social learning. Like equation 21, this model does not compare
movies with positive and negative surprises. Instead, for a given surprise, this model tests
whether the effect of the surprise is larger for teen movies.
Estimates in column 1 of Table 8 are consistent with Prediction 3. The coefficient on the
triple interaction is indeed positive, indicating that a positive surprise has a larger impact
on rate of decline of sales for teen movies than non-teen movies.
A related approach uses the size of the movie release. The precision of the feedbacks that
consumers receive from friends should be larger for movies opening in many theaters than
for movies opening in few theaters. For example, a positive surprise for a movie that opens
in 2,000 theaters should generate a more precise signal and therefore more updating than an
identically sized surprise for a movie that opens only in 20 theaters. To test this hypothesis,
in column 2 of Table 8 I estimate the following model
ln yjt = β0 + β1 t + β2 (t × Sj ) + β3 (t × screensj ) + β4 (t × Sj × screensj ) + dj + ujt

(23)

where screensj is the number of screens in which the movie opened. The expectation is
that β4 is positive. Consistent with the hypothesis, the coefficient on the triple interaction
in column 2 of Table 8 is positive.

26

6.4

Prediction 4: Does Learning Decline Over Time?

Prediction 4 in section 3 involves the time path of the diffusion of information. It indicates
that in the presence of social learning a positive surprise movie should generate a concave
sales profile, and a negative surprise movie should generate a convex sales profile. To test
this prediction, I estimate the following model:
ln yjt = β0 + β1 t + β2 t2 + β3 (t × 1(Sj > 0)) + β4 (t2 × 1(Sj > 0)) + dj + ujt
where 1(Sj > 0) is a dummy for positive surprise movies. If it is empirically the case
that the sale profile is concave for positive surprise movies, I should find that the second
derivative is negative: 2(β2 + β4 ) < 0. Similarly, if the profile is convex for negative surprise
movies, I should find that the second derivative is positive: 2β2 > 0.
My estimates are indeed consistent with this prediction. Point estimates and standard
errors are as follows: β1 : -1.88 (.051); β2 : .089 (.006); β3 : 1.38 (.060); β4 : -.110 (.007). R2
is .79. Statistical tests confirm that the curvature for positive surprise movies is concave
and the curvature for negative surprise movies is convex. A test of the hypothesis that
2(β2 + β4 ) < 0 has p-value = 0.0001. A test of the hypothesis that 2β2 > 0 also has p-value
= 0.0001.

7

Alternative Interpretations

Overall, the evidence in the previous section is consistent with the hypothesis that the
diffusion of information through social learning significantly affects consumers’ purchasing
decisions. The rate of decline of sales for movies with positive surprise is much slower than
the rate of decline of movies with negative surprise. This finding does not appear to be driven
only by omitted variables. For example, this finding is not due to endogenous changes in
advertising expenditures or critic reviews in the weeks after the opening. Similarly, this
finding cannot be explained by endogenous changes in the number of screens devoted to a
movie, because it is robust to using per-screen sales as the dependent variable instead of
sales.
Moreover, if this finding were only due to omitted variables, we would not necessarily
observe the comparative static results based on precision of the prior and size of the social
network. The effect of a surprise appears more pronounced when consumers have diffuse
priors on movie quality and less pronounced when consumers have strong priors, as in the
case of sequels. The effect of a surprise is also larger for movies that target audiences with
larger social networks. Moreover, the amount of learning appears to decline over time. This
fact is also consistent with the social learning hypothesis.
In this Section, I discuss three possible alternative explanations of the evidence. First, I
discuss the possibility that the utility of watching a movie depends on the number of peers
who have seen the movie. This type of network effect may occur if, for example, consumers
draw utility from talking about a movie with their friends, and that utility is increasing in
27

the number of friends who have seen the movie.26 I use prediction 5 to shed some light
on the importance of network effects. Second, I discuss whether the finding that positive
surprise movies experience a slower rate of decline in sales than negative surprise movies
may be explained by delayed consumer responses. Finally, I discuss the role of competitors.
Network Effects and Prediction 5. It is very difficult to distinguish social learning
from the case where a consumer’s utility of watching a movie depends both on the quality
of the movie and on the number of peers who have seen the movie or plan to see the movie.
Consider for example the evidence in Table 2. A movie with a positive surprise in week 1
may attract more viewers in week 2 not because of learning, but because marginal consumers
in week 2 realize that a larger than expected number of their friends have seen the movie,
making the movie more valuable to them. Moreover, if utility of watching a movie is a
function of the expected number of friends who will ever see the movie, the network effects
story is consistent not only with Table 2 but also with the comparative statics in sub-section
6.2. A consumer who uses the normal learning model to update her predictions on how many
peers will ever see the movie should be more affected by a surprise in week 1 when she has
a diffuse prior relative to the case when she has a precise prior.
This alternative interpretation is difficult to distinguish from social learning, and I cannot
completely rule it out. However, I provide a simple test based on Prediction 5 in Section
3 that sheds some light on the relevance of this interpretation. Specifically, I test whether
consumers respond to surprises in first week sales that are orthogonal to movie quality, like
weather shocks. Under social learning, lower than expected demand in week 1 due to bad
weather should have no significant impact on sales in the following weeks, because demand
shocks driven by weather do not reflect movie quality. On the other hand, under the network
effects hypothesis, lower than expected demand in week one caused by bad weather should
still lower sales in the following weeks. If a consumer draws utility from talking about a
movie with friends, she cares about how many friends have seen a movie, irrespective of
their reasons for choosing to see it.
To implement this test, I estimate equation 18 by 2SLS, where I instrument Sj using
weather in the opening weekend. By using weather as an instrument, I isolate the variation
in surprise that only comes from weather shocks. This variation is arguably independent of
the quality of a movie. The coefficient of interest is β2 . The network hypothesis predicts
that β2 > 0. By contrast, the social learning hypothesis predicts that β2 = 0.
A major limitation of my data is that it only includes information on nation-wide sales.
However, as it turns out, it is possible to predict first week surprise at the national level
using weather conditions in 7 large cities: New York, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Atlanta,
26

Becker (1991) proposes a model of network effects where the demand for a good by a person depends
positively on the aggregate quantity demanded of the good. He hypothesizes that “the pleasure from some
goods is greater when many people want to consume it.”

28

Kansans City and Detroit.27 In general, rain, snow and colder temperatures in these 7 cities
are associated with significantly lower first week demand and significantly lower first week
surprise.
Results are shown in Table 9. The first row corresponds to a specification where Sj is the
surprise of movie j, while the second row corresponds to a specification where Sj is a dummy
for whether the surprise of movie j is positive. Column 1 reports the baseline OLS estimates
for the sample for which I have non-missing temperature data for all 7 cities. These estimates
are very similar to the corresponding estimates for the full sample. Column 2 reports instrumental variables estimates where instruments include minimum and maximum temperature
on the opening day and the day before the opening day. It is possible that the effect of
temperature is nonlinear. For example, when it is cold, we expect higher temperatures to
be associated with higher sales, but when it is hot, we expect higher temperatures to lower
sales. For this reason, in column 3 instruments also include the squares of minimum and
maximum temperature on the opening day and the day before. In column 4, instruments
include minimum and maximum temperature as well as precipitation and snowfall on the
opening day and the day before. In column 5, instruments include minimum and maximum
temperature, precipitation, and snowfall, on the opening day and the day before, as well
as these variables squared. Surprise is defined as the deviation of sales from expected sales
based on number of screens. The last row in Table 9 corresponds to a test of whether the
weather variables are jointly significant in the first stage. While only some of the first stage
coefficients are individually significant, taken together they are statistically significant. Tests
for whether the first stage coefficients are jointly equal to 0 have p-values below 0.0001 in
all 4 columns, although the F test statistics are low.
Comparison of columns 1 and 2 indicates that the coefficient on the surprise×t interaction
drops from .413 to -.107, while the coefficient on the positive surprise dummy×t interaction
drops from .643 to -.277. The corresponding coefficients in column 2 are .085 and .123 and
are not statistically significant. Column 3 and 4 display similar results. Not surprisingly,
the IV estimates are considerably less precise than the OLS estimates, most likely because
I can not perform the analysis at the city-level. For this reason it is difficult to draw firm
conclusions. However, the small, insignificant and often wrong-signed point estimates in
columns 2-5 suggest that network effects cannot fully explain the large effects documented
in Table 2.
One concern is that weather might be serially correlated. Because my measure of sales
is for the weekend, this is unlikely to be a serious concern. Indeed, when I measure serial
correlation in temperature, snow or precipitation in my 7 cities, I find that weather is not
correlated with weather 7 days earlier.28
27

Dahl and Della Vigna (2007) are the first to document that weather in selected cities shifts aggregate
movie sales.
28
Positive serial correlation would induce a positive bias into IV estimates, biasing the test in favor of the
network hypothesis.

29

Delayed Consumer Response. It is in theory possible that the patterns in Table 2 are
explained by a slow adjustment of consumers to the innovation represented by the surprise.
Consider for example a positive surprise movie, and assume that there is a fraction of consumers who cannot immediately go when a new movie is released but have already decided
to see the film in later weeks. In this case the positive surprise movie would experience a
slower rate of decline in sales even in the absence of social learning.
However, while this explanation could in theory generate the patterns documented in
Table 2, it is not consistent with the comparative statics on precision of the prior and the
signal documented below in sub-sections 6.2 and 6.3. In the absence of social learning there
is no reason why we should see that the effect of the surprise is systematically associated
with the precision of the prior or the size of the social network.
Competitors. Movies rarely open alone. Often there are 2 or 3 movies opening in the
same weekend. As documented by Einav (2003 and 2007), the competitors a movie faces are
not random, but are determined strategically by the studios. The fact that competitors are
not random does not pose a problem for my estimation. The number of screens allocated
to a given movie should incorporate the best prediction of demand given its competitors.
A movie facing a competitor that is expected to be strong will have a smaller number of
screens than a movie facing a competitor expected to be weak. Thus, while competitors are
not random, the deviation from market expectations is arguably random.
One might still be concerned that a positive surprise competitor might mechanically
induce a negative surprise for a given movie. While this is likely, this mechanism alone
would not generate the increased divergence in sales over time between positive surprise
movies and negative surprise movies documented in section 6. It would simply result in
a parallel shift in sales, without necessarily affecting the rate of decline. Moreover, this
mechanism alone would not generate the comparative statics in sections 6.2 and 6.3.

Discussion and Conclusion

This paper makes two contributions. Substantively, I show that social learning is an
important determinant of sales in the movie industry. Social learning makes successful movies
more successful and unsuccessful movies more unsuccessful. Consistent with a simple model
where consumers update their priors based on their peers’ purchasing decisions, the rate of
decline of movies with stronger than expected first week demand is about half the rate of
decline of movies with weaker than expected first week demand.
While I cannot completely rule out alternative explanations, the weight of the evidence
is consistent with the social learning hypothesis. As the model predicts, the effect of a
surprise on subsequent sales is smaller for movies for which consumers have strong priors
and larger for movies for which consumers have more diffuse priors. Additionally, the effect

30

of a surprise is more pronounced for groups of consumers who have more developed social
networks. Finally, consumers do not seem to respond to surprises caused by factors that are
orthogonal to movie quality, like weather shocks.
Quantitatively, social learning appears to have an important effect on profits in the
movie industry. When I use my estimates to quantify the amount of sales generated by
social learning, I find that for the typical movie with positive surprise, social learning raises
box-office sales by $5.8 million–or about 38% of total revenues–relative to the case of a movie
that has similar quality but where consumers do not communicate.29 The existence of this
large “social multiplier” indicates that the elasticity of aggregate movie demand to movie
quality is significantly larger than the elasticity of individual demand to quality.
The second contribution of the paper is methodological. This paper shows that it is possible to identify social interactions using aggregate data and intuitive comparative statics. In
situations where individual-level data and exogenous variation in peer group attributes are
not available, this approach is a credible alternative methodology for identifying spillovers
and social interactions. For example, this approach can be applied to the study of informational spillovers in the demand of many other goods or in technology adoption.

29

This number is obtained as follows. Equation 18 indicates that over the lifetime of a movie, the effect
P8
of a positive surprise on sales is t=2 βˆ2 S t salest , where the summation does not include the first week
(t=1), as learning begins only after the opening week; βˆ2 = .463 is the coefficient in column 2 of Table 2;
salest represents average sales in week t for a movie with no surprise; and S represents the surprise for the
typical positive or negative surprise movie. (For simplicity, in these calculations I ignore the non-linearity
uncovered in subsection 6.4.) For the typical positive surprise movie–that is, the one at the 75 th percentile
of the surprise distribution, with sales 46% above expectations–social learning accounts for $5.8 million in
additional sales. For the typical negative surprise movie–that is, the one at the 25 th percentile of the surprise
distribution, with sales 41% below expectations–social learning accounts for $5.2 million in lost sales.

Notes: Standard errors are clustered by movie and displayed in parentheses. The dependent
variable is log weekly box office sales. Columns 1 and 2 report baseline estimates (reproduced
from columns 2 and 3 of Table 2). Columns 3 and 4 report estimates of the same models
obtained using the sample for which data on advertising (top panel) or movie reviews (bottom
panel) are available. Columns 5 and 6 include controls for advertising (top panel) and reviews
(bottom panel) and are based on the same sample used for columns 3 and 4. Log TV
advertising is the logarithm of cumulative expenditures for all television ads (network, cable
and others) until the relevant week. Favorable reviews is the fraction of positive reviews
among all the reviews published until the relevant week. All models include movie fixed
effects.

Notes: Standard errors are clustered by movie and displayed in parentheses. Each entry is a separate
regression. In panel 1, each entry is an estimate of the parameter β2 in equation 18, where the definition of
surprises varies across columns. Surprise refers to deviation from predicted first week sales, where predicted
first week sales are obtained using the number of screens as a predictor and an increasing number of controls,
as specified at the bottom of the panel. Column 7 reports baseline estimates from the definition of surprise
used in Table 2. Panel 2 reports estimates of equation 20, where an increasing number of controls are added
to the sales equation, as specified at the bottom of the panel. In
40this panel, surprise is defined using only
the number of screens as predictor. All models include movie fixed effects. Sample size is 39,936.

Notes: Standard errors are clustered by movie and displayed in parentheses. Each column
reports estimates of variants of equation 21. The dependent variable is log weekly box
office sales. In column 1, precision of the prior is measured by sequel status. Movies that
are sequels are expected to have more precise priors. In column 2, precision of the prior
is measured by the variance of the first weekend surprise in box office sales. Genres with
a larger variance are expected to have less precise priors. All models include movie fixed
effects. Sample size is 39,936.

Notes: Standard errors are clustered by movie and displayed in parentheses. The dependent
variable is log weekly box office sales. Column 1 reports an estimate of equation 22, where
“Teen Movie” is an indicator equal to one if the intended audience is teenagers, based on
detailed genre. Teenagers are expected to have a larger social network and therefore more
social learning. Column 2 reports an estimate of equation 23, where “Screens” is the number
of screens in the opening weekend. Movies with a larger number of screens are expected to
send a more precise signal. Number of screens is divided by 1,000 to make the reported
coefficients easier to read. All models include movie fixed effects. Sample size is 39,936.

Notes: Standard errors are clustered by movie and displayed in parentheses. Each entry is a separate regression and represents an
estimate of the parameter β2 in equation 18. The dependent variable is log weekly box office sales. Column 1 reports OLS estimates
based on the sample for which I have data on maximum and minimum temperature. Column 2 reports instrumental variables estimates
where instruments include minimum and maximum temperature on the opening day and the day before the opening day in 7 metropolitan
areas. In column 3, instruments include minimum and maximum temperature on the opening day and the day before the opening day
as well as these variables squared. In column 4, instruments include minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation and snowfall
on the opening day and the day before the opening day. In column 5, instruments include minimum and maximum temperature,
precipitation and snowfall on the opening day and the day before the opening day as well as these variables squared. Surprise is defined
based on number of screens. Sample size varies because data on weather are missing for some cities in some days.
