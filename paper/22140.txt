ABSTRACT
The effects of supply-side policies in depressed economies are controversial. We shed light on
this debate using evidence from France in the 1930s. In 1936, France departed from the gold
standard and implemented mandatory wage increases and hours restrictions. Deflation ended but
output stagnated. We present time-series and cross-sectional evidence that these supply-side
policies, in particular the 40-hour law, contributed to French stagflation. These results are
inconsistent both with the standard one-sector new Keynesian model and with a medium scale,
multi-sector model calibrated to match our cross-sectional estimates. We conclude that the new
Keynesian model is a poor guide to the effects of supply-side shocks in depressed economies.

1 Introduction
The output effects of supply-side policies in depressed economies are controversial. Much
of the debate has focused on the U.S. New Deal’s supply-side elements, in particular the
National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA).1 Standard new Keynesian models used for policy
analysis imply that the NIRA ought to have been expansionary given economic conditions
during the Great Depression (Eggertsson, 2012), but many economists have suggested otherwise (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963; Bordo, Erceg, and Evans, 2000; Cole and Ohanian,
2004). More recently, this debate has resurfaced in the context of whether structural reforms
would be helpful or harmful for the Eurozone periphery (e.g., Bundick, 2014; Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Raffo, 2014; Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, and Rubio-Ramírez, 2014;
Lo and Rogoff, 2015).
In this paper, we use the French experience in the mid 1930s to shed light on this debate.
Elected in May 1936 and led by Léon Blum, the Popular Front government in France enacted
a suite of supply-side policies that combined were a sort of NIRA on steroids. The Matignon
agreements in June 1936 raised private sector wages by 7% to 15%. Workers were granted
two weeks of vacation without loss of pay. And perhaps most importantly, the work week
was restricted to 40 hours, also without loss of pay. The size of these shocks as well as
their temporal isolation from demand-side policies make France from 1936 to 1938 a useful
setting for understanding the effects of supply-side policies in depressed economies. The
large increase in inflation that followed the Popular Front’s election also makes this episode
a useful test of the new Keynesian model’s prediction that higher expected inflation and
lower ex ante real interest rates raise output (Dupor and Li, 2013; Wieland, 2015).
We present cross-sectional and time-series evidence that French wage and hour restrictions, in particular the 40-hour work week, contributed to the lack of French recovery from

For a general overview of the New Deal, including its supply-side elements, see Fishback (2008). The
NIRA consisted of two distinct sections. The first section established the National Recovery Administration,
which encouraged price and wage increases. The second section established the Public Works Administration.
Following the convention in much of the literature, by “NIRA” we mean only the first section of the bill, the
part restricting supply (the National Recovery Administration). A substantial literature also documents that
the monetary and fiscal policy elements of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal promoted recovery: on monetary
policy, see Temin and Wigmore (1990), Romer (1992), and Eggertsson (2008); on fiscal policy, see Fishback
and Kachanovskaya (2015) and Hausman (2014). For a view of U.S. recovery that does not emphasize
aggregate demand policies, see Cole and Ohanian (2004).

the Great Depression. First, we show that price increases and output declines coincided
with the implementation of supply-side restrictions. Second, by exploiting variation in the
implementation date of the 40-hour law across industries, we show that it lowered output
and raised prices. Third, we consider the possibility that the 40-hour law was contractionary
in the cross-section but expansionary in the aggregate, as implied by standard new Keynesian models. We analyze the effect of the 40-hour law in a medium-scale new Keynesian
model calibrated to match our cross-sectional output estimates. Due to the large increase
in expected inflation and decline in ex ante real interest rates caused by the 40-hour law,
the model predicts an implausible doubling of output. The model’s inability to match the
aggregate French data is evidence that the new Keynesian model is a poor guide to the
effects of supply-side policies in depressed economies.
In the next section we show that French movements in prices and output coincided with
government actions. French prices started to rise as soon as the Popular Front government
was elected in May 1936, and they rose faster after France left the gold standard in September
1936. Output initially fell after the Popular Front government took office, but then rose after
France devalued. As the 40-hour week restriction took full effect, output fell again.
In section 3, we obtain further evidence on the effects of the 40-hour law from the industry
cross-section. Our identification strategy uses cross-industry variation in when the 40-hour
law took effect. The implementation across industries was staggered in part for technical
reasons, such as the need to conduct working-place surveys. This implies that the timing
variation was at least in part exogenous to contemporaneous industry-specific conditions. We
combine this information with monthly industry-level production data from Sauvy (1937),
Sauvy and Magnin (1939) and Statistique Générale (1941), and we find that the 40-hour
law reduced output on impact by roughly 5 percent. The cumulative effect may have been
as much as 15%. These results are robust across a variety of different specifications and
industry samples. We use a similar strategy to study the effect of the 40-hour law on prices.
In our preferred specification, the immediate effect of the 40-hour law was to raise prices by
5-6%.
While our cross-sectional estimates provide direct evidence that the 40-hour law was
contractionary at the industry-level, they do not directly rule out expansionary general equi2

librium effects. General equilibrium effects are the basis for the new Keynesian model’s
prediction that an hours restriction is expansionary with fixed nominal interest rates. To
assess whether such general-equilibrium effects are plausible, we follow Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) and calibrate a medium-scale, multi-sector new Keynesian model to match the
cross-sectional evidence. The model draws on existing medium-scale models such as Smets
and Wouters (2007) with two new features to match the French data: first, firms optimally
employ workers for 48 hours a week, but are restricted to a 40-hour work-week when the
40-hour law is implemented. As in the data, the implementation of the 40-hour law is
staggered across industries. Second, the central bank follows a fixed nominal interest rate
policy. We show that to replicate our cross-sectional regression results in the model requires
fairly flexible prices (an average duration of four months) and fully-flexible wages. Thus as in
Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), our empirical work is informative about general-equilibrium
effects because it narrows the plausible parameter-space.
With this parameterization of price and wage stickiness in the model, the 40-hour law
more than doubles the level of output. The increase in the marginal cost of production
from the hours restriction causes firms to gradually raise their prices, ultimately more than
doubling the price level. Consumers and firms thus anticipate substantial inflation, which
given fixed nominal interest rates means low ex ante real interest rates. The resulting
stimulus to consumption and investment leads to the large predicted increase in output.
Put differently, because the 40-hour law is so successful at generating expected inflation
and lowering ex ante real interest rates, the model predicts it should have lifted the French
economy out of depression and generated an unprecedented boom.
The model’s prediction of output doubling is implausibly large given the French data.
Therefore, in section 5 we consider possible sources of the disconnect between the new
Keynesian prediction and the data, such as political uncertainty, capital flight, and ongoing
strikes. While an evaluation of these factors is necessarily uncertain, we argue that none
can resolve the disconnect between the model’s predictions and the data. Thus we conclude
that the standard new Keynesian model exaggerates the benefits of restrictive supply-side
policies.
We wish to emphasize that our paper’s concern is with the output effects of France’s
3

supply-side policies, not with their welfare effects. A full cost-benefit analysis of the Popular
Front’s policies would need to assess their distributional consequences (Kalecki, 1938) and
include some consideration of what, if any, politically viable alternatives existed in the
dangerous political climate of 1936. Such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.
This paper relates to several distinct literatures. First, it contributes to our understanding
of France’s economic stagnation after 1936. Our analysis broadly confirms the hypothesis
in some of the literature, in particular Eichengreen (1992), that the benefits of devaluation
in France were nullified by the Popular Front’s supply-side policies.2 We add to this prior
literature by providing econometric evidence on the effects of the 40-hour law and by showing
that the French experience does not fit with the standard new Keynesian model.
In contrast to a small English language literature on the Popular Front’s policies, there is
a large literature on the supply-side elements of the U.S. New Deal, in particular the NIRA.
Eggertsson (2012) argues that raising prices and wages through supply-side measures helped
end deflation and lower real interest rates and was thus critical to lifting the U.S. economy
out of the Depression. By contrast, Bordo et al. (2000) and Cole and Ohanian (2004) argue
that these anti-competitive measures had contractionary effects by raising real wages and
restricting supply. Their models, however, cannot rationalize why supply-side policies would
be contractionary if, as in France, the supply-side policies cause a large reduction in real
interest rates. We show that a conventional new Keynesian model can replicate the large
reduction in real interest rates, but then also generates an implausibly large expansion.
Thus, the sluggish performance of the French economy is puzzling from the perspective of
this standard macroeconomic model.
Within the empirical literature on supply-side elements of the New Deal, our work is
most directly related to Taylor (2011) and Neumann, Taylor, and Fishback (2013). They
argue that voluntary hours restrictions associated with the NIRA reduced U.S. output in late
1933. The French context has the advantage that hours’ restrictions were mandatory and
came with exogenous variation across industries. Our quasi-experimental evidence that the
40-hour law reduced French output supports the view that the NIRA reduced U.S. output.
This suggests that rapid U.S. growth after 1933 may have occurred despite, and not because,

This is also the view of Marjolin (1938), Sauvy (1984), and Villa (1991), among others.

of the NIRA, a conclusion in line with the literature that stresses the importance of monetary
policy in the recovery from the Great Depression (e.g., Eichengreen and Sachs, 1985, Romer,
1992, Eggertsson, 2008).
Fourth, our results relate to a current debate (in 2016) about the usefulness of structural
reforms in the depressed countries of the Eurozone periphery. Our results accord with those in
Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2014) and Bundick (2014), who suggest that structural reforms
raise output and that restricting aggregate supply is counter-productive. As in Eggertsson
et al. (2014) (their figure 8), in our medium-scale new Keynesian model, efficiency-increasing
structural reforms substantially reduce output when nominal interest rates are fixed.3 However, because the new Keynesian model predicts an implausibly large expansion from the
40-hour law, we conclude that it exaggerates both the expansionary benefits of supply-side
restrictions and the contractionary effects of supply-side reforms.
Fifth, since the zero lower bound is an important constraint on many central banks today,
there is a renewed interest among academics and policymakers in the potentially positive
effects of higher expected inflation. For instance, the hope that higher expected inflation will
promote recovery has motivated current Japanese monetary policy (“Abenomics”) (Hausman
and Wieland, 2014). The standard new Keynesian model provides a justification for such
policies, since the model implies that raising inflation expectations when nominal interest
rates are fixed is expansionary. In this paper, however, we add to the empirical evidence in
Wieland (2015) that the new Keynesian model’s depiction of the benefits of higher expected
inflation may be simplistic; demand-side policies that raise inflation expectations may be
expansionary, but it need not follow that supply-side policies that raise inflation expectations
are as well. Relative to Wieland (2015) we show that even during the Great Depression,
when one may have most expected positive effects from expected inflation, supply shocks
that raised inflation expectations appear to have been contractionary.4

3

Indeed, our parameterization implies an even larger negative effect of structural reforms than that in
Eggertsson et al. (2014), because we require very flexible prices and wages to match our cross-sectional
estimates. This amplifies the contractionary effect of supply-side reforms in depressed economies as stressed
in Eggertsson and Krugman (2011) and Werning (2011).
4
While some have argued (e.g. Swanson and Williams (2014)) that the zero lower bound posed only a
weak constraint on (U.S.) monetary policy during most of the Great Recession after 2007, it is almost certain
that monetary policy was constrained during the Great Depression.

2 The Great Depression and the Popular Front
The Great Depression in France lasted 7 years.5 Figure 1a shows the path of real GDP and
industrial production in France from 1928 to 1938. Real GDP declined almost continuously
from 1930 to 1936; the cumulative decline was 15% (Villa data, series PIBVOL). Industrial
production moved somewhat more erratically and bottomed out in 1935. Prices also fell.
Figure 1b shows inflation rates for three price indexes: an index for all wholesale prices, an
index for wholesale prices of domestic products, and an index of the cost-of-living. All three
indexes declined rapidly from 1929 to 1935. Cumulative deflation as measured by wholesale
prices was 44% (Mitchell, 1980).
Given the policies followed, the behavior of prices and output before 1936 is unsurprising.
France’s adherence to the gold standard until September 1936 inevitably prevented substantial expansionary policies. Even worse, when France experienced gold inflows, it did not
allow the influx of gold to expand the money supply (Irwin, 2012). Thus, from December
1930 to December 1935, the French money supply (M2) declined 14% (Patat and Lutfalla,
1990, table A.2).
As in many countries, the severity and duration of the Depression in France led to political
instability and extremism (de Bromhead, Eichengreen, and O’Rourke, 2013). Between 1929
and 1934, France had twelve prime ministers. Quasi-paramilitary fascist ‘leagues’ became
popular.6 On February 6, 1934, a large right-wing street demonstration turned violent, with
gunfire exchanged between demonstrators and police. Fifteen people died and over 1400
were injured. This event precipitated the unification of France’s three left-wing parties (the
Radicals, the Socialists, and the Communists) into the so-called Popular Front. The Popular
Front’s political popularity was aided by moderate prime minister Pierre Laval’s deflationary
policies.
Against this background, the Popular Front decisively won the May 1936 parliamentary
elections. Inspired workers responded with an unprecedented wave of strikes.7 In June 1936,

there were over 12,000 strikes and 1.8 million strikers (out of a total French population of 41
million). The cause of these strikes continues to be debated. Prost (2002) and Jackson (1988)
emphasize the difficult working conditions in French factories. In any case, these strikes were
perhaps the most direct cause of the Popular Front’s radical supply-side policies. For a time
in early June 1936, the scale of the strikes led many to fear or hope for a revolution (Trotsky,
1968, p. 6).
More important than their immediate effects on output, the May and June strikes pushed
the Popular Front to quickly enact measures in support of labor. The Matignon agreements of
June 7, 1936 raised private sector wages by 7% to 15% (Sauvy, 1984). Almost immediately
thereafter, the government passed a series of laws codifying collective bargaining rights,
granting workers two weeks of paid vacation, and reducing the work week from 48 to 40
hours, all while holding weekly pay constant (Bernard and Dubief, 1988; Asselain, 1974).
The 40-hour week restriction was implemented only gradually, a fact we exploit in our
econometric work below. When its implementation was complete, the 40-hour law applied
throughout the manufacturing and service sectors.
These policies were both politically popular and were a logical response to the French
socialist party’s (the SFIO’s) understanding of the Great Depression (Bernard and Dubief,
1988; Mouré, 1991; Jackson, 1988; Margairaz, 1991). Blum’s government hoped that higher
purchasing power and more leisure time would raise consumption demand. Higher demand
would then lower prices by allowing firms to exploit economies of scale and move along a
downward sloping supply curve. Lower prices would promote exports, loosening the external
constraint and avoiding the need for devaluation (Bernard and Dubief, 1988; Margairaz,
1991). Cutting the work week from 48 to 40 hours with unchanged weekly wages (20% higher
hourly wages) had the further hoped-for advantage of forcing firms to increase employment
to maintain production, thus reducing the number of unemployed.
Events did not unfold as the Popular Front hoped. Figure 2a shows the actual path of
monthly nominal and real wages from 1935 to 1938. The first vertical line indicates the
election of the Popular Front in May 1936. Nominal wages were roughly constant before the
Popular Front’s election.8 As desired, the Popular Front’s policies then led both nominal and

The extreme flatness in 1935 and the first half of 1936 is due to interpolation (Sauvy and Depoid, 1940).

real wages to rise. Unlike Roosevelt’s NIRA, the Popular Front’s high wage policies were not
accompanied by parallel efforts to raise prices.9 This followed from the desire to raise real
wages while at the same time lowering prices. Indeed, though ineffectual, the Popular Front
introduced price controls in August 1936. But prices behaved as one would expect if supply
curves slope up, not down: prices rose in parallel with wages, such that real wages rose less
than nominal wages. Still, deflated by wholesale prices, real wages rose 4% from May 1936
to May 1937; deflated by consumer prices, they rose 21%.10 Kalecki (1938) ascribes this real
wage increase to the stickiness of housing rents and food prices.

2.1 Devaluation Devaluation was an unpopular prospect, and the Popular Front hoped to
ignite recovery without it.11 However, the Blum government soon faced a choice between
its expansionary objectives and its commitment to an overvalued Franc. Under pressure
from the government, between June 23 and July 9, 1936 the Bank of France lowered its
discount rate from 6% to 3% (Mouré, 1991). This was not accompanied by a large increase
in the money supply. Nonetheless, combined with higher French prices, a lower discount
rate inevitably led to pressure on the Bank of France’s gold reserves. Reserves fell from 117
million fine ounces in April 1936 to 95 million fine ounces in September (Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (1943), table 160, p. 547). Faced with the choice between
adopting deflationary policies and devaluing, France left the gold standard on September 26.
To make devaluation more politically palatable, it came under the guise of the Tripartite
Agreement, in which Britain, France, and the U.S. publicly committed themselves to avoid
(future) competitive devaluations (Eichengreen, 1992; Jackson, 1988; Margairaz, 1991).
With the external constraint removed, a rapid monetary expansion began (figure 3a). The
departure from monetary orthodoxy was accompanied by and in part caused by a departure
from fiscal orthodoxy. From 1935 to 1937, the budget deficit as a share of GDP rose from
9

An exception was the price of wheat, which was fixed at a high level by the newly created Office National
Interprofessionnel du Blé (Bernard and Dubief, 1988).

In the 12 months after March 1933, the respective figures in the U.S. are 0 percent and 16 percent.
These figures are for U.S. nominal hourly earnings in manufacturing deflated by, respectively, the PPI and
the CPI (FRED series M08142USM055NNBR, PPIACO, and CPIAUCNS).
11
Despite its public opposition to devaluation through the summer of 1936, more astute members of the
government, probably including Léon Blum, recognized that devaluation would be beneficial. The problem
was French popular opinion (Jackson, 1988; Margairaz, 1991).

4.0% to 6.3%.12 Much of this increase was financed by advances from the Bank of France
(Mouré, 2002).
Initially, devaluation and the ensuing money supply growth led to a significant recovery.
Figure 3b shows the behavior of monthly, seasonally adjusted industrial production from
1935 through 1938. Production fell during the first months of the Blum government, perhaps because of strike related disruptions as well as forced wage increases and paid vacation.
Seasonally adjusted industrial production then rose 12% in the nine months following devaluation (the second vertical line). Other series show similar improvements. The seasonally
adjusted number of unemployed fell from 448 thousand in August 1936 to 340 thousand in
June 1937.13 And four-quarter growth in new car sales increased from 18 percent in the
second quarter of 1936 to 45 percent in the fourth (Statistique Générale (1941), p. 160).
2.2 Implementation of the 40-hour law The expansion that followed devaluation was
short-lived. After June 1937, industrial production fell back to its pre-devaluation level
(figure 3b). Unemployment also rose, though it remained below its early 1936 level. In contrast to the volatile path of output, wages and prices rose steadily, reversing the continuous
deflation during the depression. All prices indexes show rapid inflation in 1936 and 1937
(figure 1b). This increase in inflation was not accompanied by a significant change in nominal interest rates. Figure 4 displays three nominal interest rates: the 45-90 day commercial
paper rate, the average yield on 36 bonds, and the yield on 3% government consols. From
1936 to 1938, all fluctuate in a narrow range with little notable trend.
The coincidence of large increases in inflation and steady nominal rates meant a large
decline in ex post real interest rates. Deflated by wholesale prices, the ex post real commercial
paper rate declined from +3.0% in December 1935 to -23.0% in September 1936, and -46.3%
in September 1937. Thereafter real interest rates rose as inflation moderated. But in absolute
value, real interest rates remained very low, below -10 percent, until the summer of 1938.
Of course, what is relevant for economic activity is the ex ante real rate, which depends

than actual French labor market tightness (Salais, 1988).

on expected inflation. We do not directly observe expected inflation, but reports of contemporary observers suggest that the direction and the order of magnitude of price changes were
expected. Already in May 1936, the authors of L’Observation Économique worried about
the degree of pass-through from higher costs to higher prices.14 In June 1936, they concluded
that “consumers will inevitably face higher prices soon.” In the following months, they expressed similar expectations of price increases, but with growing confidence. They wrote,
for example, that “simple economic logic suggests that the current drivers of price increases
will continue to act in the same direction.” These observations imply an understanding that
supply curves slope up, and that expected inflation moves together with actual inflation.
La Conjoncture Économique et Financière also indicates that the magnitude of the change
was anticipated. In July 1936, the author expected the increase in the wholesale price index

to be between 15 and 20%. In September 1936, the author worried that wholesale price
inflation could eventually reach 50%. This narrative evidence from leading French research
institutes leads us to believe that expected inflation significantly rose, and thus that ex ante
real interest rates significantly fell.15
As already noted, despite low real interest rates, output began to fall in summer 1937.
The timing suggests a role for the 40-hour law. Figure 5 graphs a measure of hours worked
based on reports from a selection of establishments with more than 100 employees. The
measure is not ideal, since part of the change after the 40-hour law began to bind may be
due to a change in firm reporting requirements.16 Still, the series conveys a striking message.
15

This contrasts with France’s experience during the French Revolution, when in the mid 1790s high
inflation coexisted with incorrect expectations of imminent monetary stabilization (White, 1995). While it
is possible that a similar dynamic was present under the Popular Front, we have seen no evidence suggesting
this. Certainly there was no event calculated to lower inflation expectations equivalent to the February 1796
burning of the printing presses described by White (1995).
16
Huber (1944), p. 182 explains that before the 40-hour law, hours worked were computed based on reports
from firms stating whether their workers worked: (1) more than 48 hours; (2) between 40 and 48 hours; (3)
exactly 40 hours; (4) between 32 and 40 hours; (5) exactly 32 hours; (6) less than 32 hours. Unfortunately,

14

It suggests that the 40-hour law was binding. Average hours worked fell quickly when the
40-hour law began to take effect in November 1936 (the first vertical line). As we discuss
further below, in November 1938, the 40-hour law was relaxed. This is indicated by the
second vertical line. The relaxation of the law was followed by a rapid increase in hours
worked. The graph also suggests a correlation between hours and production: the end of
industrial production growth in June 1937 coincides with the complete implementation of
the 40-hour law, while the resumption of industrial production growth in late 1938 coincides
with the relaxation of the law.
Putting aside its cause, the relatively poor performance of the French economy under
the Popular Front had political consequences.17 In June 1937, as capital flight put renewed
pressure on the Franc, Léon Blum asked for emergency powers. These were denied and he
resigned. After Blum’s resignation in June 1937, several governments fell in rapid succession
until the formation of a government led by Édouard Daladier on April 10, 1938. Daladier
gradually shifted economic policy to the right, culminating in the relaxation of the 40-hour
law in November 1938.18

3 Panel regression evidence
The time series discussed in the previous section suggest that the application of the 40hour week law cut short France’s recovery after devaluation. To more precisely identify the
effect of the 40-hour restriction, we use variation in the timing of the laws’ application across
different industries. We use data on when the law came into effect as well as data on actual
hours worked, monthly industrial production, and prices.

3.1 Data Since to our knowledge, we are the first to use these data for econometric analysis,
we begin with a detailed description of the decree date, production, and price data.
after an establishment fell under the 40-hour law, the first three categories were collapsed to one.
17
This paragraph draws on Jackson (1988).
18
Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify the effects of this reversal of the 40-hour law, since it occurred
simultaneously across all industries, and since it was followed within a year by the outbreak of war.

15

3.1.1 Application dates of the 40-hour restriction We obtain data on when the 40hour law began to bind from the original source, so-called “application decrees” as published
in the Journal Officiel.19 The National Archives inventory “Les Lois sur la Durée du Travail
Conservées aux Archives Nationales” (Archives Nationales, 2003) organizes these decrees by
industry and by dates of publication in the Journal Officiel. 47 industries are covered by
these application decrees.
To learn when the 40-hour law came into effect in each industry, we read the application
decrees as published in the Journal Officiel.20 For most industries, the law came into effect
on a specific day. But for others, the law took effect gradually. In these cases, we chose the
first day of application as the start date in our empirical specification.
3.1.2 Industrial production data We use industrial production data constructed by the
Statistique Générale de la France under the leadership of Alfred Sauvy in 1937. The aggregate index is based on 43 monthly series.21 These series are grouped into 10 sectoral indexes.
For instance, the index of mining output is a weighted average of the production indexes for
coal, metal, potash, oil, bauxite, and salt extraction.
We use three publications to recover as many series as possible, to understand how the
data were constructed, and to conduct checks. Sauvy (1937) is the first article presenting
this new index. The data published in this article cover only 1936 and 1937, but the article
carefully details the construction of the index. Sauvy and Magnin (1939) is an extension
of Sauvy (1937) and provides monthly production data for 1928 to 1939. For industries
for which monthly production data are unavailable for the 1928-1935 period, the monthly
19
Sauvy (1984), v. 1, p. 283 reports dates of the 40-hour law’s application for some industries, but not
for a sufficient number to permit a quantitative analysis. In addition, Sauvy (1984), vol. 1, p. 287 uses a
much smaller sample to perform an informal version of our regressions below. He looks at data on industrial
production in some industries, and notes—with no graphical or quantitative evidence—that production
appears to fall after the 40-hour law took effect. Unfortunately, Sauvy’s views on the 40-hour law are not
entirely credible. As an advisor to the French government, Sauvy successfully pushed to have the 40-hour
week restriction relaxed in November 1938 (Sauvy, 1975). Thus, Sauvy had a life-long interest in arguing
that the 40-hour law had negative effects on the French economy.
20
Except in two cases (navigation and public transportation in the Paris region) in which the decree was
published after the law came into effect, there was generally a lag between when the decree was published in
the Journal Officiel and when the law came into effect. This lag is, however, not the same for every industry,
so it would be incorrect to use the date of publication coupled with a rule of thumb to determine the date
of entry into effect.

series is constructed using data on hours worked (Sauvy and Magnin, 1939, p. 470). Given
our interest in the effect of the 40-hour law in 1936-1938, this method of data construction
would be an obvious problem if it extended beyond 1935. But to our knowledge, it did not,
with the partial exception of the leather industry which we exclude in a robustness check in
appendix B.
Statistique Générale (1941) contains further description of the industrial production index
and some data unavailable in Sauvy and Magnin (1939).22 We check that the series documented in both Sauvy and Magnin (1939) and Statistique Générale (1941) match. With the
exception of a few typos, they are in all cases identical. Combining the data from Sauvy
and Magnin (1939) and Statistique Générale (1941), we have 22 industries with monthly
production data. This is fewer than the 43 series used to construct the aggregate index,
since in many cases confidentiality concerns prevented the underlying data from being published. For most industries the data begin in January 1928 and run through spring 1939. In
some cases, however, a lack of data prevented the calculation of series before 1931 or 1932.
Appendix table 6 provides further details on the individual series.
3.1.3 Prices Industry specific price data are somewhat sparser and of lower quality than
production data. Nonetheless, from various editions of the monthly supplement to the
Bulletin de la Statistique Générale de la France, it is possible to recover prices for 87 of
the 126 products in the French wholesale price index (figure 2b). Excluding agricultural
products and imports, 53 wholesale price series can be matched to an application decree.
For comparability with our output regressions, we focus on a subset of 12 price series that are
analogous to the output data underlying the industrial production index. For the products
for which we have both a price and a production series, we generally draw the price series
from the various editions of the monthly supplement to the Bulletin de la Statistique Générale
de la France. Absent production data at the product level, we use the price series for the
industry group as published in Statistique Générale (1941). Appendix table 7 details the 12
price series we use and their source.
Our concern about the quality of these data comes from the fact that in many cases
22

In particular, Statistique Générale (1941) extends several series through July 1939, and it provides data
on rayon production that were not reported in Sauvy and Magnin (1939).

17

reported prices move infrequently. For instance, the price of coal is unchanged between July
1935 and June 1936.
3.2 Identification Below we report correlations between the 40-hour restriction and production and between the 40-hour restriction and prices. We shall show that the implementation of the hours restriction is associated with a production decline and a price increase.
Our interpretation is that the 40-hour law restricted production and raised prices. But of
course it is possible that causality ran in the other direction: perhaps the path of industrial
production drove the timing of the law’s application rather than vice-versa. While we cannot
entirely rule out this possibility, the institutional details of the law’s application lead us to
believe it to be unlikely.
Article 7 of the 40-hour law required the consultation and participation of social partners
to translate the law into application decrees. As documented by Chatriot (2002), the process
began when the Department of Labor announced the start of consultations in the Journal
Officiel for a given industry. One might worry that the government chose to first apply
the 40-hour law to industries in which unemployment was particularly high. Table 1 helps
alleviate this concern. Column 2 shows that for the industries used in our analysis, little
timing variation was generated by this first phase of the process. For 20 of 22 industries, the
consultation was announced in either June or August 1936.23
In the months following the announcement notice, the Department of Labor organized
and hosted negotiations between representatives of employers and employees in each industry.
The length of these negotiations varied across industries, generating the observed timing
variation in the implementation of the law. For our identification strategy, one might worry
that the length of this negotiation process was correlated with industry performance. But the
description of these negotiations provided in Chatriot, Fridenson, and Pezet (2003) suggests
not.
First, Chatriot et al. (2003) find that negotiations were easier in industries such as mining
in which there was a long history of dialogue between representatives of employers and
employees than in industries such as metallurgy in which this type of negotiation was new.
23

For some industries, a second announcement date is listed when the announcement occurred in different
months in sub-sectors.

18

The last column of table 1 illustrates, however, that this was not enough to generate a
difference in the timing of the application of the law in mining and metallurgy. Of course, in
other industries the quality of dialogue between representatives of employers and employees
may have both directly affected output or prices and determined when the 40-hour law came
into effect. But industry fixed effects will be a sufficient control if this quality of dialogue
was constant over time.

Notes: Only industries used in our baseline regression (table 2, panel A) are shown. “Announcement” is the
publication date in the Journal Officiel of a notice to the social partners of the industry, which opened the
consultation process. “Decree publication” is the publication date in the Journal Officiel of the application
decree. “Entry into effect” is the date of entry into effect of the 40-hour restriction in the industry.

Second, Chatriot et al. (2003) provide examples of idiosyncratic technical difficulties in
implementing the law. These affected the duration of negotiations, since they often required
19

the Department of Labor to conduct surveys. Chatriot et al. (2003) mention industry-specific
issues such as a debate about mandatory break requirements in mining. A number of general
issues, such as the definition of “effective working time,” were also easier to settle in some
industries than in others. Fortunately for our purposes, these technical hurdles generate
close to ideal exogenous timing variation in the law’s implementation.
Finally, our causal interpretation is supported by contemporary observers, who directly
linked the decline in industrial production to the 40-hour law’s application. In the case
of mining, L’Activité Économique wrote, for instance, that “the application of the 40 hour
workweek in this industry [...] is the obvious cause of this decline in activity.” 24 In the case
of Metallurgy, La Revue Politique et Parlementaire notes that “producers are [...] facing
hurdles to increase production, which will only increase with the application of the 40-hour
week law, because of a lack of qualified workers.” 25 In January 1937, X-conjoncture concludes
that “the current problem [with the French economy] boils down to its supply elasticity as
demand has been regenerated.” 26

3.3 The 40-hour law and hours worked Our primary focus is on the effect of the 40hour law on production. But as an intermediate step, it is important to verify that the hours
worked data are consistent with a large effect of the 40-hour law. We obtain data on weekly
hours worked by industry from Statistique Générale (1941), pp. 157-158. Unfortunately,
these data are available for only six industries in our sample and are based only on reports
from establishments with more than 100 employees (Statistique Générale (1941), p. 23-24;
Huber (1946), vol. III, pp. 181-182). More problematic, and as mentioned above, the
40-hour law mechanically changed how firms reported hours worked.
Despite these problems, we believe it is informative to see the correlation between hours
worked and the application of the 40-hour law. Figure 6 shows the path of hours in these
24

L’Activité économique, N. 8, 01/31/1937, pp. 273-274. The French is: “L’application de la semaine de
40 heures dans cette industrie à partir du 1er novembre est la cause évidente de ce recul d’activité.”
25
La Revue Politique et Parlementaire, October 1936, p. 343. The French is: “Les producteurs font leur
possible pour satisfaire leur clientèle, mais pour pousser leur production ils éprouvent des difficultés qui vont
encore s’accentuer avec l’application de la loi de quarante heures, par suite de la pénurie de main d’oeuvre
qualifiée.”
26
Quoted by Schwob (1937), p. 150. The French is: “En face d’une demande réveillée, tout le problème se
ramène actuellement à l’élasticité de l’offre.”

industries along with vertical lines indicating the application of the 40-hour law in the
industry. In all cases, (reported) hours worked fell to just below 40 when or within a month
of the law’s application.27
3.4 Industrial production: graphical evidence To understand the effect of the 40-hour
law on production, we start with graphical evidence. Figure 7 shows the path of seasonally
adjusted industrial production in 6 industries.28 In each graph, the vertical line indicates the
month that the 40-hour law took effect. In most cases, production fell either on impact or
within a few months of the hours restriction. These graphs summarize our empirical evidence.
But from them it is difficult to discern either the statistical or economic significance of the
40-hour law.
3.5 Industrial production: regression evidence. A natural way to aggregate the data
from all 22 industries while controlling for idiosyncratic factors affecting production is to
estimate
∆log IPi,t = β1 ∆40-hri,t + β2 Xi,t + εi,t ,

(1)

where IPi,t is seasonally adjusted industrial production in industry i in month t, 40-hri,t is
a dummy variable equal to 1 when the 40-hour week restriction took effect in industry i,29
and Xi,t are control variables. 40-hri,t switches from 0 to 1 at different times in different
industries because of the timing variation discussed above. It switches back to 0 in November
1938 in all industries, since at that time the 40-hour restriction was relaxed. We deliberately
use the change in the 40-hour law as a regressor. The equation can then be understood as
the differenced version of a regression of the log-level of industrial production on the 40-hour
dummy. We choose to estimate the equation in differences because log industrial production
is likely non-stationary.
27

The abrupt application of the hours restrictions was not so much the product of ill-designed decrees
as argued by Sauvy (1984), but rather the product of difficult labor relations. Consultation with worker
organizations was required before making use of exemptions allowed by the application decrees, but these
organizations often considered these requests misguided (Margairaz, 1991, p. 400).
28
Due to space constraints, we do not show all 22 industries in our sample. Instead, we show the major
industry groups (except mining).
29
If the 40-hour restriction took effect after the 22nd day of the month, we code it as occurring the following
month.

Notes: In all specifications, the dependent variable is the log difference in seasonally adjusted industrial production in industry i in month t. “40-hour
restriction” is an industry-level dummy variable set to one when the 40-hour restriction is in effect. “Devaluation” is set to one after France leaves
the gold standard. All specifications with “Devaluation” include controls for 12 lags of the change in “Devaluation.” In panel A, the data are an
unbalanced panel of 22 industries beginning between January 1928 and January 1932 and ending between April and July 1939. Panel B contains
results from estimates at the level of aggregation at which the 40-hour restriction varies, approximately the industry group. This results in a sample
of 13 industries. Newey-West standard errors with 12 lags are in parenthesis. + p<0.10, ∗ p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01.

effect. Columns refer to the regression specification plotted from Panel A of table 2. Point-wise
95% confidence intervals are constructed using the parametric bootstrap with variance-covariance
matrix from the corresponding regression specification. Sources: See text.

Results are shown in table 2. All columns include industry fixed effects. Columns 1
through 4 also include month fixed effects. Columns 3, 4, 7, and 8 add 12 lags of industrial
production growth to control for past economic performance. This ensures that our estimates are not driven by selected application of the 40-hour restriction to stronger or weaker
industries. By using lags of the dependent variable, we are interpreting the effect of the
40-hour law as the difference between the actual path of output in the industry and the path
that would have been expected given lagged output. In odd columns, we only estimate the
25

12

contemporaneous effect of the 40-hour restriction. In even columns, we add 12 lags of the
change in the 40-hour law to determine the persistence of its effects.
Panel A shows results for the complete set of 22 industries. This sample provides the best
estimate of the size of the effect of the 40-hour law on production. Across all specifications,
the estimated contraction in industrial production is around 5% when the 40-hour law comes
into effect. This effect is statistically significant at the 1% level with Newey-West standard
errors. In figure 8 we also report the impulse response functions for the level of industrial
production implied by the regressions with 12 decree lags (column 2). The results for the
40-hour law’s immediate effect on output are similar across specifications, but there are
differences in the implied dynamic effects. When we control for time fixed effects (figures
8a and 8b), the impulse response function is flat, implying a level drop in output from the
40-hour law. Without time fixed effects (figures 8c and 8d), there appears to be a further
decline in industrial production after the 40-hour law takes effect.
In the specifications in table 2 without time fixed effects, we are able to explore the
effects of a dummy for devaluation equal to 1 in October 1936 and after.30 The dummy is
statistically significant, and its magnitude suggests a substantial positive effect of devaluation
on production. Thus, the regressions confirm the story in the previous section: devaluation
had an expansionary effect, but this effect was counteracted by hours restrictions.
In figure 9 we explore whether leads and lags of the variable ∆40-hri,t also enter significantly. If the 40-hour law negatively impacted production, one should see a negative
coefficient when it began to bind, and coefficients close to zero on the leads of ∆40-hri,t . By
contrast, if there were news effects of the law or if the law was selectively applied to weaker
industries, we would also expect to see significant coefficients on the leads of ∆40-hri,t . As in
table 2, there is a statistically and economically significant negative coefficient on the change
in the 40-hour law in the month when the law took effect. All other coefficients on leads and
lags of the change in the law are insignificantly different from zero. Thus, the graph suggests that when the law began to bind, it lowered industrial production growth by roughly 5
percentage points. There is no evidence of effects of the law on individual industries before
it took effect. Therefore, the observed negative effect of the law on production is unlikely to
30

In keeping with our convention for the 40-hour law dates, we code devaluation as occurring in October
1936, since it occurred on September 26, 1936.

be due to pre-trends in affected industries.
A concern for inference is that Newey-West standard errors account for autocorrelation of
the residuals, but not cross-sectional correlation of the residuals. For instance, it is likely that
the production of cast iron and of steel was correlated. This cross-sectional correlation is a
problem for inference since most of the variation in the 40-hour law occurred at the industry
group level (e.g. metallurgy), rather than at the industry level (e.g. steel production).
With a larger sample of industries and industry groups, the appropriate solution would be
to cluster. But our sample contains too few industry groups for this solution. Instead, we
rerun our regressions at the level of aggregation at which we observe variation in the 40-hour
law. This is similar to an approach suggested by Angrist and Pischke (2008) and Donald
and Lang (2007). For instance, we use data on metallurgy production, which averages the
production of cast iron, steel, and zinc.
These industry group results are shown in panel B of table 2. Standard errors are only
slightly larger. Thus, despite some decline in the size of the coefficient on the 40-hour law, it
generally remains at least borderline significant. This suggests that the statistical significance
of the coefficients in panel A is not driven by cross-sectional correlation of the errors. The
27

size of the coefficients differs in panel B from that in panel A, since the two panels implicitly
weight industries differently. In each specification, we treat each industry or industry group
as containing the same amount of information on the 40-hour law. Thus, the steel industry
in panel A receives a weight of 1 as does the metallurgy industry group (which includes
steel) in panel B. In any case, the implicit reweighting from panel A to panel B has only a
small effect on the qualitative interpretation of the results. Across both panels, we estimate
that the 40-hour law lowered production by between 3.5 percent and 6 percent on impact.
The specifications with lags of the change in the 40-hour law are also informative about the
cumulative effect of the law. These specifications imply cumulative effects generally larger
than the initial effect, on the order of 5 to 15 percent.
A further possible concern with these estimates is the presence of measurement error in
the industrial production data. The publications presenting these data, as well as Sauvy
(1984), emphasize that some of the industrial production series suffer from substantial measurement error. Importantly, since industrial production is our dependent variable, not our
independent variable, the presence of measurement error may be relatively unproblematic:
it is more likely to show up in the form of larger standard errors than it is to bias our coefficients. Nonetheless, in appendix B we describe the most severe measurement error problems,
and we perform a robustness check that excludes industries in which measurement error was
particularly severe. Results are quantitatively similar.

3.6 Prices The above evidence suggests that the 40-hour law reduced production. Presumably it did so by raising firm costs and thus causing firms to raise prices. To test for
this transmission mechanism, we use data on prices for industry-specific goods. We use the
specification discussed above (equation 1), but with the log difference of prices rather than
production on the left hand side. Table 3 shows results.
The first four columns, which include time fixed effects, suggest a price increase of 5
to 6% on impact. This is similar to the output response documented above. In columns
5 through 8, which exclude time fixed effects but include a control for devaluation, the
coefficient is smaller and no longer significant. The sensitivity of these results to the exact
control variables used as well as the sparse and poorly measured underlying data prevent
28

us from drawing strong conclusions. Nonetheless, this evidence supports the hypothesized
channel by which the 40-hour law raised relative prices and thus reduced demand.
3.7 General Equilibrium This empirical evidence above comes with an important caveat.
Despite negative effects on individual industries, the 40-hour week restriction could have been
expansionary for the economy as a whole by raising inflation expectations and thus lowering
real interest rates. By definition, this general equilibrium effect cannot be entirely ruled out
with sector-level evidence.
But the similarity of columns 1-4 and 5-8 in table 2 casts doubt on its importance.
Columns 1-4 include time fixed effects, and thus use only cross-sectional variation to identify
the 40-hour restrictions’ effect. By contrast, columns 5-8 also take advantage of time series
variation. If there were stimulative general equilibrium effects of the 40-hour week restriction,
one would expect the coefficients in columns 5-8 to be positive or at least very different from
those in columns 1-4.
Instead, we cannot rule out that the coefficients are the same. If anything, the smaller
standard errors in columns 5-8 suggest that rather than confounding the negative crosssectional effects with positive general equilibrium effects, the time-series evidence adds additional precision to our (negative) estimates. Nevertheless, we take the general equilibrium
argument seriously and analyze its plausibility in a new Keynesian model calibrated to match
our cross-sectional evidence.

4 The French experience and the new Keynesian model
Our approach is similar to that used in Nakamura and Steinsson (2014) to map crosssectional fiscal multiplier estimates to aggregate, economy-wide multipliers. Like their crosssectional estimates of fiscal multipliers, our cross-sectional estimates of the 40-hour law are
not directly informative about the aggregate effect. However, like Nakamura and Steinsson
we can use the cross-sectional estimates to discipline a new Keynesian model. We then assess
whether the general-equilibrium effects are consistent with the French data.

4.1 A simple new Keynesian model Before considering a multi-sector model that can
be directly matched to the data, we illustrate the implications of an hours restriction in a
simple new Keynesian model following Woodford (2003); the model is described in more
detail in appendix C. Because this model is now standard in macroeconomics, we directly
study the log-linearized equations:
yt = Et yt+1 − σ −1 Et (it − πt+1 ).

(2)

πt = βEt πt+1 + κ[(σ + η)yt − (1 + η)at − ψt ].

(3)

yt is log output; it is the nominal interest rate; πt is inflation; at is aggregate productivity;
ψt captures the effect of hours restrictions.
The first equation is the Euler equation of the model. Solving this equation forward
shows that expected future real interest rates are a key determinant of output today,31
−1

yt = −σ Et

X

(it+s − πt+1+s ).

(4)

s=0

Thus, any policy that lowers the expected real interest rate (it − Et πt+1 ) is expansionary.
A lower expected real interest rate reduces the incentive to save, raises spending, and so
stimulates output today.32 The strength of this effect is determined by the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution σ −1 .
The second equation is the new Keynesian Phillips curve. It says that inflation today is
determined by expected future real marginal costs,

where real marginal costs are the term in square brackets. Because of sticky prices, an
increase in current or future real marginal costs causes a gradual rise in prices, i.e., higher
31

In solving forward, we assume that output reverts to trend, limT →∞ yT = 0, which will occur if shocks
are temporary.
32
This result depends a on a firm meeting all demand for its product even if its preset price is unchanged.
This assumption is present in all new Keynesian DSGE models that we are aware of, and it reflects the
difficulty of dynamically solving models with both price and quantity constraints occasionally binding. As
such, it is possible that relaxing this assumption would bring the model closer to the data, but resolving
the computational issues involved is beyond the scope of this paper. (We are indebted to Miles Kimball for
emphasizing this point to us.)

inflation πt . Real marginal costs are increasing in output yt and decreasing in productivity at .
The strength of these relationships is governed by the elasticity of intertemporal substitution
(σ −1 ) and the elasticity of labor supply (η −1 ).
Hours restrictions are captured by a decline in ψt . Firms optimally employ each worker
for H̄ hours but may be restricted by law to employ them for only Ψt H̄ < H̄ hours at
unchanged salary, where Ψt = exp(ψt ). To capture the French hours restriction we first
assume that workers typically supply 48 hours out of a total of 120 waking hours each week,
H̄ =

48
.
120

In June 1936 (t = 0) the government announces that the 40-hour law will bind

starting in November 1936 (t = 5), so Ψt =

5
6

and total hours worked are Ht =

40
.
120

In

November 1938 (t = 29) the 40-hour law is abolished, and Ψt = 1. In short, the restrictions
imposed by the 40-hour law are:
Ψt = 1

t < 5;

5
6

5 ≤ t ≤ 28;

Ψt = 1

t ≥ 29.

Ψt =

(6)

Holding output fixed, an hours restriction raises the marginal cost of production because
more workers have to be employed at higher cost to make up for the short-fall in hours.
To close the model we need to specify how the nominal interest rate is set. Because the
nominal interest rate in France barely moved despite a large increase in inflation, we assume
it is fixed, it = ī, for the duration of the 40-hour law. To ensure the existence of a unique
bounded equilibrium, we assume that after some arbitrarily long time T > 29 the interest
rule follows the taylor principle, it = rt + φπ πt where φπ > 1.
We can then prove that the hours restriction raise output in the standard new Keynesian
model.

Proposition 1 Let ∆yt be the change in output due to the hours restriction (6) in the standard new Keynesian model with fixed nominal interest rates. Then output is unambiguously
32

higher while the hours restriction is in place,
∆yt > 0,

t < 29;

∆yt = 0,

t ≥ 29.

Proof See appendix D.1.
Intuitively, the hours restriction generates expectations of higher future prices by raising
production costs. With fixed nominal interest rates, the impact on output is determined by
the change in the future price level when the policy terminates,
∆yt = σ

−1

29
X

∆πt+1+s = σ −1 ∆p29 ,

s=0

where ∆p29 is the change in the price level at t = 29 due to the 40-hour law. Higher prices
in the future raise output today because they imply higher expected inflation and lower
expected real interest rates, which stimulates consumption demand and raises output.
While this model highlights the key mechanism through which an hours restriction raises
output in the new Keynesian model, it does not give us an estimate of the quantitative
magnitude of the output expansion, making it difficult to compare the model with the data.
We therefore turn to a non-linear, medium-scale new Keynesian model in the spirit of Smets
and Wouters (2007) that is better suited to providing such an answer.
4.2 Medium-scale model The medium-scale, multi-industry model is populated by households, goods-producing firms in each industry, and capital producing firms. We describe each
of them in turn. Appendix E lists the set of equilibrium conditions of the model.

With the wage set per-worker the firm will want to use each worker for the maximum

the firm will want to employ the worker for longer than the 40-hour week will allow. This is
because raising hours up to H̄it is costless once the real wage for a worker

4.2.3 Capital-producing firms: A continuum j ∈ [0, 1] of capital-producing firms produce, own, and rent capital. Capital for the next period, Kj,t+1 , is produced by using
1 + S(Ijt /Ij,t−1 ) units of output today, where Ijt is current investment. Existing units of
capital depreciate at rate δ. Additional units of capital can be purchased from other capitalproducing firms in a competitive market at price Ptk . Thus, a firms’ new holdings of capital
are
Kj,t+1 = (1 − δ)Kj,t + Ijt [1 − S(Ijt /Ij,t−1 )] + Xj,t ,

t > T,

where φπ > 1. In our simulation we let T = 600 months. In a robustness check, we allow
nominal interest rates to respond to inflation as they do in the data, but because that
response is in practice quite weak, we start with the simpler case of a constant nominal
rate.33

An additional advantage is that our simulation results are comparable with other work emphasizing
completely unresponsive monetary policy (e.g., Eggertsson et al., 2014).

Figure 10 – Hours per worker in each industry in the model experiment. At t = 0 (June 1936) the
implementation of the 40-hour law is announced. At t = 5 (November 1936), the first industry is
subject to the 40-hour law. Thereafter, the model experiment is conducted such that the timing of
the law’s diffusion across industries matches that in the data. As in the data, at t = 29 (November
1938) the 40-hour law is abolished in all industries.

4.2.6 Experiment We implement hours restrictions sequentially across twenty-two industries. The number of industries as well as the implementation dates mirror the actual 40-hour

These hours restrictions are plotted in figure 10. Note that time t = 0 corresponds to June
1936 when the 40-hour law is announced and t = 5 to November 1936, when the 40-hour
law is first implemented in an industry.
We solve the model under perfect foresight. Thus we can solve the full non-linear model
as in Christiano et al. (2015). This is important because linear approximation can yield
misleading results (Braun, Körber, and Waki, 2012).
4.2.7 Calibration: We calibrate the model to a monthly frequency. Because we lack detailed pre-World War II data to inform parameter values, we set our parameters to typical
values used in the post-war literature.
Standard parameters are α = 0.33 to match a capital income share of 33%, and a depreciation rate of 0.1/12 to match an annual depreciation rate of 10%. We set the investment
adjustment cost to ψ = 4 following Christiano et al. (2015). The discount factor is calibrated
1

to β = 0.97 12 to match the average 3% real consol yield from 1926 to 1935.34
We use middle-of-the-road values for the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, σ −1 = 1,
and the Frisch labor supply elasticity, η −1 = 1. For example, Smets and Wouters (2007) set
σ −1 = 0.7 and η −1 = 0.5; Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2011) set σ −1 = 1 and
η −1 = 1; Christiano et al. (2015) set σ −1 = 1 and η −1 = ∞; and Eggertsson et al. (2014)
set σ −1 = 2 and η −1 = 0.5. We set the elasticity of substitution across varieties to ζ = 10,
a standard value that matches the 10% price mark-up over marginal costs in post-war data
(Basu and Fernald, 1997).
As we show below, matching our cross-sectional estimates requires a price adjustment
cost of φ = 577. This corresponds to an average price duration of 4 months under Calvo
pricing frictions and firm-specific labor.35 The prices in our model are thus relatively flexible
compared to standard calibrations of the new Keynesian model, where the average price
duration is between 9 and 12 months following Nakamura and Steinsson (2008).

, where ξ = 0.266 is the Calvo probability that a

industry goods to θ = 10. This is the largest elasticity of substitution typically employed
in the literature (see Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Wieland, 2012). For lower elasticities
of substitution we require even more flexible prices to match our cross-sectional estimates.
In turn, more flexible prices further amplify the output expansion from the 40-hour law.
Thus our choice of a high elasticity of substitution biases us against the prediction of a large
output expansion from the 40-hour law.
4.2.8 Cross-sectional estimates: To verify that we make an appropriate comparison of
the model with the data, we check that that the model can match our cross-sectional estimates. We run the regression (1) with industry and time fixed effects on our model output.
Thus, as in the data, the variation that identifies the cross-sectional effect of the 40-hour
law comes from the differential timing. We target a cross-sectional output decline of -4.5%,
which is at the lower end of the coefficients in panels A and B of table 2.
Table 4 reports the coefficients with output growth, employment growth, and hoursper-capita growth as the dependent variable. By construction, the coefficient on the hours
restriction is -4.5 when output growth is the dependent variable. Thus, the model produces
cross-sectional estimates in line with our empirical estimates.

Notes: Estimates of the cross-sectional effect of the hours-restrictions in medium-scale multi-sector new
Keynesian model. Based on the regression specification (1) with time and industry fixed-effects. The price
adjustment cost parameter φ in the model is calibrated to yield a coefficient of -4.5 in the first column.

As in Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), our cross-sectional estimates are informative because they restrict the plausible parameter space of the model. In the model, the 40-hour law
must significantly move relative prices in order to on impact reduce relative output by 4.5%.
The necessary relative price movement requires that firms can easily adjust their prices. The
high degree of price flexibility in turn implies that the hours restriction generates a large
40

increase in prices under a fixed nominal interest rate policy.
4.2.9 General equilibrium results: Figure 11 shows the impact of the 40-hour law on
aggregate output, inflation, consumption and investment in the model. The 40-hour law significantly raises the rate of inflation, as firms increase their prices given higher marginal costs
of production. The large increase in expected inflation implies a large decline in expected
real interest rates given fixed nominal interest rates. As in the simple new-Keynesian model,
the decline in expected real interest rates raises output and consumption. The expansion is
very large: the model predicts that output more than doubles (a 150% increase) when the
40-hour law is announced.

Figure 11 – Impulse response function of output, prices, consumption and investment to the hours
restrictions in figure 10 in the medium-scale, multi-sector new Keynesian model. Month 0 is when
the 40-hour law is announced.

In the medium-scale model an increase in investment also contributes to the expansion
in output. Firms find it attractive to add capital for two reasons. First, the return to
capital is high: Higher consumption demand raises output, which raises the marginal product
of capital. Second, the real return on bonds, the alternative investment, is low. Both
41

factors contribute to investment more than doubling. Compared to the consumption impulse
response function, the investment impulse response function has a hump-shaped pattern
because the investment adjustment cost penalizes large swings in investment.
A t = 12 the 40-hour law becomes contractionary, although the magnitude of the contraction is much smaller than the magnitude of the earlier expansion. This is because the
agents in the model anticipate that the 40-hour law will end at t = 29 (November 1938).
Thus, at t = 12 they expect lower prices in the future, knowing that firms will more efficiently produce once the 40-hour law is abolished. Thus, the earlier intuition applies in
reverse: Expected inflation is (slightly) negative, expected real interest rates are high, and
so consumption contracts. Further, the return to capital is low so investment falls below its
steady-state value.
As this discussion makes clear, the contraction is driven by the correct anticipation of the
termination of the 40-hour law. While it is plausible that most people in France considered
the 40-hour law to be temporary given its controversial politics, it seems less likely that they
correctly anticipated when it ended. Thus, in appendix F.1, we capture the notion that
the law was expected to be eventually abolished at an unknown future date by letting the
expected hours restriction follow an AR(1) process after t = 29. Thus agents expect the
law to eventually be terminated, although in a less abrupt way than was actually the case.
Once the simulation reaches t = 29, the hours restriction is still abolished, but this is now
a surprise to the agents in the model. In that sense there is less foresight in this simulation
compared to our baseline. In this set-up the expansion from the 40-hour law is even larger
because the 40-hour law is expected to last longer. Further, the expansion is more prolonged
while the following contraction is shallower.
In appendix F.2 we conduct additional robustness checks. First, we allow nominal interest
rates to respond to the 40-hour law as they do in the data. Because this empirical response
is weak — at most a 3 percentage point increase for commercial paper (and less for other
interest rates) relative to the 40 percentage point increase in inflation — the results are very
similar to our baseline calibration. We also run simulations with price indexation, habit
formation and nominal wage rigidity. In each case, the model predicts at least a doubling
of output after reparameterizing pricing frictions to match our cross-sectional estimates. In
42

another exercise, we feed a smaller hours restriction into the model to match the actual 12%
decline in hours in the data. After reparameterizing, the model predicts a tripling of output
from the 40-hour law because the greater required price flexibility more than compensates
for the smaller shock. We also run a simulation in which the economy is first in a recession
before the hours restriction is implemented. Even when the initial recession is as deep as
a 15% decline in output, the new Keynesian model still predicts a large expansion due to
the 40-hour law. In short, in each exercise we find that the model predicts a large economic
expansion at odds with the French experience.

5 Can other factors explain the model-data disconnect?
In this section we consider possible explanations for the disconnect between the new
Keynesian model’s prediction and the French data. If a large negative shock hit the French
economy at the same time as the 40-hour law, then the expansionary effects of hours restrictions predicted by the new Keynesian model might not be visible in the data. Here
we consider possible candidates for such a shock. A full consideration of the many shocks
affecting the French economy in the mid-1930s is outside the scope of any single paper. But
we argue here that none of the obvious candidate shocks is likely to explain the underperformance of the French economy relative to the model.
One reason is simple: any negative shock that reconciles the model with the data must
have been enormous; the model predicts that the 40-hours law would more than double
French output. Thus for a negative shock to explain why the French economy does not
match the data, the shock must have reduced French output by more than 100%.
Perhaps the most obvious concern is that worries about war with Germany, or political instability in Europe more generally, discouraged consumption and investment. Cross-country
data suggests, however, that this was not a large negative shock. Figure 12 shows industrial
production growth and the change in wholesale price inflation following departure from the
gold standard for the countries for which Mitchell (1980, 1983, 2007) provides industrial
output and wholesale price data. The vertical axis shows the percent change in industrial
production between year t and t + 2, where year t is the year a country went off the gold
43

standard. The horizontal axis measures the difference between cumulative inflation from
year t to t + 2, and the cumulative inflation that would have occurred had the inflation rate
in year t − 1 persisted. This is meant to be a proxy for the change in expected inflation.
There is a strong positive relationship between the change in inflation and output growth.36
Importantly, with the exception of France, this relationship holds for countries that left the
Gold Standard in the mid-1930s, when one might have most expected a depressing influence
from political events. Belgium and the Netherlands grew strongly after their devaluations
in 1935 and 1936 despite their proximity to Germany.37 This is evidence against the view

40

that fears of war with Germany substantially reduced French output in 1936-38.

Another possible explanation for poor economic performance between 1936 and 1938 is
36

Including France, the relationship among the 21 countries is statistically significant at the 10% level;
excluding France, it is significant at the 5% level.
37
The cross-country evidence is also inconsistent with the view that France simply devalued too late
(Asselain, 1993). Perhaps the advantages of devaluation came primarily through terms of trade effects and
hence no longer existed to be exploited by France in 1936. Or perhaps the U.S. recession in 1937-38 made it
difficult for a European country to recover in these years. But figure 12 provides little evidence for this view.
The Netherlands also devalued in 1936, and its recovery fits neatly with the general association between
higher inflation and higher growth.

44

the breakdown of factory discipline that followed the May-June 1936 strikes (Prost, 2002).
Even after the initial wave of strikes subsided, workers resisted the reintroduction of factory
hierarchies and work regimentation (Jackson, 1988; Seidman, 1981). But while a possible
contributor to slow growth in 1936 and 1937, this story leaves unexplained why production
initially rose following devaluation, only to fall back a few months later. More generally, the
initial rise in output after devaluation is a puzzle for any model that seeks to explain French
economic performance with only supply-side factors.38
Furthermore, an explanation emphasizing strikes is equally problematic for the new Keynesian model. In the new Keynesian model, these strikes ought to have raised French output
by leading to higher consumption demand in anticipation of higher prices. Appendix D provides a proof in the simple model (section 4.1). Thus, strikes cannot resolve the disconnect
between the new Keynesian model and the data.
Other authors (e.g., Jackson, 1988) have blamed poor economic performance on a lack of
business confidence and capital flight. But the national accounts data provide little support
for this view. Between 1935 and 1937, overall French GDP was flat, but business investment
grew 43% (Villa data, series PIBVOL and IZE).39 It is also not obvious that capital flight
had negative effects on the French economy. Unless the central bank responds with higher
interest rates, there is no obvious mechanism through which capital flight lowers output
(Krugman, 2013). Indeed, by putting downward pressure on the exchange rate, capital
outflows are likely to lead to higher output. Summer 1936 in France is a case in point.
As outlined above, gold outflows put pressure on the government to devalue, which in turn
ignited a significant, though brief, recovery.
38
A real business cycle style model, for instance, might be able to match the decline in output that followed
the May-June 1936 strikes and the implementation of the 40-hour law in 1937. But it would be unable to
explain the large increase in French output that followed devaluation.
39
One can also look to the stock market for an indication of business sentiment. Deflated by consumer
prices (Sauvy (1984), v. 3, p. 356.), the historical CAC40 index constructed by Le Bris and Hautcoeur
(2010) fell 24% between the Popular Front’s election in May 1936 and devaluation in September 1936. It
then rose 42% increase in the 5 months following devaluation. This is consistent with positive effects of
devaluation on the French economy, and it suggests at least the possibility of optimism about the French
economy under the Popular Front. The interpretation of stock prices movements is, however, complicated
by several factors. First, these movements reflect in some combination the effects of the 40-hour law, other
factors affecting dividend expectations, and movements in discount rates. Second, a significant portion of
the French stock market was made up of companies whose primary activities occurred outside France. The
most important of these was the Suez canal company (Canal maritime de Suez). The Suez canal company
shares did particularly well in 1936 (Le Bris and Hautcoeur, 2010).

45

6 Conclusion
In 1936, the Popular Front embarked France on a radical experiment with supply-side
policies. It raised wages by fiat and restricted the work week to 40 hours. We show that
the stagnation of French output coincided with the timing of these policies, particularly
the 40-hour law. We also exploit quasi-exogenous variation in the timing of the 40-hour
law’s implementation across industries to estimate its effect on production and prices. We
find that it reduced production and raised prices in affected industries by roughly 5%. To
see whether these cross-sectional estimates can be consistent with the aggregate expansion
predicted by the standard new Keynesian model, we calibrate a medium-scale, multi-sector
new Keynesian model to match the cross-sectional output decline. The model implies that
by raising inflation expectations and reducing real interest rates, the 40-hour law ought
to have more than doubled French output. Since the aggregate data rule out an effect of
this magnitude, we conclude that the new Keynesian model is a poor guide to the effect of
supply-side policies in depressed economies.
These results are relevant both to current debates about structural reforms, particularly
in Europe, and to economists’ understanding of the effects of supply-side policies in the U.S.
during the 1930s. Many academics and policymakers have advocated structural reforms as
a solution to anemic growth in the Eurozone periphery (Fernández-Villaverde et al., 2014;
Lo and Rogoff, 2015). But as pointed out by Eggertsson et al. (2014), and as we verify in
this paper, standard new Keynesian models imply that structural reforms are likely to lower
output in depressed economies.
The debate over the effects of supply-side policies is unresolved in part because of a lack
of empirical evidence. Our paper contributes some such evidence from an earlier period in
Europe’s history. In France in 1936, as in Europe today, output was depressed and nominal
interest rates were mostly unresponsive to fluctuations in output and inflation. We show
that in these circumstances, a large supply-side shock—the 40-hour law—affected output
in the normal way. It lowered output. Conversely, the removal of the 40-hour law raised
output. Of course, caution is needed in applying results from the 1930s to policy today, but
at a minimum the effect of the 40-hour law suggests that further research is needed before
46

concluding that supply-side reforms will lower output in Europe today.
Our results also support criticism of the supply-side elements of the U.S. New Deal,
in particular the NIRA (e.g. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) Alchian (1969), Eichengreen
(1992), Bordo et al. (2000), and Cole and Ohanian (2004)). If, as argued by Eggertsson
(2012), the NIRA were a positive for the U.S. recovery, then the French recovery ought to
have been strong—in their effect on inflation, the Popular Front’s policies were an extreme
form of the NIRA. Our evidence that the 40-hour week law neutralized the positive effects of
devaluation supports Eichengreen (1992)’s (p. 344) view that “[I]n contrast to the situation
in France three years later, accompanying polices in the United States, while not uniformly
helpful [the NIRA], were at the same time insufficient to neutralize devaluation’s stimulative
effects.” Thus, the U.S. may have been fortunate that unlike Léon Blum, Franklin Roosevelt
was ultimately more committed to demand expansion than to supply restriction.
Overall, our results thus suggest a nuanced view of inflation expectations in depressed
economies: demand-side policies that raise inflation expectations may be expansionary (e.g.,
devaluation) while supply-side policies that raise inflation expectations may be contractionary (e.g., the 40-hour law). This is in contrast to the new Keynesian model’s prediction
that when nominal interest rates are fixed, any increase in inflation expectations will be
expansionary. We hope that future work will consider how the new Keynesian model might
be modified to better match the observed consequences of supply shocks.

A Narrative evidence on inflation expectations
To document whether or not contemporary business observers were surprised by the
increase in prices, we compiled an inventory of French private economic research institutes,
which published commentaries on the French economic outlook. This list is shown in table 5.
To construct it, we relied on four authors who provide information on the actors of this field
in the 1930s: an essay by Sauvy (1938) on the state of economic forecasting in France and
abroad; a statistical textbook by Huber (1946); a report on the state of the statistics field
in France by Marjolin (1937); and an article by Schwob (1937) published in the then leading
French academic journal, which surveyed expert opinions on the economic outlook in early
1937.
These publications generally provided coverage of the latest economic and financial data,
articles on specific topics, alongside a commentary on the international and domestic economic outlooks. Our narrative evidence comes from the three publications, which were described by all of the aforementioned authors.40 The monthly La Conjoncture Économique et
Financière was written by Jean Dessirier, a former statistician from the Statistique Générale
de la France. Along with a general commentary on the economic outlook, the publication
displayed, in a series of tables classified by topics, the latest economic data together with explanatory notes. These often included statements about the most likely future movements in
those variables. The quarterly L’Activité Économique, jointly published by the Institut Scientifique de Recherches Économiques et Sociales and the Institut Statistique de l’Université
de Paris, contained a short commentary on the French economic outlook. The Institut
Scientifique de Recherches Économiques et Sociales was an independent non-profit research
center created in 1933 thanks to a donation of the Rockefeller foundation and headed by the
economist Charles Rist. The monthly L’Observation Économique, published by the Société
d’Études et d’Informations Économiques, also contained a short commentary on the French
economic outlook. The Société d’Études et d’Informations Économiques was created in 1920
by different employers’ organizations to provide firms’ decision makers and public officials
with information and analyses on the economic and political environment.

40

The monthly X-crise, published by the Centre Polytechinicien d’Études Économiques, was also mentioned by these four authors. But the author of the commentary on the economic outlook is the same as in
La Conjoncture Économique et Financière for our period of interest.

May-June 1936
• “[Les mesures] se traduiront par une surcharge extrêmement lourde brusquement imposée [...] C’est dire que se poseront de complexes questions de rajustement de prix.” 41
[The policy measures] will result in heavy and suddenly imposed higher charges [...]
which will raise complex questions about price adjustments.
• “Il est donc inévitable que le consommateur soit appelé à supporter rapidement [...]
[l]’élévation du prix de vente.” 42 Consumers will inevitably face higher prices soon.
• “En augmentant rapidement les charges sociales, en transformant sans prudence les
conditions de travail, on poussera à la hausse des prix et du coût de la vie.” 43 By
increasing rapidly labor charges and transforming labor conditions without caution,
one will lead to higher prices and higher costs of living.
• “On doit s’attendre, bien entendu, [...] à une hausse sensible des prix de revient
français, qui pourra d’ailleurs se développer dans la période ultérieure.” 44 One should,
of course, expect [...] a substantial increase in cost prices, which will by the way
continue to develop in the upcoming period.
July-August 1936
• “[Le gouvernement] parait s’orienter vers une politique de hausse [des prix] dans tous
les domaines.” 45 [The government] seems to be moving towards a general policy of
higher prices.
• “[Les] facteurs qui sont a l’origine de cette hausse [des prix] [...], en simple logique
économique, doivent continuer à agir dans le même sens.” 46 Simple economic logic
suggests that the current drivers of price increases will continue to act in the same
direction.
• “[L]a hausse du coût de la vie, qui se développera à l’automne et à l’hiver, poussera à
nouveau dans le sens d’une hausse générale des prix, en plus de la hausse déjà réalisée,
dans les mois prochains.” 47 The increase in the cost of living, which will develop in
the fall and winter, will push again in the coming months in the direction of a general
increase in prices, in addition to the increase that has already occurred.
• “Nous croyons que cette aventure ne pourra être dénouée finalement [...] que par une
hausse importante de l’ordre de 30% au moins de nos prix interieurs.” 48 We believe
this experiment will eventually lead to a substantial increase in domestic prices on the
order of 30%.

• “Évaluation approximative (concernant l’ensemble des lois sociales récentes): [...] On
aboutit ainsi à une hausse de 18% de l’ensemble des prix industriels, dans un délais
limité, qui est certainement un minimum étant donné les hypothèses optimistes sur
lesquelles nous nous sommes placés.” 49 Approximative evaluation (of the impact of
the recent social laws): [...] We reach the conclusion of a 18% increase in industrial
prices within a short period of time. This is certainly a minimum given the optimistic
hypotheses that we used.
• “On peut s’attendre a une hausse importante de [l’indice des prix de gros] dans le
semestre suivant. Il est vraisemblable que la hausse générale des prix de gros atteindra
assez rapidement une amplitude de l’ordre de 15-20% dans l’ensemble.” 50 We can
expect an important increase in the wholesale price index in the upcoming semester. It
is credible that the general increase in wholesale prices will reach rapidly an amplitude
of 15 to 20%.
September-December 1936
• “La dévaluation du franc [...] se trouve placée sous une constellation de circonstances
qui agissent dans le sens d’une hausse des prix nationaux.” 51 The devaluation is taking
place amidst circumstances which all go in the direction of higher domestic prices.
• “La perspective [...] semble inéluctable, de voir continuer quelques temps l’ascension
des prix.” 52 It seems unavoidable that the increase in prices will continue.
• “On se trouve, en realité, devant la menace d’une hausse considérable des prix [...]
hausse des prix de gros de l’ordre de 50%, et une hausse du coût de la vie de l’ordre
de 30%.” 53 We are facing the threat of considerably higher prices [...] on the order of
50% for wholesale prices and 30% for the cost of living.
• “La hausse de grandes categories de prix [...] s’est poursuivie, comme on devait s’y
attendre.” 54 Price increases have continued as one should have expected.
• “Dans les mois suivants, la situation paraît devoir s’aggraver notablement, au point de
vue de la hausse des prix de détail, d’autant plus que l’application brutale et massive
de la loi de 40 heures est poursuivie.” 55 In the coming months, the situation seems
likely to worsen significantly for retail prices, as the sudden and massive enforcement
of the 40-hour law continues.
• “Cette [accentuation de la hausse rapide des prix de gros] se poursuivra très probablement dans les mois suivants. [...] Cette hausse [des prix de détail] se poursuivra
vigoureusement dans les mois suivants. [...] La hausse considérable du coût de la vie

à Paris [...] se poursuivra dans les mois suivants.” 56 This development [rapidly rising wholesale prices] will most probably continue in the following months. [...] This
increase [of retail prices] will continue vigorously in the following months. [...] The
considerable increase in the cost of living in Paris [...] will continue in the following
months.

B Data: sources and treatment of measurement error
B.1 Data details Appendix table 6 presents additional information on the industrial production data we use. Appendix table 7 presents additional information on the industrial
price data we use.
B.2 Measurement error We use Sauvy (1937), Sauvy and Magnin (1939), Statistique
Générale (1941), and Sauvy (1984) to investigate the extent of measurement error problems
in the industrial production data. Many of the series are not ideally measured. For instance,
moving average adjustments were often applied. Here we focus on identifying series in which
contemporary observers deemed the problems to be particularly severe. These industries were
the metal working industry group (apart from auto production), leather, and construction.
The metal working industry suffered from unusually sparse data on production (Sauvy and
Magnin (1939), p. 484). In the leather industry, the Statistique Générale applied an upward
correction to this index when the 40-hour law became binding, because the index fell “too
much” (Sauvy and Magnin (1939), p. 482). (Leather is the only industry in which we found
evidence of such an adjustment. It may have been necessary because leather also appears
to have been the only industry in which hours were used to impute production after 1935.)
Finally, for the construction industry, data were sparse, with the index in part based simply
on the number of floors contained in each new building (or added to existing buildings).57
Given these problems, we redid the estimates in panel A of table 2 excluding the steel
working industry, the copper working industry, the leather industry, and the construction
industry. Results are shown in table 8 .

57

Excluding construction has the added advantage of avoiding any influence on our results from the 1937
World’s Fair in Paris which may have had a large influence on construction activity (Seidman, 1981).

C The standard new Keynesian model
This appendix describes the model used in section 4.1. The derivation follows that of the
standard model in Woodford (2003).

where β is the discount factor, Ct is consumption, Nt is the number of employed workers,
each of whom supplies up to H̄ hours worker per worker, σ −1 is the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution and η −1 is the elasticity of labor supply. The parameter Ξt captures the
disutility associated with supplying total hours Nt Ht .
The household’s per-period budget constraint is
Pt Ct + Bt = Bt−1 (1 + it ) + Wt Nt + Πt ,
where Pt is the price of consumption, Bt are nominal bond holdings, it is the nominal interest
rate, Wt is the nominal wage rate for each employed worker, and Πt are profits rebated by
firms.
The household’s first order conditions are:
Ct−σ = λt .
Wt
Ξt Ntη = λt .
Pt
λt = Et βλt+1 (1 + it+1 − πt+1 ),
where λt is the Lagrange multiplier on the (real) budget constraint, and πt is inflation. We
model a strike in reduced form as a rise in Ξt . This increase implies that firms have to pay
higher wages to employ the same number of total hours.
The aggregate consumption good consists of individual varieties Cit that aggregate into
the consumption good

C.2 Firms Firms are indexed by i ∈ [0, 1] and produce varieties using the technology
Yit = At Nit Hit ,
where At is aggregate technology and Nit are workers employed at Hit hours-per-worker in
the production of variety i.
We first determine the firm’s (static) cost-minimization problem for a given level of
output,
Wt
Nit
Hit ≤H̄,Nit Pt
s.t. At Nit Hit = Yit .

The first-order conditions are:
Wt
Nit Hit = µt Yit .
Pt
0 = µt Yit ,

or Hit = H̄.

With a wage set per-worker, the firm will want to use each worker for the maximum number
of hours that she is willing to work. While stylized, the key for our purposes is that the
firm will want to employ the worker for longer than the 40-hour week will allow. Further,
consistent with the implementation of the 40-hour week, which was effectively a 20% increase
in weekly pay, any restriction of hours below H̄ keeps a worker’s wage unchanged.
The resulting optimal choices of labor and hours-per-worker are,
Hit = H̄;



Nit =

In our analysis, we also allow for the possibility that hours are constrained to a sub-optimal
level H̄t = Ψt H̄ < H̄. In that case, the firm’s optimal choices are
Hit = Ψt H̄;
Yit

The

D Proofs
D.1 Hours restrictions are expansionary
Proof Let Tψ be the duration of the hours restrictions, so the hours restrictions end at
t + Tψ .
Let ∆yt be the change in output due to the hours restrictions. Since the standard new
Keynesian model is forward-looking, past hours restrictions do not affect current output.
Thus, when the hours restrictions end at t + Tψ , the hours restrictions no longer have any
effect on output, ∆yt+Tψ = 0.
Given that nominal interest rates are unchanged, the solution for ∆yt is given by the
recursion:
∆yt+Tψ = 0;
∆yt+s = ∆yt+s+1 + σ

−1

Tψ
X

[(η + σ)∆yt+k − ψt+k ],

s = 0, ..., Tψ − 1.

k=s+1

For instance, the change in output one period before the restrictions end is
∆yt+Tψ −1 = −σ −1 ψt+Tψ .
Since an hours restriction means ψt < 0, this corresponds to an increase in output. Since
the change in output in the recursion is increasing in ∆yt and −ψt > 0, it follows that an
hours restrictions is unambiguously expansionary.
D.2 Strikes are expansionary
We allow for time-variation in the willingness to supply labor Ξt . The first order condition
t
for labor supply is then W
= Ξt Lηt Ctσ . Thus, if ξt = log(Ξt ) rises, then firms would have
Pt
to pay workers higher real wages induce the same amount of labor supply. The simple new
Keynesian model can then be written as,
yt = Et yt+1 − σ −1 Et (it − πt+1 ).
πt = βEt πt+1 + κ[(σ + η)yt − (1 + η)at − ψt + ξt ].
We next prove that strikes, modeled as an increase in ξt , are expansionary under fixed
nominal interest rates.
Proof Let Tξ be the duration of the strike, so the strike ends at t + Tξ . We model the strike
as a decreased willingness to supply labor, ξt+s > 0 for s = 0, ..., Tξ . We assume, as was the
case in France in 1936-38, that nominal interest rates do not change during the strike.
Let ∆yt be the change in output due to the strike. Since the standard new Keynesian
model is forward-looking, a past strike does not affect current output. Thus, when the strike
ends at t + Tξ , the strike no longer has any effect on output, ∆yt+Tξ = 0.
Given that nominal interest rates are unchanged, the solution for ∆yt is then given by
65

the recursion:
∆yt+Tξ = 0;
∆yt+s = ∆yt+s+1 + σ

−1

Tξ
X

[(η + σ)∆yt+k + ξt+k ],

s = 0, ..., Tξ − 1.

k=s+1

For instance, the change in output one period before the restrictions end is
∆yt+Tξ −1 = σ −1 ξt+Tξ .
Since a decreased willingness to supply labor implies ξt > 0, this corresponds to an increase
in output. Since the change in output in the recursion is increasing in ∆yt and ξt > 0, it
follows that the strike is unambiguously expansionary. See Wieland (2015) for an analogous
proof in continuous time.
Intuitively, the strike generates expectations of higher future prices since the cost of
production have risen. Higher expected inflation lowers real interest rates, which stimulates
consumption demand and raises output.

F Alternative model exercises
F.1 Imperfect foresight of 40-hour law termination Whereas in our baseline experiment agents in the model correctly anticipate the end of the 40-hour law, in the following
experiment we capture the notion of imperfect foresight. Specifically, agents anticipate a
gradual relaxation of the 40-hour law,

Expected path for hours per worker by industry

Figure 13 – Expected hours per worker in each industry in the model experiment where the 40-hour
law is expected to be more persistent.

At t = 29 it is then revealed that the hours restrictions are immediately abolished, so
that the agents expectations were incorrect. This captures the notion that the timing of the
termination of the 40-hour law was a surprise. Note that the actual path of the 40-hour law
is then the same as in the baseline experiment (figure 10), only the expectations of agents
are different.
In figure 14 we plot the implied output, consumption, investment, and inflation paths.
Relative to the baseline experiment each variable exhibits a stronger response because the
68

shock is larger (more persistent). Note that at t = 29 there is a discrete deterioration in
economic condition when news arrives that the 40-hour law will be immediately abolished.
This is because terminating the 40-hour law early implies less expected inflation, higher
expected real interest rates and thus a weaker consumption and investment response.

Figure 14 – Impulse response function of output, prices, consumption and investment to the expected hours restrictions in figure 13 when the realized path follows the baseline experiment (figure
10). Month 0 is when the 40-hour law is announced.

F.2 Robustness of the baseline experiment In this section we conduct five robustness
exercises. First, we allow nominal interest rates in the model to respond to the 40-hour
law as in the data, second we add price indexation to the model, third we add habits in
consumption, fourth we add wage rigidity, and fifth we set the hours restrictions to match
the actual decline in hours. In each case, we reparameterize the price adjustment cost φ,
such that the model replicates the cross-sectional estimates in table 4.
F.2.1 Match empirical nominal interest rate response We allow the central bank
reaction function to respond to inflation, Rt = R̄Πφt π , where we set φπ = 0.075. This
matches the 3 percentage point commercial paper rate increase from January 1937 to May
1937 as inflation climbed to 40% (figure 4). Other nominal interest rates were less responsive,
so this is likely an upper bound. To match the cross-sectional impact of the 40-hour law,
under this calibration we parameterize the price adjustment cost to φ = 555. As shown in
figure 15, the predicted expansion in output is essentially unchanged relative to our baseline
with fixed nominal interest rates. This reflects the small change in nominal interest rates
relative to the large change in inflation.

F.2.2 Price indexation To capture automatic price indexation to last period inflation, we
2
assume that the quadratic price adjustment cost is now φ2 Πi,t − Πχi,t−1 , where χ captures
the degree of indexation. Thus updating prices to a fraction of last periods inflation Πi,t =
Πχi,t−1 incurs no cost. In that case, the new Keynesian Phillips curve of the model becomes,

We parameterize χ = 0.5 to capture an intermediate degree of indexation. Micro-evidence
suggests an absence of indexation (e.g. Klenow and Malin, 2010) and Cogley and Sbordone
(2008) find that the aggregate data do not reject zero indexation once one accounts for trend
inflation. However, standard DSGE models tend to estimate indexation in the range from
χ = 0.5 to χ = 0.8.
To best match the cross-sectional estimates we parameterize φ = 1076, which corresponds
to an average duration of 5 months in a Calvo model. As shown in figure 15, the model with
price indexation predicts a quadrupling of output.
F.2.3 Consumption habits We allow for external habits in consumption, so that the
marginal utility of consumption is now given by

λt =

where h is the habit parameter. We set h = 0.833 in line with Smets and Wouters (2007) and
reparameterize price adjustment costs to φ = 840. The resulting impulse response function
of output in figure 15 is more persistent and hump-shaped, but still predicts more than a
doubling of output at the peak.
F.2.4 Wage rigidity We implement nominal wage rigidity following Bordo et al. (2000).
There is a continuum of labor types j that are substitutable with degree ζw . The relative
demand for each type of labor in industry i is

We set φw = 30.5, which corresponds to wages resetting on average every 3 months in a
Calvo model, and we set φ = 542 to again match the cross-sectional estimates. As shown in
figure 15, allowing for wage rigidity further amplifies the output expansion from the 40-hour
law relative to the baseline model.
F.2.5 Matching actual decline in hours The actual decline in hours was 12% in the
data. We therefor set Ψit = 0.88 whenever the hours restrictions are binding. The timing
is unchanged from figure 10. To match the cross-sectional estimates we set φ = 292, which
corresponds to an average duration of prices of 3.7 months in the Calvo model. The impulse
response function in figure 15 for this exercise displays a tripling of output.
