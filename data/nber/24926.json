    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate the effects of horizontal mergers on marginal cost efficiencies \u2013 an ubiquitous merger justification \u2013 using data containing supply purchase orders from a large sample of US hospitals 2009-2015. The data provide a level of detail that has been difficult to observe previously, and a variety of product categories that allows us to examine economic mechanisms underlying \u201cbuyer power.\u201d We find that merger target hospitals save on average $176 thousand (or 1.5 percent) annually, driven by geographically local efficiencies in price negotiations for high-tech \u201cphysician preference items.\u201d We find only mixed evidence on savings by acquirers.\n\n",
