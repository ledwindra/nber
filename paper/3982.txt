PRICE MARGINS AND CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT:
CANADIAN MILL PRODUCTS AND PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRiES

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to estimate a model incorporating nonconipetitive
behaviour in product and factor markets. In addition, capital accumulation is subject to
adjustment costs so that f'mns axe not constrained to be in long-run equilibrium.

The model is applied to two major Canadian manufacturing industries: pulp and paper

and mill products. The results show for both industries in each of the three product markets
and the wood input market that there is competitive behaviour. In addition, the industries are
not in long-run equilibrium as marginal adjustment costs cause marginal profit to exceed the
rental rate on capitaL
With the industries exhibiting short-run competitive behaviour in product and factor
markets, new estimates are derived for scale economies and rates of technological change.
Unlike the results from other studies, both industries exhibit small scale economies and
positive rates of technological change.

1. Introductiont
Canadian industries tend to be more concentrated than similar
industries in other countries (see Green (19851). This can resuLt in prices
exceeding marginal costs in product markets. In addition, and

especially

for

industries that use specific inputs, concentration can aLso result in
marginal revenue products exceeding prices in factor markets. The first
purpose of this paper is to deveLop and estimate a model incorporating noncompetitive behaviour in product and factor markets. The model is applied to

the Canadian milL products and pulp and paper industries.

These two

industries are selected because together they constitute the largest Canadian

manufacturing industries (wood and paper and alLied products account for 4.5%

of shipments and 2.7% of emptoyment in 1987). Hence there is the possibility

of price-cost margins in their product markets. The two industries are also
the major users of Canadian forests, which represent a significant natural

resource in the economy.

Thus it is feasible that the marginal revenue

product can exceed the factor price for the wood input in the mill products
and pulp and paper industries.
The approach adopted in this paper to model non-competitive behaviour

In product and factor markets is based on duality theory (see Diewert
(1982]).

The significance of the dual approach is that both product and

factor decisions are simultaneously modelled.

Thus, non-competitive

behaviour in product markets affects factor demand decisions, while
conversely, non-competitive behaviour in factor markets affects product
supply decisions.

Geroski (19881 and Bresnahan [1989] provide excellent

surveys of the empirical approaches to analysing price-cost differentials in

product markets. Most applications of the dual approach to non-competitive
behaviour have focused on product markets. Appelbaun [1979] for U.S. crude

petroteun and natural gas industry, Appelbaum and KohLi (1979] for the
Canadian manufacturing sector, AppeLbaua (1982] for U.s. rubber, textiles,
electrical and tobacco industries, Roberts (1984] for U.S. coffee roasting

2
firms, Morrison [1989] 'for U.S., Canadian and Japanese manufacturing sectors,

and Bernstein and Mohnen (1991] for Canadian chemical, electrical and
nonelectricat machinery industries. In this paper non-competitive behaviour
is parameterized using duality theory for both product and factor markets.
In previous studies of non-competitive pricing, production is assumed

to occur in either short or Long-run equilibrium.1 Assumptions regarding the

characterization of equilibrium are important for the investigation of non-

competitive pricing.

It is possible to wrongly infer that market power

exists in a situation where product prices are above apparent Long-run
marginal costs. Adjustment costs associated with changes in short-run fixed
factors (in other words, quasi-fixed factors) cause short-run marginal Costs
to exceed long-run marginal costs. It is then possible for product prices to

equal short-run marginaL costs. Firms behave competitively in the short-run

as they adjust towards a Long-run equilibrium.

Thus it is important to

account for firm adjustment in order to assess the existence of noncompetitive behaviour.

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting thet capital
accumulation is subject to adjustment costs (see Morrison and Berndt (1981],

Epstein and Yatchew (1985], Mohnen, Nadiri and Prucha [1986), Bernstein and

Nadiri [1989]). Firms that incur adjustment costs are unable to costlessly

attain Long-run

equilibrium.

Firms adjust toward the Long-run through

successive short-run equilibria. Indeed, at the margin, adjustment costs
characterize the deviation between short and long-run equilibrii.sn. In this

paper non-competitive pricing behaviour is modelled when firms incur
adjustment costs. Won-competitive behaviour can occur in either short or
long-run equilibriun.

Adjustment costs are an intrinsic part of firm technology.
Consequently their existence can affect the degree of scale economies and the

rate of technological change undertaken by firms. Moreover, scale economies

3
and technoLogical change are not invariant to the levels of output supply and

input demand.

Thus because non-competitive pricing affects equiLibriun

quantities in product and factor markets, observed degrees of scaLe economies

and rates of technoLogical change are influenced by deviations from
competitive behaviour. In this paper the degree of scale economies and rate

of technological change ore measured within the context of non-competitive
pricing in product and factor markets and capital adjustment costs.

The paper is organized into sections.

Section 2 contaIns the

development of the theoretical model. Section 3 details the estimation model

and results regarding non-competitive pricing and adjustment costs. Section

4 Investigates the degree of scale economies and rate of technological
change. The last section of the paper is the conclusion.

The ModeL
In general a firm's production technoLogy can be represented as

(1)

T(y(t),K(t—1),v(t),I(t),A(t))

0

where T is a transformation function, y is an L-dimensional vector of

outputs, K is an n-dimensionaL vector of capital inputs, v is an ndimensional vector of variable inputs (such as labor and materials), I is the
vector of additions to the capital inputs, and A is an indicator of the level
of

technology.

T is twice continuousLy differentiable, increasing and

concave in y and I, and decreasing and convex in K and v.

Since the

production process is defined over I, the gross investment vector, then there

are adjustment costs associated with expanding capital Inputs. These costs

are internal to the production process and are manifested by the foregone

output when resources are diverted from output production to capital
expansion, (see Lucas [1967], Treadway (19711 and Epstein [1982)).

is maximized subject to the production technology (equation (1)) and
conditional on the level and additions to the capital stocks.3 In this model

firms are not assumed to be price-takers In product and variable factor
markets. Price-setting ability is introduced through product and variable
factor shadow (or marginal) prices.

factor supply functions and interdependencies among variable factor
demanders.

Specifically the elements of 8 pertain to the inverse price

elasticities of variable factor supply and the conjectural elasticities of
firm interdependence in factor markets.
Diewert (1982) rigorously established that when r and S are matrices
of exogeneous variables a monopoList (or monopsonist) in short-run (or longrun) equilibriwn can be viewed as undertaking production decisions according

to the maximization of variable profit evaluated at the prices given by
equatIon (5).

the exogeneous

In this case the elements of r and 8 relate respectively to

inverse price elasticities of product demand and variable

factor supply. The Diewert result was extended to an oligopolistic framework

by Roberts (19&4). In this context the elements of F relate to the inverse
price elasticities of product demand and the conjectural elasticities of firm

interdependence in product markets.5 Diewert and Roberts refer to prices

defined by equation set (5) as shadow prices and the variable profit
evaluated at these prices as shadow variable profit.

6

Maximizing shadow variable profit leads to the shadow variabLe profit

function, which is denoted as
(6)

irS a 115(P6,W51K,I,A).

By applying HoteUing's Leirma with respect to the shadow prices (see Diewert
11982]), short-run product supply and variable factor demand functions are

(7.1)

y = tn;1 (P5145K1A)

(7.2)

v = -V11

(P2,W51K,i,A).

These equations show that short-run production decisions depend on product

and variable

factor shadow prices, the Level and additions to the capital

stocks and the indicator of technology.
There a nuiiber of attractive features associated with the use of the

shadow variable profit function to empirically analyse non-competitive
behaviour in product and factor markets. First, non-competitive behaviour in

one market affects output supply and input demand functions relating to all

markets in which firms operate. Any one shadow price affects the complete
array of decisions on product supply and factor demand.

Second, product

demand and factor supply functions do not have to be specified. Through the
shadow prices, non-competitive behaviour is parameterized by the elements of

the r and 0 matrIces.

However, a difficulty with the use of the shadow

variable profit function is that both price and conjectural elasticities
cannot be identified.

it

For example, without further information on price

is not possible to identify the nature of firm

interdependencies in product and factor markets. Nevertheless, the purpose
of this paper is not to investigate the various types of firm interactions,
but rather to determine whether firm decisions on product supply arid factor

7
demand equate product prices to marginal costs and variabte factor prices to

marginal revenue products.6 If shadow prices differ from market prices in
product markets then product prices differ from

marginal costs

of production.

In addition, if shadow prices differ from market prices in variable factor
markets then variable factor prices differ from marginal revenue products.

The second stage of production decisions pertains to the
determination of the demand for the capital stocks.

The equilibriun

conditions relating to the capital stocks are determined by using the shadow

variable profit function (equation (6)) and the capital accunulation
equations (equation set (2)). In this stage the shadow flow of funds

Equation (9) poInts out that the expected marginal benefit of the capital
stocks equals the marginal capital Input cost. The marginal benefit consists

of two cofrçonents; the marginal profit and the reduction in marginal
adjustment cost due to the undepreciated capital stocks brought forward to

period s+1 from periods. The marginal capital input cost consists of two
coaçonents; •the rental rate and the marginal adjustment cost. Another way to

8
view equation (9) is that the expected marginal benefit of the capitaL stocks

is equated to the respected shadow rental rates. These shadow rental rates
deviate from the market rental rates by marginal adjustment costs. If shadow
rental rates equal market rental rates then expected marginal profitabilities

equal market rental rates.

In this situation firms are in long-run

equilibrium. The existence of marginal adjustment costs impLy that firms are
in the process of expanding (or reducing) their capital stocks. In addition,

from the first stage characterizing production decisions, firms also adjust

product supply and variable factor demands as capital stocks change.
Therefore marginal adjustment costs (or deviations between shadow and market

rental rates) signify that firms are in short-run equilibrium.

In capital input markets, as for the other markets under
consideration, shadow prices govern firm decisions. However, deviations of

shadow from market prices in product and variable factor markets are the

result of non-competitive behaviour, whiLe the price deviations in the
capitaL input markets result from the production technoLogy and reflect
short-run equilibrium. It is important to account for both non-competitive
behaviour and the type of equilibrium. The reason is that it is possible to

incorrectly infer that product market power exists in a situation where

prices are above long-run marginaL costs.

costs because of the costs associated with capitat adjustment.

The

equilibrium conditions (equations (6)j7) and (9)) admit the possibiLity of

testing hypotheses reLating to non-competitive behaviour and short-run
equilibrium. Indeed, by parameterizing the shadow variable profit function
and the relationships between market and shadow prices, hypothesis testing
can be undertaken.

Model and Results

The modeL that is estimated consists of the equilibriun conditions

(equations (6)(7) and (9)). The data relate to time

industries.

and paper (SIC 271)

These two industries are selected because some interpretations

of the stylized facts suggest that firms producing mill products pay for
their wood inputs below the marginal revenue product earned through the use
of the input (see Constantino (1986] and U.S. international Trade Coumission
(1985]). while pulp and paper firms price their products above marginal cost

(see KLein (1985] and I4artinello 11985]. The two industries taken together

are the Largest manufacturing industries in Canada at the three digit SIC
level in terms of shipments and employment. In addition, these industries
are the major users of wood Inputs obtained from Canadian forests, which is

an important natural resource in the Canadian economy.
•

The model is

estimated for each of the two industries in order to investigate noncompetitive behaviour, in output and input markets.

A dynamic model is specified with capital adjustment costs so that

firms are not assuned to be in long-run equitibriun. The dynamic model is
•

•

•

preferable to estimate in order to examine deviations from competitive

behaviour in product and factor markets and deviations from long-run
equltibriun. The reason is that if the data are not consistent with long-run

equilibriun then the equality between shadow and market prices would be
rejected even if firms are acting competitively in the short-run.

The estimation of the model Is carried out using Industry data. In

other words, deviations between shadow and market prices are measured for

each of the industries. If all the firms in an industry equate shadow to

market prices then at the industry leveL these same equalities will be
satisfied. Hence unless firms exhibit non-competitive behaviour and incur
capital adjustment costs, the estimated model will not indicate inequalities

10

between shadow and market prices.

Hypothesis tests regarding deviations

between shadow and market prices do not test whether the product demand and
factor

supply curves facing the industry are horizontal, but

whether firms

decisions equate product prices to marginal costs, variabLe factor prices to
marginal revenue products and expected marginaL profits to rental rates. The

framework is usefuL in determining deviations between shadow and market
prices in product and factor markets.
In order.to estimate the equilibrium conditions a functional

form for the shadow variable profit function must be specified.

It is

assumed that the function is transtog, (see Jorgenson (19861 and the
references cited therein) which is a flexible functional form.

liarginal adjustment cost is assumed to be zero when net investment
is zero so that fri long-run equilibrium there is no difference between the
shadow and market rentat rates for capital (see Berndt and Morrison [1981],

Mohnen, Nadiri and Prucha (1986]).

Thus the adjustment cost function is

written as

Due to the parameterization of the

deviations between shadow and market prices, the short-run equilibrium
conditions are nonlinear in the parameters.9

represents the short-run deviation between the shadow and market rental rates

In order to estimate equation set (10), (11) and (12), shadow
variabLe profit is replaced by TV(l+5p.s.)rtS

where s 1=1

S are

respectively the revenue and negative of the wood and labour cost variable

profit components.

This means that the equilibrium conditions become

nonlinear in the variable profit components. Error terms are appended to
equation set (10) and (11) which reflect optimizing errors and technology
errors. The error term in equation (12) is a conditional expectation error

which arises when the conditional expectation of the future values of the
variables is replaced by their predicted values. The errors are assumed to

have zero expected value, and positive definite contemporaneous variancecovariance matrix.

In terms of equation (12), the zero expected value

assution means that expectations are rational.

The estimator used for equations (10), (11) and (12) is the
generalized method of moments estimator developed by Hansen (1982] and Hansen

and Singleton (19821. This estimator is equivaLent to the three stage Least
squares estimator if the random errors are conditionally homoscedastic (see

Pindyck and Rottembery [1982]). The endogenous variables in the estimation
modeL are variable profit, the five variable profit components (representing

the three products, wood and Labour inputs, and the capital Input.

The

instrt.rental variables that are used are the Lagged capital stock, tagged
relative product, wood and labour prices and the time trend.1°

The model is estimated for the milL products industry and the pulp
and paper industry. The model is estimated for each industry first with 11<0,

I=l,...3, 14>0. The estimation allows for non-competitive behaviour in the
three product and wood input markets. wext the model is estimated for non-

competitive behaviour in the product markets alone and then for noncompetitive behaviour in the wood input market alone. Lastly the model is
estimated with competitive behaviour in the product and wood input markets.

13

In order to test for the constancy of the -y

parameters the sample is

split in 1972. This year corresponds to about the midpoint in the sample and

to

the major oil shock experienced in the Canadian economy. With respect to

the mitt products industry, estimating the system of equations altowing for
both non-competitive behaviour, that is -yptc, and two different sets of the

'y parameters, yields a vatue of the objective function of 64.465.

(The

objective function is the minimized weighted sun of squares of the errors for

the system of equations). Constraining the 'y parameters to be constant over

the sample yields an objective function value of 65.422.

Thus the test

statistic is 0.957 which has a chi-square distribution. The critical value

of the distribution with 4 degrees of freedom (where 4 is the nunber of
restrictions) is x2o.osg9.488. Thus the null hypothesis that there is no
difference in the

parameters over the sample period cannot be rejected.

indeed, a similar result is obtained when 14=0 white yitO 11,2,3. in this
case non-competltve behaviour in the product markets is investigated along
with shifts in the values of the 'y i1,2,3 parameters. In this situation the

values of the objective function are 64.549 (unconstrained

irl,2,3) and

65.681 constrained). Clearly, in this case of non-competitive pricing in
product markets the null hypothesis of no changes in the

parameters over

the sample cannot be rejected.
This conclusion for the mill products Industry is quite strong and,

in fact, carries over to the pulp and paper industry. The values of the
objective function when alt of the

parameters are estimated are 62.914

(unconstrained), and 66.925 (constrained), in the case with non-competitive
behaviour in product markets, so that

i1,2,3

are estimated, the objective

function values are 65.009 (unconstrained), and 67.385 (constrained).

The reason for the conclusion that there are no differences in the
i parameters over the sample period in the mill products and pulp and paper

14

industries is that these parameters are not statistically different from
zero. In other words, the mill

in all three product markets and the wood input markets. This

result can be seen from table 1. Table I shows the values of the objective

functions and the test statistics relating to the parameter restrictions
concerning shadow and market price deviations, when the

parameters are

constant over the sample. The test statistic is distributed as a chi-square.

Clearly the non-competitive model nests both the competitive model and the
partially non-competitive models.

The null hypothesis relates to •the competitive model arid the
alternative is defined by the non-competitive model. The values of the test

statistic from table 1 are less than the critical values for the mill
products and

pulp

and paper industries.

Therefore the hypothesis of

competitive behaviour In the three product and wood input markets cannot be
rejected. Moreover, although by the nesting of the models all partial noncompetitive behaviour is rejected, it is instructive to see in table 1 how

little the values of the objective function change as more competitive
behaviour is imposed in the two industries.

The estimation results for the competitive model are presented In
table 2 for both industries.

profit, capital input and variable profit components at each point in the
sample for both industries. The variable profit function is also convex in
the product and variabLe factor prices at each point in the sample for both
industries.11

The estimates of fl found in tabLe 2 for the mitt products and pulp
and paper industry show that the industries are not in long-run equilibrium.

The estimate of the adjustment cost parameter is positive and statistically
different from zero.

Indeed, with respect to the capital input there are

significant marginaL adjustment costs so that the shadow rental rate exceeds

the market rental rate on capitaL. Table 3 shows the deviation between the

shadow and market rental rates. The wedge is defined by the ratio of the

marginal adjustment cost to the market rental rate. If the ratio is zero
then the expected marginal profit of capital equals the market rentaL rate
and there Is no short-run deviation between shadow and market rental rates.

On average for every Si spent on capital services the marginal profit on
capitaL exceeds the rental rate by $0.10 and $0.17 respectively in the mill

products and pulp and paper industry. The shadow rental rate deviates from
the

market rentaL rate in the pulp and

magnitude

paper industry by about twice the

found in mill products. Indeed, by inspection from table 3

of

the

minimum and maximum deviations, the relative differences between the two
industries is consistent over the sample period.

Therefore, the estimation results point out that there are no
differences between product prices and marginal costs and between wood input

prices and marginal revenue products in the Canadian miLL products and puLp

and paper industries.

In addition, these industries are not in long-run

Thus the Industries behave competitively in the short-run.

industry.

Specifically, with respect to product markets, prices are equal to marginal
costs. However, these costs are inclusive of marginal adjustment costs, and

therefore exceed apparent marginal costs derived under the mistaken
assumption that the industries are in Long-run equiLibriua.

4. Returns to Scale and Rates of Technoloqicat Chanqe
Previous estimates of returns to scaLe in the milL products end pulp

and paper industries in both the ILS. and Canada find that there are scale
economies (see Constantino [19861 and Mart inelto (1985] for surveys of these

results). However, scale economies are inconsistent with competitive pricing

behaviour In product and factor markets and Long-run equilibrium.

The

results in this paper show that competitive pricing cannot be rejected but

simultaneously the industries are not in Long-run equilibrium. Hence the
issue remains open as to the extent, if any, of scale economies when both
industries are In short-run equilibrium as a result of capital adjustment
costs.

Caves, Christensen and Swanson [1951] deveLoped a measure of returns
to scale within a muttiproduct framework with the marginal benefit of capital

not equated to the rental rate and with exogenous outputs. This measure was
based on the variable cost function. Output endogeneity necessitates that a

measure of returns to scale be developed which is based on the variabLe
profit function.

To develop this measure consider the definition of returns to scale
based on the transformation function Cl),

where A is the Lagrangian multiplier. Substituting these
equalities into the right side of equation (13) yields

(14)

Py = cz?risi4 zT=plnu"IolnKk/41sp

where s =

WIv/ri=1,...,n,sr Pjyj/T"J11...,t which are the variable input

cost and revenue components of variable profit.12 The estimates of returns

to scale are presented in table 4. there are small scale economies in the
mill products and pulp and paper industries. On average scaLe is around 1.15

in both industries and the estimates are very stable through the sample
period. Thus in short-run equilibrium there are small scale economies along
with competitive pricing in product and variable factor markets.
ALong with scale economies, the rate of technological change affects

the profitability of an industry.

Previous estimates of the rate of

technological change for mill products and pulp and paper industries in
Canada and the U.S. have been found under long-run equilibrium conditions.
The rejection of Long-run equilibrium implies that previous estimates of the

rate of technological change may be biased. Indeed, this may be the case as

previous estimates found negative rates of technological change in the two
industries over long periods of time.

In general there are two measures of the rate of technological
change; an output based measure and an input based measure (see Caves1
Christensen

and Swanson (19811).

In the context of multiple output

endogeneity and short-run equilibrium, based on the variable profit function1

the two measures can be derived from the transformation function (1). The
output based measure relates the cotmuon output growth rate to technological

change, given

the levels of all inputs. It is defined as

22

(15)

=

Ti4Ty

where t = InA is the indicator of the Level of technology. Translating this
formula in terms of the variable profit function, and noting that olru'Vjt =

-

It/tv,
(16)

= (olntV,Ot)/Els

Table 4 shows that the output based measure of the rate of technological Is

positive for both industries throughout the sampLe period.

In the mill

products and pulp and paper industries, the common output growth rate
averages around 2.8 and 3.3

per cent per annum respectively as a result of

technological change. Indeed, in these two industries technotogicat change

exerts a greater effect on outpu.t growth relative to the effect of
technological change found in other major Canadian manufacturing industries
(see Bernstein and Mohnen 119911).

The input based measure of technological change is defined as the

common rate of Input contraction due to technolo9icaL change, given the
Levels of all outputs. Thus from the transformation function (9,13

(17)

Zv = Tt/(tiTv+ T=1TkKk)

and in terms of the variabLe profit function

(18)

z= (oln?,et)/(4..js+ E=pLniv8lnKk).

CLearly, from equations (14), (16) and (18),

the two measures of the rate of

technological change are equal when there is constant returns to scale, since

however, because there are scale economies then z.,cz>,. This

result is found in tabLe 4.

In the mitt products and puLp and paper

industries, on average the input based rate of technological change is 2.5

and 3.0 per cent per annum respectivety. As for the output based rates of
technologicat change, the input based rates are relativeLy constant over the

sample period. The results on the rate of technoLogical change differ from

other studies.

Generally negative rates of technological change are

estimated for the mitt products industry (see Martinelto t1985] for Canada,

Jorgenson-Franmeni [19361 for the U.S. and Jorgenson et at (19901 for the

U.S. and Japan). These estimates are found under

the assumption of zero

adjustment costs so that the mitt products industry is in tong-run
equiLibrium.

In addition, also within a long-run equilibrium context,

Martirtetto estimated that there is a negative rate of technological change

for Canadian pulp and paper. The rejection of the assumption of tong-run
equilibrium, and therefore the rejection of zero adjustment costs, leads to

the result that the rates of technological change are positive for both
Canadian industries in short-run equilibrium.

5.

ConcLusion
A dynamic model with multipLe products incorporating non-coapetitive

behaviour in both product and factor markets was estimated for the Canadian

mitt products and pulp and paper industries. Deviations between shadow and
market prices were parameterized and it was found that in both industries
competitive behaviour occurs in both sets of markets.

The dynamic nature of the model arises from the existence of
adjustment costs associated with the capital input. Adjustment costs cause
deviations from long-run equilibrium. Indeed, it was estimated that the mitt

products and putp and paper industries are in short-run equltibriuTi.
Adjustment costs at the margin create a wedge between the marginal prof it of

25

capital and the rental rate.

It was estimated that the marginal profit of

capital is almost 20 per cent greater than the rental rate in the pulp and

paper industry and the wedge is about 10 per cent in the mitt products
industry.

Competitive behaviour in short-run equilibritn was found to be
coincident with scale economies in both the pulp and paper and mill products
industries.

It was estimated that there are slightly increasing returns to

scale at around 1.15. Technological change also occurred within the context

of competitive behaviour and short-run equilibrium. In fact, unlike other

studies which did not account for competitive product markets or capital

adjustment costs, it was estimated that there are positive rates of
technological change for both industries. The rates were very stable and
averaged around 2.5 and 3.0 per cent per annun respectively for the mill
products and pulp and paper industries.
There are different types of extensions to the research outlined in
this paper. First, the model can be applied to different iridustriea and to

firms within an industry.

second, the parameterization of the deviation

between shadow and market prices in multiple product-multipLe factor contexts

could depend on the sumnary statistics of product demand and factor supply

(see Baker and Bresnahan (1985fl.

In this way, for multiple product

industries that do exhibit product and factor market power, it becomes
possible to see how market power changes over time.

Data Appendix

The data for the miLl products and pulp and paper industry are
obtained from Statistics Canada, the saspte period is 1963-1987.

With

respect to miLL products, three products are considered, softwood litter,
hardwood Luther, arid other Lumber (namely shakes, shingles arid wood chips).

Output data is obtained from Statistics Canada CataLogues 35-204 and 65-202.

Output quantities are shipments and output prices are defined as revenues
divided by quantities.
There are three variable factors, labour, wood and energy. The data
on the variable factors are obtained from Statistics Canada cataLogue 35-204.
Labour quantity is hours paid and the Labour Input price is defined as Labour

cost (wages, salaries and supplementary payments) divided by labour Input
quantity. The wood quantity Is the wood used by sawmilLs and pLanning mills
arid the wood price is the cost of wood used divided by wood input quantity.

The energy input quantity and price is based on a Tornqvlst Index of
eLectricity, fuel oIL, gasoLine and natural gas used by sawmiLls and pLanning

mills.

The quasi-fixed factor is a Tornqvist index of buiLdings and
construction capital, and machinery and equipment capital. Statistics Canada

provided the unpubLished capital stock data which consist of gross and net

end of year stocks in current and constant dollars. The capital purchase
prices are defined as the ratio of current to constant dollar gross stocks.

In order to generate the rental rate on capital, the corporate income tax,
the investment tax credit and the capital cost aLlowance rates are obtained
from the Canada Gazette and Statistics Canada cataLogue 13-211. In addition,
the discount rate is taken to be the annual average of monthly average yields

of Government of Canada bonds with 10 or more years of maturity.

The

discount rate is obtained from the Bank of Canada Review.
With respect to puLp and paper, there are three outputs, newsprint,

27

pulp end other paper products (namely book and writing paper, tissue,
wrapping paper, building paper and paperboard). Output data is obtained from

statistics Canada cataLogue 36-204. Output quantities are shipments and
output prices are defined as revenues divided by quantities.
There are three variabte factors, Labour, wood and energy. The data

on the variable factors are obtained from catalogue 36-204. The variable
factors are defined in the same manner as for the mill products industry.
The quasi-fixed factor Is defined in the same manner as for mitt products.

The data is obtained from 56-506, 57-208k and from unpublished Statistics
Canida sources. Lastly the rentaL rate on capital is defined in the same way

as in the mill products industry and the various tax and interest rates are
obtained from the same sources. The technology indicator is the time trend.

For an oligopolistic industry in short-run equilibrium producing a

single product in competitive factor markets, the first order
approximation to variable profit for the representative firm is,

-

wTv_ H(Y5)YtyC2

where Y is industry output, II is the inverse product demand function

and the superscript e represents short-run equilibrium. The last
term in the variable profit expression represents additional profit
relative to the competitive Level that the firm earns from oligopoly
as the short-run conjectural elasticity
power Defining yeye/ye =
and fi (ye)ye/pe= ' as the inverse price elasticity of product demand
in short-run equilibrium, the shadow product price is P5 = PCI +

E5)-

(Notice that the elasticities are evaluated at the

equilibrium magnitudes, see Ceroski (1982] and Roberts (1984].) The
maximization of variable profit is euivlent to the maximization of
shadow variable profit, which is P5y - W v,since the shadow product
price is marginal revenue.
5.

Roberts (1984) focuses on different types of oligopoly models and
therefore he specifies aLternative types of conjectural variations.
As a consequence, he assumes that all firms are price-takers in
factor markets and the price eLasticity of product demand is constant

and exogenously given. In our context this means that 0 0 and the

elements of

1' represent known multiples of the conjectural

elasticities.
6.

An alternative approach to investigate non-competitive behaviour in
product markets using duality theory is through the cost and the

inverse product demand functions (see Appelbaun (1979, 1982],
AppeLbaun and Kohli (19791, Bernstein and Mohnen (19913).
7.

An alternative interpretation of 'y, i1, . ,4 are deviations between
shadow and market relative prices (that is prices relative to the
energy price).

8.

Equations (10.1) and (10.2) can be combined into a single function
with just a renormalization of jto reflect the fact that the shadow
variable function is defined In terms of the natural logarithms of
the variables. Shadow variable profit is now gross of adjustment

If the deviations between shadow and market prices are not found to
be zero then the revenue and variable cost components in equation
(14) are in terms of shadow variable profit and the marginaL profit
of capital is also in terms of shadow variabLe profit.

13.

The two measures of the rate of technological change can be modified
when market prices differ from shadow prices. In equations (16) and

(18) the shadow variable profit function is used and the profit
components are in terms of shadow variabLe profit.
