We develop a general-equilibrium framework for a small open economy to clarify the analytical and normative issues.  We highlight two failures of the laissez-faire outcome: there is too little investment and entrepreneurship ex ante, and too much production diversification ex post.  Optimal policy consists of counteracting these distortions: to encourage investments in the modern sector ex ante, but to rationalize production ex post.  We provide some informal evidence on the building blocks of our model.\n\n",
