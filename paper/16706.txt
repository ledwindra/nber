Modeling Processor Market Power and the Incidence of Agricultural Policy: A Non-parametric
Approach
Rachael E. Goodhue and Carlo Russo
NBER Working Paper No. 16706
January 2011
JEL No. C14,Q18
ABSTRACT
This paper examines interactions between market power and agricultural policy in the U.S. wheat
flour milling industry using a non-parametric approach. The analysis focuses on marketing loan and
pre-1986 deficiency payment programs; farmers’ payments from these programs are dependent on
whether or not the market price exceeds a “policy” price. It assesses if the payments trigger a change
in the underlying economic behavior of the milling industry, and any resulting change in the flour-wheat
price margin. The analysis compares the outcomes of using constrained and unconstrained sliced inverse
regressions in order to identify the significant factors affecting millers' pricing behavior. In both cases,
the link functions are then estimated using a non-parametric regression of prices on these factors.
Constraining the factors in the sliced inverse regression in order to generate coefficients that are easily
interpreted using economic theory does not affect the results. Based on the SIR factors, millers were
able to extract an additional $0.24/cwt. of flour by increasing their marketing margins in years farmers
received program payments. Based on the CIR factors, the increase in the marketing margin was $0.23/cwt.
In both cases the increase was approximately 10 percent of the estimated marketing margin in years
farmers received program payments.

Johnson (1979) identified six justifications for government policy, including agricultural policy.
One of these was the provision of a stable minimum level of income commensurate with that of
other groups in society. Equally classic analyses of the incidence of agricultural subsidies have
focused on comparing the deadweight loss across policies, given the amount of income
transferred to farmers (Wallace 1962; Gardner 1983). For the most part, these policy analyses
have assumed that agricultural markets are competitive enough that any market power on the part
of processors can be safely assumed away and the market treated as perfectly competitive (Rude
and Meilke 2004). Given this assumption, the assessment of the economic cost of a particular
support policy depends only on its deadweight loss and the size of the transfer to farmers. Russo,
Goodhue, and Sexton (2009), however, demonstrate theoretically that even small degrees of
market power can enable processors to extract a considerable share of policy rents.

The

recognition of this distribution of rents may make support policies less attractive politically.
The reliance on the perfectly competitive framework for analyzing policy incidence is
interesting from a historical perspective. Reducing the exercise of market power in order to
increase economic efficiency was among Johnson’s other justifications for agricultural support
policies. The economic history of agriculture suggests that it would be appropriate to address
processor market power when analyzing government support policies. Farmer protests against
the exercise of market power by other parties predate the major agricultural support programs
developed in the 1930s; for example, the Grange and Populist movements in the nineteenth
century were driven in part by farmers’ protests regarding their perceptions of the exercise of
market power against them in transportation and procurement (Stewart 2008). This earlier
movement resulted in the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922,
which exempted farmer cooperatives from antitrust regulations, was designed to enable farmers

2
to organize collectively in order to exercise countervailing market power against buyers.
This analysis examines the interactions between market power and agricultural policy in
the U.S. wheat flour milling industry. It has two main objectives: to assess if the payments
trigger a change in the underlying economic behavior of the milling industry, and to estimate if
the spread between the price of wheat and the price of wheat flour is affected by the policy
regime, holding everything else constant. Results indicate that wheat millers alter their pricing
behavior when the program is making payments and are able to extract a rent from government
intervention. These findings are consistent with a static model of oligopsony power. Theory
suggests that deficiency payments reduce the elasticity of farmers’ supply (e.g., Wallace 1962,
Alston and James 2001). Consequently, the expectation is that, holding everything else constant,
the oligopsony mark-down is larger when the policy results in payments to farmers than
otherwise. In this context, deficiency payments can be used as a natural experiment for
identifying millers’ oligopsony power, similar to other policy measures (Ashenfelter and
Sullivan 1987).
Previous literature has tested for market power in the U.S. wheat flour milling industry.
Brester and Goodwin (1993) found that the degree of cointegration of the price time series over
space and across the vertical wheat chain was negatively correlated with the CR4 index, and
argued that the increase in concentration was lessening competition. On the other hand, the price
series exhibited a high degree of cointegration, consistent with the possibility that the industry
remained competitive. Because the use of cointegration analysis may lead to ambiguous
conclusions, as it did in this instance, later studies have relied on structural models. Kim et al.
(2001) used a Poisson regression model to investigate changes in industry structure and found
evidence of oligopoly with price leadership. Stiegert (2002) tested for upstream and downstream

3
market power in the US hard wheat milling industry and found that the null hypothesis of perfect
competition could not be rejected. These analyses do not take into account the possibility of
interactions between government support policies and the exercise of market power in the wheat
market. Russo, Goodhue and Sexton (2009) did so using a standard New Empirical Industrial
Organization (NEIO) approach (Applebaum 1982, Bresnahan 1989). This approach relies on
shifts in supply, demand, or policy to identify the exercise of market power and identify its
magnitude.
The test for market power in these structural models is, implicitly, a joint test regarding
market power and the functional forms specified in the empirical model (Genesove and Mullin
1998). Consequently, the estimation is vulnerable to misspecification of cost, supply and demand
relationships (Perloff, Karp, and Golan 2007). Furthermore, the standard NEIO analysis leaves
many questions regarding industry behavior and its impacts unanswered. When economic agents
are strategic players, are market power parameters sufficient for describing their behavior?
Theory suggests that this is not necessarily the case. Although the so-called ‘agnostic’
interpretation of the NEIO market power coefficient is an effort to avoid this criticism,
misspecification of the economic game can still lead to biased estimation (Corts 1999). Strategies
may be more complex than simple Cournot strategies or may vary over time, such as collusionsustaining price wars in oligopolies or oligopsonies (Green and Porter 1984).
In the case of government intervention in agriculture, the unbiasedness of the NEIO
estimator is conditional on specifying the agents’ strategic reaction to the policy correctly.
Because this modeling choice requires prior information regarding agents’ economic behavior
that is not available in the case at hand, non-parametric techniques are used to characterize the
pricing behavior of the wheat milling industry without introducing assumptions about the nature

4
of the economic game governing processors’ conduct and without specifying functional forms. A
change is strategic behavior may be postulated if processors react to exogenous shocks in
different ways when a policy is in effect than when it is not. Moreover, if the price margin under
the policy regime is larger, then one may conclude that the millers are acting strategically to
extract a rent from the policy at taxpayers’ expense, ceteris paribus.

Background: the U.S. Wheat Milling Industry
U.S. farmers harvested 2.1 billion bushels of wheat from 51 million acres in 2007. The total
value of production including government payments was $13.7 billion (National Agricultural
Statistics Service 2008). Wheat production is concentrated geographically; the three major
production regions are the southern Great Plains (primarily Kansas and Oklahoma) the northern
Great Plains (Montana and the Dakotas), and the Northwest (primarily southeastern
Washington). The 2007 Census of Agriculture reported 160,818 farms classified as primarily
wheat-producing farms (USDA 2007). The total number of farms producing wheat is even
larger. Flour milling is the primary domestic use of wheat, although some is used for livestock
feed and other purposes. The milling process generates both flour and byproducts. Byproducts
account for approximately 10% of the revenue from flour milling (Brester and Goodwin 1993).
The milling industry displays a number of characteristics that are consistent with an
ability to exercise market power. The 4-firm concentration ratio in the flour milling industry is
reasonably high, and has increased over time. In 1974 the top four firms accounted for 34% of
total milling capacity (Wilson 1995). In 1980, their share had increased slightly to 37%, further
increasing to over 65% in 1991 (Brester and Goodwin 1993). Over that time period consolidation
was not limited to the firm level; between 1974 and 1990 the number of mills declined by a

5
quarter and the average plant capacity almost doubled (Wilson 1995). More recent data regarding
concentration, the number of mills, or plant capacity are not available for the wheat flour
industry alone; in 2007 the four-firm concentration ratio for the entire flour milling and malt
manufacturing sector was 56.6%, and wheat flour milling accounted for 60% of the sector
(IBISWorld 2007). Three of these large firms are large multi-commodity agrofood firms; Archer
Daniels Midland, ConAgra and Cargill compete with each other across a number of markets,
which potentially could strengthen their ability to collude. These firms increased their share of
the number of wheat flour milling plants operated from 14% in 1974 to almost two-thirds in
1992 (Wilson 1995).
Between the mid-1970s and 1997, per capita wheat consumption increased, even though
its share of total per capita grain consumption declined. There are a number of factors that may
have contributed to this increase, including increased consumption of meals away from home,
increased awareness of the health benefits of eating grain-based foods, and the promotion of
wheat products by industry organizations (Vocke, Allen, and Ali 2005; Brester 1999). Since
1997, per capita wheat consumption has declined, due in part to a new technology for extended
shelf life bread that has reduced the share of unsold bread, and due in part to an increased interest
in low-carbohydrate diets (Vocke, Allen, and Ali 2005). Another factor behind the continuing
decline in wheat’s share of total grain consumption has been increased consumer interest in
eating a variety of grain products, driven in part by an increasingly diverse population (Putnam
and Allshouse 1999).
Wheat is one of the major agricultural support program commodities, and government
payments are a non-negligible share of farm income for wheat producers. For farms
characterized as primarily wheat producers, government payments were approximately 20% of

6
average gross cash income in 2003. Government payments to other wheat-producing farms were
about 8% of average gross cash income (Vocke, Allen, and Ali 2005). These numbers are quite
dependent on the difference between the policy price set by the government and the market
price; in 2007, average government payments equaled 5% of the market value of agricultural
products sold for farms characterized as primarily wheat producers (USDA 2007).
U.S. farm policy is governed primarily by federal “farm bills” legislated every few years.
Wheat producers were eligible for three basic types of program payments during the period of
study (1974-2005), although implementation details differed. Direct payments are not linked to
market conditions while counter-cyclical payments depend on a season’s average market price.
Beginning with the 1985 farm bill, direct and counter-cyclical payments were restricted to a
share of production defined by base acres and base yields. Federal commodity loan and
marketing loan programs are the source of the third type of payment. Historically, these
programs were intended to promote orderly marketing by providing farmers with income at
harvest time that enabled them to repay operating loans without forcing them to sell their crops.
Because farmers could wait to market their production, harvest-time prices would not be
depressed by credit-driven sales. In addition to promoting orderly marketing, loan programs
have become an important source of farm income support in years with low marketing prices.
Some variant of a commodity loan program has been available to farmers since the
1930s. Under a loan program, a farmer pledges a specified quantity of wheat as collateral for a
loan valued at that quantity of wheat multiplied by the loan price. Farmers can choose to repay
loans at the market price, rather than the loan price, when the market price is lower. Depending
on the year, repayment could occur via forfeiting the actual physical product (a nonrecourse
loan) and/or redeeming commodity certificates, as well as through an exchange of funds. The

7
resulting difference in price is referred to as a marketing loan gain. Alternatively, for some years
in the sample the farmer could choose to receive a loan deficiency payment in lieu of an actual
loan. The policy price on which loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gain payments are
calculated is the loan rate. The relevant market price for loan repayments is the “posted county
price” set daily by the government. It is intended to reflect market conditions in a county by
adjusting major market prices for transportation costs and temporary cost differences. Farmers
can lock in the loan rate as the price for their production by choosing to repay their loan at the
posted county price rather than the loan rate, resulting in a marketing loan gain, or by requesting
a loan deficiency payment in the amount of the difference between the two prices on a given day.
We focus on loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains for three reasons. First,
some variant of this program has been available to producers throughout the study period.
Second, there has been no change in the share of production eligible for at least one of these
payments. Finally, whether or not farmers receive payments is linked to the market price via the
posted county price.

Oligopsony Power and Marketing Loan Rates
This analysis addresses the possibility that a marketing loan policy may enable millers with
oligopsony power to increase their margins. Figures 1-3 illustrate the argument graphically by
comparing the effects of a marketing loan policy under perfect competition and monopsony.
Units are normalized so that one unit of wheat produces one unit of flour, and normalize millers’
production costs other than wheat to zero. Cases where the loan rate is the relevant price for
farmers are referred to as cases where the marketing loan policy binds.

8
Under perfect competition the market price P* is determined by the intersection of supply
and demand. If the loan rate is lower than the perfectly competitive expected price (LR<P*) then
farmers will repay the loan and the loan price will not affect the market outcome. If the loan rate
is higher than the perfectly competitive expected price (LR>P*), as depicted in Figure 1, then
farmers will increase production because the loan rate is the effective price they receive. In this
case, production Qs(LR) is independent of the market price. Millers will pay farmers the price
Pd(Qs(LR)) defined by the demand curve.
Figures 2 and 3 address the effects of the marketing loan program when the miller is a
monopsonist. If the loan rate is lower than the price the miller would pay farmers in the absence
of the policy (Po), then the market price determines output Qo (Figure 2). The margin received
by the miller, defined as the difference between the price of flour and the procurement price of
wheat at the quantity produced, equals Wo-Po. If the loan rate is higher than Po then the policy is
binding. Production is determined by the loan rate and is independent of the market price. The
equilibrium quantity Qs(LR) is found by evaluating the supply function at the loan rate.
Given that supply is perfectly inelastic with respect to the market price when the policy
binds, the price the miller pays farmers is indeterminate. Institutional factors suggest that millers
are in a relatively strong position to extract policy rents by reducing the market price of wheat.
Obviously, farmers have a weaker incentive to bargain for a higher price and greater share of the
surplus under a marketing loan program than in an unregulated market because they will receive
the loan rate regardless of the price they obtain from millers. Furthermore, as discussed earlier,
the wheat milling industry is relatively concentrated, while there are a very large number of
wheat-producing farms. Consequently, individual farmers have relatively little ability to

9
negotiate effectively.1 These factors are reflected in the organization of farmgate grain markets;
generally prices are set by buyers and farmers choose whether or not to accept the take-it-orleave-it offer.
There are two cases of binding policies defined by the relative magnitude of the loan rate
and the perfectly competitive price. The first case of a binding policy is shown in Figure 2. If the
loan rate is higher than Po and lower than P* then farmers produce more as a result of the policy.
The miller maximizes profits by paying farmers a farmgate price no more than the loan rate LR.
As can be seen in the figure, at LR the loan marketing program reduces the miller’s margin, all
else equal. At farmgate prices no higher than Pbind the miller’s margin would increase.
The second case of a binding policy is shown in Figure 3. If the loan rate is higher than P*
then the farmgate price will be no higher than the price that will equate the quantity demanded
with the quantity produced in response to the loan rate, or W(Qs(LR)). At that upper bound the
miller will have a zero margin. At prices no higher than Pbind the miller’s margin would increase.
The maximum price that the miller would be willing to pay farmers results in a lower
margin than when the policy does not bind in both cases. Consequently, whether or not the
marketing loan program allows millers to increase their margins is an empirical question. This
analysis considers whether or not millers are able to drive the price sufficiently low when the
policy is binding that they increase their margins.

Methodology
The structure of the empirical test regarding the millers’ margin is simple. Define Y as the

While some wheat farmers sell their output through marketing cooperatives, and the share of wheat marketed via
cooperatives was non-negligible during the sample period, the number of cooperatives is too large to suggest that
there may be off-setting oligopoly power. In 1973, a total of 1,965 cooperatives as a group accounted for 29 percent
of first handler sales. In 1993, 1,243 cooperatives accounted for 38 percent of first handler sales (Warman 1994).

10
millers’ margin calculated as the difference between the price of a hundredweight of wheat
products and the price of the equivalent quantity of wheat, d as a dummy variable defining the
policy regime (d=1 if the policy’s target price is above the procurement market price and d=0
otherwise), and X as a matrix of exogenous variables representing supply, demand and millers’
marginal cost shifters. The null hypothesis
H0: E(Y|X,d=0) = E(Y|X,d=1)
is tested versus the alternative hypothesis
H1: E(Y|X,d=0) < E(Y|X,d=1),
where E(Y|X,d) = f(X,d) and f is a function linking the exogenous variables and the policy regime
to the conditional mean of Y.
Running the test is problematic because there is no clear and reliable a priori information
about the linking function f(X,d) and which variables are in the matrix X. Consequently the test
may be biased because of possible model misspecification or arbitrary exclusion restrictions.
Much of the literature on competitive behavior addresses this information problem by
introducing assumptions regarding the linking function and using information available a priori
regarding the “most important” exogenous variables, such as marginal-cost components, demand
or supply shifters. It is widely acknowledged that these studies are joint tests on the assumptions
regarding the behavioral model, the link functions and the exclusion restrictions (Genesove and
Mullin 1998; Corts 1999). An alternative approach to the information problem is based on
pairwise comparisons of alternative models or nested models (Gasmi, Laffont, and Vuong 1992;
Karp and Perloff 1993). This strategy shares two major limitations with the first approach: it
relies on specific assumptions regarding demand and cost functions, and it selects the alternative
that fits the data best among those tested, which does not necessarily correspond to the true data-

11
generating process.
Given the challenges involved in implementing either of these approaches satisfactorily,
this section presents a non-parametric approach that is able to compare the conditional
expectations in the policy regimes even in the absence of information about the link function and
without imposing arbitrary exclusion restrictions in the matrix of the exogenous variables.
Assume that the available information can be divided into two matrices: a TS matrix of all
observable exogenous variables (X) that may or may not affect millers’ pricing behavior and a
T1 vector representing the millers’ margin (Y). The goal is to calculate the conditional mean of
Y without knowing which variables in X are relevant and without knowing the function linking Y
to X. The non-parametric approach used here addresses the two problems separately using a twostep procedure (Russo 2008).
The first step uses a sliced inverse regression (SIR) to identify the linear combination of
the exogenous variables (the SIR factors) that are the best predictors for the millers’ margin (Li
1991). The use of this dimension-reduction technique eliminates the need to use arbitrary
exclusion restrictions and specify functional forms in the estimation of the conditional
expectation. The second step uses the SIR factors as the independent variables in non-parametric
Nadaraya-Watson regressions (NW) in order to compare how the millers’ margin changes with
changes in the independent variables for years in which the policy resulted in payments to
farmers to those for years when it did not (Nadaraya 1964; Watson 1964; Li and Chen 2007).
The use of kernel estimators does not require imposing assumptions about the unknown linking
function.
The logic motivating this approach is intuitive. The obvious methodological approach to
estimating how the exogenous variables affect the margin without imposing specific function

12
forms is to use non-parametric regression techniques. Yet if S, the number of possible exogenous
regressors, is large, this approach is likely to suffer from the curse of dimensionality: adding
extra dimensions to the regression space leads to an exponential increase in volume, which slows
the rate of convergence of the estimator exponentially. In order to avoid this curse, the original
variables are compressed into a smaller number of factors that are linear combinations of the
variables using SIR.
Importantly, the use of SIR factors in the second-stage regression does not prevent
linking the pricing behavior of the milling industry to the original S exogenous variables. The
SIR factors are linear combinations of the original variables. The coefficients are estimated by
decomposing the consistent estimator of M, the variance-covariance matrix of E(X|Y).
Accordingly, the coefficients for the original variables can be computed and their significance
tested (Chen and Li 1998).
One drawback to the standard SIR approach is that the factors it identifies are not
necessarily interpreted easily using economic theory, which can make it challenging to utilize the
results to identify plausible behavioral models. In order to address this shortcoming, the SIR was
re-estimated with a set of constraints restricting the number and composition of dimensionreduced shifters to correspond to the predictions of economic theory. The results are not affected
substantially by the constraints.
The restricted model uses Naik and Tsai’s (2005) constrained inverse regression
approach (CIR), a special version of SIR, which enables the classification of the exogenous
variables in the matrix X as possible shifters of demand, farmer supply, and/or processor nonwheat marginal costs ex ante, using economic theory. Formally, given q linear constraints of the
form A '   0 (where A is the Sq constraint matrix), the constrained edr directions are given by

13
the principal eigenvector of (I-P) cov  E  z | y   , where P=Ã(Ã'Ã)-1Ã and A   xx1/2 A . The

output of the CIR is dimension-reduced shifters (DRS) that are linear combinations of exogenous
variables, summarizing – in the case at hand – the effects of demand, supply and marginal cost
shifters, respectively.
The link function F0 is estimated by regressing Y non-parametrically on the L linear
combinations of X instead of on the S original variables. Using the consistent estimates of the s
(instead of the true values) in a kernel regression does not affect the first-order asymptotic
properties of the estimator and the error term has the same order of magnitude (Chen and Smith
2010). The output from this step allows the examination of how shifts in the significant SIR and
CIR factors affect the millers’ margin in binding and non-binding policy years.

Data

The dataset contains information on wheat prices, flour prices, and other variables for 1974 to
2005. Data have been deflated using the producer price index (base year 1982) provided by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. The prices of wheat and wheat flour are those reported in the
USDA’s Wheat Yearbook for two locations: Kansas City and Minneapolis.2 These cities are
traditional areas of geographic concentration for wheat milling because they are major markets
near important wheat production regions (Wilson 1995). The price of wheat is reported in terms
of the cost to produce a hundredweight of flour, and flour and byproduct prices are reported
directly. The price margin is defined as the difference between the price of a hundredweight of
flour and byproducts and the price of the wheat used to produce it.

2

Firm-level price data are not available publicly.

14
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for these price series by market. Average real prices
in Minneapolis are higher, although the difference is not statistically significant at the 90%
confidence level. Real price margins are similar in the two markets: the average was equal to
$2.14/cwt. of flour in Minneapolis and $2.10/cwt. in Kansas City. Figure 4 illustrates the real
price trends in the two markets.
Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for the other variables in the dataset. The data
sources are the USDA, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, the Energy
Information Agency, the University of Michigan, and the World Bank. Increases in the cost of
fertilizer per acre (FERT), agricultural fuel per acre (FUEL) and hired agricultural labor per hour
(HLB) are predicted to shift farmer supply upward. The policy price (POL) is predicted to
increase supply when the policy is binding. Increases in hourly manufacturing wages (RHW), the
price of gas (GAS), the transportation price index (TPI), and the bank prime loan rate (IR) are
predicted to shift processors’ non-wheat marginal cost up. Demand is predicted to shift out as
population (USPOP), per capita income (USINC), wheat weight (WGHT) and protein content
(PRTN) (as proxies for quality), the share of the population that identifies as Caucasian (CAUC),
and per capita income in Japan (JINC), the largest importer of U.S. wheat during the sample
period, increase. Table 3 reports the pairwise correlation matrix of these variables. In addition, a
Kansas City dummy variable (KANS) is included in order to allow for any location-dependent
effects.3,4

3

The USDA time series for Kansas City prices is for No. 1 hard winter wheat and the Minneapolis price series is for
No. 1 dark northern spring wheat. Thus, the location dummy may include quality-related effects not captured by the
weight and protein variables, as well as other factors that differ between the two locations.
4
The analysis is limited to the market for wheat. Of course, in reality farmers’ wheat production is part of a larger
acreage allocation decision. Depending on the region, barley, canola, corn, hay, rye, and other crops are substitutes
in production for wheat. Including data regarding farmers’ potential substitutes for wheat would introduce
endogeneity concerns. Consequently, the analysis does not include data regarding the production, spot market
prices, policy prices, or futures prices of substitute crops. Similarly, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)

15
The dataset includes a dummy variable identifying the years when the policy is binding
(BIN); that is, years in which the policy price is higher than the market price. Although the
posted county prices are announced daily, data limitations require the use of less frequent
observations.5 Consequently the years in which the policy was binding are defined using USDA
yearly average data. A binding year (BIN =1) is defined as one in which the average market price
in that location is lower than the average “policy” price. The policy price is defined as the
average yearly loan rate from 1996 on, and as the maximum of the average yearly loan rate
reported by the USDA and the target prices of deficiency payments prior to 1996 (before this
date all production was eligible for deficiency payments so the program provided the same
incentives as the marketing loan program). Because both the policy and the market prices vary
over the sample period, one does not expect, necessarily, that binding policy years correspond
exactly to those years with lower market prices.
Figures 5 and 6 confirm that expectation. Figure 5 plots the policy price against the
market price for the Kansas City market, distinguishing between binding and non-binding years.
Figure 6 plots the same information for the Minneapolis market. The figures are quite similar.

competes with wheat and other crops for acreage, although multi-year contracts limit its endogeneity to some extent.
On the other hand, the criteria for acreage selection varied by enrollment round. Depending on the type of
environmental protection targeted, the importance of CRP as a competitor for wheat varied considerably during the
sample period. The analysis does not attempt to control for the farm crisis of the early 1980s because it was
generated in part by low commodity prices.
5
Choosing the frequency of data was a difficult modeling decision. Annual data in order to balances competing
concerns regarding the unit of observation. Because wheat is storable, more frequent observations are more likely to
be influenced by short-term storage decisions by farmers and millers. Farmers market their entire wheat crop within
a year, except under very unusual conditions, and millers seldom hold flour more than one or two months (Brorsen
et al. 1985). Inventories of wheat do extend across crop years; they are not addressed here due to the complications
created by the presence of government-owned and exporter-owned stocks. On the other hand, as discussed above,
the actual policy is implemented on a county-day basis. Incorporating this complexity into our analysis would be
difficult, if not impossible, due not least to the increasing importance of storage as the frequency of observations
increases. An additional practical difficulty is that some of the variables are provided on an annual basis, such as
wheat quality. Specifying a time period that is less than a year would make it more difficult to collect information on
exogenous variables, as would specifying a smaller unit of observation, such as a county or even a state. The
National Agricultural Statistics Service reports that over 1,800 counties in 42 states harvested wheat acreage in 2005
(National Agricultural Statistics Service 2010).

16
While for the very highest market prices the policy is never binding, there is no clear pattern
between the realized market price and whether or not the policy binds. The policy price appears
to be the primary determinant. This pattern is consistent with the policymaking process. Prior to
the 1985 Farm Bill agricultural price support program parameters were set for the next few years
in each farm bill, and were not adjusted for market conditions (Love and Rausser 1997). Since
1985, national marketing loan rates have continued to be set as part of farm bills and do not
respond to market conditions (USDA 2009).

data. Factor one increases in a statistically significant fashion with the price of gasoline It
decreases when the following variables increase: wheat protein content, farmers’ cost of hired
labor, the price of fertilizer, the transportation price index, the policy price, the percentage of the
population that identifies as Caucasian, and the Kansas City dummy. The second factor increases
significantly with wheat weight and the gasoline price, and decreases with the price of fertilizer,
the interest rate, the policy price, and the Kansas City dummy.
SIR factors and the policy regime. Figures 7 and 8 plot realizations over time of the two SIR
factors, distinguishing between years when the policy was binding and years when it was not. In
figure 7, the first factor decreased steadily until the mid-1990s, then remained stable until about
2000, when it began declining again. There is no clear link between the level of the factor and
whether or not the policy is binding. The second factor displays less of a trend over time, as
shown in figure 8. It tended to have higher realizations in years when the policy was not
binding. Figure 9 plots realizations of the second factor by realizations of the first factor, again

17
distinguishing between binding and non-binding policy years. As the figure demonstrates, there
is no clear link between the relationship of the two SIR factors and whether or not the policy is
binding even though the coefficient on the policy price is statistically significant for both factors.

Constrained Sliced Inverse Regression Results

Table 5 reports the CIR results. It includes the constrained edr directions and the t-statistics for
each coefficient on the exogenous variables in each DRS.6 Overall, the CIR performs well. The
signs of the coefficients match predictions. In the demand DRS, the U.S. population, Japanese
per capita income, the share of the U.S. population identifying as Caucasian, and wheat weight
have statistically significant coefficients with the predicted signs. The Kansas City dummy has a
statistically significant positive coefficient. In the farmer supply DRS all three input costs have
statistically significant coefficients with the predicted sign. In the miller marginal cost DRS,
wheat weight and wheat protein content have statistically significant coefficients. The costs of
non-wheat inputs have statistically significant, negative coefficients, as predicted. The Kansas
City dummy has a statistically significant negative coefficient.
DRS and the policy regime. The CIR results allow us to examine the relationships between the
three DRS and the policy regime. Figures 10 to 12 illustrate the distribution of the DRS over
time, differentiating between binding and non-binding policy years. The figures show that there
is a concentration of binding years before the 1996 policy reform, when the policy target price
was relatively high. The binding policy years are not associated with particularly low or high

6

The signs of the coefficients in the farmer supply DRS are reversed relative to the conventional format of
theoretical predictions in the table. That is, the positive signs on the cost of hired labor, fertilizer, and agricultural
fuel indicate that an increase in any of these costs will shift supply inward. This is simply an artifact of the sliced
inverse regression approach and does not affect the economic interpretation of the relationship between the
exogenous and the endogenous variables.

18
realizations of the demand or marginal cost DRS. Realizations of the supply DRS tended to be
lower in non-binding policy years.
Figures 10 to 12 each plot the realizations of a single DRS for binding and non-binding
policy years. Thus, they do not address the possibility that binding policy years are characterized
by interactions between the realizations of the DRSs that lead to low prices. Figures 13 and 14
examine this possibility. Figure 13 plots the policy regime against the demand and farm supply
DRS. To fix ideas, years in which the demand DRS has a large realization and the supply DRS
has a small realization appear in the bottom right-hand quadrant of the graph. In a partial
equilibrium graph of a market these points would correspond to market outcomes with relatively
high prices and low quantities. For a given realization of the demand DRS, as the supply DRS
realization increases in a partial equilibrium depiction of the market the price will fall and the
quantity produced and consumed will increase as the supply curve shifts out. If the target price
was constant, then binding years should be associated with high realizations of the supply DRS
for a given realization of the demand DRS. This pattern does not appear in Figure 13. Figure 14
plots annual values of the demand and marginal cost DRS. This figure does not demonstrate any
predictable pattern between the relationship between the two DRS and whether or not the policy
is binding. Consistent with Figures 10 to 12, Figures 13 and 14 indicate that high target prices
are a more important determinant of the policy regime than market conditions are.
Comparison of SIR and CIR results. There are differences in which variables have significant
coefficients between the SIR and the CIR estimations. Two variables that were significant in the
CIR demand DRS, U.S. population and Japanese per capita income, were not significant in either
SIR factor. Manufacturing wage was not significant in either SIR factor, although it was
significant in the CIR processing marginal cost DRS. The most important difference was that the

19
policy price has an insignificant effect on the farmer supply DRS in the CIR results, although it
had significant coefficients in both SIR factors.

NW Non-parametric Estimation Results

The second step of the procedure uses the SIR factors and the CIR DRS as regressors in a
Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator of the price margin with a cross-validation bandwidth. This
step defines the link function and allows us to compute the conditional mean of the millers’
margin.
SIR factors. Figures 15 and 16 plot how each factor affects the flour-wheat price margin for
binding and non-binding policy years. In figure 15 the price margin is always higher when the
policy is binding than when it is not, regardless of the realization of the first factor. The level of
the margin is virtually constant for the non-binding policy regime, regardless of the level of the
factor. The level of the margin first increases, then decreases for the binding policy regime as
the factor increases. There is no consistent change in the difference in the margins as a function
of the level of the factor.
In figure 16, the price margin is always higher when the policy is binding than when it is
not, except for very high realizations of the second factor. Because only observations for nonbinding policy years include very high values of the second factor, the behavior of the two
regressions at the very end of the domain is not emphasized. The margin first increases, then
decreases as the second factor increases for both the binding and non-binding policy regimes.
The difference between the two margins remains relatively constant until the right-hand end of
the domain.

20
The conditional mean of millers’ margin is $2.07 per hundredweight of wheat when the
policy is not binding and $2.31 when it is binding. The $0.24 per hundred-weight difference is
highly statistically significant, with a t-statistic of 3.398 obtained via bootstrapping.
CIR DRS. Figures 17 to 19 plot how the reduced-form demand, processor marginal cost, and
wheat supply DRS affect the flour-wheat price margin. Figure 17 addresses demand. The
estimated magnitude of the price margin depends on program status. For any given value of the
demand DRS, the flour-wheat price margin is larger when the program is binding than when it is
not. For both the binding and non-binding policy regimes the margin first increases with the
demand DRS, then decreases. In both cases the absolute values of the changes are small.
Figure 18 evaluates the effect of processors’ marginal cost on the price margin. The
observations for both regime types are clustered with respect to the realized values of the
processor marginal cost DRS, with the non-binding years at the extreme values of the DRS and
the binding years in the middle. This pattern suggests caution when interpreting the results.
There are differences between the binding policy and non-binding policy regimes. In the
middle of the range, the price margin is higher for a given realization of the marginal cost DRS
when the policy is binding but the opposite is true on the extremes. When the policy is binding
the price margin is virtually constant across values of the marginal cost DRS. When it is not
binding the price margin first declines as input prices decline and quantity increases, then
increases. Thus, for low realizations of the marginal cost DRS when the policy is not binding, the
result is consistent with Brorsen et al. (1985), who found that an increase in milling costs
increases the flour-wheat price margin on a one-for-one basis. However, for high realizations of
the marginal cost DRS when the policy is not binding and for all realizations when it is binding
the outcome is not consistent with Brorsen et al. (1985). Regarding the primary research

21
question, the results are consistent with the possibility that a change in policy regime triggers a
change in pricing behavior. For years when the policy is binding, millers appear to absorb as
least as large of a share of a marginal cost increase as they do in years when the policy is not
binding.
Figure 19 evaluates the effect of farmers’ DRS of wheat supply on the price margin. As
supply shifts out, the price margin first increases and then decreases in years when the policy is
binding. In years when payments are not made the price margin follows the same general pattern,
although it is much less responsive to changes in the supply DRS. These policy-dependent
relationships between supply and the price margin suggest that millers’ strategies differ
depending on whether or not the policy is binding.
The restricted model generates a conditional expectation of the millers’ margin of $2.02
per hundredweight of wheat when the policy is not binding and $2.25 when it is binding. The
$0.23 per hundred-weight difference is statistically significant, with a t-statistic of 2.5701
obtained via bootstrapping.
Implications. Overall, the analysis of the patterns obtained from the SIR-NW algorithm suggests
that the data are consistent with a simple static model of market power. The figures suggest that
millers are able to impose higher price margins in years in which the policy is binding. When
payments are made, farmers respond to the target price, and are less likely to store their grain and
wait for a higher price to be offered by buyers. This circumstance allows millers to exploit
market power and reduce the price of wheat relative to the price of flour.
The results of the two models differed in one important respect: the policy price was a
significant explanatory variable for both SIR factors but was insignificant in the estimate of the
supply DRS in the CIR model. Even though the two models varied in terms of which variables

22
were significant, there was very little difference in the results regarding the research question of
interest: whether or not the flour-wheat price margin is affected by the policy regime and, if so,
by how much. The results of the two models were consistent regarding the difference in millers’
marketing margins in binding and non-binding policy years. The N-W analyses based on both
models indicate that the margins were higher in binding policy years regardless of the
realizations of the shifters and DRS, respectively. That is, the higher margin found in binding
policy years is not due to characteristics of demand, supply, or processor marginal costs in those
years. In both models margins were about 10% higher in binding years, and the hypothesis that
the difference in the margins was not statistically significant was rejected.

Conclusion

As a sector, agriculture is subject to a great deal of government intervention. Although
expenditures have declined substantially in the past decade due in part to international trade
negotiations, in the last three years Commodity Credit Corporation total net outlays for
commodity programs have ranged between $9 and $13 billion, depending on economic
conditions. For wheat alone, net outlays ranged between $0.7 and $1.2 billion (USDA 2010).
Given the magnitude of these expenditures, there is an obvious public interest in efficient policy
measures.
This analysis demonstrates that market power might redistribute the benefits of
government intervention. It provides empirical evidence that U.S. wheat millers were able to
increase their marketing margins on average by approximately 10 percent when farmers received
payments through a marketing loan program. This expected increase in margins was computed
controlling for the realizations of a broad set of supply, demand and processor marginal costs

23
shifters in those years. In turn, these findings suggest that millers are extracting a rent from the
deficiency payment/marketing loan gain policy. Thus, the analysis suggests that the general
assumption that competitive models may be a good approximation for imperfectly competitive
agricultural markets does not necessarily hold, particularly if distribution, as well as efficiency, is
a concern.
