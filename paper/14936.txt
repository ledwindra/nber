Pollution and International Trade in Services
Arik Levinson
NBER Working Paper No. 14936
April 2009
JEL No. F18,Q56
ABSTRACT
Two central topics in recent rounds of international trade negotiations have been environmental concerns,
and services trade. While each is undoubtedly important, they are unrelated. In this paper I show
that the services-environment link is small, for two reasons. First, services account for only a small
fraction of overall pollution. For none of five major air pollutants does the service sector account
for even four percent of total emissions; for three of the five services account for less than one percent.
Second, those service industries that do pollute are the least likely to be traded internationally. Those
services for which the U.S. collects and publishes international trade data – presumably those services
that are traded internationally – are less polluting than services for which trade data do not exist –
presumably because the services are not traded. Even if we limit attention to the services that are traded
across borders, the service industries most intensively traded are the ones that pollute the least. The
bottom line is simple. International services trade bears little relation to the environment, because
services in general contribute relatively little to overall pollution, and those industries that are traded
internationally are among the least polluting.

Pollution and International Trade in Services
Recent rounds of international trade negotiations have increasingly addressed
services, a sector that has been growing as a share of output in industrialized countries,
and the negotiations have also increasingly focused on how trade affects the environment.
It is natural, therefore, to link these two subjects and ask whether increased trade in
services might affect the environment. In this paper I show that the services-environment
link is small, for two reasons. First, services account for only a small fraction of overall
pollution; and second, those service industries that do emit pollution (including through
the use of intermediate inputs that themselves pollute) tend to be the ones that are least
likely to be traded across international borders.
Trade in services only became a formal topic of international negotiation in 1986,
with the Uruguay round of world trade talks. The Uruguay round led to the General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which became law in January 1995.
Meanwhile, the combined value of imports and exports of services to the U.S. grew from
$296 billion in 1987 to $1.6 trillion in 2005 (see Table 1). Adjusted for inflation, this
amounts to a 243 percent increase in international services trade. During the same
period, real U.S. international goods trade grew by 153 percent. So while the service
sector only makes up 38 percent of U.S. international trade, its share has been growing.
It is thus easy to see why services have become increasing important to international
trade negotiations.
It is also clear that the environment has become increasingly important to trade
negotiations. Environmental groups have long protested trade agreements, partly out of
concern that producers will relocate to countries with weak pollution regulations,

avoiding strict regulations in developed countries and damaging the environments of
developing countries. The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation
(NAAEC) was a direct response to those concerns regarding the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAAEC requires participant countries enforce their own
environmental regulations. The link between trade negotiations and environmental
concerns was formalized in the U.S. in 1999 by Executive Order 13141, "Environmental
Review of Trade Agreements." The order stipulates that "the United States will factor
environmental considerations into the development of its trade negotiating objectives."
So both services and environmental concerns are attracting increasing attention
during international trade negotiations. Are they linked? The evidence suggests they are
not, for two reasons. Services contribute only a tiny fraction of overall pollution, even
taking into account the inputs necessary to produce those services. And those services
that are most heavily traded across borders are least likely to pollute. The first of these
two points is simplest, so I start with that.

Services account for a small fraction of pollution
To find out how important services are to overall pollution, I examine the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The
NEI houses the EPA's repository for pollution data compiled by states and industries. It
includes pollution from point, mobile, and area sources. The NEI reports emissions of
common air pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2) , nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide
(CO), particulate matter (PM10), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a precursor to
ozone, or "smog". I have obtained from the EPA the NEI for the year 2002,

2

disaggregated by four-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) codes.1 Using those
data, I separated out services from other large sources of pollution, and tabulated the data
in Table 2.
Table 2 reports the share of overall pollution emitted by each sector. For none of
the five air pollutants does the service sector account for even five percent of the total.
For the largest, VOCs, the service sector accounts for only 3.7 percent of total emissions.
In fact, the top row of Table 2 probably exaggerates the pollution from services
that could potentially be traded internationally. One particularly large polluting service,
transportation, does not necessarily belong. While transportation services are traded
internationally, that trade does not alter the location of the activity, or of the pollution
generated. An American can purchase airline travel from Montreal to Washington D.C.
from either a Canadian or an American carrier. Goods can be shipped across the United
States by American trucking companies or, under the NAFTA rules, Mexican or
Canadian companies. In no case, however, does the international trade change the
location of the economic activity. Importing the transportation does not change the route
the plane or truck travels, only who gets paid. In cases such as transportation, where
international trade merely involves a flow of payments, and does not affect the location
of the polluting activity, no trade-environment link exists.
There are, however, several counter-arguments to eliminating transport from the
analysis – and even some reasons why the transport component may be understated. If
increased international trade lowers the cost of transportation services, through
economies of scale, there may be even more transport as a consequence, and hence more

pollution from transportation. More importantly, transport is an input into many goods
and services. In the analyses that follow, I take into account the pollution caused by
intermediate imports, including transport, to the extent those inputs are used in current
production methods. If international trade increases, transport will increase as a fraction
of all goods and services, increasing their emissions total per dollar of output.
Accounting for these second-order effects is beyond the scope of this discussion, which
simply notes that services do not contribute much to overall pollution, and traded services
contribute even less.
If we do eliminate transportation from the list of services, the pollution from the
remainder of the service sector accounts for less than one percent of total pollution in the
U.S. (See the second row of Table 2.) For the largest, still VOCs, services now account
for only 0.7 percent of total U.S. emissions.
There is, however, one caveat to the calculations in Table 2. Some service
industries may not pollute very much directly, but may use inputs whose production
generates pollution. Or, they may use inputs whose production uses other inputs that
pollute, and so on. Some of the manufactured goods that emit 70 percent of the CO in the
United States may be used as inputs to service industries. If we import those services, the
location of that manufacturing activity may change as well, which means the
environmental consequences of services trade may be larger than suggested by Table 2.
To account fully for the complications arising from intermediate inputs, I use an
industry-by-industry accounting for pollution emitted in the U.S., developed by the EPA,
that includes both direct pollution and pollution generated indirectly by inputs. With
those data I can both account for the concern about intermediate inputs, and demonstrate

4

that the services share of total pollution is still small, and that those industries that pollute
are the least likely to be traded.

Polluting services are less traded internationally
To demonstrate a link between pollution intensity and trade intensity, we first
need definitions and data for both concepts.

Calculating trade intensity
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes annual statistics about
international trade in services (Koncz and Flatness, 2007). The BEA documents two
types of international services transactions, sales through foreign affiliates and crossborder trade. The first, sales through foreign affiliates, does not involve changing the
location of the service activities. U.S. imports of services via foreign affiliates occur
whenever a U.S. resident purchases a service in the U.S. from a company that is majorityowned by a foreign country. U.S. exports of services via foreign affiliates occur
whenever a resident of a foreign country purchases a service from a company that is
majority owned by the U.S. In neither case is the location of the service, or the pollution
generated by the service, shifted as a result of trade. All that changes is the ownership of
the company providing the service. According to the BEA, sales through affiliates
"are not considered U.S. international transactions, because under the
residency principle of balance-of-payments accounting, affiliates of
multinational companies are regarded as residents of the countries where
they are located rather than of the countries of their owners."

5

Accordingly, and because sales through affiliates do not change the location of pollution,
I ignore this first type of international services trade in the rest of this analysis.2
The second channel of international services trade, cross-border trade, will be the
focus here. This includes trades between unrelated parties and intra-firm exchanges
within multinational companies. These are recorded as exports and imports in the seller
and buyer countries' international accounts. To calculate the trade intensity of these types
of services, I add the values of exports and imports, and divide by total output.
Turning again to Table 1, we can see that much of the growth in services has
come from these majority-owned foreign affiliates. In fact, if we limit the analysis to
cross-border trade, total services trade in the U.S. has grown more at about the same pace
as total goods trade -- 162 percent compared with 153 percent in real terms. Or, put
differently, the ratio of cross-border trade to total goods trade was 0.24 in 1987 and 0.25
in 2005 -- essentially flat. Meanwhile the ratio of sales through affiliates trade to total
goods trade grew from 0.2 in 1987 to 0.36 in 2005 (see columns 4 and 8) . So the growth
of services trade has come mostly via channels that do not relocate pollution, and for
which there is therefore no direct trade-environment link.

Calculating pollution intensity
To calculate the pollution intensity of service industries, I rely on the U.S. EPA's
Trade and Environmental Assessment Model (TEAM), which reports a list of emissions
intensities for each six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)

2

One could argue that opportunities for sales through affiliates, via foreign direct investment, increase
economic activity and therefore pollution. That is a secondary scale effect that I ignore by necessity for
sales through affiliates as well as for cross-border trade.

code. These industry-by-industry emissions intensities were calculated by the U.S. EPA
and Abt Associates (2004) specifically to assess the environmental effects that might
arise from international trade agreements. TEAM is based on the 1997 NEI and can be
used to generate emissions factors (environmental consequences per dollar of output) for
1,099 six-digit NAICS industry codes, and for more than 1,000 different environmental
outcomes, including air pollutants, individual toxic chemicals, hazardous waste, and land
use. Here I focus on the NAICS codes that comprise the services sector, and common air
pollutants for which there are sufficient data on emissions by traded service industries.
Note that by construction these TEAM emissions coefficients only contain
information about pollution in the U.S. We cannot use the coefficients to say anything
about pollution changes overseas that result from changing imports or exports to the U.S.
If we see increased U.S. exports of a service, we can use the coefficients to tell us how
much pollution those exports are causing where they are produced, in the U.S. If we see
increased U.S. imports of a service, we can use the coefficients to estimate how much
pollution would have been emitted in the U.S. had those imports instead been produced
domestically. In general, I think of this concept as the U.S. pollution "displaced" by
trade. We can use the TEAM coefficients to estimate the amount of pollution that would
have been caused in the U.S. had imports been produced locally, or the amount of
pollution emitted in the U.S. as a consequence of producing goods for export.
Table 3a displays these direct TEAM emissions coefficients for each broad
category of services, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. They are calculated by
taking a weighted average of the emissions coefficients for each 6-digit NAICS code,

7

where the weights are industry's sales in 1997. Not surprisingly, transportation and waste
remediation are the two most polluting services.
There is, however, one complication mentioned above – the role of pollution
generated by intermediate inputs. If we simply rely on direct TEAM emissions factors,
we only measure the pollution emitted by each industry in production of its final output.
This would understate the pollution associated with a given change in services trade,
because pollution from intermediate inputs would be ignored.
A simple example may help to explain the problem. One internationally traded
service is industrial machinery repair and maintenance (NAICS code 8113). U.S.
airlines, for example, increasingly outsource their maintenance to other countries,
including Mexico, China, and the Philippines.3 The process of repairing an airplane does
emit pollution, including volatile organic compounds used in solvents. But the
manufacture of those solvents also involves pollution. Suppose that initially airplanes are
maintained in the United States, that maintaining planes requires solvent as an input, and
that solvent is entirely produced domestically. If the U.S. decides to outsource airplane
maintenance, pollution will decline in the U.S. for two reasons: a reduction in airplane
maintenance, and a reduction in solvent production.
How much of the decline in U.S. pollution can be attributed to the increase in
imported maintenance services? In this example, we can account for 100 percent, by
construction. The reduction in airplane maintenance will be reflected in the increased
imports of maintenance services. But the reduction in solvent production will not,
because there are no solvent imports. If we simply multiply the change in imported

Aviation Mechanics."

8

maintenance services by the respective direct emissions coefficient for maintenance
services, from TEAM, we will understate the pollution displaced by imports. The change
in solvent production occurs abroad and is embodied in the airplane maintenance. The
direct emissions coefficients understate the amount of U.S. pollution reduction that would
be the consequence of increased service imports.
To account for intermediate inputs properly, we need to account for not only the
pollution embodied in the intermediate inputs to imported services, but also the pollution
embodied in the intermediate inputs to those intermediate inputs, and so on ad infinitum.
(The solvent used in maintaining the plane itself requires chemical inputs that may
produce pollution, and so on.) For this calculation, the EPA and Abt used a basic
Leontief input-output framework to estimate the pollution caused by production of final
output, including intermediate inputs.4
Suppose that an n×n matrix C has elements cij representing the dollar value of
input industry i needed to produce one dollar's worth of output industry j. Then we can
write the total output, x, a vector of n outputs – one from each industry – as the sum of
output used as intermediate goods and final output, y.
⎡ x1 ⎤ ⎡ c11 L c1n ⎤ ⎡ x1 ⎤ ⎡ y1 ⎤
⎢ M ⎥ = ⎢ M O M ⎥⎢ M ⎥+⎢ M ⎥
⎢ ⎥ ⎢
⎥⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥
⎢⎣ xn ⎥⎦ ⎢⎣cn1 L cnn ⎥⎦ ⎢⎣ xn ⎥⎦ ⎢⎣ yn ⎥⎦

(1)

Or, in vector notation:

x = Cx + y

4

See, for example, Miller and Blair (1985).

(2)

If we were examining changes in U.S. production, we would observe x, the value
of all output, including both intermediate inputs and final products. Pollution could be
approximated by multiplying x by a vector of direct emissions coefficients, z, such as
those from TEAM. But when we examine trade flows, we see only the final product y,
without the production of intermediate inputs. In this case, we need a set of total
pollution coefficients. These coefficients must embody all the pollution generated by all
of the inputs to y, all the inputs to those inputs, and so on. To calculate this, solve
equation (2) for x to get
x = [I - C]-1 y = Ty

(3)

where I is the identity matrix.
The matrix T=[I–C]–1 is a standard Leontief total requirements matrix. Each
element tij contains the dollar amount of industry i necessary to produce one dollar of
output industry j, including the amount of i used in all other industries that are used in j,
as well as the amount of i used in the inputs to those industries, and so forth. The vector
x represents the total amount of manufactured goods necessary to produce output y. To
generate the total pollution coefficients, premultiply the Leontief total requirements
matrix by the z vector from TEAM as follows:

z% = z'T = z' [ I - C]

-1

The only new information needed to construct z% is C. That information can be
found in the input-output tables for the United States published periodically by the BEA.
The EPA used the 1997 input-output tables to create an estimate of C and to translate
direct emissions coefficients, z, into total emissions coefficients, z% , using equation (4).

10

(4)

Using the total emissions coefficients, z% , in place of the direct emissions
coefficients, z, captures all of the pollution generated by intermediate goods, and does not
understate pollution displaced by traded services. Unfortunately z% instead overstates
pollution displaced by traded services. If the solvents used to maintain airplanes in the
United States are entirely imported, importing maintenance from abroad displaces no
U.S. solvent production, and the appropriate emissions coefficient is the direct one (z).
The two emissions coefficients, direct (z) and total ( z% ), thus constitute lower and
upper bounds on the amount of U.S. pollution displaced whenever a service is imported.
The direct coefficient assumes there are no polluting intermediate goods, or that all
polluting intermediates were themselves imported. The total coefficient assumes all
intermediate inputs, as well as the inputs to those inputs, were entirely produced within
the U.S. In the analyses below I will present both calculations, but then use the total
coefficient, which overstates pollution from services, in order to be conservative in my
argument that internationally traded services account for little pollution.
Table 3b displays the total emissions coefficients ( z%i ), including pollution
generated by intermediate inputs. These are typically three times as large as the direct
coefficients in Table 3a.

Only some services have data on cross-border trade
The U.S. BEA collects data on international services trade for only a few
industries (Koncz & Flatness, 2007; Wichard and Borga, 2002). One natural
presumption is that there simply is no international trade in the other service industries.
The dollar values of international trade in haircuts, taxi rides, window-washing, etc. are

11

so small as to be not worth tracking or reporting. If this is true, then the main point of
this paper can be made quite simply. Those services that are traded internationally, and
for which the BEA reports trade data, are the least polluting service sectors of the
economy.
Table 4 makes this point. The top row reports the average pollution (per $million
of output) for the entire service sector. This is the same as the bottom row of Table 3a.
The second row of Table 4 reports that same weighted average for the industries for
which BEA publishes cross-border trade data. The average pollution emitted by these
traded industries is much smaller. The top panel uses the TEAM pollution coefficients
that understate total pollution because they only count the pollution emitted directly from
producing final output. These coefficients understate the pollution from both the "all
services" and "cross-border trade" categories, and including pollution from intermediate
inputs is unlikely to change the result that traded services are the least polluting.
To check this, in the bottom panel of Table 4 I report the same calculation using
the total emissions coefficients ( z% ), including pollution from intermediate goods. This
overstates pollution from the services sector (line (3)) because it double-counts services
used as inputs to other services, and it overstates pollution relocated by trade because
traded final product need not change the production location of intermediate inputs. The
basic point remains. Those services for which the U.S. BEA collects international trade
data – presumably those services that are traded internationally – are the least polluting.
This is clear whether we use the direct emissions coefficients for final product only, or
the total emissions coefficients counting intermediate inputs.

12

Among traded services, those traded more pollute less
Finally, among those services for which the U.S. BEA collects international trade
data, the industries most intensively traded are the ones that pollute the least. Table 5
supports this claim. It presents data for each of the 11 industries where the BEA collects
international trade information, and where the BEA category corresponds closely to the
NAICS classifications.
Column (1) of Table 5 reports the trade intensity for each of the industries. This
is simply total imports plus exports over domestic production. The two services with the
most international trade are reinsurance (NAICS 52413), driven by $12 billion worth of
imports in 2002, and education (NAICS 611), driven by $13 billion worth of exports.
Given the nature of these two industries, it is immediately obvious that more heavily
traded industries pollute less.
Columns (2) through (7) report the pollution intensities, including intermediate
inputs, for each of the industries and for each of the six pollutants. Below the industryspecific data, I report the raw correlations between trade intensity (column (1)), and the
relevant pollution intensities. All of the correlations are negative except for VOCs. The
positive VOC correlation is driven by the last industry, commercial and industrial
machinery repair and maintenance (NAIC 8113), which has both high pollution and high
international trade. If I drop industry 8113 from the correlation, they all become even
more negative, including the VOC correlation.
The negative relationship between trade intensity and pollution intensity is not
driven by the two outliers, education and reinsurance. At the bottom of Table 5, I report

13

the correlations excluding those two industries. Again, all of the correlations, except for
VOCs, are negative, even omitting those two heavily traded, non-polluting industries.

Are these results different for trade within NAFTA?
A final concern one might have involves the degree to which trade agreements or
geographic proximity affect the conclusion that traded services do not pollute. Services
trade with neighboring countries might be different than services trade with far distant
countries. Or, trade agreements such as the NAFTA may alter the pollution-intensity of
services trade.
At the very bottom of Table 5, I report the correlations between the pollution
intensity and the trade intensity of each industry with Canada and Mexico, respectively.
If anything, this makes the case stronger. The correlations between pollution intensity
and services trade with Canada is, for every pollutant, more negative that for trade with
all countries. The correlations for trade with Mexico are more negative for four of the six
pollutants. Limiting the analysis to the NAFTA countries does not alter the conclusion
that traded services are the least polluting.

An aside: Tourism
Several readers of early drafts expressed concern that the analysis omits tourism,
an increasingly important international service transaction with potential environmental
consequences. The concern is half correct. In the first part of this analysis, where I show
that services account for only a small fraction of overall pollution, tourism is included in
the analysis. Tourists make use of many different service industries, mostly drawn from

14

NAICS codes 71 (Arts, entertainment, and recreation) and 72 (Accommodation and food
services). These industries are included in the calculation in Table 2 where I show that
services as a whole account for only 2.3 percent of carbon monoxide emissions, 0.93
percent of nitrogen oxide emissions, etc. And tourism is included in Table 3 where I
document the pollution intensity of various service industries. Though the table cannot
separate which hotel rooms and Broadway shows are purchased by tourists and which by
natives, that distinction is unimportant to make the point that services as a whole,
including tourism, contribute relatively little to overall pollution. So for this first part of
the analysis, the concern about tourism being omitted is misplaced.
Where the concern about omitted tourism rings true involves the second part of
the analysis, where I show that polluting services are less traded internationally. Tourism
is traded internationally, but the BEA data do not include most of those activities.5 So in
Table 4, tourism is not included in rows (2) and (4), listing the pollution intensity of
service industries for which the BEA published cross-border trade data. And in Table 5,
tourism is mostly omitted from the list of industries, and from the trade intensities in
column (1).
Does this omission weaken the claim that internationally traded services are less
polluting? No. Look at Table 3b, and assume that NAICS codes 71 and 72 are entirely
tourism and entirely traded internationally. Those two service industries are among the
least pollution intensive. Only information, education and health care are consistently
less pollution intensive. If I could somehow include tourism separately in Tables 4 and 5,
that would be one more highly traded relative clean industry, making the correlation
5

The BEA data includes cross-border expenditures on tour agencies and reservations, but not the direct
expenditures by foreign tourists on U.S. services, or services purchased by U.S. tourists abroad.

15

between trade intensity and pollution intensity even more negative. The concern about
tourism's omission therefore has no effect on the first conclusion, that services contribute
little to pollution, and makes the second conclusion even stronger, that traded services
pollute relatively less.

Conclusions
The analysis abstracts from several complications. Increased international trade
may increase the amount of transportation used as an input to many goods and services,
increasing their emissions. Some of the traded services may be aimed directly at
reducing pollution – environmental consulting, technology transfer, etc. And
international trade and investment may increase the scale of economic activity – for both
services and goods – and increase pollution accordingly. But these concerns depart from
the focus of this paper, which asks whether trade in services affects environmental quality
by changing the composition of industries in the exporting or importing countries.
Also, the focus here has been on conventional air pollutants. I cannot rule out the
possibility that had I focused instead on toxic air pollution, water pollution, or hazardous
waste, the conclusions might have been different.
The point here is simple. International trade has important links to the
environment, and service industries are important to international trade, but international
trade in services bear little relation to the environment. Why? Services contribute
relatively little to overall pollution, and those industries that are traded internationally are
among the least polluting.
