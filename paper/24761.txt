Benchmarking Portfolio Flows

NBER Working Paper No. 24761
June 2018
JEL No. F21,F3,G11
ABSTRACT
To gauge the amount of portfolio inflows a country can expect to receive, we create a benchmark,
a longer-term baseline path around which actual flows fluctuate. The relationship between our
benchmark and actual flows is quite strong for emerging market economies (EMEs). For our
sample of 28 EMEs, there is a significant long-run relationship between actual portfolio flows
and our benchmark, flows adjust strongly toward the benchmark, and our benchmark helps
predict one-year-ahead changes in inflows. For advanced economies (AEs), results are less
impressive, but again the benchmark performs well in directional forecasting exercises. In
practical terms, it is informative to distinguish between movements toward the benchmark as
opposed to movements away from the benchmark. An example: While portfolio inflows to both
Asian EMEs and Latin America plummeted in 2015, our benchmark analysis correctly predicted
that inflows should rebound in Asia (because flows had fallen far below the benchmark) but stay
near the new, low level in Latin America (where the sharp decline in inflows was back to
benchmark levels). We provide similar analysis for 45 countries, both advanced and emerging,
for the 2000 to 2017 period.

1. Introduction
In late 2016 many wondered whether the 2015/16 slowdown in capital flows represented a
post-crisis retreat from financial globalization or simply a temporary decline in cross-border flows.
Globally, annual portfolio inflows averaged only US$785 billion per year in 2015/16 (Table 1), well
below the average of the preceding five years and even below the amounts during the Global
Financial Crisis (GFC). For EMEs, 2015/16 inflows resembled the amounts received during the
GFC and were sharply lower than in the 2010-14 period (Figures 1 and 2).
But how does one judge, in real time, if a slowdown in flows is abnormal (suggesting it
might be temporary) or if the preceding period of elevated flows was abnormal (suggesting the
slowdown is actually the “new normal”)?
The analysis of international capital flows often compares flows in a recent period to flows
in some past period. For example, the entire sudden stops and surges literature (see Calvo (1998)
and Forbes and Warnock (2012) among many others) is built on a comparison of recent flows
against historical levels. Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), in documenting the Great Retrenchment of
capital flows, compare a pre-crisis period with the collapse and recovery periods, while IMF (2016)
focuses on the slowdown in flows during the 2010-15 period and the Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2017)
analysis of cross-border positions compares pre-crisis (2007) to their latest data point (2015). And
both Bussière, Schmidt and Valla (2016) and McQuade and Schmitz (2016) compare a pre-crisis
period with the more recent “new normal”.
The existing literature is rich in insights, but leaves readers wondering what level of capital
flows should be characterized as “normal”. Bussière et al. (2016, page 16), for example, concludes
that “it is hard to gauge if the pre-crisis properties and specificities of the various types of
flows…will prevail in the ‘new normal’….The changes that have taken place since the global

1

financial crisis may correspond to a simple normalization, as suggested…by Coeuré (2015), after
rather ‘exuberant’ times in the pre-crisis period.”
Temporal comparisons of capital flows would be enhanced if there was a benchmark that in
some sense defined “normal”. Conceptually, there can be many possible benchmarks, and no
obvious way to choose among them, but we would like our benchmark to be simple and intuitive
while providing a time-series reference to pin down low-frequency “normal” movements around
which actual flows will deviate. We prefer to stay clear of benchmarks that are purely statistical; we
are not interested in a benchmark that is derived from a statistical trend, nor in one that is overly
complicated and may perform well on the forecasting margin but is wholly unintuitive. Rather, we
would like a benchmark that builds upon a fundamental framework or stylized narrative and enables
some rationalization and explanation of why deviations from the benchmark are likely to be
transitory. Ideally, deviations from our benchmark should help forecast the medium-term path of
international capital flows.
An example of a benchmark in another strand of the international finance literature helps set
the stage. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is an accepted benchmark for exchange rates, at least
between advanced economies (AEs). PPP (and its building block, the law of one price) captures an
intuitive long-term arbitrage in product markets and enables a narrative based on a potential
mechanism of adjustment, rather than just an empirical trend. There is empirical evidence
supporting reversion to PPP (although deviations have a sizable half-life). And PPP is not unique
among exchange rate benchmarks; others include Balassa-Samuelson and FEER, and each
"benchmark" will produce a specific quantification of an exchange rate gap or misalignment.
Examples from the real side of the economy include benchmarks for economic activity (potential
GDP), unemployment (natural rate or NAIRU), and interest rates (the natural rate of interest, r*).
Each has origins in economic theory, each is an estimate subject to discussion and debate, and when
2

considering their pros and cons it can be said that each serves as a benchmark to which measured
data can be compared. PPP, potential GDP, NAIRU, and r* are worthy examples. What is an
appropriate benchmark for capital flows?
In this paper we create a benchmark. Our measure of benchmark portfolio flows is intuitive:
It is the amount of new money available for international capital flows (that is, rest-of-the-world
savings) allocated according to past portfolio weights. Our benchmark is also consistent with theory;
in particular, our benchmark is analogous to the Tille and van Wincoop (2010, henceforth TvW)
“portfolio growth” component of capital flows in which new savings is invested at steady state
portfolio shares. 1 The TvW portfolio growth component maps into a long-run benchmark
calculated as the amount of new funds available for investing—for portfolio investments, the
amount of new funds available to commit to investments (whether domestic or foreign) is this year’s
new savings—allocated according to some pre-determined rule analogous to TvW’s zero-order
portfolio weights. We create benchmark portfolio inflows for a wide range of countries (17 AEs and
28 EMEs) for the 2000-2017 period. We focus on portfolio flows—bond flows, equity flows, and
the sum of the two—because it is for portfolio flows that this notion of a benchmark is most
appropriate. 2
Thus, the amount of new funds available to invest (whether at home or abroad) is given by
the flow of new savings and benchmark flows are those new savings allocated using zero-order

1

Kraay and Ventura (2000, 2003) first proposed “portfolio growth” flows in an analysis of current account balances
(i.e., net capital flows). The Kraay and Ventura (2000, 2003) contributions to this literature are fundamental, but our
benchmark is more closely related to Tille and van Wincoop (2010) and their focus on gross flows.
2
Two things to note. One, while we have more than 17 AEs in our dataset, we collapse the Eurozone into one unit
and so have only 17 AE “countries”. Two, we hope that future work might create benchmark flows for other
components of international capital flows. For direct investment (DI), there is a natural analogy to our construction
of benchmark portfolio flows; we provide some thoughts on this in the conclusion. For banking flows, it is less clear
how to think about a benchmark (or even what BOP-based banking flows represent), but a step might be found in
McCauley et al. (2017).

portfolio weights. There are undoubtedly other plausible benchmarks. But, as we show graphically
and empirically, our benchmark has many desirable features.
As a preview, we show actual flows and our benchmark for two regions (Figure A).
Benchmark flows should not be mistaken as trend lines, as they are derived from investor countries’
macroeconomic conditions. They do appear to be a “natural line” or long-run anchor around which
actual flows oscillate. And what is apparent in the figure is also evident in empirical analysis, as we
will show that inflows—especially EME portfolio inflows—adjust to the benchmark both in sample
(as shown in error correction models) and out of sample (in year-by-year directional forecasts and in
model-based forecasts of recent flows).
Figure A. Benchmark and Actual Portfolio Inflows for EME Asia and Latin America
(annual, in billions of US$)

Having a benchmark provides context when investigating sharp movements in capital flows.
For example, EME Asia’s portfolio inflows plummeted from US$155 billion in 2014 to US$20
billion in 2015 (Figure A). Was the sharp decline in inflows surprising? Without a benchmark, one
4

can only state (and analyze) the extent of the slowdown compared with some previous period. But
Figure A reveals that the slowdown pushed EME Asia’s portfolio inflows below our benchmark,
suggesting that the 2015 slowdown would likely be reversed (which indeed occurred in 2016/17). In
contrast, the sharp 2015 decline in Latin America’s portfolio inflows was a return to benchmark
levels, so our analysis suggests that 2016 and 2017 flows should be similar to those in 2015, which
they were. The recent dynamics of portfolio inflows into Latin America and EME Asia highlight an
important feature of our analysis: Having a benchmark enables the differentiation of sharp
movements away from benchmark levels from sharp movements toward the benchmark. The former
(movements away from the benchmark) are likely temporary, whereas the latter (movements toward
the benchmark) are likely to be sustained.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses how we create benchmark flows, Section
3 compares actual and benchmark inflows through a series of graphs and descriptive analysis,
Section 4 presents statistical evidence on both the long-run relationship between actual and
benchmark inflows as well as the benchmark’s value in out-of-sample forecasting exercises, Section
5 presents some illustrative regressions of country-level deviations from the benchmark (i.e., the
difference between actual flows and benchmark flows), and Section 6 concludes.

2. Forming Benchmark Portfolio Flows
2.1 The Framework
In our opinion a benchmark should have the following features:
•

It should be simple and intuitive while providing a time-series reference to pin down lowfrequency “normal” movements around which actual flows will deviate.

5

•

It should build upon a fundamental framework or stylized narrative that enables some
rationalization and explanation of why deviations from the benchmark are likely to be
transitory.

•

Ideally, deviations from the benchmark should help forecast the medium-term path of flows.

The first two desirable characteristics push us toward a benchmark that is at least roughly consistent
with the Tille and van Wincoop (2010, TvW) notion of portfolio growth flows. TvW develop a twocountry dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model in which gross capital flows are
endogenous. For our purposes, an important feature of the TvW model is the notion of portfolio
growth flows: “The portfolio growth component captures capital flows that result when saving is
invested in line with the zero-order portfolio shares.” 3
This notion is intuitively appealing, as the flow of new savings is precisely the amount of new
funds available for foreign (or home) investment. Portfolio growth flows are simply the gross flows
that would occur if those new funds are allocated according to zero-order portfolio weights. Other
flows occur. In the language of TvW, actual gross flows are the sum of zero-order, first-order and
second-order flows. The zero-order flows, essentially the flows that would occur absent any shock
to expected returns and risk, are our benchmark. Shocks occur—in TvW first- and second-order
portfolio weights (and, hence, the related flows) are reallocations due to shocks in expected returns
and risk—and thus actual flows deviate from benchmark flows. But a plausible benchmark is one in
which new funds are allocated according to zero-order portfolio weights.

3

The quote is from page 163 of TvW. Two things to note. One, the portfolio allocation model of Devereux and
Sutherland (2011) has a similar zero-order steady-state notion. Two, the model in TvW is a two-country model and
hence says nothing directly about allocations across foreign markets, so our benchmark concept can best be
described as “in line with” TvW. Finally, see also Ahmed et al (2018) for a practical application that decomposes
gross portfolio outflows using the insights of TvW.

(2)

In (1) and (2) 𝜔𝜔𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,𝑡𝑡 , the bilateral portfolio weight between o and d (specifically, the weight of d in o’s

portfolio), can be formed using holdings data from the IMF’s CPIS dataset, which reports the
bilateral portfolio (bond and equity) holdings of about 60-80 origin countries starting in 2001.

Another way of forming country d’s total benchmark inflows is to use aggregate ROW (“rest
of the world”) data, where the weights are ωROW,d,t, or the weight of destination country d in ROW
portfolios:

= 𝜔𝜔𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅,𝑑𝑑,𝑡𝑡 𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅,𝑡𝑡

Portfolio weights in (3) can be formed using Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2017) data on the stock of
portfolio equity and portfolio debt liabilities, available annually for a wide range of countries starting
in roughly 1995. 4
Portfolio weights, whether using the bilateral approach (eq. 2) or the ROW approach (eq. 3),
also require data on savings and a scale factor for portfolios. For origin countries’ savings (in billions
of US$) we use data in IMF WEO; specifically, we multiply national savings rates by country-level
data on GDP in billions of current US$. To scale origin countries’ portfolios, we take a broad view
and consider each country’s stock of total financial assets (TFA), which is available from McKinsey
Global Institute (MGI). 5 Specifically, to create the size of a country’s portfolio, we add its net
foreign assets to its TFA, effectively subtracting out foreigners’ claims on the country’s TFA and
adding the country’s claims on other countries’ TFA. For the ROW version of our benchmark, we
simply subtract the destination country from global TFA and global savings. For example, the ROW
weight on Thailand’s equities equals the stock of Thailand’s portfolio equity liabilities (that is, ROW
holdings of Thai equities) divided by ROW total financial assets (global financial assets less the sum
of Thai financial assets and Thai net foreign assets).

2.2 The Details: Practical Choices when Forming a Benchmark
Equations (2) and (3) look simple enough but have a number of practical challenges that we
discuss in this subsection: how to create zero-order portfolio weights and whether to use the
bilateral or ROW approach (which in turn raises a question about how to deal with China).

4

The Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2017) data start earlier than 1995, but prior to 1995 there is dramatically reduced
country coverage.
5
Pulling primarily from publicly available sources, MGI calculates for a wide range of countries total financial
assets as the sum of a country’s equities, bonds and loans.

2.2.1 Zero-order Portfolio Weights
What exactly are the zero-order portfolio weights as of time t? In Devereux and Sutherland
(2011, pg. 350), zero-order portfolio holdings are “the equilibrium for portfolio holdings in a world
with an arbitrarily small amount of stochastic noise”. Similarly, in TvW the zero-order component is
the value when the volatility of shocks becomes arbitrarily small.
We want our benchmark to be useful in real time—it should provide information on the
amount of flows a destination country d should expect to receive this year—and we are also
constrained by data (as described below, we only have about two decades of annual data). Given
those considerations, a 5-year lagged moving average of portfolio weights seems in line with the
TvW and Devereux and Sutherland (2011) notion of zero-order weights.
In Figure B we illustrate, using the ROW approach, benchmarks a 5-year lagged moving
average of portfolio weights and two other weighting schemes: a simple one-period lagged weight
and a 3-year lagged moving average. The simple one-period lagged weight produces the most volatile
benchmark (the most volatile thin solid lines in Fig. B), but all three weighting schemes produce
broadly similar benchmark flows. We choose to calculate zero-order flows using a trailing 5-year
average of portfolio weights.
Figure B. Benchmarks using 1-, 3-, and 5-year lagged weights

2.2.2 ROW or Bilateral Approach
The above is straightforward enough: Define zero-order portfolio weights and apply them to
savings. Different researchers might make slightly different choices on those aspects when creating
their own preferred benchmark, but the resulting benchmarks will likely be quite similar.
The next decision is a bit more substantive: whether to use the ROW or bilateral approach.
There are pros and cons associated with both approaches. A strength of the bilateral approach is
that it attributes savings to origin countries according to each country’s exposure to the destination
country, which can be important if origin countries’ weights differ substantially for a particular
destination country. Weaknesses of the bilateral approach are that CPIS data exclude official
holdings (important for a reserve currency country like the US, but not for EMEs), have a
geographic bias due to the use of international financial centers, and do not include all of the world’s
origin countries. The omissions in the CPIS data are, in aggregate, substantial; as of end-2015 world
cross-border portfolio liabilities were $13.8 trillion greater in the LMF (2017) dataset than in the
CPIS data (Table A).

Much of difference is due to reserves, which as noted are excluded from the CPIS; the rest must
be due to the omission of some origin countries. Thus, one strength of the ROW approach is that it
doesn’t rely on bilateral data (which isn’t complete). In addition, the ROW approach is consistent
with BOP capital flows data (which are also ROW). In practice, the ROW approach (equation 3)
10

creates larger benchmark flows; see Figure C for EME Asia and Latin America. Note that for EMEs
the much lower CPIS-based benchmark cannot be due to the exclusion of reserves in the CPIS as
these countries do not typically receive reserve flows. Perhaps the low CPIS-based series is because
some source countries are not included in the CPIS dataset. Whatever the reason, after considering
the pros and cons of both approaches, we employ the ROW (LMF) approach and use equation (3)
to create benchmark flows. 6

2.2.3 The ROW Approach and China as a Source Country
Once the decision to use the ROW approach is made, China as a source country presents an
additional complication. The ROW approach assumes that all ROW savings are allocated in the
same way—specifically, according to ROW portfolio weights. One particular country for which this

6

For the Eurozone, to avoid double counting of within-union flows, we use Eurozone aggregates rather than
individual countries.
7
Note that in Figure C, for an apples-to-apples comparison and so we can start the figure in 2002 (the year after the
first broad CPIS dataset), we use a single lag of portfolio weights to form benchmark flows.

11

simplification can be problematic is China, which creates a large portion of world savings (27% in
2015) while having comparatively little outbound international portfolio investment. As of end-2015,
according to LMF (2017) data, China’s portfolio equity assets and portfolio debt assets were each
less than 1% of the global aggregates. And even if one adds its $3 trillion in reserves to its stock of
portfolio debt assets, China’s bond holdings are still only 10% of the global aggregate, quite small
for a country that generates a quarter of global savings.
To adjust for the disconnect between the importance of China in world savings and its
(limited) propensity to invest internationally we proceed in three steps:
•

Construct an “exChina” benchmark that excludes China from ROW savings, which
greatly reduces the amount of ROW funds available for cross-border investment.

•

Adjust flows for comparability of flows and the benchmark. Because China’s reserve
flows are included in recipient countries’ inbound portfolio flows BOP data, we also
need to reduce destination country actual bond inflows by an amount implied by
China’s overall reserve flows and COFER (Currency Composition of Official
Foreign Exchange Reserves) reserve currency weights. 8 This portion of our China
adjustment affects only seven ‘reserve currency’ countries—US, UK, Switzerland,
euro area, Japan, Australia and Canada—and in most years subtracts annual flows
ranging from to $11 billion in 2000 (across the entire group) to $480 billion in 2008.
In 2015 and 2016, when China’s reserves declined, this adjustment adds (across the
group of seven) $343 billion and $444 billion, respectively.

8

That is, we allocate China’s reserve flows according to the weight of reserve currencies in overall “allocated”
reserves; see the IMF’s COFER site for details. In addition, we assume the reserve flows are into bonds, although
some (presumably small) portion is also in equities, and we are identifying “country” with “currency”, although
clearly China could (for example) purchase USD-denominated bonds issued by entities in other countries.

12

•

Adjust ROW portfolio weights. For the seven reserve currency countries, we must
reduce the ROW’s weight on their bonds by China’s implied bilateral official
holdings.

The above three points constitute our “exChina” adjustment to benchmark and actual flows.
For all countries, removing China from ROW savings will reduce benchmark inflows. For reserve
currency countries, further adjustments are made to both benchmark and actual bond flows; actual
bond flows are reduced every year except 2015 and 2016.
Figure D shows benchmark and actual bond flows for the US, the country most affected by
China’s flows, using “exChina” series and raw series. With the exChina adjustment (Fig. D, left
graph), benchmark flows are less (because China’s savings are omitted and ROW’s weight on US
bonds are reduced) and actual flows are usually less (as we omit China’s implied reserve flows to the
US). For other countries the China adjustment is less pronounced.

Figure D. Benchmark and Actual Bond Flows to the US: With and Without a China Adjustment

without the exChina adjustment

Our China adjustment seems the best that can be done given limited information on China’s
bilateral official and private holdings, but is not perfect in that on a bilateral basis we can only
13

compute implied China official flows and positions and we cannot remove private China flows from
recipient countries’ BOP flows and, hence, our actual flows. 9 All things considered, our baseline
benchmark will use the exChina adjustment. 10

2.3 The Benchmark: Connection to Global GDP and a Decomposition
We note that regardless of practical choices that must be made when forming a benchmark,
our benchmark flows are directly connected to ROW economic conditions, arising (by construction)
from the flow of new ROW savings. The amount of new savings is of course closely related to
income—savings rates can vary year to year, but to a first approximation the level of savings is
driven by the level of income—so savings is highly correlated with GDP whether in levels (both are
flow concepts) or first differences (Figure 3). Thus, benchmark portfolio inflows for each country
will be closely related to ROW GDP, providing a baseline path that is connected to ROW
macroeconomic conditions.
A reasonable question is which component—changes in ROW portfolio weights or the
evolution of new ROW savings—drives changes in our benchmark. The answer, shown in the last
graph of Figure 3, is both. From 2000 to 2017, benchmark inflows, summed across all countries in
our sample, increased by $2726 billion from $790 billion to $3516 billion. Fixing portfolio weights at
2000 levels (actually, the average of 1995-1999, as our benchmark uses a 5-year trailing average)
allows us to compute the amount of that increase that comes from the evolution of ROW savings

9

China started reporting to the CPIS dataset in 2015, so there is no obvious way to strip out China’s private
portfolio flows back to 2000. We do not believe the inability to exclude China’s private flows impacts our analysis
much, as the entire stock of China’s outbound private portfolio investment—the type of positions picked up by the
CPIS—amounted to only $261 billion as of 2015, with much of that being invested in the US, Europe and Japan.
Compared to its over $3 trillion in official reserves, China’s reported private portfolio holdings are quite small.
10
As we note in the conclusion, while the adjustment certainly affects analysis of flows into at least one country (the
US), none of our empirical results (presented in Sections 4 and 5) is materially affected by the exChina adjustment;
that is, the discussion of our empirical results does not hinge on using data with the exChina adjustment as opposed
to raw unadjusted data.

14

(depicted as the “fixed weight” dashed line in the last panel of Fig. 3). The “fixed weight”
benchmark increased $1181 billion over the 2000-2017 period, meaning that increased ROW
portfolio weights (from 10.6% in 2000 to 18.8% in 2017, which is one manifestation of the erosion
of the long-standing home bias) accounted for $1545 billion (or 57%) of the increase. Both
increased ROW portfolio weights and increased global savings have increased our benchmark flows.

3. Comparing Actual and Benchmark Portfolio Flows
Figure 4 shows, for total portfolio (i.e., bond and equity combined) and, separately, for
equity and bond flows, actual (the thin line) inflows and benchmark inflows (the thicker line).
Benchmarks are based on a 5-year lagged moving average of portfolio weights and for both actual
and benchmark we use the “exChina” adjustment. Graphs are presented for EME Asia, Latin
America, US, Eurozone, EME Other and AE Other (see Table 1 for the composition of groups) for
the period from 2000 to 2017.
The various graphs in Figure 4 indicate a few regularities of benchmark inflows. One, they
are positive; for benchmark flows to any country to be negative, annual ROW savings would have to
be negative. Two, while benchmark portfolio inflows declined during the global financial crisis
(because ROW savings fell), over time they tend to increase; absent a surge in home bias, an
expanding global economy and increasing global savings increase benchmark flows.

EME Asia
Actual portfolio flows to EME Asia were running higher than the benchmark in the years
prior to the GFC—the thin line (actual flows) line in Figure 4 was above the thick line (benchmark
flows) line through 2007—consistent with the elevated number of sudden surges (Forbes and
Warnock 2012) during that period. Actual portfolio flows to EME Asia decreased sharply during the
15

GFC, the Great Retrenchment documented in Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011). Following the GFC
portfolio inflows were again elevated, until they fell sharply in 2015 to below-benchmark levels. If
our benchmark is a reasonable long-run measure, we would expect portfolio inflows to EME Asia to
rebound from the very low 2015 levels, and in subsequent years they have.
Turning to the components, we note that EME Asia’s bond inflows have been elevated
almost every year since 2003, with the only exceptions being during the GFC and in the 2015
slowdown. The 2015 slowdown in EME Asia’s bond inflows was a return to benchmark following
much higher than benchmark inflows during the 2010 to 2014 period; here we would have expected
EME Asia bond inflows to remain near the 2015 levels, but in the event they increased sharply (due
to large inflows into Chinese and Indonesian bonds). In sharp contrast are EME Asia’s equity
inflows which, while elevated pre-GFC, then oscillated around the benchmark before falling sharply
to below benchmark levels in 2015.
In sum, the 2015 sharp slowdown in EME Asia portfolio inflows appears to have been a
temporary deviation from longer-term benchmark levels, largely because equity inflows fell far
below the benchmark, and thus our analysis suggests inflows should rebound. Flows did rebound
somewhat in 2016 and dramatically in 2017 due to a surge in bond inflows. Going forward, based on
our benchmark analysis, we expect equity flows into EME Asia to increase, bond inflows to
decrease, and overall portfolio inflows to decrease.

Latin America
Latin American portfolio inflows fell sharply in 2015/16, but for this region we expect
inflows to remain near current levels as recent Latin American portfolio inflows are in line with the
benchmark. The decline in Latin American inflows is solely due to a sharp drop in bond inflows
from the elevated level of 2010-14 to near benchmark levels, while equity inflows are slightly below
16

benchmark. Overall, with actual flows close to benchmark levels, we expect LatAm inflows to
remain near current levels.

US and Eurozone
Since the beginning of the Eurozone debt crisis and QE programs, inflows in both the US
and Eurozone have tended to stay below benchmark levels. For the Eurozone, the low level of
inflows is due to bond flows—Eurozone bond inflows were negative US$200 billion in 2017 when
the benchmark suggested US$200 billion in inflows—while equity inflows have recently rebounded.
For the US, bond inflows were quite low starting in the GFC and rebounded in 2012, whereas equity
inflows stayed near benchmark levels following the crisis but then fell substantially in 2013. Overall,
in 2017 the US received the benchmark amount of portfolio inflows, so while we expect bond
inflows to decrease and equity inflows to increase, the overall level of US portfolio inflows seems to
be a return to normal.

Other EMEs and Other AEs
Both of our “other” groups, which contain a number of important countries not elsewhere
classified, are experiencing near benchmark portfolio inflows, with below benchmark equity inflows
roughly offsetting above benchmark bond inflows. As such, we expect overall portfolio inflows to
both sets of countries to maintain current levels with equity inflows increasing and bond inflows
decreasing. More details on selected countries are provided next.

Selected Individual Countries
Country groupings can mask heterogeneity across countries, so in the appendix we present
benchmark and actual flows for selected countries (grouped by regions). Some countries (Australia,
17

UK, Mexico, and Poland) are at about benchmark levels for portfolio inflows and both components
(bonds and equities). Countries below benchmark for portfolio inflows and both components
include Brazil and Philippines, while countries at or above all their benchmarks are Canada,
Argentina, China, South Africa and Turkey. Some countries (India, Indonesia, Thailand) are
currently receiving large bond inflows that more than offset decreased equity inflows (and hence, in
sum, they are receiving sizeable portfolio inflows). Finally, Japan and Russia are currently receiving
benchmark-level portfolio inflows as strong bond inflows offset weaker equity inflows, while
portfolio inflows into South Korea and New Zealand are below benchmark levels.
4. Empirical Evidence on the Relationship between Actual and Benchmark Portfolio Flows
The descriptive comparison of actual and benchmark flows provided in Section 3 suggests
that benchmark flows can be thought of as a longer-term baseline path around which actual flows
fluctuate. In this section we empirically evaluate the benchmark in two ways. First, we provide
formal tests of our benchmark’s long-run relationship with actual portfolio flows by conducting
panel cointegration tests and estimating error correction models (with particular interest in their
long-run coefficients and speed of adjustment parameters). Second, we assess the benchmark’s
performance in generating two types of out-of-sample forecasts, one model based (based on the
error correction model) and another directional.

4.1 Long-run Relationship between Actual and Benchmark Portfolio Flows
Analogous to the PPP literature, we begin by evaluating whether actual and benchmark
flows are cointegrated. Table 2 provides results from two panel cointegration tests: Kao (1999) tests
that assume a common cointegrating vector and AR parameter across panels (top panel) and
Pedroni (1999, 2004) tests that allow for panel specific cointegrating vectors and AR parameters

18

(bottom panel). Each test has a null hypothesis of no cointegration, and we include panel fixed
effects while demeaning across panels to control for cross-sectional dependence. These tests have
relatively low power for samples of our size (in particular the limited time dimension) but provide a
useful starting point to evaluate the proposed benchmark.
The Kao and Pedroni panel cointegration tests each provide evidence that total portfolio
flows are cointegrated with the benchmark. Splitting by asset class provides mixed results as the Kao
tests provide stronger evidence of cointegration for bond flows, while Pedroni tests suggest equity
rather than bond flows are cointegrated with the benchmark. Looking at the AE/EME splits, the
Pedroni tests provide stronger evidence of cointegration for the EME sub-sample.
While Table 2 results provide evidence that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship
between actual and benchmark portfolio flows, one could argue that cointegration is a necessary but
not a sufficient condition for a suitable benchmark. More compelling evidence requires the use of
error correction models to estimate the long-run relationship and the degree to which actual flows
revert to the benchmark. Given the cointegration results in Table 2—in particular, the mixed results
for the components but strong results for total portfolio flows—we focus on total portfolio flows
and estimate pooled mean group models of the form:

∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ∆𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + λ𝑖𝑖 �𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝜃𝜃𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 � + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(4)

The pooled mean group estimator of Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999) constrains the long-run
coefficient θ to be constant across panels but allows for country-specific error correction terms (λi).
Table 3 provides estimates for the long-run coefficient θ on benchmark portfolio flows where the
coefficient on actual portfolio flows has been normalized to 1 (as in equation 4). A strong form test

19

of the benchmark, analogous to absolute PPP, would require θ = 1 and imply stationarity of the
absolute difference between actual and benchmark flows.
The strongest evidence in Table 3 is for EMEs, which perhaps is to be expected given the
visual descriptive evidence and statistical cointegration tests. For the EME sub-sample (column 3),
we estimate θ = 0.976, and a chi-square test fails to reject the null of θ=1, providing strong evidence
of a long-run relationship between the benchmark and actual portfolio flows. The speed of
adjustment parameter is negative and highly significant (λ=-0.751), suggesting that portfolio flows
rapidly revert toward the benchmark. 11 The error correction coefficient reported in column (3),
suggests, for example, that an EME experiencing portfolio inflows that exceed benchmark flows by
$10 billion should expect, ceteris paribus, a decline in flows of $7.51 billion in the following year. To
gauge whether the benchmark adjusts to flows, in column (4) we re-estimate the error correction
model for the EME sub-sample but with the change in benchmark flows as the dependent variable.
The positive and significant coefficient on the error correction term (λ=0.034) indicates that the
benchmark responds positively to close the gap with actual flows, but the size of the coefficient is
much smaller than in column (3), suggesting that the bulk of the adjustment is actual flows moving
toward the benchmark.
Results for the full sample (column 1) and the AE sub-sample (column 2) are weaker. For
the full sample, we estimate θ=0.283 and strongly reject a null hypothesis of θ=1. In the AE subsample (column 2) θ is insignificantly different from zero. Error correction terms are still large,
negative and statistically significant, but the fact that θ is quite small (full sample) or insignificantly
different from zero (AE sample) calls into question the error correction model for these samples. In
contrast, for the EME sub-sample we find strong evidence of a significant long-term relationship

In Table 3, for ease of presentation we report the cross-panel average of λi. The panel specific estimates for λ is
negative and statistically significant (at the 5% level) for 22 of the 28 EMEs in our sample.

between flows and our benchmark. In particular, for EMEs portfolio flows adjust to close the
previous period’s gap between flows and the benchmark.

4.2 Using the Benchmark to Forecast Portfolio Flows
In the descriptive comparison of actual and benchmark flows conducted in Section 3, we
suggest that the deviation between actual flows and the benchmark helps predict future flows. In
Section 4.1 we provide econometric evidence for that predictive power in the EME sample, based
on a statistically and economically significant cointegrating relationship between our benchmark and
actual portfolio flows. A natural next step is to test the out-of-sample forecasting ability of the
benchmark. We do this in two ways. First, we create model-based out-of-sample forecasts by
estimating the error correction model through 2014 and then forecasting flows for 2015, 2016 and
2017. Second, we evaluate the benchmark’s performance in a directional forecasting exercise; that is,
we test if the benchmark by itself is valuable in predicting whether inflows in the subsequent year
will increase or decrease.

4.2.1 Model-based Out-of-Sample Forecasts for EME Portfolio Flows
Our short sample of just 18 annual data points hinders our ability to evaluate model-based
out-of-sample forecasts. But we do so. Specifically, we re-estimate the pooled mean group error
correction model from column (3) of Table 3 using part of the sample (2000-2014) to capture the
average speed of adjustment parameter (λ) and then apply that estimated λ to predict flows for the
remaining years of data (2015, 2016, and 2017). Although the out-of-sample portion of this exercise
is quite limited, it does include the 2015-2016 slowdown and the 2017 bounce back, periods that
might be considered difficult to predict.
We calculate the one-period-ahead forecast for the change in portfolio flows as follows:
21

∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = −0.694�𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑏𝑏𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 �

(5)

where λ=-0.694 is from the model in Table 3 (column 3) estimated over the 2000-2014 period. Note
that (5) is not truly out of sample as we use the actual lagged deviation of flows from the
benchmark; that is, to predict 2016 flows we use the 2015 deviation of flows from the benchmark
(times the adjustment parameter).
Figure 5a presents a scatterplot of the actual v. predicted change in portfolio flows for
EMEs during the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 (that is, 3 years for 28 EMEs or 84 observations in all).
The scatter plot reveals an impressive performance of the error correction forecasting model; the
correlation between actual and forecasted change in flows is 0.57 and most (59 of 84) observations
lie in the first and third quadrants (in which the forecasted and actual changes have the same sign).
We also do the same exercise for 2017 using λ=-0.744, the estimate using data from 2000 to 2016.
While the fit is less impressive (Figure 5b, correlation between actual and forecast is 0.13) because of
two outliers in the fourth quadrant—the model predicted that portfolio inflows received by both
China and Argentina would decrease in 2017 but they did not—in 20 of the 28 cases the modelbased forecast got the sign correct.

4.2.2 Directional Forecasts
In many cases directional forecasts—forecasts of the direction of a change in an economic
variable—can add considerable value, regardless of the statistical precision of the forecast. For
example, Leitch and Tanner (1991) argue that the value of forecasts to firms hinges on whether they
can increase profits, not whether the forecast’s root-mean-squared error is small. Similarly, Merton
(1981) notes that for evaluating market-timing performance, what matters is if the forecast correctly
predicts which will outperform, stocks or bonds, rather than the magnitude of the outperformance.
22

Schnader and Stekler (1990) extend Merton (1981) to assess the value of forecasts of whether
economic growth will slow or accelerate. In our context policy makers and market participants might
value the ability to forecast whether portfolio flows received by a particular country are likely to
increase or decrease from current levels.
We next evaluate our benchmark’s performance in a directional forecasting exercise. We can
construct a simple benchmark-based forecast of the direction of the change in portfolio flows by
assuming that flows will adjust toward the benchmark. Specifically, the benchmark-based forecast of
next period’s change in flows is given by:

∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = −�𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 �

(6)

Forecast equation (6), a simplified version of equation (5) in which we no longer rely on the
estimated value of the error correction term, uses only predetermined variables and does not require
any estimated coefficients, so we are free from the constraints of a typical out-of-sample forecast
and can make a full set of forecasts for our entire sample period. To evaluate the ability of the
benchmark to correctly predict the direction of the change in portfolio inflows, we employ the
Pesaran and Timmermann (1992) non-parametric test of predictive failure, which in our case is also
a test of whether actual and forecasted changes are independently distributed. If our benchmark
predicts the direction of change in portfolio inflows in significantly more than 50 percent of the
cases, where significance is assessed using the Pesaran-Timmermann (P-T) statistic, we can reject
predictive failure (and the independence of actual and predicted changes) and conclude that the
benchmark is useful in predicting flows.
The benchmark performs quite well. For 64% of the 474 EME observations the benchmark
correctly forecasts the direction of the change in portfolio inflows (top half of Table 4). This
23

performance is statistically significant, as the P-T test statistic of 6.35 strongly rejects the null
hypothesis of predictive failure (and the independence of actual and forecasted changes). For AEs
and in the full sample the benchmark also performs well, correctly forecasting the direction of the
change in portfolio flows for 67% of the AE 289 observations of 65% of all observations.
The benchmark performs well in these one-period-ahead forecasts of directional change, but
one must wonder if a simple alternative forecast of reversion—a prediction that the change in flows
this period will be the opposite sign of the change in flows last period—also performs well. The
reversion forecast (bottom half of Table 4) has directional predictive power, correct 57%, 65% and
61%, respectively, for EMEs, AE, and the full sample. That said, all of the percent correct and P-T
statistics are higher for the benchmark forecast. 12

5. The Determinants of Deviations from the Benchmark
Our benchmark flows are analogous to the TvW zero-order flows, but in the language of
TvW first-order and second-order shocks push actual flows away from the zero-order flows. In
TvW these shocks are associated with factors that would lead to changes in expectations of returns
and risk. We next provide a cursory empirical investigation into deviations from our benchmark,
including a standard set of explanatory variables that are at least loosely related to TvW’s first- and
second-order shocks.
Specifically, to ascertain which factors are associated with short-term deviations in capital
inflows from the benchmark—that is, the gap between actual and benchmark inflows—we estimate
fixed effects panel regressions in an annual panel dataset that spans 2000 to 2015 and includes 19
EMEs (Table 5). The dependent variable, defined as the deviation (i.e., actual minus benchmark)

12

Table 4 shows only total portfolio flows, but in untabulated results we note that the benchmark also performs well
(at the 1% significance level) for the bond and equity components.

24

divided by GDP, is for portfolio inflows, bond inflows, or equity inflows as indicated in column
headings. Independent variables include a parsimonious set of local variables—economic growth,
the IMF’s inflation forecast, MSCI equity returns, and capital controls—and some global variables
(U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, BBB-AAA risk spread, and the VIX). 13 While we view these regressions
as illustrative and not definitive, the results suggest that higher than normal EME portfolio inflows
occur when growth is strong, equity returns are high, and US Treasury yields and risk measures
(BBB-AAA spread or VIX) are low. Splitting by asset class we find that high equity returns are
associated with stronger than normal equity inflows while US Treasury yields and risk measures are
more closely linked to bond flows. 14

6. Conclusion
In this paper we frame portfolio flows as fluctuating around some benchmark level. While
various notions of benchmark flows are reasonable, our preferred benchmark is simply the amount
of flows created if new ROW funds available for investments of any sort (i.e., new ROW savings)
are allocated according to lagged portfolio weights, analogous to the Tille and van Wincoop (2010)
notion of portfolio growth flows. 15
Our benchmark flows, which arise from ROW macroeconomic conditions, represent the
flows that recipient countries should expect regardless of what occurs in the local economy. Of

13

Capital controls, from Fernandez et al (2016) and specific to the type of inflow (portfolio, bond or equity), are
only available through 2015 and thus dictate the end date in the Table 5 regressions. Inflation forecast is a
component of the IMF (2016) real policy rate variable.
14
The sample in Table 4 is limited to 19 EMEs based on the availability of equity returns. Excluding equity returns
allows the addition of other EMEs like Panama and Uruguay to bring the sample to 26 EMEs; this larger sample
generates a qualitatively similar set of results for the other explanatory variables, although we fail to find a
significant impact of risk measures on total portfolio flows.
15
The reader will note that our preferred benchmark involves an adjustment for China. While we think that
adjustment is reasonable and it certainly changes the analysis for at least one country (the US, as shown in Fig. D),
none of our empirical results are materially affected by the adjustment. That is, if we conduct all empirical tests
using unadjusted data, results for Tables 2-5 and for the model-based out-of-sample forecasts (Fig. 5) are quite
similar to the exChina results shown in the paper.

25

course, actual inflows often deviate from benchmark flows—perhaps because of changes in local or
global conditions—but benchmark flows appear to be a longer-term baseline path around which
actual flows oscillate. The relationship between our benchmark and actual flows seems strongest in
EMEs. For our sample of 28 EMEs, error correction models suggest that actual portfolio flows
adjust strongly toward the benchmark and the benchmark performs well in out-of-sample forecasts
of flows.
Overall, both our graphical and empirical results indicate that a comparison of actual and
benchmark flows provides a way to ascertain whether sharp slowdowns in capital flows are likely
temporary or long-lasting. For example, EME Asia’s portfolio inflows plummeted from US$155
billion in 2014 to US$20 billion in 2015, far below our benchmark, suggesting that the 2015
slowdown would likely be reversed (which indeed occurred in 2016/17). In contrast, the sharp 2015
decline in Latin America’s portfolio inflows was a return to benchmark levels, so our analysis
suggests that 2016 and 2017 flows should be similar to those in 2015 (which they were). In general,
our analysis enables the differentiation of sharp movements away from benchmark levels from sharp
movements toward the benchmark. The former (movements away from the benchmark) are likely
temporary, whereas the latter (movements toward the benchmark) are likely to be sustained.
Our analysis is also relevant for the current debate on the existence of a global financial cycle
(see, for example, Rey (2013) and Cerutti, Claessens and Rose (2017) for two views). Our
benchmark flows are tightly connected to ROW GDP, suggesting they are also related to the global
business cycle; see Lumsdaine and Prasad (2003), Kose, Otrok and Whiteman (2003), Kose, Otrok,
and Prasad (2012), and Ductor and Leiva-Leon (2016), among many others, on comovements in
GDP across large economies. By extension, to the extent there is something that can be called a
global business cycle, our benchmark suggests there is, at least for benchmark flows, a global capital
flow cycle. Actual flows deviate from the benchmark and these deviations may well explain the
26

variation in flows (in an R2 sense), but the level of flows appears to be very much driven by
benchmark flows (which are tied to ROW global macro conditions).
We close by urging others to conduct similar analysis of other types of capital flows. For
direct investment, applying our basic notion seems feasible. New funds available for DI are
corporate earnings—yes, companies can borrow to fund M&A activity, but new funds come from
the flow of corporate earnings—and thus to create benchmark DI flows one just needs to decide on
a pre-determined allocation rule. Similarly, we urge experts on banking flows to create benchmarks.

Table 3. Pooled Mean Group Error Correction Models
The table presents results from pooled mean group error correction regressions of the form ∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =
𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ∆𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + λ𝑖𝑖 �𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝜃𝜃𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 � + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , estimated for the sample period 2000-2017. In
the final column the error correction model is flipped such that Δbmarkt is the dependent variable. The model
estimates panel specific error correction terms (λ𝑖𝑖 ); we report the cross-panel average. Standard errors are in
parentheses; ***, **, and * denote significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Table 4. Directional Forecasting
The table presents results from the Pesaran-Timmermann (1992) non-parametric test for the accuracy of a
directional forecast for the period from 2001 through 2017. The benchmark (BM) gap forecast is formed by
∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = −�𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 − 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 �. The “Reversion” forecast predicts the change in flows this
period will be the opposite of the change in flows last period: ∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = −�∆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 �. In each case

we present the fraction of observations for which the forecast correctly predicts the sign of ∆flows (% correct)
and the Pesaran-Timmermann (P-T) statistic, which is distributed normally and has a null hypothesis of no
directional predictive power. The 1% critical value for the P-T test is 2.33. The EME sample has two
observations fewer than 17 times 28 because we do not have 2000 benchmark amounts for Kuwait and
Romania.

Table 5. Determinants of Deviations: EMEs
Fixed effects panel regressions use an annual panel dataset that spans 2000 to 2015 and includes 19 EMEs.
The dependent variable, defined as the deviation (i.e., actual minus benchmark) divided by GDP, is for
portfolio inflows, bond inflows, or equity inflows as indicated in column headings. Independent variables
include local variables (economic growth, IMF inflation forecast, MSCI equity returns, and capital controls)
and global variables (U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, BBB-AAA risk spread, and the VIX). Constants are included
but not reported. Robust standard errors, clustered at the country level, are reported in parentheses. ***, **
and * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.

Benchmark flows in this figure use the ROW approach with the exChina adjustment and a trailing 5-year
average for portfolio weights. “Global” is the set of countries in our full sample. The final chart depicts
benchmark flows along with its amount if portfolio weights were held constant at 2000 levels.
