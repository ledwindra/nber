    "abstract": "\n\nThe lifecycle labor supply model has been proposed as an explanation for various dimensions of labor supply, including movements over the business cycle, changes with age, and within-person variation over time. According to the model, all of these elements are tied together by a combination of intertemporal substitution effects and wealth effects. This paper offers an assessment of the model's ability to explain the main components of labor supply, focusing on microeconomic evidence for men.\n\n",
