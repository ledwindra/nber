Ethnic Inequality and Poverty in Malaysia Since 1969
Martin Ravallion
NBER Working Paper No. 25640
March 2019
JEL No. I32,O15,O53
ABSTRACT
Ethnic riots broke out in Malaysia in 1969, prompting a national effort at affirmative action
favoring the poorer (majority) of “Bumiputera” (mainly Malays). Since then, Malaysia’s official
poverty measures indicate one of the fastest long-term rates of poverty reduction in the world,
due to both economic growth and falling inequality. Did ethnic inequality fall since 1969 and was
that a key factor in the country’s success in reducing poverty and in managing inequality? New
measures in this paper indicate a substantial decline in relative ethnic inequality. This brought
down national relative inequality, though not enough to prevent rising absolute inequality, given
the initial disparities. A new analytic decomposition of the rate of poverty reduction reveals that
ethnic redistribution helped reduce poverty, although it was not as important as the overall rate of
growth in household incomes. Despite past progress in reducing ethnic inequality, the
responsiveness of the national poverty rate to ethnic redistribution remains high even today.

Introduction
Many countries face troubling ethnic/racial disparities in living standards. In striving to

reduce poverty and keep overall inequality in check, the question arises as to what role explicit
efforts to reduce ethnic disparities can play in national poverty reduction, and in managing
inequality. This paper studies the post-independence economic history of the developing country
that is probably the most famous example of policy efforts at ethnic redistribution, Malaysia.
Indeed, it is hard to think of any country where ethnic inequality has been a bigger issue, or the
policies more contentious. Some observers have seen the country’s efforts to reduce ethnic
inequality as crucial to overall social welfare and (especially) progress against poverty, while to
others, affirmative action (such as in education) has been seen as “a blatant form of racial
discrimination” (Raman and Sua, 2010, p.130).
Malaysia’s colonial legacy had left both high inequality—with a marked ethnic
dimension—and high poverty—with an especially high incidence of poverty among the ethnic
majority, the Malay people and other (non-Malay) “Bumiputera.” The other main ethnic groups
are those with “Chinese” and “Indian” origins (though almost all born in Malaysia). Ethnic
conflict in the decade or so after Independence in 1957 culminated in the tragic Sino-Malay race
riots of May 1969. A dramatic policy response was announced in 1970—the “New Economic
Policy” (NEP). 2 The distinctive feature was the extra effort at affirmative action, such that the
Bumiputera were to receive favorable treatment in access to education, housing, public-sector
hiring, and corporate share ownership. The NEP started in 1971, but it became sharper in 1975
when its conditions on Bumiputera share ownership and employment quotas became mandatory
for all but small companies (Drabble, 2000, Ch.10). The official policy lasted 20 years, but had
continuing influence after that.
Poverty reduction was a core aim of the NEP. In 1970, the official poverty rate (discussed
further below) was about 50%, and almost two-thirds of the Bumiputera lived in poverty at that
time. Poverty was not the only motivation for the NEP. Such ethnically-grounded policies can be
defended from multiple perspectives, including as means for promoting social solidarity and
counteracting discrimination by ethnicity. These goals may be seen as relevant to poverty but

The riots followed a general election that saw electoral gains to new opposition parties, dominated by Malaysian
Chinese, relative to the governing political coalition (the multi-ethnic Alliance Party). The riots prompted a state of
emergency and the suspension of Parliament, which lasted two years.

also as independent issues. Nonetheless, it is clear that in Malaysia around 1970, poverty was a
major concern, and ethnic inequality was widely seen as an important cause.
Malaysia has made huge progress against poverty over the last 50 years. The official
poverty rate has fallen to well under 1%—a compound rate of decline of 10% per annum since
1969! It is important to learn how Malaysia did this. Thankfully, we have data from 18
reasonably comparable, nationally representative, household surveys to draw on. 3 A natural
question to ask of these data is what role the ethnically-grounded policy regime had in the
country’s success against poverty.
Given that the NEP’s intended beneficiaries were the poorest ethnic group, who were
very poor at the time, it might be expected that the policy helped reduce poverty. That appears to
have been the expectation of policy makers, and has been heard often since. 4 However, the case
for that view remains far from clear. One issue is just how much ethnic redistribution has really
happened, and how much it helped reduce overall inequality. Casual observations are frequent,
but the literature is largely silent on quantitative magnitudes. There is a widespread casual view
that since 1969 “the gap in income between Malays … and Chinese- and Indian-Malaysians has
narrowed dramatically.” (Economist, 2017). Is that right? The Bumiputera may have seen higher
growth rates in mean incomes than other ethnic groups, but that does not imply that “the gap …
has narrowed” (even if not “dramatically”). If the initial inequality is high enough, relative
inequality can fall while absolute inequality rises. Indeed, the evidence across countries suggests
that this is quite common (Ravallion, 2018).
A second issue is how much the attained ethnic redistribution contributed to the country’s
(impressive) poverty reduction. One also hears claims that “The most remarkable achievement of
the NEP was in the reduction in poverty” (Khalid, 2014). 5 Is that right? It is easy to imagine a
theoretical scenario in which the gains to the poorer ethnic group are largely captured by the nonpoor within that group, while the poor in the donor group lose out. Then ethnic redistribution—
interpreted as bringing group-mean incomes closer—will come with a higher national poverty
rate. More generally, consider the effect on the national poverty rate (𝐻𝐻) of a redistribution of
income from group j (with mean 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 , population share 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗 and poverty rate 𝐻𝐻𝑗𝑗 ) to group i, holding
One would clearly like to have more observations, but that is all that we have since 1969 and with a poverty rate of
nearly zero now there is not much gain from waiting for more.

Recent examples can be found in both Khalid (2014) and Thillainathan and Cheong (2016).

that 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗 𝑑𝑑𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 = 0). Only knowing that 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 > 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 and 𝐻𝐻𝑗𝑗 < 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 does not tell us the sign of the

inter-ethnic difference in the marginal impacts of a higher group-mean income on poverty, and
(hence) the impact on the national poverty rate of lower ethnic inequality.
Critics of the NEP have pointed to the fact that a large share of inequality is within

ethnic groups, rather than between them. 6 By this view, ethnic inequality is a specific instance of
the “between-group” component in a decomposition of overall inequality. It can be debated
whether the salience of ethnic/racial inequality is well reflected in such a decomposition
(Kanbur, 2006); a small difference between ethnic groups may matter a lot more than a similar
difference within a given group. However, even accepting the “between-group inequality”
interpretation, a static inequality decomposition cannot (of course) tell us how inequality evolves
over time, and it cannot tell us that policies aimed at reducing ethnic inequalities will be
ineffective against poverty, which depends on how levels of living respond. Ethnic redistribution
can change inequalities within groups, with ambiguous implications for national poverty
measures.
Yet even without changes in within-group distribution, there is nothing to guarantee that
ethnic redistribution reduces national poverty. To give a simple numerical example, suppose that
the poorer group has three people with incomes (1, 2, 3) (with mean 2), while the richer group
has (1, 3, 8) (mean 4). The poverty line is 2.5, so the aggregate poverty rate is 50%. A 10% “tax”
is now levied on the richer group and is used to raise the mean of the poorer group, keeping the
relative distribution constant within each. Then the new distributions are (1.2, 2.4, 3.6) (with
mean 2.4) and (0.9, 2.7, 7.2) (with mean 3.6). Ethnic inequality has been reduced but the poverty
rate has stayed the same, at 50%. Generalizing this example to the prior case of continuous
distributions, now hold the Lorenz curves constant within groups i and j. One can readily show

6
An influential volume by Anand (1983) found that only 13% of total inequality (measured using a Theil index) in
1970 is between ethnic groups. Also see the comments in Thillainathan and Cheong (2018) (reviewing Khalid,
2014) who use the evidence on inequality decompositions to question the effectiveness of the NEP.
7
This uses the fact that the poverty rate, H, is homogeneous of degree zero between the mean and the poverty line
for a given Lorenz curve (Gastwirth, 1971). The poverty line is taken to be constant.

4

The necessary (and sufficient) condition for national poverty to fall with (mean-preserving)
ethnic redistribution is that the ratio of the density at the poverty line to the mean is lower for the
donor group than for the recipient.
The upshot of these observations is that it is far from obvious how much the ethnicallygrounded policy regime since 1969 has mattered to the evolution of Malaysia’s poverty
measures. Further research is needed.
There is little hope of rigorously identifying the NEP’s causal impact on aggregate
poverty and inequality. We cannot observe Malaysia in the absence of the NEP. Nor do we have
sufficient time series of distributions prior to the NEP to allow reflexive comparison. Rather than
evaluating the NEP, this paper addresses some less ambitious but still important questions
relevant to understanding the role of ethnic inequality in progress against poverty. Specifically:
•

Have we seen falling ethnic inequality in Malaysia since 1969? Have the gaps narrowed,
as widely believed? How much has this helped reduce national inequality?

•

How much did lower ethnic inequality contribute to Malaysia’s success against poverty
nationally?

•

Have any gains from ethnic redistribution as a means of reducing poverty been largely
exhausted after 50 years? Or is there still some potential left?
The paper first looks at some aspects of Malaysia’s economic history, drawing on the

literature. Then Section 3 describes the country’s progress in reducing inequality and poverty,
drawing mainly on data from household surveys spanning 1970-2016. Section 4 uses
decomposition tools to assess the contribution of lower ethnic inequality to poverty reduction,
and the responsiveness of national poverty to ethnic redistribution. Section 5 concludes.

2.

An historical perspective on ethnic inequality in Malaysia
The historical record suggests that the ethnic inequality found in Malaysia at the time of

Independence was in no small measure a legacy of colonialism. The British rulers clearly
favored non-Malays in the lucrative new cash-crop and non-farm sectors. This reflected a
paternalistic attitude toward the Malay people, who appear to have been viewed as only being
well suited to paddy farming, despite the fact that Malays themselves were diversifying in their
crop choices (such as by growing the newly-profitable rubber trees) (Lim, 1977; Drabble,

5

2000). 8 The British fostered Chinese immigrants, especially for the booming mining sector,
while they brought in workers from the Indian subcontinent for the new cash-crop plantations
(sugarcane, coffee and especially rubber). 9 When tradeoffs emerged between the interests of the
(mainly Malay) smallholders and the plantations, the latter tended to be favored. 10
Some Malays needed to be educated for the Colonial civil service, especially to facilitate
interactions with the local Sultans. However, the bulk of the Bumiputera lacked easy access to
modern schooling, if only because schools were scarce in the rural areas where most Bumiputera
lived. 11 While average schooling attainments were improving generally in the late colonial
period, the education system of the time probably left the majority of the Bumiputera poorly
equipped in the skills (including in the English language) needed for participation in the
emerging non-farm economy.
Thus, Malaysia at the time of Independence was highly dualistic, comprising a large,
low-productivity, traditional farming sector with foreign-controlled export-oriented mining and
plantation sectors. There was a corresponding ethnic polarization in employment with the bulk of
the Malays in the subsistence farming sector, non-Malays in the rest.
The only survey-based quantification of the extent of ethnic inequality at the time of
Independence comes from the 1957/58 Household Budget Survey. The reliability and
comparability (over time and space) of that survey are questionable (Anand, 1983). But this is all
we have. Based on that survey, Urban Chinese mean income was 2.8 times the rural Malay mean
in 1957 (Ikemoto, 1985). There was far higher poverty incidence among Malays; Ikemoto (1985)
estimates a poverty rate of 71% for Malays in 1957 as compared to 27% for those with Chinese
origin and 36% for those with Indian origin. 12
Prior to Independence, the profits from Malaysia’s primary exports, notably tin and
rubber, were in large part remitted to Britain, and domestic consumption saw little growth. 13 This
For example, the Colonial administrators imposed restrictions on the use and sale of Malay people’s agricultural
land to non-Malays (as described by Lim, 1977). This was rationalized as an effort to protect the Malays.

The social stratification of colonial Malaya is described in Hirschman (1975), Anand (1983), Ikemoto (1985),

By 1957 the vast majority of the Chinese and Indian people in Malaya had been born there; see Hirschman (1972).
13
The British colony of Malaya (as present-day West, or “Peninsular,” Malaysia was called then) had seen sizeable
growth of GDP over 1900-1939, at about 3% per annum (Shah, 2017). However, only a modest share of this output
growth was passed onto domestic real wages, consumption or domestic invesment. The historical data suggest that
domestic private consumption per capita grew at only 1% per annum over 1900-1939 (Shah, 2017).
8

changed with Independence, such that domestic consumption growth started to match GDP
growth, and the economy became more diversified. It is likely that poverty incidence started to
fall post-Independence, though no comparable national survey data exist to test this claim with
tolerable rigor until 1970. However, it appears unlikely that inequality between Malays and
Chinese had fallen in the decade or so after Independence. Ikemoto (1985) provides estimates
(for Peninsular Malaysia) indicating that urban Chinese mean income was a remarkable 3.1 times
the rural Malay mean in 1970, as compared to 2.8 times in 1957/58. 14 Again, the comparability
of results between the 1957/58 survey and that for 1970 is questionable, and the numbers should
only be taken to be broadly indicative.
The post-Independence period saw a rapid expansion in school enrollments. In 1955, just
before Independence, 42% of the relevant age groups were not enrolled in primary or secondary
school, but this had fallen to only 9% by the early 1970s (Drabble, 2000, p.283). However, while
this expansion in schooling would eventually help reduce income poverty, the implication for
inequality is unclear; when the schooling gaps between the rich and poor are large (as they
undoubtedly were at the time of Malaysia’s Independence), a generalized expansion in schooling
can be expected to increase earnings inequality (Ravallion, 2016, Section 7.5).
In short, while the colonial period generated ethnic inequality, policy makers in the
immediate post-Independence period appear to have given too little attention to that inequality,
and the consensus in the literature is that ethnic inequality rose in the decade or so after
Independence. 15 This neglect of ethnic inequality in the near term was to have a high cost. The
Sino-Malay race riots that broke out in Kuala Lumpur in May 1969 are widely seen to have been
motivated by the lack of attention to the prevailing ethnic inequalities in the country. 16
The policy response was the New Economic Policy (NEP). The twin aims were (i) to help
the Bumiputera catch up economically with other Malaysians, esp., the Chinese, and (ii) to
reduce absolute poverty, with a goal of bringing the poverty rate down from 49% to 17% in 1990
(Jomo and Wee, 2014). Greatly expanded affirmative action policies favored the Bumiputera,
such as by aiming to assure that they owned at least 30% of corporate wealth by 1990 (with

ethnic restrictions on share ownership in public companies to help assure this). Preferences were
given to the Bumiputera in access to public education through quotas and university
scholarships. Some of the ostensibly “color-blind” policies would also have favored the
Bumiputera such as the emphasis given to raising the productivity of smallholder agriculture.
The NEP officially ended in 1991. By the mid-1980s, the leadership was de-emphasizing
inequality, in favor of greater emphasis on economic growth (Yusof and Bhattasali, 2008; Jomo
and Wee, 2014). However, the ethnic-inequality focus of the NEP did not vanish in 1991, but has
had a continuing influence on policy, and stimulated continuing debate, up to the present time.
There is evidence that ethnic inequality in schooling fell in the wake of the NEP. The
school enrollment rates of the Malays had lagged other ethnic groups but soon caught up, or even
overtook them (Pong, 1993). 17 Given the initial inequality in education among the Malays, it can
be expected that this process would also have been inequality-reducing within that ethnic group,
which is also borne out by the findings of Pong (1993). However, test scores in math and science
indicate persistent inequalities by ethnicity and (especially) socio-economic status within ethnic
groups (Mohammadpour, 2012; Saw, 2015).
Soon after the 1969 riots, the Government of Malaysia started reporting regularly on
income poverty and inequality. The official statistics on income inequality from the Economic
Planning Unit (EPU) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, based on household survey data
collected by the Government’s Department of Statistics (DOSM), use the standard Gini index of
household incomes. Their estimates indicate a trend decline in income inequality starting from
the mid-1970s.
The discussion will return to study these data more closely, but one point is notable now:
given the historical importance of ethnicity it is surprising that neither the official statistics nor
the academic literature appear to include any summary statistics for the evolution of ethnic
inequality over time. Indeed, one does not find any actual measures of ethnic inequality over
time, which can be defined as the inequality between ethnic groups, taken account of their size,
but ignoring the inequality within groups. The next section will provide such measures.

Using survey data for Peninsular Malaysia, Pong (1993) finds that secondary schooling attainments of older
cohorts of Malays lagged other groups, but this had switched for the younger cohort. She interprets this as an effect
of the NEP’s preferential schooling policies.
17

8

Other observers have expressed surprise at this finding of falling inequality, and pointed
to contrary evidence (such as using wealth rather than income) (Lee and Khalid, 2018). But even
focusing on household incomes, there are a number of reasons for caution. The literature has
provided evidence of a continuing “pro-Chinese” bias in the labor market, as reflected in
earnings regressions (including controls for education, experience and location) (Milanovic,
2006). 18 A randomized experiment by Lee and Khalid (2016) also demonstrated such a bias in
employer responses to job applications that differ only in ethnicity, as suggested by the
applicant’s name. There may be substantial horizontal inequality hidden by standard measures.
Another reason for questioning the claimed progress in reducing household income
inequality is the fact that the EPU/DOSM numbers relate (as is common) to relative inequality,
while perceptions of “inequality” appear often to reflect absolute inequality. 19 The next section
will also look at what has been happening to absolute inequality in Malaysia.
Even though poverty was far more prevalent among the Bumiputera, it does not follow
that success in reducing ethnic inequality helped much in reducing poverty nationally. A
common view is that growth in the mean income of the Bumiputera favored the relatively welloff in that group, largely bypassing the poor. With reference to the NEP, the first Prime Minister
of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, was opposed to the 30% target for Bumiputera share
ownership, writing that “Some (Malays) became rich overnight while others became despicable
Ali Babas and the country suffered economic setbacks” (Abdul Rahman, 1986, p.98). Similarly,
Jomo (1989, p.42) describes the new State interventionism of the 1970s, under the NEP, as being
“..primarily in favour of the nascent Malay bourgeoisie;” he conspicuously does not say “in favor
of poor Malays.” He goes on to argue that: “..poverty…could have been completely eradicated if
more just and effective redistributive policies had been implemented, government waste
minimised, and if government allocations ostensibly for poverty eradication had not been used to
enrich politicians and contractors securing rural projects” (Jomo, 1989, p.46).
The claim here is that, while progress toward the NEP targets would undoubtedly
increase mean income of the Bumiputera, it only benefited a select few with initial advantages,
or luck. The dominant view in the literature is that, beyond creating a new class of Malay rentiers
thriving on political and government patronage, the bulk of the Malays saw little gain. Motivated

9

in large part by this view in the historical record, a number of observers have argued that the
race-grounded redistributive policies need to be replaced with “needs-based affirmative action”
(Thillainathan and Cheong, 2018, p.302; Economist, 2017). By this view, such policies are no
longer needed, given past progress against both ethnic inequality and poverty.
There are strong feelings on both sides of this (ongoing) debate. The rest of the paper
draws on the available data to try to see what more can be learnt about the extent of progress
against ethnic inequality and how much that progress helped against poverty since 1969. The
analysis will challenge some aspects of the prevailing historical narrative summarized above.

Inequality and poverty in Malaysia, 1970-2016
The bulk of the data used here originate from a series of 18 nationally-representative

household surveys spanning 1970-2016. 20 A constraint on the analysis is the lack of public
access to the micro data. Machine-readable micro data only exist since 1997 (based on
interviews with DOSM staff), and even these recent micro data are not publically available. 21
Political sensitivity to ethnic issues is a likely reason for the lack of public access to these
(public) data. Thankfully, tabulations of summary statistics are available back to 1970, although
these are rather limited in their detail and I cannot check the calculations in these tables. These
data limitations naturally constrain the analysis of this paper in some respects, as described
below.
Ethnicity: A large number of ethnic groups are identified in Malaysia, especially East
Malaysia (with 40 “sub-ethnic groups” found in Sarawak alone). Here the focus is on the
country’s three main ethnic groups, the Bumiputera, the Malaysian-Chinese and the MalaysianIndians, together comprising 99% of the population (averaged over all survey years since 1969).
The largest group of Bumiputera are the “Malay” people, defined in the Constitution as “a person
who professed the Muslim religion, habitually speaks the Malay language, and conforms to the
Malay custom.” 22 “Chinese” are relatively well defined as those of Chinese descent (whatever

There were two prior surveys but there are serious comparability problems with the 1970 survey (Anand, 1983).
Researchers can make application to DOSM for selected variables from sub-samples from the most recent
surveys, to address specific research questions.

Other Bumiputera include the Orang Asli, the original inhabitants of Peninsular Malaysia, now representing 0.5%
of the population.

their country of birth). “Indians” include people descending from immigrants from Bangladesh,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka as well as those with actual Indian (mainly Tamil) descent. 23
Figure 1 shows the ethnic population shares over time. From the 2010 Census, the
Bumiputera are 68% of the total (55% Malay and 13% other Bumiputera), the Chinese are 25%
and Indians 7%. While this paper takes a national perspective, it should be noted that there are
some marked geographic differences in ethnic composition.24 In West Malaysia, the Bumiputera
are mainly Malay people as distinct from East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) where a larger
share are non-Malay. The rising share of Bumiputera over time reflects ethnic differences in the
fertility rate but also conversions to Islam. 25 The rising share of the poorest ethnic group will
tend to be poverty increasing. We will see how much so in Section 4.
Distributional data: The analysis uses two main sources: (i) the published tabulations by
EPU/DOSM available from 1970 onwards and (ii) the World Bank’s PovcalNet database from
1984. The underlying database for PovcalNet comprises both tabulations and (for recent years)
micro data on household income, household size and the survey weights, drawn from the DOSM
surveys. Following international practice, the DOSM definition of “income” includes both cash
income and imputed values for goods received as income-in-kind (such as from household farms
and enterprises). There are four main differences between (i) and (ii). First, the PovcalNet series
misses two-thirds of the NEP period. Second, the EPU poverty measures allow for regional
differences in the cost-of-living which PovcalNet does not. Third, PovcalNet uses the national
CPI while the official measures use an implicit deflator anchored to consumption in a
neighborhood of the poverty line. Finally, the EPU published tables use household total income
while PovcalNet uses household income per capita (as is more common practice internationally).
A useful descriptive tool for representing the overall changes in income distribution is the
Growth Incidence Curve (GIC) (Ravallion and Chen, 2003). This gives the growth rate over time
by (anonymous) percentiles of the distribution, ranked from poorest to richest. The GIC is
obtained by using dated quantile functions to calculate growth rates by percentile (as explained
The 1970 and 1980 censuses provide these breakdowns for the total population, although later Censuses switched
to total citizens.
24
From the 2010 Census, the percentage Malay varies from 43% in Penang (Kuala Lumpur close behind with 45%)
to 97% in Terengganu (95% in Kelantan). The percentage Chinese ranges from 3% in Kelantan and Terengganu to
46% in Penang (43% in Kuala Lumpur).
25
In 1991, the Bumiputera fertility rate was 4.5, as compared to 2.5 for the Chinese and 2.8 for Indians (Saw, 2015).
By 2011 all three fertility rates had fallen, but the proportionate differences remained similar; in 2011 the fertility
rates were 2.7, 1.6 and 1.7 respectively.
23

11

in Ravallion and Chen, 2003). Unfortunately, the GIC cannot be calculated from the published
tabulations by EPU/DOSM. Nevertheless, it can be calculated using PovcalNet by numerical
methods (inverting the process by using a line search to find the “poverty line” corresponding to
each possible “headcount index” as one moves from the poorest percentile to the richest). The
base year for the GIC is 1984, the earliest year of the data for Malaysia in PovcalNet.
The resulting GIC in Figure 2 indicates that the incidence of growth has tended to favor
poorer fractiles. The growth rate in mean household income per capita varied from the highest
value of 3.4% at percentiles 5-6, to the lowest value at the very top. Given that all quantiles saw
positive growth, the poverty rate has fallen for all possible poverty lines. Given that growth rates
tend to be higher for poorer percentiles, it can be said that “inequality” has fallen. Unfortunately,
the GIC cannot be broken down by ethnicity since this is not available in PovcalNet, and reliable
GICs cannot be calculated from the limited published tabulations available historically.
The series of inequality measures from EPU/DOSM go back further, to 1970. Recall that
EPU/DOSM use household income as the ranking variable (not per capita, as in PovcalNet). For
the common years, the EPU/DOSM Gini index is lower than from PovcalNet; the mean
difference in the Gini index is 1.5% (44.4% versus 45.9%). Figure 3a plots the EPU/DOSM Gini
index over the whole period. The index rose for the first few years, but then a downward trend
began. The index fell from 51.3% to 39.9% over 1970-2016. Using all years, the trend rate of
decline (the regression coefficient on time) was -0.25% points per year (s.e.=0.03%). 26 Using
instead the per-capita Gini indices from PovcalNet over 1984-2016, the trend rate of decline was
-0.20% points per year (s.e.=0.06%). This can be compared with the Gini indices found in the
data set for the longest available spells between household surveys for 144 countries described in
Ravallion and Chen (2018). (The median year of the earliest survey is 1993, and that for the
latest is 2012.) The mean rate of change in the Gini index in that data set is -0.06% points per
year, and it is not significantly different from zero (s.e.=0.04). So Malaysia’s success in reducing
inequality is far from typical.
EPU/DOSM reports the (standard) Gini indices in which absolute gaps are normalized by
the current mean. This gives a relative inequality measure, as distinct from an absolute measure,

All standard errors reported in this paper are robust to residual autocorrelation as well as heteroscedasticity, using
the method Newey and West (1987) (the automatic lag specification with the degrees of freedom adjustment).

which reflects the absolute gaps between “rich” and “poor.” 27 The choice of measure depends on
which of two rival axioms one prefers. 28 There is no “right” or “wrong” answer, so it can be
deceptive to look at only one of the two. Figure 3b gives the absolute Gini index—half the mean
real income gap between all pairs of households. We see a marked rise in absolute inequality,
reflecting both the rise in average income and limited reduction in relative inequality.
Figure 4a gives the relative Gini indices by ethnic group. Relative inequality has been
falling within each group, and nationally since the mid-1970s—precisely when the NEP took are
more aggressive stance against inequality. The evidence does not support the view that economic
growth has been (relative) inequality increasing within any ethnic group. Indeed, for each group,
one finds a negative correlation between levels of the Gini index and the means; the correlation
coefficients between the (log) Gini index and (log) mean real income are -0.83, -0.72, and -0.60
for the Bumiputera, Chinese and Indians respectively. However, the correlations drop
substantially when one switches to the difference-in-logs, suggesting that the correlation in the
levels is generated by common time trends. The correlation coefficient between changes in the
(log) Bumiputera Gini index and the log Bumiputera mean is 0.25, but this is not significantly
different from zero (t=0.99). For the Chinese, the correlation is 0.03 while it is 0.15 for Indians;
neither is significantly different from zero.
The absolute Gini indices by ethnicity are in Figure 4b. Absolute inequality has been
rising for all three groups, but more steeply so among the Malaysian-Chinese.
Growth rates by ethnicity: Over time, all three main ethnic groups have seen rising mean
incomes, with the Bumiputera having the highest growth rate (Figure 5a). The annual growth
rates (based on a regression of log mean on time) over 1970-2016 were 4.15% (s.e.=0.19%), 3.09
(0.18), and 3.31 (0.13) for the Bumiputera, Chinese and Indians respectively. Thus, there was
progress toward relative convergence, with the Bumiputera mean rising as a proportion of both
the Chinese mean and the Indian mean (Figure 5b). The 1990s was an exception.
On the other hand, absolute incomes have diverged over time (Figure 5c). Each series of
absolute gaps relative to the Chinese in Figure 5c has shown a significant positive trend (at better
On this conceptual distinction see Ravallion (2018). The distinction has salience in Malaysia; see, for example,
the media report in the Star entitled “Malaysia’s widening income gap between rich and poor.” This makes the
distinction between absolute and relative inequality, drawing on a report by KRI (2018).
28
The relative measure stems from the scale-invariance axiom (multiplying all incomes by a constant leaves the
measure unchanged), while the absolute measure stems from translation invariance (adding a constant leaves it
unchanged). For an overview of these axioms and the measures implied see Cowell (2000).

than the 1% level), although this is not true of the Indian-Bumiputera gap (which has a positive
trend, but only significant at the 6% level).
Clearly, Figure 5c does not support the claim that “The gap in income between Malays …
and Chinese- and Indian-Malaysians has narrowed dramatically” (Economist, 2017). Indeed, one
might be more inclined to say that the (absolute) gap has risen dramatically. The rising absolute
ethnic disparities reflect the extent of the initial ethnic inequality, as well as the pattern of growth
by ethnicity. (More precisely, if the mean for group i grows at a constant rate 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 , such that 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =

(1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 )𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 , then it is readily verified that (on comparing groups i and j), 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 < (>

around 1970, mean income of the Bumiputera would have had to grow at 2.3 times the Chinese
rate, while in actuality the subsequent ratio of growth rates was 1.3.
It is of interest to see if the path of growth rates by ethnicity was any different during the
NEP period. While the NEP continued to have influence after 1991, if the NEP was an important
factor in reducing ethnic inequality then we would expect to see signs of this in the data. Here it
is notable that, while overall inequality has been on a trend decline in Malaysia, this did not start
until the mid-1970s. An obvious test is to see whether the evolution of the group-specific mean
relative to the overall mean changed in the NEP period. On pooling the three ethnic groups, the
test regression can be written as:
𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 /𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 = ∑3𝑖𝑖=1[𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 + (𝛽𝛽0𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑖𝑖 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 )(𝑡𝑡 − 1)]𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

(1)

where 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 denotes the mean income of group j (=1,2,3) in year t (=1,T) with national mean, 𝜇𝜇𝑡𝑡 ,

𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 = 1 if t is within the NEP period and 0 otherwise, and 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1 if i=j and 0 otherwise. In

other words, each group has its own initial (1970) ratio of mean income to the overall mean, and
the ratio evolves with a trend rate specific to each group, but with a different NEP trend. Using
the pooled data set of survey years and three ethnic groups (n=54), I find that 𝛽𝛽̂11 = 0.003

(robust s.e.=0.0005) (for the Bumiputera), 𝛽𝛽̂12 = −0.003 (0.001) (for the Chinese) and 𝛽𝛽̂13 =

−0.004 (0.001) (for the Indians). The ratio of the Bumiputera mean to the national mean would

have been 0.06 lower without the NEP, representing a drop from 0.81 to 0.75 by 1991.

So the NEP period saw a significantly higher trend increase in the relative mean of the

Bumiputera, with significantly lower trends for those with Chinese and Indian origin. While

warning against causal attribution, these findings are at least consistent with the view that the
NEP encouraged convergence in in relative income by ethnicity.
There is no sign that the NEP period came at a cost to the overall rate of growth. The
mean growth rate of household income was 3.9% in the NEP period versus 3.8% in the rest (with
standard errors of 1.9% and 1.4%). However, while such comparisons are suggestive, they
cannot be conclusive as to whether the NEP came at a cost to growth (or stimulated it).
Measures of ethnic inequality: The official statistics and academic literature are (oddly)
devoid of defensible ethnic-inequality measures over time. One sees many instances in the
literature of the types of comparisons of group means in the last sub-section. Yet most people
would surely agree that individuals should be weighted equally when measuring inequality.
Looking solely at group means does not, of course, do that.
To measure ethnic inequality one can follow the literature on inequality decomposition
and set all incomes within a given group to that group’s mean, and then measure inequality for
this synthetic distribution. More formally, let 𝑦𝑦ℎ𝑗𝑗 denote the income for household h=1,..,𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗 in

group j=1,2,3 (in this case) with mean 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 . The actual distribution is

𝒚𝒚 ≡ �𝑦𝑦11 , 𝑦𝑦21 , … , 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛1 1 ; 𝑦𝑦12 , 𝑦𝑦22 , … , 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛2 2 ; 𝑦𝑦11 , 𝑦𝑦23 , … , 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛3 3 �

and the overall inequality index is 𝐼𝐼(𝒚𝒚) for a suitable function I. The measure of ethnic inequality
is then 𝐼𝐼(𝒚𝒚∗ ), based on the synthetic distribution:

𝒚𝒚∗ ≡ (𝜇𝜇1 , 𝜇𝜇1 , … , 𝜇𝜇1 ; 𝜇𝜇2 , 𝜇𝜇2 , … , 𝜇𝜇2 ; 𝜇𝜇3 , 𝜇𝜇3 , … , 𝜇𝜇3 ).

The key property of 𝐼𝐼(𝒚𝒚∗ ) is that the inequality is only between groups of individuals. Naturally,
this measure takes account of the differing sizes of the groups. 29 Two standard functional forms

for 𝐼𝐼(𝒚𝒚∗ ) are considered here, namely:
1

𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺 (𝒚𝒚∗ ) = 2𝜇𝜇 ∑3𝑖𝑖=1 ∑3𝑗𝑗=1 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗 �𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 − 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 �
𝐼𝐼𝑀𝑀 (𝒚𝒚∗ ) = ln(𝜇𝜇) − ∑3𝑖𝑖=1 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 ln(𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 )

(2.1)
(2.2)

where 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 is the population share of group i and the overall mean is 𝜇𝜇(= ∑3𝑖𝑖=1 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 ). 𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺 (𝒚𝒚∗ ) can be

recognized as the between-group Gini index while 𝐼𝐼𝑀𝑀 (𝒚𝒚∗ ) is that for the Mean-Log Deviation

(MLD). Both satisfy the usual transfer axiom, which says that a mean-preserving redistribution
from group j and group i with 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 > 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 must reduce ethnic inequality. 𝐼𝐼𝑀𝑀 (𝒚𝒚∗ ) (but not 𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺 (𝒚𝒚∗ ))

Some measures use income shares as weights (see, for example, Bourguignon, 1979). Here I take the view that
individuals should be weighted equally when thinking about inequality, whatever the individual incomes.

also satisfies the Monotonicity in Distance axiom of Cowell and Flachaire (2017), i.e., when
comparing two distributions that differ in one person’s income, the greater the distance from
equality, the higher the inequality. Also, MLD is exactly decomposable into between and within
group components (Bourguignon, 1979). However, while we can always calculate a Gini index
for the synthetic distribution 𝒚𝒚∗ , as in (2.1), the difference between that index and the

corresponding 𝐼𝐼(𝒚𝒚) does not only reflect inequality within groups. As is well known, there is

also a component that stems from the overlaps in ethnic distributions, reflecting the interaction of
the between- and within-group components. 30 This only goes to zero when ethnic distributions
do not overlap.
Figure 6a gives the summary statistics of relative ethnic inequality over time for both
measures. 31 We see a marked downward trend in relative ethnic inequality, though uneven;
ethnic inequality rose over the period 1994-2002. The inter-ethnic Gini index has fallen
substantially, from 20.0% to 6.9%. Both measures indicate that ethnic inequality rose
immediately after the NEP’s official end date, 1991. Figure 6b gives the absolute Gini index of
ethnic inequality. (There is no absolute version of MLD.) This shows a trend increase over time,
from 20.0 in 1970 to 36.6 in 2016 and the regression-based trend of 0.003 per year is significant
at the 1% level (s.e.=0.001). The absolute Gini for ethnic inequality fluctuated over time, but
showed little increase in the NEP period.
The complete decomposition of the (relative) Gini index over time is found in Figure 7.
While total inequality and its ethnic between-group component (𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺 (𝒚𝒚∗ )) have fallen, the within-

group and overlap components have remained fairly stable; indeed, neither shows a statistically
significant trend at the 5% level, although the positive trend in the overlap component passes at
the 7% level. Even though the Gini index has declined within each of the three groups (Figure

4a), the contributions to total within-group inequality are weighted by the products of population
and income shares, which do not sum to unity. 32 Furthermore, the total weight has a strong
positive trend, rising from 0.39 to 0.50 over 1970-2016. Given that the within-group Gini indices
are similar (Figure 4a), this renders the overall within-group component close to stationary.

Lambert and Aronson (1993) provide a good explanation of this overlap component.
Recall that EPU/DOSM uses household incomes, not per capita. There is not option but to weight households
equally, ignoring differences in household size.
𝑦𝑦
𝑦𝑦
32
The total within-group component of the Gini index is ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 where 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 is the income share of group i and 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 is
∗
the Gini index. Note that 𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺 (𝒚𝒚 ) now includes all other ethnic groups, though this makes negligible difference.
30

Thus, it can be said that the falling overall Gini index is attributable to the country’s success in
reducing ethnic inequality.
Poverty measures: The official measures apply the Government’s poverty lines to
DOSM’s surveys on household incomes. The nominal line is re-calculated for each survey, but
only updated for price-level changes. So these are absolute measures.
Based on the official figures, Malaysia is close to eliminating poverty, and this is so for
each of the three main ethnic groups. Figure 8a gives the national poverty measures. At the
beginning of the period, the overall poverty rate was 49%, falling to 0.4% by 2016. The
compound growth rate in the poverty index is an impressive -9.9% per annum. 33 The NEP’s
target of bringing the official poverty rate down to 17% by 1990 was achieved.
How does this progress against poverty compare to other countries? For that purpose, we
can use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates from the International Comparison
Program (ICP). The national average official line in 2009 was MYR 800 per household per
month (EPU, 2010), or MYR 840 in 2011 prices, which is the year of the last ICP. Average
household size was 4.3 persons in 2010. Thus, the average official line is equivalent to MYR 6.4
per person per day at average household size. When converted using the PPP for consumption
from the 2011 ICP, the official line comes out to almost exactly $4 per day. 34 From PovcalNet
one can calculate annualized rates of change in the poverty rate for a $4 a day line over 19812015. Using a regression of log H on year, for Malaysia the rate is -8.5% per annum (s.e.=1.8%).
This is well above (in absolute value) the rate for the world as a whole, which is -1.8%
(s.e.=0.4%). It is also more than double the rate for East Asia as a whole, which is -4.1% (0.7%).
Malaysia is clearly one of the world’s star performers in terms of the annual rate of poverty
reduction over this period, as judged by Malaysia’s official poverty line. 35
Turning to the ethnic poverty profile, one finds that the Bumiputera poverty rate fell from
65% to 0.5% (Figure 8a). For the Chinese and Indians, the poverty rate was 26% and 39% at the
beginning of the period, falling to 0.1% by 2016. All three groups have seen large declines in the
incidence of poverty, but the share accountable to the Bumiputera has risen (Figure 8b).
33
This is calculated using only the end points of the series. If instead one regresses the log of the headcount index on
time using the whole series then the implied growth rate is -9.44% (s.e.=0.81%; n=17).
34
The PPP rate for private consumption from the 2011 ICP is 1.59 per $1. This is well below the exchange rate,
since, PPP rates are based on the actual prices paid by Malaysians, including for goods not trade internationally.
35
Neighboring Thailand did slightly better, with a rate of -9.9% per annum (s.e.=1.4%). China and Vietnam both
had a rate of -5.0% per annum (s.e.=1.0% and 1.1% respectively). Indonesia had a rate of -2.0% (0.3%).

17

Averaged over the 2000s, the Bumiputera accounted for two-thirds (67%) of the population but
94% of those designated as poor. While this paper takes a national perspective, it is notable that
the location of the country’s poor has also shifted over time between West and East Malaysia. In
1976, 29% of the poor lived in Sabah and Sarawak, but by 2012 this had risen to 64%. 36
Some observers have questioned whether Malaysia’s longstanding official poverty line
(going back to 1970) is still socially relevant today. 37 There are survey-based methods of
addressing that question, so as to derive the Social Subjective Poverty Line (Ravallion, 2016)—
defined as the income level above which people tend to say they are not poor, but below which
they say they are poor. Absent such survey data for Malaysia, one clue is to see how the official
line compares to other countries. $4 a day is well above the World Bank’s international poverty
line of $1.90 a day. But it should be well above that line. The $1.90 line is deliberately low,
being anchored to poverty lines found in the poorest countries. If one looks instead at countries
with a roughly similar average income as Malaysia, one would expect the poverty line to be
about $12 a day—three times the current line in Malaysia. 38 Figure 9 shows how Malaysia’s
poverty line compares to the poverty lines found in other countries. Malaysia’s current official
line is clearly well below what one would expect for a country with its current average standard
of living. $4 a day may well have been a sensible line for Malaysia in 1970. That is no longer
clear; real income per household in Malaysia has increased more than fivefold over 1970-2016!
As an alternative, I have constructed relative lines that rise with average income in a
seemingly sensible way. The slope is 1:3. The intercept is set at $2.50, the official “hard-core”
poverty line (given by the food component of the official line). These parameter choices yield a
poverty line of about $12 per day in 2016. This is a schedule of “weakly relative lines” as
defined by Ravallion and Chen (2011). The word “weakly” refers to the fact that the poverty line
is not directly proportional to the mean (so that it has an elasticity less than unity). Making the

I have used the population counts from the 1970 and 2010 Censuses. Official poverty rates for Sabah and Sarawak
are not available before 1976.
37
For example, in one comment in 2018 in the Malaysian newspaper, the Star, the Deputy Minister of International
Trade and Investment, Dr Ong Kian Ming, wrote that “As wages climbed and we became a middle-income nation,
we didn’t increase the standard for what is considered decent living above the poverty line.”
38
Taking the arithmetic mean of the last three years, mean income is $24.84 in 2015. Using a linear regression of
national poverty lines on the means for non-OECD countries, the predicted poverty line is $11.94 (s.e.=$0.34).
36

line directly proportional to the mean (“strongly relative”) has the odd property that if all
incomes (including that of the poor) rise by the same percentage then poverty does not change. 39
Figure 10 compares my new series of poverty measures for Malaysia with those for $4 a
day. Here the only option is to use PovcalNet, so the series starts in 1984. The pattern is similar
over time, and we still see a marked longer-term decline in poverty incidence. However, the new
series suggests that Malaysia still has a long way go to eliminating poverty.

4.

A decomposition analysis of Malaysia’s progress against poverty
The poverty rate depends on both mean income and the relative distribution of income,

loosely interpretable as “inequality.” Using PovcalNet one can calculate counterfactual
measures, which combine the mean for one date with the distribution (Lorenz curve) for another
date. Table 1 gives these measures using both the initial (1984) and end point (2016) for the
series in PovcalNet. Applying the Datt and Ravallion (1992) decomposition one finds that 75%
of the reduction in absolute poverty in Malaysia since 1984 is attributable to growth in mean
household income, with 25% due to falling inequality. 40 (Recall that the NEP started in 1971; the
share attributable to inequality may well be higher if the PovcalNet series had also started in
1970.) This changes noticeably if one switches to the (weakly) relative measures described in the
previous section. Then the same decomposition method, but now using the relative lines,
indicates that 43% of the fall in poverty over the same period was attributable to falling
inequality (a pro-poor shift in distribution at a given mean), with 57% due to growth in the mean,
holding the Lorenz curve constant (Table 1).
Given the aforementioned data constraints, it is not possible to do such decompositions
back to 1970 or by ethnicity. However, from the published historical tabulations it is possible to
identify the effect of changes in ethnic inequality on the evolution over time of the official
(absolute) poverty measures. That is the focus of the rest of this section.

Strongly relative lines also have the property that the poverty rate can fall in a recession. For example, if one uses
strongly relative lines for Malaysia I find that the poverty rate fell during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-10.
That is clearly questionable. Weakly relative lines are more sensible.
40
The 1984 Lorenz curve is held constant, while the mean grows at the observed rate. This is equivalent to reestimating the 1984 poverty measure using the original poverty line times the ratio of the end-point mean to the
1984 mean. I have taken an average of the decompositions using the initial and final years as the references. As
noted by Datt and Ravallion (1992) the decomposition becomes exact when one does this averaging.
39

19

First, this section provides an analytic decomposition of the rate of national poverty
reduction that identifies ethnic redistribution as an explicit component. On implementing the
decomposition empirically, it is then shown that ethnic redistribution has helped reduce poverty
nationally though it has been a less important factor than within-group redistribution and
(especially) overall economic growth. The last subsection asks whether this is because ethnic
redistribution is a blunt instrument.
Measuring the contribution of ethnic redistribution: One way of measuring the impact
of lower ethnic inequality on poverty is to calculate counterfactual poverty measures by
ethnicity, as obtained by replacing each group-specific mean by the overall mean (similarly to
my measure of ethnic inequality). Thus, the ethnic dimension of inequality is artificially
removed, while preserving within-group distributions. The difference between the populationweighted aggregate of these counterfactual poverty measures and the actual national measure is
then taken to indicate the contribution of ethnic inequality to national poverty. As a consequence
of the aforementioned data limitations (notably the absence of suitable tabulations from the 1970
survey data), it is not possible to perform these counterfactual calculations. But nor is it obvious
that this is the best way to proceed. As noted, reducing ethnic inequality (the dispersion in means
by ethnicity) could well alter inequality within ethnic groups.
Instead, this section proposes a feasible analytic decomposition, exploiting the variation
over time, while allowing changes in the group-specific means to alter distribution within
groups. The new decomposition gives the proportionate rate of progress against poverty as the
sum of: (i) a pure growth component; (ii) an ethnic inequality component allowing within-group
inequality to change; (iii) a component reflecting intra-ethnic distributional shifts not
accountable to growth in the group-specific means, and (iv) a population composition component
reflecting ethnic differences in population growth rates. The next subsection provides a more
formal exposition.
As with other such decompositions, the components are treated as independent. In this
respect, probably the main caveat is that the NEP may have reduced Malaysia’s rate of economic
growth (Thillainathan and Cheong, 2016), which one would expect to be poverty reducing, based
on evidence from other countries. 41 Possibly the loss of growth dominated the gains from ethnic
redistribution. However, the evidence for the claim that the policy reduced the growth rate is not

For an overview of that evidence see Ravallion (2016, Chapter 8).

20

strong; as we have seen, the mean growth rate was no lower in the NEP period, though we do not
know the counterfactual. The claim that the NEP came at a cost to growth must be considered
something of a conjecture. If it is true that the NEP diminished the growth rate then the
decomposition used in this paper will overstate the contribution of lower ethnic inequality to
poverty reduction.
The decomposition in theory: Some well-known properties of the Lorenz curve
(following Gastwirth, 1971) are used here to develop the required decomposition. A brief review
of those properties will be useful. Let 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝) denote the (differentiable) Lorenz curve for group i

(=1,..,4), giving the share of the group’s total income held by the poorest p proportion of the

population ranked by income, y. As is well known, 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 ′(𝑝𝑝) = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 /𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 , where 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 is the group’s mean
income. Equivalently (on inverting), 𝑝𝑝 = 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ) where 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 is the group-specific cumulative

distribution function (subsuming the mean) with corresponding density function 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 (= 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖′ (. )).

Letting 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 denote the headcount index (“poverty rate”) we have 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 ′(𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑧𝑧, the poverty line
(taken to be fixed across groups), i.e., 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 = 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 (𝑧𝑧).

Without loss of generality, we can assume that a parameter vector 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 fully characterizes

the inter-group differences, so we can re-write the Lorenz curve as 𝐿𝐿(𝑝𝑝, 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 ). Motivated by the

discussion in earlier sections, the Lorenz parameters can be altered by the growth process,

reflecting the potentially unequal ways in which efforts to reduce inter-group inequality may
alter within-group inequality. We can write this as 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 = 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖 (𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 where 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 is a vector of
group-specific parameters that are unaffected by changes in the mean.

Combining these features, the poverty rate 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 for group i satisfies:
𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿𝑝𝑝 (𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 , 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖 (𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑧𝑧

𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 = −𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋 (. )𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 (𝑧𝑧)/𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖

21

Here 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 is the elasticity of the poverty rate for group i to the mean for group i, allowing

“inequality” (as reflected in the 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 parameters) to change with growth in the mean. 42 The second

term on the RHS of (5) stems from shifts in intra-group inequality not attributable to growth in

the mean. In the special case in which the Lorenz curve parameters are fixed (𝑑𝑑𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 = 0) we have
𝑑𝑑𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 =0 and 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 = −𝑧𝑧𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 (𝑧𝑧)/𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 , the elasticity of the headcount index evaluated at the poverty line

(as expected, given that 𝐻𝐻 is homogeneous of degree zero in 𝜇𝜇 ad z).

On noting that 𝐻𝐻 = ∑4𝑖𝑖=1 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 (where 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 ≡ 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 /𝑛𝑛) it is readily verified that:

Here 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝐻𝐻 ≡ 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 /𝐻𝐻, the share of poverty in group i. Notice that a term in the changes in

population shares now appears, in addition to the effects of growth and distributional changes.
With some further algebraic manipulation, we then have the following decomposition of the
proportionate rate of poverty reduction:

If all ethnic groups see the same rate of growth in mean income then the ethnic redistribution
component goes to zero. If, in addition, there are no changes in inequality within group
(specifically in the Lorenz parameters), and all groups have the same rate of population growth,
then only the overall rate of growth matters to the rate of poverty reduction.
Empirical implementation: Table 2 provides the relevant summary statistics for
implementing the decomposition in equation (6). We also need the unconditional growth
elasticities of poverty reduction—the 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 ’s in (6). Table 3 gives regression estimates of those
elasticities, both nationally (panel a) and by ethnic group (panel b)—the latter being the

estimates of the 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 ’s. Results are provided for both the (log) levels and the first difference in

logs, given that the variables have strong time trends in the levels. Thus, this second specification
is likely to be more robust to time-dependent omitted variables.

These elasticities should not be confused with Kakwani’s (1993) elasticities of poverty measures w.r.t the mean,
which hold inequality constant. On the conceptual distinction between Kakwani’s partial elasticities and the total
elasticities used here see Ravallion (2007).

The (log) poverty rate moves with the (log) mean nationally using all three poverty
measures (Table 3a). The official series (1970-2016) has slightly lower elasticity than the
PovcalNet series (1984-2016). As expected, the relative poverty measures respond less
elastically to the mean, though it is still a significant response. The official measures responded
to the mean for each of the three main ethnic groups. The “other” group is the exception. The
following analysis will take the difference-in-logs specification to be preferable for the 𝜂𝜂̂ 𝑖𝑖 ’s.

There is a possible bias in these regressions due to time-varying measurement errors in

the log-differences, though the sign of that bias is unknown. There is the usual attenuation bias
from measurement errors in the regressor, but also a potentially offsetting bias due to the likely
negative correlation with the measurement errors in the dependent variable. (If one under/over
estimates the mean from a given survey then one will tend to over/under estimate the poverty
rate.) An independent proxy for the survey mean can provide a valid instrumental variable (IV)
under the assumption that measurement errors in that proxy are uncorrelated with those in the
survey. National accounts consumption is a candidate IV, given that it is often determined
residually in developing countries, including Malaysia (rather than being calibrated directly to
survey data). Estimates using this IV have suggested little bias in OLS estimates of the growth
elasticity of poverty reduction (Ravallion, 2001). In the present context, one is limited by the
absence of an ethnic breakdown of the national accounts. The first-stage regression was
satisfactory on using both current and lagged growth rates in real private consumption per capita
from the national accounts as the IVs for the growth rate in the survey mean (F=3.40;
prob.=0.062). The IV estimate of the elasticity of the official poverty measures to the survey
mean is -2.67 (s.e.=0.67), fairly close to the OLS estimate of -2.36 (Table 3, panel a). The first
stage was also satisfactory for the Bumiputera (F=3.37; prob.=0.064), and this gave an IV
estimate of -2.28 (s.e.=0.67), again close to Table 3(b). However, the first stages did not have
satisfactory power for the Chinese, Indians or others, so the IV estimates could not be trusted for
these groups. Sensitivity tests will be performed to see how robust the decomposition might be to
biases in these parameters.
Motivated by the results in Table 3, the following analysis will assume benchmark values
of 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 of -2 for the Bumiputera, and -3 for each of the Chinese and Indians, and 0 for “others,”

giving a share-weighted overall elasticity of -2.23 using initial shares of poverty (-1.94 using
final shares). This is fairly close to the regression-based elasticity in Table 3 (panel a) for the
23

official poverty measures using the difference specification. The first two components of (6) can
then be calculated. The last term, due to changes in population composition by ethnicity, is nonparametric and so can be calculated directly from the data. The intra-group distributional term
not attributable to growth can then be determined residually.
Table 4 gives results for the decomposition in (6) using both initial and final year shares
of poverty as the weights. As noted, the overall rate of poverty reduction is almost 10% per
annum. The pure growth effect is 7.7% per annum (averaging the results for base-year and finalyear weights), representing 78% of the total. The contribution of inter-ethnic redistribution is a
decline in poverty of almost exactly 1% per annum. The implied contribution of intra-group
distributional shifts not accountable to growth in the within-group means is a 1.5% per annum
decline in the poverty rate. The population effect is poverty increasing, as expected, though the
effect is small, representing only 0.3% per annum.
Recall that the IVs from national accounts data were too weak for addressing
measurement error concerns related to the regressions for the Chinese and Indians in Table 3(b).
Recognizing this uncertainty, Table 4 also provides two sensitivity tests, “High-case” and “Lowcase” options, using -3.5 and -2.5 as the growth elasticities respectively, for both the Chinese and
Indians (keeping -2 for the Bumiputera and 0 for others). The ethnic redistribution component is
quite robust to this change, staying at around 10% of the overall rate of poverty reduction. The
growth component rises (falls) slightly using the higher (lower) elasticities, while the intra-group
distributional component does the opposite.
So these calculations indicate that the reduction in ethnic inequality accounted for about
one tenth of the overall rate of poverty reduction. Recall that these results are for the official
poverty measures and that the (weakly) relative measures provided in Section 3 are more
responsive to inequality. While the calculations are not feasible for relative poverty (given the
aforementioned constraints on data access), it is very likely that lower ethnic inequality
contributed more to the reduction in relative poverty than for absolute poverty. Recall that the
distributional component switched from 25% of total absolute poverty reduction to 43% using
the relative measure. It should not matter much to the impact on poverty whether the
redistribution is between or within groups so this can be taken as an indication of the likely
upward adjustment to the inter-ethnic share, which would then account for around 17% of the
reduction in the national relative poverty rate.
24

Inter-ethnic redistribution and aggregate poverty: While lower ethnic inequality has
been poverty reducing in Malaysia, we have seen in the results above that the effect has been
rather modest compared to the impact of growth in the mean. The question is begging: after 50
years of effort to reduce ethnic inequality, have the potential gains to Malaysia’s poor been
exhausted?
To address this question, consider again the theoretical scenario sketched in Section 1,
entailing a redistribution of income from group j to group i, holding the overall mean constant:

𝑦𝑦 𝑑𝑑𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖

Here 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 ≡ 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 /𝜇𝜇. Recall that the aggregate poverty rate is 𝐻𝐻 = ∑4𝑖𝑖=1 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 . Then we have:
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝐻𝐻

The term in parentheses is the elasticity of the national poverty rate to an increase in the mean of
group i at the expense of group j, holding the overall mean constant. I shall call this the “ethnic
redistribution elasticity.” We would expect this elasticity to be low for redistribution from
Chinese to Indians, since the two groups have fairly similar shares of poverty and income (Table
2), and similar growth elasticities (Table 3). It is less clear what elasticity to expect from Chinese
to Bumiputera redistribution—while the Bumiputera have a large share of poverty, they have a
lower growth elasticity—and how this would vary over time.
Figure 11 gives the redistributive elasticities over time. We see that the elasticities are
higher (most negative) for redistribution between the Chinese and the Bumiputera, and close to
zero for redistribution from the Chinese to Indians. Also, note that the elasticities for
redistribution from Chinese to Bumiputera have not fallen over time; indeed there is a trend
increase (more negative elasticities). Despite the signs of (relative) economic convergence by
ethnicity, the poverty-reducing efficacy of ethnic redistribution from the Chinese to the
Bumiputera has remained high.
It might be conjectured that the high recent elasticities are an artifact of the assumption of
constant elasticities of poverty to growth over time for each ethnic group. This is not the case.
Panel (c) of Table 3 includes interaction effects with time in the log-difference specification. The
25

elasticity has decreased (becoming more negative) over time for the Bumiputera and Chinese,
reaching about -5 by 2016. Using an elasticity of -5 in 2016 for both groups one obtains an
ethnic redistribution elasticity of -3.7 instead of -1.3.

Conclusions
In the wake of the 1969 race riots, the twin aims of Malaysia’s New Economic Policy

were ethnic redistribution and poverty reduction. To varying degrees, successive governments
have intervened against ethnic inequality. Over the same period, the country has seen enormous
progress against poverty. Indeed the official poverty rate has gone from about 50% to virtually
zero, although the old official poverty line is probably too low by prevailing standards. The
alternative (weakly-relative) measure of poverty proposed here shows a similar pattern over
time, and indicates a near halving of the poverty rate over 1984-2016, though it also suggests that
Malaysia still has some way to go before it can claim to have eliminated poverty.
Malaysia can also claim more success than many countries in managing inequality. The
Gini index of household incomes fell from 0.51 in 1970 to 0.40 in 2016. This was due to
progress in reducing ethnic inequality. The paper finds that the reduction in overall inequality
played a non-negligible role in the country’s success at reducing poverty, in combination with
economic growth. There have also been clear signs of relative convergence in mean household
incomes between the main ethnic groups. The mean income of the lagging Bumiputera has
grown at a faster rate since 1970 than that for either the Chinese or Indians.
The paper’s measures of ethnic inequality show a large reduction over these 50 years.
Nonetheless, the ethnic differential in growth rates has not been enough to attenuate the large
absolute gaps in mean incomes by ethnicity. Importantly, there is no sign of a robust effect of the
growth process on inequality within ethnic groups. It is not the case, for example, that the higher
growth rate for the Bumiputera in the wake of the NEP was shared unevenly among the
Bumiputera when one defines “uneven” in terms of proportionate changes. However, that growth
did come with rising absolute inequality.
The paper’s results suggest that progress in reducing ethnic inequality has played a nonnegligible role in reducing national poverty over these 50 years. Using the official poverty
measures, about 10% of the overall rate of poverty reduction is accountable to reduced inequality
26

in average incomes between the main ethnic groups. (Using the proposed relative poverty
measure it would probably rise to about 17%.) Inequality reduction within ethnic groups has
played a somewhat more important role than ethnic redistribution. However, overall economic
growth has been the more important driver quantitatively. Changes in the ethnic composition of
the population tended to be poverty increasing, though this effect turns out to be small.
While the reduction in ethnic inequality has not been as quantitatively important to
poverty reduction as overall growth that does not imply that ethnic redistribution is a blunt tool
against poverty in this setting. Nor do the facts that both ethnic inequality and poverty have been
reduced substantially imply that ethnic inequality no longer matters to poverty. Indeed, the paper
finds quite sizable elasticities of national poverty to inequality-reducing ethnic redistribution.
And the elasticities have stayed high—indeed, they have increased—through this period of
ethnic redistribution and poverty reduction spanning 50 years. The potential gains to poor
Malaysians from progress toward ethnic equality do not appear to have been exhausted. Even
small reductions, or increases, in ethnic inequality can still matter.
