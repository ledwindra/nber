ABSTRACT
We investigate the importance of ambiguity, or Knightian uncertainty, in executives’ decisions about
when to exercise stock options. We develop an empirical estimate of ambiguity and include it in regression
models alongside the more traditional measure of risk, equity volatility. We show that each variable
has a statistically significant effect on the timing of option exercises, with volatility causing executives
to hold their options longer in order to preserve remaining option value, and ambiguity increasing
the tendency for executives to exercise early in response to risk aversion. Regression estimates for
the volatility and ambiguity variables imply similar magnitudes of economic impact upon the exercise
decision, with the volatility variable being about 2.5 times stronger.

Risk, Ambiguity, and
the Exercise of Employee Stock Options

I.

Introduction

This paper explores the role of Knightian uncertainty, also known as ambiguity, in executives’
decisions about when to exercise their stock options.

Our results should help clarify a

longstanding division (or ambiguity) in the compensation literature over whether risk is
positively or negatively associated with the early exercise of executive options. Two competing
hypotheses predict that risk may cause executives to exercise stock options early, due to their
impulse to diversify, or alternatively, that risk may cause options holders to delay exercise, since
the remaining option value increases when risk is high. Table 1 lists six major studies of
employee stock option exercises in recent years, using very large datasets with observations
ranging between 1985 and 2009. These studies are decidedly split on whether greater risk, as
measured by equity volatility, predicts earlier or later exercise of options.
In our regression model of option exercises, we introduce the concept of ambiguity
alongside the more widely used measure of equity volatility, because each of these measures of
risk is potentially important to employee option holders. Ambiguity is based upon the concept of
Knightian uncertainty, introduced in Knight’s (1921) treatise on Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit.
Knightian uncertainty refers to conditions under which the set of events that may occur are a
priori unknown, and the odds of these possible events are also either not unique or are unknown.
Knightian uncertainty is distinctly different than volatility and related measures of financial risk,
which typically treat the set of future outcomes (such as the range of future stock prices) as
known, with certain probabilities assigned to them and adding to one. The most familiar public
2

discussion of Knightian uncertainty probably occurred in 2002, when U.S. Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld drew a distinction between “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns”
when discussing hypothetical chemical weapons held by Iraq.
Previous studies have focused on the theoretical aspect of ambiguity, while not testing
their models empirically. In general these studies employ decision models that do not provide
separation between risk and ambiguity and between preferences and beliefs. Therefore, they do
not provide a straightforward way for measuring ambiguity.1 We believe our study is the first to
introduce ambiguity into an option pricing model, and we use an empirical method to estimate
the impact of ambiguity upon the timing of stock option exercises while controlling for the
impact of volatility, the more traditional measure of risk. We find that ambiguity and volatility
measure distinctly separate aspects of financial uncertainty, as they have a simple correlation that
is weakly positive but not far from zero.
Our analysis provides consistent evidence that both volatility and ambiguity are
significantly associated with option exercises, but in opposite directions.

Our regression

estimates indicate that high ambiguity is associated with earlier option exercises, while high
volatility is associated with later exercises. Ambiguity therefore appears to influence exercise
policy through the channel more commonly described as risk aversion. The magnitudes of the
coefficient estimates for the two variables imply that they operate with very similar economic
strength in executives’ exercise decisions, with the volatility variable appearing to have about 2.5
times as much influence as the ambiguity variable.
Our results add to a growing literature of papers that fit models of stock option exercise
using predictor variables beyond those that appear in the classical binomial or Black-Scholes
1

Earlier literature dealt with this limitation either by calibration (for example, Ju and Miao (2011)) or by attributing
the disagreement of professional forecasters to ambiguity (for example, Anderson et al. (2009)).

models. In addition to the papers listed in Table 1, an interesting related paper is Spalt (2013),
which studies awards rather than exercises of executive stock options. Like us, the author of that
paper uses a framework based on cumulative prospect theory to estimate employees’ perceived
value of option awards, with the results of the paper hinging upon a transformation of
probabilities of future realizations of the underlying stock price such that employees’ beliefs
deviate from the true distribution. The author finds that firms with high idiosyncratic volatility
grant more options to their employees, a result that can be supported by prospect theory but not
by classical option pricing models.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a theoretical
discussion of ambiguity and develops our hypotheses. Section III describes our sample selection
and variable definitions, including the estimates of the ambiguity and volatility variables that are
central to our investigation. Section IV presents regression analysis of option exercise, and
Section V concludes the paper.

Ambiguity

Many real-life financial decisions involve ambiguity. As a simple example, suppose two urns
contain a mixture of black and yellow balls in unknown and possibly different proportions, and
you are offered a prize for selecting a yellow ball with only one attempt. The first urn contains
30 balls, and the second urn contains 10. From which urn should you choose to make your
selection?
Treating ambiguity analytically can help decision-makers to rank order alternatives such
as the two urns in the game above. With employee stock options, the decision above is similar to

4

the decision of whether to continue holding an option or to exercise it when the degree of
ambiguity changes.

II.1.

The decision theoretic model of ambiguity

Knightian uncertainty has provided the basis for a rich literature in decision theory that begins
with Schmeidler (1989) and Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). These pioneering studies provide
axiomatic foundations for modeling decision making under ambiguity, and they suggest that in
the presence of ambiguity, an individual's beliefs may take the form of either multiple priors or a
single but nonadditive prior. In their model of max-min expected utility with multiple priors,
Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) assert that an ambiguity-averse individual possesses a set of priors
and evaluates her ex ante welfare conditional upon the worst prior. The subjective nonadditive
probabilities of Gilboa (1987), the Choquet expected utility of Schmeidler (1989) and the
cumulative prospect theory of Tversky and Kahneman (1992) suggest that, in the presence of
ambiguity, the probabilities that reflect the individual's willingness to bet might not be additive.
Earlier literature on ambiguity focuses mainly on its theoretical aspects, with special
attention to the implications of ambiguity for the equity premium. See, for example, Cao et al.
(2005), Nau (2006), Epstein and Schneider (2008) and Izhakian and Benninga (2011). Other
studies attempt to provide explanations for puzzling asset pricing phenomena by introducing
ambiguity into conventional asset pricing models. For example, Pflug and Wozabal (2007) and
Boyle et al. (2011) suggest extensions of the mean–variance approach to incorporate ambiguity.
Additional papers have developed extensions of the capital asset pricing model that incorporate
ambiguity, such as Chen and Epstein (2002), Maccheroni et al. (2009) and Izhakian (2012b).

5

We distinguish the concepts of risk and ambiguity by using the theoretical framework of
expected utility with uncertain probabilities (EUUP). EUUP, proposed by Izhakian (2012a), is
based on Schmeidler's (1989) Choquet expected utility but puts more structure on subjective
probabilities (capacities) and adds reference-dependent beliefs. Like Tversky and Kahneman's
(1992) cumulative prospect theory, EUUP assumes that investors have a reference point relative
to which outcomes are classified as unfavorable (a loss) or as favorable (a gain). Outcomes
below than the reference point are considered unfavorable, and higher outcomes are considered
favorable. The cumulative probability of unfavorable outcomes plays an important role in
estimating the degree of ambiguity. Unlike cumulative prospect theory, EUUP does not assume
different attitudes toward risk for losses and for gains (i.e., loss aversion).
EUUP assumes that a random variable is subject to two tiers of uncertainty, one with
respect to the value of outcomes, and the other with respect to the probabilities of these
outcomes.

Each tier of uncertainty is modeled by a separate state space.

This structure

introduces a complete distinction of risk from ambiguity with regard to both beliefs and
preferences. The degree of risk and investors' attitudes toward it are then measured with respect
to the first space, while ambiguity and investors' attitudes toward it are measured with respect to
the second space.

In our approach, the separability of risk and ambiguity represents an

assumption. While previous literature (e.g., Schmeidler (1989) and Gilboa and Schmeidler
(1989)) makes a considerable contribution to understanding preferences with respect to
ambiguity, a complete separation between ambiguity and risk has not yet been derived.
Formally, let

Investors have distinct preferences concerning risk and concerning ambiguity. As usual,
preferences concerning risk are modeled by a strictly-increasing, continuous and twicedifferentiable utility function

ambiguity aversion occurs when an investor prefers the expectation of an uncertain probability of
each outcome over the uncertain probability itself.2
Because individuals may interpret random probabilities in nonlinear ways, perceived
probabilities in EUUP are nonadditive, meaning that they do not necessarily add to 1.
Ambiguity aversion results in a subadditive probability measure, while ambiguity loving results
in a superadditive measure. The expected utility of consuming the future risky and ambiguous

Binomial example

In this section we illustrate the impact of ambiguity and risk on option prices with a simple
numerical example. Consider an underlying equity whose current price is $1. In the next period
its price can be either $1.1 or $0.9, i.e., respectively +10% or -10% returns. Assume an
ambiguity-averse investor of a constant absolute ambiguity aversion type with coefficient of

. Recall that the reference point distinguishes between losses and gains.

Let a one period call option have an exercise price

and assume that the

probabilities of each, the bad outcome and the good outcome, are exactly 50%, which means that
no ambiguity is present. In this case, the variance of the probability of the favorable outcome is
0 and therefore, by substituting into equation (5), the value of the call option is is
. If the risk of the underlying equity increases such that the bad and the good
outcomes are, respectively, $0.8 and $1.2, then the value of the call option increases to

Hypotheses

We turn now to developing our hypotheses based upon the claims of Section II.2. In particular,
Claim 1 proposes that a higher volatility of the underlying equity implies a higher value of the
option. On the other hand, Claim 3 proposes that a higher ambiguity of the underlying equity
implies a lower value of the option. These claims suggest that the risk and the ambiguity
associated with the underlying equity have opposite effects on the incentive that employees have
to exercise their vested options.

Hypothesis H1: When the expected risk associated with the underlying asset is high, employees
tend to hold their options rather than exercise them, and vice versa.
At each interval of time, an option holder has to decide whether to exercise his vested
options or keep the option alive and defer the decision to the next period. His choice is based
upon the future expected value of the option relative to its current value, assuming that the
market price of the underlying equity reflects its value in terms of expected utility. If the option
holder expects the volatility of the underlying equity to be high in the next month, then he
anticipates a higher value of option in the next month. Therefore, to maximize his expected
utility, he would prefer to continue holding the option and leave it unexercised.

Hypothesis H2: When the expected ambiguity associated with the underlying asset is high,
employees tend to exercise their options rather than hold them, and vice versa.
12

Claim 3 demonstrates that ambiguity and option value are negatively related. This means
that if the ambiguity of the underlying asset is expected to be high, the value of an option on this
equity is expected to be low.

Data description

III.1. Sample selection
We estimate the relation between ambiguity and the timing of option exercises using a sample
from Table 2 of the Thomson Reuters Insiders Data database. After a process of data cleaning
and filtering described below, we analyze 63,244 option exercises by 19,192 employees in 3,006
individual firms. Our unit of observation for regression analysis is an award-month, and we
include each month for which an option is vested (or exercisable) and not yet fully exercised,
2,142,732 observations in all.
To construct our sample, we begin with a download of 5,322,257 records from the entire
Thomson Reuters database from January 1996 to December 2013, with each record representing
either an award or an exercise of a given grant to a given employee in a specific firm. Each
unique grant is identified using the firm identifier, security identifier, person identifier, vesting
date and termination date. When one of these descriptors is missing, we attempt to complete it
using information from other records of the same grant. After this data cleaning, we drop all
records missing one of the following descriptors: vesting date, expiration date, number of
options, or exercise price. In addition, we drop all records that we cannot match with identifiers
to the CRSP stock price database. This filtering leaves us with 3,862,174 records. After
dropping duplicate records, 3,552,491 are left.

13

Next, we aggregate the exercise and cancellation transactions related to each grant on a
monthly basis. All grants that are never exercised are dropped (many may have expired out of
the money, some are still active today, and others may have been exercised after the option
holder left the company and had no reporting obligation). We identify 107,930 unique option
grants for which we have both award and exercise data. For each month for each of these grants,
we construct a cumulative total of the number of vested options that have not yet been exercised.
When the database reports an exercise quantity equal to or exceeding the number of options held,
we consider the observation to represent an exercise of all of the remaining options and drop all
future months. Using this method, we are left with a sample of 4,007,854 monthly observations
for the 107,930 unique grants, representing the period between the vesting date and the exercise
date for each grant.
We reduce this sample of 4,007,854 observations to a sample suitable for regression
analysis after calculating the necessary independent variables for each observation. In general
we require 12 months of stock price history to construct measures of expected volatility and
expected ambiguity from daily and intraday returns as described below. This was possible for
2,586,265 observations. Finally, we drop all out-of-the-money options, based upon the closing
price at the end of the prior month. This leaves us with 2,142,732 monthly observations during
which employees could have exercised their options.

Our main dependent variable is the

percentage of options exercised by the option holder in a particular month, equal to the number
exercised over the number held at the start of the month. Because option exercises occur only
infrequently, for most months this variable equals zero. This property of the data suggests that a
Tobit estimation would be most appropriate, but it was not possible for us to fit a Tobit model
with fixed effects and clustered standard errors. Therefore, we a general linear mixed model

14

(GLMM) with clustering and fixed effects in the regression analysis below. In unreported
sensitivity tests, we find little difference between our reported GLMM estimates and Tobit
estimates without fixed effects and clustered standard errors.

III.2. Estimating expected ambiguity
To estimate the degree of ambiguity of a given underlying asset from trading data, one must first
elicit the possible probabilities of unfavorable outcomes (returns). To do so, one must make
assumptions about the nature of the probability distribution of returns and the investors’
reference point. We define the reference point to be the risk-free rate of return, denoted . That
is, any return lower than

is considered an unfavorable and any return greater than

is

considered favorable (alternatively, one could take 0 to be the reference point). In addition we
assume that returns on assets are log-normally distributed; therefore, the degree of ambiguity of
the return

on the underlying asset can be measured by
[ ]
(

where

(

outcome and

)

and

√

∫

[ (

)],

(7)

)

is the cumulative probability of unfavorable

are the random mean and the random variance of the return on the

underlying equity, respectively.
We employ the empirical method developed by Brenner and Izhakian (2011, 2012) to
estimate the degree of ambiguity using intraday stock trading data from the TAQ database. We
compute the degree of ambiguity given in Equation (7), for each stock and for each month, by
applying the following procedure. We sample the price of the stock every five minutes starting
from 9:30 until 16:00. In cases where there is no trade at a specific time interval, we take the
15

volume-weighted average of the closest trading price. Using these prices we compute fiveminute returns, 78 times for each day. Note that this procedure implies that we ignore returns
between each closing price and opening price on the following day, thereby eliminating the
impact of overnight price changes and dividend distributions. For each stock, we drop all trading
days that do not have at least 15 quotes representing different five minute time intervals, and we
drop all trading months that do not have at least 15 days that satisfy this condition. Observations
with extreme price changes (minus or plus 20 percent log returns) within five minutes are also
dropped.
For a given stock, for each day we compute the mean and variance of five-minute returns
applying the adjustment for non-synchronous trading proposed by Scholes and Williams (1977)
and a correction for heteroscedasticity. Then, by the assumption that the intraday returns are lognormally distributed, we compute for each day the probability of an unfavorable outcome (loss)
using the cumulative normal probability distribution.

For each month, there are 20 to 22

different loss-probabilities. From these loss-probabilities we compute the standard deviation of
the probability of loss to obtain the degree of ambiguity,
month. The average ambiguity
examine the natural logarithm of

, for an individual stock in a given

(over firms) is positively skewed. To adjust for skewness, we
. Finally, we assume that investors form an expectation

about future ambiguity by taking into account the evolution of a given stock’s ambiguity over
time. Regression analysis indicates that the average autocorrelations (over firms) of
decays beyond lag 9, suggesting that

(

(

)

) follows a nine-order autoregressive process.

Based upon the Akaike information criterion (AIC), for each equity , we estimate the
conditional ambiguity using an AR(7) with one period autocorrelated residuals model of the

16

time-series of the natural logarithm of ambiguity. For every month we perform the following
time-series regression for each equity :

Then we estimate the expected ambiguity by

where

III.3. Estimating expected volatility
Along with ambiguity, volatility serves as the most important explanatory variable in our
analysis. We compute volatility with standard methods, using daily log returns adjusted for
dividends obtained from the CRSP database. For each individual stock in a given month we
calculate the standard deviation,

of the stock’s daily returns over that month, again applying

the Scholes and Williams (1977) correction for non-synchronous trading and a correction for
heteroscedasticity.4 As with ambituity, the average volatility measures

(over firms) are also

positively skewed. To adjust for skewness we examine the natural logarithm of

assume that investors form an expectation about future volatility based upon its evolution over

and we then estimate the expected volatility by

where ̂

III.3. Other explanatory variables
In addition to expected ambiguity and expected volatility, our models of option exercises include
a number of standard control variables, many of them based on the prior studies listed in Table 1.
We include two indicators related to behavioral finance predictions. One indicator equals one
during the vesting month, representing the first month in which a given option award can be
exercised, and we expect this to have a positive association with the probability of exercise. The
other indicator equals one if the stock hits a 12-month high during the prior month, and we also
expect this variable to have a positive association with the probability of exercise. The log of
remaining option life (measured as one plus the number of months to expiration) should exhibit a
negative relation with the probability of exercise, based on standard comparative statics of option
value with respect to time, while the dividend yield of the underlying stock should exhibit a
positive relation for the same reason. Following Carpenter, Stanton, and Wallace (2013), we
multiply the dividend yield times an indicator that equals one if a dividend is payable in the
current month. We include the log of the ratio of prior month-end stock price divided by the
option exercise price to capture the depth in-the-money of each option award, and we expect this
variable to exhibit a positive association with the probability of exercise. In certain regressions
18

we use the change in ambiguity and change in volatility as explanatory variables, and these are
calculated as the log of the ratio of the current month’s value over the prior month’s value.
Table 2 presents summary statistics for the key variables used in the paper, and Table 3
presents a correlation matrix for these variables. The two measures of risk, expected volatility
and expected ambiguity, are only weakly related to one another, with an estimated correlation of
0.186. This suggests that the two variables capture economically distinct aspects of financial
uncertainty.

Empirical results

Our regression analysis of how risk impacts executives stock option exercises appears in Table 4.
As described above, the sample for analysis includes more than 2.14 million award-month
observations in which an executive holds vested, in-the-money options at the start of the month
and faces a decision of whether to exercise the option or continue it for another month.

The

dependent variable in all models is the percentage of an award that is exercised in a given month.
All models include standard errors clustered by person, firm, month, and year in order to reflect
the lack of independence of multiple observations within executives and within periods of time.
The first two columns of Table 4 show estimates for very basic models with only an
intercept and the volatility variable, in the first column, and an intercept and the ambiguity
variable, in the second column. Both risk variables appear in a model with an intercept in the
third column, and their estimates change little when they are included in the same regression
alongside one another.

The volatility variable has a negative and significant estimate of

approximately -0.15, while the ambiguity variable has a positive and significant estimate of
approximately +0.02. Moving from left to right in Table 4, we introduce control variables as

described above and fixed effects for years, persons, and firms. Finally, in the right column of
Table 4, we show estimates for the most general model, with all control variables and fixed
effects included. Both the volatility and ambiguity variables have significant estimates in every
column except one, and they remain relatively unchanged when control variables are added.
Our results imply that risk impacts the option exercise decision in a multi-faceted way, as
we find that the volatility and ambiguity variables influence exercises in opposite directions.
Our negative and significant estimates for the volatility variable are similar to those found in the
recent study by Carpenter, Stanton, and Wallace (2013), the only one of the six papers listed in
Table 1 that finds this pattern unambiguously. The Carpenter et al. study appears to have several
advantages compared to the others in the table, including a much larger sample over a far longer
time period, as well as a more sophisticated estimation method. However, none of the papers
considers measures of uncertainty other than the traditional volatility variable, and one of the
contributions of our paper appears to be our illustration that different types of uncertainty impact
financial decisions sometimes in opposing directions.
To assess the economic significance of the two variables’ estimates, we multiply the
coefficients in the right column of Table 4 by the standard deviation of each variable as shown in
Table 2. The product represents the impact on the exercise decision of a one standard deviation
change of each variable.

For the volatility variable the relevant calculation is

or about 0.18%, and for the ambiguity variable the calculation is

, or

about 0.07%, implying that the equity volatility variable as about two and a half times stronger
influence upon executives’ exercise decisions. The unconditional mean of the dependent
variable, as shown in Table 2, is about 2.54%. The two uncertainty variables therefore appear to

20

have meaningful, but somewhat modest, impact on executives’ month-to-month decisions about
whether to exercise their stock options.
Other estimates for variables in Table 4 follow the expected pattern found in other
papers. Managers are significantly more likely to exercise their stock options soon after the
underlying shares reach a 12-month high, and also in the first month after vesting. While the
former result seems to be rooted in behavioral finance, the latter may be an artifact of certain
executives planning to change jobs but waiting until their options vest and can be liquidated. We
find that options are more likely to be exercised when they are deep in-the-money, when large
dividends are payable in the current month, and when the time to expiration grows shorter. All
three of these results square with standard comparative statics predictions.
In tables 5 and 6 we present a series of robustness tests to show the consistency of our
estimates for the two uncertainty variables. Table 5 displays estimates for regressions with the
same specification as the right column of Table 4, in which we include the full range of control
variables and fixed effects, alongside three alternative specifications of the volatility and
ambiguity variables. We tabulate only the intercept and two uncertainty variables’ coefficients
in order to save space and highlight the important results. In the first column of Table 5, we
reproduce the estimates from the right column of Table 4 for comparison purposes. In the
second column of the table, the two uncertainty variables are measured one month earlier, and in
the third column, they are measured with two months’ lag. Finally, in the right column we take
the first difference of each uncertainty variable, equal to the value at the close of the immediately
preceding month, minus the value one month earlier. In all four columns of Table 5, the
estimates for the uncertainty variables have the same sign, significance, and approximate

21

magnitude, although the coefficients are noticeably closer to zero in the right column when we
use the first-difference specification.
In Table 6, we continue our robustness tests by fitting our regression model over certain
subsets of observations. In the first column, we look at observations for chief executive officers
only, according to their job titles reported in the Thomson Reuters database. These option
exercises comprise about 16% of the overall sample. In the center column, we estimate our
regression for those observations in the top quartile of the volatility variable, and in the right
column, we use those observations that lie in the top 25% of ambiguity. All models contain the
full range of control variables and fixed effects used in the preceding table. Once again we find
a high degree of similarity for the uncertainty variables’ coefficient estimates, as each variable
retains its sign, significance, and approximate magnitude within each of these subsamples of
observations.

V.

Conclusion

We investigate the importance of ambiguity, or Knightian uncertainty, in executives’ decisions
about when to exercise stock options. The impact of risk on the timing of option exercise has
motivated several prior studies which have failed to reach a conclusion about whether the
relation is positive or negative. Our contribution involves the introduction of a second measure
of uncertainty, ambiguity, alongside the more traditional measure of volatility. The empirical
estimates of these two quantities exhibit only a modest correlation, and both turn out to be
important. We show that each variable has a statistically significant effect on the timing of
option exercises, with volatility causing executives to hold their options longer in order to
preserve remaining option value, and ambiguity increasing the tendency for executives to

22

exercise early in response to risk aversion. Regression estimates for volatility and ambiguity
variables imply very similar magnitudes of economic impact upon the exercise decision, with the
volatility variable appearing to impact about 2.5 times more strongly than the ambiguity variable.

Descriptive statistics
The table shows descriptive statistics for the key dependent and explanatory variables in the regression analysis of option exercise
timing. The sample includes 2.14 million monthly observations associated with 63,244 option grants that are exercised by 19,192
employees in 3,006 individual firms between 1996 and 2013, using records from the Thomson Reuters Insiders Data file. For a given
option award, the percentage of options exercised is the number exercised in a given month divided by the number of vested options
held at the start of the month. Expected volatility, based on CRSP daily stock price records, and expected ambiguity, based on TAQ
intra-day stock price records, are calculated according to procedures described in the text.
