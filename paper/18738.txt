ABSTRACT
Despite the importance attributed to the effects of diversity on the stability and prosperity of nations,
the origins of the uneven distribution of ethnic and cultural fragmentation across countries have been
underexplored. Building on the role of deeply-rooted biogeographical forces in comparative development,
this research empirically demonstrates that genetic diversity, predominantly determined during the
prehistoric "out of Africa" migration of humans, is an underlying cause of various existing manifestations
of ethnolinguistic heterogeneity. Further exploration of this uncharted territory may revolutionize the
understanding of the effects of deeply-rooted factors on economic development and the composition
of human capital across the globe.

Diversity has emerged as a fundamental force in the stability and prosperity of nations.

The

intensities of fractionalization and polarization across ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups have
been associated with economic growth, the quality of governance, the provision of public goods, the
prevalence of civil con‡ict, and endogenous nation formation.1 Nevertheless, the origins of the uneven
distribution of ethnic and cultural fragmentation across countries have been largely neglected.2
An emerging body of evidence suggests that deeply-rooted factors, determined tens of thousands of years ago, have signi…cantly a¤ected the level of diversity and the course of comparative
economic development from the dawn of human civilization to the contemporary era.3 In particular,
Ashraf and Galor (2013) advance and empirically establish the hypothesis that, in the course of
the prehistoric exodus of Homo sapiens out of Africa, migratory distance to various indigenous
settlements across the globe adversely a¤ected the level of genetic diversity, and thereby generated a
persistent hump-shaped e¤ect on development outcomes, re‡ecting the tradeo¤ between the bene…cial
and detrimental e¤ects of diversity on productivity.
Building upon the insight of the biogeographical roots of comparative development, this paper
explores an underlying unity in the origins of the various forms of ethnic and cultural fragmentation
in contemporary national populations. It advances the hypothesis that genetic diversity, determined
predominantly during the migration of humans out of Africa tens of thousands of years ago, is a
fundamental determinant of observed ethnic and cultural heterogeneity, as re‡ected by the number
of ethnic groups and the levels of ethnolinguistic fractionalization and polarization within modern
national boundaries.
Following the “out of Africa” migration, the initial level of genetic diversity in indigenous
settlements presumably facilitated the formation of distinct ethnic groups through a process of
endogenous group selection, based on the tradeo¤ between the costs and bene…ts associated with
heterogeneity and scale.4 While heterogeneity raised the likelihood of disarray and mistrust, reducing
cooperation and thus adversely a¤ecting group-speci…c productivity, complementarities across diverse
productive traits and preferences stimulated productivity. Since in a given environment, diminishing
marginal returns to diversity and homogeneity entail an optimal size for each group, higher initial
genetic diversity would have positively contributed to the number of groups, and thus to the degree
of fractionalization. Further, to the extent that higher initial diversity did not lead to an excessively
large number of groups, it would have positively contributed to the degree of polarization as well.5
Consistent with the proposed hypothesis, this research establishes that genetic diversity is
an underlying cause of a broad spectrum of existing manifestations of ethnic and cultural diversity.
Exploiting migratory distance from East Africa as an exogenous source of cross-country variation in
contemporary genetic diversity, the empirical analysis demonstrates that genetic diversity has signi…1

Over time, as the forces of cultural drift augmented intergroup divergences in language, customs, and norms,
thereby reinforcing the barriers to intergroup assimilation, distinct ethnic identities were formed.
5
If local geographical factors complemented a speci…c spectrum of productive traits and preferences, genetic diversity,
coupled with spatial variability in geographical factors, may have facilitated the sorting of the regional population into
spatially segregated communities, and thus the e¤ect of genetic diversity on the degree of fractionalization or polarization
could potentially be nonmonotonic.

and polarization, conditional on a comprehensive set of potentially confounding geographical and
historical factors.

Estimation Strategy

The empirical analysis examines the average reduced-form e¤ects of genetic diversity on a wide
range of measures of contemporary ethnolinguistic heterogeneity at the country level, including (i)
the log number of ethnic groups (EG), compiled by Fearon (2003); (ii) two distinct measures of
ethnic fractionalization (EF-F and EF-A), constructed by Fearon (2003) and Alesina et al. (2003),
respectively; (iii) indices of ethnolinguistic fractionalization (ELF-D) and polarization (POL-D),
based on deeply-rooted ancestral cleavages among linguistic groups in the population (i.e., level
1), developed by Desmet, Ortuño-Ortín and Wacziarg (2012); and (iv) measures of ethnolinguistic
polarization, based on the methodologies of Esteban-Ray (POL-ER) and Reynal-Querol (POL-RQ),
constructed by Esteban, Mayoral and Ray (2012).
Given that cross-country migrations in the post-1500 era signi…cantly a¤ected the distribution
of genetic and cultural diversity, especially across countries in the New World, the measure of
contemporary genetic diversity developed by Ashraf and Galor (2013) is employed as the main
independent variable. However, since this measure may be spuriously correlated with the component of contemporary ethnolinguistic diversity that was shaped by the forces of colonialism and
globalization over the past 500 years, two distinct identi…cation strategies are utilized.

First,

the analysis focuses on a subsample comprised exclusively of countries in the Old World, thereby
eliminating the potentially confounding role of mass migrations from the Old World in contributing
to both genetic and ethnolinguistic diversity in New-World populations over the past half millennium.
Second, the analysis employs migratory distance from East Africa as an instrument for contemporary
genetic diversity in a global sample of countries, exploiting the highly signi…cant negative …rst-stage
relationship between genetic diversity and migratory distance from the cradle of humankind.6
The analysis also accounts for a large vector of geographical covariates. Speci…cally, in light
of the hypothesis of Michalopoulos (2012) that geographical variability, as re‡ected by variations
in regional land quality and elevation, contributed signi…cantly to ethnolinguistic fractionalization,
controls are introduced for the mean and the standard deviation of land quality and elevation as
well as the dispersion in elevation within a country.7 Further, since ecological biodiversity decreases
with distance from the equator, a spatial gradient that is also manifested by linguistic diversity,
absolute latitude is included as a standard control. Moreover, to account for other geographicallydriven channels that may have shaped endogenous group formation, promoted spatial segregation, or
reinforced intergroup di¤erences through cultural drift and the accumulation of group-speci…c human
6

As discussed by Ashraf and Galor (2013), this relationship re‡ects a serial founder e¤ect of the “out of Africa”
demic expansion process, whereby subgroups leaving their parental colonies to establish new settlements at greater
distances from the cradle of humankind carried with them only a portion of the overall diversity of their parental
colonies.
7
The …ndings of Michalopoulos (2012) are consistent with the notion that heterogeneity in geographical factors
hindered mobility among groups and gave rise to nontransferable location-speci…c human capital, thereby promoting
the cultural drift of spatially segregated groups over time.

capital, the analysis additionally controls for the percentage of arable land, distance to waterways,
total land area, average monthly temperature and precipitation, the percentage of total land area in
Köppen-Geiger tropical and subtropical climate zones, disease richness, and island and landlocked
…xed e¤ects.
In addition, the empirical analysis considers three historical forces that may have in‡uenced
ethnic diversity. First, the advent of sedentary agriculture may have contributed to both ethnic
…ssions and fusions. While the increase in social strati…cation spurred by the Neolithic Revolution
may have catalyzed group formation, the rise of institutionalized statehood may have served to
homogenize ethnic identities. Second, to the extent that new peripheral groups could have emerged
over time, re‡ecting the ine¢ cient provision of public goods from core groups, the duration of human
settlement in a given location since prehistoric times could have contributed to ethnic diversity
(Ahlerup and Olsson, 2012). Third, the distribution of contemporary ethnolinguistic diversity across
countries partly re‡ects the legacy of colonialism, via the divide-and-rule strategies enacted by
colonial powers, the imposition of colonial institutions designed to achieve stronger political in‡uence
by assimilating groups into larger units, and major cross-continental migrations associated with the
colonial period. Hence, the analysis controls for the time elapsed since the Neolithic Revolution, the
duration of human settlement since prehistory, and the duration of experience as a colony.
Finally, a complete set of continental …xed e¤ects is included to account for the possibility
that unobserved continent-speci…c geographical and historical characteristics may have codetermined
the global distributions of genetic and ethnolinguistic diversity.

Estimation Results

The empirical results establish that genetic diversity is a fundamental determinant of ethnic and
cultural fragmentation, as re‡ected by various forms of ethnolinguistic heterogeneity. Exploiting
variations in a sample of 143 countries for which data on all employed variables are available, Column
1 of Table 1 presents the results from an OLS regression of the log number of ethnic groups on genetic
diversity and the full set of geographical and historical controls. As depicted in panel (a) of Figure
1, genetic diversity has a highly statistically signi…cant positive relationship with the log number
of ethnic groups. In particular, a 10 percentage point increase in genetic diversity is associated
with 1 additional ethnic group, relative to a baseline of 5.25 groups in the representative national
population.8 Further, the partial R2 associated with genetic diversity indicates that the residual
variation in diversity explains 7 percent of the residual variation in the log number of ethnic groups.
Regarding the geographical covariates, consistent with Michalopoulos (2012), variation in
land quality has a statistically signi…cant positive relationship with ethnic diversity. In contrast,
distance from the equator does not appear to be systematically related to the number of ethnic
groups. The entire set of controls for geographical variability explain 4 percent of the residual
variation in the log number of groups.
8
A 10 percentage point increase in genetic diversity can be interpreted as a 0.1 increase in the probability that
two randomly-selected individuals in a population are genetically di¤erent from one another with respect to a given
spectrum of traits.

migratory distance from East Africa. All regressions include controls for the percentage of arable land, distance to waterways, total land area, temperature, precipitation,
the percentage of land in tropical and subtropical climate zones, disease richness, and island, landlocked, and continental …xed e¤ects. See the Appendix for variable

Table 1: Genetic Diversity and Various Measures of Ethnolinguistic Heterogeneity

As for the historical controls, the negative (albeit insigni…cant) coe¢ cient on the time elapsed
since the Neolithic transition is consistent with a homogenizing role of early institutionalized statehood, while the positive (but insigni…cant) coe¢ cient on the duration of colonial experience accords
with divide-and-rule strategies enacted by colonialists on native populations. Moreover, the signi…cant positive coe¢ cient on the duration of human settlement is consistent with the notion that ethnic
…ssions emerge over time. These three historical forces together explain 6 percent of the residual
variation in the log number of groups.
Reassuringly, the estimated impact of genetic diversity on the number of ethnic groups is
stronger when one accounts for the potentially confounding role of mass migrations from the Old
World to the New World over the last 500 years. In particular, as depicted in panel (b) of Figure
1, if the regression from Column 1 is performed on a subsample comprised exclusively of countries
in the Old World, both the coe¢ cient and the partial R2 associated with genetic diversity become
quantitatively larger, consistent with the hypothesis that genetic diversity primarily contributed to
more ancient indigenous intergroup cleavages.
To further address the potential endogeneity between genetic and ethnic diversity due to
globalization in the last half millennium, Column 2 estimates a 2SLS variant of the speci…cation from
Column 1, with genetic diversity instrumented by migratory distance from East Africa. The results
indicate that the causal e¤ect of genetic diversity on the log number of ethnic groups is quantitatively
twice as strong as the OLS relationship from Column 1. Speci…cally, the 2SLS coe¢ cient on genetic
diversity implies that a 10 percentage point increase in genetic diversity increases the number of
ethnic groups in the population by 2.
The regressions in Columns 3 and 4 explore the explanatory power of exogenous variation in
genetic diversity for the observed variation in measures of ethnic fractionalization across countries,
based on Fearon (2003) and Alesina et al. (2003), respectively.9 Genetic diversity is found to have
a highly statistically signi…cant positive e¤ect on ethnic fractionalization. The estimate in Column
3 suggests that a 10 percentage point increase in genetic diversity increases the degree of ethnic
fractionalization by 8 percentage points.10
The next two columns investigate the in‡uence of instrumented genetic diversity on linguistic heterogeneity, as re‡ected by fractionalization (Column 5) and polarization (Column 6)
across linguistic groups within a country, categorized by Desmet, Ortuño-Ortín and Wacziarg (2012)
based on ancestral cleavages among contemporary spoken languages. Genetic diversity confers a
statistically signi…cant positive e¤ect on both measures, suggesting that it has indeed played a causal
role in generating culturally fragmented populations in the distant past.11 Finally, the regressions

Since the 2SLS method is superior (relative to focusing on a Old-World sample of countries) in terms of exploiting
global variations, it is employed as the identi…cation strategy in Columns 3–8. In addition, since endogeneity bias may
be more severe in these columns, given the functional dependence of fractionalization and polarization indices on the
distribution of the population across groups, the OLS estimates of the relationship with genetic diversity do not reveal
a robust systematic pattern in the global as opposed to the Old-World sample.
10
An 8 percentage point increase in ethnic fractionalization can be interpreted as a 0.08 increase in the probability
that two randomly-selected individuals in a population belong to di¤erent ethnic groups.
11
Ancestral linguistic cleavages are identi…ed by the branches that are closest to the roots of country-speci…c
hierarchical linguistic trees. More recent branches in such evolutionary trees, however, are overwhelmingly governed by
processes of cultural drift and cultural admixture. As such, linguistic groups categorized according to these recent splits
are less likely to re‡ect a prehistoric endogenous group formation process, where the initial domain of genetic diversity

Concluding Remarks

Despite the importance attributed to the role of diversity in the stability and prosperity of nations,
the origins of the uneven distribution of ethnic and cultural heterogeneity across countries have
been underexplored. This research establishes that genetic diversity is an underlying cause of a
broad spectrum of existing manifestations of ethnic and cultural fragmentation. Further exploration
of this largely uncharted territory may revolutionize the understanding of the process of economic
development and the persistent e¤ects that deeply-rooted factors have had on the composition of
human capital and economic development across the globe, fostering the design of policies aimed at
promoting growth and alleviating poverty.

may have played a fundamental role. Thus, genetic diversity and geographical variability do not possess signi…cant
explanatory power for measures of fractionalization and polarization across linguistic groups classi…ed using modern
language categories.

Variable De…nitions and Sources
Dependent Variables

Number of ethnic groups [EG]. The total number of distinct ethnic groups in a country’s
population, as compiled by Fearon (2003). The cross-country variable employed by the empirical
analysis is the natural logarithm of one plus the number of ethnic groups. See Fearon (2003) for
additional details on primary data sources and methodological assumptions.
Ethnic fractionalization [EF-F/EF-A]. The probability that 2 randomly-selected individuals in
a country’s population belong to di¤erent ethnic groups. Formally, the ethnic fractionalization index
for each country is calculated as:
F RAC = 1

n
X

p2i ,

i=1

where pi is the proportional representation of ethnic group i in the national population; and n is the
total number of ethnic groups comprising the country’s population. Data on ethnic groups (and their
proportional representations in the national population) by country are compiled independently by
Alesina et al. (2003) and Fearon (2003), thus yielding two separate (but correlated) cross-country
measures of ethnic fractionalization. See Alesina et al. (2003) and Fearon (2003) for additional details
on primary data sources and methodological assumptions.
Ethnolinguistic fractionalization, level-1 aggregation [ELF-D]. An index of fractionalization,
constructed by Desmet, Ortuño-Ortín and Wacziarg (2012), across the ancestral categories of the
modern linguistic groups in a country’s population. The ancestral linguistic divisions in a country’s
population correspond to the branches that are closest to the “root” of the country-speci…c phylogenetic linguistic tree. To compute the fractionalization index, the proportional representations (in
the national population) of the modern linguistic groups are …rst aggregated up into di¤erent bins,
each corresponding to one of these proto-language branches of the linguistic tree. For each country,
the index is then calculated across these bins (or ancestral linguistic groups) by applying the same
equation as the one underlying the calculation of the ethnic fractionalization index. See Desmet,
Ortuño-Ortín and Wacziarg (2012) for additional details on primary data sources and methodological
assumptions.
Ethnolinguistic polarization, level-1 aggregation [POL-D]. An index of polarization, constructed by Desmet, Ortuño-Ortín and Wacziarg (2012), across the ancestral categories of the
modern linguistic groups in a country’s population. The ancestral linguistic divisions in a country’s population correspond to the branches that are closest to the “root” of the country-speci…c
phylogenetic linguistic tree. To compute the polarization index, the proportional representations (in
the national population) of the modern linguistic groups are …rst aggregated up into di¤erent bins,
each corresponding to one of these proto-language branches of the linguistic tree. For each country,
the index is then calculated across these bins (or ancestral linguistic groups) by applying the following

where pi is the proportional representation of ancestral linguistic group i; and n is the total number

on primary data sources and methodological assumptions.
Ethnolinguistic polarization, Esteban-Ray index [POL-ER]. An index of polarization, constructed by Esteban, Mayoral and Ray (2012), across the ethnic groups in a country’s population,
where ethnic groups by country are classi…ed according to Fearon (2003) and the de…nition of
polarization that is applied is the one due to Duclos, Esteban and Ray (2004) and Esteban and
Ray (2011) that incorporates intergroup distances. Formally, the polarization index for each country
is calculated as:
P OL =

i=1 j=1

where pi is the proportional representation of ethnic group i in the national population; n is the total
number of ethnic groups comprising the country’s population; and sij is the “degree of similarity”
between the languages spoken by ethnic groups i and j, given by the ratio of the number of common
branches (shared by the two languages) to the maximum possible number of branching steps (i.e.,
15) in the phylogenetic linguistic tree for all languages worldwide. See Esteban, Mayoral and Ray
(2012) for additional details on primary data sources and methodological assumptions.
Ethnolinguistic polarization, Reynal-Querol index [POL-RQ]. An index of polarization,
constructed by Esteban, Mayoral and Ray (2012), across the ethnic groups in a country’s population,
where ethnic groups by country are classi…ed according to Fearon (2003) and the de…nition of
polarization that is applied is the one due to Reynal-Querol (2002) and Montalvo and Reynal-Querol
(2005). See Esteban, Mayoral and Ray (2012) for additional details on primary data sources and
methodological assumptions.

Independent and Instrumental Variables

Migratory distance from East Africa. The great circle distance from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
to a country’s modern capital city along a land-restricted path forced through one or more of
…ve aforementioned intercontinental waypoints, including Cairo, Egypt; Istanbul, Turkey; Phnom
Penh, Cambodia; Anadyr, Russia; and Prince Rupert, Canada. Distances are calculated using the
Haversine formula and are measured in units of a thousand kilometers. The methodology underlying
the construction of this measure is adopted from Ramachandran et al. (2005). The geographical
coordinates of the waypoints are obtained from Ramachandran et al. (2005) and those of the modern
capital cities are obtained from the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) World Factbook online. See
Ashraf and Galor (2013) for additional details.
Genetic diversity. The expected heterozygosity (genetic diversity) of a country’s contemporary
national population, as developed by Ashraf and Galor (2013). This measure is based on migratory
9

distances from East Africa to the year 1500 locations of the ancestral populations of the country’s
component ethnic groups in 2000 and on the pairwise migratory distances among these ancestral
populations. The source countries of the ancestral populations are identi…ed from the World Migration Matrix, 1500–2000 (Putterman and Weil, 2010), and the modern capital cities of these countries
are used to compute the aforementioned migratory distances. The measure of genetic diversity is
then computed by applying (i) the coe¢ cients obtained from regressing expected heterozygosity on
migratory distance from East Africa at the ethnic group level, using a worldwide sample of 53 ethnic
groups comprising the Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel, compiled by the Human Genome
Diversity Project (HGDP) and the Centre d’Étude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH); (ii) the
coe¢ cients obtained from regressing pairwise genetic distance on pairwise migratory distance in a
sample of 1,378 HGDP-CEPH ethnic group pairs, and (iii) the ancestry weights representing the
fractions of the year 2000 national population (i.e., of the country for which the measure is being
computed) that can trace their ancestral origins to di¤erent source countries in the year 1500. The
ethnic group (and group-pair) level data on expected heterozygosities, geographical coordinates, and
pairwise genetic distances are obtained from Ramachandran et al. (2005), and the country level data
on ancestry weights are obtained from the World Migration Matrix, 1500–2000 website. See Ashraf
and Galor (2013) for a detailed discussion of the methodology underlying the construction of this
measure.
Years since Neolithic. The number of thousand years elapsed (as of the year 2000) since the
majority of the population residing within a country’s modern national borders began practicing
sedentary agriculture as the primary mode of subsistence. This measure, reported by Putterman
(2008), is compiled using a wide variety of both region- and country-speci…c archaeological studies as
well as more general encyclopedic works on the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture
during the Neolithic Revolution. See the Agricultural Transition Data Set website for additional
details on primary data sources and methodological assumptions.
Settlement duration. The maximum duration, in tens of thousands of years, of uninterrupted
settlement by anatomically modern humans across locations within a country’s modern national
borders, as reported by Ahlerup and Olsson (2012). See Ahlerup and Olsson (2012) for additional
details on primary data sources and methodological assumptions.
Duration as colony. The duration, in centuries, of experience by a country (or any subregion
thereof) as a colony of one or more colonial powers, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain,
Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the United States. In cases where di¤erent regions within a country’s modern national borders were simultaneously colonized by di¤erent
colonial powers, the durations of experience as a colony is aggregated across these regions. This
variable is constructed by the authors of the current paper, based on colonization and decolonization
dates obtained from a wide range of online resources, including (but not limited to) the CIA’s World
Factbook, the Encyclopaedia Brittanica, and Country Studies of the Library of Congress. Additional
details on primary data sources and methodological assumptions are available from the authors upon
request.

Absolute latitude. The absolute value of the latitude of a country’s geodesic centroid, as reported
on the Gothos website, based on online metadata from (i) the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency’s (NGA) GEOnet Names Server (GNS) and (ii) the United States Geological Survey’s
(USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).
Mean land quality. A geospatial index of the suitability of land for agriculture, based on ecological
indicators of climate suitability for cultivation, such as growing degree days and the ratio of actual to
potential evapotranspiration, as well as on ecological indicators of soil suitability for cultivation, such
as soil carbon density and soil pH. This index was initially developed at a half-degree resolution by
Ramankutty et al. (2002), and it has been aggregated up to the country level by Michalopoulos (2012),
by averaging values across the grid cells that are located within a country’s national borders. The
variable employed by the current analysis is thus the aggregate measure reported by Michalopoulos
(2012). See Michalopoulos (2012) for additional details.
Variation in land quality. The standard deviation of the agricultural suitability index (as discussed
above) across the grid cells (at a half-degree resolution) that are located within a country’s national
borders, as reported by Michalopoulos (2012). See Michalopoulos (2012) for additional details.
Mean elevation. The average elevation of a country, in thousands of kilometers above sea level,
calculated using geospatial data at a 1-degree resolution from the Geographically based Economic
data (G-ECON) project (Nordhaus, 2006), which is, in turn, based on similar data at a 10-minute
resolution from New et al. (2002). The measure is aggregated up to the country level by averaging
across the grid cells that are located within a country’s national borders. See the G-ECON project
website for additional details.
Variation in elevation. The standard deviation of elevation (as discussed above) across the grid
cells (at a 1-degree resolution) that are located within a country’s national borders. See the G-ECON
project website for additional details.
Dispersion in elevation. The di¤erence between the maximum and minimum values of elevation
(as discussed above) across the grid cells (at a 1-degree resolution) that are located within a country’s
national borders. See the G-ECON project website for additional details.
Percentage of arable land. The fraction of a country’s total land area that is arable, as reported
for the year 2000 by the World Bank’s World Development Indicators online.
Distance to waterways. The distance, in thousands of kilometers, from a geospatial grid cell to
the nearest ice-free coastline or sea-navigable river, averaged across the grid cells that are located
within a country’s national borders. This variable, developed by Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1999),
is available from the online Research Datasets repository maintained by Harvard University’s Center
for International Development.
Total land area. The total land area of a country, in millions of square kilometers, as reported for
the year 2000 by the World Bank’s World Development Indicators online.
Temperature. The average monthly temperature of a country, in units of ten degrees Celsius
per month, over the 1961–1990 time period, calculated using geospatial data on average monthly
11

temperature for this period at a 1-degree resolution from the G-ECON project (Nordhaus, 2006),
which is, in turn, based on similar data at a 10-minute resolution from New et al. (2002). The
measure is aggregated up to the country level by averaging across the grid cells that are located
within a country’s national borders. See the G-ECON project website for additional details.
Precipitation. The average monthly precipitation of a country, in units of ten millimeters per
month, over the 1961–1990 time period, calculated using geospatial data on average monthly precipitation for this period at a 1-degree resolution from the G-ECON project (Nordhaus, 2006), which
is, in turn, based on similar data at a 10-minute resolution from New et al. (2002). The measure
is aggregated up to the country level by averaging across the grid cells that are located within a
country’s national borders. See the G-ECON project website for additional details.
Percentage of land in tropical and subtropical climate zones. The fraction of a country’s
total land area that is located in regions classi…ed as tropical or subtropical by the Köppen-Geiger
climate classi…cation system. This variable, developed by Gallup, Sachs and Mellinger (1999), is
available from the online Research Datasets repository maintained by Harvard University’s Center
for International Development.
Disease richness. The total number of di¤erent types of infectious diseases in a country, as reported
by Fincher and Thornhill (2008), based on the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network
(GIDEON) online database. See Fincher and Thornhill (2008) for additional details.
Island nation dummy. An indicator for whether or not a country shares a land border with any
other country, as reported by the CIA’s World Factbook online.
Landlocked dummy. An indicator for whether or not a country is landlocked, as reported by the
CIA’s World Factbook online.

Genetic diversity

Observations
Adjusted R2

Notes: This table demonstrates, exploiting variations across countries in the Old World, the statistically signi…cant
positive relationships between genetic diversity (adjusted for post-1500 migrations) and various measures of
contemporary ethnolinguistic heterogeneity, conditional on geographical and historical covariates. All regressions
include controls for the percentage of arable land, distance to waterways, total land area, temperature, precipitation, the
percentage of land in tropical and subtropical climate zones, disease richness, and island, landlocked, and continental
…xed e¤ects. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. *** denotes statistical signi…cance
at the 1 percent level, ** at the 5 percent level, and * at the 10 percent level.
