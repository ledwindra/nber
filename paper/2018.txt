Optimal Monetary Policy in an Open Economy

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the optimal intertemporal tradeoff between

inflation and output in an open economy under perfect foresight. The
announcement of the optimal plan may, or may not, generate an initial

jump in the exchange rate. That depends upon the real adjustment
costs, which such unanticipated changes impose on the economy. In the
case that such jumps occur, the question of time consistency of the

optimal policy arises. A time consistent solution is obtained provided:

(1) the policy maker is not too myopic; (ii) the adjustment

costs associated with the jump in the exchange rate are of an appro-

priate form. The optimal monetary rule is derived and properties of
this rule, as well as the overall optimal adjustment of the economy
are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION
The tradeoff between unemployment and inflation has been a

dominant issue in macroeconomic policy for many years now. The question of the optimal choice has been investigated by a number of authors.
The earliest studies, conducted in the mid 1960's were purely static;

see, e.g., Lipsey (1965) and Brechling (1968). Subsequently, the
analysis was extended to a dynamic context, where the source of the
dynamics is inflationary expectations, which are assumed to follow
some gradual evolutionary process, such as an adaptive scheme; see,

e.g., Phelps (1967, 1974), Turnovsky (1981). These authors derive
an optimal path along which the inflation rate adjusts gradually towards
some steady state equilibrium, while the unemployment rate converges

slowly towards its natural rate level. More recently, Stemp and Turnovsky
(1984) have shown that if instead, inflationary expectations satisfy

perfect foresight, the economy can jump instantaneously to a zero rate

of inflation. However, there is a tradeoff between an initial once—and—
for—all jump in the price level and the subsequent gradual adjustment
of the unemployment rate towards its natural rate level.

In this paper we analyze the issue of the unemployment (or
equivalently output)—inflation tradeoff in an open economy in which

expectations satisfy perfect foresight)' For the model we analyze,
we find that even under this assumption, the optimal paths followed
by output and inflation generally involve the gradual adjustment of
both variables towards their respective steady state equilibria.
There is therefore a dynamic intertemporal tradeoff between them.
The nature of the tradeoff depends critically upon the parameters

—2--

characterizing the economy, as well as the preferences of the policy

maker. These include in particular the rate of time discount and the
costs associated with an initial real structural adjustment in the

economy, necessary to attain the optimal path. The implied optimal
monetary policy along this path can be described in terms of monetary

rules, which can be expressed in various equivalent ways. One particu—
larly convenient form specifies the level of the real money stock,
relative to its equilibrium, in terms of the deviation of the current

real exchange rate from its long—run equilibrium level. Rules of this
kind are similar to those which appear in the recent literature on
exchange market intervention; see, e.g., Boyer (1978), Cox (1980),
Turnovsky (1983), and the papers in Bhandari (1985).

An important, and widely discussed, aspect of optimal policy
determination under rational expectations concerns the question of the
time consistency of the optimal policy; see, e.g., Kydland and Prescott

(1977), Turnovsky and Brock (1980). This issue is addressed in our
analysis.-1 We show that, provided the policy maker is not too myopic,
the time consistency or otherwise of the opimal solutions depends crucIally upon the nature of the adjustment costs associated with unanticipated
changes in the exchange rate, resulting from a policy change.

2. A DYNAMIC MACRO MODEL OF A SMALL OPEN ECONOMY
Consider a small open economy operating under a regime of

perfectly flexible exchange rates. The economy is assumed to be
specialized in the production of a single (composite) commodity, part
of which is consumed domestically, the remainder of which is exported.

—3—

In exchange, the economy imports from abroad, taking the foreign currency

price of imports as given. We also assume that there exists a perfect
worldwide capital market with domestic and foreign securities being

regarded as perfect substitutes. For notational simplicity, the model
is expressed relative to a fixed steady state, so that all variables

can be interpreted in deviation form. It can therefore be summarized
as follows:

Y =

d1(E

— P) —

N — P =

I = E

,

d2(I

—

d1

0,

d2 > 0

(lb)

except at points where E jumps

(lc)

a1Y

(id)

+ (1 — 6)E

(le)

C =

where

Y =

real output, measured as a deviation from its
natural rate level,

P =

price

of domestic output, expressed in logarithms,

C = consumer price index, expressed in logarithms,

E = exchange rate (measured in terms of units of foreign
currency per unit of domestic currency), measured
in logarithms,
I =

nominal interest rate,

M = nominal money supply, expressed in logarithms.
This model will be immediately recognized as being a standard

Dornbusch (1976) model, so that our description can be brief. Equation

—4-.

(la) describes the

reduced

form for the domestic goods market, where

the demand for domestic output depends positively upon the relative
price of domestic to foreign goods (where for convenience the foreign
currency price of the latter are set to unity) and negatively upon the

real interest rate. Money market equilibrium is specified by (lb) and
is standard. Uncovered interest parity is described by (ic), where
again for notational convenience we have set the foreign nominal

interest rate to zero. Equation (id) defines the rate of price adjustment in the domestic economy in terms of a simple Phillips curve.
Finally, (le) describes the domestic CPI (which we assume to be relevant
to the policy maker's objective function, discussed below), to be a
weighted average of the price ot domestic good and the domesLic price

of the imported good. Note that the real interest rate in (la) and
the nominal money stock in (lb) are deflated by the price of domestic

output. Little is changed, apart from additional notational complications, if the deflator is in terms of the domestic CPI.

Equations (la)—(le) describe the basic dynamic structure of

the economy, which is seen to be extremely simple. In addition, we
should note that the model embodies the familiar features of the Dornbusch
model, namely sluggish goods prices, so that at any point of time P is
predetermined by the past, while the exchange rate is forward looking,
allowing it to undergo endogenous jumps as new information impinges

on the economy. The policy maker is assumed to control the economy by
appropriate choice of the nominal money stock. In addition, the announce-ment of a new (optimal) policy at the beginning of the planning horizon,

—5—

time 0 say, leads to an initial jump in the exchange rate, which also

plays an important role in determining the subsequent path of the
economy.

The most critical aspect of the model concerns the formula-

tion of the objective function. Specifically, we assume that the
policy maker's objective is to

Minimize

kIE(0) —

+ J IaY + (l_a)Ô21e_13tdt

(2)

This cost function has two components. The second is a standard
quadratic loss function. It asserts that a zero rate of inflation of
the CPI (i.e., a stable CPI), together with a full employment level

of output (Y = 0), are regarded as globally optimal. The policy maker
seeks to minimize the discounted intertemporal deviations about these
targets, over the planning horizon, which we take to be infinite.

The parameter a (0 < a < 1) reflects the relative importance attached

to inflation and output in the intertemuoral objective. As a increases,
the policy maker is concerned increasingly with unemployment (output);
as a decreases, the objective is weighted more heavily towards inflation.
The parameter 13, (0 <

13

<

c)

which measures the rate of time preference,

reflects the degree of myopia of the policy maker; the larger 13, the

more myopic he is.

As noted above, with a forward looking exchange rate, the
change in monetary policy at time zero will cause the exchange rate
to undergo an initial unanticipated discontinuous change from its pre-

viously inherited level E0 say, at that time. Given that the price of
output is predetermined at any instant, this change in the nominal

—6—

exchange rate translates into an instantaneous unanticipated jump in
the relative price E — P, which in turn causes an unanticipated jump

in output. These jumps in real magnitudes impose real (structural)
adjustment costs on the economy and these need to be taken into account
in assessing the overall benefits of the optimal stabilization policy
to the economy.

The initial adjustment costs are specified to be proportional
to the absolute value of the jump, raised to the arbitrary power q.--"

This is a more general functional form than the more usual quadratic
function appearing in the second component in (2), but the choice is

deliberate. As will be shown below, the time consistency or otherwise
of the optimal policy depends critically upon q. Specifically, if

q <

I,

the solution is time consistent; for q > 1 it is time incon-

sistent. Thus the quadratic function (q = 2) is time inconsistent,
while if the initial costs are evaluated in terms of the absolute jumps
(q =

1),

time consistency is obtained.

The magnitude of the initial jump in the exchange rate will be

shown to depend upon the size of the coefficient k. In the limiting
case when k = 0, we will see that the optimal monetary policy will move

the economy instantaneously to steady state. The dynamic time path therefore degenerates. Thus, a well—defined optimal intertemporal adjustment
path is obtained by, in effect, balancing off the initial costs associated
with implementing the policy, with the subsequent improvement in the

performance of the economy. This procedure for generating a gradual

adjustment process is not new. In his well known survey article on
distributed lags, Griliches (1967) demonstrated how distributed lag

— 7.—

investment functions could be derived by balancing off the costs of an
initial adjustment in the capital stock) with the costs of being away

from some target level. Our approach here is essentially analogous.

3. THE OPTIMAL MONETARY POLICY PROBLEM
The formal monetary stabilization problem is to choose the
nominal money stock M(t) so as to minimize the loss function specified

in (2) subject to the constraints on the economy given by (1). In order
to solve this problem it is convenient to define:

real

m E M — P =

S

money stock (in logarithms),

relative

E — P =

price of foreign to domestic
goods (in logarithms); i.e., the real
exchange rate.

We can then use equations (1) to express the variables Y, C, and s, in
terms of m and s as follows:

This imposes an upper

bound on the speed of price adjustment y consistent with having a down-

ward sloped IS curve in Y —

space.

Given the assumption that price of output moves gradually, it is

reasonable to assume that P(t) is observed at time t. Thus by continuously
accommodating the nominal money stock (the monetary instrument) to the predetermined price level, the monetary authorities can in effect control the
real money stock m. In fact, it is analytically convenient to treat m rather

than M as being the monetary control variable. Secondly, we assume that the
monetary authority observes the nominal exchange rate instantaneously. Thus
the relative price 8(t) is observable to the policy maker at time t, and in

factthe optimal monetary policies will be obtained as feedback solutions in
terms of s.-' Thus the formal optimal stabilization problem is

subject to (3a)—(3c).

s

Since the function describing the adjustment costs associated
with the initial jump in the real exchange rate, i.e., kjs(0) —
is generally nondifferentiable at the point s(0) =

s0, the optimization

problem specified by equations (3a)—(3c), (4) can most easily be solved
by decomposing it into the following two subproblems:

Problem 1:

Find L1 =

Mm

k(s(0) —

80)q + J [aY2 + (l_a)C!2Jetdt

subject to equations (3a)—(3c) and s(0) >

Problem 2:

Find L2 =

k(s0 —

5(0))q +

[aY2 + (l_a)2]etdt

J

subject to equations (3a)—(3c) and s0 >

(5b)

The solution to the original nroblem is then a solution for which
s(O) >

s

is L1 <

L

or a solution for which s0 >

s(O) if L2 < L1.

4. DETERMINATION OF OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS
To solve the optimization problem specified by both Problems
1 and 2, we first write down the Hamiltonian function:

H

+ (l—a)[1m + 2s]2]

et[a{1m +

+ e_t[ -

where let is the discounted Lagrange multiplier associated with the
dynamic equation (3c). The Euler equations with respect to m and s
are then given by

(7b)

p12s

+ l22S

—

where

acP + (l_a)nfl

i =

1,

2

i =

1,

2

These two equations, in conjunction with equations (3a)—(3c), then
define the dynamic time paths for the optimal solutions for m and s,
and hence for Y and C.

—10—

Note further that the long—run solution is obtained by setting
s = p

= 0 in (7a), (7b). From this substitution we immediately see that

in long—run equilibrium m = s = 0.

Consequently, the long—run dynamic

time path of the economy converges to Y = C = 0.
In addition, the optimal solution must satisfy the following
transversality condition as t

(8)

Furthermore, the fact that s(0) is endogenously determined imposes the
following constraints on the initial time point 0, see, e.g., Kamien
and Schwartz (1971):

5. TRANSITIONAL DYNANICS
The main item of interest is the transitional dynamics implied

by the optimal solutions (7a), (7b), together with (3a)—(3c). We begin
by solving (7a) for m, namely,

l2
(11)

Next, substituting for in from (11) into (7b) and (3c) the dynamic solution

reduces to the following pair of equations in

(l7b)

where

if h <

In other words, the optimal solution will have two unstable
roots if the policy maker is sufficiently myopic (i.e., 13 is sufficiently

large); otherwise, the optimal solution will have one stable and one
unstable root. The critical level of myopia, 13*, depends upon the
parameters in the economy.
The solution to the dynaiiic system (12) can be expressed in

where p(O) satisfies the initial conditions given by equations (9), (10)

It will be recalled from the previous discussion that if the

policy maker is sufficiently myopic (i.e., if
then 0 <

<

/2,

is sufficiently large)

and the path derived from the optimality conditions

is unstable. This is a plausible outcome, because when the policy maker
is myopic much more weight is assigned to initial values along the optimal

path. In the extreme case when

> *, the

policy maker is so unconcerned

with these later values that it is of little consequence for the loss function that the optimal path diverges.

When the optimal path diverges, then given that an optimal path
has been chosen at time 0, say, it will always be optimal to revise the
initial path at some future time t

to say. This property of the optimal

solution, which is known as time inconsistency, is clearly undesirable.

In fact it can be argued that if all solutions to the optimization problem
are time inconsistent, then no truly optimal solution will exist.-'

—14-

Throughout the rest of this paper we shall restrict analysis to the
case where the optimal path converges (i.e., A2 <

0).

As will be

shown in the next section, for a large range of cases, such a path

is consistent with a time—path that would be chosen at any time in
the future, and hence is time consistent.

Equations (19a), (19b) describe the time path of the real

exchange rate, s, and the costate variable, , along the optimal path
that will be followed after an initial jump in the exchange rate. Combining (l9b) with (11), and noting the definitions of h.., the real

money stock along the optimal path is related to the real exchange
rate by the simple feedback rule

m(t) =

t > 0

Rules of the form (20) characterize much of the current discussion of
exchange market intervention; see Boyer (1978), Cox (1980), Turnovsky

(1983) and papers in Bhandari (1985). Since 81 <

and assuming the

0, we see that the coefficient

(20) is positive. This means that following the initial jump

in the exchange rate, it will be optimal for the policy maker to respond
to a depreciating real exchange rate by increasing the real money supply;

i.e., to lean with the wind." Note that by using the definitions of m
and s, the rule can be expressed equivalently in nominal terms as

E(t) +

N(t) =

—15—

In a similar fashion we can express the optimal time paths
followed by output and inflation in terms of the time path followed by

the real exchange rate. These are derived by substituting (20) and
(19b) into (3a), (3b), respectively, to yield1

That is, along the optimal path

domestic output increases with the real exchange rate. On the other hand,

in (21b) is ambiguous. Differentiating (le) with respect to t and
noting the definition of s, we may express (21b) as

= P
=

+ (l—6)

[yw

+ (l—6)X2J

(21b')

enabling us to see the source of the ambiguity. On the one hand, C
responds positively through the inflation of domestic goods to domestic
output and hence to the relative price s; on the other hand, it is
negatively related through changes in S

to s. The net effect depends

upon which of these two effects dominate.
Combining equations (21a), (21b), we observe that the optimal
paths for output and the rate of inflation of the CPI lie along the
straight line

It is clear from the above observations that this locus may be either

0. Finally,

positively or negatively sloped depending upon whether

substituting (20) into (3c) and noting (2la), (21b), we see that along
the optimal path all variables converge at tne same rate

to their

respective steady states.

ENDOGENOUS INITIAL JUMPS IN EXCHANGE RATh
daving

determined the dynamic time path

ing the initial jump

of the economy follow-

in the exchange rate, all that

remains to determine

the solution for the optimal time path is to determine the initial condition for the exchange rate, namely, s(0), itself.
By combining the transversality conditions at time 0, given
by equations (9) and (10), together with the optimality conditions (l9a),
(1gb), and the comparison of the loss functions for Problems 1 and 2. we

find that the initial conditions for s(0) for the optimization problem
are given by

s(0) =

(23c)

The nature of the endogenous jumps in the exchange rate depends crucially
upon the form of the adjustment costs as represented in (2'). Specifically,
the time consistency of the initial jump depends upon the magnitude of q,

—17—

while the magnitude of the initial jump depends upon the inherited real
exchange rate s0, together with the cost parameter k.

It is convenient

to consider the three cases q = 1, 0 < q < 1, q > 1 separately.
Case 1:

q = 1

In this case conditions (23a)—(23c) reduce to

It can be deduced from these three equations that if the inherited real

exchange rate s lies in a specific closed interval bounded by

{hii_x2] <

s

<

(25)

then it will be optimal for no initial jump in the real exchange rate

s to occur.Z' Since any initial jump in the real exchange rate is
achieved through a jump in the nominal rate (P moves continuously throughout) this means that if (25) holds, it will be optimal for no jump in

the nominal exchange rate to occur. However, if s0 lies outside this
interval, then the nominal exchange rate will jump so that the real
exchange rate s moves instantaneously to the nearest boundary of this
closed interval.

—18—

The boundaries of the closed interval defined in (25) depend
critically upon k, the magnitude of the cost associated with the initial

then it is clear that it is never optimal to have an

jump. If k

initial jump in the exchange rate E. On the other hand, if k - 0, then
the closed interval (25) collapses to 0, and it will be optimal for the
real exchange rate to always jump instantaneously to its steady state

equilibrium value, (which we have chosen to be zero). Thirdly, the
boundaries of the closed interval are symmetric about the steady—state
equilibrium level

=

0.

Once the initial condition for the optimal time path for the
real exchange rate s has been determined, equations (19a), (19b) show
that s will then converge monotonically towards its steady state level,
whenever
=

is sufficiently small to ensure A2 < 0.

Since the steady state

0 is always within the boundaries of the closed interval defined by

(25), it will not be optimal for the exchange rate to jump again after

the initial jump. In the case q = 1, therefore, the optimal policy will
clearly be time consistent.

This example of a time consistent solution is illustrated in

Figure la. Initially, the real exchange rate is at s0 < —(h11—X2)k/h12.
At the initial instant that optimization begins, the jump in the nominal
exchange rate causes the real exchange rate to jump to s(O) =

and thereafter it begins to converge monotonically towards equilibrium
(zero).

Case 2: 0< q <1
En

this

case condition (23b) reduces to
= s(O)

<

(23b')

—19—

Thus if s0 < 0, then either s(0) satisfies (23a) or s(0) =

As in

the case q = 1, it may be optimal either for an initial jump in s to

occur, or for no initial jump in s to occur, depending upon the
inherited value of the exchange rate, as well as the adjustment cost

parameters k and q, and other parameters in the economy. Note that
in contrast to the case q = 1, where the point to which s(0) jumps
(when it is in fact optimal to jump) is independent of the inherited
value s0 (see (24a) or (24b)), in the present case s(0) is in part

determined by s0; see (23a), (23b). It can further be shown that no
subsequent jumps beyond the initial point will be optimal, although

details of this are omitted.' Thus for 0 < q

be time consistent and the optimal patti will be of the same general

form to that for q = 1; i.e., a possible initial jump followed by convergence towards equilibrium.

Hence s(O+)

Thus, when q > 1, the recomputed

path is in general discontinuous and the optimal solution is in general
time inconsistent.

An example of this time inconsistent case is given in Figure

lb. At the beginning of the optimization period, the real exchange rate

s jumps from s to s(0). If the policy maker reoptimizes at time to,
then it will be optimal for the exchange rate to jump again at that time.
An intuitive explanation of these results can be seen by noting
that the marginal cost of a jump in the exchange rate is given by

kqs(O) When 0

< q <

q—l

1, the marginal cost of a jump decreases with the magnitude

of the jump. Thus it is "cheaper" to have one large jump than two small

ones. On the other hand, when q > 1, the marginal cost of a jump
increases with the magnitude of the jump. In this case two smaller jumps

are less costly than a single large one'

7. SOLUTION FOR OPTIMAL TIME PATH
We are now in a position to construct the optimal time paths

for output and inflation. This involves a consideration of the optimal
transitional paths given in (19a,l9b), (20), and (2la,2lb), as well as
the endogenous initial jumps in the exchange rate described in Section 6.
Throughout this section we shall restrict discussion to time consistent

solutions. We shall also consider the case q =

1,

for which s(O) when

it jumps, does so to a point independent of s0. The case q < 1 is essentially similar, the only difference being that s(O) is a function of s0,
as seen from (23a).

—21—

We assume that initially the economy starts from a point hav-

ing an arbitrary real money stock m0 and real exchange rate s0. Corresponding to these values, (3a), (3b) imply initial values of output and
inflation, namely,
=

C0 =

+

2O

flm + fl2S0

For the sake of being concrete we shall assume that m0, s0, the inherited

values, have been chosen such that

< 0, C0 > 0; i.e., the economy

begins in a state of stagflation.

Typical optimal paths for inflation and output are illustrated

in Figures 2A, 2B. In both these figures, the locus XX' defines the
optimal adjustment path for output and CPI inflation described by equa-

tion (22). It has been drawn on the assumption that the domestic price
inflation responds slowly to output changes (i.e., y is small), so that
the coefficient

in (2lb) is negative. This implies that XX' has a

negative slope. Given our choice of units, the steady state of the
economy is at the point where this line passes through the origin.
The appropriate initial points on the line XX' lie within

the closed interval defined by AB. In effect, this locus is the analogue
of the closed set derived from (23b) in Y—C space. Within this set no
initial jump in E (or s) occurs. If the economy starts outside this set
it must move towards the nearer endpoint A or B. The coordinates of
these points are obtained by substituting for (0) from the initial
conditions (9), (10) into (19) and (21), at time t = 0.

—22—

The loci Z1Z, Z2Z (as well as WS,

W'S') have

slopes given

by

dC

where the partial derivatives ,

(27)

=

n,

are obtained from (3a), (3b)

Basically, these derivatives define the slopes of the lines along
which inflation and output will move instantaneously in response to
an initial change in the money supply, without taking account of the
jump in E which such a change may or may not induce (depending upon

adjustment costs). Since l > 0, its slope depends upon whether

It is seen from its definition that r, has two effects. On
4-

the

one hand, an increase in m will raise output, thereby increasing

the rate of inflation of domestic goods and hence that of the overall

CPI. On the other hands the monetary expansion will tend to lower the
domestic interest rate and hence the rate of exchange depreciation,

thereby lowering the rate of inflation of the CPI. We take the case

where the latter effect dominates, so that the Z.Z lines are negatively

sloped.

Figure 2 illustrates two cases. The first is where the initial
output and inflation rate lie at a point such as V which lies outside

the area defined by Z1Z and Z2Z. The second is where it is initially
at W, which lies within the area. We shall consider these in turn.
Suppose that the economy is initially at V, with
positive rate of inflation C0 > 0.

and a

The initial adjustment involves mov-

ing the system instantaneously to A on the optimal locus XX'. This jump
implies an instantaneous increase in real output (dY(O) >

0),

accompanied

—23—

by an instantaneous reduction in the rate of inflation (d(O) <

0).

To

see the adjustments involved, we consider equations (3a), (3b). Letting

dY(0) =

(29b)

Thus the movement from V to A is achieved by an initial monetary
expansion. This gives rise to a depreciation .of the real exchange rate,

which with the price of domestic output sluggish, is brought about by a

—24—

depreciation of the nominal rate. The expressions for the initial changes
in s(0) and m(0) are obtained from (24) and (20), namely,

Consequently, the original stagflation illustrated by V is the result of
a low real money supply, coupled with a value of the real exchange rate
which is overvalued compared with its long-run equilibrium value.
In Figure 2A we have also drawn the locus VV', the slope of
which is

(31)

[c] VV,

This represents the relative effects of an exchange rate change on the
rate of inflation and level of output, with the nominal (and real) money

supply held constant. Thus the instantaneous jump from V to A can be
decomposed into a jump due to the change in the exchange rate (along VI!'),

coupled with a jump due to the monetary expansion (along V'A), both of
which occur simultaneously at the beginning of the optimization.

Letting (dC/dY), denote the slope of the inflation—output
tradeoff given by XX', we can show by substitution that

Figures 2A and 2B are drawn with the respective slopes

satisfying (32).

Despite the initial depreciation of the exchange rate associated
with the move from V to A, the domestic currency remains overvalued rela-

tive to its long—run equilibrium. Further devaluation is required. With
s(0) <

0,

the monetary authorities set m(0) < 0, in accordance with the

optimal rule (20). As a result, the domestic exchange rate
continues to depreciate; i.e., s(0) =

to continue increasing and with

A2s(0)

immediately

This causes output

for CPI inflation to continue

decreasing. Along the optimal path, the real exchange s continues to
depreciate, although at a decreasing rate, as steady state is approached.

This adjustment is mirrored by the

money supply. Likewise, output and

inflation continue to follow the optimal path XX' until the stedy—stae
equilibrium Y = C = 0 is reached.
It is also possible to consider the case where the domestic
price inflation effect in (2lbT) dominates, so that the coefficient
>

0.

In this case XX' is positively sloped. The exposition remains

similar to the above except that after the jump in the exchange rate,
the economy will be driven to a level of deflation (C(0) <

unemployment. In this case the effect of the

0),

as well as

monetary expansion along the

optimal path on output will have a greater effect on domestic prices than

before. The added demand now induces inflationary pressure leading to a
gradual moderation in the deflation initially generated.
We turn now to the second case illustrated in

Figure 2b, where

the economy starts out at W which lies within the area bounded by Z1Z

and Z2Z. In this case it will be optimal for no initial jump in the
exchange rate to occur and the optimal path will be reached by means of

an initial expansion in the money supply alone. In this case the move

—26—
is along WS which involves an increase in output accompanied by a

decrease in inflation. Thereafter, output and inflation follow XXV

as before. Note that it is possible for the increase in output resulting from the initial monetary expansion to take the economy beyond the

steady state level 0. In this case, the economy will reduce output and
depending upon the magnitude of w2, inf late or deflate along the optimal

path XX'. This is illustrated by the move along W'S' from the initial
point W' in Figure 2b.

Finally, Figure 3 illustrates the implied time paths for the
levels of CPI and output (drawn for w2 <

0).

The relationship between

these paths and those in Figure 2 is self—explanatory.

8. FURTHER DISCUSSION
In this paper we have analyzed the optimal intertemporal tradeoff between inflation and output in an open economy which is characterized

by perfect foresight in the formation of exchange rate expectations. The
announcement of the optimal plan, may or may not, generate an initial

unanticipated jump in the exchange rate. That depends upon the real
adjustment costs, which such unanticipated changes impose on the economy.
In the case that such jumps do occur, the question of time consistency

of the optimal path arises. e have obtained a time consistent solution,
provided: (i) the policy maker is not too myopic; (ii) the adjustment
costs associated with the unanticipated jump in the exchange rate are of
an appropriate, but reasonable, form.

The optimal monetary rule can be expressed in feedback form
with the real money supply being adjusted to the real exchange rate.
In most cases the relationship is a positive one, implying a "leaning

with the wind" policy. The corresponding adjustments in output and

—2.7—

inflation can also be expressed in terms of the real exchange rate.
Accordingly, along the optimal path the relationship between output

and inflation is a linear one. This may be either positively or
negatively sloped, depending upon whether the CPI inflation rate is
positively or' negatively related to the real exchange rate.
ve

have analyzed in some detail the case where the
economy

starts from stagflation; output is below full employment equilibrium,

while the inflation rate is positive. In the case that it is optimal
for the exchange rate to undergo an initial jump, the optimal monetary
policy calls for an initial expansion, thereby generating an initial
increase in output and in the level of the CPI, followed by an instantaneous

reduction in its rate of inflation. Thereafter, as the economy moves
along the optimal paui, the monetary growth remains positive, but declin-.
ing, so that output and inflation converge to their respective equilibria.
If the costs associated with the initial jump in the exchange rate are
sufficiently high, there will be no initial jump, and the optimal output—
inflation tradeoff path is reached by means of a change in the money

supply alone. The exchange rate then always moves continuously.
An important aspect of our analysis concerns the specification of
the Phillips curve, (ld), in which the price of output adjusts to devia-

tions in output alone. If, on the other hand, the price adjusts fully to
changes in the CPI, as the result of some wage indexation scheme, say,
our results are changed somewhat. In particular, the stable loci XX'
in Figs 2A, 2B become horizontal, coinciding with the Y axis, implying
that inflation can be reduced instantaneously to zero. At the same
time, output still adjusts slowly, reflecting the initial adjustment
12/
costs.—

—28—

A further interesting aspect of our results is the ability to
generate time—consistent solutions.

These are obtained by imposing

costs on the initial jumps in the exchange rate and assuming these to

be from a specified class of functions. Such costs are introduced on
the grounds that unanticipated changes in the exchange rateimpose
real disturbances and hence real adjustment costs on the economy.
The feature of the specification which generates time consistency is
the fact that the marginal cost of a jump in the exchange rate
decreases with the size of the jump, thus making it optimal to make

an initial large jump and discouraging any subsequent jumps. By
choosing a general class of adjustment cost functions, we have
demonstrated that the phenomenon of time consistency is not simply
the result of choosing a particular arbitrary cost function.

Furthermore, the procedure used here has general applicability
and may prove to be useful in other stabilization contexts.

In fact, one can show that an increase in m alone will (in the
absence of adjustment costs) lead to a devaluation of the exchange
rate.
This devaluation in the exchange rate tends to increase the
domestic inflation rate P, but as is known from the Dornbusch model,
this can lead to a decline in E, the rate of depreciation of the
nominal exchange rate. Since C = 3P + (l—ô)E, the overall effect
on the CPI inflation rate is in general ambiguous.
