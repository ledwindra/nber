Adjusting Government Policies for Age Inflation

ABSTRACT
Government policies that are based on age do not adjust to the fact that a given age is associated with
a higher remaining life expectancy and lower mortality risk relative to earlier time periods due to improvements
in mortality. We examine four possible methods for adjusting the eligibility ages for Social Security,
Medicare, and Individual Retirement Accounts to determine what eligibility ages would be today and
in 2050 if adjustments for mortality improvement were taken into account. We find that historical
adjustment of eligibility ages for age inflation would have increased ages of eligibility by approximately
0.15 years annually. Failure to adjust for mortality improvement implies the percent of the population
eligible to receive full Social Security benefits and Medicare will increase substantially relative to
the share eligible under a policy of age adjustment.

Adjusting Government Policies for Age Inflation
John B. Shoven and Gopi Shah Goda

It is commonly agreed upon that government programs such as tax systems, welfare
programs, and retirement programs must adjust for price inflation to account for the fact that a
fixed amount of dollars can buy items of different values from one time period to the next. Few
would argue that a $10,000 income in 1970 is the same in real terms as a $10,000 income in
2008, and most government programs explicitly take this difference into account. In fact, the
year-to-year adjustments that are needed to keep systems in line with their initial intentions are
often automatic. When comparing U.S. economic statistics for different time periods,
economists and policy analysts state the figures in “real dollars” or “dollars of constant
purchasing power” rather than using unadjusted nominal dollars. Just like a dollar in 1950 is not
the same unit as a dollar in 2008, we argue that a year of age or a year since birth is not a
constant unit of age. We will propose different ways of coming up with “real ages” rather than
nominal years since birth and then illustrate how various ages in the law would have to be
adjusted in order to maintain constant real ages.
A particular age, as conventionally measured by years since birth, has a different “value”
or meaning associated with it over time. We call this effect “age inflation.” The typical 65year-old in 1935, when Social Security was enacted, had a much higher mortality risk and lower
life expectancy than the typical 65-year-old in 2004 (see Figure 1). In 1935, 65-year-olds could
expect to live just over 12 additional years on a gender-blended basis, while a 65-year-old in
2004 could expect an additional 19 years of life. Their mortality risk, or their chance of dying
within a year, was over 3 percent in 1935, but less than 1.5 percent in 2004. In addition, 65

2

represents two very different stages in the life cycle for these individuals, as measured by the
percent of the life expectancy completed. Figure 2 shows the percent of the life expectancy
completed by age 65, where life expectancy is measured at birth and at age 20, again on a
gender-blended basis. In 1935, age 65 was greater than the life expectancy of a newborn, and
represented roughly 95 percent of the life expectancy of a 20-year-old. By 2004, both of these
percentages had fallen to approximately 85 percent. Figure 3 displays the percent of the
population age 65 and older from 1940 through 2004. In 1940, 7 percent of the population was
age 65 or older, so a 65-year-old individual was in the 93rd percentile of the age distribution. In
2004, a 65-year-old was instead in the 88th percentile because the number of people living age 65
and beyond has grown significantly relative to the younger population. The U.S. Census
forecasts that a 65-year old will be in the 78th or 79th percentile of the population by 2050.
Despite these large changes in what it means to be age 65, there has been almost no
adjustment in the Social Security program to account for these differences. If we think of
individuals with a higher life expectancy and lower mortality rate as effectively “younger,”
absent adjustments to Social Security rules, participants are allowed to commence a Social
Security life annuity at younger and younger real ages.
In this paper, we examine the rules governing three public programs – Social Security,
Medicare, and Individual Retirement Accounts – and determine what the ages in the legislation
would be today if we assume that the initial ages when the legislation was enacted defined the
original intent of each program in terms of real ages. We also project the level of these legislated
ages to 2050 under two different scenarios: 1) automatic age adjustments began when the law
was enacted, and 2) automatic age adjustments begin now.

3

Four different methods are used to make adjustments for age inflation. The first method
adjusts an age from year X to year Y by finding the age in Y with an equivalent remaining life
expectancy. The second method is similar, but finds the age in Y that faces the same mortality
risk. In the third method, the adjusted age in Y represents the same percentage point in the life
expectancy as the original age in Y, where life expectancy is measured at birth. The fourth
method is similar, but measures the lifespan as the total life expectancy given survival to age 20.
Each of these methods is applied to the whole population, as well as to different demographic
groups to examine whether there have been differential rates of mortality improvement across
race and gender.
This paper builds on earlier work in Shoven (2007) which discusses alternative ways of
measuring age. Shoven shows that there has been remarkable progress in age-specific mortality,
and that as measured by mortality risk, a 59-year-old man in 1970 was the same real age as a 65year-old man in 2000. The mortality improvement among women was somewhat slower over
the last thirty years of the Twentieth Century, but still significant: a 59-year-old woman in 1970
had the same mortality risk as a 63-year-old woman in 2000. He also shows that the
measurement of the elderly as a percent of the U.S. population differs based on whether
conventional measures of age are used or a definition of age based on mortality risk.
Other literature which has presented similar ideas include Fuchs (1984), Cutler and
Sheiner (2001), Shoven (2004), Sanderson and Scherbov(2005 and 2007), Cutler, Liebman and
Smyth (2006), and Lutz, Sanderson and Scherbov(2008). Fuchs states that remaining life
expectancy may be a better measure of age and suggested that “nominal ages” could (or should)
be adjusted to “real ages” based on mortality or remaining life expectancy. Cutler and Sheiner
note that for acute care and nursing home care, demand is more a function of remaining life

4

expectancy than it is of age. They find that the high medical costs associated with the last year
of life have been occurring at older and older ages. Similarly, Shoven (2004) finds that Medicare
spends roughly the same amount on men and women with the same mortality risk or remaining
life expectancy. Sanderson and Scherbov(2005, 2007) and Lutz, Sanderson and Scherbov(2008)
show how forward looking measures of age (such as remaining life expectancy) in combination
with traditional backwards looking meaures (years since birth) can lead to a better understanding
of global population aging. Cutler, Liebman and Smyth (2006) model the optimal Social
Security retirement age in light of changes in the underlying health of the population. They
summarize several measures of health status over time, such as self-reported health status, annual
bed days for people with specific health conditions, and disability rates. Across these different
measures, it is evident that the health status of individuals of a given age has improved
significantly over time.

The Relationship between Age, Remaining Life Expectancy, and Mortality Risk
Over time, there has been significant mortality improvement that is persistent across age,
gender, and race. There is a wide variety of statistics that illustrate this point, and we present
some of them here. There are two other interesting empirical facts to highlight that will show up
in our later analysis. The first is that while women have always experienced higher life
expectancies than men of the same age and continue to do so, the mortality improvement among
women over the last 30 years has been lower than that among men. In addition, holding life
expectancy constant through time, individuals have a lower mortality risk today than they had
decades ago.

5

Figures 4 and 5 display mortality risk by age in 1940, 1970, and 2004, for men and
women respectively. In moving to each successive time period, the curves shift down and to the
right by an amount that represents the degree of mortality improvement. Individuals at each age
face a lower chance of dying within a year in 1970 and 2004 compared to 1940. If we placed
Figures 3 and 4 on top of each other, we would see that women at each age face lower mortality
risk than men. The degree of mortality improvement also differed by gender in the two periods.
Women saw greater improvement in mortality from 1940 to 1970, while men experienced
greater improvement 1970 to 2004. The mortality risk progress over the entire 64-year period is
roughly the same for men and women and nothing short of remarkable. The magnitude of the
change can be illustrated by noting that the mortality risk of both 70-year old men and women in
2004 is very close to the mortality of 60-year old men and women in 1940. The saying “70 is the
new 60” is not just a cute phrase on a birthday card. It’s true! – at least in terms of mortality risk.
Remaining life expectancy and mortality risk are two alternative mortality-related
measures of age. Remaining life expectancy at a given age takes into account the mortality risk
in that age as well as the mortality risk in successive years, while the mortality risk measure is
limited to the chance of death within one year. If a person’s chance of dying was zero in one
year and one hundred percent the next, this individual would look very young by the mortality
risk measure, but older by the remaining life expectancy measure. The data show that the
relationship between these two measures over time is that individuals with a given life
expectancy face a lower chance of dying in the next year now relative to what they used to. For
instance, men with a 18-year remaining life expectancy in 1935 had a 1.9% mortality risk,
whereas such a man in 2004 had approximately a 1.5% mortality risk. This suggests that even

6

with the same remaining life expectancy, people are “healthier” in 2004 than in 1935. This
phenomenon is consistent with a larger concentration of high mortality in the last years of life.

Ages Fixed in Government Policies
We focus on three public programs primarily for the elderly: Social Security retirement
benefits, Medicare, and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Social Security defines the
rules under which beneficiaries are eligible to receive full retirement benefits (commonly
referred to as the Normal Retirement Age, or NRA), a reduced level of benefits (Early
Retirement Age, or ERA), and the age at which benefits stop increasing with later retirement due
to delayed retirement credits. Medicare defines the age at which beneficiaries are first eligible to
receive health insurance benefits. The rules governing IRAs (and 401(k)s, 403(b)s and 457
plans) indicate the age at which funds can be withdrawn without penalty, and the age at which a
minimum distribution must be taken to avoid penalty.
Social Security began with the Social Security Act of 1935. The program originally was
designed to give retirement benefits to those over the age of 65, with no provision for reduced
benefits at earlier ages or higher benefits for delayed retirement. In 1956, all female workers and
widows were eligible for reduced benefits at age 62, and in 1961, the option of reduced benefits
at 62 was extended to men.1 The next changes came in 1972 when delayed retirement credits
were instituted for those who retired after age 65, and these accrued until an individual reached
age 72. The 1983 amendments lowered this maximum age to 70, and most significantly,
increased the normal retirement age for the first time in the program’s history gradually to age
67. (SSA Title II) The increase in the NRA will be completed by 2023 and was motivated by

1

Widows later became eligible for reduced benefits at age 60 in 1965, but here we focus on retirement benefits.

7

the program’s financial difficulties rather than an explicit recognition that age inflation meant
that 65 was not the same real age that it had been in 1935.
Medicare’s age of eligibility has been 65 since the program was enacted in 1965 (SSA
Title XVIII). Similarly, the age limits for IRAs and other defined contribution retirement plans
have not changed since they were created by ERISA legislation in 1974. The earliest age at
which funds can be withdrawn without penalty is 59 ½ and the age where the minimum required
withdrawals are imposed is 70 ½.

Data Sources
Several data sources were obtained to determine the adjustment of government program
rules for age inflation. The primary source of mortality data is the set of period life tables used
by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to construct the 2007 Trustees Report. These were
obtained by request. The tables cover the historical period 1900-2004, and project future
mortality rates under three different alternative scenarios. For all calculations of projected age
adjustment, the intermediate scenario, Alternative II, is used. SSA maintains projected mortality
tables from 2005-2100. Population data from SSA were also used to determine the percent of
the population eligible for government programs under alternative measures of age.
Mortality tables for the gender-blended population were obtained for 1933-2004 from the
Human Mortality Database, which compiles detailed mortality data for a variety of countries. In
addition, mortality statistics by race through 2004 were obtained from the National Center for
Health Statistics (National Vital Statistics Reports, various years).
The analysis is based on period life tables, which report age-specific mortality rates in a
given year, rather than cohort life tables, which display age-specific mortality data for a group of

8

individuals born in the same year. While cohort life tables may give more accurate descriptions
of mortality statistics because they take into account improvements in mortality beyond the
current period, they are necessarily largely based on projected mortality improvements. For
example, the period remaining life expectancy of a 65-year-old female in 2004 is based on
mortality rates for 65-, 66-, …-year-old females in 2004. These mortality rates are likely to be
higher than the mortality that a 65-year-old female in 2004 will actually experience because she
will be 66 in 2005, 67 in 2006, and so on. However, the cohort remaining life expectancy of a
65-year-old female in 2004 computed today would have to assume rates of mortality
improvement for years beyond 2004.

Adjusting Government Policies for Age Inflation
Four methods are used to adjust ages in Social Security, Medicare, and IRAs for changes
in mortality:
1. Constant RLE. Under the Constant RLE method, two ages are equivalent if their
remaining life expectancies are equivalent.
2. Constant Mortality Risk. The Constant Mortality Risk method assumes that two ages
are equivalent if they have the same mortality risk.
3. Constant Percent of Life Expectancy (measured at birth). Two ages that have the
same ratio to the life expectancy of a newborn are equivalent under this method.
4. Constant Percent of Life Expectancy (measured at age 20). This method is similar to
the previous one (number 3), except that life expetancy is measured at age 20. This

9

method addresses the implausibility introduced by method 3 when the age of interest
is greater than the life expectancy at birth.
To illustrate these four methods further, suppose we would like to find the inflationadjusted age in 2004 of a 65-year-old woman in 1965. The remaining life expectancy of a 65year-old female in 1965 was 16.34. In 2004, a 68-year-old woman had a remaining life
expectancy of 16.80 and a 69-year-old woman had a remaining life expectancy of 16.06. The
true RLE-adjusted age in 2004 by the first method would be between 68 and 69, but because we
do not have mortality data by fractional years, we apply a decision rule to use the younger age so
that the individual at the adjusted age would have at least the same life expectancy in 2004
relative to 1965. Therefore, this method gives 68 as the answer we are looking for.
The mortality risk of a 65-year-old woman in 1965 was 1.79 percent. In 2004, the
mortality risk of a 69-year-old woman was 1.75 percent, and that of a 70-year-old woman was
1.93 percent. The adjusted age under the second method would therefore be between 69 and 70,
and we record the adjusted age to be 69, the age where the mortality risk is at most 1.79 percent.
A newborn girl in 1965 had an life expectancy of 73.84, and the remaining life
expectancy at age 20 for a female was 56.08. These values for 2004 were 79.6 and 60.36,
respectively. Age 65 represented 65/73.84 = 88 percent of the life expectancy of a newborn in
1965, and the equivalent age in 2004 is (0.88)(79.6) = 70.1, which would be the adjusted age
under the third method. If we instead use the life expectancy of a 20-year-old, 65 represented
65/(56.08+20) = 85.4 percent of the life expectancy, so the equivalent age in 2004 under the
fourth method would be (0.854)(60.36+20) = 68.7.
These four methods of calculation were done for seven different eligibility ages in the
rules governing Social Security, Medicare, and IRAs and defined contribution retirement plans to

10

find the mortality-equivalent ages in 2004. Each adjustment was done using gender-blended
mortality, as well as by using male and female mortality separately. The results are summarized
in Table 1.
Depending on the initial year of legislation and the method used, the adjustments are on
the order of three to eight years. For the majority of cases, the four methods yield similar results.
One exception is the adjustment of age 65 in 1935 to 2004 using the method which equates the
percent of the life expectancy measured at birth. This occurs because the life expectancy in 1935
at birth is actually less than age 65. Using instead the percent of life expectancy at age 20 yields
estimates that are more in line with the other two methods, implying that some of the mortality
improvement between 1935 and 2004 was in infant and childhood mortality. Mortality
improvements from age 20 onward may be more relevant in adjusting policies relating to work
and retirement.
Adjusting ages using mortality risk consistently produces adjustments that are larger than
those calculated by the constant RLE method. This reflects the higher concentration of mortality
in later ages discussed earlier. The superiority of one method over the other depends on which
measure – remaining life expectancy or mortality risk – better proxies for the factors taken into
account when determining eligibility.
The ages adjusted for female mortality are lower than those adjusted for male mortality
because women experienced less mortality improvement over most of the time periods
examined. The lower rate of improvement among women means that the gap in life expectancy
between men and women has been decreasing over this time period.
The overall results from Table 1 show that very significant adjustments would have to be
made in the ages in the laws we examine in order to restore the law to the original real age. For

11

instance, the Normal Retirement Age for Social Security in 2004 would have to be at least 71
(using lowest number in the table) and more likely 73 or 74 (using the gender blended results
from Methods 1 and 2) in order to be consistent with the real age of 65 in 1935. Using the same
logic, the age of Medicare eligibility would have needed to have been advanced by at least five
years. Such adjustments would be politically difficult, but age inflation and the lack of adjusting
for it has quite a bit to do with the solvency problems of Social Security and Medicare.
Next, we project the adjustments forward to 2050 using Social Security’s intermediate
estimates of future mortality. We produce estimates by gender separately, and use two different
starting points – the year of legislation, as assumed in Table 1, and 2004, the latest year of nonprojected mortality statistics. Assigning the year of legislation as the starting point addresses the
question of what the eligibility ages we consider would be in 2050 if ages were indexed from the
beginning using each of the four methods of age adjustment. Using 2004 as the starting point
speculates how things would look in 2050 based on projected mortality improvement if we
started indexing ages in 2004.
Table 2 summarizes the projected ages of eligibility in 2050. Because mortality is
projected to improve throughout the 2004 – 2050 period, the adjusted ages continue to go up.
Again, the four methods yield largely similar results. Adjusted ages using female mortality
continue to be less than ages adjusted using male mortality, indicating that projected mortality
rates also exhibit less mortality improvement among women. The mortality-equivalent ages
assuming adjustment starts in 2004 are much less dramatic than those calculated from the
legislation date, providing another indication of how much mortality has improved already.
The results that adjusting for age inflation would have on the number of people eligible to
receive entitlement benefits are striking. Figures 6 and 7 show the percent of the population

12

projected to meet age eligibility requirements for full retirement benefits in Social Security and
Medicare health insurance benefits under three different situations – ages were adjusted
beginning when the legislation was written; age adjustments began in 2004; and no age
adjustment occurs. The adjustment method assumed in these figures was the second method,
which finds the equivalent age based on mortality risk, computed for men and women separately,
and then averaged.
Figure 6 shows that without any adjustment in the age of eligibility for full retirement
(including the 1983 amendments which changed the normal retirement age gradually from 65 to
67), the percent of the population which would be eligible would rise from just under 7 percent
in 1941 to over 20 percent in 2050. If adjustments had happened automatically, only 9.35
percent of the population would be eligible in 2050. Even if adjustments start occurring today,
the projections show that more than 17 percent of the population would receive full retirement
benefits in 2050. The data in Figure 7 show a similar pattern. This indicates that because all of
the substantial life expectancy improvements that have occurred thus far have been allocated as
eligible years rather than non-eligible years, adjusting in the future will have less dramatic an
effect.

Heterogeneity in Mortality Improvement
An important concern for a policy that indexes ages of eligibility to life expectancy
improvements is that mortality improvement in most cases will not be uniform across all
demographic groups. It was already shown that men and women experienced different rates of
improvement in mortality historically, causing the adjusted age to be different depending on
whether male- or female-based mortality statistics were used.

13

We explore this issue further by tabulating mortality-adjusted ages by race and gender to
the extent that sufficient data are available. Data limitations allow us to only examine two racial
distinctions (black and white), and to examine historical changes in mortality but not projected
changes. For starting years prior to 1965, detailed data on mortality risk and remaining life
expectancy is not available, but we are still able to calculate adjustments using the third and
fourth methods of adjustment using life expectancy at birth and at age 20. Our results are
summarized in Table 3. The data generally support the idea that while the level of mortality
varies significantly across different racial groups, with blacks having worse mortality than
whites, the amount of mortality improvement does not vary as dramatically. In fact, within each
gender group, the implied adjustment is higher for blacks than it is for whites in a majority of
cases. This phenomenon is particularly true when comparing black women to white women.
Which racial group has had more improvement also seems to depend on what definition
of improvement is used. Under the first method of adjusting ages, which uses increases in
remaining life expectancy as the relevant measure of mortality, the mortality-equivalent ages for
whites tend to be higher than those for blacks, indicating a greater degree of mortality
improvement. The measures that use percent of life expectancy as the relevant measure tend to
yield higher adjusted ages for blacks relative to whites, and the results using mortality risk are
more mixed. These results imply that blacks have had larger gains in mortality early in life, but
that the racial gap in mortality among the elderly has persisted.
It is important to note that the current policy of a single age of eligibility applying to the
entire population implicitly redistributes from individuals with short life expectancies to those
with higher life expectancies. Social Security and Medicare benefits are paid as lifetime benefits
and actuarial adjustments to retirement benefits are based on average mortality. Thus, while

14

heterogeneity in mortality improvement implies that some groups would benefit more from
indexing eligibility ages to age inflation, heterogeneity in mortality rates indicate that current
eligibility rules also redistribute between demographic groups.
One way to address the issue of heterogeneous rates of mortality improvement would be
to have a different age of eligibility for each race-sex cell, with each eligibility age indexed
based on the mortality improvements in that cell. However, this would likely not be practical to
administer. Another way would be to index to the minimum level of mortality improvement.
While some groups have had more improvement than others in mortality, all of the groups
examined have experienced substantial gains. This approach would not address the fact that age
indexation would benefit some groups more than others, but it would decrease the possibility that
one group would be significantly worse off due to another group’s mortality improvements.

Disability-Free Life Expectancy
Our four methods of adjusting nominal ages to real ages are all based on mortality or life
expectancy – that is, they depend on the evolution over time of survival probabilities as reflected
in a time series of period life tables. In some sense, they are based on a two-state model where
people are either alive or dead. What many people mean when they categorize people as elderly
is people who have disabilities or reduced functionality. This raises the question of whether the
increase in life expectancies and the decrease in age-specific mortality rates imply an increase in
disability-free life expectancy and a decrease in the age-specific disability rates.
There is a large literature on this matter. There is some evidence that disability-free life
expectancies have grown by at least as much as overall life expectancies and that age specific
disability rates have fallen in line with mortality rates. For instance, a recent paper by Manton

15

and Lamb (2007) shows that while life expectancy of 85-year-olds increased by one year
between 1965 and 1999, their “active life expectancy” increased by 1.5 years (and the expected
disabled years actually fell by 0.5 years). Manton and Lamb find that the expected future years
in disability for 85-year-olds decreased for both men and women. Manton and Land (2000) find
that 13.7 of the 15.7 years of remaining expected life for 65-year-old men are disability-free,
whereas for women, the corresponding numbers are 15.7 of the remaining 22.2 years. The
overall findings of Manton and his co-authors is that the number of years in disability has not
been growing in the past few decades.
Cutler, Liebman and Smyth (2006) come to similar conclusions. They show that the
same percentage of men age 62 in the mid-1970s report themselves to be in fair or poor health as
72-year-old men in the mid-1990s. They also show that impairment associated with heart
disease has declined over the same period as measured by the number of days spent in bed, and
that the share of the population with limitations in activities of daily living has declined. They
state, “Our best guess is that people aged 62 in the 1960s or 1970s are in equivalent health to
people aged 70 or more today. All of these results conflict with previous work by Crimmons and
Saito (1997) which found that healthy life expectancies grew by much less than total life
expectancies between 1970 and 1990.

However, the majority of the evidence suggests that

health status has been improving along with mortality.
Our feeling is that while the growth in active life expectancies or healthy life
expectancies would be useful for indexing nominal ages in retirement laws, the data are not yet
of the same quality as the mortality data contained in the period life tables. This means that
more research and information about the transitions between functional and disabled status is
necessary before disability-free life expectancies are ready to be used for age inflation indexing.

16

Conclusion
The significant mortality improvement that has been experienced in the United States
over the last century means that age, as conventionally measured by years since birth, has a
different meaning today than it did in the past. Government policies that are based on age fail to
adjust to the fact that a given age is associated with a higher remaining life expectancy and lower
mortality risk with each passing year.
In this paper, we evaluate eligibility ages contained in the rules governing three public
programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Individual Retirement Accounts. We calculate
adjustments to these eligibility ages using four different definitions of mortality-equivalence –
remaining life expectancy, mortality risk, or percent of expected life expectancy at age zero and
at age 20. We first assume that age indexation began when the eligibility age was initially
established and show how it would have changed by 2004. We then use projected mortality
estimates to forecast the effect of age inflation on eligibility ages to 2050. We also calculate age
adjustments for different demographic groups to explore the effect of differences in mortality
and mortality improvement on age inflation.
The results indicate that, on average, historical adjustment of eligibility ages for age
inflation would have increased ages of eligibility by approximately 0.15 years annually. The
adjustments implied by improvements in female mortality are smaller than those calculated using
male mortality improvement, and differences in mortality improvement across race are not as
large as the differences in the base level of mortality. Estimates of projected mortality show that
future adjustments would be lower, approximately 0.08 years per annum, indicating that a lower
rate of mortality improvement is implicit in Social Security’s intermediate estimates of projected

17

mortality. This slowing in the rate of improvement is far from agreed upon amongst U.S.
demographers, and Social Security mortality projections have underestimated mortality
improvements in the past.
The idea of indexing nominal ages to generate real ages requires an appropriate metric for
the indexation. While we have used four such metrics, another appealing one would be to index
age by the change in disability-free life expectancies. We briefly examined the state of
knowledge about the evolution of active (or disability-free) life expectancies. There is some
evidence that active life expectancies have been growing as rapidly as total life expectancies.
However, in our opinion, the evidence is not sufficiently agreed upon to be used to adjust ages in
government programs.
Implementing a policy that explicitly adjusts ages of eligibility for improvements in
mortality would have important practical considerations. One such consideration would be the
lead time that individuals would have in planning for the future. It would not be sensible to wait
to announce a cohort’s normal retirement age, for example, in the year they are planning to
retire. One approach may be to lock in a cohort’s retirement age at a pre-determined time, such
as when the cohort attains 55 years of age.
The four methods of calculating mortality-equivalent ages that we examined give
different results regarding the amount of adjustment that would yield equivalent ages. Each uses
a measure of mortality that summarizes a different dimension of mortality improvement, and the
most appropriate measure, perhaps different than the four described here, would depend on
which dimension best captures the intent of the initial legislation that defined the initial age of
eligibility. In addition, the four methods we describe implicitly assume that all future
improvements in mortality should be working years, rather than under the status quo where life

18

expectancy gains have been taken as years of eligibility. It is reasonable to believe that a more
appropriate treatment would be somewhere between these two extremes, where gains in life
expectancy are shared between eligible and non-eligible years in some manner.
In many ways, adjusting ages of eligibility for age inflation is similar to adjusting income
or asset thresholds for price inflation. Prior to 1985, the parameters of the U.S. income tax code
were not indexed to inflation, and high inflation rates in the late 1960’s and 1970’s caused
“bracket creep,” where more and more households were subject to high marginal tax rates
because their incomes were rising in nominal terms even as their real incomes were held
constant. Currently, many parameters of the income tax system are indexed to inflation to avoid
this from occurring. The one major exception is the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was
designed to keep taxpayers with high incomes from paying little or no income tax by taking
advantage of various preferences in the tax code. Today, this tax is affecting a growing number
of middle-class taxpayers. We think that the legislative intent of the AMT has been distorted due
to the failure to inflation index the amount of income that can be exempted from the tax..
Adjusting government policies for age inflation would have a large impact on the
number of individuals eligible to receive entitlement benefits, and consequently, on the financing
of these public programs. Shultz and Shoven (2008) state that the total labor supply in 2050
would be at least 9 percent higher if workers retired with the same lengths of retirement as they
do today, relative to what it would be if they retired at the same ages as today. Estimates in the
literature suggest that the elderly have high labor supply elasticities (French 2005), and the
effects of policies that index eligibility ages for mortality improvement on labor markets, health,
and government budgets is an important area for future research.
