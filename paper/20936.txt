                                            ABSTRACT

We conducted a laboratory experiment to test the comparative statics predictions of a new approach
to collective action games based on the method of stability sets. We find robust support for the main
theoretical predictions. As we increase the payoff of a successful collective action (accruing to all
players and only to those who contribute), the share of cooperators increases. The experiment also
points to new avenues for refining the theory. We find that, as the payoff of a successful collective
action increases, subjects tend to upgrade their prior beliefs as to the expected share of cooperators.
Although this does not have a qualitative effect on comparative static predictions, using the reported
distribution of beliefs rather than an ad hoc uniform distribution reduces the gap between theoretical
predictions and observed outcomes. This finding also allows to decompose the mechanism that leads
to more cooperation into a ”belief effect” and a ”range of cooperation effect”.

1. Introduction

The rational-choice theory of collective action comprises two main paradigms. Olson’s
model regards collective action as a prisoners’ dilemma with only one equilibrium
(Olson, 1965), while Schelling’s model depicts it as a tipping game with multiple
equilibria (Schelling, 1978). Medina (2007) develops a unifying framework that covers
both paradigms and produces novel comparative statics predictions about the effects of
the parameters of the game on the probability of a successful collective action. In this
paper we use a simple laboratory experiment to test some of these implications.

The unifying framework relies on the notion of stability sets to deal with multiple
equilibria. The method of stability sets originally proposed by Harsanyi and Selten
(1988) and further developed and applied to collective action problems by Medina
(2007) is a very useful theoretical tool for studying large collective action games with
multiple equilibria. The crucial advantage of the stability-sets method is that it provides
an assessment of the likelihood of different equilibria as a function of the payoffs of the
game and the distribution of prior beliefs. Thus, the method can be used to generate
clear predictions on the comparative statics of the probability of a successful collective
action with respect to any variable that affects the payoffs of the collective action game.
The focus of this paper is to test these comparative statics predictions using a controlled,
randomized laboratory experiment. In particular, we concentrate on testing a key
theoretical prediction of the new framework. The probability of a successful collective
action should increase in line with the benefit accrued to all players involved, including
those who do not contribute if the collective action is successful, as well as in line with
the extra benefit obtained by those who do contribute.

In order to test these predictions, we conducted a laboratory experiment at the
Universidad de San Andrés and the Universidad Nacional de La Plata in the Province of
Buenos Aires, Argentina. We recruited undergraduate and graduate students from any
field of study and regardless of their knowledge of game theory and economics. We
conducted 16 sessions (7 at the Universidad de San Andrés and 9 at the Universidad
Nacional de La Plata) with 20 subjects each, totaling 320 participants. In each round of
each session, subjects were randomly allocated into groups of 10 and asked to play a
simple game. At the beginning, each subject has 1 point and must decide whether to
invest it or not. The probability that the investment is successful depends on the share of



                                             2
subjects who contribute their point. If the investment is successful, all players obtain 𝐵
points and those who contributed obtain 𝑠 extra points. Depending on the values of 𝐵
and 𝑠, the game has one Nash equilibrium in which nobody contribute, or three Nash
equilibria, one in which nobody contributes, another in which all contribute and a third
one in which each player contributes with positive probability (the same for all players).
We consider 4 possible treatments. Treatment 1 is the baseline free-rider Olsonian
model with one Nash equilibrium in which nobody contributes. In treatments 2 to 4, we
gradually increase 𝐵 and/or 𝑠 , inducing multiple equilibria. Furthermore, the
probability of a successful collective action predicted by the stability-sets method is 0 in
treatment 1 and increases to 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 in treatments 2, 3, and 4, respectively
(assuming initial beliefs about the expected share of cooperators are uniformly
distributed).

In general, we find robust support for the main theoretical predictions of the
stability-sets method applied to collective action. As 𝐵 and/or 𝑠 are increased, the
share of cooperators and, hence, the probability of a successful collective action
increases. Analogous results are obtained for the payoffs. The effects are statistically
significant whether or not we include controls for individual characteristics, level of
understanding of the game as measured by performance on a quiz before playing the
rounds, fixed effects by session, whether or not subjects are asked to report their prior
beliefs about the expected share of cooperators, whether or not the collective action was
successful in the previous round, and the number of players in the same group who
decided to invest in the previous round.

We also find that, on average, there is more cooperation than predicted by the theory
when theoretical predictions are obtained under different assumptions regarding the
distribution of expected cooperators. As a benchmark, we first assume that subjects’
prior beliefs about the share of cooperators have a uniform distribution over the interval
[0,1] for all treatments. This can be considered to be a Laplacian assumption when no
information on prior beliefs is available. Second, in some randomly selected sessions,
before subjects started playing, we asked them to report their prior beliefs as to the
share of cooperators in each treatment. We find that subjects’ prior beliefs are not
uniformly distributed and vary among treatments. Specifically, as the benefit of
cooperation increases, subjects upgrade their assessments concerning the expected



                                             3
share of cooperators. Using reported prior beliefs to compute the theoretical prediction
regarding the probability of successful collective action reduces the gap between the
model predictions and observed behavior. Even so, the data point to the existence of
more cooperation than expected.

Finally, taking into account the fact that prior beliefs vary among treatments, we
decompose the total effect on the probability of a successful collective action into two
analytically different effects. In particular, as the benefit of cooperation increases,
subjects upgrade their assessments of the expected share of cooperators. We illustrate
how to compute the change in the probability of a successful collective action attributed
to belief upgrading (belief effect) and to an increase in the range of prior beliefs that
induce cooperation (range of cooperation effect).

There are two branches of experimental literature connected with this work. First, there
is a vast literature on laboratory and field experiments with voluntary contribution
games, public goods games and common pool resource games. Second, a large number of
experiments have been conducted that employ games with multiple equilibria.

Experiments with Public Good Games. Many laboratory experiments have been
conducted with static public good games with only one Nash equilibrium.6 Most of these
studies have found levels of cooperation that are significantly above theoretical
predictions. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon
(kindness, altruism, conditional cooperation, reciprocity, repetition, etc.7). Although we
also find more cooperation than predicted by the theory in most of our treatments and,
in particular, in treatment 1, which has only one Nash equilibrium, the focus of our work
is on testing the comparative static predictions of stability-set methods in the context of
multiple equilibria. Closer to our work are the experiments with static threshold public
good games.8 In contrast to standard public good games, threshold public good games
have many efficient equilibria, resulting in a coordination problem.9 The collective
action game that we consider in this paper can have multiple equilibria, but never

multiple efficient equilibria. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, the
predictions provided by the stability-sets method have never been tested in the context
of a threshold public good game.10

Multiple equilibria and selection. There is also a large body of literature on
experiments with multiple equilibria games and equilibrium selection.11 Most of this
literature has been focused on testing different equilibrium selection criteria and
learning rules. In some sense, we are adopting and testing a different approach to
multiple equilibria. Instead of focusing on identifying different criteria for equilibrium
selection, we use the stability-sets method to obtain theoretical predictions of the
probability of occurrence of each of the Nash equilibria of the collective action game.12

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical
framework. Section 3 describes the laboratory experiment. Section 4 explains how it was
determined that subjects understood the game that they were playing and that the
randomization was balanced. Section 5 presents descriptive statistics for the main
variables. Section 6 presents the main results of the paper. Section 7 shows a
decomposition of a change in the predicted share of cooperators in a ”belief effect” that
captures the change in prior beliefs and a ”range of cooperation effect” that captures the
change in the range of prior beliefs that induced cooperation. Finally, Section 8
concludes.




10 In addition to laboratory experiments, field experiments with collective action games have also been
conducted. See, for example, Schmitt (2000), Cardenas (2003) and Barr et al. (2012). However, none of
them has tested the comparative statics predictions derived from the stability-set method.

opinion games; Battalio et al. (2001) and Golman and Page (2010) for stag-hunt games; Cason et al.
(2004), Neugebauer et al. (2008) and Oprea et al. (2011) for hawk-dove games; and Haruvy and Stahl
(2000) for symmetric normal-form games with multiple Nash equilibria. There is also a large body of
literature on tests of equilibrium selection theories in multiple equilibrium games with repeated
interactions. See, for example, Van Huyck et al. (1990, 1991) and Iwasaki et al. (2003).
12 Golman and Page (2010) use a related approach to compare cultural learning with belief-based
learning. They consider a class of generalized stag-hunt games in which agents can choose from among
multiple potentially cooperative actions or can opt for a secure, self-interested action. Though the set of
stable equilibria is identical under the two learning rules, the basins of attraction for the efficient
equilibria are much larger for cultural learning. Moreover, as the stakes grow arbitrarily, cultural learning
always locates an efficient equilibrium while belief-based learning never does.

2. Theoretical Framework

In this section, we present a collective action model based on Medina (2007). Then, we
adapt the model for use in a laboratory experiment. We focus on the comparative static
results of the model under two different assumptions regarding the distribution of prior
beliefs concerning the expected share of cooperators. First, we assume that the
distribution of prior beliefs is fixed for the whole set of parameters of the collective
action game. Second, we relax this assumption and assume that a change in parameters
that increases the set of beliefs that induce cooperation leads to a new distribution of
prior beliefs that first-order stochastically dominates the prior one.

2.1. A collective action model (based on Medina 2007). Consider a set of players
𝑵 > 𝟐. For each player, the set of pure strategies is 𝑨𝒊 = {𝑪𝒊 , 𝑫𝒊 }, where 𝑪𝒊 = 𝟏 and
𝑫𝒊 = 𝟎 denote “cooperate” and “defect”, respectively. Let 𝒂𝒊 indicate a generic
element of 𝑨𝒊 . The set of mixed strategies is ∆(𝑨𝒊 ), and 𝜶𝒊 indicates a generic element
of ∆(𝑨𝒊 ) , where 𝜶𝒊 = 𝐏𝐫(𝑪𝒊 ) and (𝟏 − 𝜶𝒊 ) = 𝐏𝐫(𝑫𝒊 ) . Let 𝑨 =×𝑵
                                                                 𝒊=𝟏 𝑨𝒊 , and 𝒂

indicates a generic element of 𝑨. There are two possible outcomes: either the collective
action is a success or it is a failure, indicated by 𝑺 and 𝑭, respectively. The probability
that the collective action is successful is a function 𝑮 of the proportion of players who
                                                                𝟏
cooperate. Formally, 𝐏𝐫(𝑺) = 𝑮(𝜸(𝒂)) , where 𝜸(𝒂) = 𝑵 #{𝒊: 𝒂𝒊 = 𝑪𝒊 } . Logically,

𝐏𝐫 (𝑭) = 𝟏 − 𝐏𝐫(𝑺). 𝑮 is assumed to be continuous, monotonically increasing (as the
proportion of cooperators rises, the probability of success also increases) and 𝑮(𝟎) =
𝟎. The payoff for each player 𝒖𝒊 depends only on the player’s action and the outcome of
the collective action. Thus, 𝒖𝒊 can be fully described with just four numbers: 𝒖𝒊 (𝑪𝒊 , 𝑺)
(the payoff when i cooperates and the collective action is successful), 𝒖𝒊 (𝑪𝒊 , 𝑭) (the
payoff when i cooperates and the collective action does not prosper), 𝒖𝒊 (𝑫𝒊 , 𝑺) (the
payoff when i defects and the collective actions is successful) and 𝒖𝒊 (𝑫𝒊 , 𝑭) (the payoff
when i defects and the collective action does not prosper). Moreover, we will assume
that, for all 𝒊, it is always the case that 𝐦𝐢𝐧 {𝒖𝒊 (𝑪𝒊 , 𝑺), 𝒖𝒊 (𝑫𝒊 , 𝑺)} > 𝒖𝒊 (𝑫𝒊 , 𝑭) >
𝒖𝒊 (𝑪𝒊 , 𝑭).

Medina (2007) studies this game when 𝑁 → ∞, i.e., he focuses on a large game of
collective action. We briefly summarize his results when all players have identical payoff
functions. Any correlated equilibrium of a large game of collective action can be




                                             6
                                                                         𝑢 (𝐷 ,𝐹)−𝑢 (𝐶 ,𝐹)
represented by an aggregate share 𝛾𝜇 . Define 𝑊 = 𝑢 (𝐷 ,𝐹)−𝑢𝑖 (𝐶𝑖 ,𝐹)+𝑢𝑖 (𝐶𝑖 ,𝑆)−𝑢 (𝐷 ,𝑆) . If
                                                                 𝑖   𝑖    𝑖   𝑖    𝑖    𝑖    𝑖   𝑖

𝑊 > 1, then there exists a unique equilibrium where nobody cooperates (𝛾𝜇 = 0).
However, if 0 < 𝑊 < 1, the large game of collective action has three correlated
equilibria: One equilibrium in which all players cooperate (𝛾𝜇 = 1), another in which
nobody cooperates (𝛾𝜇 = 0) and a third one in which there is an intermediate level of
cooperation given by 𝐺(𝛾𝜇 ) = 𝑊. In order to deal with the multiplicity of equilibria,
Medina (2007) extends the notion of stability sets originated by Harsanyi and Selten
(1988). He uses a methodology known as the “tracing procedure” to assign a set of initial
belief conditions to each equilibrium. These conditions can be represented as a share of
expected cooperators 𝛾𝜂 . Then, the stability set of an equilibrium is defined as the set
𝛾𝜂 assigned to it. The key result states that 𝛾𝜂 < 𝑊 belongs to the stability set of
𝛾𝜇 = 0, while 𝛾𝜂 > 𝑊 belongs to the stability set of 𝛾𝜇 = 1. As Medina (2007)
emphasizes, the threshold value of 𝛾𝜂 that separates the stability set of 𝛾𝜇 = 0 from
the set of 𝛾𝜇 = 1 is associated with the mixed-strategy equilibrium implicitly given by
𝐺(𝛾𝜇 ) = 𝑊. In order to see this more clearly, assume that 𝐺(𝛾) = 𝛾. Then, the stability
set of 𝛾𝜇 = 0 is the set of all shares of expected cooperators lower than the
mixed-strategy equilibrium share of cooperators 𝛾𝜇 = 𝑊, while the stability set of
𝛾𝜇 = 1 is the set of all shares of expected cooperators higher than the mixed-strategy
equilibrium share of cooperators 𝛾𝜇 = 𝑊.

Finally, Medina (2007) shows how to use stability sets to compute the probability of
cooperation. In order to do so, assume that the initial belief conditions 𝛾𝜂 are
distributed with the CDF H. Then:

              Pr(𝛾𝜇 = 1) = Pr (𝛾𝜂 > 𝑊) = 1 − Pr (𝛾𝜂 < 𝑊) = 1 − 𝐻(𝑊)

This expression is very useful for deducing comparative static results. In particular, note
that, as 𝑊 increases, the probability of cooperation decreases.

Olson’s Model (single Nash equilibrium for large N): The standard Olson’s public
good model of collective action is a special case of the above model when the payoffs are
given by:

              𝑢𝑖 (𝐶𝑖 , 𝑆) = 𝐵 − 𝑐, 𝑢𝑖 (𝐷𝑖 , 𝑆) = 𝐵, 𝑢𝑖 (𝐶𝑖 , 𝐹) = −𝑐, 𝑢𝑖 (𝐷𝑖 , 𝐹) = 0                (1)



                                                7
where c >0. For this model, 𝑊 = ∞. Hence, when 𝑁 → ∞, the unique equilibrium is
𝛾𝜇 = 0. More intuitively, in a large group (𝑁 → ∞) there is a free rider problem (it is a
dominant strategy for every player to defeat) that impedes the members of the group
from furthering their common interests.

Schelling’s model (multiple Nash equilibria for large N): Consider a simple
modification of Olson’s model:

              𝑢𝑖 (𝐶𝑖 , 𝑆) = 𝐵 − 𝑐 + 𝑠, 𝑢𝑖 (𝐷𝑖 , 𝑆) = 𝐵, 𝑢𝑖 (𝐶𝑖 , 𝐹) = −𝑐, 𝑢𝑖 (𝐷𝑖 , 𝐹) = 0   (2)

                                              𝑐
where 𝑠 > 𝑐 > 0. For this model 𝑊 = 𝑠 < 1. Hence, when 𝑁 → ∞, there are three
                                                                        𝑐
Nash equilibria 𝛾𝜇 = 0, 𝛾𝜇 = 1, and 𝛾𝜇 such that 𝐺(𝛾𝜇 ) = 𝑠 . The stability set of

𝛾𝜇 = 0 is {𝛾𝜂 : 0 ≤ 𝛾𝜂 < 𝑊}, while the stability set of 𝛾𝜇 = 1 is {𝛾𝜂 : 𝑊 < 𝛾𝜂 ≤ 1}. More
intuitively, introducing an extra payoff 𝑠 > 𝑐 that is obtained only by those who
cooperate when the collective action is successful transforms Olson’s game into a
coordination game with multiple equilibria. If everybody defeats, the best strategy is to
defeat, but if everybody cooperates, the best strategy is to cooperate. Moreover, there is
                                                               𝑐
a threshold for the share of expected cooperators (𝑊 = 𝑠) such that players cooperate if

and only if they expect there to be more cooperators than this threshold value. Finally, if
the expected share of cooperators 𝛾𝜂 is distributed with the cumulative distribution
function H, we have:

                                  𝑐
              Pr(𝛾𝜇 = 1) = 1 − 𝐻 ( )
                                  𝑠

Hence, as 𝑐 decreases and/or 𝑠 increases, the probability of cooperation increases. In
Schelling’s model, according to the stability-sets method, as 𝑐 decreases and/or 𝑠
increases, it is more likely that players will coordinate in the efficient equilibrium.



2.2. Laboratory adaptation. In order to test the predictions derived by Medina (2007)
using a laboratory experiment, we need to make some adjustments to the model
presented in the previous section. The most important change is that we must consider
the case when N is finite. This implies that we need to compute a threshold for the
number of players such that the game with finite N has the same set of equilibria as the



                                                  8
large game. To do so, we focus on simple cases. In particular, we will assume 𝑮(𝜸) = 𝜸
when studying the Olson and Schelling models.

We begin by defining a Nash equilibrium for the game of collective action when N is
finite. Let 𝑆(𝑘) = {𝑎: ∑𝑗 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘} and 𝑆(𝑘, 𝑖) = {𝑎−1 : ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘}. 𝑆(𝑘) is the set of
pure strategy profiles in which 𝑘 players cooperate, while 𝑆(𝑘, 𝑖) is the set of pure
strategy profiles of all players except i in which k players cooperate. Given a strategy
profile 𝛼 = (𝛼𝑖 , 𝛼−𝑖 ), we can compute the probability that 𝑘 players cooperate given
                                                                                       𝑎
that player i does not cooperate. This is given by 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = ∑𝑎−𝑖 𝜖 𝑆(𝑘,𝑖) ∏𝑗≠𝑖 𝛼𝑗 𝑗 (1 −

𝛼𝑗 )1−𝛼𝑗 .

Therefore, the payoff for player i associated with the strategy profile 𝛼 = (𝛼𝑖 , 𝛼−𝑖 ) is
given by:

                                 𝑁−1
                                                                     𝑘+1
             𝑈𝑖 (𝛼𝑖 , 𝛼−𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝑖 ∑ [(𝑢𝑖 (𝐶𝑖 , 𝑆) − 𝑢𝑖 (𝐶𝑖 , 𝐹))𝐺 (       )
                                                                      𝑁
                                 𝑘=0

Definition 1. A Nash equilibrium for the collective action game with finite N is a strategy
profile α such that, for each I, one of the following conditions holds:
             𝑈𝑖 (1, 𝛼−𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑈𝑖 (0, 𝛼−𝑖 ) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛼𝑖 = 1
             𝑈𝑖 (1, 𝛼−𝑖 ) ≤ 𝑈𝑖 (0, 𝛼−𝑖 ) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛼𝑖 = 0
             𝑈𝑖 (1, 𝛼−𝑖 ) = 𝑈𝑖 (0, 𝛼−𝑖 ) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛼𝑖 ∈ (0,1)



The following proposition characterizes the set of Nash equilibria for the Olson and
Schelling collective action games when N is finite and 𝐺(𝛾) = 𝛾.



Proposition 1. Suppose that N is finite and 𝐺(𝛾) = 𝛾. Then:

1. Olson’s model: Assume that 𝑢𝑖 is given by (1). Then, if 𝑁 < 𝑐 , the unique Nash

equilibrium is 𝐶𝑖 for all i, while, if 𝑁 > 𝑐 , the unique Nash equilibrium is 𝐷𝑖 for all i.

                                                             𝑐

all i, 𝐷𝑖 for all i, and 𝛼𝑖 = 𝛼̂ =                   for all i. Moreover, in the third Nash equilibrium,
                                        𝑠(𝑁−1)
                                                 𝑘
the expected share of cooperators is 𝚬 [𝑁] = 𝛼̂.

Proof: See Online Appendix 1. ■



                                 𝐵
Summing up, when 𝑁 > 𝑐 , the unique Nash equilibrium for Olson’s model with finite N

is 𝐷𝑖 for all i, which coincides with the equilibrium for Olson’s model when N→∞.
                           𝐵+𝑠
Similarly, when 𝑁 >              , the set of Nash equilibria for Schelling’s model with finite N is
                             𝑐
                                                     𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑠
𝐶𝑖 for all i, 𝐷𝑖 for all i, and 𝛼𝑖 = 𝛼̂ =                        for all i, which is analogous to the set of
                                                     𝑠(𝑁−1)

Nash equilibria for Schelling’s model when 𝑁 → ∞ . Note, in particular, that
               𝑐
lim𝑁→∞ 𝛼̂ = 𝑠, which is the share of cooperators in the mixed strategy equilibrium in the

large game.

Suppose that, as in the large collective action game, we use the mixed strategy
equilibrium for Schelling’s model with finite N to compute the probability of occurrence
of the two pure strategy equilibria. In particular, assume that the share of expected
cooperators 𝛾𝜂 is distributed according to the cumulative distribution function 𝐻.
Then:

we       have         Pr (𝐶𝑖 for all 𝑖 ) =                     and,      hence,                           = 𝑠(𝑁−1) > 0,

increases or c decreases, the threshold for the share of expected cooperators that makes
players indifferent to the choice of cooperating or defeating decreases. Cooperation
becomes more attractive and, hence, players require a lower share of expected
cooperators in order to cooperate. Thus, given the distribution of the share of expected
cooperators, the probability of cooperation increases.

increases or c decreases, the probability of cooperation increases for two reasons. First,
the threshold for the share of expected cooperators that makes players indifferent to the

choice of cooperating or defeating decreases. Second, initial beliefs about the expected
share of cooperators are updated in the sense that the new distribution gives at least as
high a probability of an initial belief being at least 𝛾𝜂 as the prior distribution does.



3. The Laboratory Experiment

In this section we describe our laboratory experiment. First, we provide a general
description of the experiment, including its monetary payoffs, number of sessions and
rounds, matching procedure and the instructions received by the subjects. Second, we
give a detailed description of the game that the subjects played. Finally, we summarize
the treatments and compute the corresponding theoretically predicted outcomes.



3.1. General description of the experiment. The experiment was conducted in May -
October 2014 at the Universidad de San Andrés and the Universidad Nacional de La
Plata, both of which are located in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. We recruited
undergraduate and graduate students from any field of study and regardless of how
familiar they were with game theory and economic theory. We conducted 16 sessions
with 20 subjects each, totaling 320 participants. Subjects were allowed to participate in
only one session. Every session included four treatments, which made it possible to
avoid any treatment selection problem. In each treatment, subjects were asked to play a
collective action game. The experiment was programmed and conducted using z-Tree
software (Fischbacher, 2007). Each session lasted approximately 50 minutes. The
experiment proceeded as follows:

1. Allocation to computer terminals. Before each session began, subjects were
randomly assigned to computer terminals.

2. Instructions. After subjects were at their terminals, they received the instructions,
which were also explained by the organizers. Subjects then had time to read the
instructions on their own and ask questions. Online Appendix 2.1 contains an English
translation (from Spanish) of the script that we employed to provide instructions while
Online Appendix 2.2 contains the printed version of the instructions. This was the last
opportunity that subjects had to ask questions.




                                             12
3. Prior beliefs. At the beginning of randomly selected sessions, subjects were asked to
report their assessments of how the game would unfold.13 In particular, for each
treatment, we asked each subject how many subjects from a group of 10 they thought
would contribute their point. This allowed us to obtain an empirical distribution of
individuals’ prior beliefs regarding the expected share of cooperators for each
treatment. The questions we asked can be found in Online Appendix 2.3.

4. Quiz. In order to check whether participants understood the rules of the game, we
asked them to take a five-question quiz. The quiz was administered after we had given
the instructions, but before the rounds began. Subjects were paid approximately US$
0.25 per correct answer, but we never informed them which ones they had answered
correctly. The quiz questions can be found in Online Appendix 2.4.

5. Rounds. After the subjects had finished the quiz, they began playing rounds, during
which they interacted solely through a computer network using z-Tree software.
Subjects played 16 rounds of the collective action game. The first 4 rounds were for
practice, and the last 12 rounds were for pay. At the end of each round, subjects received
a summary of the decisions taken by both themselves and their partners, including
payoffs per round, their own accumulated payoffs for paid rounds and nature’s decision.
Online Appendix 2.5 provides some samples of the screens that the subjects saw.

6. Matching. In odd-numbered rounds, 10 players were randomly matched and played
treatment 1 (𝑇1 ), while the other 10 players played treatment 3 (𝑇3 ). In even-numbered
rounds, 10 players were randomly matched and played treatment 2 (𝑇2 ), while the other
10 players played treatment 1 (𝑇4 ). See below for a detailed explanation of the
treatments.

7. Questionnaire. Finally, just before leaving the laboratory, all the subjects were asked
to complete a questionnaire which was designed to enable us to test the balance across
experimental groups and to control for their characteristics in the econometric analysis.
This questionnaire is presented in Online Appendix 2.6.

8. Payments. All subjects were paid privately, in cash. After the experiment was
completed, a password appeared on each subject’s screen. The subjects then had to
present this password to the person who was running the experiment in order to receive

13 For each session, all participants were asked to report their prior beliefs with probability 1/2. Thus, on
average, subjects reported their prior beliefs in half of the sessions.


                                                     13
their payoffs. Subjects earned, on average, US$ 11.80, which included a US$ 2 show-up
fee, US$ 0.25 per correct answer on the quiz and US$ 0.25 for each point they received
during the paid rounds of the experiment. All payments were made in Argentine
currency; at the time, US$ 1 was equivalent to AR$ 8.14



3.2. Treatments and predicted outcomes. Once they had finished the quiz, subjects
directed their attention to their computers and proceeded to play the first round of the
session. In each round, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups, each
consisting of 10 participants. At the beginning of the round they received one point and
then decided whether to keep it for themselves or to invest it in a common fund. The
probability that the investment in the common fund would be successful equals the
share of subjects who contribute their point out of the group of 10. If the investment was
successful, all players obtained 𝑩 points and those who contributed obtained 𝒔 extra
points.

The experiment consisted of four different treatments. The first treatment represents a
scenario of no cooperation opportunities (𝑩 = 𝟏. 𝟐𝟓 and 𝒔 = 𝟎); in other words, this is
the free-rider Olsonian model with one Nash equilibrium, in which nobody contributes.
In treatments 2 to 4, we gradually increased 𝑩 and/or 𝒔, inducing multiple equilibria.
Specifically, the second treatment represents a scenario of low cooperation
opportunities (𝑩 = 𝟏. 𝟐𝟓 and 𝒔 = 𝟏. 𝟐𝟓); the third treatment is associated with a
scenario of high (but not full) cooperation opportunities (𝑩 = 𝟑 and 𝒔 = 𝟏. 𝟐𝟓); and
the fourth, a scenario where the incentives to cooperate are the highest (𝑩 = 𝟑 and
𝒔 = 𝟏. 𝟕𝟓).

Table 1 summarizes the relevant parameters for each treatment and indicates the
predicted share of contributors and the predicted profit if there are 10 players in each
group and assuming that prior beliefs are uniformly distributed in the interval [𝟎, 𝟏𝟎].




14 Since Argentina’s rate of inflation was very high, we adjusted the conversion rate in order to maintain
the purchasing power of the payments. Thus, from May to July, the conversion rate was 2 pesos per point,
while, from August to October, it was 2.4 pesos per point.

4. Understanding of the Game and Randomization Balance

In this section we show that subjects understood the game and that the randomization
was balanced. Table 2 shows that, on average, subjects understood the rules of the game.
Indeed, 81% of them answered question 1 correctly, 95% answered question 2
correctly, 78% answered question 3 correctly and 89% answered question 4 correctly. It
seems that subjects found question 5 to be more difficult, since only 70% of them
answered it correctly.

Table 3 shows the randomization balance across treatments. Note that the same group
of 20 subjects was randomly matched to play 𝑇1 or 𝑇3 in odd-numbered rounds and
𝑇2 or 𝑇4 in even-numbered rounds. This enabled us to determine whether subjects
with given characteristics were more frequently allocated to one treatment over
another. In the comparisons among the four treatments, all characteristics and levels of
understanding of the game were perfectly balanced between 𝑇1 and 𝑇2 and between
𝑇3     and       𝑇4 .    In    some       cases,       there    were       slight        imbalances    in    terms     of
undergraduate/graduate students and nationality, mostly at a 5% significance level.
Nevertheless, we had to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% and 5% levels of statistical
significance in less than 10% of the tests. Moreover, the imbalances in nationality and
undergraduate/graduate students were due to the fact that there were very few
foreigners (95% of the subjects were Argentines) and very few graduates in the sample
(94% of the subjects were undergraduates).

5. Descriptive Analysis

In this section we first present descriptive statistics for the decisions taken by the
subjects (share of cooperators and payoffs by treatment). Then, we study the
distribution of the subjects’ prior beliefs regarding the share of expected cooperators.
Finally, we show that the average share of cooperators and average payoffs do not differ
between the sessions at which subjects were asked to report their prior beliefs and
those in which they were not asked to do so.



5.1. Cooperation decision. Table 4 provides descriptive statistics on the share of
cooperators for all subjects (first panel), the subset of subjects who were asked to report
their prior beliefs (second panel) and the subset of subjects who were not asked to
report their prior beliefs (third panel). For each treatment, Table 4 indicates the total
number of observations, sample means and standard deviations for the share of
cooperators, computed as the proportion of players out of the 10 participants who
decided to invest their point in each round, treatment and session. In order to facilitate
comparisons with theoretical predictions, we also report the model prediction for the
share of cooperators, assuming that the expected share of cooperators is uniformly


                                                            17
distributed and assuming the model prediction for the share of cooperators when the
empirical distribution of the expected share of cooperators is employed. As predicted by
the model, the average share of cooperators increases from 𝑇𝑗 to 𝑇𝑗+1 for 𝑗 = 1,2,3.
However, for all treatments, it exceeds the share predicted by the model either when
prior beliefs are assumed to be uniformly distributed or when the empirical distribution
of prior beliefs is employed. Note, however, that in the former case, the gap between the
observed average share of cooperators and theoretical predictions significantly
decreases for 𝑇2 , 𝑇3 , and 𝑇4 (by definition, the distribution of prior beliefs does not
affect theoretical predictions for 𝑇1 ).

     Note: For each treatment, there are 6 observations per session of the share of cooperators. Because we
     conducted 16 sessions, the total number of observations per treatment is 96.




5.2. Payoffs. Table 5 shows the sample mean and standard deviation of payoffs per
treatment. As predicted by the model, the payoff is, on average, higher in 𝑇𝑗+1 than in
𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1,2,3 (4.327 points in 𝑇4 , 3.294 points in 𝑇3 , 1.710 points in 𝑇2 and 1.019



                                                        18
points in 𝑇1 ), but in all treatments the average payoff exceeds the one predicted by the
model when prior beliefs are assumed to be uniformly distributed. Specifically, all
players earned, on average, 1.9% more than what the model predicted in 𝑇1 , 14% more
in 𝑇2 , 25.5% more in 𝑇3 and 23.6% more in 𝑇4 . The average payoff is very close to
theoretical predictions when the empirical distribution of prior beliefs is employed.
Specifically, all players earned, on average, 1.9% more than what the model predicted in
𝑇1 , 13.3% more in 𝑇2 , 11.7% more in 𝑇3 and 2% less than predicted by the model
in 𝑇4 .

          Note: For the payoffs in each treatment, there are 60 observations per session. Because we conducted
          16 sessions, the total number of observations per treatment is 960.




5.3. Prior beliefs. For each treatment, Table 6 gives descriptive statistics for the
subjects’ prior beliefs regarding the expected share of cooperators.15 Note that prior


15The reader will recall that, in randomly selected sessions, subjects were asked to estimate the expected
number of cooperators before they started playing.



                                                          19
beliefs differ across treatments.16 In particular, the expected share of cooperators is
higher in 𝑇𝑗+1 than in 𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1,2,3.

Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function of prior beliefs regarding the
expected share of cooperators across treatments. The horizontal axis measures how
many participants out of a group of 10 subjects believed would contribute their point in
each treatment. Let 𝐻 𝑗 denote the cumulative distribution function of prior beliefs for
treatment 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3, 4. Note that 𝐻 4 first order stochastically dominates 𝐻 3 and 𝐻 2
and that 𝐻 3 and 𝐻 2 first-order stochastically dominate 𝐻1 .




16 In line with this finding, Palfrey and Rosenthal (1991) show that subjects’ prior beliefs of the
probability that a subject contributes is biased up with respect to an unbiased Bayes-Nash equilibrium. In
the same vein, Orbell and Dawes (1991) argue that cooperators expect significantly more cooperation
than do defectors.

In order to formally compare the distribution functions of prior beliefs, we conduct the
nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pair sing-rank test. The null hypothesis of this test is
that the distribution of the prior belief for 𝑇𝑗 (denoted as 𝐻 𝑗 ) is equal to the
distribution of the prior belief for 𝑇𝑘 (denoted as 𝐻 𝑘 ) and the alternative hypothesis
is that 𝐻 𝑗 is shifted to the left of 𝐻 𝑘 . Table 7 shows the results of this test. Note that in
all cases except 𝑇2 vs 𝑇3 , the null hypothesis of equal distributions can be rejected at
0.17% of significance.17 Therefore, there is evidence that the distribution of prior
beliefs for 𝑇1 is shifted to the left of 𝑇2 , 𝑇3 , 𝑇4 , while the distribution of prior beliefs
for 𝑇2 is shifted to the left of 𝑇4 and the distribution of prior beliefs for 𝑇3 is shifted
to the left of 𝑇4 .




17 We use the Bonferroni correction to counteract the problem of 𝑑 multiple simultaneous comparisons.
The Bonferroni correction tests each individual hypothesis at a significance level of 𝛼/𝑑. Therefore, if we
test six hypotheses with a desired 𝛼 = 0.01, then the Bonferroni correction would test each individual
hypothesis at 𝛼 = 0.05/6 = 0.0017.

5.4. Reporting prior beliefs. The first panel (second panel) in Table 8 shows the results
of the difference in means test of the share of cooperators (payoffs) between the sample
composed by participants who reported their prior beliefs and those who did not report
them. Standard errors are clustered by session. Note that it is not possible to reject the
null hypothesis of equal means for the share of cooperators (payoff) in all treatments.

Summing up, the descriptive analysis shows that: (i) The average share of cooperators
increases from 𝑇𝑗 to 𝑇𝑗+1 for 𝑗 = 1,2,3; (ii) The average share of cooperators in all
treatments exceeds the share predicted by the model, but the gap is smaller once we
compute theoretical predictions using reported prior beliefs rather than the uniform
distribution; (iii) Payoffs are, on average, higher in 𝑇𝑗+1 than in 𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1,2,3; (iv)
Average payoffs exceed model predictions when prior beliefs are assumed to be
uniformly distributed, but they are closer to theoretical predictions when the empirical
distribution of prior beliefs is employed; (v) Prior beliefs differ across treatments. The
average expected share of cooperators is higher in 𝑇𝑗+1 than in 𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1,2,3. 𝐻 4
first-order stochastically dominates 𝐻 3 and 𝐻 2 , and 𝐻 3 and 𝐻 2 first-order
stochastically dominate 𝐻1 ; (vi) The average share of cooperators and the average
payoffs are not statistically different for the sessions in which subjects were asked to
report their prior beliefs than they are for the sessions in which they were not asked to
do so.



6. Results

In this section we formally test the main comparative static results using regression
analysis. Note that in the context of perfect experimental data, where no controls are
needed for identification of the causal effects of interest, the analysis is completely
nonparametric, as all that it entails is a comparison of the mean outcome differences


                                             23
across treatment groups, and the inference can also be made nonparametric. In all cases,
robust and clustered standard errors are computed by session.



6.1. Cooperation decision. In order to formally test the hypothesis that the probability
of a successful collective action increases with 𝐵 and 𝑠, we use the following
regression model:
                                                             16

                       𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑠 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝐷𝑇 + 𝛽2 𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑠 + ∑ 𝛽3 𝐷𝜃𝑠 +𝜀𝑖𝑝𝑠
                                                             𝑠=1

where 𝑖 indexes subjects, 𝑝 = 1, 2, 3, … ,12 indexes experimental rounds, and
𝑠 = 1, 2, 3, … ,16 indexes experimental sessions. 𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑠 is the dependent variable and
indicates whether player 𝑖 decided to invest his/her point in each session, round and
treatment (𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑠 = 1 if s/he contributes and 𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑠 = 0 if s/he does not). The
explanatory variable of interest is 𝐷𝑇, a dummy variable indicating treatment status (𝑇𝑗
for 𝑗 = 2, 3, 4). In some specifications, we also include control variables. We control for
individual characteristics 𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑠 (gender, age, nationality, university, whether or not the
subjects have ever taken a course in game theory, whether the subjects are
undergraduate or graduate students and the subjects’ level of understanding of the game
as measured by their answers to the quiz questions) and for fixed effects by session
(𝐷𝜃𝑠 ). According to our theoretical predictions, we should expect 𝛽̂1 to be positive
when comparing 𝑇𝑗+1 with 𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3.

Columns (1), (3) and (5) in Table 9 summarize the results of regressing 𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑟 in each
of the treatments separately without controls for all the subjects in the sample, those
subjects who reported their beliefs and those who did not report them, respectively.
Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses and standard errors clustered by
session are shown in square brackets. In keeping with the model’s prediction, the
probability of cooperators in each treatment is significantly different (at a confidence
level of 99% in most cases), and the coefficient associated with each treatment is
positive in all cases. Indeed, note that when we compare the probability of cooperation
in 𝑇4 vs. 𝑇1 , the associated coefficient is the highest.18 Thus, as predicted by the


18 The reader will recall that 𝑻𝟏 represents a scenario of no cooperation opportunities (𝑩 = 𝟏. 𝟐𝟓 and
𝒔 = 𝟎); in other words, this is the free-rider Olsonian model with one Nash equilibrium in which nobody

model, a higher value of 𝐵 and/or 𝑠 leads to a larger share of cooperators and, hence,
to a higher probability of cooperation. Columns (2), (4) and (6) in Table 9 report the
results once the entire set of controls is included. As the table shows, the results do not
change in any meaningful way.




contributes. 𝑻𝟒 represents a scenario where the incentives to cooperate are the highest (𝑩 = 𝟑 and
𝒔 = 𝟏. 𝟕𝟓).

6.2. Payoffs. In order to formally test the hypothesis that the average payoff of a player
increases with 𝐵 and/or 𝑠, we use the following regression model:
                                                                              11

                        𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑝𝑠 = γ + 𝛿1 𝐷𝑇 + 𝛿2 𝑋𝑖𝑝𝑠 + ∑ 𝛿3 𝐷𝜃𝑠 +𝜀𝑖𝑝𝑠
                                                                              𝑠=1



                                                             26
The dependent variable 𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑝𝑠 is the payoff denominated in points obtained by
subject 𝑖 in round 𝑝 and session 𝑠. The regressors are the same as in the model for
the share of cooperators. The explanatory variable of interest is 𝐷𝑇, a dummy variable
indicating treatment status (𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 2, 3, 4). According to our theoretical predictions,
we should expect 𝛿̂1 to be positive when comparing 𝑇𝑗+1 with 𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1,2,3.

Table 10 summarizes the results. The corresponding clustered standard errors are
shown in square brackets. As predicted by our model, the payoff in each treatment is
significantly different, and the coefficient associated with each treatment is positive.
Hence, operating under the parameters in 𝑇𝑗+1 rather than in 𝑇𝑗 for 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3
induces a positive and statistically significant effect on the payoff.

As a robustness check, we repeated the estimations in Tables 9 and 10 while introducing
two new explanatory variables, namely 𝐷𝑅 and 𝐼. 𝐷𝑅 is a dummy variable that
indicates whether the collective action in the previous round was successful or not, and
𝐼 is the number of players in the same group who decided to invest in the previous
round. These variables capture the possibility that subjects decide to cooperate in a



                                                            28
treatment just because either the collective action was successful in the previous round
or the number of investors was relatively high. The results do not change in any
meaningful way. The coefficients associated with each treatment are still significantly
different and positive



6.3. Prior beliefs. In order to determine if asking subjects to reveal their prior beliefs
biased their decisions during the game, we performed a test of equality of the regression
coefficients. Panel 1 of Table 11 summarizes the results of a test whose null hypothesis is
that the effects of each treatment on the share of cooperators are the same for the
subjects who reported their prior beliefs (𝛽1) and those who did not report them (𝛽1∗ ).
Standard errors are clustered by sessions. In all cases the null hypothesis of equal
coefficients cannot be rejected. Analogously, Panel 2 of Table 11 summarizes the results
of a test whose null hypothesis is that the effects of each treatment on the payoffs are
identical for subjects who reported their prior beliefs (𝛿1 ) and subjects who did not
report them (𝛿1∗ ). Standard errors are clustered by sessions. In all cases the null
hypothesis of equal coefficients cannot be rejected19. Thus, it is possible to confirm that
asking subjects to reveal their prior beliefs before the game started did not introduce
any bias in their decisions during the game.




19 The results of the tests hold when we add controls in the regression of the share of cooperators (and
payoffs) in each of the treatments. We do not report the corresponding 𝐹 statistics for the sake of
simplicity.

Summing up, the regression analysis produces robust support for the main theoretical
comparative statics predictions. Increases in 𝐵 and/or 𝑠 have a significant positive
effect on the share of cooperators and, hence, on the probability of a successful collective
action, as well as on the players’ payoffs.20 The effects are statistically significant
whether or not we include controls for individual characteristics, level of understanding
of the game or fixed effects by session. Asking subjects to report their prior beliefs
before the game started did not have any significant effect on their decisions.
Introducing control variables for whether the collective action in the previous round was
successful or not and for the number of players in the same group who decided to invest
in the previous round does not change the results in any meaningful way either.




20 More cooperative prior beliefs with the same 𝐵 and/or 𝑠 (i.e., within a treatment) do not, however,
induce more cooperation.

As discussed in section 5.3., the distribution of prior beliefs is not the same in every
treatment. As the benefit of cooperation increases, subjects tend to raise their
assessments of the share of cooperators. The effect of these changes in theoretical
predictions can be observed in Table 12. Except for 𝑻𝟏 , for which theoretical
predictions do not change with the distribution of prior beliefs, the predicted share of
cooperators increases for all of the rest of the treatments, as we employ the prior beliefs
                                         ̂ .21 For example, for 𝑻𝟐 , if we use the priors
associated with a treatment with a lower 𝜶
of 𝑻𝟏 , the predicted share of cooperators is 0.054, while it is 0.340 with the priors of
𝑻𝟐 , 0.448 with the priors of 𝑻𝟑 and 0.687 with the priors of 𝑻𝟒 . This suggests that we
can decompose a change in the predicted share of cooperators into two analytically
different effects: a ”belief effect” that captures the change in prior beliefs, and a ”range of
cooperation effect” that captures the change in the range of prior beliefs that induced
greater cooperation.

More technically, the distribution of the expected share of cooperators 𝑯 is not
               ̂ . Although this does not affect the sign of the comparative statics of the
independent of 𝜶
model, it is interesting to explore what fraction of the change in the predicted share of
cooperators can be attributed to a change in prior beliefs and what fraction can be
attributed to a change in the range of prior beliefs that induce greater cooperation. Thus,
                                                                        ̂ leads to a
we are now interested in detecting the mechanism by which a decrease in 𝜶
higher probability of a successful collective action.

Let 𝐻 𝑗 denote the cumulative distribution function of the expected share of
cooperators for treatment 𝑇𝑗 , and 𝑃𝑟 𝑗 the probability of a successful collective action
in treatment 𝑇𝑗 . Then:

    𝑃𝑟(𝑇𝑗 ) − 𝑃𝑟(𝑇𝑘 ) = 𝐻 𝑘 (𝛼̂𝑘 ) − 𝐻 𝑗 (𝛼̂𝑗 ) = [𝐻 𝑘 (𝛼̂𝑘 ) − 𝐻 𝑗 (𝛼̂𝑘 )] + [𝐻 𝑗 (𝛼̂𝑘 ) − 𝐻 𝑗 (𝛼̂𝑗 )]

                           𝐻 𝑘 (𝛼
                                ̂ )−𝐻 𝑗 (𝛼
                                         ̂ )
Define ∆𝐼 (𝑇𝑘 → 𝑇𝑗 ) = 𝐻 𝑘(𝛼̂𝑘 )−𝐻 𝑗(𝛼̂𝑘) . ∆𝐼 (𝑇𝑘 → 𝑇𝑗 ) as the proportion of the change
                                𝑘        𝑗

attributed to a change in the distribution of expected cooperators. Naturally,
1 − ∆𝐼 (𝑇𝑘 → 𝑇𝑗 ) is the proportion of the change in the probability of a successful
collective action due to a change in the range of prior beliefs that induce greater
cooperation. Table 13 shows the decomposition of a change in the predicted share of
cooperators into the belief and range of cooperation effects.

To some extent, this decomposition is arbitrary, in the sense that we can first vary 𝐻
and then 𝛼̂ or the other way around. Formally, we can also decompose 𝑃𝑟(𝑇𝑗 ) −
𝑃𝑟(𝑇𝑘 ) as follows:

    𝑃𝑟(𝑇𝑗 ) − 𝑃𝑟(𝑇𝑘 ) = 𝐻 𝑘 (𝛼̂𝑘 ) − 𝐻 𝑗 (𝛼̂𝑗 ) = [𝐻 𝑘 (𝛼̂𝑘 ) − 𝐻 𝑘 (𝛼̂𝑗 )] + [𝐻 𝑘 (𝛼̂𝑗 ) − 𝐻 𝑗 (𝛼̂𝑗 )]

Except when we move from 𝑇3 to 𝑇4 , both decompositions assign similar proportions
to both effects. When the starting point is 𝑇1 , both decompositions assign a very high
proportion of the change to the range of cooperation effect (at least 84%). When the
starting point is 𝑇2 and we move to 𝑇3 (𝑇4 ), the first and second decompositions
attribute 42% and 32.4% (61% and 70%) of the change to a switch in beliefs,
respectively.

A potential concern about these decompositions is that they rely on the empirical
distribution of prior beliefs that were reported by the subjects before the rounds began.
It is possible that these prior beliefs evolve as the experiment proceeds and that subjects
learn from previous rounds. However, we do not observe any temporal pattern in the
data. For example, Figure 2 shows the mean share of cooperators per round across
treatments for all the subjects in the sample (first panel), the subjects who reported
their beliefs (second panel) and the subjects who were not required to report their
beliefs (third panel). The mean share of cooperators fluctuates without forming any
clear pattern.

                               Note: Red diamonds denote the average values of the variable per treatment/round
                               within treatment. Blue bars indicate one standard deviation from the mean, calculated

                       Summing up, there are two mechanisms operating simultaneously that induce a higher
                       predicted share of cooperators. First, as 𝛼̂ decreases, subjects raise their assessments
                       of the expected share of cooperators (the belief effect). Second, given any distribution of
                       the assessments, a lower 𝛼̂ raises the assessments that induce subjects to contribute
                       (the range of cooperation effect). Except when we move from 𝑇3 to 𝑇4 , both
                       decompositions lead to similar results.



                       8. Conclusions

                       We have conducted a laboratory experiment in order to test the main implications of the
                       stability-sets methods as applied to collective action games. We have found strong
                       support for the key comparative static predictions of the theory. As we increase the
                       payoff of a successful collective action accruing to all players (𝐵) and only to those who
                       contribute (𝑠), the share of cooperators and payoffs both increase. As in many other
                       laboratory experiments, we found that subjects behave more cooperatively than is



                                                                                           35
predicted by the theory. But we have also shown that the gap between theoretical
predictions and observed behavior narrows significantly when we refine the theory by
allowing for a distribution of prior beliefs that varies with the parameters of the model.
Overall, the experiment indicates that the stability-sets method could be a very useful
tool for studying games with multiple equilibria.


The experiment also suggests a refinement of the theory. We found that, as the range of
cooperation increases, subjects upgrade their prior beliefs relating to the expected share
of cooperators. We have shown that if the new distribution of prior beliefs first-order
stochastically dominates the preceding one, then the signs of the comparative static
derivatives are not affected, but all effects are magnified. For practical purposes, this
refinement improves the power of the theory to predict the observed behavior.
Analytically, it allows us to decompose the mechanism that produces cooperation into a
”belief effect” and a ”range of cooperation effect”. Using our experiment, we have
computed these decompositions and have found evidence of the presence of both effects.
This may have interesting political economy implications. For example, a policy change
that affects the payoffs of a collective action game can produce a bigger change in the
likelihood of cooperation than what we would expect if we did not take the fact that
agents update the distribution of prior beliefs into account.


Understanding the logic of collective action is crucial in terms of political economy.
Explicitly or implicitly, collective action is a core component of many models of political
influence, political representation and coalition formation. A new approach to collective
action can produce significant impacts in terms of the way that we approach those
topics. To illustrate this point, consider the following examples. In the standard common
agency model of lobbying (Dixit, Grossman and Helpman, 1997 and Grossman and
Helpman, 2000), it is assumed that groups are either organized (meaning that the group
has solved the collective action problem and can lobby to advance its members’ common
interests) or unorganized. The stability-sets approach can serve as the basis for an
assessment of the likelihood that a group is organized as a function of structural
parameters that characterize the collective action problem of group organization. Thus,
by combining the common agency model of lobbying with the stability-sets approach to
collective action, we can build a more accurate theory of political influence. Another

interesting example is provided by Acemoglu’s and Robinson’s model of political regime
determination (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). This is a dynamic model in which, with
some exogenous probability, in every period a group with no de jure political power can
organize and obtain de facto political power. Again, combining this model with the
stability-sets approach to collective action can help us to refine the theory of political
transitions.

Schelling’s model: A Nash equilibrium is a profile 𝛼 such that, for all 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁, one
of the following conditions must hold:

                     𝑁−1
                       𝐵 + 𝑠(𝑘 + 1)
                     ∑[             − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≥ 0      and 𝛼𝑖 = 1                       (3)

                       𝐵 + 𝑠(𝑘 + 1)
                     ∑[             − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≤ 0      and 𝛼𝑖 = 0                       (4)
                            𝑁
                     𝑘=0


                 𝑁−1
                   𝐵 + 𝑠(𝑘 + 1)
                 ∑[             − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 0         and 𝛼𝑖 𝜖 (0,1)                    (5)
                        𝑁
                 𝑘=0

                                     𝑎
Where 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = ∑𝑎−𝑖 𝜖 𝑆(𝑘,𝑖) ∏𝑗≠𝑖 𝛼𝑗 𝑗 (1 − 𝛼𝑗 )1−𝑎𝑗 and 𝑆(𝑘, 𝑖) = {𝑎−𝑖 : ∑𝑗≠𝑖 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘}.

Lemma 1: If 𝛼𝑖 = 1 and 𝛼ℎ = 0, then 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 𝑃(𝑘 + 1, ℎ). Proof: Since players’
strategies are not correlated, the probability that 𝑘 + 1 players cooperate when we
exclude ℎ is equal to the probability that 𝑘 players cooperate when we exclude 𝑖
and ℎ times the probability that i cooperates plus the probability that 𝑘 + 1 players
cooperate excluding 𝑖 and ℎ times the probability that i does not cooperate. Formally,


                                              42
𝑃(𝑘 + 1, ℎ) = Pr (∑              𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 + 1)
                           𝑗≠ℎ



= Pr (∑           𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘) 𝛼𝑖 + Pr (∑             𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 + 1) (1 − 𝛼𝑖 )
          𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ                          𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ

= Pr (∑         𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1) 𝛼ℎ + Pr (∑               𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘) (1 − 𝛼ℎ )
          𝑗≠𝑖                                  𝑗≠𝑖



= Pr (∑         𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 )
          𝑗≠𝑖


The third line uses 𝛼𝑖 = 1. Again, since strategies are not correlated, the probability that
k players cooperate when we exclude i and h is equal to the probability that 𝑘 − 1
players cooperate when we exclude i times the probability that h cooperates plus the
probability that k players cooperate excluding i and h times the probability that h does
not cooperate. This justifies the fourth line. Finally, the last line is due to 𝛼ℎ = 0. ∎

Lemma 2: If 𝛼𝑖 > 𝛼ℎ and 𝑘 ≥ 1, then 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) ≥ 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖). Moreover, if there exist
𝑘 − 1 players different from 𝑖, ℎ for which 𝛼𝑗 > 0, then 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) > 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖). Proof:
Using the same argument we employed in Lemma 1 we have:


𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = Pr (∑           𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘)
                    𝑗≠𝑖



= Pr (∑           𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1) 𝛼ℎ + Pr (∑                 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 ) (1 − 𝛼ℎ )
          𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ                                  𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ

Analogously,


𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) = Pr (∑            𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘)
                    𝑗≠ℎ



= Pr (∑           𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1) 𝛼𝑖 + Pr (∑                𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘) (1 − 𝛼𝑖 )
          𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ                                 𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ


Therefore,


𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) − 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = (𝛼𝑖 − 𝛼ℎ ) [Pr (∑                  𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1) − Pr (∑            𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘)]
                                               𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ                          𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ

= (𝛼𝑖 − 𝛼ℎ ) Pr (∑             𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1) [1 − 𝛼𝑖 (1 − 𝛼ℎ ) − 𝛼ℎ (1 − 𝛼𝑖 )]

= (𝛼𝑖 − 𝛼ℎ ) Pr (∑             𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1) [(1 − 𝛼𝑖 )(1 − 𝛼ℎ ) + 𝛼𝑖 𝛼ℎ ]
                       𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ


The second line uses the fact that Pr (∑𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘) = Pr (∑𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1)[𝛼𝑖 (1 −
𝛼ℎ ) + 𝛼ℎ (1 − 𝛼𝑖 )] . By assumption (𝛼𝑖 − 𝛼ℎ ) > 0, Pr (∑𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1) ≥ 0 , and
1 − (1 − 𝛼𝑖 )(1 − 𝛼ℎ ) + 𝛼𝑖 𝛼ℎ > 0. Moreover, if there exist 𝑘 − 1 players different from
𝑖, ℎ for which 𝛼𝑗 > 0, then Pr ( ∑𝑗≠𝑖,ℎ 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑘 − 1) > 0 and, hence, 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) > 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖).
∎

Case 1 (all cooperate): Suppose that 𝛼𝑖 = 1 for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁. Then, 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≠ 0 if and
only if 𝑘 = 𝑁 − 1 and, hence, the Nash conditions become:

    𝐵 + 𝑠𝑁
[          − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑁 − 1, 𝑖) ≥ 0
      𝑁

Since 𝑠 > 𝑐, these conditions always hold. Therefore, 𝛼𝑖 = 1 for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁 is always
a Nash equilibrium.

Case 2 (nobody cooperates): Suppose that                          𝛼𝑖 = 0 for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁 . Then,
𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≠ 0 if and only if 𝑘 = 0 and, hence, the Nash conditions become:

    𝐵+𝑠
[       − 𝑐] 𝑃(0, 𝑖) ≤ 0
     𝑁
                                                 𝐵+𝑠                    𝐵+𝑠
These conditions hold if and only if 𝑁 ≥               . Thus, if 𝑁 ≥        , 𝛼𝑖 = 0 for all i is a Nash
                                                  𝑐                      𝑐

equilibrium.

Case 3 (some cooperate, some do not cooperate and some play a mixed strategy):
Suppose that there is a Nash equilibrium in which 𝑛1 players are cooperating, 𝑛2 are
playing a complete mixed strategy, and 𝑁 − 𝑛1 − 𝑛2 are not cooperating. Without loss
of generality, assume that 𝛼𝑖 = 1 for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛1 , 𝛼𝑖 𝜖 (0,1) for 𝑖 = 𝑛1 + 1, … , 𝑛2 ,
and 𝛼𝑖 = 0 for 𝑖 = 𝑛2 + 1, … , 𝑁. Then, for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛1 , we have 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≠ 0 if and
only if 𝑛1 − 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛2 − 1. Thus, the Nash conditions become:
    𝑛2 −1
            𝐵 + 𝑠 (𝑘 + 1)
    ∑ [                   − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≥ 0
                  𝑁
𝑘=𝑛1 −1




                                                   44
For 𝑖 = 𝑛1 + 1, … , 𝑛2 , we have 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≠ 0 if and only if 𝑛1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛2 − 1. Thus, the
Nash conditions become:
𝑛2 −1
   𝐵 + 𝑠 (𝑘 + 1)
∑ [              − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 0
         𝑁
𝑘=𝑛1


Finally, for 𝑖 = 𝑛2 + 1, … , 𝑁, we have 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≠ 0 if and only if 𝑛1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛2 . Thus, the
Nash conditions become:
 𝑛2
   𝐵 + 𝑠 (𝑘 + 1)
∑ [              − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≤ 0
         𝑁
𝑘=𝑛1


Arbitrarily select 𝑖 < 𝑛1 and 𝑛1 + 1 ≤ ℎ ≤ 𝑛2 . Then, 𝛼𝑖 = 1 and 𝛼ℎ = 0, and Lemma
1 implies that 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 𝑃(𝑘 + 1, ℎ). Therefore:
 𝑛2 −1                                   𝑛2 −1
     𝐵 + 𝑠 (𝑘 + 1)                    𝐵 + 𝑠 (𝑘 + 1)
 ∑ [               − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = ∑ [               − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘 + 1, ℎ)
           𝑁                                𝑁
𝑘=𝑛1 −1                                  𝑘=𝑛1−1

      𝑛2
           𝐵 + 𝑠𝑘
= ∑ [             − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ)
             𝑁
  𝑘=𝑛1


But, this leads to a contradiction, because the Nash condition for i implies that
           𝐵+𝑠𝑘                                                                      𝐵+𝑠(𝑘+1)

       [
                                                                            𝑛2
                  − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) ≥ 0, while the Nash condition for h implies ∑𝑘=𝑛  [              −
     1      𝑁                                                                  1        𝑁

𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) ≤ 0. Note that the argument does not depend on the existence of a group of

players who are playing a complete mixed strategy. In other words, if 𝑛2 = 𝑛1 , the same
argument holds. Hence, there cannot be a Nash equilibrium in which some players
cooperate with probability 1 and other players do not cooperate at all.

Case 4 (all play a mixed strategy): Suppose that 𝛼𝑖 𝜖 (0,1) for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁. Then
𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≠ 0 for all 𝑘. Thus, the Nash conditions become:
𝑁−1
        𝐵 + 𝑠 (𝑘 + 1)
∑[                    − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 0
              𝑁
𝑘=0

Since ∑𝑁−1
       𝑘=0 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 1, these conditions are equivalent to:

𝑁−1                  𝑁−1
                                   𝑐𝑁 − 𝐵 − 𝑠
∑ 𝑘 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = ∑ 𝑘 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) =

                                                  45
Arbitrarily select 𝑖 and ℎ and, without loss of generality, assume that 𝛼𝑖 > 𝛼ℎ . Then,
from Lemma 2, it must be the case that 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) > 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) for all 𝑘 ≥ 1. But this leads to
                                                        𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑠                               𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑠
a contradiction, because ∑𝑁−1
                          𝑘=1 𝑘 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) =                            and ∑𝑁−1
                                                                          𝑘=1 𝑘 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) =             cannot

simultaneously hold. Thus, in a Nash equilibrium in which all players are playing a
complete mixed strategy, it must be the case that 𝛼𝑖 = 𝛼̂ 𝜖 (0,1) for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁. In this
                   𝑁−1 𝑘
case, 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = (     ) 𝛼̂ (1 − 𝛼̂)𝑁−1−𝑘 , i.e. 𝑘~𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙 (𝑁 − 1, 𝛼̂ ). Therefore,
                    𝑘

𝑘=0

               𝑐𝑁 − 𝐵 − 𝑠
𝛼̂(𝑁 − 1) =
                   𝑠

The last line uses the fact that the expected value of 𝑘~𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙 (𝑁 − 1, 𝛼̂ ) is
                                     𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑠
𝛼̂(𝑁 − 1). Therefore, 𝛼̂ =                     . Note that 𝑠 > 𝑐 implies that 𝛼̂ < 1, while 𝛼̂ > 0 if
                                      𝑠(𝑁−1)
                    𝐵+𝑠                             𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑠
and only if 𝑁 >                 . Thus, 𝛼𝑖 = 𝛼̂ =                for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁 is a Nash equilibrium if
                        𝑐                           𝑠(𝑁−1)

Case 5 (some cooperate and some play a mixed strategy): Suppose that there is a
Nash equilibrium in which 𝑛1 players are cooperating and 𝑁 − 𝑛1 are playing a
complete mixed strategy. Without loss of generality, assume that 𝛼𝑖 = 1 for
𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛1 and 𝛼𝑖 𝜖 (0,1) for 𝑖 = 𝑛1 + 1, … , 𝑁 . Then, for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛1 , the Nash

Using the same argument that we employed to prove that if, in a Nash equilibrium, all
players are playing a mixed strategy, they must play the same strategy, we can prove
that in a Nash equilibrium 𝛼𝑖 = 𝛼̃ for all 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛1 . As a consequence, 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) =
 𝑁 − 𝑛1 − 1 𝑘−𝑛1
(          ) 𝛼̃  (1 − 𝛼̃)𝑁−1−𝑘 and, therefore:

This implies that:

                                           𝑁 − 𝑛1
For 𝑖 = 𝑛1 + 1, … , 𝑁 we have 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = (          ) 𝛼̃ 𝑘−𝑛1 +1 (1 − 𝛼̃)𝑁−𝑘−1 . Therefore:
                                         𝑘 − 𝑛1 + 1

This implies:

                        𝑐𝑁−𝐵−(1+𝑛1 )𝑠               𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑛1 𝑠
Since 𝑠 > 𝑐, 𝛼̃ =                        and 𝛼̃ ≥               never hold simultaneously.

is a Nash equilibrium in which 𝑛2 are playing a complete mixed strategy and 𝑁 − 𝑛2
are not cooperating. Without loss of generality assume 𝛼𝑖 𝜖 (0,1) for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛2 , and
𝛼𝑖 = 0 for 𝑖 = 𝑛2 + 1, … , 𝑁 . Then, for 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛2                  we have 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≠ 0 for
0 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛2 − 1. Thus, the Nash conditions become:

𝑛2 −1
  𝐵 + 𝑠 (𝑘 + 1)
∑[              − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 0
        𝑁
𝑘=0

Since ∑𝑁−1
       𝑘=0 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 1, these conditions are equivalent to:

𝑛2 −1             𝑛2 −1
                                        𝑐𝑁 − 𝐵 − 𝑠
∑ 𝑘𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = ∑ 𝑘𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) =
                                            𝑠
𝑘=0               𝑘=1




                                                     47
For 𝑖 = 𝑛2 + 1, … , 𝑁 we have 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≠ 0 for 0 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛2 . Thus, the Nash conditions
become:

𝑛2
  𝐵 + 𝑠 (𝑘 + 1)
∑[              − 𝑐] 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≤ 0
        𝑁
𝑘=0

Since ∑𝑁−1
       𝑘=0 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = 1, these conditions are equivalent to:

𝑛2             𝑛2
                             𝑐𝑁 − 𝐵 − 𝑠
∑ 𝑘𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) = ∑ 𝑘𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖) ≤
                                 𝑠
𝑘=0           𝑘=1

Arbitrarily select 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛2 and ℎ > 𝑛2 . Then, from Lemma 2, we have 𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) > 𝑃(𝑘, 𝑖)
                               𝑛2 −1               𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑠
for all 𝑘 ≥ 1 , which implies ∑𝑘=1   𝑘𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) ≥             . However, this leads to a
                                                      𝑠
                       𝑛2 −1              𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑠        𝑛2               𝑐𝑁−𝐵−𝑠
contradiction because ∑𝑘=1   𝑘𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) ≥            and ∑𝑘=1 𝑘𝑃(𝑘, ℎ) ≤            cannot
                                             𝑠                             𝑠

hold simultaneously. ∎

Online Appendix 2. Description of the Experiment

In this appendix we present the script for the general instructions, the instructions given
to the participants, the quiz and the questionnaire.



Appendix 2.1. Script for General Instructions

We would like to welcome everyone to this experiment. This is an experiment in
decision-making, and you will be paid for your participation, in cash, at the end of the
experiment. Different subjects may earn different amounts. What you earn depends
partly on your decisions, partly on the decisions of others and partly on chance.

The entire experiment will be conducted through computer terminals, and all
interaction between participants will take place through the computers. It is very
important for you not to talk or to try to communicate with other subjects during the
experiment in any way.

At your workstation, you will find a pencil, a paper with instructions and scratch paper.
During the experiment you can use the scratch paper to make calculations.

We will now start with a brief instruction period. During this period, you will be given a
complete description of the experiment. If you have any questions during the instruction
period, please raise your hand and your question will be answered so that everyone can
hear the response. If any difficulties arise after the experiment has begun, raise your
hand, and one of the persons conducting the experiment will come to assist you.

You are one of 20 students who have been asked to participate in this experiment. In
each round you will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, consisting of 10 persons
each. Then, you will play a computer game, which will appear on the screen, with the
other members of that same group. At the beginning of each round, the parameters of
the game will appear on the screen, as will the timing. At the end of the round, you will
be informed of the result of the game, the points you have earned and the points that you
have accumulated so far. In the next round, all players will again be randomly assigned
to one of the two new groups of 10 people each.

The experiment you are participating in is broken down into four unpaid practice
rounds and twelve separate paid rounds. At the end of the last round, you will be paid



                                            49
the total amount you have accumulated during the course of the last twelve rounds. Your
profit is denominated in POINTS. Your PESO profit is determined by multiplying your
earnings in points by a conversion rate. In this experiment, the conversion rate is 2
pesos to 1 point.22 Everyone will be paid in private and you are under no obligation to
tell others how much you earned.

Please read the instructions that you will find on your desktop carefully. You have 10
minutes. Please, remember that if you have any questions, you should ask them aloud.



Appendix 2.2. Instructions

1. In each round you receive ONE point. You can keep it for yourself or invest it in a
common fund. You have 90 seconds to make your decision. When you select an option,
please press the "Next" button. If, after 90 seconds, you have not selected an option, the
computer will randomly do it for you.

2. Once all players have taken a decision, the outcome of the game will appear on the
screen: If the investment is successful, each of the ten players will receive 𝐵 points, and
those who have decided to invest their point will receive 𝑠 additional points. If the
investment fails, nobody gets a profit, and those who have decided to invest their point
will lose the point that they initially invested.

Therefore:

        If you have decided to invest your point in the common fund and the investment
         is successful, you will accumulate 𝐵 + 𝑠 points;
        If you have decided to keep your point for yourself and the investment is
         successful, you will accumulate 𝐵 + 1 points;
        If you have decided to invest your point in the common fund and the investment
         fails, you will earn 0 points;
        If you have decided to keep your point for yourself and the investment fails, you
         will earn 1 point.




22 The conversion rate was adjusted by inflation (20% since August). Hence, starting in August, the rate
was adjusted to 2.4 pesos for 1 point. At that stage, 2 and 2.4 Argentine pesos were equivalent to
approximately 0.25 and 0.28 dollars, respectively.


                                                  50
3. The probability of success of the investment depends on the proportion of players in
your group who have decided to invest:

                                            (Number of players who invested their point)
      Successful investment probability =
                                                                10

Thus, the greater the number of players who have decided to invest their point, the
greater is the probability that the investment will be successful.

For example, if 6 out of 10 participants choose to invest their point in the common fund,
the chances of success are 60%. If the investment is successful, those six participants
will get 𝐵 + 𝑠, and the remaining four will obtain 𝐵 + 1. However, if the investment
fails, the six participants who decided to invest their point get 0 units, while the
remaining four get 1 point.

Let us suppose that, in another case, only 2 out of 10 players decide to invest their points
in the common fund. Therefore, the chances of success are 20%. If the investment is
successful, those two participants will get 𝐵 + 𝑠, and the remaining eight will obtain
𝐵 + 1. However, if the investment fails, the two participants who decided to invest their
point will get 0 units, while the remaining eight will get 1 point.

At the end of each round, you will be told how many players have decided to invest their
point in the common fund, whether the investment was successful or not, the gain in the
round, and the total amount of points accumulated from the fifth round onward. To end
the round, you will need to press the "Next" button.

At the beginning of the next round, you will be randomly assigned to a new group. Pay
attention because the parameters of the game may have changed. That is, in each round,
𝐵 and / or 𝑠 may vary.

After the sixteenth, round you will be asked to answer a few questions about you.
Finally, when you click "Finish", the screen will display a WORD. It is IMPORTANT to
remember this word because you have to present this password to the person who was
running the experiment in order to receive your payoff.



Appendix 2.3. Belief Questions

The following script provides a sample of the questions that subjects were asked about
their beliefs before starting the game.


                                               51
Screen: Before you begin to play, we would like to ask you some questions about the
experiment. These questions are for information purposes only, and there is no right or
wrong answer. You will not be paid for answering them.

1. Suppose that 𝐵 = 1.25 and 𝑠 = 0: How many players out of a group of 10 persons
do you think will invest their point in the common fund? [11 options].

2. Suppose that 𝐵 = 1.25 and 𝑠 = 1.25: How many players out of a group of 10
persons do you think will invest their point in the common fund? [11 options].

3. Suppose that 𝐵 = 3 and 𝑠 = 1.25: How many players out of a group of 10 persons
do you think will invest their point in the common fund? [11 options].

4. Suppose that 𝐵 = 3 and 𝑠 = 1.75: How many players out of a group of 10 persons
do you think will invest their point in the common fund? [11 options].



Appendix 2.4. The Quiz

After a general explanation of the rules of the game, subjects took the following quiz:

1. Suppose the following parameters of the game: 𝐵 = 2 and 𝑠 = 0. If all players,
including you, decide NOT to invest their point in the common fund and the investment
fails, how many points do you obtain at the end of this round? [5 options]

2. Suppose the following parameters of the game: 𝐵 = 2 and 𝑠 = 1. If all players,
including you, decide to invest their point in the common fund and the investment is
successful, how many points do you get at the end of this round? [5 options]

3. Consider the following two possible games:

      First game: 𝐵 = 3 and 𝑠 = 1;
      Second game: 𝐵 = 4 and 𝑠 = 1;

If you decide NOT to invest your point and the investment fails, in which of the two
games do you accumulate more points? [3 options]

4. If there are 10 players and 8 of them decide to invest their point, what is your best
option if the parameters of the game are: 𝐵 = 0.5 and 𝑠 = 2? [3 options]

5. If there are 10 players and 4 of them decide to invest their point, what is your best
option if the parameters of the game are: 𝐵 = 1 and 𝑠 = 1? [3 options]


                                            52
