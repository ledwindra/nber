Unsticking the Flypaper Effect in an Uncertain World

ABSTRACT
We provide a novel explanation for the flypaper effect based on insurance arguments. In our model,
the flypaper effect arises due to the differential response of precautionary savings to private income
or fiscal transfers shocks in an uncertain world with incomplete markets. The model generates two
testable implications: (i) the flypaper effect is a decreasing function of the correlation between fiscal
transfers and private income, and (ii) such relationship is stronger the higher is the volatility of fiscal
transfers and/or private income. An empirical analysis of Argentinean provinces for the period 19632006 finds strong support for the model's implications.

The ypaper e¤ect results when a dollar of exogenous grant-in-aid leads to significantly greater public spending than an equivalent dollar of citizen income: Money
sticks where it hits. Viewing governments as agents for a representative citizen
voter, this empirical result is an anomaly.
Robert Inman (2008)

Introduction

The ypaper e¤ect is a widely-documented empirical regularity in public nance that holds
that the propensity of subnational governmental units to spend out of intergovernmental
unconditional scal transfers (hereafter, scal transfers) is higher than the propensity to spend
out of private income. According to Inman (2008), 3,500 research papers have documented
this stylized fact for numerous countries and levels of government in the world. These studies
show that while an extra dollar in private income increases public spending by $0.02-$0.05,
an equivalent increase in scal transfers triggers a rise in spending that lies between $0.25 and
$1.3. The term ypaper e¤ect was coined in early papers that uncovered this stylized fact
(Henderson, 1968; Gramlich, 1969). This catchy expression captures the idea that money
sticks where it hits: money in the private sector (i.e., from private income) tends to be
allocated to private consumption rather than being taxed away, while money in the public
sector (i.e., from scal transfers) tends to be spent by the public sector rather than being
rebated back to citizens.
As Inmans quote illustrates, the ypaper e¤ect has been regarded as a puzzle or an
anomaly. This is indeed the case if one thinks in terms of a model in which a representative
citizen maximizes her utility subject to her total income  composed by the sum of private
income and her share of scal transfers. Such a model would predict an identical propensity
to spend out of private income or scal transfers. After all, money is fungible and the source
of nancing should not a¤ect the optimal allocation of resources.
Explanations for the ypaper e¤ect have abounded and can be divided into ve di¤erent
groups, two of them pointing to potential speci cation errors and the remaining three based
on theoretical arguments. A rst group of explanations argues that non-fungible conditional
scal transfers, like the ones American states receive from matching grants, are misclassi ed
as unconditional ones. A second group holds that omitted variables could also falsely support the ypaper e¤ect if unobserved community characteristics, which a¤ect the technology
or e¤ective cost of public spending, were systematically related with citizens private income
(Hamilton, 1983). Knight (2002) also argues that the omitted variable could reect an unobserved preference for the targeted local public good (in his case public spending in highways).

2

The ypaper puzzle, however, remains after using truly unconditional grants (Inman, 1971;
Gramlich and Galper, 1973; Bowman, 1974) or controlling for population characteristics. A
third group holds that the choice model of the representative citizen might be misspeci ed
because the citizen confuses the income e¤ect generated by scal transfers with a price e¤ect
that reduces the average e¤ective cost of public spending (Courant et al, 1979; Oates, 1979), is
not fully informed and fails to see the public budget (Filimon et al, 1982) or, even when fully
informed, might not behave completely rationally (Hines and Thaler, 1995). Building upon
bureaucratic capture, Lutz (2010) shows that the ypaper e¤ect tends to vanish in a setting
with a strong presumption that public good provision decisions reect the preferences of voters (i.e., direct democracy). In a related paper, Strumpf (1998) argues that one shortcoming
of the ypaper e¤ect literature is that it presumes all communities have an identical propensity to consume from an intergovernmental grant. He shows that the ypaper e¤ect should
be more important in high overhead communities (which implies a lower provision of public
services and a stronger role for revenue-maximizing forces in the budget-setting process). A
fourth group uses political science arguments that exploit the role that ine¢cient political institutions have in revealing citizens preferences (Chernick, 1979). A fth group relies on real
collection costs (Hamilton, 1986; Aragón, 2009) or distortionary taxation arguments (Vegh
and Vuletin, 2013).
This paper provides a novel additional explanation for the ypaper e¤ect based on insurance arguments. Consider an uncertain world with incomplete markets in which a subnational unit (hereafter, province) has two stochastic sources of income: private income and
scal transfers. In such a world, how will government spending react to an increase in scal
transfers relative to an increase in private income?1 We show that the answer depends on (i)
how each shock a¤ects the variance of total income and (ii) how precautionary savings react
to the change in the variance of total income.
To understand the basic intuition behind our results, consider, as a benchmark, the extreme case in which the variance of private income and scal transfers is the same and the
correlation is one. In such a case, both sources of income are identical in terms of risk. Since
either shock will increase the variance of total income by the same amount, precautionary
savings will increase by the same amount and, therefore, government spending will rise by
the same amount in response to either shock. In other words, the ypaper e¤ect is zero. In
fact, in this case of perfect positive correlation, our stochastic model reduces to the standard
static model with no uncertainty because the stochastic structure is such that scal transfers
do not provide any insurance.
1

By increase in either scal transfers or private income, we mean an increase in their expected value.

3

Suppose now that the correlation between private income and scal transfers is zero. In
this case,

scal transfers are providing some insurance to the province because it now has

two uncorrelated sources of income. Suppose also that, as is the case in practice, the share
of scal transfers in total income is less than half (i.e., private income represents the main
source of total income). An increase in private income will then raise the variance of total
income by more than the same increase in scal transfers because an increase in private income
raises the share of private income in total income but an equivalent increase in scal transfers
reduces it.

In other words, from a portfolio point of view, an increase in private income

decreases diversi cation, while an increase in scal transfers increases diversi cation.2 As a
result, precautionary savings will increase by more in the case of an increase in private income
than in the case of an increase in scal transfers. This implies that overall spending will be
higher in response to an increase in scal transfers than in response to an increase in private
income.

Since overall spending is allocated to both private and government consumption,

government spending increases by more in response to an increase in

scal transfers than

in response to an increase in private income (i.e., the ypaper e¤ect is positive). In sum,
our model rationalizes a positive ypaper e¤ect as the result of two non-perfectly correlated
sources of income a¤ecting the variance of total income di¤erently and thus leading to di¤erent
reactions in precautionary savings and hence of government spending. The only key friction
is the assumption of incomplete markets.
In addition to o¤ering a new theoretical take on the ypaper e¤ect, our model yields
two testable empirical implications.

First, the ypaper e¤ect is a decreasing function of

the correlation between private income and federal transfers.

Intuitively, the lower the

correlation between private income and scal transfers, the more diversi ed is the provinces
income portfolio and thus the larger the di¤erence in precautionary saving in response to an
increase in private income relative to scal transfers.

Second, the e¤ect of the correlation

on the ypaper e¤ect becomes stronger the higher is the volatility of private income and/or
transfers. Intuitively, the larger the variance of the provinces income portfolio, the riskier
the portfolio is, and hence the larger the di¤erence in precautionary saving in response to an
increase in private income relative to scal transfers.
We test these two predictions of the model by using a dataset for Argentinean provinces.
After addressing the possible endogeneity of grants, our empirical ndings for Argentinean
provinces support the two theoretical implications described above and show that the proposed
2

Remember from basic portfolio theory that if a portfolio is comprised of two uncorrelated sources of income
with equal variances, the total variance is minimized if each source represents one half of the portfolio. Of
course, while in portfolio theory the shares of di¤erent assets is chosen optimally, the provinces take as given
these shares.

mechanism explains about 12 percent of the overall ypaper e¤ect observed.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops our theoretical contribution. Turning
to the empirical evidence, Section 3 describes basic background information on Argentina that
will prove critical in understanding the nature and determinants of scal transfers from the
federal government to provinces as well as the identi cation strategy proposed in Section 4 to
deal with endogeneity considerations. Section 5 documents the presence of the ypaper e¤ect
in Argentinean provinces, after controlling for endogeneity concerns, various other possible
determinants of scal spending, as well as for provincial and year xed-e¤ects. We then test,
and nd strong support for our two key empirical implications in Section 6.

Concluding

remarks are presented in Section 7.

A simple model of insurance

The ypaper e¤ect literature has traditionally relied on a standard one-period model to describe the ypaper e¤ect as an anomaly (e.g., Henderson, 1968; Gramlich, 1969; Knight, 2002;
Inman, 2008). In the typical model  spelled out in appendix 8.2.1  a representative citizen (RC) maximizes her utility, which depends on private consumption (c) and government
spending (g), subject to her total income, which is the sum of her private income y and her
share of scal transfers f . In this context, de ne the ypaper e¤ect (F P ) as
F P  4g f

4g y ;

(1)

where 4g y and 4g f denote the change in government spending in response to an increase of
one dollar in private income or scal transfers, respectively. As shown in the appendix 8.2.1,
in this model F P = 0. In other words, the optimal allocation of resources does not depend
on the source of nancing. In particular, the propensity to spend on g does not depend on
whether additional resources come in the form of private income or scal transfers.
This section o¤ers a new theoretical explanation based on macroeconomic insurance arguments. We develop a two-period model with uncertainty and incomplete markets.3 After
discussing the stochastic structure of income, we derive a reduced-form expression for the ypaper e¤ect and show that, in the presence of incomplete markets, the model can rationalize
a positive ypaper e¤ect. The model also generates some key theoretical implications that
will allow us to take our model to the data in the following section.
3

It is straightforward to show that the ypaper remains zero in a two-period model under certainty or
uncertainty with complete markets (see appendices 8.2.2 and 8.2.3).

2.1

Stochastic structure of income

Consider a small open economy perfectly integrated into world goods markets.

Capital

markets are incomplete in the sense that there is only an international risk-free bond available.
In period 1 there is no uncertainty, and private income and scal transfers are given by y1
and f1 , respectively. In the second period, private income and scal transfers are uncertain
and given by
y1 = y + sy ;

(2)

y2 = (y + sy ) (1 + "y ) ;

(3)

f1 = f + sf ;

(4)

f2 =



f + sf (1 + "f ) ;

(5)

where y and f are initial (i.e., pre-shock) levels of private income and scal transfers, respectively, and sy and sf denote the shocks to private income and scal transfers, respectively.
To evaluate the e¤ects of a shock to private income and scal transfers, we consider an initial
equilibrium characterized by sy = sf = 0. The terms "y and "f represent mean-preserving
spreads of each dollar the RC receives as private income and scal transfers, respectively.




We assume that "y  N 0;  2"y , "f  N 0;  2"f and that "y and "f are jointly normally
distributed, where  2"y and  2"f are the variances of "y and "f , respectively. The parameter 
is the correlation between "y and "f .4 If  2"y =  2"f = 0, there is, of course, no uncertainty.
A shock to private income consists of an increase in sy such that 4y1 = 4E [y2 ] = 1
(i.e., sy = 1), while a shock to scal transfers consists of an increase in sf such that 4f1 =
4E [f2 ] = 1 (i.e., sf = 1). In other words, second-period private income and scal transfers
increase, in expected value, by the same amount as they do in the rst period.5 This structure
of shocks allows us to keep constant the coe¢cient of variation before and after the shock.6
This is a desirable feature as it maintains constant the relative volatility of private income
and scal transfers before and after the shock.
4

Note that this implies that the correlation between y2 and f2 is also .
In line with the literature on the ypaper e¤ect and, more importantly, in order to have analytical solutions,
we model private income and scal transfer shocks as permanent (i.e., they occur in both periods).
This
implies, of course, that total savings equal precautionary savings since there is no motive to save based on
consumption smoothing. Our main results would not change if shocks were assumed to be temporary in a
multi-period or in nite horizon framework.

Recall that the coe cient of variation (cv) is de ned as cv  standard deviation/expected value. For our
two random variables y2 and f2 ; cvy2 =  "y and cvf2 =  "f .

) x;

(7)

where x  y + f . Thus,  represents the proportion of initial (i.e., pre-shock) total income
corresponding to private income and 1

 the proportion corresponding to scal transfers.

While, in theory,  2 [0; 1], in practice 1 >  > 0:5. In other words, private income represents
the largest fraction of total income.7 Henceforth, we will assume that 1 >  > 0:5, which is
equivalent to assuming that y > f .

The RCs intertemporal total income constraint for each possible realization of "y and "f

The RC chooses c1 , c2 ("y ; "f ), g1 , and g2 ("y ; "f ) to maximize (8) subject to constraint

Fiscal transfers as a share of gross subnational product average 12 percent for Argentinean provinces,
ranging from 3 percent in Buenos Aires to 32 percent in Formosa.
8
The CARA function has two key properties in the presence of uncertainty and incomplete markets. First,
the third derivative is positive, which will generate precautionary savings. Second, it will enable us to obtain
reduced-form solutions.

 (1

)= is

between zero and one, given the assumption that 1 >  > 0:5.
Based on expression (10), we can derive three propositions.

Proposition 1 provides a

conceptual benchmark, while Propositions 2 and 3 o¤er refutable hypotheses that we will
take to the data.
Proposition 1 Assume that shocks to private income and
variance (i.e.,  2"y =  2"f ).

scal transfers have the same

Then the ypaper e¤ect is zero for  = 1 and positive for any

 < 1.
Proof. Setting  2"y =  2"f and  = 1 in (10) implies that F P = 0. Since the partial derivative
with respect to  is negative, F P > 0 for any  < 1.
Figure 1, which plots the ypaper e¤ect as a function of  for the case of equal variances,
illustrates this proposition.9 Intuitively, when  = 1, both sources of income are identical in
terms of risk. Either shock will increase the variance of total income by the same amount
and, therefore, government spending will rise by the same amount in response to either shock.
The ypaper e¤ect is thus zero (point A in Figure 1).
Suppose now that the correlation between the two shocks is zero (Point B in Figure 1). In
this case, scal transfers are providing some insurance to the province because it now has two
uncorrelated sources of income. Since, by assumption, the share of scal transfers in total
income is less than half, an increase in private income will raise the variance of total income by
more than the same increase in scal transfers because an increase in private income raises the
share of private income in total income but an equivalent increase in scal transfers reduces
it.

In other words, from a portfolio point of view, an increase in private income decreases

diversi cation, while an increase in scal transfers increases it.

As a result, precautionary

savings will increase by more in the case of an increase in private income than in the case of
an increase in scal transfers. This implies that overall spending will be higher in response to
an increase in scal transfers than in response to an increase in private income. Since overall
spending is allocated to both private and government consumption, government spending
increases by more in response to an increase in scal transfers than in response to an increase
in private income (i.e., the ypaper e¤ect is positive).
Finally, consider the case in which  =

1, which corresponds to point C in Figure 1. At

that point, the ypaper e¤ect reaches it maximum value because the two sources of income
are perfectly negatively correlated and diversi cation is therefore at its peak.
9

An increase

If variances are not the same, then the ypaper e¤ect is not zero when  = 1. In fact, the ypaper e¤ect
will be positive for  = 1 as long as the variance of private income is larger than the variance of scal transfers.
Propositions 2 and 3 do not depend on variances being equal.

8

in private income will thus lead to a large amount of precautionary saving compared to an
increase in scal transfers.
Proposition 2 The ypaper e¤ect is a decreasing function of the correlation between private
income and scal transfers.
Proof. Follows immediately from expression (10) by taking the derivative with respect to
.10
Figure 1, of course, illustrates this proposition for the particular case of equal variances
even though the result holds for any value of the variances.

Intuitively, as the correlation

between the two shocks decreases, scal transfers provide more diversi cation.

The more

diversi ed the income portfolio, the lower the response of precautionary saving (i.e., the larger
the increase in government spending) in response to an increase in scal transfers relative to
an increase in private income.
Proposition 3 The relationship described in Proposition 2 is stronger the higher is the
volatility of private income and/or scal transfers.
Proof. Consider the partial derivative of expression (10) with respect to , and further
di¤erentiate with respect to (i)  "y , (ii)  "f and (iii) both  "y and  "f .
In terms of Figure 1 (i.e., for the case of equal variances), we can think of the curve
pivoting upwards around point A as variances increase, so that for any given value of , the
ypaper e¤ect becomes larger. Intuitively, the higher are the variances (i.e., the riskier is the
income portfolio), the larger is the increase in precautionary saving in response to an increase
in private income relative to scal transfers.

Argentina: Fiscal background11

We will test our theoretical model using a perfectly-balanced dataset on subnational income,
total spending, and scal transfers for all of 23 Argentinean provinces for the period 19632006.12

As a prelude, this section provides some basic background on Argentinas

This section builds upon Porto (1990, 2003, and 2004), Porto and Sanquinetti (1993), Núñez Miñana
(1998), and Sturzenegger and Werneck (2006). See also appendix 8.3.1 for further details.

See the appendix 8.3.1 for demographic and economic information on Argentinean provinces. Like other
papers in this literature (e.g., Porto and Sanguinetti, 2001), we exclude the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires
from the analysis due to both short data availability and its special status in terms of the system of scal
transfers.

structure that will prove critical in understanding the nature and determinants of scal transfers from the federal government to provinces as well as the identi cation strategy proposed
in Section 4 to deal with endogeneity concerns.
Argentina is a federal constitutional republic and representative democracy.

It has a

multi-party system with two main political parties (Partido Justicialista, PJ, and Unión Cívica
Radical, UCR), and about 20 other smaller provincial parties that have had representation
in the National Congress and 15 provincial governments. During the last two-thirds of the
twentieth century, the country faced severe political instability and was ruled by military
regimes between 1966-1972 and 1976-1983.
Each province has the constitutional power to run an autonomous scal policy. The size
of the overall government, measured by the ratio of consolidated government expenditure to
GDP, averages 35 percent of GDP. Government spending is highly decentralized; on average,
Argentinean provinces are responsible for about 40 percent of consolidated scal spending.
On the other hand, tax collection is highly centralized at the federal level. These vertical
imbalances are nanced by a system of intergovernmental scal transfers from the federal
government which represent, on average, about 60 percent of provincial expenditure.
The most important component of intergovernmental transfers (about 65 percent) is based
on a tax-sharing law called coparticipación which dates from 1935. Such tax-sharing law
established: (i) the taxes to be shared (most direct and indirect domestic taxes), (ii) how
shared tax collection would be distributed between the federal government and provinces
(which is referred as primary distribution), and (iii) how provincial funds would be distributed between provinces (which is referred as secondary distribution). It is important to
note that these scal transfers from federally-collected taxes to provinces are unconditional
(and automatic) in the sense that, by law, provinces are entitled to them based on their mere
existence.
Periodically, typically every ten years to allow the system to adjust, new modifying laws
were enacted to regulate the primary and secondary distribution of funds. The tax-sharing
law established that secondary shares were to be determined using formulas that weighed
various time-varying indicators such as each provinces contribution to total tax collection
(proxied by population), cost of providing public goods (proxied by population density), and
redistributive considerations favoring low income provinces. Since 1988, primary distribution
coe¢cients have not changed and secondary distribution coe¢cients have been xed and not
determined by any explicit formula.
Other intergovernmental transfers (about 35 percent) are discretionary in nature and
have typically responded to political factors. Speci cally, these transfers have been used by

10

the federal government (i) in exchange for support of provincial legislators in the National
Congress for laws and reforms pushed by the federal government and (ii) to favor politicallyprotected provinces.13

4

Endogeneity concerns and identi cation strategy

As just discussed, Argentinas scal structure exhibits a key feature that proves to be particularly useful for our study:

scal transfers from the federal government to provinces are

essentially unconditional in nature (i.e., they are not a direct function of provincial spending).14 While necessary, the unconditionality of scal transfers is not su¢cient to guarantee
exogeneity. This section discusses these endogeneity problems and provides an identi cation
strategy to address them.

4.1

Endogeneity problems.

As just mentioned, unconditionality is not su¢cient to ensure that scal transfers are truly
exogenous to provincial spending.

The reasons are twofold. First, while the secondary

shares for coparticipated funds have been xed since 1988 (thus ensuring exogeneity relative
to provincial spending), this was not the case before 1988. If formulas for secondary shares
before 1988 reected, for instance, redistributive considerations, we could have endogeneity
problems to the extent that low-income provinces with a strong preference to spend on low
income households in bad times could have gotten more funds in bad times. In such cases,
more coparticipated funds would not have caused more provincial spending but instead
accommodated an already-existing preference to redistribute in bad times.
Second, total scal transfers (the variable that we use in our regressions) include about 35
percent of non-coparticipated and discretionary funds. While unconditional, we cannot rule
out that lobbying from congressional representatives of provinces with, for example, a strong
preference to spend could have succeeded in getting more funds for their respective provinces.
Again, in this case, larger transfers would not be causing more provincial spending but
13

For instance, Centrangolo and Jimenez (2003) show that between 1989 and 2001 the federal government
favored the small province of La Rioja,  where Carlos Menem (the president at the time) had built his political
career  which received 26.5 percent of the so called fondos de aportes del tesoro nacional (funds aimed at
alleviating critical circumstances), with the closest province receiving less than 6 percent. Similar criticisms
of the political and electoral use of federal funds have been levied during the Kirchners administration (2003
to present).
14
This is in sharp contrast to the American federal scal system which mainly relies on the federal government
sharing with states the cost of some selected programs such as Medicaid, Food Stamp Program, and State
Childrens Health Insurance Program, among others. By design, then, American federal transfers are conditional
(and hence endogenous) to state spending on those particular programs.

11

simply reecting an already existing preference for more spending.
The typical inclusion of provincial xed-e¤ects may help in reducing the bias introduced
by endogeneity concerns deriving from time-invariant preferences for public spending that are
correlated with scal transfers. Indeed, this type of concern seems to be supported by the
data.

Columns 4 and 5 in Table A1 (in appendix 8.3.1) show that, on average, provinces

with higher transfers per capita tend to be the ones with larger spending per capita (and
this relationship is signi cant at the one percent level).
even after controlling for provincial and year

However, one could argue that

xed-e¤ects, the residual variation may still

be contaminated by endogeneity concerns (Knight, 2002; Gordon, 2004; Lutz, 2010).15 This
would certainly be the case if, for instance, preferences for public spending at a provincial
level have not been time-invariant and/or have evolved di¤erently over time across provinces.

4.2

Identi cation strategy: Over-representation in National Congress

We now address the endogeneity concerns just discussed by providing a plausible exogenous
variation in

scal transfers.

Based on well-established political economy arguments (e.g.

Holcombe and Zardkoohi, 1981; Atlas et al., 1995 and 1997; Knight, 2008), we exploit the
fact that over-represented jurisdictions (de ned as provinces where the number of legislators
is larger than that based on proportional representation) have tended to receive larger federal
transfers per capita, as evidenced by the following.
(about 65 percent of total

First, regarding coparticipated funds

scal transfers), Porto and Sanguinetti (2001) take issue with

the idea that the tax-sharing system mainly reected each provinces contributions, cost of
providing public goods, and redistributive considerations. Instead, they show that, since
the process that ultimately determines the allocation of federal grants is decided by the
National Congress whose members are elected representatives from speci c geographical areas,
over-represented jurisdictions tended to receive larger federal transfers per capita from the
tax-sharing system (even after including indicators capturing income per capita and cost of
provision of public goods).16
Second, regarding non-coparticipated and discretionary funds (about 35 percent of total
scal transfers)  and as mentioned in Section 3  these funds have been used by the federal
government in exchange for the support of provincial legislators in the National Congress
15

Including year xed-e¤ects also helps reducing the omitted variable bias that may occur when any systematic country-wide shocks simultaneously inuence the level of scal transfers and provincial public spending
(e.g., country-wide processes of centralization and/or decentralization).
16
Atlas et al. (1995 and 1997) o¤ers several arguments as to why constituencies of over-represented jurisdictions in the United States Senate (there is no over-representation in the United States House of Representatives)
may be more e¤ective in receiving larger transfers per capita. For example, senators from smaller states may
allocate more e¤orts to local bene t-seeking than to national policy-making because such strategy would be
more bene cial (in per capita terms) to both constituents and themselves, the less populous the senators state.

12

for laws and reforms pushed by the federal government. Since over-represented jurisdictions
have more legislators per capita, these provinces should, ceteris paribus, be an easier target for
lobbying by the federal government using discretionary funds. The reason is that, for a certain
amount of discretionary funds, the per capita bene t in an over-represented province is larger,
making it easier/cheaper to gain the support of a legislator standing for an over-represented
province. In other words, when it comes to obtaining support for laws and reforms, it should
be less costly for the federal government to obtain the support of provincial legislators from
over-represented provinces.
The next two subsections describe the proposed identi cation strategy based on constitutional reforms that altered provincial representation in the National Congress and that were
driven by national political and governability reasons.

4.3

Constitutional reforms of 1949, 1972, 1983, and 1994

Following the model of the American 1787 Constitution, the 1853 Argentinean founding Constitution established: (i) two national senators per province, and (ii) proportional representation in the National Chamber of Deputies, with seats being allocated proportionally to
provincial population, with the speci c number of people per deputy to be updated after each
national population census, and the provision that seats cannot decrease over time (art. 45).17
These principles, however, were abandoned starting in mid-twentieth century, when both Peronist and military governments, each for their own national political and governability reasons,
introduced constitutional amendments that (i) altered the degree of over-representation in the
Senate and (ii) notoriously bolstered the over-representation of less populated provinces in
the National Chamber of Deputies.18

The latter goes against the principle of one person,

one vote articulated in the still valid Argentinean Constitution.
Changes in the provincial representation in the National Congress were introduced by
the constitutional reforms of 1949, 1972, 1983, and 1994. These reforms, whose e¤ects are
briey summarized below, capture the only changes made to provincial representation in the
National Congress within the sample period. In the 1972 and 1994 constitutional reforms, the
change in the number of representatives per province was common across the board (e.g., equal
increase in the number of senators/deputies per province), which eliminates any remaining
17

According to article 47 in the Constitution, national population census are to be conducted every ten years.
Since 1947, there have been seven census: 1947, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1991, 2001, and 2010.
18
While some degree of over-representation has been documented in other federations, particularly in less
developing countries, Gibson and Calvo (2000) and Reynoso (2004) show that this feature is most extreme and
notorious in the case of Argentina. For example, in the year 2000, a vote for a National Senator in Tierra del
Fuego was equivalent to about 141 votes in Buenos Aires. Similarly and even more notably because it occurs
in the Chamber of Deputies a vote for a National Deputy in Tierra del Fuego was equivalent in the year 2000
to about 10 votes in Buenos Aires.

13

concerns about such a change possibly being the result of a province successfully lobbying for
more representation.

In the case of the 1949 and 1983 constitutional amendments, where

the change in the number of representatives per province was not the same across the board
but rather the result of a common provision that e¤ectively favored a group of provinces
(e.g., a provision that set a minimum number of deputies per province), we provide further
context regarding the political nature of each change in representation to argue in favor of an
exogenous variation.19
The main e¤ects of the reforms were as follows:
 Perons constitutional reform of 1949.

President Perón served his

rst period from

1946 to 1952. After two years in power, and in order to consolidate his political grasp,
Perón called for a broad constitutional reform allowing for the inde nite re-election of the
president (which was prohibited by the still-valid 1853 Constitution). To gather support
from peripherical provinces, this new constitution departed, for the rst time, from
the proportional representation principle in the Chamber of Deputies by establishing
a minimum of two deputies per province, regardless of population. The provinces of
Chubut, Formosa, La Rioja, Neuquen, and Santa Cruz bene ted from this provision
obtaining an extra deputy (see column 2a in Table 1). On a per-capita basis, Santa
Cruz was the most favored given its very low population.
 Military regimes constitutional reform of 1972.

Between 1966 and 1972 Argentina

was ruled by a military dictatorship. Threatened by a growing popular insurrection,
it organized an election in 1973 to leave power.

In preparation for the democratic

transition, the regime introduced in 1972 a constitutional reform which: (i) increased
the number of senators per province from 2 to 3, (ii) added 3 deputies per province
(independently of the number of seats based on strict proportional representation), and
(iii) assigned 2 deputies to the National Territory of Tierra del Fuego. The fact that
the reform increased the number of senators and deputies for all provinces equally is
clearly a strong indicator that this reform was not the result of certain provinces (with
stronger preference for public spending) lobbying for more representation. The military
regime argued that these changes responded to the need to strengthen the federal
system (decree law 19608, 1972). Indeed, constitutional scholars (e.g., Borello, 2013)
have argued that this change also aimed at giving provincial parties a larger legislative
role given the expected victory of the PJ in the presidential election.

Like Peróns

constitutional reform of 1949, this Constitutional amendment continued and deepened
19
For these latter cases, the appendix 8.3.2 also provides complementary evidence regarding the heterogeneity,
both in terms of income per capita and spending per capita, of provinces favored by these type of provisions.

14

in both legislative cameras the process of over-representation of less populated provinces.
In the Chamber of Deputies the least and most favored provinces were Buenos Aires
and Tierra del Fuego (see column 2b in Table 1). In the Chamber of Senators the most
favored province was Santa Cruz.
 Military regimes constitutional reform of 1983.

Between 1976 and December 1983,

Argentina was ruled by another military dictatorship.

A failing economy, increasing

awareness of government repression, and the loss of the Falklands/Malvinas War forced
the military to leave power in 1983.

In preparation for the democratic transition,

the regime (with support from leaders of the ve larger political parties) introduced in
1983 a constitutional reform restoring the founding Constitution of 1853, primarily to
abolish the inde nite re-election of the president introduced by the 1949 amendment.
Since the restoration of the 1853 Constitution also abolished the 1972 reform, the regime
issued a decree (i) adding 3 deputies per province and 2 to the National Territory of
Tierra del Fuego (like the 1972 reform), and (ii) increasing to 5 the minimum number
of deputies per province (from a minimum of 2 in the 1949 reform). The return to the
1853 Constitution also implied that, in the October 1983 elections, each province had a
representation of 2 senators (as opposed to 3 senators based on the 1972 reform). The
most bene ted provinces were Catamarca, La Pampa, La Rioja, San Luis, Santa Cruz,
and Santa Fe (all receiving four extra deputies). Columns 2c and 3c in Table 1 show the
number of deputies and senators per-capita for the 1983 National Congress election.
 Menems constitutional reform of 1994. President Menem, from the PJ party, served his
rst term from 1989 to 1995. After a couple of years in o¢ce, President Menem called
for a constitutional reform mainly to allow the re-election of the president (prohibited by
the reinstated 1853 Constitution). To obtain the necessary support, President Menem
negotiated with main opposition leader and former President Raúl Alfonsín (from the
UCR) an increase in the number of senators per province from 2 to 3. Alfonsín thought
that such a change would increase the UCRs representation in the Senate (Lopez,
2007). Like the 1972 constitutional amendment, the increase in one senator per province
increased the over-representation of less populated provinces such as Catamarca, La
Pampa, La Rioja, Neuquén, and Santa Cruz relative to more populated provinces such
as Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Mendoza, and Santa Fe (see column 3d in Table 1)

4.4

Lack of revision of representation in Chamber of Deputies since 1983

With the exception of a modi cation in 1991, when Tierra del Fuego became a province (thus
obtaining 5 national deputies), the provincial representation of the Chamber of Deputies has
remained intact since 1983. This unchanged provincial representation is a clear violation of
the National Constitution, which requires a revision of provincial representation after every
national census. While there have been three census since 1983 (in 1991, 2001, and 2010),
no modi cation to the number of deputies per province has taken place.

According to

Reynoso (2012) this policy (or lack of thereof) has continuously harm relatively more populous
provinces in favor of less populated ones.20

While Argentinean politicians are well aware

of this lack of revision in legislative representation based on new population census, the
surrounding political sensitivity has prevented a serious debate and legislative action.
To sum up, the constitutional reforms of 1949, 1972, 1983, and 1994, as well as the lack
of revision in representation in the Chamber of Deputies since 1983, have altered the overrepresentation in the Senate and greatly increased the over-representation of less populated
provinces in the Chamber of Deputies. More importantly for identi cation purposes, changes
over time in provincial representation in both legislatures have been driven by political and
governability considerations at the national level and were not the result of provinces with
stronger preferences/need for public spending successfully lobbying for more political representation. The next section exploits the changes over time in provincial over-representation
in the National Congress as a plausible source of exogenous variation that helps explaining
the residual variation in scal transfers per capita.

For example, he shows that while Buenos Aires should have increased the number of deputies between
1983 and 2010 by 42.8 percent (from 70 to 100), less populated provinces like Catamarca, La Rioja, La Pampa,
Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego should keep (as currently) their 1983 representation in the Chamber of
Deputies.

not), respectively, all expressed in real and per capita terms.21 We use x to denote additional
control variables. We include (i) population to proxy for heterogeneity in preferences due to
provincial size (Knight, 2002), (ii) population density and urban population to proxy for the
cost of providing public goods, and (iii) political economy determinants (like governor preelectoral period and governors party a¢liation).22 All speci cations include provincial and
year xed-e¤ects. Residuals are calculated using robust variances and relaxing the assumption of independence within groups by allowing the presence of error autocorrelation within
provinces.
Building upon our identi cation strategy detailed in Section 4, we exploit the plausible
exogenous variation in provincial over-representation in the Argentinean National Congress
to instrument the residual variation in

scal transfers per capita. For comparability with

existing literature, we rst measure provincial over or under representation using the ratio of
provincial senators and deputies over local population.
Table 2 shows the rst and second stage instrumental variables regressions. Columns a
show the results from the rst stage regression (i.e., the dependent variable is scal transfers
per capita) and columns b the one from the second stage (i.e., the dependent variable is
government spending per capita).
In Table 2, columns 1 we use national deputies per capita (normalized, for presentational purposes, to per hundred thousand people) as instrument.23;24 Column 1a shows that
provinces with greater representation in the Chamber of Deputies tend to receive larger scal
transfers per capita. For example, an additional deputy in a low populated province like Santa
Cruz increases transfers per capita by about 71 pesos; which represents about 5.6 percent of
historical provincial transfers per capita.25 In contrast, an additional deputy in a populous
province like Buenos Aires increases transfers per capita by about 0.85 pesos; which represents
about 0.5 percent of historical provincial transfers per capita.26
21

The excluded instrument

Based on the theoretical model developed above, ideally we would like to measure income for each province
using gross national product as opposed to gross domestic product. Unfortunately, since there is no such data
for provinces, we substract scal transfers from gross domestic product. All of our results remain valid if we
use, instead, gross domestic product.
22
Party a¢liation of governor is a dummy variable equal to 1 if governors a¢liation is PJ. We tried several
variations of political a liation and still found that the governors political a¢liation does not seem to matter.
23
Since there was no National Congress during military regimes, we replace the number of representatives
during such periods with 0. Porto and Sanguinetti (2001) have argued that even during military regimes the
pre-existing structure of representation in Congress mattered because the distribution of federal transfers was
done using the legal framework given by the last law passed by Congress. Results do not vary much if this
alternative strategy is used. Results are not shown for brevity.
24
According to Knight (2008), the number of representatives from each province should be scaled by the
total size of the legislative body. Results are virtually unchanged and are not shown for brevity.
25
We computed this gure using the historical provincial average population (135,084 inhabitants); that is
71 = (96:256  100; 000)=135; 084.
26
We computed this gure using the historical provincial average population (11,277,649 inhabitants); that

17

test shows that such instrument is not weak. Column 1b shows that there is a ypaper e¤ect:
the marginal propensity to spend out of local income is less than that out of scal transfers.27
The size of the ypaper e¤ect is 1.6. Because we have a single instrument we cannot perform
an over-identi cation test. In columns 2 we use national senators per capita (normalized to
per hundred thousand people) as instrument. Similar results are obtained. In columns 3 we
use both national deputies and senators per capita.

Similar results are obtained and we

cannot reject the over-identi cation test.
In Table 2, columns 4 interact national deputies per capita and national senators per
capita in order to explore whether having greater representation in both chambers provides
an extra boost to pressures for even larger federal transfers.

Column 4a indeed supports

this conjecture and also shows an important increase in the already statistically signi cant
excluded instruments F-test.28;29 Moreover, it seems that over-representation in the Chamber
of Deputies plays a much more important role than in the Senate. This seems to be a puzzle
given the fact that over-representation is, by design, more evident in the Senate. Porto and
Sanguinetti (2001), who also nd this puzzling fact, convincingly argue on page 10 that this
phenomenon can be explained by the fact that in Argentina, in general, political power (votes)
has been less concentrated in the lower chamber compared to the senate.

Consequently,

the lower chamber represents the strongest constraint to pass laws involving interregional
redistribution. In these circumstances, coalitions of provincial parties could have played the
role of referees in key congressional voters.

This possibility makes their votes in the low

chamber very valuable allowing them to obtain special bene ts in terms of federal grants.
This phenomenon is less likely in the senate as the ruling national party has in general a solid
majority there.

5.1

Robustness of source of identifying variation

For comparability with existing literature, we rst measured provincial over- and under- representation using the ratio of provincial senators and deputies to local population. It is not
desirable, though, for any of the identifying variation to come from changes over time in population which may, for example, shift the demand for public spending per capita independently
is, 0:85 = (96:256  100; 000)=11; 277; 649.
27
Control variables are typically not signi cant in our regression analysis due to the presence of year xede¤ects (in particular, due to the high degree of synchronization and/or common time pro le exhibited by these
control variables).
28
The excluded instruments F-test increases from 70.12, 9.63, and 32.12 in columns 1a, 2a, and 3a to 155.85
in column 4a.
29
Our ndings strongly hold to the exclusion of Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego from the analysis. This
eliminates any concern that our ndings may be driven by the conditional variation in the instruments provided
by these two small provinces with almost no population.

18

of changes in scal transfers.
To remove this possibility, we perform two robustness tests.

First, we include popu-

lation squared or in cubic form. Results continue to hold and are not shown for brevitys
sake. Second  and given our identi cation strategy based on changes in provincial over- and
under-representation associated with constitutional reforms  we restrict the instrument to
the portion of the over- and under-representation episodes discussed in Section 4.2. To this
end, we use the e¤ective distortion measure in Tables A2 and A3 (in appendix 8.3.3) as the
instrument. This measure is computed as the ratio of the absolute distortion (term coined
to refer to the di¤erence between the number of national deputies/senators per jurisdiction,
including the provisions established in each reform, and that based on proportional representation) to population.30 Table 3 shows the results of using these alternative measures. Our
main results continue to hold. It is worth noting that the correlation between national deputy
per capita (instrument used in Table 2) and the e¤ective distortion in national chamber of
deputies (instrument used in Table 3) is 0.94 and that we reject the null hypothesis that such
correlation is zero. The same occurs for the senator instrumental variables with a correlation
of 0.93. This extremely high degree of correlation across these alternative measures is robust
to demeaning the variables by province and/or by year.
To sum up, the source of identifying variation frequently used in the literature (legislators per capita) is essentially driven by the identi cation strategy based on provincial overrepresentation changes associated with constitutional reforms proposed in Section 4.2 and not
by the change in population over time.

Flypaper e¤ect: Insurance arguments

Before proceeding with the econometric analysis we should note that  conveniently for identi cation purposes  the correlation between income and scal transfers () as well as the
volatility of income ( 2y ) and scal transfers ( 2f ) vary considerably even after de-trending
these variables by provinces and years. This residual variation (i.e., standard deviation) accounts for about 55 to 75 percent of the overall variation. In all cases we use a 10-year rolling
window to compute these statistical measures.31 The overall standard deviation of  is 0.51;
with a mean of 0.12. While the standard deviation across provinces (i.e., between) is 0.18,
the standard deviation within provinces over time is 0.48. Moreover, if we further decompose
30

See appendix 8.3.3 (and Tables A2 and A3 therein).
In particular,  is the correlation between the cyclical components of income and scal transfers, while  2y
and  2f stand for the variance of the cyclical component of income and scal transfers, respectively. We use
the cyclical components to perform these calculations because our story is related to precautionary saving (i.e.,
self-insurance arguments) and hence, in terms of the data should depend on cyclical volatility.
31

19

the within standard deviation between a common component over time (i.e., within year)
and a residual one, we nd that both components are fairly similar; the rst one is 0.36 and
the second one is 0.32. In other words, even after accounting for both provincial and year
de-trending, the residual variability observed in  is quite large. Indeed, Table 4 (columns
1-3) shows an important cross-province as well as time variation. On average, the median 
(column 2) is close to zero (0.06), yet it varies greatly across provinces (from 0.68 in Córdoba
to -0.37 in Río Negro). The within variability is also quite pronounced for most provinces,
ranging from negative to positive values. The volatility of income ( 2y ) and scal transfers
( 2f ) also shows signi cant variability both across provinces and over time.32
Since ,  2y , and  2f are calculated using 10-year rolling windows, the sample size of the
regression used to test the role of insurance arguments will shrink with respect to those of
Tables 2 and 3. In particular, the rst observation will now date back to 1972. The results
obtained in Tables 2 and 3 strongly hold if we restrict our sample to begin in 1972. Replicating
our preferred speci cation (column 3, in Table 2), the magnitude of the ypaper e¤ect is 1.2
with a 95 percent con dence interval of [0.8,1.6].33
Our rst empirical implication (Proposition 2) states that the ypaper e¤ect is a decreasing
function of the correlation between private income and scal transfers. This occurs because
d(4g1f )=d < d (4g1y ) =d < 0. Moreover, our second empirical implication (Proposition 3)
indicates that such relationship becomes stronger the higher is the volatility of private income
and/or scal transfers. To test such implications, we add to the basic regression  given by
(11)  additional terms that control for ,  2y ,  2f and all relevant interactions (relevant terms
involving interactions with income and federal transfers are speci ed in Table 5).
Table 5, column 1 shows the regression results. Based on the theoretical model developed
in Section 2, the coe¢cients

The overall standard deviation of  2y is 0.08; with a mean of 0.05. While the variation across provinces
(i.e., between) is 0.05, the variation within provinces over time is 0.06. Moreover, if we further decomponse
the within variation between a common component over time (i.e., within year) and an residual one, we nd
that the rst one is 0.02 and the second one is 0.06. In other words, even after accounting for both provincial
and year de-trending, the residual variability observed in  2y is quite large. Indeed, Table 4 (columns 4 to 6)
shows important cross province as well as over time variation. Similar ndings are obtained for  2f .
33
Results are not shown for brevity.

20

Table 5 supports our two empirical implications. Most coe¢cients have the expected signs.
While

1

and

13

are positive, this occurs because of multicollinearity.34 Furthermore, and

as predicted by our model, the coe¢cients associated with scal transfers tend to be higher
in absolute value than those associated with output.35
We now use the ndings of column 1 in Table 5 and alternative values of ,  2y , and  2f
to check whether the econometric model is capable of replicating our theoretical models two
empirical implications. While the ndings of column 1 in Table 5 support our two empirical
implications, the illustrations below aim at showing the econometric results in a way that is
easier to visualize. Further, Sub-section 6.3 uses public savings rate data to provide additional
evidence to the e¤ect that the empirical ndings are indeed driven by the proposed mechanism
(i.e., insurance arguments). Finally, Sub-section 6.4 assesses the quantitative importance of
the insurance arguments in explaining the ypaper e¤ect observed in Argentina.

6.1

Illustration of rst empirical implication

We now use our ndings of column 1 in Table 5 and alternative values of ,  2y , and  2f to
check whether the econometric model is capable of replicating our theoretical models rst
empirical implication, which states that the ypaper e¤ect should be a decreasing function
of the correlation between local income and scal transfers.

As a reference point, notice

that the ypaper e¤ect evaluated for the median (i.e., 50th percentile) of all three arguments
( 2y = 0:03,  2f = 0:17, and  = 0:06) is 0.55 (and statistically di¤erent from 0).

Figure

2 plots the ypaper e¤ect obtained keeping constant  2y and  2f at their median values and
varying  (in our sample  varies between -0.96 and 0.99). We can see that, as predicted by
the theoretical model, the ypaper e¤ect is a decreasing function of the correlation between
local income and scal transfers.

6.2

Illustration of second empirical implication

Our second empirical implication indicates that the rst empirical implication becomes stronger
(weaker) the higher (lower) is the volatility of local income and/or scal transfers. Like Figure 2, Figure 3 shows the magnitude of the ypaper e¤ect obtained for the median values of
 2y and  2f , and alternative values of  (solid black line). To explore the role of higher and
lower variance, we also compute the ypaper e¤ect for di¤erent values of  2y .36 In particular,
34
The correlation between   y, and  2y    y,  2f    y, and  2y   2f    y is, respectively, 0.55, 0.82, and 0.50.
In all cases we cannot reject that such correlation is signi catively di¤erent from zero at the one percent level.
35
Speci cally, we cannot reject the null that j 2 j > j 1 j, j 8 j > j 7 j, j 10 j > j 9 j, and j 14 j > j 13 j at the
one percent level of signi cance.
36
Recall that local income is the main source of total income (i.e., 1 >  > 0:5 from Section 2.1).

21

Figure 3 also shows the results obtained when using the 75th percentile value of  2y = 0:05
(solid grey line) and 25th percentile value of  2y = 0:02 (dashed black line).
A couple of observations are in order. First, notice that for the maximum , all calculations
result in the same ypaper e¤ect, independently of the value of  2y .

This nding con rms

that for extremely high  values, there is no space for scal transfers to provide any insurance
(even for relatively high uncertainty). Second, as the value of  decreases, the insurance role
of scal transfers becomes stronger as uncertainty becomes higher (i.e., for the 75th percentile
value of  2y , given by the solid grey line) and weakens when uncertainty is lower (i.e., 25th
percentile value of  2y , given by the dashed black line). Hence, the econometric evidence fully
supports our theoretical models second empirical implication.

6.3

Evidence of the transmission mechanism

So far in this section, we have shown strong evidence supporting the role of insurance arguments in determining the ypaper e¤ect.

Yet further evidence is required if one wants

to be fully convinced that these ndings are indeed driven by the proposed mechanism (i.e.,
insurance arguments) and not changes in private consumption (via changes in taxes). Specifically, the concern is that an increase in the ypaper e¤ect when  decreases may not be
driven by lower saving in response to a scal transfer relative to the response to an increase
in local income (as suggested by the theoretical model), but rather by increases in taxes (and
therefore, lower consumption). We now show that this is not the case, and that the mechanism operating in our previous ndings is, indeed, via savings/insurance arguments. For this
purpose, we use provincial public savings rate data (S).37;38 For further reference, de ne the
di¤erential e¤ect in public savings rate (DS) as
DS  S y

S f ;

where 4S f and 4S y denote the change in provincial public savings rate that results from a
shock to scal transfers and private income, respectively.
Using the same strategy as in column 1 in Table 5, in column 3 we use provincial public
savings rate as the dependent variable.

Like column 2, column 4 summarizes the models

predicted results for this variable. Most coe¢cients have the correct sign, yet in some cases
they are not statistically signi cant. This is due to multicollinearity. Like Figure 2 (in which

Unfortunately, we do not have information about private savings rate or private consumption in each
province.

Provincial public savings rate is de ned as the ratio of provincial primary scal balance (i.e., di¤erence
between provincial current revenues and government spending) to provincial revenues.

we plot the ypaper e¤ect for median variances and varying ) and Figure 3 (in which we
also compute the ypaper e¤ect for di¤erent values of  2y ), Figure 4 plots the results when
using provincial public savings rate (DS is in the y-axis). Figure 4 strongly supports the
transmission mechanism proposed. As  decreases (becoming less positive or more negative),
provincial governments save less in response to an increase in scal transfers than in response
to an equivalent increase in local income. Moreover, this e¤ect becomes larger (smaller) as
uncertainty becomes higher (lower).

While less obvious than in the ypaper case (Figure

3), it is also worth noting that DS tends to converge across di¤erent uncertainty levels when
 = 1. This further supporst our models prediction that as  becomes closer to 1, the role
of insurance arguments tends to weakens.

6.4

Quantifying the importance of insurance arguments

The results presented in Table 5 as well as the evidence presented in Sub-sections 6.1, 6.2, and
6.3 strongly support the mechanism based on insurance arguments proposed in our theoretical
model. This sub-section assesses the quantitative importance of the insurance arguments in
explaining the ypaper e¤ect observed in Argentina. Recall that for the time period used in
Table 5 (i.e., 1972-2006), the magnitude of the ypaper e¤ect is 1.2.
Our starting point is to compute the ypaper e¤ect predicted by the econometric model
for the case in which our theory indicates that the ypaper e¤ect explained by insurance
arguments should be zero.

Recall that our theoretical model tells us (Proposition 1) that

when the variance of the shock to income and scal transfers is the same and the correlation
is one, the ypaper is zero.

Using the median sample output variance in our sample as a

proxy for both the variance of the income shock and scal shock and  = 1, we obtain39
F P j2y =2 =0:03; =1 = 0:42:
f

We interpret this gure as saying that 0.42 of the ypaper e¤ect cannot be explained by our
insurance arguments.
In order to evaluate the importance of the proposed mechanism with respect to that of the
empirical estimates, we evaluate the ypaper e¤ect for the median sample value of  (0:06),
39

Alternatively, we could have performed this calculation using the median sample variance of scal transfers
(equal to 0.17), in which case we would have obtained a ypaper of size 0.45 (i.e., F P j2 =2 =0:17; =1 = 0:45).
y

f

This con rms our models prediction that when  = 1 and  2y =  2f , the precise level of variances does not
seem to matter.

23

 2y (0:03), and  2f (0:17) to obtain:
F P j2y =0:03; 2 =0:17; =0:06 = 0:56:
f

Therefore, the insurance arguments explain about 12 percent of the observed ypaper e¤ect
((0:56

7

0:42)=1:2).

Conclusions

This paper has o¤ered a new theoretical explanation for the ypaper e¤ect based on macroeconomic insurance arguments. In our view of the world, subnational units have two uncertain
sources of income: private income and scal transfers. As long as the correlation between the
two is not one (and assuming that, as is the case in practice, scal transfers are less than private income), an increase in scal transfers will raise the variance of total income by less than
an increase in private income. As a result, the amount of additional precautionary savings is
lower in response to the increase in scal transfers and the increase in public spending correspondingly higher. The only friction required for our arguments to go through is incomplete
markets. If markets were complete, the ypaper e¤ect would vanish. Since nobody would
argue that nancial markets are complete in practice, especially in the developing world, our
model provides an extremely plausible additional explanation for the ypaper e¤ect puzzle.
In addition, the theoretical model yields two testable empirical implications: (i) the ypaper e¤ect should be a decreasing function of the correlation between scal transfers and
private income, and (ii) such relationship should become stronger the higher is the volatility
of transfers and/or private income. We show that these hypotheses hold for a sample of Argentinean provinces. We also show that this novel mechanism accounts for about 12 percent
of the observed ypaper e¤ect and may thus complement other well-known explanations in
the literature.

Theoretical models
One-period model

Consider a one-period economy.40 The exogenous levels of private income (y) and
transfers (f ) are given by, respectively:

scal

y = y + sy ;

(12)

f

(13)

= f + sf ;

where y and f are initial (i.e., pre-shock) levels of private income and scal transfers, respectively, and sy and sf denote the private income and scal transfer shocks, respectively. To
evaluate the e¤ects of shocks to private income and scal transfers, we consider an initial
equilibrium characterized by sy = sf = 0. A private income shock consists of an increase in
sy such that 4y = 1 (i.e., sy = 1), while a scal transfer shock consists of an increase in sf
such that 4f = 1 (i.e., sf = 1).
Let preferences be given by
W = u(c) + v(g);
(14)
where W stands for welfare and  > 0 captures preferences for public spending. For simplicity,
assume also that u(:) and v(:) take the same functional form (i.e., u(:) = v(:) = h(:)).
The representative citizens (RCs) income constraint is given by
y + f = c + g:

(15)

The RC chooses c and g to maximize (14) subject to (15). Combining the rst order conditions, we obtain
(16)
h0 (c) = h0 (g) ;
40

We think of our economy as a small open economy but, in this one-period version, it is identical to a closed
economy.

27

or, alternatively,
c = g:

(17)

RCs total income is allocated between c and g depending on the value of .
Taking into account (12), (13), (15), and (17) we obtain

1
c
=g=
y + sy + f + sf :

1+

(18)

If sy = 1 (private income shock) and sf = 1 ( scal transfer shock), then 4g f = 4g y .
Similarly, 4cf = 4cy . It thus follows from (18) that both private income and scal transfer
shocks generate the same increase in g. Hence, F P = 0.
8.2.2

Two-period model with certainty

Consider a small open economy perfectly integrated into world goods and capital markets.
To abstract from consumption tilting, assume that = 1= (1 + r), where > 0 is the discount
factor and r > 0 is the world real interest rate. The exogenous levels of income and scal
transfers, given by y1 and f1 in period 1 and y2 and f2 in period 2, take the form
y1 = y2 = y + sy ;

(19)

f1 = f2 = f + sf :

(20)

In this two-period model, a private income shock is de ned as a dollar increase in each periods
private income (i.e., 4y1 = 4y2 = sy = 1) and a scal transfer shock as an equivalent increase
in scal transfers (i.e., 4f1 = 4f2 = sf = 1).41
Preferences are now given by
W = u(c1 ) + v(g1 ) +

[u(c2 ) + v(g2 )] :

(21)

Again, we assume that u(c) and v(g) take the same functional form.
The RCs intertemporal income constraint is given by
y1 + f1 +

y2 + f2
c2 + g2
= c1 + g1 +
:
1+r
1+r

(22)

Equation (22) has the usual interpretation that the present discounted value of private and
public spending must equal the present discounted value of private income and scal transfers.
The RC chooses c1 , c2 , g1 and g2 to maximize (21) subject to (22). The rst order
conditions imply that
h0 (c1 ) = h0 (c2 ) = h0 (g1 ) = h0 (g2 ) ;

(23)

c1 = c2 = g1 = g2 :

(24)

or, alternatively,
41

In line with the literature on the ypaper e¤ect and, more importantly, in order to have analytical solutions
in the case of uncertainty and incomplete markets, we model private income and scal transfer shocks as
permanent (i.e., they occur in both periods). Our main results would not change if shocks were assumed to be
temporary in a multi-period or in nite horizon framework.

28

Taking into account equations (19), (20), (22), and (24), we obtain

c1

(25)

It follows that if sy = 1 (income shock) and sf = 1 ( scal transfer shock), then 4g1f = 4g1y .
Similarly, 4cf1 = 4cy1 . Hence, both private income and scal transfer shocks generate the
same increase in g1 and g2 and, thus, F P = 0.42;43
8.2.3

Two-period model with uncertainty and complete markets

Based on (3) and (5), it follows that
 2y2 +f2 =  2y2 +  2f2 + 2 y2  f2 :

(26)

where  2y2 +f2 ,  2y2 , and  2f2 denote the variance of total income, private income, and scal
transfers, respectively.
We now turn to the RCs optimization problem. The RCs intertemporal total income
constraint takes the form44
ZZ

y1 + f1 +
q ("y ; "f ) [y2 ("y ) + f2 ("f )]d"y d"f
1+r
ZZ
1
= g1 + c1 +
(27)
q ("y ; "f ) [c2 ("y ; "f ) + g2 ("y ; "f )]d"y d"f ;
1+r
where q ("y ; "f ) is the price of the contingent asset that promises to pay one unit of output in
each state of nature determined by the realization of "y and "f .
Preferences are given by (8). Once again, we assume that u(c) and v(g) take the same
functional form (i.e., u(:) = v(:) = h(:)).
The RC maximizes (8) by choosing c1 , c2 ("y ; "f ), g1 , and g2 ("y ; "f ) subject to the constraint (27). Assuming actuarially fair insurance, which implies that q ("y ; "f ) = p ("y ; "f ),
the rst order conditions can be expressed as
h0 (c1 ) = h0 (c2 ) = h0 (g1 ) = h0 (g2 ) ;

(28)

c1 = c2 = g1 = g2 :

(29)

or, alternatively,
Taking into account (2)-(5), (29), and q ("y ; "f ) = p ("y ; "f ) ; we obtain

(30)

In this two-period model with no uncertainty, we could de ne the ypaper e¤ect in both period 1 and 2.
When we introduce uncertainty, however, we will de ne the ypaper e¤ect only in period 1 because that is the
only period in which precautionary savings will play a role.
43
Notice that, given the at income structure speci ed in (19) and (20), there are no savings in our model
for consumption smoothing motives. It is easy to check, however, that the ypaper e¤ect would be zero even
if this were not the case.
44
As usual, we omit giving the RC a risk free bond since it would be redundant.

29

which, as expected, coincides with the solution for the certainty case, given in (25). From
expression (30), it is clear that shocks to either private income or scal transfers generate the
same increase in both c1 and g1 . Therefore,
F P = 0:

(31)

As in the one-period model (section 8.2.1) or the two-period model with certainty (section
8.2.2), the optimal allocation of resources does not depend on the source of nancing. This
occurs because complete markets allow the RC to fully insure against all possible contingencies
in period 2. Naturally, the presence of complete markets implies no precautionary savings.
8.2.4

Two-period model with uncertainty and incomplete markets

The RC chooses c1 , c2 ("y ; "f ), g1 , and g2 ("y ; "f ) to maximize expected utility, given by (8),
subject to (9) which holds for every realization of "y and "f . Assuming (1 + r) = 1; the

Argentina: Background and scal structure
Provincial makeup

A federal republic, Argentina consists of 24 subnational jurisdictions: 23 provinces (see Table
A1) and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. As in many other developing countries, production and population are highly concentrated in a few provinces. About half of Argentinas
GDP is concentrated in 4 provinces (Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Santa Fe, and Mendoza), and
just one province (Buenos Aires) accounts for about 35 percent of the countrys output (column 1, Table A1).46 Not surprisingly, these 4 provinces account for 61 percent of total
population (column 2, Table A1).
The remaining 19 provinces (i.e., more than 80 percent of the total number of provinces)
are typically sparsely populated with an average population density similar to that of New
Mexico and Kazakhstan (about 17 habitants per square mile).47 Importantly for our purposes, these 19 provinces show a very high degree of heterogeneity in many aspects, including
their levels of GDP per capita, productive structure, economic development, and social indicators. Some provinces like Catamarca, Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, Jujuy, La Rioja, Misiones,
and Santiago del Estero have had, historically, GDP per capita of about a half of the national
average (column 3, Table A1), comparable to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Paraguay. In
contrast, some provinces like Neuquén, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego have the highest
45

We assume that 1 >  > 0:5.
In comparison, the state of California (the state with the largest GDP in the United States) accounts for
only 13 percent of the United States output.
47
The average population density of the 4 main provinces (Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Santa Fe, and Mendoza)
is about 5 times that of the remaining 19 provinces, and similar to that of the United States (about 82 habitants
per square mile).

Over and under representation in National Congress

Peróns Constitutional reform of 1949 The provision of a minimum of two deputies per
province was driven by political considerations at the national level and was not the result
of particular province(s) with unusually strong preference for public spending successfully
lobbying for more political representation and power. As discussed in Gibson and Calvo
(2000), a look at Peronisms evolution provides a sense of the centrality of its own peripheral
coalition to the partys electoral viability and national governing capabilities...Peronism was
much about a party shaped by federalism and regional power structures as it was by class
conict in the metropolis...Peronisms seeming invincibility at the polls [...] was due not to
the organized labor in the metropolis, but to its ties to clientelistic and traditional networks of
power and electoral mobilization in the periphery. Indeed, the provinces that bene ted the
most from this provision involved high income provinces like Chubut and Santa Cruz, poor
ones like Formosa and La Rioja as well as a middle income province like Neuquén.49 Regarding
government spending per capita, Santa Cruz and Neuquén spent above the provincial average,
Chubut and La Rioja around the provincial average, and Formosa below the average.50 While
normalizing provincial spending by income does a¤ect the ranking just described, it does
not change the nding about the heterogeneity of the provinces that bene tted from the
provision.51
Military regime reform of 1983 The 5 provinces favored by the minimum of 5 deputies
per province provision were Catamarca, La Pampa, La Rioja, San Luis, and Santa Cruz.
Moreover, the 5 provinces that bene ted are very heterogeneous, in terms of both income
and spending per capita. Again, this clearly suggests that lobbying on the part of certain
provinces was not behind these changes. Provinces that bene ted comprised high income
provinces like Santa Cruz, poor ones like Catamarca and La Rioja, as well as a middle income
provinces like San Luis and La Pampa.52 Regarding government spending per capita, Santa
Cruz spent above the provincial average, Catamarca, La Pampa and La Rioja around the
provincial average, and San Luis below the average.53 While normalizing provincial spending
48

Chubut, Neuquén, and Santa Cruz are important oil producers.
We cannot reject the null (at the one percent level) that the average income per capita of the 5 provinces
that bene ted from the provision of a minimum of two deputies per province ($5,769) is the same as that of
the provinces that did not bene t ($4,864).
50
We cannot reject (at the one percent level) the null that the average spending per capita of the 5 provinces
that bene ted from the provision ($524) is the same as that of the provinces that did not bene t ($306).
51
Again, we cannot reject (at the one percent level) the null that the average (normalized) spending per
capita of the 5 provinces that bene ted from the provision (10.4%) is the same as that of the provinces that
did not bene t (7.1%).
52
We cannot reject the null (at the one percent level) that the average income per capita of the 5 provinces
that bene ted from the provision of a minimum of 5 deputies per province ($7,184) is the same as that of the
provinces that did not bene t ($7,405).
53
Again, we cannot reject the null (at the one percent level) that the average spending per capita of the 5
provinces that bene ted from the provision ($1,124) is the same as that of the provinces that did not bene t
($767).

8.3.3

Absolute and e¤ective distortion

Column 2 in Table A2 (Table A3), shows for each National Congress election  following each
constitutional amendment modifying the structure of the Chamber of Deputies (Senators) 
the absolute distortion per province in the Chamber of Deputies (Senators).
The absolute distortion is measured as the di¤erence between the number of national legislators per jurisdiction including the provision(s) established in each reform and that based on
proportional representation. For the Chamber of Deputies, the number of national deputies
per jurisdiction based on proportional representation is calculated dividing the provincial
population by the speci c number of people per deputy o¢cially updated after each national
population census.55 For the Chamber of Senators, the number of national senators per
jurisdiction based on proportional representation is calculated by dividing the provincial population by the ratio of total country population to the total number of senators.56 In column
3, we show the e¤ective distortion per province, calculated as the ratio of the absolute distortion (column 2) to provincial population (column 1). This measure controls for the fact
that, for a given level of absolute distortion, provinces with smaller population bene t on a
per capita basis by a larger margin than more populous provinces.
54
Again, we cannot reject (at the one percent level) the null that the average spending per capita of the 5
provinces that bene ted from the provision (18.2%) is the same as that of those provinces that did not bene t
(12.6%).
55
For example, for the 1958 election, the speci c number of people per deputy based on the 1947 national
population census was established in 85,000. Based on this gure, Buenos Aires should have and indeed
obtained 50 deputies (therefore its absolute distortion was zero). On the other hand, Santa Cruz should have
obtained only one deputy, yet the provision included in the Peróns Constitutional reform of 1949 establishing
a minimum of two deputies per province, regardless of population, gave Santa Cruz another extra deputy.
56
For example, for the 1958 election, the Chamber of Senator had 46 members (2 senators per subnational
elegible jurisdiction). Since the total population in the 1947 national census was 15.894 millions, the number of
people per senator based on proportional representation would have been 345,521. Based on this principle, for
example, the provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Cruz would have received 12.37 and 0.12 senators. Instead
they both received 2 senators, regardless of their population, which implied an absolute distortion of -10.37
(under-representation) and 1.88 (over-representation) for Buenos Aires and Santa Cruz, respectively. Since, by
construction, the sum of absolute distortions across provinces is zero, we calculate the total absolute distotion
by summing the absolute values of the absolute distortions for each province. Similar results are obtained if
one represents the number of senators based on proportional representation rounding up (or down) to the next
integer. Results are not shown for brevity.

Notes: ȡ stands for the correlation between the cyclical components of income and fiscal transfers. ı2y and ı2f stand for the variance of the cyclical component of
income and fiscal transfers, respectively. In all cases, we use a 10-year rolling window. For presentational convenience, we normalize ı²y and ı²f to lie between 0
and 1.

Effective
distortion

Notes: *National Territory until 1991. Tierra del Fuego did not have political representation in National Chamber of Deputies until 1972. Absolute distortion (column 2) is measured as the difference between the number of
national deputies per jurisdiction including the provision(s) established in each reform and that based on proportional representation. To compute the number of national deputies per province based on proportional representation
for the 1949, 1972, and 1983 Constitutional reforms, we divided the provincial population in the 1947, 1970, and 1980 national population census by 85,000, 135,000, 161,000, respectively. The effective distortion (column 3) is
computed as the ratio of the absolute distortion (column 2) to population (column 1).

Effective
distortion

Notes: *National Territory until 1991. Tierra del Fuego did not have political representation in National Chamber of Senators until it became province in 1991. Absolute distortion (column 2) is measured as the difference between the number of national senators per jurisdiction
established in each reform and that based on proportional representation. To compute the number of national senators per province based on proportional representation we divided the provincial population by the ratio of total country population to the total number of senators. The
total number of senators were 46, 69, 46, and 72 after the 1949, 1972, 1983, and 1994 Constitutional reforms, respectively. The effective distortion (column 3) is calculated as the ratio of the absolute distortion (column 2) to population (column 1). Total absolute and effective
distortions (indicated by ॱ) are computed by summing the absolute values of the respective distortions for each province.
