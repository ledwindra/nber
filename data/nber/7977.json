    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper uses a rich employer-employee matched data set to investigate the existence and the extent of nonprofit and part-time wage and compensation differentials in child care.  The empirical strategy adjusts for workers' self-selection into the for-profit or nonprofit sectors,  into full-time or part-time work, as well as unobserved worker heterogeneity using a discrete factor model.   We find differences between the regimes (full-time for-profit, full-time nonprofit, part-time for-profit, part-time nonprofit) in the way in which human capital of the workers are rewarded. There is substantial variation in wages as a function of employee characteristics, and there is variation in wages within sectors.  The results indicate that part-time jobs are  good' jobs in center-based child care.  Furthermore, despite the evidence supporting the labor donation hypothesis, our results indicate the existence of nonprofit wage and compensation premiums, which support the property rights hypothesis.\n\n",
