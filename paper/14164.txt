Determinacy, Learnability, and Plausibility in Monetary Policy Analysis: Additional Results
Bennett T. McCallum
NBER Working Paper No. 14164
July 2008
JEL No. C62,E30,E52
ABSTRACT
In a very broad class of dynamic linear models, if agents possess knowledge of current endogenous
variables in a least-squares learning process, determinacy of a rational expectations (RE) equilibrium
is sufficient but not necessary for learnability of that equilibrium. Thus, since learnability is an attractive
necessary condition for plausibility of any equilibrium, there may exist a single plausible RE solution
even in cases of indeterminacy. This paper proposes and outlines a distinct criterion that plausible
models should possess, termed "well formulated" (WF), which rules out infinite discontinuities in
the implied impulse response functions. The paper explores the relationship between this WF property
and learnability, under the information assumption mentioned above, and finds that they often agree
but neither strictly implies the other. Extending the P-matrix requirement, implied for specified matrices
by the WF property, to one that demands positive dominant-diagonal matrices would guarantee both
WF and learnability, but a suitable rationale has not been found. Finally, under a second information
assumption, which gives the agents only lagged information on endogenous variables during the learning
process, the situation is less favorable in the sense that learnability can be guaranteed only under special
assumptions.

1. Introduction
It is almost unnecessary to begin by emphasizing that recent research in monetary policy
analysis has featured a great deal of work concerning conditions for determinacy—i.e., existence
of a unique dynamically stable rational expectations equilibrium—under various specifications
of policy behavior.1 Indeed, there are a number of papers in which determinacy is the only
criterion for a desirable monetary policy regime that is explicitly mentioned.2
By contrast, I have argued in recent publications (McCallum, 2003a, 2007) that leastsquares (LS) learnability is a compelling necessary condition for a rational expectations (RE)
equilibrium to be considered plausible, since individuals must somehow learn about the exact
nature of an economy from data generated by that economy itself, while the LS learning process
is biased toward a finding of learnability. A similar position has also been expressed by Bullard
(2006, p. 2004). From such a position it follows that in conditions in which there is more than
one dynamically stable RE solution—i.e., indeterminacy—there may still be only one RE
solution that is economically relevant, if the others are not LS learnable. In this sense, LS
learnability is arguably a more important criterion than determinacy.
It may be useful to expand briefly on the contention that LS learnability is a compelling
necessary condition. The argument begins with the idea that, in actual economies, agents must
ultimately obtain quantitative details concerning their economy, necessary for forming
expectations, from data generated by that economy. Accordingly, the same should be true for the
model economy used by a researcher. There are many conceivable learning processes, of course,
so it would be rash to presume that any single one is relevant. Thus we do not argue that LS
learnability is a sufficient condition for a RE equilibrium to be plausible. But the setup for LS

learnability (see Evans and Honkapohja, 2003) is specified in a way that is, in a sense, biased
towards a finding of learnability. Specifically, it assumes that agents know the correct structure
qualitatively—i.e., know which variables are relevant. In addition, the process assumes that
agents are collecting an ever-increasing number of observations on all relevant variables while
the structure is remaining unchanged. Furthermore, the agents are estimating the relevant
unknown parameters with an appropriate estimator.3 Consequently, it seems, all in all, that if a
proposed RE solution is not learnable by the LS process in question, it is implausible that it could
prevail in practice.
Substantively, my 2007 paper demonstrates that, in a very wide class of linear RE models,
determinacy implies LS learnability (but not the converse) when individuals have knowledge of
current conditions available for use in the learning process. This strong result does not pertain,
however, if individuals have available, in the learning process, only information regarding
previous values of endogenous variables.4 One task of the present paper, accordingly, is to
investigate the situation that obtains when only lagged information is available. In addition, the
paper will explore results that pertain when an alternative criterion of model plausibility,
provisionally termed “well-formulated,” characterizes the model’s structure. In particular, it is
shown that models that are well formulated, in the defined sense, often (but not invariably)
possess the property of E-stability and hence LS learnability if current-period information is
available in the learning process, even if determinacy does not prevail. Thus plausibility of a RE
solution requires both that it be learnable and that the model at hand be well formulated. A
sufficient condition for both of these to hold, requiring that certain matrices have positive

Another limitation of the analysis of McCallum (2007) is that it considers only solutions of a form that excludes
“resonant frequency sunspot” solutions. That limitation, which is maintained here, is discussed briefly in Section 6.

dominant diagonals, is introduced and considered below. Unfortunately, the situation in the case
of lagged information is less favorable—i.e., learnability can be assured only in special cases, for
which no general characterization has been found.
2. Model and Determinacy
It will be useful to begin with a summary of the formulation and results developed in
McCallum (2007). Throughout we will work with a model of the form
(1)

yt = A Etyt+1 + C yt-1 + D ut,

where yt is a m×1 vector of endogenous variables, A and C are m×m matrices of real numbers, D
is m×n, and ut is a n×1 vector of exogenous variables generated by a dynamically stable process
(2)

ut = R ut-1 + εt,

with εt a white noise vector. It will not be assumed, even initially, that A is invertible. This
specification is useful in part because it is the one utilized in Section 10.3 of Evans and
Honkapohja (2001), for which E-stability conditions are reported on their p. 238.5 Furthermore,
the specification is very broad; in particular, any model satisfying the formulations of King and
Watson (1998) or Klein (2001), can be written in this form—which will accommodate any
number of lags, expectational leads, and lags of leads. (See Appendix A.)
Following McCallum (1983, 1998), we consider solutions to model (1)-(2) of the form
(3)

yt = Ω yt-1 + Γ ut.

in which Ω is required to be real. Then we have that Etyt+1 = Ω(Ωyt-1 + Γut) + ΓRut and
straightforward undetermined-coefficient reasoning shows that Ω and Γ must satisfy
(4)

AΩ2 − Ω + C = 0

(5)

Γ = AΩΓ + AΓR + D.

5

Constant terms can be included in the equations of (1) by including an exogenous variable in ut that is a random
walk whose innovation has variance zero. In this case there is a borderline departure from process stability.

3

For any given Ω, (5) yields a unique Γ generically,6 but there are many m×m matrices that solve
(4) for Ω. Accordingly, the following analysis centers around (4). Since we do not assume that
A is invertible, we write
(6)

 A 0 Ω2   I
0 I    =  I

 Ω  

−C   Ω 
,
0   I 

in which the first row reproduces the matrix quadratic (4). Let the 2m×2m matrices on the left
and right sides of (6) be denoted A and C , respectively. Then instead of focusing on the
eigenvalues of A −1 C , which does not exist when A is singular, we instead solve for the
(generalized) eigenvalues of the matrix pencil [ C − λ A ], alternatively termed the (generalized)

eigenvalues of C with respect to A (e.g., Uhlig (1999)). Thus instead of diagonalizing A −1 C ,
as in Blanchard and Khan (1980), we use the Schur generalized decomposition, which serves the
same purpose. Specifically, the Schur generalized decomposition theorem establishes that there
exist unitary matrices Q and Z such that Q C Z = T and Q A Z = S with T and S triangular.7 Then
eigenvalues of the matrix pencil ( C −λ A ) are defined as tii/sii. Some of these eigenvalues may
be “infinite,” in the sense that some sii may equal zero. This will be the case, indeed, whenever
A and therefore A are of less than full rank since then S is also singular. All of the foregoing is
true for any ordering of the eigenvalues and associated columns of Z (and rows of Q). For the
present, let us focus on the arrangement that places the tii/sii in order of decreasing modulus.8
To begin the analysis, premultiply (6) by Q. Since Q A = SH and Q C = TH, where H ≡
Z-1, the resulting equation can be written as
6

Generically, I − R’⊗[(I − AΩ)-1A] will be invertible, permitting solution of (5) for vec(Γ). Invertibility of (I − AΩ)
is discussed below in Section 4.
7
Provided only that there exists some λ for which det[ C − λ A ] ≠ 0. See Klein (2000) or Golub and Van Loan
(1996, p. 377). Note that in McCallum (2007) the matrices A and A are denoted A and A11, repectively.
8
The discussion proceeds as if none of the tii/sii equals 1.0 exactly. If one does, the model can be adjusted, by
multiplying some relevant coefficient by (e.g.) 0.9999.



The first row of (7) reduces to
(8)

S11(H11Ω + H12)Ω = T11(H11Ω + H12).

Then if H11 is invertible the latter can be used to solve for Ω as
(9)

Ω = −H11-1 H12 = −Η11−1(−Η11Ζ12Ζ22−1) = Ζ12Ζ22−1,

where the second equality comes from the upper right-hand submatrix of the identity HZ = I,
provided that H11 is invertible, which we assume without significant loss of generality.9 10
As mentioned above, there are many solutions Ω to (4). These correspond to different
arrangements of the eigenvalues, which result in different groupings of the columns of Z and
therefore different compositions of the submatrices Z12 and Z22. Here, with the eigenvalues tii/sii
arranged in order of decreasing modulus, the diagonal elements of S22 will all be non-zero
provided that S has at least m non-zero eigenvalues, which we assume to be the case.11 Clearly,
for any solution under consideration to be dynamically stable, the eigenvalues of Ω must be
smaller than 1.0 in modulus. In McCallum (2007) it is shown that
(10)

Ω = Z22S22-1T22Z22-1

so Ω has the same eigenvalues as S22-1T22. The latter is triangular, moreover, so the relevant
eigenvalues are the m smallest of the 2m ratios tii/sii (given the decreasing-modulus ordering).
For dynamic stability, the modulus of each of these ratios must then be less than 1. [In many
cases, some of the m smallest moduli will equal zero.]
9

This invertibility condition, also required by King and Watson (1998) and Klein (2000), obtains except for
degenerate special cases of (1) that can be solved by simpler methods than considered here. Note that the
invertibility of H11 implies the invertibility of Z22, given that Z and H are unitary.
10
Note that it is not being claimed that all solutions are of the form (9).
11
From its structure it is obvious that A has at least m nonzero eigenvalues so, since Q and Z are nonsingular, S
must have rank of at least m. This necessary condition is not sufficient for S to have at least m nonzero eigenvalues,
however; hence the assumption.

5

Let us henceforth refer to the solution under the decreasing-modulus ordering as the
MOD solution. Now suppose that the MOD solution is stable. For it to be the only stable
solution, there must be no other arrangement of the tii/sii that would result in a Ω matrix with all
eigenvalues smaller in modulus than 1.0. Thus each of the tii/sii for i = 1,…, m must have
modulus greater than 1.0, some perhaps infinite. Is there some m×m matrix whose eigenvalues
relate cleanly to these ratios? Yes, it is the matrix F ≡ (I − AΩ)-1A, which appears frequently in
the analysis of Binder and Pesaran (1995, 1997).12 Regarding this F matrix, it is shown that, for
any ordering such that H11 is invertible, including the MOD ordering, we have the equality
(11)

H11 F H11-1 = T11-1S11,

which implies that F has the same eigenvalues as T11-1S11. In other words, it is the case that the
eigenvalues of F are the same, for any given arrangement of the system’s eigenvalues, as the
inverses of the values of tii/sii for i = 1, …, m. Under the MOD ordering these are the inverses of
the first (largest) m of the eigenvalues of the system’s matrix pencil. Accordingly, for solution
(9) to be the only stable solution, all the eigenvalues of the corresponding F must be smaller than
1.0 in modulus. This result, stated in different ways, is well known from Binder and Pesaran
(1995), King and Watson (1998), and Klein (2000), and is an important generalization of one
result of Blanchard and Khan (1980) for a model with nonsingular A.
Thus we have established notation for models of form (1)-(2) and have reported results
showing that the existence of a unique stable solution requires that all eigenvalues of the defined
Ω matrix and the corresponding F must be less than 1.0 in modulus. It will be convenient to

express that condition as follows: all λΩ < 1 and all λF < 1.

12

There is no general proof of invertibility of [I − AΩ], but if AΩ were by chance to have some eigenvalue exactly
equal to 1.0, that condition could be eliminated by making some small adjustment to elements of A or C. Also, see
Section 5 below.

3. E-Stability in Two Cases

We now turn to conditions for learnability under two different information assumptions.
First we will review the main results from my JEDC paper, which assumes that agents have full
information on current values of endogenous variables during the learning process, and then we
will go on to the second assumption, namely, that only lagged values of endogenous variables
are known during the learning process. The manner in which learning takes place in the EvansHonkapohja (E&H) analysis is as follows. Agents are assumed to know the structure of the
economy as specified in equations (1) and (2), in the sense that they know what variables are
included, but do not know the numerical values of the parameters. What they need to know, to
form expectations, is values of the parameters of the solution equations (3). In each period t,
they form forecasts on the basis of least squares regression of the variables in yt-1 on previous
values of yt-2 and any exogenous observables. Given those regression estimates, however,
expectations of yt+1 may be calculated assuming knowledge of yt or, alternatively, assuming that
yt-1 is the most recent observation possessed by agents and thus usable in the forecasting process.
In the former case, the conditions for E-stability reported by E&H (2001, p. 238) are that the
following three matrices must have all eigenvalues with real parts less than 1.0:
(12a) F ≡ (I − AΩ)-1A
(12b) [(I − AΩ)-1C]’ ⊗ F
(12c) R’ ⊗ F.
In the second case, however, the analogous condition (E&H, 2001, p. 245) is that the following
matrices must have all eigenvalues with real parts less than 1.0:
(13a) A(I + Ω)
(13b) Ω’⊗A + I ⊗AΩ

7

(13c) R’⊗A + I ⊗AΩ.
Except in the case that Ω = 0, which will obtain when C = 0, these conditions are not equivalent to
those in (12).
It is important to note that use of the first information assumption is not inconsistent with
a model specification in which supply and demand decisions in period t are based on
expectations formed in the past, such as Et-1yt+j or Et-2yt+j. It might also be mentioned
parenthetically that conditions (12) and (13) literally pertain to the E-stability of the model (1)(2)
under the two information assumptions, not its learnability. Under quite broad conditions,
however, E-stability is necessary and sufficient for LS learnability. This near-equivalence is
referred to by E&H as the “E-stability principle” (E&H, 1999, p. 472; 2001, p. 41). Since Estability is technically easier to verify, applied analysis typically focuses on it, rather than on
direct exploration of learnability.
Given the foregoing discussion, it is a simple matter to verify that if a model of form
(1)(2) is determinate, then it satisfies conditions (12). First, determinacy requires that all
eigenvalues of F must have modulus less than 1.0, so their real parts must all be less than 1.0,
thereby satisfying (12a). Second, from equation (4) it can be seen that (I − AΩ)-1C = Ω.
Therefore, matrix (12b) can be written as Ω’ ⊗ F. Furthermore, it is a standard result (Magnus
and Neudecker, 1988, p. 28) that the eigenvalues of a Kronecker product are the products of the
eigenvalues of the relevant matrices (e.g., the eigenvalues of Ω’ ⊗ F are the products λΩλF).
Therefore, condition (12b) holds. Finally, since λF < 1, condition (12c) holds provided that all
λR ≤ 1, which we have assumed by specifying that (2) is dynamically stable.

Determinacy does not imply learnability, however, under the second information
assumption. This point, which is developed by E&H (2001, pp. 174-181), can be illustrated by

8

means of a bivariate example.13 Let the yt vector in (1) include two variables, y1t and y2t, related
by the dynamic model that follows:

Then for the MOD solution we have

, which has
0.0893 

(complex) eigenvalues 0.1249 ± 0.2717 i. Inspection of these shows that this solution is
determinate, and that conditions (12a) and (12b), relevant for E-stability in the case in which
current information is available during learning, are satisfied. Let us assume R = 0, i.e., white
noise disturbances, for simplicity. Then the determinate RE solution is E-stable and learnable
under the first information assumption.
But for the case with only lagged information during learning, we need to consider the
eigenvalues of the matrices shown in expressions (13). For (13a), the matrix A(I + Ω) is
 −0.0112
1.0125

− 0.0089 
whose eigenvalues are −0.0030 and 1.0918. The last of these violates the
1.0999 

condition for (13a), however, so under the lagged-information assumption the relevant Estability condition is not satisfied and the determinate RE equilibrium is not LS learnable.
This result exemplifies the fact that determinacy is not generally sufficient for learnability
of RE solutions, although it is sufficient under the first information assumption. Of equal
importance, in my opinion, is the fact that determinacy is not necessary for learnability. In
13

Its specification is close numerically to the qualitative version of the E&H example that is used in McCallum
(2007, pp. 1386-1388).

9

particular, the MOD solution can be learnable, and be the only learnable solution of form (3), in
cases in which indeterminacy prevails. One such example is given in my JEDC paper on p.
1386.14 In such cases, the position that learnability is necessary for a solution to be plausible
would suggest that there may be no problem implied by the absence of determinacy.15
4. Well-Formulated Models

In an unpublished working paper (McCallum, 2003b), I have suggested that there is a
distinct and neglected property that dynamic models should possess to be considered “wellformulated” and plausible for the purpose of economic analysis. To begin the discussion,
consider first the single-variable case of specification (1),
(16)

yt = aEtyt+1 + cyt-1 + ut,

with ut = (1−ρ)η + ρut-1 + wt with ρ < 1 and wt white noise. Thus ut is an exogenous forcing
variable with an unconditional mean of η (assumed nonzero) and units have been chosen so that
there is no constant term. Applying the unconditional expectation operator to (16) yields
(17)

E yt = aEyt+1 + cEyt-1 + η.

In this case yt will be covariance stationary, and we have
(18)

E yt = η/ [1− (a + c)].

But from the latter, it is clear that as a + c approaches 1.0 from above, the unconditional mean of
yt approaches −∞ (assuming without loss of generality that η > 0), whereas if
a + c approaches 1.0 from below, the unconditional mean approaches +∞. Thus there is an
infinite discontinuity at a + c = 1.0. This implies that a tiny change in a + c could alter the
average (i.e., steady state) value Eyt from an arbitrarily large positive number to an arbitrarily
14

I take this opportunity to point out that McCallum (2007, p. 1386), errs in stating that when the eigenvalues are …
“30.65, −0.532, −0.123, and 0.000 … both stable solutions are learnable.” Actually, only the MOD solution is
learnable.
15
Disregarding, that is, “sunspot” solutions not of form (3).

10

large negative number. Such a property seems highly implausible and therefore unacceptable for
a well-formulated model.16 The substantive problem is not eliminated, obviously, by adoption of
the zero-measure exclusion a + c ≠ 1.
In light of the foregoing observation, it is my contention that, to be considered well
formulated (WF), the model at hand needs to include a restriction on its admissible parameter
values; a restriction that rules out a + c = 1, and yet admits a large interval of values that includes
(a, c) = (0, 0). In the case at hand, the appropriate restriction is a + c < 1. Of course, a + c > 1
would serve just as well mathematically to avoid the infinite discontinuity, but it seems clear that
a + c < 1 is vastly more appropriate from an economic perspective since it includes the values (0,
0).17 Since we want this condition to apply to a + c sums between zero and that value that
pertains to the model at hand, our requirement for WF is that a and c satisfy 1 − ε(a + c) > 0 for
all 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1. [It should be clear, in addition, that the foregoing argument could be easily
modified to apply to yt processes that are trend stationary, rather than strictly (covariance)
stationary.] It is shown in McCallum (2003b) that under this requirement, plus a second one to
be discussed shortly, the univariate model (16) is invariably E-stable.18
Next, for the bivariate case of model (1), extension of the foregoing WF property requires
that A and C are such that det[I − ε(A + C)] is positive for all 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1; otherwise the steadystate values of the variables may possess infinite discontinuities. But there are other
requirements as well. Let acij temporarily denote the ijth element of A + C. Then the model
with y1 = Ey1t , y 2 = Ey 2t , η1 = Eu1t, and η2 = Eu2t implies
16

The model could be formulated with the exogenous variable also written in terms of percent or fractional
deviations from the reference level η, e.g., û t = ut − η. But that would not alter the relationship between Eyt and η,
which can be extremely sensitive to tiny changes in a + c.
17
In models of the linear form (16), one would expect coefficients a and c typically to represent elasticities and often
to be numerically small relative to 1.
18
That paper’s analysis of multivariate systems is, however, unsatisfactory.

where ∆ = det[I − (A + C)] = (1−ac11)(1−ac22) − ac12ac21. Then the counterpart of the univariate
requirement that 1 − ε (a+c) > 0 includes the condition ∆ > 0 [for all 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1].19 We must
rule out, however, the case in which ∆ > 0 results from 1−εac11 and 1−εac22 both being
negative.20 The condition on ∆ should be extended, therefore, to also require 1−εac11 > 0 and
1−εac22 > 0.
How are these WF requirements extended to pertain to cases with more than two
variables? It appears that the appropriate requirement is that [I − ε(A+C)] must be a
P-matrix, which by definition has all its principal minors positive and thereby imposes the
conditions discussed for the cases above in which m equals 1 and 2. Other properties of any
P-matrix are that its inverse exists and is itself a P-matrix, and that all its real eigenvalues are
positive.21
An alternative possibility that is of interest would be to require that [I − ε(A + C)] must
be a positive dominant-diagonal matrix.22 This requirement would have implications for the Estability status of the model, as will be discussed below, and positive dominant-diagonal (PDD)
matrices have an important tradition in dynamic economics stemming from the literature on
multimarket stability analysis. This condition is, however, somewhat stronger than is actually
19

Henceforth the bracketed condition is to be understood wherever relevant.
This is clear for the case in which A + C is a diagonal matrix.

are hyper-sensitive to parameter values.
As a brief but relevant digression, one example of a matrix that is a P-matrix and yet is
not positive dominant-diagonal is as follows:

(21)

 0.08 − 0.92 0.90 
 0.92 0.07 −0.03  .


 −0.72 0.30 0.04 

Clearly, the entries in any row show immediately that this matrix is not positive dominant
diagonal (PDD). But its determinant is 0.3087 and the three second-order minors are 0.0118,
0.651, and 0.852. Since the diagonal elements are also all positive, the matrix is a P-matrix. For
future reference, we note that its eigenvalues are −0.0067 + 1.2319i, −0.0067 − 1.2319i, and
0.2034. Thus the example illustrates the fact that, although a P-matrix cannot have a negative
real eigenvalue, it can have a complex eigenvalue pair with negative real parts.23
Returning now to the main line of argument, there is a second type of discontinuity that
should also be eliminated for a model to be viewed as WF, namely, infinite discontinuities in its
impulse response functions. In model (1)(2) with solution (3), the impulse response to the shock
vector ut (3) involves the matrix Γ, which is given by
(22)

Γ = AΩΓ + AΓR + D.

Thus (I − AΩ)Γ = AΓR + D so using F = (I − AΩ)-1A, equation (22) can be written as
(23)

Γ = FΓR + (I −AΩ)-1D.

Then using the well-known identity that, for any conformable matrix product ABC, it is true that
vec ABC = (C '⊗ A) vec B,24 we have

(24)

vec Γ = (R '⊗ F) vec Γ + vec [(I − AΩ)-1D]

implying
(25)

vec Γ = [I − (R '⊗ F) ]-1 vec [(I − AΩ)-1D].

Accordingly, our second WF requirement is for [I − (R '⊗ F) ] and (I − AΩ) to be well behaved
in the same manner as I − (A + C), i.e., that each is a P-matrix. Again it is of interest to consider
the possibility of requiring that each of these is a PDD matrix.
5. E-Stability in WF Models?

In this section, the concern is with the relationship between models that are WF and those
in which the MOD solution is learnable. That there may be some significant relationship is
suggested by the following identity,
(26)

(I − AΩ)(I − F)(I − Ω) = I − (A + C),

which is mentioned by B&P (1995, fn. 34).25 From this equation we see that that non-singularity
of I − (A + C) implies that the three matrices (I − AΩ), (I − F), and (I − Ω) are all nonsingular.
In addition, we can see that the WF requirement that det[I − ε(A + C)] is positive for all 0 ≤ ε ≤
1 also implies that the real eigenvalues of Ω, AΩ, and F are all less than 1.0 in value.26 To make
that argument, consider the situation when A and C are multiplied by ε, 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1. For very
small values of ε, the matrices Ω, AΩ, and F will all be small so the eigenvalues of all four
matrices in (26) will be close to 1.0 and their determinants will be positive. Now let ε increase
and approach 1.0. If I − ε(A + C) remains nonsingular throughout this process, so too will each
of the three matrices on the left-hand side of (26). Since a real eigenvalue of zero would imply

25

The identity can be verified by writing out F in the left side of (26), multiplying, cancelling, and inserting C for
Ω − AΩ2.
26
Here, and often in what follows, I use the fact that the eigenvalues of a matrix of form (I − B) satisfy λI−B = 1 − λB.

14

singularity for any of the matrices in question, and since eigenvalues are continuous functions of
the matrix elements, the stated result is valid.
Accordingly, the WF requirement that det[I − ε(A + C)] is positive for all 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1 also
implies that the real eigenvalues of Ω, AΩ, and F are all less than 1.0 in value. In addition, the
requirement that the matrix [I − (R '⊗ F) ] be a P-matrix implies that all the real eigenvalues of

(R '⊗ F) will be smaller than 1.0. Therefore, condition (12c), as well as (12a), is satisfied. What
about the remaining condition, for the current-information case, (12b)? Here we recognize that,
by rearrangement of (4), (I − AΩ)-1C = Ω. Accordingly, (12b) becomes Ω′ ⊗ F . But then note
that with the MOD ordering it is the case that all λΩ < 1/λF so all λΩλF < 1. But
λΩλF= λΩλF ≥ Re(λΩλF) so it follows that (12b) is invariably satisfied. Accordingly, we

see that, with current information available during the learning process, the MOD solution would
be learnable, when the model is WF, if all eigenvalues were real.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the real part of all complex eigenvalues will be
smaller than 1.0. The situation is described by Horn and Johnson (1991, p. 123) as follows: “if A
is a [n-by-n] P-matrix ... then every eigenvalue of A lies in the open angular wedge Wn ≡
{z = reiθ: θ < π − (π / n), r > 0} . Moreover, every point in Wn is an eigenvalue of some n-by-n
P-matrix.” But for n > 2, Wn includes points in the in the two left-hand quadrants in the complex
plane. Therefore, we cannot argue that, in general, the WF condition implies LS learnability for
the MOD solution.
In this regard we note that, since A and C are matrices of real numbers, I − (A + C) will
have only real eigenvalues if A + C is symmetric. And since eigenvalues are continuous
functions of the elements of the matrix in question, these eigenvalues will be real if A + C does
not depart too far from symmetry. Diagonal matrices are of course symmetric, so it is not
15

surprising that dominant-diagonal matrices have strong properties pertaining to their eigenvalues.
In particular, if a real matrix is positive diagonal dominant (PDD), i.e., is diagonal-dominant
with all diagonal elements positive, then all its eigenvalues will have positive real parts—see
Horn and Johnson (1985, p. 349). Accordingly, if we were to require (as mentioned above) that
I − (A + C), (I − AΩ), and [I − (R '⊗ F) ] were PDD, rather than just P-matrices, then learnability
would be implied. That possibility is not, however, justified by the line of argument used to
motivate the WF condition, i.e., by the desirability of ruling out infinite discontinuities in
impulse response functions (and the model’s steady-state values).
The argument, then, is that being WF is an additional, distinct, plausibility condition to be
required along with learnability. Only if a RE solution is both learnable, and results from a
model that is WF, would it be considered as a plausible candidate for a RE solution that might
prevail in reality. This may seem like a rather demanding requirement. But most realistic
models utilized in monetary policy analysis easily meet both of these conditions; difficulties
arise primarily in the case of zero-lower-bound situations, very strong policy responses to
expected future conditions, and other extreme conditions.
In any case, the potential attractiveness of the WF requirement, in addition to that of LS
learnability, is exemplified by an example considered for other purposes in McCallum (2004, p.
59). The example in Table 2 of that paper combines two univariate models of form (1)-(2), one
of which has two explosive solutions and the other of which has two stable solutions.27 Small
off-diagonal elements of the A and C matrices are added to make the combined model a bivariate
example that is not reducible (while barely changing the system eigenvalues). In this bivariate

27

Incidentally, in that paper’s equation (29), the lower-left element of C is 0.3, not 0.5.

16

model it is found that there is a unique stable solution.28 Under the current-information
assumption, then, this equilibrium is learnable as well as determinate. It hardly seems plausible,
however, to believe that the combination of an explosive sector plus an indeterminate sector,
with only minimal interaction between them, would result in overall behavior reflecting a wellbehaved, unique equilibrium. Thus the finding that the determinate and learnable solution
pertains to a model that is not well-formulated, is highly relevant and leads to a conclusion that
seems entirely sensible.29 The appropriate conclusion is that this solution is not plausible. The
other solution (of form (3)) is the MSV solution. It is learnable but not dynamically stable.30
Thus the conclusion of an analysis based on the requirement that a plausible RE equilibrium
must be stable, learnable, and WF is that the system under discussion has no such equilibrium.
That seems eminently sensible, for a model that is the combination of one explosive sector and
one indeterminate sector with very little interaction.
Next we consider learnability for WF models under the second information assumption,
for which the relevant conditions are that all eigenvalues of the matrices in (13a)-(13c) have real
parts less than 1.0. Let us assume that I − (A + C), (I − AΩ), and [I − (R '⊗ F) ] are all PDD
matrices, which makes the MOD solution both learnable and WF. First consider (13a), which
implies that I − A(I + Ω) must have all eigenvalues with real parts that are positive. Using the
definition of F, we can write
(27)

(I − AΩ)(I − F) = (I − AΩ)[I − (I − AΩ) −1 A] = (I − AΩ) − A = I − A(I + Ω).

Now, our discussion above indicates that I − AΩ and I − F will both have eigenvalues with all

28

Which differs from the minimum-state-variable (MSV) solution in the sense of McCallum (2003b).
The non-WF conclusion is based on violations of both steady-state and impulse response requirements. For the
other solution of form (3), the steady-state WF conditions are violated.
30
For learning of explosive solutions a modified condition pertaining to shock variances is required. See E&H
(2001, pp. 219-220).
29

17

real parts positive under the WF assumption, so (27) indicates that this property would carry over
to I − A(I + Ω). This would not be the case, however, if we only specified that I − (A + C),
(I − AΩ), and [I − (R '⊗ F) ] are P-matrices.
Even in the more favorable case, with PDD matrices, I have not been able to find any
general results pertaining to conditions (13b) and (13c). The problem is that sums of Kronecker
products do not in general yield matrices for which eigenvalues are cleanly related to those of the
individual matrices. Nevertheless, there are two special cases that can be treated readily. First,
consider the case in which C = 0, so there are no predetermined variables in the solution, which
implies that Ω = 0.

Then we have F = (I − AΩ)-1A = A and thus (13a) becomes the same as

(12a). Furthermore, (13b) is irrelevant with Ω = 0 and (13c) becomes (R '⊗ A) , which is the
same as in (12c). So in this case, the two information assumptions yield the same E-stability
conditions. Second, suppose that C ≠ 0, but that the exogenous variables are white noise, i.e.,
R = 0. Then (13c) becomes (I ⊗ AΩ) and the result based on (I − AΩ)-1 shows that this
condition will be satisfied if the latter matrix is PDD. But conditions pertaining to (13a) and
(13b) are not necessarily satisfied. Of course, it is a simple matter to examine specific cases
numerically.
6. General Issues

A number of possible objections to the foregoing argument need to be addressed.
Probably the most prominent among researchers in the area would be the fact that our analysis
has been concerned only with solutions of form (3), which excludes sunspot solutions of the
“resonant frequency” type. It is my position, however, that the learning process pertaining to
solutions of this type is much less plausible than for solutions of form (3). In particular, the
solutions are not of the standard vector-autoregression (VAR) form. Therefore, an agent who

18

experimented with many different specifications of VAR models, using the economy’s generated
time series data, would still not be led to such a solution. Indeed, it seems to me that arguments
suggesting that that type of learning could exist in actual economies are utterly implausible. Of
course, literally speaking, RE itself is implausible—as early critics emphasized. Nevertheless
RE is rightly regarded by mainstream researchers as the appropriate assumption for economic
analysis, especially policy analysis. That is the case because RE is fundamentally the
assumption that agents optimize with respect to their expectational behavior, just as they do
(according to neoclassical economic analysis) with respect to other basic economic activities
such as selection of consumption bundles, selection of quantities produced and inputs utilized,
etc.—for a necessary condition for optimization is that individuals eliminate any systematically
erroneous component of their expectational behavior. Also, RE is doubly attractive (to
researchers) from a policy perspective, for it assures that a researcher does not propose policy
rules that rely upon policy behavior that is designed to exploit patterns of suboptimal
expectational behavior by individuals.
Another issue is the possible use of learning behavior not as a device for assessing the
plausibility of rational expectations equilibria, but as a replacement for the latter. This type of
approach is discussed by E&H (2001, Ch. 14) and has been prominent in the work of Orphanides
and Williams (2005), among others. Use of constant-gain learning (E&H, 2001, pp. 338-341)
provides a sensible alternative to the decreasing-gain learning implicit in the LS learning/Estability literature. I do not believe, however, that this approach solves the “startup” problem,
i.e., the issue of how the economy will behave in the first several periods following the adoption
of a new policy rule or the occurrence of some other structural change. I doubt that economies
move promptly to new RE equilibria following such a change, and I would doubt that they move

19

promptly to a modelled learning path. In both cases, I share the opinion voiced by Lucas (1980),
to the effect that, after a structural change (including policy regime changes), reliable analysis
should pertain to the economy’s behavior after it has had time to settle into a new dynamic
stochastic equilibrium.
7. Conclusion

Let us now conclude with a very brief review of the points developed above. First, the
paper reviews a previous result to the effect that, under the “first” information assumption that
agents possess knowledge of current endogenous variables in the learning process, determinacy
of a RE equilibrium is sufficient but not necessary for least-squares learnability of that
equilibrium. Thus, since learnability is an attractive necessary condition for plausibility of any
equilibrium, there may exist a single plausible RE solution even in cases of indeterminacy. In
addition, the paper proposes and outlines a distinct criterion that plausible models should possess,
termed “well formulated” (WF), that rules out infinite discontinuities in the model’s implied
steady-state values of endogenous variables and in its impulse response functions. The paper
then explores the relationship between this WF property and learnability, under the first
information assumption, and finds that (although they often agree) neither implies the other.
Extending the P-matrix requirement, implied for specified matrices by the WF property, to one
that demands positive dominant-diagonal matrices would guarantee both WF and learnability,
but a suitable rationale for such a requirement has not been found. Finally, under the second
information assumption, which gives the agents only lagged information on endogenous
variables during the learning process, the situation is less favorable in the sense that learnability
can be guaranteed only under special assumptions.

20

Appendix A

To demonstrate that a very wide variety of linear RE models can be written in form (1)(2),
consider the formulation of King and Watson (1998) or Klein (2001), as exposited by McCallum
(1998), as follows:
*
 A11
(A-1) 
0

0
I 

 E t x t +1   B11 B12   x t  G1 
k
 = 
   +   [ vt ] .
 t +1   B21 B22   k t  G 2 

Here vt is an AR(1) vector of exogenous variables (including shocks) with stable AR matrix R
while xt and kt are m1×1 and m2×1 vectors of non-predetermined and predetermined endogenous
variables, respectively. We assume without significant loss of generality that B11 is invertible31
and that G2 = 0.32 Then we define yt = [xt’ kt’ xt-1’ kt-1’]’ and write the system in form (1) with
ut = vt and the matrices given as follows:
−1 *
 B11
A11

0
(A-2) A11 = 
0




0 


0 


This representation is important because it is well known that the system (A-1) permits, via use
of auxiliary variables, any finite number of lags, expectational leads, and lags of expectational
leads for the basic endogenous variables. Also, any higher-order AR process for the exogenous
variables can be written in AR(1) form.33 Thus we have shown that the Evans and Honkapohja
(2001) formulation in their Section 10.3 is in fact rather general, although it does not pertain to
asymmetric information models.
31

For the system (A-1) to be cogent, each of the m1 non-predetermined variables must appear in at least one of the
m1 equations of the first matrix row. Then the diagonal elements of B11 will all be non-zero and to avoid
inconsistencies the rows of B11 must be linearly independent. This implies invertibility.
32
If it is desired to include a direct effect of vt on kt+1, this can be accomplished by definition of an auxiliary variable
(equal to vt-1) in xt (in which case vt remains in the information set for period t). Also, auxiliary variables can be used
to include expectations of future values of exogenous variables.
33
Binder and Pesaran (1995) show that virtually any linear model can be put in form (1), but in doing so admit a
more general specification than (2) for the process generating the exogenous variables.
