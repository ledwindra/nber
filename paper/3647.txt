WORK INCENTIVES AND THE DEMAND FOR
PRIMARY AND CONTINGENT LABOR
ABSTRACT
This paper presents an incentive-based dual labor market

model. Three implications of the model are emphasized. First,
in equilibrium, there is an excess suppiy of workers to primary

jobs. Second, when demand is uncertain, firms

may choose a mix

of primary and contingent workers to perform the same job, even

when these workers are perfect substitutes in production. Third,
firms prefer to hire into primary jobs workers with strong job
attachment and workers whose preferences lead them to prefer long

work hours. We argue that industries with high proportions of
part-time workers will tend to have large concentrations of

contingent workers. The empirical finding that the wages and
benefits of full-time workers are significantly reduced in
industries with large concentrations of part-time workers appears
consistent with this hypothesis.

I. INTRODUCTION
According to conventional microeconomic theory, identical commodities should sell for

the same price in a freely competitive market. Short-run deviations from this equilibrium
state will be competed away as buyers abandon high price commodities for their low price
equivalents.

The theory of dual labor markets argues this law of one price does not prevail in labor

markets. Instead market processes tend to produce "primary" jobs characterized by high
wages and long job tenure and "contingent" (or "secondary") jobs offering low wages and
short tenure. Equilibrium in dual labor market theory is characterized by an excess supply

of qualified workers to primary jobs. Mobility between contingent and primary jobs is
therefore limited and "good" workers may find themselves in "bad" jobs—perhaps for long
periods of time.

The theory of dual labor markets has generated a rich qualitative and quantitative
literature.' However, until recently, the development of a microeconomic theory of dual
labor markets has been limited by the absence of formal models explaining: (1) why firms
offer primary and contingent jobs and (2) how an excess supply of workers to primary jobs

persists in equilibrium.

Recently developed theoretical models have attempted to address these issues by
analysing the differences in work incentives used in primary and contingent jobs. The
models begin by postulating unobserved, cross industry variation in labor monitoring tech-

nolo' (see, for example, Bulow and Summers, 1986). Primary jobs arise in industries
where it is difficult to monitor job performance. These industries use dismissal threats to
motivate workers to provide high quality work effort.2 Since the effectiveness of dismissal
threats depends upon the cost to the worker of job loss, primary employers will be inclined

to set wages above market clearing levels. Contingent jobs, in contrast, occur where it is

easy to monitor the activities of workers. In this situation, employers do not rely upon
dismissal threats to maintain work intensity and wages tend towards market clearing levels.
1

This paper extends the work incentive approach to dual labor markets by introducing

uncertain product demand into an analysis of the demand for primary and contingent
workers. This innovation leads to the results that: (1) dual labor markets can arise even
in the absence of variation in monitoring technology across industries and (2) primary and
contingent workers need not be segregated into separate industries. Indeed, we demonstrate

that a single, profit maximizing firm may find it optimal to offer both contingent and
primary jobs. This mix of primary and contingent jobs may occur even when workers are
homogeneous and perfect substitutes in production.

The remainder of the paper proceeds in three sections. In section II, we present our

theoretical model of dual labor markets. In sections III and IV, we extend the model to
argue that. firms or industries with large concentrations of part-time workers will also have

large concentrations of contingent workers. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that
in industries with high concentrations of part-time workers, the wages and benefits of full
time workers are significantly reduced.

II. A MODEL OF DUAL LABOUR MARKETS

The logic of our dual labor market model can be briefly summarized. Firms create
incentives for their primary employees to work hard by dismissing workers who are discov-

ered to be putting forth substandard effort. These dismissal threats are made effective by
wage premia guaranteed to persist throughout the period of employment. The longer the
credible promise of future employment, the lower is the wage premium a firm must offer
to convince primary workers to work hard.
When firms face variations in product demand, there is a chance that these firms will

lay off some of their primary workers. Firms have an incentive to reduce the probability

of layoff because by so doing they increase anticipated job tenure and reduce the wage
premium paid to primary workers. These considerations motivate firms to hire contingent

workers on the spot market for labor. The contingent workers form a buffer of last-hired
2

first-fired workers that reduce the layoff probability (and therefore the wages) paid to
primary workers.3

For our purposes, it is analytically convenient to discuss work incentives in the form

of dismissal threats. The use of these threats are also consistent with the "employment at
will" legal doctrine governing United States labor law.4 However, the logic of our model

would not be fundamentally altered if the sanctions available to the firm rested upon
changes in the probability of promotion rather than changes in the probability of job
termination.
A. Primary and Contingent Employment Contracts
We consider firms that hire homogeneous workers under one of two types of employ-

ment contracts, primary or contingent. Under the contingent contract, workers are hired
with no promise of future employment. Firms pay contingent workers the wage that clears

the spot market for labor, w2. In contrast, primary workers are offered jobs that persist
until the worker is laid off due to a reduction in the firm's demand for labor or dismissed
for poor work effort. These workers are paid a wage set by the firm, w1.

Workers are presumed to work at two levels of intensity, "high" and "low". In any
period, a firm can always ascertain whether an employee is working below the minimal
level of work intensity. However, firms detect the minimal-effort work behavior only with

obability D < 1. Contingent workers, who have no future with the firm, will provide the
perfectly observable low level of work intensity. Primary workers, however, can be induced

to work at the high level of work intensity if the expected cost of dismissal for substandard

work exceeds the gain in utility from working at low intensity.

In order to highlight the incentive aspect of our model we assume that workers are
risk neutral. In particular, we assume that the utility workers derive from employment in

any period is u(w, e) = w — e, where w is the wage, and c is the level of effort expended
on the job. The level of work effort takes the value e1 if the intensity is high, and e2 if the
intensity is low. Of course, e1 — e2 > 0. Workers who provide low level of work effort are
3

said to be "shirking".
Due to fluctuations in product demand, primary workers are not assured continued
employment in their current jobs. In each period, workers who hold primary jobs face a
fixed probability, 6 < 1, of being laid off. The probability a non-shirking worker remains
in the primary job the next period is (1 — 6). By shirking, the worker risks detection and

dismissal, and thus reduces the probability of remaining in the primary job from (1 —
to (1 — b)(1

—

D). We assume that primary workers who loose their jobs always find

employment in a contingent job.
Workers make effort decisions consistent with the maximization of expected lifetime

utility. Let VN be the expected discounted flow of utility for a non-shirking worker in a

primary job, Vs be the present value of expected utility for a shirking worker in a primary

job, and Vc be the present value of expected utility for a worker employed in a contingent
job. If we adopt the assumption that workers are infinitely lived we can write:5

There are two implications of this no-shirking condition that we wish to emphasize.

First, the utility of employment in a primary job exceeds the utility of employment in a
secondary job. Thus in equilibrium there will be a persistent excess supply of contingent
workers who are able and willing to accept primary jobs at the prevailing wage. Second, we

notice that the wage paid primary workers varies positively with the layoff probability, b:

All else equal, firms that employ primary workers will prefer to reduce the probability that

any primary worker is laid off. The determinants of layoff probabilities are considered in
the next section.

B. Layoffs a a Response io Uncertain Product Demand

We consider firms whose revenue in any period is given by Pf(L1), where P is the

price of the output price, and 1(L1) is a concave function having as its only input the
firm's primary labor force, L1. Uncertainty is introduced into the model by allowing P to

be an i.i.d. draw from a known probability distribution, 4(P).
The timing of the model is as follows: At the beginning of each period firms offer L1

primary employment contracts at the wage w1. Firms and workers then learn the value of

the random price draw, P. At this point firms decide how many of the primary workers
hired cx ante they wish to lay off. With the labor force in place, production proceeds, and

workers are paid the promised wage. The number of workers a firm will lay off cx post

depends of course on the realized product price. If this draw is favorable, the firm will

retain all of the workers initially hired. On the other hand, if P is low, layoffs may be
necessary. Let L1(P) L1 represent the number of workers the firm retains as a function
of the realized price, P. Given this cx post retention policy, the probability of layoff for
any worker is7

b—

f(P)EL1 —L1(P)ldP
5

(6)

As we have noted, the no-shirking wage, solved in equation (4), depends on this layoff

probability. Firms thus face a tradeoff between the wage that it pays and the continuity
of employment offered. The greater a firm's reliance on layoffs in when demand is slack,
the higher will be the wage the firm must pay to assure no shirking.

We can explore this insight formally using functional derivatives. Given a firm's
retention rule, L1 (P), expected profit is

E(r) = J qS(P)Pf(Li(P))dP — wi(b)J 4(P)L1(P)dP,

(7)

where we have written w1 as a function of b to emphasize that the no shirking wage depends

on the layoff probability. Let L(P) represent the optimal retention policy for a firm, given

some initial ievel of hiring, L1, and let g(P) be a function representing a deviation from
this policy. Then if expected profits are expressed as

E(ir) =

f

5g(P))dP — wi(b) f qS(P)[L(P) + 5g(P)]dP,

(8)

it is clear that expected profits will be maximized when S equals zero. Moreover, the first
order condition,

dE(ir)
must hold for any g(P) when L1(P) is set to its optimal path, L(P). This first order
condition thus implies

j

L c6(P)Pf'(L(P))g(P)dP —

4(P)L(P)dP —

L qS(P)g(P)dP = 0.

(9)

Using equations (4), (5), and (6) we rewrite this expression,

+

f 4(P)g(P)[Pf'(L(P)) +

—

wi]dP = 0.

(10)

For (10) to be hold for any g(P), it must be the case that whenever layoffs are utilized

by a firm, the number of workers retained, L(P), satisfies

This suggests that in the event of slack demand, the optimal strategy for a firm is to hoard
labor, i.e., to retain workers for whom the value of marginal product is less than the wage.

Notice that this labor hoarding occurs even though firms have not made any investment
in firm-specific human capital. Put differently, the use of dismissal based incentives causes

firms to act as if they had invested in the skills of their incumbant work force.
C. The Demand for Contingent Workers: A Cobb-Douglas Example

In the previous section, we study how firms respond to variations in product demand

by laying off primary workers. In this section we also consider the possibility that finns

may respond to variations in product demand by hiring contingent workers on the spot
market for labor.
We modify our model only slightly.. Suppose revenue accruing to the firm is P1(L),

where L is the firm's "effective" labor input. We assume that primary and contingent
workers are perfect substitutes in production:

L=Li+aL2,

O<o<1,

where L2 is the number of contingent workers used by the firm, and

(12)

indicates the

productivity of these workers relative to that of primary workers.

With this set-up a variety of outcomes are possible. If w2/c < w1 firms will never
offer primary contracts. On the other hand, if w2/cr > w firms may decide to either make
exclusive use of primary workers or to make use of both primary and contingent workers.
We illustrate this latter possibility with the following example.
Suppose the firm's output is produced according to Cobb-Douglas technology:
f(L1 + cxL2) = (L1

+ 0L)6

(13)

The firm selects L1, the initial number of primary contracts offered, so as to maximize
expected profit. Once the output price is realized, the firm adjusts cx post labor utilization,

L1 and L2, in a manner consistent with expected profit maximization. (Notice that output
7

is a function of the cx post labor utilization—the workers actually used in the production
process.)

We can derive the cx post labor demand for primary workers, given the cx ante hiring

of primary workers, L1, as follows. From equation (11), we know that if the price is low
enough so that layoffs occur, the firm will adjust its use of primary labor so that the value
of marginal product equals t1, where

(14)

or, equivalently (using equation 4),

(15)

Define the price P1 to be the price below which the firm begins to use layoffs:

=

(16)

Then the cx post demand function for primary workers is

ifP<P1;

if P> P1.

(17)

We find the cx post demand for contingent labor in similar fashion. If the realized
price is high enough, fIrms find it advantageous to supplement its core of primary workers

with contingent labor. In particular, let P2 be the price above which a firm will wish to
use contingent labor, given the firm's cx ante employment of L1:

=

(18)

Then the cx post demand function for contingent workers is

ifP<P2;
ifP>P2.

0,

8

(19)

Two features of these labor demand functions are worth noting. First, both P1 and
P2 are increasing functions of L1. Decreases in the cx ante number of primary contracts
offered reduce the range of prices for which layoffs occur and increases the range for which

contingent labor is utilized. Second, notice that P2 > P1. This implies that there exist a
range of demand within which employment is rigid. Specifically, if the realized price falls

between P1 and P2, the firm will retain a fixed number of primary workers, and will hire
no contingent labor.

For our example, we take the output price to be a random variable distributed uniformly between 0 and 1. Thus the expected utilization of primary labor, conditional on
the quantity of primary labor hired cx ante is

E(L1) =

j (--) dP + J L1dP.

(20)

Evaluating this expression, we find that the layoff probability for a primary worker is
b— 1 —

E(L1)

(2-8)8

L1

Not surprisingly, the layoff probability is an increasing function of the cx ante labor
hiring decision, L1. When offering these contracts firms must consider a tradeoff: Increasing L1 results in a higher layoff probability and thus a higher no-shirking wage, but also on

average reduces the number of (relatively costly) contingent workers that will be utilized.

Given the production technology and price distribution in our example, expected
profits are

(22)

Using expressions (16) through (19) and (21), we can evaluate the integrals, and derive
the expected profits as a function of a firm's cx ante employment of primary workers, Lj:

[2 — 2(2—8)]

L — (1 — b)wj (b)L1 +

() . (23)

As we have noted, if the unit cost of contingent workers (w2/a) is very high relative to
primary workers, firms will strictly rely on primary workers. Conversely, if the relative cost

of contingent workers is very low, firms will abandon incentives and hire only contingent

workers. Expression (23) allows us to illustrate a third possibility—that there are many
sets of parameters for which an individual firm will hire a mix of primary and contingent

workers. Figure 1 illustrates one particular case. We set a = 0.5, 9 = 0.7,

e1 — e2

=

2,

D = 0.5, r = 0.01, and s = 0.02. The market clearing wage for contingent labor, w2 is
$7.00. Given these parameters, we plot expected profits as a function of L1. This expected

profit function has a maximum at L1 = 152. The firm will supplement this primary labor
force whenever the output price exceeds $0.75, and will lay off primary workers when the

price falls below $0.27. In our example, the primary wage offered by the firm is $10.19.
[Figure 1 about here.)

These results illustrate a striking property of our dual labor market model. A profit
maximizing firm may hire a mix of perfectly substitutable primary and contingent labor

inputs even when these inputs have different prices. In an environment with uncertain
product demand, one may therefore find contingent workers and primary workers at work

in the same firm or industry.
III. PART-TIME WORK AND CONTINGENT WORKERS

In the United States it is very difficult to identify which workers are working under
conditions resembling primary or contingent employment contracts. No official government

statistics are kept on contingent or primary workers and many of the relevant aspects of
employment relationships are implicit and therefore not recorded by firms. This section
presents theoretical and empirical considerations arguing that part-time workers will tend

to be contingent workers.

A. Primary Jobi and Quit Propensitic
An easy modification to our model involves introducing the possibility that workers

in primary jobs may leave their positions for reasons other than being fired or laid off.
Following Bulow and Summers (1986), we assume that workers have an exogenously determined probability of quitting a primary job, q. The no-shirking condition can be solved
for this case:

= w2 + (e1 — e2) + (ei —e2)(r+s+&+q)
—
D(l — b)(1

(24)

q)

Notice that the higher a worker's quit propensity, q, the higher will be the wage needed to
assure no shirking. To the extent that part-time workers have a more tenuous commitment
to the labor market, such workers will tend to be expensive primary workers. All else equal,

firms will avoid using such workers to fill primary positions.

B. De3ired Hotrs of Work and ike No-Shirking Wage

Our model has so far abstracted from the determination of work hours. Once hours
of work, N, are introduced, we express a worker's utility as a function of income, wN, the

disutility of work effort, which is now a function of work hours, e(N), and the amount of
leisure itself. For simplicity, we adopt a quasi-linear utility function:

u(w,e,N)= U(wN—e)+G(A—N),

G' >0, C" <0, e' >0, e" <0,

(25)

where G(J — N) is the utility of leisure when an individual works N of J available hours.

Defining the work hours in primary and contingent jobs as respectively N1 and N2
hours, and maintaining the assumption of risk neutrality in income, the no-shirking condition becomes
—
—

e1(Ni) +

E(Ni)(r+s+b+q) + w2N2—e2(N2)
+ G(JTN2)_G(JN1)

(1— b)(1 — q)D(Nj)N1

N1

MN1

(26)

where M is the marginal utility of income, E(N1) = ei(Ni) — e2(N1), and D(N1) is the
probability in each period of detection and dismissal for shirking primary workers who
work N1 hours.

To highlight the role played by differences in preferences for income and leisure, we

assume that E(N) and D(N) are each linear functions of hours worked.8 In this situation,
11

workers in both primary and contingent jobs will choose work hours such that the marginal

utility of income equals the marginal utility of leisure.

Differentiating equation (26) with respect to M, we discover that

dG(Jcr_N1)_G(J_N2)

dM

M2N1

27

Given our utility function, N1 exceeds N2, and thus dwi/dM <0.

The finding that dwi/dM < 0 has strong intuitive appeal. The effectiveness of dismissal threats rests on denying shirking workers access to high future income streams. All

else equal, one would expect that workers with higher marginal utilities of income would

require a smaller wage premium (and therefore a smaller w1) to assure no shirking. The
implication is that workers who place a high value on money relative to leisure, i.e., work-

ers with preferences for longer hours, will be cheaper primary workers. Even if part-time
workers have the same turnover rates as full-time workers, part-time workers will thus be
less desirable for primary positions.

C. Do Part-Timers Resemble Contingent Workers?

The hypothesis that part-time workers are concentrated in contingent positions is
indirectly supported by data indicating that as a group, part-time workers have many of
the characteristics one would associate with contingent workers. Aggregate data suggests

that part-time workers have a more tenuous connection to their employers than do fulltime workers. Data from a recent U.S. survey, presented in Row 7 of Table 1 indicates that

on average, the current job tenure of part-time workers (3.4 years) is considerably shorter

than that of either female (5.7 years) or male (8.1 years) full-time workers. Row 8 also
suggests that part-time employees have a weaker attachment to the labor force than do
full-timers. Of those part-timers employed in 1983, 28.4 percent had left the labor force 12

months later. This figure compares with 5.3 percent and 2.9 percent for female and male
full-timers respectively.9

(a) The definition of part-time work used in this study differs slightly from
the official Bureau of Labor Statistics definition. The BLS counts as part-time
workers those who worked less than 35 hours per week in all jobs during the
survey week. This pool is then divided into those who work part-time for
economic reasons and those who work part-time voluntarily. The former group
is typically counted as part of the full-time labor force. Nardone (1986) argues
that a superior definition of part-time work would count as part-time all those
who usually work less than 35 hours per week, regardless of reason. Nardones
cutoff however is based on the number of hours worked at iJ jobs. In
contrast this study counts as part-time all workers who usually work less than
35 hours per week at their primary job. Since wage, tenure and benefit data
all refer to the primary job, this definition is more appropriate in comparing
full-time and part-time workers.

Population Survey described in the text.

(c) Percentage of wage and salary employees in the non-agricultural, nonhousehold, private sector in May 1983 who were reported not-in the labor
force during the survey week 12 months after the original CPS survey.
Averages were constructed by matching the May 1983 respondents with those in
the1984 Current Population survey "earnings" file. This file contains the
survey responses of all individuals in outgoing rotations in 1984. See Table 4
for details.

The preceding discussion suggests that workers with high quit propensities or workers

whose preferences lead them to choose shorter work hours will, all else equal, be expensive

primary workers. These individuals will be concentrated in the contingent labor force and
will be more likely to be in part-time positions. The data presented in rows 1, 2, and 3 are

consistent with these expectations. As a group part-timers are more female, young (less
than 21 years old) and old (older that 65) than full-timers.

In addition to reduced job security and labor force attachments, part-time workers
resemble contingent workers in having generally lower levels of wages and benefits. Row 4

of Table I compares the hourly wages of part time and full time workers. In our survey,
the average wage of part-timers ($5.48) was considerably less than that of full-time females
($6.57) and males ($9.74). Similarly, part-timers were less likely to receive health insurance

and pension benefits than full-time workers.
IV. CONTINGENT EMPLOYMENT AND THE WAGES OF FULL TIME WORKERS

Our dual labor market model suggests that in general primary and contingent workers will be found working in the same industry. Theoretical and empirical considerations
further suggest that part-time workers are likely to be contingent workers. However, not

all contingent workers will be part-time workers. In the absence of direct measures of
tlTe presence of full-time contingent workers, we hypothesize that sectors with a high con-

centration of part-time workers also will tend to have a high concentration of full-time
contingent workers.
This hypothesis appears to be supported by evidence from the one group of contingent
workers for whom direct data is available in the United States—employees in the temporary

help industry. Consistent with the definition of "contingent" developed in this paper,
Abraham (1987) found evidence indicating that employers use temporary workers (and

other kinds of flexible staffing arrangements) to help adjust to fluctuations in product
demand. A recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employees in the temporary
13

help industry found that the proportion of wage and salary workers who worked part time

in that industry was 40 percent—more than double the average for all wage and salary
workers (Howe, 1986).

If the presence of part-time workers is a good indicator of the presence of contingent

workers in general, then all else equal, the wages of full-timers ought to be lower in industries with large concentrations of part-time workers. To examine this hypothesis, we
estimate the following wage equation:

1og(w) =

B1

+ B2(PT/FT)1 + B3FACTORS1 + ,,

(28)

where log(w1) is the natural log of the hourly earnings of full time worker i, (PT/FT)1 is the

ratio of part-timers to full-timers in the industry, FACTORS is a vector of other factors
influencing hourly earnings, and E is the error term. Our hypothesis suggests B2 <0.

In this study, PT/FT is measured using the ratio of part-time to full-time workers
employed in two-digit census industries. FACTORS is composed of variables commonly
found in other wage studies to be important in determining hourly earnings. These include

characteristics of the worker, characteristics of the workplace, characteristics of the local

labor market, and characteristics of the industry and occupation. These variables are
described in a data appendix.
Column 1 of Table 2 presents ordinary least squares estimates of equation (28) for a
sample of over 7000 male, full-time workers. The coefficient on the key variable, PT/FT,

has a statistically significant negative sign, indicating that the larger the fraction of the
labor force employed part time, the lower are the wages paid to full-time male workers.
Point estimates suggest that this "part-time effect" on the wages of full-time male employ-

ees is substantial. All else equal, a one standard deviation in PT/FT will reduce hourly
earnings by 6.9 percent. At the mean wage in the sample ($9.87) this translates into $0.68
per hour, or $1,363 over a 2000 hour work year.

(b) Derivative of dependent variable with respect to PT/FT evaluated at the mean.

The coefficients on the remaining variables are not surprising. Tenure (TENURE and

TENURE2/100) and age (AGE and AGE2/100) have positive (and non-linear) effects on

wages. White workers (WHITE), union members (UNION), employees in large plants
(PLANT SIZE2—PLANT SIZE5) and workers in heavily male industries (%MALE) all
enjoy earnings significantly above those received by otherwise comparable workers. Union

concentration in the industry (%UNION) had a small and statistically insignificant effect
on hourly earnings.

Given these results, it is reasonable to ask if the presence of part-time workers in
an industry has a negative association with dimensions of the compensation package other
than hourly earnings. Column 2 of Table 2 presents logistic estimates of a health insurance

equation. The dependent variable, HEALTH INSURANCE, is a dichotomous variable

set equal to one if the respondent is included in a group health insurance plan at the
present job. As was the case in the wage equation, the coefficient on PT/FT is negative
and statistically significant. The magnitude of the effect appears also to be economically

significant. A one standard deviation increase in PT/FT will, all else equal, reduce the
probability that full-timers receive health insurance benefits by 3.3 percentage points.

As a rule, the remaining variables in the health insurance equation have measured
effects similar to their counterparts in the earnings equation. Respondents who were white,
or union members, or who worked at larger plants, all had a higher probability of receiving

health insurance benefits. Similarly, older, more tenured and better educated respondents

were more likely to be included in health insurance programs. Somewhat surprisingly,
the more male the full-time labor force in the industry, the less likely were workers to be
included in health insurance plans where they worked.

Column 3 of Table 2 presents logistic estimates of the determinants of pension cover-

age. The dependent variable, PENSION1, is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the
employer (or union) contributes to a pension or retirement plan for any of its employees (or

members). Since the availability of a pension plan at the employer is not influenced by the
15

current tenure of the respondent, TENURE and TENURE2/100 were not included in
the vector of variables which make up FACTORS. The estimates of the pension equation

are consistent with those of the health insurance equation. All else equal, workers in industries with large concentrations of part-timers are significantly less likely to be working
for employers who offer pensions plans. At the mean values of these variables, the deriva-

tive of the probability of a pension plan being offered with respect to PT/FT is -0.288.
This implies that a one standard deviation increase in PT/FT reduces the probability an
employer will offer a pension plan by 6.6 percentage points.

Column 4 of Table 2 examines workers employed at firms that offer pension plans in

order to analyze the probability that the employee will be included in the pension plan.

A logistic equation was estimated with the dependent variable, PENSION2, set equal
to one if the respondent is included in a pension plan and 0 otherwise. The statistically

significant negative coefficient on PT/FT indicates that, all else equal, full-time male
workers employed in a firm offering a pension plan are less likely to be included in that

plan if they work in an industry with a high concentration of part-time workers. The

magnitude of this effect, however, appears small. At the mean, the derivative of the
probability of inclusion in the pension plan relative to PT/FT is -0.029. This suggests

that a one standard deviation increase in PT/FT will reduce the probability of being
included in a pension plan by 0.5 percentage points.
Taken together, the estimates presented in Table 2 indicate that male full-time workers

experience significant reductions in both wages and the availability of health and pension
benefits if they work in industries with high concentrations of part-time workers. Table 3

presents estimates for full-time female workers analogous to those presented for males.

Examination of the results indicates that the pattern for women is very similar to that

found for men. Increasing the concentration of part-time workers in an industry: (1)
reduces female wages, (2) reduces the probability a woman will be included in a group

health plan, (3) reduces the probability a woman will work for an employer offering a

(Insert Table 3 about here.]

The negative association between various dimensions of compensation and the pres-

ence of part-time workers in the industry is consistent with the hypothesis that many
full-time workers in these industries are working under contingent employment contracts.
However, the results do not rule out the possible alternat;ive hypothesis that full-time work-

ers in industries with high concentrations of part-timers are less productive than workers

in other industries due to unmeasured personal or human capital characteristics. These
two hypotheses can be distinguished by examining how the wages of individuals change as

they change industries. If the "part-time effect" on wages were due entirely to spurious
correlation with unmeasured personal or human capital characteristics, it should disappear
in an empirical study tracking a single individual over time.10

By matching the responses of individuals included in both the May 1983 Current
Population Survey and the May and June 1984 Current Population Survey, we estimate a
wage change equation for the following form:

log(wj) = Co + C1(PT/FT) + C2LFACTORS1 + E,

(29)

where 1og(w) is the change in the log of hourly earnings for individual i between 1983

and 1984 multiplied by 100, LPT/FT is the change in the industry ratio of part-timers

to full-timers due to changes in industry status, and LFACTORS is a vector of other
variables that change over time and are plausibly linked to wages.

The estimates of equation (29) are presented in Table 4. Due to the small number
of individuals for whom job changes place them in different industries, male and female
respondents were pooled into a single equation. The results are consistent with the crosssection findings. The variable iPT/FT has a statistically significant negative sign indicating that a worker moving into an industry with higher concentrations of part-time workers

longitudinal data required to estimate wage change equations were obtained by
matching the respondents in the May 1983 Current Population Survey with those
in the 1984 Current Population Survey earnings file. This earnings file
contains the survey responses of all individuals in outgoing rotations for each
month in 1984. Respondents were matched by household i.d. number, tine

experiences a fall in earnings. The magnitude of the earnings loss, however, is smaller than

that implied by the cross-sectional estimates. Industry changes that increase PT/FT by
0.23 (about the one standard deviation change considered in the cross-sectional estimates)

reduces hourly earnings by 3.1 percent. This compares with the 6.9 percent predicted on
the basis of the cross sectional estimates presented in Table 2.

V. CONCLUSION

This paper has presented a model of dual labor markets in which jobs are difficult to
monitor and product demand is uncertain. Three implications of the model are emphasized.

First, in equilibrium, wages paid to primary workers will exceed those paid to contingent
workers and there will be an excess supply of workers to primary jobs. Second, depending
on monitoring and production technology, a firm may choose to hire all primary workers, all

contingent workers, or a mix of primary and contingent workers to perform the same job.

This property holds even when primary and contingent workers are perfect substitutes

in production. Third, firms will prefer to hire into primary jobs workers with low quit
rates and those workers whose preferences lead them to prefer long hours. Thus, part-time
workers will tend to hold contingent jobs—although not all contingent workers will be part

time.

Our model thus implies that within an industry, some mix of primary and contingent

jobs will typically exist. In industries with a high concentration of part-time workers,
a relatively large proportion of full-time workers will also be contingent workers. The
empirical finding that the wages and benefits of full-time workers are significantly reduced

in industries with large concentrations of part-time workers appears consistent with this
hypothesis.

The findings presented in this paper suggest a number of avenues for future research.
On an empirical level, it is important to construct more direct measures of the numbers of
18

primary and contingent workers and to estimate the extent of the excess supply of workers

for primary jobs. On a theoretical level, it would interesting to explore how different
macroeconomic regimes influence the quality of job offers by influencing firms' preferred
mix of primary and contingent workers.

1. See, for example, Doeringer and Piore (1971), Osterman (1975), Edwards (1979), Cor-

don, Edwards and Reich (1982), and Dickens and Lang (1985), as well as the studies
reviewed in Cain (1976) and Lang and Dickens (forthcoming).

2. Dismissal based effort-regulation models are part of the larger class of efficiency wage
models. Discussions of the properties of both efficiency wage and effort regulation models
include Stiglitz (1987), Bowles (1985), and Gintis and Ishikawa (1987). Of these papers,

our work is perhaps closest in spirit to Gintis and Ishikawa because of our interest in
endogenously determined employee exit probabilities. Gintis and Ishikawa focus on firms'
dismissal behavior, whereas we follow Rebitzer and Taylor (forthcoming) in examining the
implications of uncertainty for firms' layoff strategies.
3. Numerous analysts have noted that firms make use of various types of contingent workers
to buffer their primary work force from variations in product demand. See, for example,
Abraham (1986), Applebaum (1987), and Mangum, Mayall and Nelson (1985).
4. See Krueger (1989) for a discussion of the lack of employee protections against dismissal

in the United States.
5. These expressions presume that firms do not try to recall the primary workers they have
previously laid off. Layoffs and recall are commonly used in the United States and they
can be introduced into this model in a straight forward fashion. However, allowing firms
to recall laid off workers considerably complicates the mathematics of our model without
altering our fundamental conclusions. We therefore do not consider the issue of layoff and
recall in this paper.

6. This derivation of the no-shirking wage presumes that workers do not post performance

bonds and that workers are paid in each period prior to the observation of their work
activities in each period. The possible role played by performance bonds in labor markets
is controversial. For discussions of this issue see Lazear (1979), Lang (1989), Akerlof and
Katz (1989) and Dickens, Katz, Lang and Summers (1989).

7. This expression for the layoff probability is based on the simplifying assumption that
workers are laid off at random from the pool of primary workers hired cx ante.

8. Despite our concavity assumptions concerning ej(N) and e2(N), we cannot be cetain
about the shape of E(N). Similarly, D(N) can in general be either concave or convex. Relaxing assumptions that E(N) and D(N) are linear introduces the possibility that workers
in primary jobs may be "overworked" in the sense of working more hours than they would
optimally choose or "hours constrained" in the sense of working less than their optimal
hours. These issues are discussed at length in Rebitzer and Taylor (1990).

9. More detailed analysis also finds that job tenure is significantly reduced for parttime workers. Rebitzer (1986) presents an empirical examination of the determinants of
job tenure. In an unpublished appendix to Rebitzer's paper, it is reported that after
20

controlling for personal characteristics, compensation at the current job, alternative job
opportunities, non-wage union effects, education, job skills, and plant size, part-time status
reduced female job tenure by 14 percent and male job tenure by 10 percent.
10. Freeman (1984) points out that measurement error is likely to increase in wage change

equations. This error will tend to depress the observed "part-time effect" even in the
absence of unmeasured personal characteristics.
