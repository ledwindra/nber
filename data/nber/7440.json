    "abstract": "\n\nThe objective of this paper is to find the quantitative importance of some predictors of mortality among the population aged 70 or over.  The predictors are socio-economic indicators (income, wealth and education), thirteen health indicators including a history of heart attack or cancer, and subjective probabilities of survival.  The estimation is based on mortality between waves 1 and 2 of the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest-Old study.  We find that the relationship between socio-economic indicators and mortality declines with age 13 health indicators are strong predictors of mortality and that the subjective survival probabilities predict mortality even after controlling for socio-economic indicators and the health conditions.\n\n",
