Investment and Value: A Neoclassical Benchmark

NBER Working Paper No. 13866

JEL No. E22
ABSTRACT
Which investment model best fits firm-level data? To answer this question we estimate alternative
models using Compustat data. Surprisingly, the two best-performing specifications are based on Hayashi's
(1982) model. This model's foremost implication, that Q is a sufficient statistic for determining a firm's
investment decision, has been often rejected because cash-flow and lagged-investment effects are present
in investment regressions. However, we find that these regression results are quite fragile and ineffectual
for evaluating model performance. So, forget what investment regressions tell you. Models based on
Hayashi (1982) provide a very good description of investment behavior at the firm level.

1. Introduction
Hayashi’s (1982) neoclassical model of investment famously implies that Tobin’s
Q is a su¢ cient statistic for determining a …rm’s investment decision. This implication has been empirically rejected. Both cash-‡ow and lagged-investment e¤ects
have been found in virtually every investment regression speci…cation and data
sample. These results suggest that Hayashi’s model is an inadequate description
of the behavior of investment at the …rm level.
In this paper we search for an empirically successful model of investment.
Instead of using investment regressions as our guide, we estimate three candidate
models. We use the simulated method of moments and focus on means, standard
deviations, persistence, and skewness properties of cash ‡ow, Q, and investment.
Our estimates are based on …rm-level data for the top quartile of Compustat …rms
sorted by the size of the capital stock in the beginning of the sample. These are
the …rms that Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988) (henceforth FHP) use as
their frictionless benchmark because they are unlikely to be a¤ected by …nancial
frictions.
We consider three models driven by stochastic shocks that can be interpreted
as productivity or demand shocks. We assume that these shocks follow a regimeswitching process. This assumption is important, as it generates skewness in cash
‡ows, as well as the low correlation between Q and cash ‡ow that we observe in
the data.
The …rst model, which we call the “generalized Hayashi model,” features decreasing returns to scale in production, a …xed operating cost, and quadratic
capital adjustment costs. The conditions for Q to be a su¢ cient statistic for
investment choice are not satis…ed in this model. However, in a single-regime
version of the model, the decision rule for optimal investment can still be very

1

closely approximated by a log-linear function of Q. The second model, which we
call the “Hayashi model,” is a version of Hayashi’s (1982) model with quadratic
investment adjustment costs. The third model, which we call the “CEE model”
incorporates adjustment costs that penalize changes in the level of investment, as
proposed by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). This speci…cation has
gained currency in the macroeconomics literature because it generates impulse responses to monetary policy shocks that are consistent with those estimated using
vector auto-regressions.
Surprisingly, we …nd that both the Hayashi model and the generalized Hayashi
model …t …rm-level data very well. The CEE model also provides a reasonably
good …t, but it generates excess persistence in investment and insu¢ cient skewness
in investment. These properties result from the fact that the CEE model penalizes
large changes in investment, generating a highly persistent investment series that
exhibits very few investment spikes.
Our results raise an obvious question. If the Hayashi and generalized-Hayashi
models provide a good description of investment behavior at the …rm level, why are
their implications for investment regressions rejected by the data? In the Hayashi
model the investment regression results can stem from measurement error. After
all, the key regressor, Q, is notoriously di¢ cult to measure. In the generalizedHayashi model mispeci…cation can also play a role, since the conditions for Q to
be a su¢ cient statistic for investment choice are not satis…ed.
The cash-‡ow e¤ect present in our data is likely to be caused by measurement
error and/or model mispeci…cation. We draw this inference because we …nd cash‡ow e¤ects in our sample, even though it only contains very large …rms that are
unlikely to face borrowing constraints.1
1

Several authors suggest that cash-‡ow e¤ects can be generated by deviations from Hayashi’s
(1982) assumptions. For example, Schiantarelli and Georgoutsos (1990), Cooper and Ejarque
(2000), Gomes (2001), Alti (2003), and Moyen (2004) study the implications of decreasing re-

2

To investigate the role of measurement error and model mispeci…cation we
run investment regressions on data generated by simulating our three models,
adding empirically plausible measurement error to Q. All three models generate
cash-‡ow and lagged-investment e¤ects. The generalized Hayashi model generates
e¤ects that are remarkably similar to those we estimate in our data. In this model
these e¤ects emerge both from measurement error in Q and from mispeci…cation
in the investment regression, since Q is not a su¢ cient statistic for investment
choice. The optimal level of investment is a function of three state variables: the
capital stock, the shock, and the regime. So any additional independent variable
that is correlated with the state variables has explanatory power in a regression
equation. As a result, cash-‡ow and lagged-investment e¤ects emerge naturally,
even though the model is not designed to produce them.2 These results suggest
that the investment regressions that have received so much empirical attention
are quite fragile and ine¤ectual to discriminate between alternative models.
Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the generalized
Hayashi model. In Section 3 we discuss our data and estimation procedure. Section 4 presents the results for a version of the generalized Hayashi model in which
the demand or productivity shock has a single regime. We also discuss the e¤ects
of introducing asymmetric investment adjustment costs, investment irreversibility,
variable discount factor, as well as a behavioral bias. In Section 5 we discuss results
turns to scale, while Abel and Eberly (2001, 2005) analyze the e¤ects of growth options. Other
results in the literature suggest that Hayashi’s model is misspeci…ed. Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995) construct a measure of Tobin’s Q using a VAR methodology. When they include
cash ‡ow as an explanatory variable for forecasting Tobin’s Q, the power of cash ‡ow to predict large-…rm’s investment declines, disappearing in some subsamples. Similarly, Erickson and
Whited (2000) test for cash-‡ow e¤ects in …rm level data and …nd that, when they go beyond
a classical measurement error speci…cation and instead allow for higher (third) order moments
and heteroskedasticity, evidence of a cash-‡ow e¤ect disappears for both large and small …rms.
2
For this reason our analysis di¤ers from that of Cooper and Ejarque (2003) who estimate the
parameters of an investment model so as to generate the cash-‡ow e¤ects present in Compustat
data.

model. Section 7 contains results for the CEE model. Section 8 concludes.

2. The Generalized Hayashi Model
The …rm’s problem is given by the following Bellman equation, where y 0 denotes
next period’s value of variable y:
V (K; X; z) = max[zK X 1
I

X
Z

[I=K

(

1)]2 K

I

V (K 0 ; X 0 ; z 0 )F (dz 0 ; z)],

K 0 = I + (1

)K.

The variable X denotes the level of exogenous technological progress. This variable
grows at a constant rate

> 1:
X 0 = X.

The function V (K; X; z) represents the value of a …rm with capital stock K,
technical progress, X, and total factor productivity, z. The behavior of z is
governed by the distribution F ( ). We denote the discount factor by
…rm’s output is zK X 1

. The

K. Capital depreciates at rate . The variable

represents a …xed operating cost

paid in every period.
Investment, denoted by I, is subject to quadratic adjustment costs, which
are represented by the term

[I=K

(

1)]2 K. This formulation has the

property that adjustment costs are zero when the …rm grows at its steady state
growth rate, . The parameter controls the size of the adjustment costs.

Since our estimates are based on …rm-level data, this result does not imply that these
features are not useful to understand investment in less aggregated data (e.g. at the plant level
or in smaller …rms).

We de…ne cash-‡ow (CFt ) as:
CFt = zK X 1

(

so we interpret investment adjustment costs as reducing output or revenue.
We consider two versions of the model. In the ‘single-regime model’, z follows
a Markov chain where the mean shock is normalized to one and the support is
given by:
z 2 f1

; 1; 1 + g .

We assume that the Markov chain for the single-regime model takes the form:
3
2
p2
2p(1 p)
(1 p)2
= 4 p(1 p) p2 + (1 p)2 p(1 p) 5 .
(1 p)2
2p(1 p)
p2

The …rst-order serial correlation of the shock implied by this matrix is:

= 2p

(see Rouwenhorst (1995)).

It is useful to rewrite the …rm’s problem in terms of detrended variables, k =

We solve the model using the value-function iteration method (see Appendix
9.3).

3. Estimation
In this section we …rst describe the data used in our estimation and summarize
some key features using simple regressions. We then describe our estimation
procedure.
3.1. Data
To estimate the model we use a balanced panel of Compustat …rms with annual
data for the period 1981-2003. Using a balanced panel introduces a selection
bias towards more stable …rms which are the intended focus of our study. Our
sample includes 776 …rms and roughly 14; 000 …rm-year observations. We focus our
analysis on the large …rms in our data, de…ned as being those in the top quartile
of …rms sorted by size of the capital stock in 1981. In the beginning of the sample,
the top quartile of …rms represents 30 percent of aggregate private non-residential
investment and 40 percent of corporate non-residential investment. We use data
for the four variables present in our model: investment in property, plant, and
equipment, the physical capital stock, Q , and cash ‡ow. We exclude from our
sample …rms that have made a major acquisition to help ensure that investment
measures purchases of new property, plant, and equipment. We estimate the
6

physical capital stock using the perpetual inventory method. We use the book
value of capital as the starting value for the capital stock and four-digit industryspeci…c estimates of the depreciation rate. Q is calculated as the market value of
equity plus the book value of debt, divided by the capital stock estimate. Cash
‡ow is measured using the Compustat item for Income before extraordinary items
+ depreciation and amortization + minor adjustments. We describe the data in
more detail in Appendix 9.1.
In Table 1 we report summary statistics for the fourth quartile (largest) …rms
in our sample, both for the 1981-2003 period and for two sub-periods, 1981-1992
and 1993-2003. Those statistics correspond to the median across …rms of selected
time-series moments. The median values are 1:3 for Q , 0:15 for the investmentcapital ratio, and 0:17 for the cash-‡ow-capital ratio. We report the standard
deviations for both the logarithms and levels of the main variables. Q is the most
volatile variable, closely followed by cash ‡ow/capital and investment/capital.
The estimates in Table 1 are similar to those reported in other studies that use
Compustat data.
There are important di¤erences across sub-samples. In particular, the mean
and standard deviation of Q and cash ‡ow in the second sub-sample are signi…cantly higher than in the earlier period. All variables exhibit positive skewness,
and there is more skewness in the full sample than in each of the two sub-samples.
The systematic di¤erences across sub-samples lead us to consider a regime switching model in our estimation strategy. We return to this point when we discuss
estimation and the regime-switching model. Finally, Q exhibits strong serial correlation, while investment and cash ‡ow exhibit moderate persistence.
In Table 2 we report pooled, time-series-cross-section regressions of the investmentcapital ratio on Q, cash ‡ow/capital and lagged investment/capital. The coe¢ cient on Q is quantitatively small (0:06), but signi…cant, with modest explanatory
7

power (R2 = 0:29). Including cash ‡ow increases signi…cantly the explanatory
power of the regression (R2 = 0:34) and reduces the size (0:03) and signi…cance of
the coe¢ cient on Q. Cash ‡ow has a large and statistically signi…cant e¤ect on the
investment-capital ratio. As discussed in the introduction, this cash-‡ow e¤ect is
surprising since we use data for the top quartile of Compustat …rms, which a priori
are unlikely to face borrowing constraints. We view this e¤ect as stemming from
measurement error and or mispeci…cation. We explore these possibilities in sections 4 and 5. Adding the lagged investment-capital ratio to the regression leads
to a large improvement in the goodness of …t (R2 = 0:61). Even though much
of the investment literature focuses on the cash-‡ow e¤ect, the lagged-investment
e¤ect is more important.
Figures 1 through 3 provide scatter plots that are useful to visualize the relation
between di¤erent variables. Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of investment versus
log(Q). Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of investment and cash ‡ow. Figure 3 shows
the close correlation between the investment-capital ratio and its lagged value.
3.2. Estimation Procedure
Our solution method does not yield an analytical representation for the population
moments implied by the model. For this reason, we estimate the model using the
simulated method of moments proposed by Lee and Ingram (1991). We …rst use
our data to estimate the vector of moments

as described in Section 3.1. The
objective is then to …nd the parameter vector ^ which minimizes the distance
between the empirical and simulated moments, ( ^ ).

The weighting matrix W is computed using a block-bootstrap method on our

4. Results: Generalized Hayashi Model, Single Regime
We choose the exogenous rate of technical progress to be

= 1:03. This growth

rate is chosen to match the real annual growth rate of corporate net cash ‡ows
from January 1981 to January 2004. We also …x the degree of returns to scale to
= 0:8. This value is the estimate of the average degree of returns to scale across
industries by Burnside (1996). We …x
and

because we cannot separately identify

using the moments of the data that we consider. Both parameters control

curvature, so when

changes the value of

can be adjusted to restore the …t of

the model.
4.1. Parameter and moment estimates
We report our parameter estimates and standard errors in Table 3. Our estimate
of the adjustment cost parameter, , is 0:4148 (with a standard error of 0:0035).
This estimate implies that the average investment adjustment cost is 1:2 percent of
sales. Our estimate for the …xed operating cost, , is 87:07 (with a standard error
of 2:23). This estimate implies annual …xed operating costs that are 18 percent
9

of annual sales. We normalize the average shock z to be 1, and the spread is plus
or minus 0:522. As we discuss below, these values allow the model to match the
mean and standard deviation of the cash-‡ow to capital ratio in the data.
Table 1 reports summary statistics for a panel of …rms constructed by simulating our model. The moments in bold are included in the

D

vector, so our

estimation algorithm seeks to make these moments as close as possible to those
estimated from Compustat data. The algorithm matches all of these moments
closely. The remaining moments are not “targeted”by the algorithm.
Table 1 shows that the single-regime model matches well the …rst-order serial
correlations of sales, cash ‡ow, and investment, although Q is signi…cantly less
persistent than in the data. The model generates a much lower standard deviation
and skewness of Q than is found in the data. We add measurement error to our
estimate of Q to match both the standard deviation and persistence of Q from
Compustat. Adding measurement error raises the skewness of Q to a level that
is higher than that found in the data. We generate Qnoise = Q exp("t ); where
"t+1 = 0:9"t + 0:17

t+1

and

t

v N (0; 1). Since the measurement error is serially

correlated, it cannot be corrected in the investment regressions using instrumental
variables.
4.2. Simulated regression results
To evaluate the performance of our model from a di¤erent angle we estimate
investment regressions on a panel of …rms constructed by simulating our model.
We use as explanatory variables both the state variables, which are only observable
in the model, as well as Q, cash ‡ow, and lagged investment. We report our results
in Table 2. The …rst column shows that regression investment on the true state
variables of the model (k and the shock, z) using a semi-log speci…cation yields
an R2 of 0:95. This speci…cation proves a very good description of how optimal
10

investment depends on the state variables. We also obtain a very good …t when
we regress investment on log(Q). Therefore, when Q is measured perfectly, it
provides a very good proxy for the two state variables. In this sense, this model
is not much di¤erent from the original Hayashi (1982) model.
Since empirical measures of Q incorporate substantial measurement error, we
create a noisy version of Q that is consistent with the properties of Q in the data.
When we use this noisy version of Q in our investment regressions the R2 falls to
0:08 and the coe¢ cient on Q is 0:037 (compared to 0:466 for the true Q ). When
cash ‡ow is added to the regression with noisy Q, the coe¢ cient on Q falls below
0:01, cash ‡ow has a coe¢ cient of 0:08, and the R2 rises to 0:71. The …nal column
reports the results of replacing cash ‡ow with z in the investment regression. This
substitution yields a coe¢ cient estimate and R2 that are nearly identical to using
cash ‡ow as a dependent variable. Since there are no frictions in the model, cash
‡ow enters signi…cantly in the regression because it is a proxy for z.
One shortcoming of the single-regime model is that it cannot explain the role of
lagged investment in investment regressions. When we include lagged investment
in the model-based regressions we obtain a very small coe¢ cient (0:02, compared
to 0:63 in the data) and a very small increase in explanatory power.
In summary, the generalized Hayashi model can generate a cash-‡ow e¤ect
because when Q is measured with error, cash ‡ow is a proxy for z. We also
…nd that the model is inconsistent with the importance of lagged investment in
investment regressions and with the skewness properties of Q, cash ‡ow, and
investment. In the next section we show that the performance of the model can
be greatly improved by adding a regime-switching component to the Markov chain
for z.

11

4.3. Other model speci…cations
We explored several alternative model speci…cations to identify the features that
are important to replicate the key moments of our data. We considered di¤erent
speci…cations of the adjustment cost function, a time-varying discount factor, as
well as a behavioral bias.
The skewness in investment led us to consider asymmetric adjustment costs,
both in the form of asymmetric quadratic adjustment costs and an irreversibility
constraint. The asymmetric adjustment costs that we considered takes the form:
(I=K
2 (I=K
1

When

1

>

2,

)2 K
)2 K

if I=K > ;
if I=K < .

this formulation can match the skewness in investment. It does

not however generate enough skewness and volatility in Q, and cannot explain the
presence of signi…cant lagged-investment e¤ects in empirical regressions.
We studied a version of the model that incorporates irreversibility in investment. This constraint is irrelevant because it never binds both in our data and
in our model, simulated using the estimated parameter values. This result is not
surprising. Other authors, such as Doms and Dunne (1998) show that aggregating
data for smaller …rms or for individual plants tends to smooth out non-convexities
in investment.
We found that introducing empirically plausible variability in the discount
factor had almost no impact on the implications of our model for the moments of
interest. For this reason, we computed our main results using a constant discount
rate.
Finally, we introduced a behavioral bias into the model. Speci…cally, we assumed that managers forecast fundamentals using the correct Markov chain but
investors forecast future shocks using a distorted Markov chain with higher persistence (larger diagonal values). This speci…cation generated enough volatility
12

in Q, but failed to replicate the skewness of Q found in the data. Finally, we
re-estimated the model using a more ‡exible speci…cation for the shock distribution that allows for a skewed support. This model can match the skewness of
investment in the data, but it requires skewness in cash ‡ow that is four times
greater than in the data.

5. Results: Generalized Hayashi Model with Regime Switching
The regime-switching speci…cation allows for a second regime in the productivity
shock z. The average shock is normalized to one. We separately estimate spreads
across regimes ( , see equation (2.1)) and within regimes (

L

and

H

). We also

estimate the discount factor, the persistence of the shocks, as well as the switching
parameters in the Markov chain.
5.1. Parameter and moment estimates
We report the estimated model parameters and standard errors in Table 3. Our
estimate for the adjustment cost parameter, , is 0:9028 (with a standard error of
0:022), which implies that the average investment adjustment cost is 1:2 percent
of sales. The estimated …xed operating cost, , is 87:81 (with a standard error
of 1:74), which is similar to the value found for the single-regime model. This
implies that annual …xed operating costs are 18 percent of annual sales.
Figure 4 plots the shocks in the two regimes. The high regime has a higher
average productivity, but also a higher standard deviation. It is interesting to note
that the support of the two regimes overlap. In fact, the low shock in the high
regime is lower than the high shock in the low regime. All of these parameters are
precisely estimated. The estimated Markov chain described in Table 4 exhibits
strong persistence: the parameter

is 0:5289. We also estimate the probabilities
13

of switching regime from either the middle state or from the state closest to the
alternative regime (e.g., transiting from the highest low state to the high regime, or
from the lowest high state to the low regime). These probabilities are 3:63 percent
and 17:59 percent, respectively. These estimates imply that the (unconditional)
probability of a regime switch is approximately 7 percent per year.
Table 1 reports summary statistics for the panel of …rms simulated using the
regime-switching model. The highlighted moments are included in the

D

vector.

The algorithm matches all of these moments quite closely. These results indicate
that incorporating regime switching improves the …t of the model, particularly
for the higher moments of the data. Compared to the single-regime model, the
standard deviation of Q is substantially higher, and the model generates skewness
in Q and investment that are much closer to the data. The serial correlation
properties are also better than those of the single regime model. Before running
investment regressions, we again match the standard deviation of Q in the data by
adding measurement error. We choose the serial correlation of the measurement
error to preserve the serial correlation in Q.4
In order to better understand the dynamics of the model, we calculate the
elasticity of each moment in the

D

vector with respect to the parameters of the

model. This exercise shows how changes in parameter values a¤ect the model’s
performance. We report this elasticity matrix in Table 5. In the …rst row of the
table we see that average Q in the …rst (low) regime is heavily in‡uenced by the
…xed operating cost, , as well as by the discount factor .
Since we keep the average shock, z, constant in the model, the average cash ‡ow
for each of the two regimes is largely determined by the spread

each regime has a unit elasticity with respect to the standard deviation of shocks
in the regime. The standard deviation of the investment-capital ratio is largely
determined by the adjustment cost parameter . The spread parameter

is also

an important determinant as it a¤ects the volatility of investment across regimes.
Finally, the skewness of investment is heavily in‡uenced by the serial correlation
of the shock.

5.2. Simulated regression results
We now regress investment on its determinants using simulated data. We use as
explanatory variables both the state variables, which are only observable in the
model, as well as Q, cash ‡ow, and lagged investment. We report our results in Table 2. In the …rst column, we use the model’s state variables to explain investment
using a semi-log speci…cation. As in the single regime model, this speci…cation
provides a good approximation to the policy function for the investment-capital
ratio, with a R2 of 0:97. A regression of investment on Q has a R2 of only 0:56
(compared to 0:95 for the single-regime model), and the Q coe¢ cient is equal
to 0:1278. If we use a noisy measure of Q that matches the empirical standard
deviation of Q, the coe¢ cient on Q falls to 0:0582 and the R2 drops sharply to
0:25. When we control for the regime the R2 rises to from 0:25 to 0:39 while
15

the coe¢ cient on Q falls from 0:0582 to 0:0281. The importance of adding measurement error in Q falls signi…cantly in the regime switching model because the
regime-switching disrupts the relation between investment and the shocks.
If we follow the empirical literature and add cash ‡ow to this regression, the
coe¢ cient on Q falls to 0:0478. Cash ‡ow enters signi…cantly with a coe¢ cient of
0:0245 and the R2 rises from 0:25 to 0:29. As in the single regime model, we obtain
similar results when we replace cash ‡ow with z. Cash ‡ow enters signi…cantly in
the investment regression because it is a proxy for z.
The estimates we obtain for a regression of investment on Q are nearly identical
to those obtained by running the same regression with Compustat data. The
coe¢ cient on Q is 0:0582 (versus 0:060 in the data), and the R2 is 0:25 (0:29
in the data). The results are also comparable when we add cash ‡ow to the
regression: there is a modest rise in the R2 and a reduction in the coe¢ cient on
Q.
Finally, including lagged investment in the regression improves the …t considerably in both model and data regressions, lowering the coe¢ cients on Q and
cash ‡ow. The parameter estimates are very similar in model and data regressions. Recall that this similarity is not present in the investment regressions for
the single-regime model. In those regressions lagged investment is driven out by
cash ‡ow (see Table 2).
The presence of regime switching improves the ability of the model to …t the
moments of the data. It also helps the model match the empirical covariation
and partial covariation among investment, cash ‡ow, and Q. These results suggest that the presence of regime switching is crucial to understanding investment
regressions. In the data and in the simulation, both the true Q and noisy Q have
relatively poor explanatory power for investment when there is regime switching
(Table 2). Cash ‡ow improves the …t of the regression, but not nearly as dramati16

cally as it did in the single regime model, where using cash ‡ow to proxy the shock
raised the R2 from 0:08 to 0:71. In the regime switching model, the addition of
cash ‡ow only increases the R2 from 0:25 to 0:29. Figure 6 illustrates this property. It plots the investment rate, i=k, as a function of the capital stock for each
value of the shock, z, in the regime switching model. The relation between the
current shock and current investment is non-monotonic. The lowest investment
rates occur on the lowest branch of the graph, when the shock is in the low regime
and z = 0:5957. Investment rates are substantially higher when the shock is in
the high regime and z takes on its lowest value: z = 0:5701. This property results
from the fact that the probability of transiting between regimes is low. Within the
high regime, even when current z is very low, future prospects are bright because
there is a high probability of transiting to a high value of z. In the low regime,
even when current z is high, the prospects for the future are relatively bleak and
thus investment remains low. The transition dynamics within and across regimes
break the monotonic relationship between both investment and z and investment
and cash ‡ow.
A similar argument explains why the regime-switching model can replicate
the lagged-investment e¤ect present in the data. Since regime changes do not
occur often, last period’s level of investment is a good indicator of the current
regime. In other words, lagged investment acts as a proxy for an aspect of the
shock process (the regime) that is not embodied by cash ‡ow. In contrast, in the
single-regime model, the close relation between the shock and cash ‡ow makes
lagged investment redundant in explaining current investment.

6. Hayashi’s Model
In this section we study a version of Hayashi’s model by considering a special case
of the generalized Hayashi model in which returns to scale are constant ( = 1)
17

and the …xed cost of operating is zero ( = 0).
The …rm’s problem is given by the following Bellman equation:
V (K; z) = max
[zK
0
i;k

(I=K
)2 K I
Z
+
V (K 0 ; z 0 )F (dz 0 ; z)],

(6.1)

subject to:
K 0 = I + (1

(6.2)

)K.

We consider a regime-switching process and choose the Markov chain and the
support of z so that the model matches the empirical volatility of the cash-‡owto-capital ratio. The support of z is given by:5

We solve the model taking advantage of the fact that the value function is homogeneous of degree one (see 9.4 for details).
One interesting …nding is that if we set

= , this model fails to match even

the most basic moments of the data, such as the average value of Q and the
volatility of I=K. The fact that the model generates in…nite values for V and Q
for many parameter combinations is at the heart of this failure. When the discount
factor is high (i.e. the real interest rate is low) the average values of V and Q
are often in…nity. The value of the …rm is …nite only when the adjustment cost
parameter, , is very high. However, high adjustment costs imply low investment
volatility. When the discount factor is low (i.e. the real interest rate is high) it
is possible to generate a …nite …rm value with low values of . However, the low
discount factor produces very low values for Q.
5

The performance of this regime-switching version of Hayashi’s model is much better than
that of a single-regime version. To conserve space we do not report results for the single-regime
version.

18

We now report results for a version of the model in which we estimate . Table
3 reports the parameter estimates and standard errors for the Hayashi model with
regime switching. Table 1 compares the implied data moments from the model
to those in the data. The model matches closely the data moments, including the
average level of Q in both regimes, and the overall volatility and skewness of Q.
Since investment closely tracks Q in this model, overall investment volatility and
skewness also match the data. However, the adjustment cost required to match the
data reduces investment volatility within regimes (for example, the volatility of
investment is 0:016 in the low regime, compared to 0:05 in the data) and requires
a large change in investment across regimes (from 0:112 to 0:210 from the low to
high regimes) versus almost no change across regimes in the data. Overall, the
…t is comparable to that of the generalized Hayashi model. In some dimensions
the …t is superior (e.g., the dynamics of Q) in the Hayashi model, while in others
(e.g., investment dynamics) the generalized Hayashi model is a better …t.
6.1. Simulated regression results
Table 2 reports the results of estimating investment regressions on data simulated
from the Hayashi model. The …rst regressions con…rm that Q is a su¢ cient statistic for investment. The R2 of the regression of investment on (log) Q is 0.98.
Even with regime switching, neither lagged investment nor cash ‡ow are signi…cant
once Q is included in the investment regression. These results are not surprising
given that the conditions under which Q is a su¢ cient statistic for investment are
satis…ed.
The second set of regressions use a version of the model where Q is measured
with error. As with our previous model, this measurement error process is chosen
so that the resulting Q matches the empirical standard deviation and persistence

19

of Q.6 In this version of the model Q is no longer a su¢ cient statistic for the choice
of investment, and cash-‡ow and lagged-investment e¤ects emerge. However, these
e¤ects are much weaker than in the data. Regressing investment on noisy Q alone
generates an R2 of 0.78; adding only cash ‡ow reduces the coe¢ cient on Q from
0.12 to 0.11 with a coe¢ cient on cash ‡ow of 0.02. Adding lagged investment
raises the R2 further to 0.87, but the coe¢ cient on lagged investment is only 0.44
compared to 0.62 in the data. In this speci…cation the coe¢ cient on Q is …ve
times as large as it is in the data.

7. CEE Model
Many recent macroeconomic models incorporate a form of adjustment costs proposed by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). In this formulation, adjustment costs depend on changes in the level of investment, so lagged investment
e¤ects are likely to arise naturally in investment regressions. In this section we
study the properties of a version of our model that incorporates CEE-style adjustment costs.
The …rm’s problem, written in terms of detrended variables, is given by:
Z
v(k; i 1 ; z) = max
zk

V (k 0 ; i; z 0 )F (dz 0 ; z) ,

denotes the value of investment in the previous period. The presence of a

third state variable in the value function requires us to adopt a di¤erent algorithm
to solve the model. We describe this algorithm in the appendix.
6

We generate Qnoise = Q exp("t ); where "t+1 = 0:75"t + 0:125

20

t+1

and

t

v N (0; 1).

We estimate that the adjustment cost parameter,

, is equal to 0:88, with a

standard error of 0:022.7 The other parameter estimates, shown in Table 3, are
close to those for the generalized Hayashi model.
Table 1 shows that the …t of the CEE adjustment costs is generally very good.
This …t is comparable to that of the generalized Hayashi model with three exceptions. First, the CEE formulation generates too much investment persistence.
The …rst-order serial correlation of investment is 0:94 in the model and 0:60 in
the data. The high degree of investment persistence generated by the model is
not surprising since this speci…cation penalizes changes in the level of investment.
Second, the model yields too much volatility in investment (0:063 versus 0:055).
Third, the model does not generate enough skewness in investment (0:21 versus
0:42). This property is a direct consequence of the adjustment cost speci…cation:
an increase in

reduces both the standard deviation and skewness of investment,

and the estimation procedure cannot …nd a set of parameter values which …ts both
moments.
Table 2 reports the results of estimating investment regressions on data simulated from the model with CEE adjustment costs. This model generates a regression coe¢ cient on Q that is very similar to the data. The cash-‡ow e¤ect is weak
and sometimes negative. The model generates a lagged investment e¤ect that is
stronger than that found in the data. This property re‡ects the fact that lagged
investment is a state variable in this model.
7

The value of
estimated by CEE using macro data and a model with a constant returns
to scale in production is 1:24. CEE estimate 00 (1) = 2:48, where 00 (1) is the second derivative
of the adjusment cost function evaluated at the steady state. In our case the adjustment cost
function is quadractic, so
= 00 (1)=2.

21

8. Conclusions
We estimate three models of investment and examine their implications for the
mean, standard deviation, skewness and persistence of investment, cash ‡ow, and
Q. While all three models can closely match the key data moments, the generalized
Hayashi model and the Hayashi model both replicate the salient empirical features
of investment, cash ‡ow and value in our sample of large …rms. These models
would nonetheless be rejected by tests based on investment regressions. We …nd
empirically plausible cash ‡ow and lagged investment e¤ects in data simulated
from these models when we add plausible measurement error to Q. This result
illustrates the importance of going beyond investment regressions when assessing
investment models. The Hayashi-based models that we estimate replicate key
features of …rm-level investment, cash ‡ow, and value. This property makes these
models a natural point of departure for a quantitative study of classic issues in
corporate …nance, such as the choice of capital structure.

9.3. Solution Method, Generalized Hayashi Model
We assume that k can only take nk discrete values. We start with a guess for
the value function, V 0 (k; z) for each pair (k; z). We compute the policy function
0

k = h0 (k; z) by …nding the value of k 0 that maximizes the value of the …rm for each
pair (k; z). The new value function, V 1 (k; z) is given by the following equation
with m = 1:

We use V 1 (k; z) to …nd a new policy function k = h1 (k; z) and a new value
function, V 2 (k; z). We continue to iterate until V m 1 (k; z) and V m (k; z) converge
for every (k; z) pair.
In practice, this method is slow to converge. To speed up the procedure in
the context of our SMM estimation, which requires solving the model at every
iteration, we instead adopt a hybrid method. We start with a policy function
iteration approach: we iterate as above until hm 1 (k; z) and hm (k; z) converge
for every (k; z) pair. Once this is done, we iterate on the value function, keeping
the policy function constant, until convergence. Not having to …nd a new policy
function at that stage makes this hybrid procedure signi…cantly faster.

9.4. Solution Method, Hayashi Model
The value function, V (K; z), is homogeneous of degree one in the capital stock.
This property follows from the fact that we can write the value function as a
sum of functions that are homogeneous of degree one. The homogeneity property
allows us to rewrite (6.1) as:
V (1; z) = max[z

We solve the model using value-function iteration. We start with a guess for the

9.5. Solution Method, CEE Model
We obtain numerical solutions to the model with CEE adjustment costs using the
following algorithm developed in Lkhagvasuren (2006):
1. De…ne a coarse grid for (k; i 1 ; z);
2. Choose a guess for v(k; i 1 ; z) and evaluate it on the coarse grid;
3. Choose a …ne grid for i 1 ;
4. Generate a …ne grid for k compatible with …ne grid for i

1

using the resource

constraint, (7.1);
5. Use bilinear interpolation to evaluate v(k; i 1 ; z) for every value of z on the
…ne grid for i

1

and z;8

6. Find the optimal value of i for every (k; i 1 ; z) combination;
7. Save the new value of v(k; i 1 ; z) evaluated on the coarse grid;
8. Save the policy function for i, i(k; i 1 ; z), evaluated on the …ne grid;
9. Check whether the value function has converged;
10. If the value function has converged then stop; else go to step 5;
To simulate the model we can use a bilinear interpolation of i(k; i 1 ; z) evaluated for every z, for every pair (k; i 1 ) evaluated on the …ne grid. This interpolation procedure avoids k and i

1

having to take values on the real line.

Bilinear interpolation is an extension of linear interpolation for bivariate functions. Suppose
we know the values of the function f (x; y) evaluated at four points: (x1 ; y1 ), (x2 ; y1 ), (x1 ; y2 ),
1 ;y1 )
2 ;y1 )
and (x2 ; y2 ). Then f (x; y) ' (x2 fx(x1 )(y

9.6. Estimation Method
The objective of the simulated method of moments is to …nd the parameter vector
^ that minimizes the distance between empirical ( D ) and simulated moments
( ( )):
L( ^ ) = min [ ( )

D]

0

W[ ( )

D] .

(9.4)

The weighting matrix, W , is obtained using the variance-covariance matrix of the
empirical moments,

D:

W =

1
,
D (1 + 1=k)

(9.5)

where k = length of simulation=length of sample. We estimate the matrix

D

using a block-bootstrap method as follows: We form m samples. Each sample
consists of data for n …rms drawn with replacement from our data set. For each
of the m samples we compute the vector of empirical moments. We use the m
observations on the vector of moments to estimate the variance-covariance matrix
of the empirical moments,

D.

We solve the minimization problem (9.4) using an annealing algorithm. The
…rst step consists in choosing initial values for the parameter vector, , admissible
ranges for the parameters, as well as the “temperature” and the step size. As
we discuss below, the temperature controls the probability that, given the best
parameter vector so far,
(L( 0 ) > L(

, we accept a parameter vector

0

that yields a worse …t

)). This procedure is used to avoid convergence to a local minimum.

We start with a high temperature value, so that the algorithm explores di¤erent
regions of the parameter space.
The second step is to generate a new parameter vector,
shocks to the elements of

0

, by adding random

within their admissible range. Next we solve the

model using value-function iteration for the parameter vector

0

and simulate

1940 representative …rms (each with 23 years of data). Since the number of …rms
33

in our Compustat sample is equal to 194, this implies that k in (9.5) equals
10. The fourth step consists in computing the simulated moments and L( 0 ).
If L( 0 ) < L(

) we set

probability exp [ (L( 0 )

=
L(

0

. If L( 0 ) > L(

) we set

=

0

with

)) =temperature]. Finally, we reduce the values of

temperature and step size before going back to step two. The vector of parameter
estimates is the one that generates the lowest value of L. We denote this vector
by ^ .
To verify the convergence properties of our estimation procedure, we used a
simple robustness check. Starting with a parameter vector ~ , we simulate a panel
of …rms and compute the simulated moments,

( ~ ). We then use the SMM pro-

cedure described above to …t these moments. Ideally, we would like the parameter
estimates ^ to be as close as possible to the true parameter values ~ (the ones
that generated the data). Failure to do so may indicate that the estimation procedure is not adequate or that the model parameters are not identi…ed. We …nd
that our procedure can recover reasonably well the true parameter values. This
is also con…rmed by the fact that we obtain similar parameter estimates across
SMM runs with di¤erent starting values.

*For each variable, we compute the time series average for each firm in the sample, and report the median across firms.
“Q” is Tobin’s Q, I is investment in property, plant, and equipment, and K is the capital stock.
Construction of the variables is described in the text and in the data appendix.
