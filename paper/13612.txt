Goods Trade and International Equity Portfolios

NBER Working Paper No. 13612
November 2007
JEL No. F21,F3
ABSTRACT
We show that international trade in goods is the main determinant of international equity portfolios
and offers a compelling -- theoretically and empirically -- resolution of the portfolio home bias puzzle.
The model implies that investors can achieve full international risk diversification if the share of wealth
invested in foreign equity matches their country's degree of openness (the imports to GDP share). The
empirical evidence strongly supports this implication.

Introduction
In a typical country, consumers tend to consume mostly goods that are produced domestically.
This phenomenon has been termed home bias in consumption. Similarly, investors tend to invest
most of their wealth in domestic assets, and most of the capital in any country is owned by the
domestic residents. This phenomenon has been termed portfolio home bias. Are these two biases
linked1 ?
Stockman and Dellas, 1988, (henceforth, SD) argue that this is indeed the case2 : the presence of
consumption home bias –due to the existence of non–traded goods– can induce a similar bias in
portfolio holdings. In SD’s endowment economy with a separable utility function between traded
and non–traded goods, the optimal portfolio of a domestic investor involves full ownership of the
firms that produce the domestic non–traded goods and a fully diversified ownership of the firms
that produce the tradable goods. If the share of non–traded goods in consumption is large, the
model can generate substantial portfolio home bias.
The existing literature has not viewed the SD model as offering a full resolution to the puzzle3 .
The conventional wisdom at the time put the share of non–traded goods in the consumption
basket in the US at around 50%. With this share, the SD model implies that 75% of domestic
wealth will be invested in domestic assets. But this figure falls significantly short of the actual
degree of portfolio home bias observed in the US4 . Recent work by Burstein et al., 2005, however,
suggests that the true CPI share of non traded goods is much higher (close to 80%). With this
1
Naturally, there is also a large literature that attempts to explain portfolio home bias without making use
of consumption home bias (see, for instance, the survey paper by Lewis, 1996). However, it has been met with
limited success so far.
2
See also Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2000, who suggest that these two biases may not only have a common source
but they may also be connected to a number of other biases –puzzles– in international finance. Coeurdacier,
2006, disputes this and claims that introducing trade costs in goods market alone, as suggested by Obstfeld and
Rogoff, is not sufficient to explain these two biases simultaneously. This finding obtains under a very special form
of trade costs and it is not valid in general. SD and especially the present paper paper establish that trade costs
(as manifested in the existence of non-traded goods) can account for both biases quite well.
3
There exists a large literature that examines whether the portfolio home bias that emanates from non–traded
goods can be augmented with bias arising from traded goods when the SD assumption of separability between
traded and non–traded goods is lifted (Tesar, 1993, Baxter, Jermann, and King, 1998, Serrat, 2001, Pesenti and
Van Wincoop, 2002). In the models of Tesar and Pesenti–Van Wincoop there may be home bias in the shares of
the tradeable sector depending on the value of the preferences and covariance parameters. Unfortunately, these
papers rely on partial equilibrium analysis and thus their results may not hold in general equilibrium. Baxter,
Jermann, and King, 1998, on the other hand, use a general equilibrium, two-period exchange economy. They
argue that the model cannot generates a home bias in the traded goods portfolio. And that equity holdings in
the non–traded goods may well be home biased yet not sufficiently so in order to make the total portfolio exhibit
home bias. But this result owes to the perfect substitutability between traded goods as well as the the absence
of a demand for dynamic hedging. Serrat, 2001, uses a dynamic, general equilibrium model and finds that the
domestic investors fully own the equity of the firms that produce the domestic non–traded good and that there is
also home bias in the equity positions in traded goods. Kollmann, 2006a, has disputed the latter claim, arguing
that the correct solution to the model of Serrat does not involve any portfolio home bias in traded goods equity.
Obstfeld, 2007, provides a thorough review of these as well as other related issues in his Ohlin lectures.

figure, the SD model implies that the share of domestic wealth invested in domestic equity is
around 90%, a number very close to its real world counterpart.
The evidence thus offers support to the SD model. But this test relies heavily on our ability to
separate goods into the traded and non–traded categories, a rather controversial enterprize. An
alternative empirical strategy (e.g., Heathcote and Perri, 2007) for taking international portfolio
models to the data is to work with the degree of openness5 . The SD model has a sharp implication
on this front: it implies that investors can achieve full international risk diversification if the
share of wealth invested in foreign equity is equal to the share of imports in GDP.
Table 1 reports these two shares for the G5 (US, Japan, UK, Germany and France). The
first column of the table gives the share of foreign portfolio equity holdings in total domestic
—equity— portfolio over the period 1995–2004. The second column reports the imports to
GDP share over the same period. The match between the figures in these two columns is very
high. The correlation coefficient is 0.92. The fact that a similarly good match is obtained
when considering other sub–periods or even individual years or when looking at a larger set of
countries (see section 3.1) suggests that this stylized fact is quite robust.
Nonetheless, as we elaborate below, the empirical strategy of casting a model’s implications
in terms of the import share also faces challenges: the model abstracts from some important,
relevant elements present in the real world. In our model, trade flows and value added coincide.
But this is not so in the data. Namely, the standard imports to GDP ratio overstates the
degree of openness because it does not correct for re-exports (the foreign value added contained
in domestic exports). On the asset side, the measure used in Figure 1 ignores housing in the
calculation of domestic equity wealth (thus, it overstates the share of wealth invested in foreign
assets). And it does not include the indirect holdings of foreign assets that arise from holding
stocks in domestic multinationals (thus, it understates the share of wealth invested in foreign
assets). In section 3, we make the appropriate corrections of the trade and the asset data of
the US (unfortunately, there exists no data that would allow such correction in other countries’
data). The close match between the degree of openness and the foreign asset share of domestic
wealth remains (11.7% and 10% respectively).
Having established that the SD model offers a compelling explanation of the home portfolio
puzzle, we examine the effects of two popular refinements. In particular, we examine how deviations from non-separability and symmetry in traded goods consumption affect the properties
of the model. This exercise is important for two reasons. First, it may suggest ways for further
improving the performance of the model. And second and more importantly, it can provide
5

Of course, there exists a correspondence between these two categories in the model. In SD, a share of 11%
for imports (the average US figure during the last twenty five years) translates into a 78% share for non traded
goods in the CPI. This is very similar to the figure reported by Burstein et al., 2005.

an important robustness check. Typically, the theoretical implications reported in the portfolio
literature tend to be very sensitive to even small variation in the key parameters of the model
(see Obstfeld, 2007). We find that our model does not suffer from this weakness. Namely,
departures from separability as well as plausible variation in the main parameters of the model
do not affect materially the properties of optimal portfolios. An additional finding of interest is
that the model can also deliver home bias in the equities of the traded goods industries if the
consumption of traded goods has a foreign bias6 . There exists no empirical evidence on the presence or absence of home bias in traded goods equity and hence it is not known whether portfolio
bias in traded goods represents a desirable feature or not. If it were, our model indicates how it
could be obtained.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section1 contains a description of the model as
well as the solution for country portfolios. The solution method is quite simple and is closely
related to that of Kollmann, 2006b. Section 2 presents the parametrization of the model. Section

Section 5 concludes. A technical appendix provides a formal description of the properties of
portfolios.

The Model

The world consists of two countries, indexed by i = 1, 2. In each period, each country receives
an exogenous endowment of a traded, Yit > 0 and a non–traded Zit > 0, good. The goods are
perishable. We use Yt = {Yit , Zit ; i = 1, 2} to denote the vector of endowments.

A foreign bias in the consumption of traded goods is a standard implication of trade theory. It is also a likely
feature of the CPI; see the discussion in section 3

four independent sources of uncertainty. This implies that the equity markets in this model can
support the complete asset markets allocation of resources up to a linear approximation7 . As in
Kollmann, 2006b, we will use this equivalence to determine asset holdings.
The household’s consumption/portfolio choices are determined by maximizing (1) subject to
(2)–(4). The domestic traded good will be used as the numéraire good. Then the evolution of
asset prices is given by the standard Euler equations

Solving for asset holdings

Asset holdings are indeterminate in the deterministic steady state around which the system is
log-linearized and solved. This creates a difficulty. Our solution method is a variation of that
of Kollmann, 2006b (which in turn is related to Baxter et al., 1998).
Let us focus on the domestic economy (i = 1). We define wealth, in utility terms, as

constant shares.11 . In the technical appendix we report how to check whether the four stocks
effectively complete the markets in our model.

Parametrization

Our baseline parametrization corresponds to the model of SD. It is reported in Table 2. Setting
σρ = 1 implies that the marginal utility of traded good is not affected by variation in the
consumption of the non–traded good (and vice versa). The value of ρ used by Stockman and
Tesar, 1995, is ρ = 0.44. Hence, a natural choice in this case is to set σ = 2 and ρ = 0.5. As in SD,
we set α1 = α2 = 0.5 so there is no bias in the consumption of traded goods. The average degree
of openness (import share) in the US over 1970–2005 is 10.5%. This implies a value for the share
of traded goods in the CPI,12 ω = 0.21 (the imports share is ω(1−α) = 0.21×0.50 = 0.105). This
share is virtually identical to that reported by Burstein et al. 2005. It is considerably smaller
than that used in the earlier literature because it takes into account the non–traded services
and goods associated with the distribution of traded goods (distribution costs associated with
wholesale and retail services, marketing and advertising, and local transportation services). It is
computed as follows: In the US, the share of traded goods in the CPI, computed the traditional
way, is 0.429. Burstein et al, calculate that approximately 50% of that involves non–traded
distribution costs. Hence, the true share of traded goods in CPI is only about 0.21 (50% of
10

We have checked that it does not make any difference for the results which of the three projections are used
or which wealth shares we solve for first. The remaining equation is always satisfied. See the appendix.
11
This first order approximation with time invariant shares will prove useful for an intuitive exposition of
our results. Nevertheless, we have also computed a second order approximation to equation (15). In this case,
there is time variation in share holdings, but the average values are virtually identical to the ones from the first
order approximation. The interested reader is referred to a companion technical appendix to this paper. The
results strongly indicate that low order approximations have very good accuracy properties when computing asset
holdings.
12
Note that this result assumes that the relative price of the non–traded good is equal to one in steady state.
This is ensured by selecting the ratio of the averages of the endowments as z/y = (1 − ω)/ω.

0.429) of which half approximately comes from imported goods and the other half comes from
what Burstein et al. call local goods13 .
The elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign traded goods is set to 1.5 as in Backus
et al., 1995. The discount factor is set to 0.99. The endowment processes are assumed to be
identical. In fact, the form of the processes does not matter for the results.14 More precisely,
neither persistence nor volatilities are of any consequences for the determination of wealth and
equity shares. Naturally, the average level of the process does matter. In the benchmark, traded
and non–traded endowments are such that the relative price of non–traded good is equal to
unity.
We also report results with an alternative parametrization that involves a bias in the consumption of traded goods. Traded goods consumption –home– bias has been used in the literature
as a shortcut for the non-traded goods specification. As mentioned above, Burstein et al., 2005,
assign half of the traded goods in the CPI to imports (10.5% in the US case) and the other half
to local (exportable) goods. But it seems reasonable to assume that some of these local goods
may actually be non–tradeables15 . Let us —arbitrarily— assume that about one–fourth of this
10.5% of local goods is indeed non–traded (say, 2.5%) rather than exportables. This implies that
the true share of domestic exportables in the domestic consumption basket is only 8% rather
that the 10.5% we used earlier (10.5% − 2.5%), and consequently, there exists foreign bias in
domestic consumption. With this assumption, the true share of traded goods decreases from
ω = 0.21 to ω = 0.21 − 0.025 = 0.185 and α1 = 0.08/0.185 = 0.43.16 We call this the case of
bias in the consumption of the traded goods.

The results

Table 3 reports wealth shares, i.e. the share of total wealth of a domestic agent that is held
in the form of one of the four assets available, and equity shares i.e. the share of the value
of equity in a particular industry that is owned by domestic agents, in the separable case of
SD. As detailed below in section (3.1.1), if utility is separable and there is no consumption bias
in traded goods, then the model implies that the –average– share of foreign equity held in the
domestic equity portfolio is equal to the average share of imports in GDP. That is, the model
13

Burstein et al, 2005, report a total import content in US consumption of 9.1%. Local goods are mostly
exportable goods that are consumed locally.
14
This is a standard results in models where all diversifiable risk is perfectly shared.
15
The behavior of the prices of these goods lies in between that of non–traded and traded. See Burstein et al.,
2005.
16
In both cases, the steady state levels of the endowments are adjusted so that the relative price of the foreign
traded good is one.

where all of these quantities are measures as a % of GDP.
We have used data on foreign portfolio equity assets and liabilities from Lane–Milesi–Feretti,
2006, and data on market capitalization from the World Development Indicators to compute sij
for financially developed countries. Figure 3 reports this share as well as the imports–GDP share.
As in Table 1 the match is nearly perfect. A similarly good match obtains in individual years,
in subperiods and so on. The result is very robust. The fit is not as good when less developed
countries are included but this is not surprising given the widespread use of capital controls
and the presence of severe official and unofficial financial impediments in those countries. Our
model does not apply to such cases. Similarly, the fit is lower when very open economies, such
as Ireland or Singapore, are included in the sample. This is due to the fact that the reported
degree of openness overstates the true one due to re-exporting. This issue is taken up below.
10

It should be noted that ours is not the only paper to explore the link foreign asset holding and
the degree of openness. Heathcote and Perri, 2007, have performed a related exercise. They
use different measures of openness and, more importantly, of the share of asset holdings. Their
results are broadly consistent with the notion that trade in goods is an important determinant
of asset trade17 .

Nevertheless, there are good reasons for suspecting that the match seen in table 1 and in figure
3 may be implausibly good. This is due to the existence of important discrepancies between the
measures of trade and wealth in the model and in the data. In particular, gross trade flows and

value added coincide in our model but not in the data. A great deal of trade involves intermediate
products, and some of these goods are used in the production of exportables. Subsequently, the
imports share needs to be adjusted for re-exports in order to arrive at an empirical measure of
openness that corresponds to that in the model.
On the asset side, there are two problems with the wealth share used above. First, the model
abstracts from the most important form of equity for households, namely, housing. In the
appendix, we include housing by adding another equity that generates a flow of non-traded
services and which is not traded in international equity markets18 . We show that the share of
foreign equity in domestic wealth (inclusive of housing) is equal to the imports share even in the
extended model (under separability).
The second problem is that the model abstracts from multinational firms. Investing in domestic
firms that operate abroad and/or own foreign assets is an indirect way for domestic investors to
obtain international portfolio diversification. Hence, focusing only on the direct domestic and
foreign equity components of the portfolio overestimates the degree of portfolio home bias.
Before proceeding to describe how we have dealt with these issues, it is instructive to derive
the implied share of foreign equity in the domestic portfolio in the model that includes housing
equity as a component of the domestic wealth (the modified model can be found in Appendix
C.2).
Computing the share of foreign equity in wealth
The share of foreign equity in total domestic equity wealth, s̃ij , is given by
Aij
(16)
Aij + Aii + AH
i
where Aij is domestic claims on –tradeable– foreign capital, Aii is domestic claims on –tradeable–
s̃ij =

domestic capital, and AH
i is the value of domestic housing.
Let re-write the share as

where Ai is the capitalization of the stock market in country i and sij is defines as

sij =

Aij
Aij + Aii

18

(18)

In the separable case it does not matter whether equity in housing is internationally traded or not. In
equilibrium, all domestic housing is owned by domestic agents.

12

Solving equation (18) for Aii /Aij gives
Aii
= s−1

(19)

We now determine Ai /Aii . Using the definitions of the shares, we have
Aij
= (1 − sij )−1 − 1 ≡ k1
Aii

(20)

Aji
= (1 − sji )−1 − 1 ≡ k2
Ajj

(21)

Let Ai = zAj , where z > 0. z captures the relative size of the two stock markets, i and j. Using
(20)-(21) to substitute for Aij and Aji in the equation Aii + Aji = z(Ajj + Aij ) leads to the
following:
z − k2

Making the corrections
We need information on –properly measured– sij , sji as well as on AH
i /Ai and z. And on the
trade side, we need to adjust imports for the foreign content of domestic exports.
Let us start with re-exports. Hummels et al., 2001, use input-output tables to compute the
share of imported goods that is used as input to produce export goods for 10 OECD countries
over the period 1970-1990. They find a substantial amount of re-exporting, ranging from a low
of 11% of exports for the US and Japan to a high of 35% for Netherlands (in 1990). Chen et
al., 2005, offer updated figures for these countries, which reveal that the degree of re-exporting
increased further during the 1990s. For the US, this figure was 12.3% in 1997, the last year
reported in Chen et al. Note that these figures refer to goods trade, there exists no information
on the foreign valued added component of exports of domestic services19 .
19

Services are about 27% of total (goods and services) US trade.

13

The calculation of the market value of the housing stock is notoriously difficult, specially in an
international context, due to the existence of serious measurement problems. We will rely on
three alternative measures. The first is due to Case-Quigley-Shiller, 2005. They estimate real
housing market wealth per capita for owner occupied housing in the US20 , up until 1999 using
the Case-Shiller approach. They also report the ratio of the owner-occupied housing stock to
the total housing stock for 1999, so one can compute the total value of housing. The ratio of
the value of the housing stock to that of the stock market (stock market capitalization) in the
1990s falls in the interval21 0.8 − 1.0.
The second measure uses the market value of the real estate holdings of US households22 reported
in the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds. The AH
i /Ai ratio is constructed by dividing this value
by stock market capitalization in the US (AMEX, NYSE, NASDAQ). The average value over
1995-2004 is 0.93.
The third measure utilizes the value of US housing constructed by Davis and Heathcote (2008).
With this measure, the average ratio of housing to stock market capitalization over 1995-2004
is 1.18.
The relative size of stock markets, z, can be computed using data on stock market capitalization
from the World Federation of Exchanges Members ( http : /www.world − exchanges.org). The
average ratio of US (AMEX, NYSE, NASDAQ) versus non-US stock markets, Ai /Aj , is 0.90
(for 1995-2004).
The third issue concerns the measurement of the share of foreign stocks in the total portfolio
of stocks (s̃ij , s̃ji ). The problem with the standard measures (such as those used in Table 4)
is that they only contain the direct shares, which may be different from the effective shares.
These shares coincide in the model but not in the data. It is well known that holding stocks
of multinational firms may represent an indirect way of holding foreign equity. Determining
the degree to which stocks in multinationals contribute to international portfolio diversification
and thus constructing the effective share of foreign assets in domestic wealth is a difficult task.
In a recent paper, Cai and Warrock, 2004, attempt this for the US. They run a factor model
to calculate –for each firm– the extent to which its foreign beta varies with the amount of
its foreign operations. And they then use this information to compute indirect foreign equity
holdings. Adding the indirect to the direct holdings allows them to calculate the effective
holdings. Namely, the share of foreign equities in US equity portfolios, sij , and the share of
US equities in foreign equity portfolios, sji . The average value of the former over 1995-2003 is
20

They also compute the value of housing for some other OECD countries, but these values are not comparable
across countries.
21
There is some time variation. For instance, it is 0.83 in 1995-99, 0.96 over 1992-1999 and 1.05 over 1990-1999.
22
Including also the real estate holdings of non-profit institutions has a very small effect on AH
i /Ai .

14

around 19% and of the latter about 16%.
There exists no comparable information that would allow us to make these important corrections
on the asset side (housing and effective foreign assets) for countries23 other than the US. So we
limit ourselves to the US. Table 4 reports the implications of the model for the share of foreign
H
equity assets in domestic wealth as a function of AH
i /Ai . Due to the uncertainty about Ai /Ai

we compute this share for various values within the range of available estimates.

Note: Net US imports are calculated by subtracting the foreign content of domestic exports (re-exports)
from imports. The share of foreign value added in US goods exports was 12.3% in 1997 (the last year
reported by Chen et al., 2005).

The simple model with traded and non traded goods thus implies a share of foreign equity in
wealth that is remarkably close to that observed in the real world. Admittedly, this represents
only one observation, so it is only suggestive rather than conclusive. Nevertheless, we view this
finding as confirming the view, first elaborated24 by Stockman and Dellas, 1988, that trade in
goods is the key determinant of international equity portfolios. The fact that the underlying
composition of the consumption basket between traded and non traded goods is also satisfied
by the data –as Burstein et al. 2005 establish– increases confidence in the theory.
Having argued that that trade in goods is sufficient for understanding international equity portfolios we now turn to the discussion of the underlying intuition. This will also help shed some
light on the driving forces behind portfolio allocations in general. We then proceed to investigate
the conditions under which the model also generates home bias in traded goods equity.

own equity in the non–traded goods sector in two ways. First, it affects the value of the stream
of dividends in proportion to the number of shares held. And second, it affects the expenditure
needed to finance the consumption of the non–traded good (because of the price change). If a
domestic investor holds 100% of the domestic non–traded good equity and also consumes 100%
of that good then the gain (loss) as an investor exactly offsets the loss (gain) as a consumer.
If utility is separable (σρ = 1) then traded and non–traded goods are neither substitutes nor
complements. That is, variation in consumption of the non–traded good does not change the
agents’ utility from consumption of the traded good (and vice versa). In this case it is optimal to
hold 100% of the domestic non–traded good equity (and 0% of the foreign) in order to prevent
any international wealth redistribution following shocks to the non–traded good endowment.
There is no need to have any redistribution —which would lead to changes in the relative shares
of the traded good consumption bundle across the two countries— as the marginal utility of
the consumption of the traded goods is independent of the amount of the non–traded good
consumed.
Observation 2: Investors choose to hold a 50% share in each of the two traded goods –domestic
and foreign– industries.
With separability between traded and non traded goods and similar preferences over traded
goods across countries, SD show that the efficient level of consumption of traded goods is cy11t =
cy21t = y1t /2 and cy12t = cy22t = y2t /2 (see also the solutions for ciit in the Appendix A.4). This
consumption pattern can be supported if each country holds a 50% share in each of the two
traded goods.
We can now establish that such a portfolio implies that the average share of domestic wealth
invested in foreign equity is equal to the average degree of trade openness (imports to GDP
share). The average degree of openness in country 1 is
t1 =

As shown in the appendix A.2, the average ratio of stock prices Qz /Qy is equal to the average
ratio of the dividends associated with these stocks, Z1 /Y1 . Consequently, the model implies
s12 = t1 .
It is worth mentioning that we have also solved an augmented version of the model that also
contains explicitly a distribution sector25 . The details are described in Appendix C.1, where
we also show that the introduction of a distribution sector does not alter the implication of the
model regarding the equality of the foreign equity share and the imports/GDP share.

Extensions

In this section we modify the two key assumptions of the model studied above: Namely, that
utility is separable in traded and non-traded goods. And that there exists no bias in the consumption basket of the traded goods. There exist three motivations for undertaking these
modifications. First, to examine whether the –small– gap between the model implied foreign
equity share and that observed in the data (table 4) can be bridged by departing from these two
assumptions. Second, to discover the conditions under which the model can also generate biases
within the traded goods equity sub-portfolio. And third, given the uncertainty surrounding the
values of some important parameters (for instance, the elasticity of substitution between traded
and non-traded goods), to check the sensitivity of the results to plausible variation in parameter
values.
4.0.2

Non-separability

We first explore the implications of non-separability for optimal portfolios.
Non–separable utility (σρ 6= 1), no consumption bias (α = 0.5)
We relax the assumption of separability by allowing σρ to depart from unity. Moreover, we
will assume that ρ < 1. In this case, the domestic and foreign traded goods are substitutes
(d2 u/dcy11 dcy12 < 0) if the traded goods are more substitutable among themselves than they are
with the non–traded goods, that is, if ϕ > ρ. This is an assumption that we will maintain
throughout this section26 .
25

Recall that Burstein et al., 2005, emphasize that the omission of this sector is the source of the mismeasurement of the contribution of non-traded goods to consumption.
26
Standard calibrations typically set ϕ > 1 and ρ < 1.

17

We now study the effects of a non–traded shock on consumption. The following proposition
describes the changes in efficient consumption27 .

The effects of traded goods shocks on efficient consumption allocations as well as the supporting
portfolios can be studied in a similar fashion (see the appendix A.5).
Let us assume that σρ < 1, so that non–traded and traded are complements. In an efficient equilibrium, we want consumption of traded goods to be higher in the country that has experienced
a positive endowment shock in its non–traded sector, because the increase in the consumption
of non–traded goods increases the marginal utility of consumption of the traded good. But this
implies that we want this country to experience a redistribution of income in its favor. This
would happen if some of the shares of firms producing domestic non–traded goods were held by
foreign investors. In this case, the gain to the domestic agents as consumers of the non–traded
good would exceed their loss as investors in that good, because while they consume 100% of it
they hold less than 100% of its equity. The foreign agents suffer an investment loss without reaping any consumption benefit. The resulting income redistribution allows the domestic agents to
claim a larger proportion of the traded goods bundle. Hence, the optimal portfolio here involves
holding a large share –almost unity– in the domestic non–traded sector and a small28 share
in the foreign non–traded sector. This is illustrated in the top row of Table 5. Here we have
used the same parametrization as in the separable case (with σ = 2) except for the elasticity of
substitution between traded and non traded which takes the value ρ = 0.4.

Exactly the same type of reasoning establishes that the domestic agents will want to hold more
than 100% of the domestic non–traded equity and will want to short foreign non traded goods
equity if traded and non–traded goods are substitutes, that is, if σρ > 1. The second row of
Table 6 reports asset shares under the assumption that ρ = 0.6.

4.0.3

Consumption bias

Separable utility (σρ = 1), consumption bias (α 6= 0.5)
We now turn to the issue of portfolio bias in the traded goods equity. One way of accomplishing
this is by introducing a bias in the consumption of the traded goods29 . A standard implication
of trade theory –see below– is that there should be foreign bias in traded goods consumption.
Suppose that this is the case (αi < 0.5). Assume also that σρ = 1. Does this make the domestic
investors want to hold an equity share in the domestic traded that exceeds or falls short of 0.5?
Consider a positive shock to the domestic traded endowment. Let us hold consumption of the
foreign traded good constant and allow the consumption of the domestic traded good to increase
by the same proportion in the two countries. Because of the foreign bias in traded consumption,
foreign consumption of traded goods increases by more than domestic consumption of traded
goods. If ϕ > ρ, the marginal utility of both the domestic and foreign traded good is decreasing
in total traded good consumption. This implies that the marginal utility of both traded goods
has decreased more abroad that at home, violating the risk sharing principle. In order for the
marginal utilities to be equalized, the domestic consumption of the traded goods must increase
by a larger proportion than foreign consumption. In other words, the ratio of domestic to foreign
expenditures of traded goods must increase. This result is described in the next proposition.
Proposition 2 Let Θt denote the ratio of domestic to foreign traded expenditures
Θt =

In order to support the efficient equilibrium, asset holdings must be such that dividend income
at home increases by more than dividend income abroad following a positive shock to the endowment of the domestic traded good. What portfolio shares will deliver this? The next proposition
addresses this question.
29
The role of consumption bias for generating portfolio home bias has been investigated by Kollmann, 2006b in
a model without any non-traded goods and home consumption bias. Kollmann finds that, in order for his model
to generate an overall degree of portfolio home bias that exceeds the degree of consumption home bias, it must
be the case that the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign traded goods falls within a narrow
range strictly below unity (see Kollmann, 2006b). This requirement may be problematic as typical estimates of
the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign traded goods not only exceed unity but they can be
quite high. A specification with non traded goods does not suffer from this weakness.

19

Proposition 3 When the elasticity of substitution between traded and non traded goods is less than
unity (ρ < 1), traded goods are suitably substitutable among themselves (ϕ > ρ+(1−ρ)/4α(1−α))
and there is foreign bias in traded goods (α < 0.5), then the optimal portfolio allocation exhibits
home portfolio bias in traded goods industries.
In order to understand this result, recall that the holdings of non–traded goods equity are not
affected by the value of α as long as σρ = 1, hence, these shares remain at 100% and 0%
respectively. In contrast, the appropriate holdings of traded goods equity depend on the value
of α. If α < 0.5 (foreign bias in the consumption of traded goods) then the supporting portfolio
y
y
of traded goods equity must have a home bias (S11
> 0.5, S12
< 0.5), as long as ϕ > 1. With

ϕ > 1, the increase in the endowment of the domestic traded good will lower its relative price
y
but less than one for one. Holding shares S21
< 0.5 still allows the foreign consumer to consume

more of the domestic tradeable because of its lower relative price. But, at the same time, it
makes relative dividend incomes move in favor of the domestic agents, which allows them to
claim a larger share of world tradeables (we argued above that this is a property of an efficient
equilibrium).
The numerical results corresponding to the case of consumption bias and separability under the
parametrization in the second column of Table 2 appear in Table 6.

Foreign consumption bias generates home bias in the traded goods equity sub-portfolio30 and
it also increases the degree of portfolio home bias. Nevertheless, as the comparison of Tables 6
and 3 reveals, this effect is rather small quantitatively.
Under home bias in the consumption of tradeables, α > 0.5, the opposite pattern obtains. That
is, there is foreign bias in the portfolio of traded goods equity. Nevertheless, overall portfolio
home bias may still obtain. If the share of non–traded goods in the CPI is not too much below
50%, there will be home bias in consumption and portfolio independent of whether α is greater
30

Kollmann, 2006b, draws on Kang and Stulz, 1997, who report the existence of home bias in the shares of
Japanese manufacturing, to claim the existence of home bias in the equity of traded goods. This interpretation
is not justified as domestic consumption of foreign manufactures contains a significant domestic non–traded
component (see Berstein et al., 2005). Interestingly, Kang and Stulz report that foreign investors hold larger
equity positions in the manufacturing sector and lower ones in the wholesale and retail distribution as well as
in services. This finding highlights the importance of the distinction between traded and non–traded goods for
portfolio choice and offers support to the key thesis of our paper.

20

or smaller than 0.5.
The link between consumption and portfolio bias suggested above may seem paradoxical when
looked through the prism of some interesting, extreme cases. Suppose, for instance, that only the
domestic agents consume the foreign traded good (and vice versa). And that utility is separable
between traded and non-traded goods. Under these circumstances, optimal hedging would have
the domestic agents hold all of the foreign traded good equity. Or, suppose instead, that only
the domestic agents consume the domestic traded good (and analogously for the foreign agents).
Under these circumstances, optimal hedging would have the domestic agents hold all of the
domestic traded good equity. Both of these cases seem to violate the spirit of Proposition 3
as they involve a positive rather than negative link between consumption and portfolio bias.
Nonetheless, there is no contradiction between this proposition and these examples. When α
is driven to zero (the first example) or to unity (the second example) then the right hand side
in the second condition in Proposition 3 is driven to infinity, the proposition does not hold
and it cannot be used to study optimal portfolios. One should view Proposition 3 as being a
useful tool for determining optimal portfolios within an appropriate range of parameter values.
Fortunately, for most economies in the real world, this appropriate range is also the empirically
relevant one31 .
For the sake of assessing the model’s prediction for bias in the traded goods equity, it is of
interest to consider whether α is likely to exceed or to fall short of 0.5 in the real world and by
how much.
We have already discussed how the CPI decomposition creates a presumption32 that α is below
(but not too much) 0.5. We have also carried a detailed study of the Swiss CPI. The documentation of the CPI only provides —precise— information on the domestic (or imports) content of
each item that enters the basket. A possible —but arbitrary— classification that does not rely
on an ad hoc assignment of items to the various categories (non–traded, domestic trade, foreign
traded) is to assign an item to the non–traded category if the domestic content is 100%, to the
foreign tradeable if the import content is more than 50% and to the domestic tradeable in all
other cases. Such a classification produces the values 60%, 11%, 29% for non–traded, domestic
tradeable and foreign tradeable respectively. While it is clear that this classification is far from
ideal as something may have 100% domestic content and still be a tradeable good, we view these
figures as indicating that the likelihood of foreign bias in traded goods is not negligible.
Finally, a strong case for foreign bias in the consumption of traded goods can be made based
31
Under the benchmark values of ρ = 0.5 and phi = 1.5, the second condition in Proposition 3 is violated when
alpha is either below 0.15 or above 0.85.

As Burstein et al., 2005, discuss, there exists no direct information on the domestic exportable goods component of the CPI.

on trade theory. Standard trade theory implies the existence of international specialization,
with countries typically producing a small range of traded goods and exporting most of their
tradeables production in exchange for a much broader set of foreign produced traded goods.
A similar prediction arises in the new trade models, to the extent that there are gains from
specialization, as it would be the case in the presence of returns to scale, country specific factors
and so on.

4.1

Sensitivity Analysis

We now turn to the investigation of how variation in the key parameters of the model affects the
composition of optimal portfolios. Table 7 provides information on the role of deviations from
separability and from symmetry in the consumption of traded goods. Tables 8 and 9 provide
information on the sensitivity of the results around the two baseline parametrizations reported in
Table 2. The results are quite robust. In the range of the parameter values considered there are
only two cases –both of them empirically unlikely– where the model fails to generate home bias
in portfolio. Namely, when the elasticity of substitution between traded and non–traded goods,
ρ, is very high (say, ρ = 5). And when the share of imports33 . in the domestic consumption
basket is very high (ω = 0.75), see Table 8. Note also that higher values of the elasticity of
substitution between domestic and foreign traded (as suggested by Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2000)
do not undermine home bias. This is encouraging because there is great uncertainty regarding
the precise value of this elasticity. The robustness of our results in the presence of plausible,
large variation in the parameters values is another advantage of our proposed solution to the
portfolio bias relative to other approaches. Those other approaches produce results that are
extremely sensitive to even slight but plausible variation in key parameters.

Conclusions

Investors tend to invest most of their wealth in domestic assets, and most of the capital in any
country is owned by the domestic residents. This is true even in countries that appear to be
well integrated within the world capital markets. A large literature has attempted to provide an
explanation to this phenomenon, with rather limited success so far. We show that the degree of
international trade in goods is the main determinant of international equity portfolios. A simple
model with traded and non–traded goods implies that international equity positions should
match import shares. Subsequently, to the extent that true –re-exports adjusted– import shares
fall short of 50%, international equity portfolios will exhibit a home bias.
33

We have already discussed what values of α make it unlikely for proposition 3 to be satisfied.

22

We compute the share of foreign equities in total domestic wealth for the US households, taking
into account their equity in housing and also their indirect foreign equity holdings that arise
from holding the stock of US multinationals. This share comes out at around 10% for the period
1995-2004. The corresponding ”true” US imports to GDP share, after correcting for the foreign
value added of US exports is around 11.7%. We interpreting this finding as suggesting that the
model offers a compelling explanation not only to the portfolio bias puzzle but also, and more
generally, to the determination of international portfolios.

Properties of the Solution

In the following, we review some properties of the log–linear solution of the model and report
the proofs of the main propositions reported in the main text.
Lemma 1 The dominator of each coefficient involved in the solution of the efficient allocation is
positive.
Proof: The denominator of each coefficient is always proportional to
∆ ≡ ρ − 4α(1 − α)(ρ − ϕ + $ϕ(1 − σρ))
which rewrites
∆ = ρ(1 − 4α(1 − α)) + ρσ$ϕ4α(1 − α) + 4α(1 − α)ϕ(1 − $)
By definition, 0 6 $ 6 1 and since 0 6 α 6 1, we have 4α(1 − α) 6 1. The result follows.

Proof: Let us first prove the first part of the result. Given that the denominator is positive,
and looking at the solution for cyiit , the sign of the response to yit is given by the sign of
ρ − (1 + α(1 − 2α))(ρ − ϕ(1 − $(1 − σρ)))
This quantity is strictly positive as long as
ϕ>

α(1 − 2α)ρ
(1 + α(1 − 2α))(1 − $(1 − σρ))

When α > 0.5, the right hand side of the inequality is negative. Since ϕ > 0 by assumption,
the inequality is always satisfied in that case. When α < 0.5, the inequality must hold.
Let us now prove the second part of the result. Given that the denominator of the solution
is positive, α ∈ (0, 1), $ ∈ (0, 1), ϕ > 0 and ρ > 0, the sign of the coefficient in front of yjt in
the solution of cyiit and cyijt is entirely determined by the sign of (1−2α)(ρ−ϕ(1−$(1−σρ))).
The result then follows.

Result 2 The effects of endowment shocks on the relative price of traded goods: The impact effect
of an endowment shock on the relative price of the foreign traded good satisfies

∂z2t
2
Proof:
1. We proved in result 1 that the denominator of the coefficient on endowments is positive.
Furthermore, 1 − $(1 − σρ) is positive. The result then follows.
2. Since the denominator of the coefficient is positive, the sign of the impact effect of a
shock on non–traded is given by the sign of (1 − 2α)(1 − ρσ). The result follows.
q.e.d.

Lemma 2 Assume that σρ = 1 and that the elasticity of substitution between traded and non
traded goods is less than unity (ρ < 1), then the relative price of the foreign traded good increases
less than one for one following an increase in the domestic endowment, provided domestic and
foreign traded goods are sufficiently good substitutes (ϕ > ρ +

1−ρ
4α(1−α) )

Proof:Lemma 2 Since ρσ = 1, ∂py2t /∂y1t reduces to
∂py2t
1
=
∂y1t
ρ − 4α(1 − α)(ρ − ϕ)
In the case where ρ < 1 (the case we consider) we have
∂py2t
< 1 ⇐⇒ ρ − 4α(1 − α)(ρ − ϕ) > 1
∂y1t
which amounts to
ϕ>ρ+

1−ρ
4α(1 − α)

since α ∈ (0, 1) and ρ < 1 the second term is positive. Note that in a neighborhood of
α = 0.5, 4α(1 − α) ' 1, it is sufficient that ϕ > 1.
q.e.d.

A.6

Proofs of Propositions
Proof (Proof of proposition 1): Given that the denominator is positive, α ∈ (0, 1), $ ∈ (0, 1),
ϕ > 0 and ρ > 0, the sign of the coefficient in front of z·t in the solution is entirely determined
by the sign of σρ − 1. The result then follows.

Θt =

y

its log–linear approximation is given by
ϑt = αcy11t + (1 − α)(py2t + cy12t ) − (1 − α)cy21t − α(py2t + cy22t )
Making use of (71)–(72), this rewrites as
ϑt = 2α(cy11t − cy22t ) + (1 − 2α)py2t − (y1t − y2t )
Plugging the solution of the log–linear version of the model, one gets
(1 − 2α)(1 − ρ − $(1 − σρ))
∂ϑt
=
∂y1t
ρ − 4α(1 − α)(ρ − ϕ + $ϕ(1 − σρ))
Let us then consider the case where ρσ = 1, this reduces to
∂ϑt
(1 − 2α)(1 − ρ)
=
∂y1t
(1 − 4α(1 − α))ρ + 4α(1 − α)ϕ
Since we established in Result 1 that the denominator is positive, the sign of the latter
derivative is given by the sign of
(1 − 2α)(1 − ρ)
The result follows.

Assuming that traded goods are highly substitutable (ϕ > ρ + (1 − ρ)/4α(1 − α)), we have

B.1

Higher Order Approximations

We first investigate the accuracy of the wealth and equity shares derived in the log-linear model
by computing the same shares under a second order perturbation. Table 10 reports the shares
under a first and a second order approximation for the two benchmark cases respectively. In the
case of a second order approximation, we report the average over 1000 simulations of the model.
For each simulation, we generate a time series of 1000 realizations of the four productivity shocks.
For each realization, we solve the model and compute the equity shares. We then average the
shares over the 1000 realizations to get the average share for a particular simulation. From
the resulting distribution of shares we compute the average across simulations as well as the
standard deviation of the shares. This allows us to judge whether the constant shares obtained
in a first order approximation are a good approximation.

Two main results emerge from the table. First, solving the model at a higher order approximation
does not make any difference for the level of wealth and equity shares. In a companion paper,
using a related model we show that the same is true even when one uses much higher order
approximations. Second, the shares when computed from a higher order approximation method
do not display any volatility. For instance, in the consumption bias case, the largest volatility
observed in wealth shares is about 0.002%. Consequently, working with constant shares in this
economy does not compromise the ability of the model to address the international portfolio
bias problem.

B.2

Checking for Market Completeness

Recall that we determine the wealth shares by projecting the budget constraint of the household
on each of the four shocks (see equation 14). Under a first order approximation, this method
delivers constant shares. Since the four wealth shares must sum to unity, we actually have five
equations in these four unknowns. Markets are effectively complete if there is a solution for the
wealth shares satisfying all five equations — thus making the following equation hold for all
realizations of the shocks
M (Yt ) • αt = L(Yt )

(81)

where Yt contains the four shocks of the model. When solving for the four shares, we use three
of the projections together with the condition that the wealth shares add up to one. One way
of checking for market completeness is by inspecting the residuals of the remaining –omitted–
projection. In particular, we obtain three wealth share from the projection of equation (81) on
the first three shocks and then obtain the fourth share from the requirement that the shares
add up to unity. We then substitute the shares in the –omitted– projection of equation (81)
on the last shock and check the size of its residual from zero. We repeat this for every possible
combination of the four projections. The results are reported in Table 11.

The first column tells which of the four projections were used in the calculation of the shares. The
second and third columns report the absolute value of the residual from the missing projection
for, respectively, the first order (P1) and the second order (P2) approximation in the separable
case. The last two columns report the same information in the consumption bias case. Under
a first order approximation, the residuals of the last equation are essentially zero in both cases,
hence, up to a first order approximation, markets are effectively complete in this economy.
Under a second order approximation, we need to solve each system of equations (projections)
for each realization of the shocks. We therefore simulate the model and solve the system for
each realization of the shocks. We then compute the average of the absolute value of the
residuals of the missing equation across simulations. We simulate the model 1000 times and
generate a time series of 1000 observations for each draw. As can be seen from the table, the
residuals are negligible also in the case of a second order approximation, an indication that
39

market completeness extends to higher orders of approximation.
An alternative to this approach is to check whether the risk sharing condition is satisfied. In a
perfectly symmetric world, perfect risk sharing implies that the marginal utility of consumption is
equated across countries.34 An equivalent statement is that the Lagrange multipliers associated
with the foreign and domestic households’ budget constraint are equal.
Due to the constancy of equity shares the budget constraint of the household takes the simple
form

Using the equity shares from Table 3 in the budget constraint and solving the optimization
problem of the domestic and foreign household allows us to compute the Lagrange multipliers.
Perfect risk sharing means that the domestic and foreign Lagrange multipliers are perfectly
correlated. We draw a time series for each shock and use the solution of the model to compute
the average and the standard deviation of the Lagrange multiplier in each country as well
as their correlation. We also report the maximal absolute deviation between the two Lagrange
multipliers. The moments are averaged across simulations. As in the preceding case, 1000 draws
of length 1000 are simulated. The results are reported in Table 12. These results establish that

the Lagrange multipliers are the same across the two economies: They have the same average
and standard deviation are perfectly positively correlated. The maximal absolute deviation is
about 1e-7, less than the tolerance criterion used when solving the non–linear problem. It is
worth noting that this test is extremely demanding as it actually tests for the joint hypothesis
that (i) there is perfect risk sharing and (ii) equity shares are constant over time.
Finally, we carried out one more test. We imposed three of the four equity shares and let the
households determine their optimal quantity of the fourth share. An advantage of this procedure
is that it does not require the imposition of perfect risk sharing and also does not suppress the
dynamics. In this case, the budget constraint takes the form

In a non symmetric world, perfect risk sharing implies that two marginal utilities be proportional across
countries— the proportionality factor being given by the ratio of initial wealths.

40

Again we then solve the model at the first and second order and simulate it. The same experiment
is repeated for each possible three share subset of the four equities. Table 13 reports moments
on the derived equity shares. Tables 14 and 15 report moments for the Lagrange multipliers
using respectively a first and a second order approximation. Again the results establish that the
model exhibits market completeness, that is, risk is perfectly shared across the two countries.
Note that the ”free” equity share, as computed by this method, is exactly equal to that obtained
under perfect risk sharing and is also constant over time.

support the complete asset markets allocation of resources up to a linear approximation. As in
Kollmann, 2006b, we will use this equivalence to determine asset holdings.

Relaxing the perfect symmetry assumption would simply have implied that λ1t ∝ λ2t where the proportionality
factor is given by the relative initial wealth ratio.

43

We use the same endowment process as in the main text.
The parametrization of the model is the same as in the benchmark model. We only need to
assign values to the two parameters pertaining to the production of flow of services, γ and ζ. We
consider a separable version of the model with no home bias. Given the corresponding calibration
for our benchmark model, this case corresponds to a situation where γ = 0.5 and ζ = 0.5. As
a second experiment, we consider a version in which we relax separability, while maintaining
the assumption of no home bias, by assuming that the two traded goods are complements. In
this case, we keep γ = 0.5, and set ζ = 0.25. We finally —arbitrarily— assume that about
one–fourth of the local goods is non–traded (say, 2.5%) rather than exportables. This implies
that the true share of domestic exportables in the domestic consumption basket is only 8%
rather that the 10.5% we used earlier (10.5% − 2.5%). This leads us to set α = 0.4683. We call
this the case of bias in traded consumption. Table 16 then reports the wealth and equity shares
for these calibrations, as weel as the import share (sm ). As can be seen from the table, in the

case (lowering ζ). Similarly, even withe home bias, the total share of foreign equities in total
wealth (0.1520) remains close to the import share (0.1050).

We use the same endowment process as in the main text. We however have to add an extra
endowment process for housing. We set the same process for housing as for the other goods.36
The parametrization of the model is the same as our benchmark model. We however have to
assign values to the two parameters37 pertaining to housing. In particular, we have to select a
value for ω2 . We set it such that it matches the ratio of housing to equity wealth in household
balance sheets, which is about 0.75 on US data. This led us to set ω2 = 0.42856. We then ran
the same experiments as in the main text. Table 17 reports the wealth and equity shares for
these calibrations, as well as the import share (sm ).
