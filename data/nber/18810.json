    "abstract": "\n\nParental involvement (PI) laws require that physicians notify or obtain consent from a parent(s) of a minor seeking an abortion before performing the procedure. Several studies suggest that PI laws curb risky sexual behavior because teens realize that they would be compelled to discuss a subsequent pregnancy with a parent. We show that prior evidence based on gonorrhea rates overlooked the frequent under-reporting of gonorrhea by race and ethnicity, and present new evidence on the effects of PI laws using more current data on the prevalence of gonorrhea and data that are novel to this literature (i.e., chlamydia rates and data disaggregated by year of age). We improve the credibility of our estimates over those in the existing literature using an event-study design in addition to standard difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) models. Our findings consistently suggest no association between PI laws and rates of sexually transmitted infections or measures of sexual behavior.\n\n",

Joyce\n\nFinancial Support\n\n\nThis study has been supported by a grant from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to the Research Foundation of the City University of New York (1RO3HD064760-01).  The total direct and indirect costs of the grant were $161,000 over the two-year period 2010-2012.\n\n\nProprietary data\n\n\nThe data on abortion providers by county from 1973 to 2008 was provided by Guttmacher Institute in New York.  We used these data to compute distance to the nearest abortion provider.  Researchers that would like to use these data must apply to the Guttmacher Institute.   We cannot share the data on abortion providers without permission from the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\nRelevant Relationships\n\n\nI served as a consultant to the Guttmacher Institute in 2008-2009.  I worked with researchers at the Guttmacher Institute on developing literature reviews on the impact of state abortion policies on reproductive outcomes.  I was paid $5,000 in total over this period.\n\n\nI served on the Editorial Advisory Committee for the journal, Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health published by the Guttmacher Institute from 2000-2008.\n\n\nRight to review\n\n\nNo other party has had the right to review this work before submission.\n\n\nIRB Approval\n\n\nThe project was approved by the Baruch College (CUNY) Institutional Review Board under Exempt status in 02/09/2012.\n\n\n"
