ABSTRACT
I define and provide empirical evidence for an “International Price System” in global trade employing
data for thirty-five developed and developing countries. This price system is characterized by two
features. First, the overwhelming share of world trade is invoiced in very few currencies, with the
dollar the dominant currency. Second, international prices, in their currency of invoicing, are not very
sensitive to exchange rates at horizons of up to two years. In this system, a good proxy for a country's
inflation sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations is the fraction of its imports invoiced in a foreign
currency. U.S. inflation is consequently more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while other
countries are highly sensitive to it. Exchange rate depreciations (appreciations) make U.S. exports
cheaper (expensive), while for other countries they mainly raise (lower) mark-ups and hence profits.
U.S. monetary policy has spillover effects on inflation in other countries, while spillovers from other
countries monetary policies on to U.S. inflation are more muted.

Introduction

The relative price of a country’s currency, that is its exchange rate, is the protagonist in debates
on international spillovers of monetary policy and international trade competitiveness. Yet, the
popular discourse on how exchange rate fluctuations impact inflation and trade is often quite
simplistic. An exchange rate depreciation is perceived to be inflationary as the price of imported
goods rise, and is perceived to improve a country’s trade balance as it becomes more competitive.
What appears to be absent is a systematic notion of why inflation in some countries may be more
sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations than others.
I will argue that there are indeed systematic features of international prices that provide
concrete predictions for the sensitivity of a country’s inflation to exchange rate fluctuations. In
addition there are important asymmetries across countries in the degree of sensitivity. Accordingly
I define an ‘International Price System’ characterized by two key features: Firstly, the overwhelming share of world trade is priced/invoiced in a small set of currencies, with the dollar the dominant
currency. Secondly, international prices in their currency of invoicing 1 are not very sensitive to
exchange rates at horizons of up to two years. This implies that a good proxy for the sensitivity
of a country’s traded goods inflation to exchange rates is the fraction of its imports invoiced in a
foreign currency (that is, not in its own currency). The higher this fraction the greater the sensitivity of traded goods inflation to exchange rate fluctuations and by extension to global shocks.
I assemble data on prices and currency invoicing shares for thirty five developed and developing
countries to establish these facts.
As an example take the case of three countries, the U.S., Japan and Turkey. As defined by
the I.M.F. the U.S. and Japan are developed countries and Turkey is an emerging/developing
country. Figure 1 plots the pass-through into the aggregate import price index2 (and 2-standarderror bands) for each of the three countries, estimated using quarterly data over the sample period
1990-2014. The estimation details are provided in Section 2. In the case of Turkey (thick solid line),
1

I will use the currency of invoice terminology to describe the currency in which prices are denominated. While
the invoicing currency does not necessarily have to be the same as the currency of denomination, in practice they
are, as documented in Friberg and Wilander (2008).
2
Specifically for Japan and Turkey it is the import price index (unit value) from the International Financial
Statistics database (IFS). For the U.S. it is the import price index excluding petroleum from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS).

Figure 1: A Tale of Three Countries
a 10% depreciation of the Turkish Lira relative to its trading partners results in its import prices
in Lira rising by 9.3% one quarter after the shock and by 10.0% eight quarters after the shock, a
horizon referred to as the ‘long-run’.3 For Japan (thick short-dashed line) a 10% yen depreciation
relative to its trading partners raises its prices by 8.3% after one quarter and cumulates to 9.0%
after eight quarters, that is a ninety percent pass-through in the long-run. In the case of the U.S.
(thick dashed line) the numbers are much lower at 3.4% and 4.4%, that is 44% pass-through in
the long-run.4
There are two striking features of Figure 1. Firstly, while Japan and the U.S. are more similar in
3

It is empirically a challenge to estimate the ‘very’ long-run impact that exceeds two years. As highlighted in
Rogoff (1996) the “consensus view” for the average half-life of real exchange rate deviations for developed countries
is 3-5 years, and the confidence bands surrounding these estimates are large as shown by Murray and Papell (2002)
and Rossi (2005).
4
This high degree of pass-through for Turkey and Japan is also estimated for sub-indices of import prices. For
instance, the pass-through (standard error) into the manufacturing sub-sample of import prices for Turkey is 0.99
(0.06) in the short-run and 1.02 (0.08) in the long-run. In the case of Japan these numbers for manufacturing are
0.93 (0.11) in the short-run and 0.90 (0.21) in the long-run.

3

terms of income levels and the reserve currency status of their currencies, pass-through into Japan
is both quantitatively and statistically similar to Turkey as compared to the U.S. Secondly, for
each country there is little difference between its short-run and long-run pass-through as evident
from the lack of any significant slope in the pass-through lines.
Both of these features can be accounted for by the definition of the International Price System.
Both Turkey and Japan invoice a small fraction of their imports in their home currency, 3% and
24% respectively. Sixty percent of Turkey’s imports are invoiced in dollars even though imports
from the U.S. comprise on average 6% of its total imports. Similarly, 71% of Japanese imports
are invoiced in dollars, while the U.S. trade share of its imports is only on average 13%. Unlike
Japan and Turkey, 93% of U.S. imports are invoiced in its home currency, dollars. These facts
are consistent with the first piece of the definition on dollar dominance in trade invoicing. When
combined with the second piece of the definition that international prices in their currency of
invoicing are not very sensitive to exchange rates at horizons of up to two years, the pass-throughs
depicted in Figure 1 follow straightforwardly. Because 76% (97%) of Japan’s (Turkey’s) imports
are invoiced in a currency not its own and that price has low sensitivity to the exchange rate, the
pass-through into its own currency from exchange rate fluctuations will be high both in the short
and long-run. Conversely, pass-through into U.S. import prices in dollars will be low both in the
short and long-run.
As I demonstrate in the paper, this phenomenon that ties pass-through rates to currency
invoicing and that keeps long-run pass-through rates close to short-run pass-through rates is
a robust finding across many specifications. Firstly, evidence for Japan, Turkey and the U.S.
extends to many other countries. Secondly, using detailed import price data for the U.S. I show
that it holds even within countries and within sectors as detailed as 10-digit HS codes for goods
invoiced in different currencies. That is, even for the U.S., the subset of its imports that are priced
in foreign currency have the same high pass-through as what is observed for Turkey and Japan.
Thirdly, it holds even when one conditions on price changes. That is goods invoiced in a foreign
currency have higher pass-through into home currency prices as compared to goods invoiced in
the home currency even conditional on a price change. Lastly, it holds for the sub-sample of trade
transactions that are arms-length and not intra-firm.
4

The International Price System (IP S) has several implications for monetary policy and for
the international spillovers of monetary policy. Firstly, it has positive implications for inflation
stabilization. The IP S implies that inflation stabilization in response to exchange rate fluctuations
(that arise from external shocks) is a smaller concern for the U.S. as compared to countries like
Turkey. Using input-output tables to measure the import content of consumer goods expenditure5
I estimate the direct impact of a 10% dollar depreciation to cumulatively raise U.S. CPI inflation
over two years by 0.4-0.7 percentage points.6 On the other hand a 10% depreciation of the Turkish
Lira will raise cumulative inflation by 1.65-2.03 percentage points.
As the U.S. considers raising interest rates one concern often expressed is the consequence of the
dollar appreciation on inflation. According to the IP S moderate dollar appreciations are unlikely
to generate major disinflationary concerns for the U.S. but important inflationary concerns for a
country like Turkey as its currency depreciates relative to the dollar.
On the flip side, dampening (raising) inflation to meet targets via contractionary (expansionary) monetary policy receives much less support from the exchange range channel for the U.S.
than it does for Turkey.
Secondly, the IP S has implications for export competitiveness and trade balance adjustment
following exchange rate fluctuations. An exchange rate depreciation (appreciation) is perceived
to make a country’s exports immediately cheaper (expensive) on world markets. However for
the vast majority of countries whose exports are invoiced in a foreign currency this is unlikely
to be the case. Consider Japan that has only 33% of its exports invoiced in its home currency.
A yen depreciation will make only a small fraction of its exports cheaper, but instead will raise
the mark-ups and hence profits of its exporting firms. This will be even more true for developing
countries that typically have close to a 100% of their exports invoiced in a foreign currency. On
the other hand, a dollar depreciation will make almost all of U.S. exports cheaper given that 97%
of its exports are invoiced in dollars (home currency).
5

This includes both the direct import content measured as the fraction of consumption expenditure on imported
consumer goods and the indirect import content that is the value of imported inputs used in the production of
domestic consumer goods that enter the consumption bundle.
6
To be clear there are no permanent effects on inflation, only that following the exchange rate shock consumer
prices increase over two years by 0.4-0.7 percentage points. Further, this measures the impact of exchange rate
shocks, all else equal, that is, it does not incorporate any attenuation that can arise from an endogenous monetary
policy response.

5

The first and second implications together imply that trade balance adjustments, through
relative price effects, are more likely to be driven by adjustments in exports in countries like the
U.S., while being driven by adjustments in imports in countries like Turkey.
Thirdly, the IP S can generate asymmetries in monetary policy spillovers across countries.
Consider the extreme of a world with 100% dollar invoicing. In this world consider a tightening
of monetary policy in the U.S. This generates a stronger dollar and a weaker rest-of-the-world
(ROW) currency. The high pass-through into import prices in the ROW then puts pressure on
the ROW to tighten monetary policy as a consequence of the impact on inflation. On the other
hand, a monetary tightening in the rest of the world has very low impact on U.S. inflation and
consequently on U.S. monetary policy via the inflation channel.7 In reality while the world is
not 100% dollarized it is highly skewed towards dollar pricing and asymmetric monetary policy
impacts via inflation can be important. This provides another argument for countries that have a
large presence in world trade like China to internationalize their currency, as an increase in its use
in world trade will have the added benefit of insulating domestic inflation from external shocks.
Lastly, if firms were to price in SDRs, the IMF’s unit of account, this could bring about greater
symmetry. However for this to be optimal to adopt from an individual firm’s perspective it should
be simultaneously adopted by a large number of importers and exporters.
On going discussions of monetary policy spillovers focus on asset markets, with the prominence
of the dollar in world asset trade flagging concerns about a global credit cycle driven by U.S.
monetary policy, as in the important works of Rey (2013) and Bruno and Shin (2015). The IP S
implies a similar asymmetry driven by the prominence of the dollar in world goods trade. The
dollar is often described as enjoying an ‘exorbitant privilege’ owing to its reserve currency status
in asset markets. One could argue that the dollar also enjoys a ‘privileged insularity,’ as regards
inflation, owing to its invoicing currency status in world trade.
Finally I provide a theoretical discussion of how global value chains and global competition
in product markets give rise to and sustain the IP S when it is costly to adjust prices. When
prices are set flexibly currency invoicing is irrelevant. A Japanese firm selling to the U.S. should

For a complete analysis of monetary policy spillovers one needs to consider the impact on other welfare relevant
variables, besides inflation, such as the output gap. My statements are restricted to the inflation channel given this
symposium’s focus on inflation.

be indifferent between quoting a dollar price or quoting an equivalent yen price using the spot
exchange rate. This is however no longer the case when there are costs to renegotiating prices
and consequently prices are sticky in the invoicing currency. In this case when the firm chooses
its price and the invoicing currency it takes into account the implications for its profits during
the whole period when the chosen price will be in effect. Optimality implies that firms make
their choices to mimic how much they would pass-through if they could choose prices flexibly.
This so called ‘desired’ pass-through depends on the sensitivity of the firms’ marginal costs and
of its desired mark-up to exchange rate movements. Importantly, this sensitivity depends on the
currency invoicing choices of other exporters.
For instance, consider a Japanese firm exporting to the U.S. If the dollar is the predominant
currency of invoicing for other exporters, then the Japanese firm’s imported inputs are priced
in and (at least partially) sticky in dollars. This implies that its marginal costs in dollars are
less sensitive to exchange rate movements, and consequently the Japanese firm has low desired
pass-through into dollar prices and therefore will choose to price in dollars. A similar argument
applies to the mark-up channel. If the Japanese firm faces competition in the U.S. market from
other producers, both domestic and foreign, who set prices in dollars then profit maximization
requires that the firm keep its price stable relative to its competitors so as not to lose market share.
For this reason too its desired pass-through is low. During the period when the price is sticky
this low desired pass-through can be attained by invoicing in dollars, so that yen-dollar exchange
rate movements do not impact the dollar import price. Owing to these reasons, we should expect
to find short-run pass-through to be close to long-run pass-through, as the latter approximates
desired pass-through, which is what I find in the data. Importantly, if world trade markets are
characterized by a predominance of dollar invoicing then through network effects this incentivizes
any entrant exporter to also choose dollar invoicing.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 defines the IP S and presents empirical evidence for it.
Section 3 extends the analysis to consumer prices. Section 4 elaborates on the policy implications.
Section 5 provides a theoretical discussion of determinants of pass-through into import prices and
currency invoicing that rationalizes the existence of the IP S along with a survey of empirical
evidence on currency invoicing patterns. Section 6 concludes.

Empirical evidence on the International Price System

In this section I define the IP S and present empirical evidence for it. The theoretical discussion
of the link between pass-through and currency invoicing is provided in Section 5. I relegate details
of the data used in the empirical analysis to an online Appendix.

Definition 2.1. The International Price System is defined by:
1. Dominance of dollar invoicing in world trade
(a) Relative stability of invoicing patterns over time.
2. International prices, in their currency of invoicing, are not very sensitive to
exchange rates at horizons of up to two years.
(a) Countries with high short-run pass-throughs have high long-run pass-through.
(b) Countries with higher shares of imports invoiced in a foreign currency have higher
short-run and long-run pass-through.
(c) Conditional on a price change, prices in their currency of invoicing have low sensitivity
to exchange rate shocks.

IPS Definition 1: Dominance of dollar invoicing in world trade
The volume of global merchandize trade now stands at 19.05 trillion dollars8 having grown
tremendously over the last several decades. As is well known, much of world trade is invoiced
in very few currencies. Figure 2 provides evidence of this phenomenon using data from countries
that report both trade flows disaggregated by counter-party country and by currency. I build
on the empirical work of Goldberg (2013), Goldberg and Tille (2009a) and Ito and Chinn (2013)
and include additional countries/years in the sample (details reported in Appendix). Specifically
I study 43 countries for imports and 44 countries for exports. The countries with information on
both imports and exports are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia,
Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
8

This is defined as the average of world imports and exports.

Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. In addition, Malta and Peru
have imports data; and Algeria, Malaysia, and South Africa have exports data. These countries
represent approximately 55% of world imports, and 57% of world exports.

Figure 2: Dollar Dominance in World Trade: Aggregate
The top panel of Figure 2 represents the share of imports that are imported from the US,
Eurozone, or the rest of the world; versus the share of imports that are invoiced in dollars, euros,
or other currencies.9 Specifically, for each country I calculate the share of imports from the U.S.,
9

The trade shares data is the average of the quarterly data from 1999 - 2014 and the invoicing data is computed

9

from the Eurozone, and from all other sources as a share of its total imports.10 I then calculate a
weighted average of these shares across countries, weighted by the size of their imports, and this
is reported in the column labeled “Trade”. For the “Invoicing” column I construct the share of
each countries imports that are invoiced in dollars, in euros and in other currencies and plot the

Figure 3: Dollar Dominance in World Trade: By Country
These invoicing shares are likely highly conservative for the dollar and euro - in reality, the
dollar or euro shares are likely higher relative to the US or Eurozone trade. First, countries do
as the average of the post-1999 years for which we have data.
10
We exclude the U.S. from the sample because of course there is no “US” trade counter-party, which would only
serve to artificially increase the non-US trade and the dollar invoicing share.

10

not always report invoicing figures for 100% of their trade data. To be conservative, any residual
was tallied as other currencies. For instance, Algeria only reported 49% of its trade in Euros. The
residual 51% was ascribed to “Other”, even though much of it is likely in dollars. More generally,
currency invoicing information is scarcer for developing countries and they tend to overwhelmingly
invoice in dollars (outside of the euro area).11
Despite this the dollars share as an invoicing currency is estimated to be around 4.7 (3.1) times
its share in (my sample of) world imports (exports). The euro’s share is more closely aligned at
1.2 times for imports and exports. Figure 3 plots the dollar’s invoicing share in imports (black
bar) next to the share of imports from the U.S. (grey bar) for each country, and the overwhelming
use of the dollar in trade transactions is clearly evident. (Country names and ISO codes are listed
in Table ?? in the online Appendix.)
Figure 4 plots the foreign currency invoicing share for each country against its (log) per capita
GDP. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) represent imports and exports respectively. Countries with higher
GDP per capita rely less on foreign currency invoicing, however the relation is quite flat for a
significant range of values of per capita GDP. Within the group of countries with high GDP per
capita there is considerable variation in the foreign currency share, however this is mainly driven
by euro area countries. Figures 4(c) and 4(d) re-create the graphs excluding euro area countries
and as is evident, especially for imports, almost all countries except for the U.S. are bunched closer
to the 100% line. This is to be expected given the dominance of the dollar in world trade.
IPS Definition 1a: Relative Stability of invoicing patterns over time
For the countries that have at least ten years of data I plot in Figure 5 the share of its imports
invoiced in a foreign currency, that is in a currency not its own. These countries include Australia,
Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, Thailand, Turkey, South Korea and the United States. The
shares are quite stable over time. In the case of Japan the share of invoicing in yen increased
during the nineteen eighties but has been very stable after that.
The exception to this would be countries in the eurozone after the adoption of the euro when
11

I also exclude China from the sample because it has far too little data (7% of its invoicing data is in yuan, and
the other 93% is unlabeled). Anecdotally, it is known that China’s trade is predominantly in dollars and Euros,
despite the fact that it trades substantial volumes with Asian countries too; and so inclusion of China will further
increase dollar or euro prominence, relative to US or Eurozone trade.

Figure 5: Fraction Priced in Foreign Currency
invoicing in home currency shares should have risen significantly. There is limited reliable currency
invoicing information for the years prior to the euro.12 However, what this highlights is that it
takes a dramatic event such as the formation of a currency union to shift invoicing patterns.
IPS Definition 2: International prices, in their currency of invoicing, are not very sensitive to exchange rates at horizons of up to two years.
I present evidence for this using aggregated and disaggregated price data. For all aggregate
price indices I use quarterly data and the sample period is set to start at 1990 so as to exclude
episodes of hyperinflation in some countries in our sample and also to focus on a time period when
most countries are on floating exchange rates for at least the majority of the sample period.13
Ideally the price indices should exclude commodity prices given that they are determined by

Ito and Chinn (2013) present some evidence of increasing euro adoption in the European Union.
We also restrict the sample to countries with at least thirty quarters of data.

13

demand and supply conditions in world markets and not the focus of this paper, which is about
goods for which firms have some pricing power.14 Such indices are however not readily available for
many countries and accordingly for all countries I use the import price index for all commodities.
The only exception is the U.S. for which I use the import price index excluding petroleum. The
biases of not excluding commodity prices are particularly severe for the U.S. given the close comovement between the dollar and commodity prices that are driven by global market conditions.15
IPS Definition 2a: Countries with high short-run passthroughs have high long-run
pass-through.
Pass-through is an empirical concept that measures the sensitivity of a country’s import price
to fluctuations in its nominal exchange rate relative to that of its trading partners. The policy
relevant question often is if a country’s currency depreciates (appreciates) by a certain percent by
what percent does that raise (lower) the home currency price of goods it imports.16 The shortrun pass-through measures the impact on prices over a short duration such as one quarter, while
long-run pass-through measures the impact over a longer duration, typically two years.
In order to estimate pass-through I will employ a dynamic lag specification that is standard
in the empirical literature, as in Campa and Goldberg (2005) and Burstein and Gopinath (2014).
The regression takes the form below,

∆ipin,t = αn +

T
X

βn,k ∆en,t−k + γn Xn,t + εn,t

(1)

k=0

where ∆ipin,t represents the log change in the import price index in country n at time t, expressed
in country n’s currency. ∆en,t−k represents the log change in the trade weighted nominal exchange
rate in country n at time t − k. k > 0 allows for lags in the pass-through of the trade weighted
14

Please see Alquist et al. (2013) for an in-depth analysis of the relation between exchange rates and commodity
prices.
15
I verify this by using manufacturing sub-indices for some countries and find that unlike the case for the U.S.
the estimates are very similar for the all-commodities and manufacturing only indices.
16
The source of the nominal exchange rate fluctuation, such as whether it is a monetary shock or a financial shock,
clearly will have implications for the estimated exchange rate pass-through via its impact on other components of
a firms costs such as wages, if not appropriately controlled for. However, for horizons of two years and less, these
other endogenous responses can be weak and consequently the estimates may not be very sensitive to the source of
the shock. Importantly also, as I discuss in Section 5, the relevant pass-through estimate that ties pass-through to
currency invoicing shares is the unconditional pass-through from exchange rates to prices. The standard omitted
variable concerns that arise with pass-through regressions are therefore not an issue here.

exchange rate into prices. The nominal exchange rate is expressed as home currency per unit
of foreign currency. Consequently a positive (negative) value for ∆en,t−k represents a nominal
depreciation (appreciation) of the home currency. Xin,t controls for the trade-weighted change in
the cost of production of exporting countries. Specifically I use contemporaneous and eight lags of
the change in the trade-weighted nominal exchange rate and trade weighted producer price index
of exporting countries. The construction of trade weighted exchange rates and producer prices is
described in the online Appendix ??.

After estimating the βn,k coefficients I obtain cumulative pass-through rates P Tn,T = Tk=0 βk

at horizon T for each country. I define P Tn,1 = 1k=0 βn,k as short-run pass-through. By including
the contemporaneous and one-lag effect on prices I allow for the possible difference in timing
of when import prices are reported and exchange rates are measured in the data, which can bias
estimates. According to IPS Description 2a countries with high P Tn,1 should have high cumulative
pass-through at longer horizons. That is, a regression

P Tn,T = γT + ηT P Tn,1 + εn,T ,

for T > 1

should generate in the case when the pass-throughs are identical γT = 0 and ηT = 1.

I exclude countries for which the pass-through estimates behave erratically, switching between positive and
negative numbers. These include Austria, Belgium, Greece, India, Luxembourg, Poland and Portugal.
18
I acknowledge that the standard errors need to be corrected for the generated regressor bias and the statistical
tests needs to be interpreted with caution.
19
In the case when IPIs, NERs, and producer prices are co-integrated, dynamic lag regressions are misspecified.
To allow for cointegration a vector error correction model (VECM) should be estimated. However, as reported in
Burstein and Gopinath (2014) the VECM specification generates estimates that are highly unstable depending on
the sample period chosen and very imprecisely estimated. In addition for several countries we could not reject the
null that the log import price index, the log of the NER and the log of foreign PPI are not cointegrated.

currency have higher short-run and long-run pass-through.
The second fact ties the pass-through rates to the currency invoicing patterns of each country’s
import bundle. Specifically I estimate the following regression:

P Tn,T = θT + φF CSn + εn,T

(3)

for T = 1, 4, 8. F CSn is the share of the imports of country n that is not invoiced in the currency
of country n. I use the average foreign currency share across time for each country.20 The results
are reported in Tables 2 and 3 and Figures 10 and 11.
The top panel of Table 2 reports the results for 24 countries for which we have both pass-through
estimates and currency invoicing information. There is a positive relation between pass-through
estimates and foreign currency invoicing shares at the one, four and eight quarter horizon. This
is depicted in the figures.21 As is evident Germany is an outlier. Excluding Germany the positive

For some countries we only have partial invoicing information. If the missing information exceeds 20% of the
countries imports I exclude this country from analysis. I renormalize the shares to ensure they add up to one.

importers currency for seven advanced economies and shows the relation to be negatively sloped, consistent with

Table 2: Relation between Pass-through and Currency of Invoicing
relation is tighter as reported in the figures and tables.
According to these estimates an increase in the share of foreign currency invoicing has a
quantitatively significant effect on pass-through measures at short and long horizons. Based on
lower panel estimates, one-quarter (four-quarter) pass-through increases from 23% (29%) to 78%
(79%) as the foreign currency share rises from 0% to 100%. Similarly, the eight-quarter passthrough increases from 39% to 78% as the foreign currency share rises from 0% to 100%. The
impact of currency invoicing on pass-through extends therefore beyond the short-run to horizons
for which it is difficult to argue that price stickiness is still relevant.
Burstein et al. (2005) study episodes of large devaluations and report that for Argentina, Brazil,
Korea, Mexico and Thailand at-the-dock prices of imported goods rise almost one to one in home
currency with the exchange rate devaluation. This is consistent with the IP S and demonstrates
that even during crisis episodes countries whose imports are invoiced in a foreign currency, in this
case the dollar, experience large pass-through into their import prices in home currency.
I would like to highlight some important caveats for the euro area countries. Firstly, the
currency invoicing information corresponds to the post euro period while import pass-through is
estimated including the pre-euro period, starting in 1990. This poses a problem when estimating
Figures 11(a) and 11(b) in this paper.

Table 3: Relation between Pass-through and Currency of Invoicing: Developed
the link between pass-through and currency invoicing as the latter could have changed pre- and
post- euro.22 A second issue is that post-euro the variation in the right hand side variable in
the pass-through regressions, i.e. the variation in the trade weighted nominal exchange rate is
driven entirely by a country’s trade outside the euro area. This complicates the link between
pass-through estimates using aggregate import price indices and invoicing shares. For example if
a country in the euro area has almost all of its ex-euro area trade denominated in dollars, and
consistent with IP S, prices in their currency of invoicing are not sensitive to exchange rates, then
the pass-through estimate using only the post-euro sample may be high, even if the majority of its
trade is within the euro area and consequently it is reported as a low foreign currency invoicing
share country.23 Accordingly, I estimate equation 3 excluding euro countries. The coefficient (s.e)
for φ is 0.51 (0.20) for one quarter pass-through, 0.41 (0.18) for four quarter pass-through and
0.29 (0.19) for eight quarter pass-through. The positive relation between pass-through and foreign
invoicing share holds even excluding these countries though the standard errors are larger.
This leads into the discussion of more general concerns with using aggregate import price index
data. Firstly, most of these indices are unit value indices that tend to be very noisy and generate
22

Given the highly stable nature of currency invoicing shares this is a less likely concern for other countries that
did not experience a dramatic change in their currency regimes such as from joining a monetary union.
23
This may explain the high estimate for Germany.

22

imprecise pass-through estimates. A second concern is that they include prices of goods traded
intra-firm and these transfer prices may be less allocative and consequently less interesting.24
Thirdly, a few goods with long durations of price stickiness may bias the pass-through estimates
even eight quarters out. Lastly, the evidence so far is cross-sectional, namely countries with a
higher share of imports invoiced in their home currency have lower pass-through at all horizons.
It is important to know if this holds even within country, that is, is it the case that within country
there is greater pass-through into prices of goods invoiced in a foreign currency as compared to
those invoiced in home currency. To address these concerns I turn to evidence from detailed micro
price data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the next section.

2.1

Detailed Evidence from U.S. Imports

The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys a representative sample of U.S. firms to collect detailed
information on the prices of goods imported and exported. Alongside reporting the price of the
good, firms report the currency of denomination of the transaction. I use monthly data for the
twenty year period from 1994.M1-2014.M6 to examine the impact of currency denomination on
pass-through into U.S. import prices. This evidence extends the findings in Gopinath et al. (2010)
using ten years of additional data. This data while limited to the U.S. has several advantages
over the aggregate indices. Firstly, it reports on whether the transaction is arms-length or intrafirm. For all of the analysis in this section I will restrict the sample to arms-length transactions.
Secondly, one can estimate pass-through conditional on prices changing so this takes care of the
problem of long duration sticky prices impacting estimates of aggregate pass-through over long
horizons.25
Over 93% of all imports into the U.S. are invoiced in dollars. However there are a few countries
like Germany for which this fraction is significantly lower. Table 2.1 reports the fraction of imports
in the BLS sample invoiced in a currency that is not the dollar (non-dollar currency) by country
of origin. For each country the non-dollar currency is their home currency, that is for Germany it
24

Neiman (2010) contrasts the behavior of intra-firm and arms-length transaction prices for U.S. imports and
documents that the former are characterized by less stickiness, less synchronization, and greater exchange rate
passthrough.
25
In addition because there is detailed information on the country of origin of the imported good, the appropriate
bilateral exchange rate can be used unlike the case for the aggregate price index.

23

is euros starting 1999 and the deutsche mark before that. The countries are listed in a declining
order of the fraction of imports invoiced in non-dollars. Germany and Switzerland have over 30%
invoiced in non-dollars while the fraction for Italy, U.K. and Japan is around 20%.

Table 4: Currency Composition

2.1.1

Pass-Through for Arms-Length Transactions

With the currency of invoicing information I construct for each country of origin three separate
import price indices, all expressed in dollar values.26 For example, for Germany I construct one
index of the dollar value of all goods imported from Germany (“overall index”). Second I construct
an index of the dollar value of all imports from Germany that are priced in dollars (“dollar index”)
and a third for those German goods that are priced in non-dollars (“non-dollar index”). I then
estimate exchange rate pass-through in to each of these indices using the regression specification
equation 1 in Gopinath et al. (2010).

where m indexes the country of origin of imports, ∆p is the average monthly log price change
26

The analysis in this section is restricted to the countries listed in Table 2.1.

24

in dollars, ∆em,t−k is the log change in the bilateral nominal exchange rate between country m
and the U.S. (a positive value for ∆em,t−k implies a depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to
the currency of country m), π is the monthly foreign country inflation using the consumer price
index, and ∆y is average GDP growth in the U.S.; k is the number of lags which varies from 1 to
24. Since the data is monthly, I include up to 24 lags for the nominal exchange rate and foreign
inflation and 3 lags for GDP growth.
This is very close to the specification in equation 1 with the only difference being that here I
proxy the country of origin cost of production with consumer prices, as in Gopinath et al. (2010),
instead of producer prices, and I include current and two lags of U.S. GDP growth.
I estimate equation 4 for the overall index, the dollar index and the non-dollar index. Figure
12 plots the impulse responses from an exchange rate shock into the three indices where we pool
all the countries. The thick grey dashed line depicts the impulse response using the overall index.
The pass-through is 22% in the short-run and then increases gradually to 35% by the 24 month
horizon.
The thick solid black line and the thick dash-and-dots line plot the impulse response into the
dollar index and non-dollar index respectively. The thin dashed lines plot the 95% confidence
interval bands around the point estimates. In the short-run there is a large divergence in the
pass-through for goods priced in dollars versus non-dollars. It is close to 0% for goods priced in
dollars and 100% for good priced in non-dollars. This is to be expected when prices are sticky in
their currency of denomination and when the selection effect of which firm changes prices is small.
What is striking though is that the difference in the pass-through rates remains large even 24
months out. The pass-through into the dollar index increases from 0.3% to 20% at the 24 month
horizon. The pass-through into the non-dollar index on the other hand starts at 100% and stays
close to that value even 24 months out. This difference is also highly significant at all horizons.
This confirms the hypothesis that the reason countries with a large import share denominated in
foreign currency have high pass-through even two years out is because there is a large difference
in pass-through between goods priced in home versus foreign currency at both short and long
horizons. It is useful to compare Figure 12 with Figure 1 in the introduction. It highlights that
even for the U.S., goods that it imports that are priced in a foreign currency have the same high
25

Figure 12: Aggregate ERPT by Currency
In Figure 13 I present the same impulse responses as in Figure 12 but by country of origin of
imports. The same striking difference in pass-through between goods priced in dollars and in nondollars is observed at the country level. Pass-through into dollar prices of goods imported from
Germany that are dollar invoiced is 6% in the short-run and increases gradually up to 16% in the
long-run. On the other hand goods invoiced in euros (deutsch mark pre-1999) have a pass-through
of close to 100% at all horizons. In other words the same euro-dollar exchange rate movement is
associated with very different pass-through rates into export prices from Germany. This difference
is statistically significant for all countries with the exception of Canada where the estimates are
noisy.27

2.2

Pass-through Conditional on a Price Change

IPS Definition 2c: Border prices, in whatever currency they are set in, respond
partially to exchange rate shocks even conditional on a price change.
27

This can arise because of the Canadian dollar being a commodity currency where by changes in commodity
prices impact the value of the Canadian dollar.

The evidence presented in Section 2.1.1 includes constant price spells associated with price
stickiness (in the currency of invoicing). In this section I condition the pass-through estimates
on prices that actually change. Figure 14 taken from Gopinath and Itskhoki (2010b) plots a
hypothetical path for the price of an imported good pit and a path for the nominal exchange rate
et against time. The points of time when prices adjust are also marked on the plot. Consider the
price change in period tLL by the amount ∆p = ptLL − pt3 . This price change responds to the
cumulative change in the (log) exchange rate since the last time prices were adjusted. To measure
the sensitivity of this response and how it differs across goods priced in dollar and non-dollars I
estimate the following conditional pass-through regression.

∆pin,t = [βD · Di + βN D · (1 − Di )] ∆c ein,t + γXin,t + εin,t .

∆pin,t is the the change in the log price (in dollars) of the good imported in country n from country
i, where the sample is restricted to those observations that have a non-zero price change in their
currency of pricing. Di is a dummy that takes the value of one if the good is priced in dollars and
zero if priced in non-dollars. ∆c ein,t is the cumulative change in the bilateral nominal exchange
rate over the duration for which the previous price was in effect. Xin,t controls for the cumulative
change in the (log) foreign consumer price level, the (log) U.S. consumer price level, the (log) of
U.S. real GDP and includes fixed effects for every BLS defined primary strata (mostly 2-4 digit
harmonized codes) and country pair (and standard errors are clustered at this level).

I report in Table 5 estimates from the conditional pass-through regressions for U.S. import
prices by country of origin of goods. Columns (1) and (3) report the pass-through conditional on a
price change of dollar invoiced and non-dollar invoiced goods respectively. The difference between
the estimates and the statistical significance of the difference (the t-statistic) are reported in
columns (5) and (6) respectively. The difference in pass-throughs are large and highly significant.
For all countries the pass-through is 26% for goods priced in dollars while it is 85% for goods
priced in non-dollars. This pronounced difference is evident for imports from individual countries.
In the case of Germany, the conditional pass-through is 32% for goods prices in dollars and 85% for
goods priced in non-dollars. For ten of the twelve countries the difference is statistically significant
at at least the 5% level.
This far I have not distinguished goods by sectoral characteristics. As I show below the
stark contrast between pass-through of dollar and non-dollar invoiced goods persists even within
sub-samples of narrowly defined sectors. First, Table 6 repeats the analysis in Table 5 for the
sub-sample of differentiated goods as defined by Rauch (1999), goods for which firms have more
pricing power. These are goods that are neither traded on an exchange nor have a reference price.
Once again the differences are large. For all countries the conditional pass-through is 21% for
goods priced in dollars and 93% for goods priced in non-dollars. For all countries conditional
pass-through for non-dollar priced goods exceeds that for dollar priced goods and this difference
is statistically significant for eleven out of the twelve countries.
In Table 7 for all twenty sectors that have a mix of dollar and non-dollar pricers, the passthrough of non-dollar priced goods exceeds that of dollar priced goods and this difference is
significant at conventional levels for sixteen sectors.

I next examine differential pass-through within those ten digit classification codes that have a
mix of dollar and non-dollar invoiced goods. I find that dollar pricers have a pass-through of 27%,
non-dollar of 88% and the difference is highly statistically significant (t-stat of 15.30).
Lastly, I take the conditional pass-through measure further by estimating pass-through after
multiple rounds of price adjustment, specifically I regress the cumulative change in price over
the life of a good in the BLS sample and regress that on the cumulative change in the exchange
rate, in the foreign consumer price level, the U.S. consumer price level and U.S. GDP over the
same period. The results are reported in Table 8 and there continues to be a quantitatively and
statistically significant difference between pass-through of dollar and non-dollar goods.28
To summarize, there is strong evidence that currency invoicing patterns are good predictors for
pass-through even conditional on a price change. This is the case even within highly disaggregated
sectors.29

3

Consumer Price Inflation

The IP S focuses on import prices at-the-dock but has obvious implications for consumer prices.
Consumer prices combine traded (commodities) and non-traded goods (services) and because nontraded goods prices are less sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations as compared to traded goods
prices the pass-through into consumer prices is universally lower than pass-through into import
prices for every country. This is elucidated in detail in Burstein et al. (2005), Goldberg and
Campa (2010) and Burstein and Gopinath (2014), among other papers. Besides non-traded goods
the consumer price bundle includes traded goods that are sold only domestically (local goods) and
there is a distribution cost component (that includes retail mark-ups) that drives a wedge between
at-the-dock prices and retail prices of imported goods. Importantly there is less sensitivity of local
goods and distribution wedges to exchange rate changes as compared to import prices at-the-dock.
28

Gopinath et al. (2011) use BLS data to document that even during the Great Trade Collapse of 2008-2009
most of the adjustment was in quantities and not in prices.
29
As for price changes at the time of product substitutions Cavallo et al. (2014) provide evidence using a novel
dataset of online prices of identical goods sold by four large global retailers in dozens of countries. They document
that even at the time of product introduction there are large deviations in prices across countries that do not use
the same currency. In other words not measuring price changes at the time of product introduction/substitution
has little impact on the conclusions drawn from price changes during the life of the good.

35

Unlike empirical specifications for exchange rate pass-through into import prices, there is less
of a common methodology for estimating pass-through into consumer prices. One approach is to
use input-output tables to arrive at a measure of the import content of household consumption
and combine that with estimates of import pass-through. This approach captures the impulse
response of consumer prices to a change in import prices, while holding fixed any endogenous
responses, including that of monetary policy to inflation.30 I perform such a calculation for the
countries in our sample, adopting the methodology in Burstein et al. (2005), the details of which
are reported in the online Appendix ?? and the results are reported in Column (a) and (b) of
Table 9. The direct import content measures the fraction of final consumption expenditure on
imported goods. The total import content adds to the direct import content the value of imported
inputs used in the production of final consumption goods.31 Column (c) and (d) report estimates
for short and long-run CPI pass-through respectively by multiplying total import content with
import pass-through estimates from Section 2.
Pass-through into the CPI is expectedly lower than pass-through into the IPI given that import
content is only a fraction of the consumption bundle. The import content share in the consumer
bundle is on average 25% ranging from 10% to 41% with smaller economies having a larger import
share. The correlation between long-run pass-through into the CPI and long-run pass-through
into the IPI is 0.6, mainly indicating that variation in import content shares do not overturn
the conclusion that countries with high import pass-throughs experience high pass-through into
consumer prices. This is not surprising given that most small open economies (greater import
content in consumption) predominantly adopt dollar invoicing.
According to these estimates a 10% depreciation of the dollar relative to its trading partners
will raise cumulative CPI inflation two years out by 0.4-0.7 percentage points. On the other hand
a 10% depreciation of the Turkish (Mexican) lira (peso) will raise cumulative CPI inflation two
years out by 1.65-2.03 (1.38-1.59) percentage points. It is in this sense that U.S. inflation enjoys
greater insulation from exchange rate shocks as compared to other countries whose imports are
30

It also does not include any effects on prices of domestic producers that work through reducing or increasing
desired mark-ups.
31
Goldberg and Campa (2010) employ a more structural approach with specific demand, production and pricing
assumptions along with data from input-output tables to estimate the impact of imported final and intermediate
goods on consumer prices. Several of their estimates are comparable in magnitude to those reported in Table 9.

Table 9: Import Content and CPI Pass-Through
invoiced in a foreign currency.
A more structural approach would be to estimate an open economy version of a New Keynesian
Philips curve. There are however many challenges in doing this. Firstly, the appropriate specification relies heavily on assumptions related to the degree of international asset market completeness
and the nature of wage and price stickiness, among others. Secondly, reliable data on inflation
37

expectations do not exist for most countries in the sample.
Lastly, the sensitivity of estimates to specification and sample periods is a major concern with
this approach, as documented in the insightful and exhaustive analysis of Mavroeidis et al. (2014).
Table 5 of Mavroeidis et al. (2014) reports that the median estimate for the impact of the output
gap for quarterly U.S. inflation is 0.004, holding everything else constant including next period
inflation expectations and lagged inflation. This implies that a 10 percentage point increase in
the output gap raises the quarter on quarter inflation rate by 0.04 percentage points. The output
gap coefficient ranges from -0.068 at the fifth percentile to 0.135 at the ninety-fifth percentile. I
highlight these numbers to make the point that the sensitivity of CPI inflation to import prices
that according to Table 9 is 0.12 for the U.S. is near the upper end of estimates for the sensitivity
of inflation to the output gap. In addition, the volatility (standard deviation) of changes in the
(log) import price index (excluding petroleum) for the U.S. over the period 1985-Q1 to 2014-Q4
is 1.1%, which is of a comparable magnitude to the volatility in the unemployment gap (often
used as a measure of the output gap) of 1.43% over this same period. It is however lower than
the volatility of the output gap measured using CBO estimates of potential GDP, which stands at
2.25%.

Policy Implications

In this section I elaborate on the policy implications of the International Price System.
1. Inflation Stabilization: A good rule of thumb for a countries inflation sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations is the fraction of its imports invoiced in a foreign currency. The
greater the fraction of a country’s imports invoiced in a foreign currency the greater its
inflation sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations at both short and long horizons. The
depreciation (appreciation) of a country’s exchange rate from external shocks is not an inflationary (deflationary) concern for all countries. For the U.S. with 93% of its imports
invoiced in dollars the consequences are far more muted than for a country like India that
has 97% of its imports invoiced in foreign currency (mainly dollars). Conversely, monetary
policy is less effective in lowering (raising) inflation via a stronger (weaker) currency in the
38

U.S. as compared to India. In addition, given that long-run pass-through into prices is not
very different from short-run pass-through the direct impact of exchange rate fluctuations
will be front-loaded.

2. Export Competitiveness: When a country’s currency depreciates the expectation is that
it will stimulate demand for the country’s output as it lowers the relative price of its goods in
world markets. The IP S implies that this is unlikely to be the case for many countries that
rely on foreign currency invoicing for their exports. Consider the case of Japan discussed in
Section 2.1. Around 80% of its exports to the U.S. are priced in dollars and the pass-through
into dollar prices even conditional on a price change for these goods is 23%. Given the relative stability of the dollar price of U.S. imports from Japan even in the face of exchange
rate changes we should not expect to see large quantity responses of Japanese exports. On
the other hand it is more likely that exchange rate fluctuations show up in mark-up fluctuations such that Japanese exporters earn larger (smaller) profits following a yen depreciation
(appreciation). A similar argument applies to exports from most developing countries that
invoice their exports in dollars. Of course, higher profits following depreciations can feed
into increased exports via new product entry (extensive margin) but this is different from
the standard channel that arises from a country’s terms of trade depreciating. In the case
of the U.S. that has 97% of its exports priced in dollars the opposite is true. The relative
stability of dollar export prices generates a high pass-through into the local currency price
of the importing country.32 Consequently the scope for expenditure switching via exports is
greater, while mark-ups remain relatively stable.

3. Trade Balance: The previous two points imply that the reaction of the trade balance to
exchange rate fluctuations for countries whose imports and exports are invoiced in their
home currency (like the U.S.) is likely to be dominated by the export channel while for those
that rely on foreign invoicing should be dominated by the import channel.33
32

Gopinath et al. (2010) document that for U.S. exports even conditional on a price change pass-through into
local currency prices of goods that are priced in dollars is 84%, while pass-through for goods priced in the importing
country’s currency is 25%.
33
Goldberg and Tille (2006) also highlight this point. Gopinath and Neiman (2014) provide evidence for a

4. Monetary Policy Spillovers: The IP S has the potential to generate asymmetries in monetary policy spillovers. A monetary policy tightening in the U.S. that is associated with a
dollar appreciation generates inflation in countries that import primarily in dollar invoiced
prices and this may induce them to tighten monetary policy to address inflation concerns.
On the other hand monetary tightening in the periphery has a smaller impact on U.S. inflation through import prices given the dollar dominance of invoicing in U.S. imports. While it
has been discussed previously that dollar invoicing gives rise to such asymmetric effects34 it
was assumed to be relevant only for durations for when prices are sticky. The IP S implies
that this is true for even longer horizons.
What remains to be addressed are the implications of the IP S for optimal monetary policy,
particularly for more open economies. There exists an important literature on optimal
monetary policy under the assumptions of PCP and LCP. With PCP the optimal policy is
to target producer prices (Clarida et al. (2002)) while with LCP there is an argument for
targeting consumer prices (Engel (2011)). The world however looks closer to one of dollar
pricing and particularly of the kind where one quarter pass-through rates are close to passthrough rates even two years out. Optimal policy in this case will differ across countries
given the asymmetries in invoicing patterns.35

5. Internationalization of Currencies: The low sensitivity of international prices in their
currency of invoicing to exchange rate shocks suggests that countries can benefit from the
use of their currency as an invoicing currency in terms of inflation stability. China’s push
to internationalize the yuan can have this added benefit. However given the large inertia in
invoicing strategies this process can take a long time.

6. Special Drawing Rights (SDR): The relative stability of prices in their unit of account
suggests that if firms were instead to price in the IMF’s unit of account, SDRs, there would
significant decline in productivity in Argentina following a 70% collapse in imports during the large devaluation of
2000-2002.
34
Such as in Corsetti and Pesenti (2005) and Goldberg and Tille (2009a).

Devereux et al. (2007) explore the welfare impact of a dollar standard on the world economy when prices are
set one period in advance.

be greater symmetry in the impact of exchange rate shocks as compared to the current
asymmetry. Because the value of the SDR is based on the market value of a basket of
major currencies, namely the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, and pound sterling, fluctuations in
any individual major currency has a smaller impact on the value of the SDR and mutes
spillovers across countries. If the yuan is added to this basket, a proposal that is being
seriously considered, this has the potential to further mute the impact of any individual
currency. However, as will follow from the discussion in the next section, for an individual
firm to be tempted to price in SDRs it must be the case that a large number of other
exporters and importers also do so.

Theoretical Discussion: Prices and Currency

The goal of this section is to explain how the forces of globalization including global value chains
and global competition in product markets give rise to and sustain the IP S. To do so I first
describe the theoretical determinants of pass-through into import prices distinguishing between
flexible and sticky price environments. I then describe their implications for the choice of currency
in which to price/invoice goods that in turn corroborates the definition of the IP S in Section
2. This section relies extensively on a large literature on pass-through and currency choice as
surveyed in Burstein and Gopinath (2014).
To aid the discussion of determinants of pass-through I will use as a narrative tool the pricing
decision of a Japanese firm exporting to the U.S. For now I assume that the Japanese exporter is
risk-neutral. Suppose the yen depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar. It could be the outcome of
a monetary expansion in Japan or a monetary contraction in the U.S. or a risk premia shock to
foreign investors in Japanese bonds.

5.1

Flexible Prices

First consider the case where the Japanese firm sets prices flexibly and there are no lags between
production, delivery of products and receipt of payments. This is an environment where currency
serves a unit of account/invoicing role but is otherwise irrelevant. Because the problem is static
41

the profit maximizing Japanese firm can quote a price in dollars or instead in yen using the
spot exchange rate.36 This static problem is studied in the seminal works of Dornbusch (1987)
and Krugman (1987) and is the framework for numerous papers in the literature as surveyed in
Burstein and Gopinath (2014). I will assume without loss of generality that the invoicing currency
is the dollar. Profit maximizing prices can be expressed generically as a mark-up over marginal
costs. The pricing response of the Japanese firm then depends on two factors: the sensitivity of
its marginal costs expressed in dollars to the exchange rate shock and the sensitivity of its desired
mark-up to exchange rate shocks.
5.1.1

Marginal cost sensitivity

The marginal cost in dollars depends on prices of variable inputs that enter the production function
such as labor, rental capital, and intermediate inputs when converted to dollars and on firm
productivity.37 In addition if production is subject to decreasing returns to scale then the level
of production also impacts marginal costs. The sensitivity of the marginal cost to the exchange
rate shock will generally depend on the source of the shock. Suppose the yen depreciation follows
from a monetary expansion in Japan then it is possible that wages in yen rise alongside the yen
depreciation and consequently the sensitivity of the wage bill in dollars is low. The empirical
evidence however is more supportive of a disconnect between local currency (yen) wages and
exchange rates especially at frequencies studied in the pass-through literature.38 Accordingly,
the yen depreciation is associated with an almost proportionate decline in wages denominated in
dollars. The reduced sensitivity of the marginal cost to the exchange rate change can however arise
from the use of imported intermediate inputs in production. If these imported inputs are priced
in dollars and these dollar prices are insensitive to the exchange rate change then only the fraction
of costs that rely on domestic inputs will react to the exchange rate shock. The incentive to lower
dollar prices following the yen depreciation, and therefore the pass-through into dollar prices, then
depends on the Japanese firms reliance on imported inputs in its production. The fact that most
exporters are also importers is now well documented in the literature by Bernard et al. (2009),
36

For the same reason the solution does not depend on whether the firm is maximizing yen profits or dollar
profits.
37
These prices can include wedges that arise from taxes or from financing frictions.
38
See the literature following the seminal observation of Meese and Rogoff (1983).

42

Kugler and Verhoogen (2009), Manova and Zhang (2009) among others. This is also reflected
in the fact that value added exports are significantly lower than gross exports, particularly for
manufacturing, as documented in the works of Johnson (2014) Johnson and Noguera (2012). Amiti
et al. (2014) employ data on Belgian firms to show that exporters that import more do indeed
pass-through a smaller fraction of exchange rate shocks into their export prices (denominated in
the destination currency).
Lastly, production can be subject to decreasing returns to scale because of the fixed nature
of capital in the short-run and other forms of capacity constraints. In this case if the Japanese
firm reduces the dollar price and consequently raises the demand it faces, as it produces more its
marginal cost increases. This channel dampens the sensitivity of dollar marginal costs to exchange
rate shocks thus reducing desired pass-through. This channel may be more important for firms in
developing countries that face greater infrastructure constraints.

5.1.2

Mark-up Sensitivity

The mark-up a firm charges depends on the elasticity of the demand it faces and consequently the
sensitivity of the mark-up to the exchange rate shock depends on the sensitivity of the elasticity
of demand to the shock. A widely used demand form is the Dixit-Stigliz preferences which when
combined with monopolistic competition gives rise to constant mark-ups. In this case pass-through
is equal to the sensitivity of dollar marginal costs. If dollar marginal costs decline one to one in
response to a yen depreciation then dollar prices are also reduced one to one and pass-through is a
hundred percent. However, the importance of variable mark-ups in determining pass-through was
recognized early on by Dornbusch (1987) and Krugman (1987) who studied oligopolies and monopolies. Atkeson and Burstein (2008) expand on this framework allowing for multiple industries
and trade costs.
The Japanese firm selling to the U.S. market faces competition from U.S. producers and other
exporters to the U.S. market. When firms are not infinitesimal the elasticity of demand they face
varies with their market share. By lowering its dollar price the firm is able to gain market share but
at the expense of lower mark-ups. A profit maximizing firm optimizes this trade-off. The extent
to which it chooses to lower prices versus raising mark-ups depends on the extent of strategic
43

complementarities in pricing. When complementarities are high firm profits are maximized when
the firm keeps its prices relative to its competitors prices stable. As Atkeson and Burstein (2008)
show for a given cross-sector elasticity of demand the higher the elasticity of substitution across
products within a sector the greater the absorption in mark-ups and consequently the lower is
desired pass-through.39
The empirical evidence on variable mark-ups40 dates back to Knetter (1989), Knetter (1993)
and the survey article by Goldberg and Knetter (1997) who use aggregate export prices to multiple
destinations from the same country to document that the law of one price fails across these
destinations. The test design assumes that the costs of producing the good is independent of the
destination to which it is sold. Consequently any evidence of the failure of the law of one price
for goods originating in the same country must be evidence of variable mark-ups. Fitzgerald and
Haller (2013) use Irish plant level data to provide evidence of pricing-to-market. Burstein and
Jaimovich (2008) present evidence using data for the U.S. and Canada. Berman et al. (2012)
present evidence of variable mark-ups tied to firm productivity using data for French firms.
To summarize, in the flexible price environment, pass-through into U.S. import prices of goods
originating in Japan depends, firstly, on the sensitivity of Japanese firms marginal costs to the
exchange rate shock, which in turn depends importantly on the reliance of its production structure
on imported inputs and the sensitivity of those input costs (in dollar terms) to the exchange rate
shock. Second, it depends on the impact of the shock on Japan’s competitors, which include U.S.
producers and exporters from other countries whose products compete with Japanese firms. In
the presence of strategic complementarities in pricing Japanese firms would want to keep their
prices relative to their competitors prices stable and this in turn lowers pass-through.

5.2

Sticky Prices

The existence of infrequent price adjustments has long been acknowledged in the literature. Terminology such as Producer Currency Pricing (PCP) to denote pricing in the exporters/origination
39

As the firm raises prices it lowers its market share and this raises the elasticity of demand it faces reducing
desired mark-ups.
40
I use variable mark-ups and pricing to market interchangeably. Technically to obtain pricing-to-market one
requires not just a source for variable mark-ups but also some form of market segmentation such as trade costs
(transportation costs, tariffs etc). Since it is safe to assume that such costs exist I treat the two terms as the same.

44

currency and Local Currency Pricing (LCP) to denote pricing in the importers/destination currency is standard in Keynesian open economy models. When prices are sticky the currency of
denomination/invoicing has a large impact on pass-through.41 If the Japanese firm sets prices
that are sticky in U.S. dollars then for the duration when prices are unchanged pass-through in
dollar prices is zero. On the other hand if prices are sticky in yen pass-through is a hundred
percent. The duration of price stickiness and the currency of invoicing will therefore have a large
impact on pass-through.42
When it is costly to adjust prices expectations of the future path of exchange rates enter pricing
decisions. Because freely floating nominal exchange rates have been shown to behave like random
walks in the time series firms should respond to these shocks as if they are permanent. However
in reality it may be the case that firms expect exchange rate shocks to be transitory in which case
their incentive to change prices in the currency of invoicing is limited as the exchange rate may
revert during the time spell when the new price is in effect. This then generates differences in
pass-through between LCP and PCP even conditional on prices having changed.
With the proliferation of micro datasets on prices there is now a large empirical literature
surveyed in Klenow and Malin (2010) that documents considerable price stickiness especially for
wholesale/producer prices. Gopinath and Rigobon (2008) and Gopinath and Itskhoki (2010a)
present evidence of price stickiness of actual traded goods using import and export prices for
the U.S. They document that the weighted median price duration in the currency of pricing for
arms-length transactions is 10.6 (12.8) months for imports (exports). Fitzgerald and Haller (2013)
report estimates of 6.25 months for Irish exports. Friberg and Wilander (2008) use survey data for
Swedish firms and report estimates of one year for list prices. Sticky price concerns in international
trade are therefore well founded.
41

Prices in a specified currency are contracted for a period of time that may be deterministic (Taylor) or stochastic
(Calvo, Menu-Cost).
42
In theory the impact of price rigidity on aggregate pass-through depends on how firms get selected into changing
prices. In a Calvo sticky price environment where firms are randomly assigned the option to change prices aggregate
pass-through rates are closely tied to the degree of price stickiness. On the other hand, if firms optimally decide
when to change prices, as in menu cost models, aggregate passthrough can be disconnected from price stickiness as
originally elucidated by Caplin and Spulber (1987).

45

5.3

Currency of Invoicing

The vast majority of papers in the Keynesian open economy macro literature assumes exogenous
currency invoicing, typically either PCP or LCP. Milton Friedman’s advocacy for flexible exchange
rates rests on the assumption that firms set prices in their own currency; that is, they practice
PCP.43 This exogeneity assumption arises to an important extent from the desire to maintain
tractability in general equilibrium models. The incorporation of endogenous currency choice with
price stickiness requires departures from more tractable demand and cost structures and typically
involves multiple equilibria. However important progress has been made in connecting the sticky
price environment and flexible price determinants in the works of Giovannini (1988), Donnenfeld
and Zilcha (1991), Friberg (1998), Engel (2006), Devereux et al. (2004), Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2005), Gopinath et al. (2010), Goldberg and Tille (2008), Goldberg and Tille (2009b) among
others. In this section I describe the implications of endogenous currency choice in a world with
price stickiness. This then corroborates the description of the International Price System from a
theoretical perspective.
When discussing currency choice I will use the currency of invoicing and currency of pricing
terminology interchangeably. While the currency of invoice does not necessarily have to be the
same as the currency of pricing, in practice they are. The best evidence is provided by Friberg
and Wilander (2008) who use survey data for a sample of Swedish exporters and report that for
the overwhelming share of exports the price, invoice and settlement are denominated in the same
currency.

5.3.1

Desired Pass-Through

Initially I will continue to assume that there are no lags between production, delivery of products
and receipt of payments and that the firm is risk-neutral. I will discuss the implications of relaxing
these assumptions later in this section.
Consider the currency invoicing decision of the Japanese firm exporting to the U.S. market.
43

The seminal contributions of Svensson and van Wijnbergen (1989) and Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) embed this
assumption as one of the foundations of the modern Keynesian open economy macro literature. However, the
relative stability of local currency prices to exchange rate changes motivated important work using the alternative
assumption of LCP, as in Devereux and Engel (2003).

46

The constraint here is the inability to adjust prices costlessly. When the firm chooses its price and
the currency of pricing it takes into account the implications for its profits of its choices during
the periods when the price will be in effect. If the firm chooses to price in dollars it will attain an
unconditional pass-through of 0% into dollar prices for the duration when prices are unchanged.
On the other hand if it chooses to price in yen the pass-through into dollar prices will be 100%
during this period.
The choice of invoicing currency then depends on what its unconditional desired pass-through
is, that is what its pass-through would have been if it could change prices flexibly. This choice
therefore depends crucially on the flexible price determinants of pass-through.44 Suppose its
desired pass-through into dollars is low, say 10%, then dollar invoicing by implying a pass-through
of 0% during the period of price rigidity helps the firm better mimic its desired pass-through,
rather than yen invoicing that generates a pass-through of 100%. If on the other hand its desired
pass-through into dollars is high, say 90% it will be optimal to choose yen invoicing.
Currency choice is then closely linked to the discussion in Section 5.1. It depends on the
sensitivity of its marginal costs and desired mark-up to exchange rate movements. Importantly, in
an environment with price stickiness, this sensitivity depends on the currency of invoicing choice
of other exporters.
Consider the marginal cost sensitivity channel. If the dollar is the predominant currency of
invoicing then the Japanese firms imported inputs are priced in dollars.45 This implies that its
marginal costs in dollars are less sensitive to exchange rate movements. Consequently the Japanese
firm has low desired pass-through into dollar prices and therefore will choose to price in dollars.
A similar argument applies to the mark-up channel. As described previously desired sensitivity
of mark-ups depends on the extent of strategic complementarities in pricing. If the Japanese
firm faces competition in the U.S. market from other producers, both domestic and foreign, who
set prices in dollars then profit maximization requires the firm keep its price stable relative to
its competitors. During the period when the price is sticky this can be attained by invoicing
in dollars, so that yen-dollar exchange rate movements do not impact its relative price. More
44

Desired pass-through is different from flexible price pass-through because it measures the extent of pass-through
of a firm if it can change prices in an environment where other firms prices may be sticky.
45
What really matters in the sensitivity of the dollar inputs costs to the exchange rate movements.

47

broadly if world trade markets are characterized by a predominance of dollar invoicing then that
incentivizes any entrant exporter into also choosing dollar invoicing.
As is evident there is the possibility of multiple equilibria in currency invoicing. In the absence
of a concerted effort by a significant fraction of exporters to switch the currency of invoicing
the dollar dominance is reinforced with each additional entrant. The introduction of the euro is
arguably one such coordinating shock to the currency of invoicing.
Now consider alternative explanations for currency of invoicing, some of which require relaxing
the assumptions made at the start of this section.

5.3.2

Fixed costs in setting prices

International trade is dominated by large firms that export to multiple destinations. Destination
specific pricing can be costly in terms of management hours, for instance in determining the
elasticity of demand it faces in a particular market and the competitors it faces. If the destination
market is large in the portfolio of the exporting firm it can be worthwhile incurring the cost.
However if the destination market is small the firm may choose to offer the same price, in the
same currency, as what it charges its larger customers. This can generate bunching in pricing and
invoicing decisions across destinations.

5.3.3

Hedging

I emphasize that hedging (using forward contracts) does not make the currency invoicing decision
in the presence of price stickiness irrelevant. The discussion in Section 5.3.1 from the perspective
of a risk-neutral investor highlights that expected profits differ across currency invoicing regimes
and accordingly hedging does not suffice to generate equivalence across regimes.
Risk averse exporters are however known to use currency hedging, such as forward currency
contracts, to reduce volatility in profits arising from exchange rate uncertainty when pricing in a
currency not their own. If the Japanese firm chooses to price in dollars and is risk-averse it can
fully hedge its exchange rate exposure by selling forward the predetermined dollar revenue using
the forward rate. If the forward equals the expected spot and the transaction is costless then this

48

is without loss of expected profits.46 If the Japanese firm chooses to price in a third currency,
hedging is less straightforward. This is because there is uncertainty in the revenue earned in the
third currency and consequently there is uncertainty in the amount that is to be hedged.
In Section 5.3.1 the exporting firm chooses a price that is contracted for a length of time while
quantity is left to be determined by the buyer given the price and is not contracted on. That is
quantities can fluctuate in response to shocks during the duration when prices are sticky.47 Often
trade contracts take the form of pre-specified prices and quantities. In this case pricing in the
exporters currency will eliminate profit risk to the exporter without the need to hedge. A similar
argument applies for when there are lags between production and delivery and receipt of payment
and hedging is costly.

5.3.4

Bargaining

In the preceding discussion I described the problem through the lens of exporters unilaterally
choosing the optimal price and invoicing currency so as to maximize profits. In reality these
decisions are the outcome of a negotiation process between the exporter and importer and the
results are the outcome of a bargaining process. Goldberg and Tille (2013) explicitly consider such
a bargaining process, specifically Nash bargaining, in an environment where there are risk-averse
importers and exporters and lags between when contracts are written and actual transactions
take place giving rise to the need to allocate exchange rate risk. A feature of the bargaining
outcome Goldberg and Tille (2013) highlight is that when the importer is large there should be
more invoicing in the importer’s currency.

5.3.5

Financial market development

It is often suggested that currency invoicing choices in trade transactions are related to the depth
of financial markets in currencies, particularly in the provision of trade credit. That is the dollar
is used in trade transactions because of extremely liquid dollar financial markets and trade credit
denominated in dollars. While this is plausible there is very little formal analysis of this linkage.
46

See Friberg (1998) for a fuller discussion.
Gopinath and Rigobon (2008) employ confidential BLS micro data to document that even when quantities are
contracted on, some flexibility is allowed along side the price being completely rigid.
47

49

5.3.6

General Equilibrium

Most of the analysis on currency choice is carried out in partial equilibrium. Desired pass-through
is the ratio of the covariance of the desired flexible price of the exporting firm (in the importers
currency) with the exchange rate and the variance of the exchange rate. In general equilibrium
both the covariance and variance depend on the fundamental shocks to the economy. Under specific
assumptions Devereux et al. (2004) show that firms are less likely to invoice in the currency of a
country with a volatile monetary policy that raises the variance of the exchange rate.
Summary: What does all of this imply for the sensitivity of a country’s inflation to exchange
rate shocks? Firstly, the close relation between desired pass-through and currency of invoicing
implies that there should be a close link between short-run pass-through, when many goods prices
are yet to change, and long-run pass-through into prices in any given currency. Consequently,
countries with high (low) short-run sensitivity of their inflation to exchange rate shocks will have
high (low) long-run sensitivity. Secondly, the invoicing patterns of a country’s import bundle are
good predictors of inflation sensitivity. Inflation sensitivity is greater the larger the fraction of a
country’s imports priced in a foreign currency, that is not in its own currency. Lastly, forces such
as strategic complementarities in pricing and network effects through trade in intermediate inputs
should give rise to the emergence of only a few currencies dominating invoicing in world trade
and these invoicing patterns will change infrequently.48 This is consistent with all the evidence
reported in Section 2. This section also highlights that the relevant pass-through estimate (for
currency choice) is an unconditional pass-through from exchange rates to prices. Because of
this the standard omitted variable concerns that arise in pass-through regressions owing to the
endogeneity of exchange rates do not apply here.

5.4

Evidence on factors influencing Currency Choice

The empirical evidence on what factors determine currency choice is rather limited for two reasons:
Firstly, disaggregated firm level data on invoicing currency and prices for importers and exporters
is hard to come by. Secondly, even with appropriate data it can be difficult to isolate the forces
48

A complementary channel that gives rise to dominant currencies are transaction costs in exchanging currencies
as in Rey (2001) and Devereux and Shi (2008).

50

described in Section 5.3 as there is no simple linear relation between variables such as strategic
complementarity in pricing, marginal cost sensitivity, macroeconomic risk and currency choice.
What is clear though is that given that international trade is dominated by at most two currencies,
the dollar and the euro, the dominant explanatory factors have to be common across countries.
That is, it cannot be about idiosyncratic features of transactions between individual importers
and exporters.
Here I briefly summarize existing evidence. Several papers point to evidence of the strategic
complementarity in pricing channel, that is when firms export goods that are close substitutes
they are likely to invoice in a common currency. Gopinath et al. (2010) use BLS import price
data to document that dollar pricing is more common in sectors classified as producing more
homogenous goods as compared to differentiated goods (following the Rauch (1999) classification).
For instance sectors such as ‘Animal or Vegetable Fats and Oils’, ‘Wood and articles of Wood’ and
‘Mineral Products’ are dominated by dollar pricers. On the other hand there is a greater share
of non-dollar pricers in the ‘Footwear’, ‘Textiles and textile articles’, ‘Machinery and mechanical
appliances’ sectors.49 Goldberg and Tille (2008) find a similar result when they examine aggregate
invoicing data for 24 countries, that is more homogenous goods are priced everywhere in a common
currency, dollars, and this is less true for differentiated goods. Ito et al. (2012) survey Japanese
exporters who report using yen invoicing when they export highly differentiated products or when
their product has a dominant share in world markets.
Chung (2014) provides evidence for the imported intermediate inputs channel using UK trade
transaction data with non-EU countries. She finds that a 1% decrease in the share of imported
inputs priced in sterling decreases the probability that UK exporters invoice in sterling by about
18%. Goldberg and Tille (2009b) provide evidence to support a prediction of the bargaining
model namely that the Canadian dollar is used more extensively for larger import transactions
into Canada. This is also consistent with fixed costs in currency invoicing decisions. Devereux
et al. (2015) provide evidence that the market shares of both exporting and importing firms play
a significant role in determining exchange rate pass-through and the currency of invoicing.
Besides these sector and transaction level considerations it is documented that macroeconomic
49

Gopinath et al. (2010) also document that dollar prices change more frequently than non-dollar prices.

51

variables such as exchange rate volatility associated with volatile macroeconomic shocks impact
currency invoicing. This more generally lines up with the fact that developing countries rely more
heavily on third currency dollar invoicing as compared to developed countries as illustrated in
Figure 4.

6

Conclusions

There is considerable variation in the sensitivity of a country’s imported inflation to exchange rate
shocks at horizons of up to two years. In this paper I demonstrate that one factor, the share of its
imports invoiced in a foreign currency, plays a significant role in generating this variation. This has
implications for a country’s inflation insularity to exchange rate shocks and has predictions for the
margins of adjustment of a country’s trade balance to exchange rate fluctuations. It provides an
additional argument for why countries can benefit from the internationalization of their currency,
while at the same time highlighting the limits to its success given existing network effects.
There is clearly a lot more to be understood both on the empirical and theoretical front. Several
of the policy implications spelt out in Section 4 need to be confronted with additional empirical
evidence. This will require more systematic data collection efforts for import and export prices,
quantities, and currency invoicing patterns by countries. Many countries simply lack usable import
and export price index data. At present only a few programs like the International Price Program
at the BLS in the U.S. construct actual price indices, while most countries rely on unit value
indices. The pass-through estimates using aggregate unit value indices can be very noisy. On the
theoretical front besides understanding the implications of the IP S for optimal monetary policy
we also need a better understanding of the links between dollars prominence in asset markets and
that in good markets. How does a country’s reserve currency status benefit its invoicing status or
the other way round?
Lastly, there can be important non-price methods of passing through exchange rate shocks that
do not get captured in prices. For instance there can be lump-sum compensation for exchange
rate changes despite reported prices being unchanged. The consequences of this for inflation and
international trade need further investigation.
