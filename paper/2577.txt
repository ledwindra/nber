On the Consistency of Short-run and Long-run
Exchange Rate Expectations

ABSTRACT

This paper examines whether short-term exchange rate expectations move "too

much" by comparing them with long-term expectations. We develop a set of
nonlinear restrictions linking expectations at different forecast horizons. The
restrictions impose consistency,

a

property weaker than rationality. We use ex-

change rate survey data to measure expectations and then test whether consis-

tency holds. The data show that a current, positive exchange rate shock leads
agents to expect a higher long-run future spot rate when iterating forward their

short-terni expectations titan when thinking directly about the long run. In this
sense short-horizon expectations may overreact to current exchange rate changes.

1. Introduction
Much as the value of the dollar has fluctuated during the 1980s, so too has the view
that exchange rate determination should be left entirely to an unrestricted foreign exchange

market. Only a decade ago, economists were nearly unanimous in endorsing perfectly
flexible exchange rates. In addition to Milton Friedman's (1953) persuasive argument that

floating rates provided the least costly means of international adjustment, an avalanche of
empirical work seemed to reaffirm economists' belief in free markets; empirical tests of spot

and forward market efficiency were unable to reject, and a variety of models using sensible

fundamentals appeared to explain important aspects of exchange rate behavior. But by the
iuid-1980s much had changed: simple efficiency tests had become powerful enough to reject

regularly,' and researchers turned pessimistic in their search for models that could explain

a positive fraction of exchange rate changes on the basis of fundamentals. The bleak
situation was underscored by Meese and Rogoff's (1983) demonstration that a random
walk, which cannot explain any positive portion of exchange rate changes, outperformed
every model against which it was pitted.2
ratj,raUy, forward market efficiency would he rejected ai a oneer[Ileuce of pittti'r a I jjnr.varying exchange risk premium,
or a failure of rational expectations.

More recently, some economists have begun to revive older Keynesian views that
expectations (and to some extent the currency values themselves) may sometimes be driven

by animal spirits, and that the behavior of expectations may he responsible for many of
the disappointments with floating rates.3 Short-term exchange rate expectations are often

thought to fall prey to such forces. Nurkse (1944) for instance, is cited frequently for his
fear that short-term expectations were subject to bandwagon effects: a contemporaneous
depreciation in the spot exchange rate tends by itself to nake speculators expect additional

depreciation, potentially driving the spot rate further away front equilibrium.
Because expectations are unobservable, there is not much direct evidence on the way
expectations behave. What little evidence we have, however, would appear at first glance to

support Nurkse's suspicion. Frankel and R-oot (1987h, 1988) use survey data on exchange

rate expectations to estimate models of expectations formation and find that shorterterm expectations appear to exhibit the bandwagon effects described by Nurkse, while
longer-term expectations do not. However, if agents form their expectations rationally,
it is not clear why the mere presence of bandw3gon expectations should be a source of

concern. If, for example, the stochastic process generating the exchange rate displays
positive serial correlation over short horizons, bandwagon expectations may rationally and

passively reflect the behavior of the spot rate.

As one might expect, there is even less evidence that bandwagon expectations fail

to be rational over short horizons. Frankel and Froot test, but are not able to reject,
the hypothesis that bandwagon predictions are optimal if agents are limited to current
and past exchange rate changes when forecasting future changes. Indeed, there is other
evidence that seems to support independently the rationality (or near rationality) of short-

term bandwagon expectations. Huizinga (1986) and Kaminski (1987) both find that the

stochastic process governing realized exchange rate changes displays positive serial cor-

relation over short horizons.4 This finding, coupled with the sheer volatility of the spot

rate, suggests that tests of rationality are likely to have the problem of low power in
distinguishing among nearby alternatives.5

A second problem in tests of rationality in the foreign exchange market, besides low
power, is that the usual confidence intervals may not be reliable- Infrequent but important

events can create "peso problems" which make the distribution of the regression residuals
far from normal, and therefore produce misleading inferences in small samples. Indeed, the

notion of peso problems has become so accepted that many recent empirical studies now

conclude with partial disclaimers about the reliability of their findings in the presence of
such problems-0 In much the sante way, inference may be distorted through the presence

of rational stochastic bubbles,1 unless the bubbles form and pop very frequently in the

sample.8 In sum, the problems both of low power and nonnormal residuals in small
samples tend to limit severely the force of any empirical evidence on the rationality of
short-term expectationsIn this paper we use a different and potentially more reliable metric to judge whether

short-term expectations move too much: long-term expectations. That is, we test whether
agents' expectations at different forecast horizons lead to equivalent predictions of the level

of the exchange rate far into the future, a property that we call consistency. Short-term
expectations may be said to be inconsistent relative to long-term expectations if a positive

shock to the exchange rate leads agents to expect a higher long-run future spot rate when
iterating forward their short-term expectations than when thinking directly about the long

Clearly, consistency is a necessary condition if expectations are to be rational. But

consistency is weaker than rationality, since it does not require that the expectations
process match the stochastic process generating the actual exchange rate. In addition,
tests of consistency will be free of many of the statistical problems (such as those created

by stochastic bubbles and peso problems) that plague tests of rationality. A failure of
short-term expectations to be consistent would imply that even the agents themselves are
not willing to live with the long-run implications of their own short-run forecasts.

Naturally, if we are to examine the behavior of expectations independently of the

behavior of the actual spot process, we must rely on a measure of the expected future

spot rate other than the future realization. Toward this end, we use data from three
different surveys of exchange rate expectations. Each of the surveys simultaneously elicits

expectations at several forecast horizons, allowing us to test whether the responses in
each survey are consistent. In addition, the three surveys include a wide variety of forecast
horizons, ranging from one week to one year. We can therefore gain a sense for whether any

inconsistency in the data pervades the term structure of agents' expectations, or whether
it is confined to very short forecast horizons.
To preview our results, the statistical evidence presented below indicates that expectations do exhibit inconsistencies, although these inconsistencies appear less severe when
comparing very short forecast horizons, such as one week and one month. By contrast, both

three- and six-month expectations appear to be very significantly inconsistent with expec-

tations at the one-year horizon. However, in terms of economic (rather than statistical)
significance the data display a striking similarity across all forecast horizons and curren-

cies: relative to longer-term expectations, shorter-term expectations invariably overreact
to an exchange rate shock.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 defines the property of
consistency and develops the cross-equation restrictions needed to test it. The results of
our tests are presented in section 3. Section 4 concludes.

2. Consistency
Let ek,,+k denote the k-period change between t + k and £ in the log of the spot

rate expressed in terms of dollars per unit of foreign currency. We denote the market's
expectation at time £ of the log percentage change over the same period by mkg+k. As in a
vector-autoregressive model, we assume that one-period ahead expectations are formed as

a linear combination of current and lagged spot rate changes, aj(L)ej ,, plus other residual
factors that are conditionally independent of current and past exchange rate changes:9

= 7i + aj(L)ei,, + it1,,

(1)

where

E(pi,Iejt . . . e1,_p) = 0,

(2)

L is the lag operator, and P is the order of the autoregression.10 The assumption that /2j,
is strictly orthogonal to current and past exchange rate changes is a strong one, although
it is the usual assumption made when estimating vector autoregressions. Ironically, we are

on relatively strong ground in this particular case: the failure of both past exchange rate
changes and fundamentals11 to predict a positive portion of the current change indicates
that exchange rate changes are serially uncorrelated as well as uncorrelated with current

and lagged fundamentals. The lack of serial correlation suggests that our estimates will
be robust to ntisspeciflcation of P, while the inability of economic fundamentals to explain

exchange rate changes suggests that our estimates are robust to the specification and
inclusion of these other factors.

Similar to equation (1), the market's expectation of depreciation over the subsequent
k periods is given by:

in equations (2) and (4), respectively, do not

We can express the upcoming spot rate change in terms of the same linear combination

of current and past changes as equation (1), plus a new residual:

is

the one-period prediction error made by the

market. To move backwards from equation (5) to (1) we define the operator, E7', which

yields the expectation over the market's subjective time-i conditional density function.
The market's prediction of the upcoming spot rate change can then be expressed:

Er(ei,+i)

= 'yj + a1(L)e1, + Er(El,+!),

(6)

where by construction, Er(ei,,÷j) = mi,,+i and Er(€1.,+1) =
Note that if expectations are rational in the sense of Muth, then the market's condi-

tional density function is equal to the objective conditional density function (conditioning

on all information available at time t), .Er(.) = E,(.). In that case, equation (6) represents a standard vector-autoregressive model of exchange rate changes. Having made this

assumption, we could estimate consistently the expectational parameter vector, aj(L),
front equation (5) with ordinary least squares (OLS). However, ii the subjective and objective densities are not precisely equal, then estimation of equation (5) will not generally

produce consistent estimates of aj(L). In such a case it would not be appropriate to assuine that the objective conditional expectation of the prediction error is equal to zero,

= 0. Because we are interested in the particular linear combination

used in forming expectations, we attempt to estimate equation (6) directly. This procedure is more general than one which relies on equatbn (5), since it allows for, but does
6

not impose, the restriction that agents know the conditional density function of the actual

spot process.
In order to develop our test of consistency, we need to express the long-horizon fore-

casts in equation (3) in terms of the parameters from equation (1). To do this we first
rewrite equation (5) as a Ilrst-order autoregressive system:

Consistency will involve restrictions on the companion matrix, A.

By applying iteratively the subjective expectations operator to equation (7), it is
straightforward to write the market's expectation of the change in the spot-rate vector, x,

between periods t + j and I + j — 1:
i—I

f—i

= EA'I' + A1x1,1 + Er(A'c,+1_1)

(8)

i=O

= (Ip — A)(Jp — A)' + Ax1, +
Equation (8) shows how any expected future one-period change in the spot rate can be
expressed as a linear function of current and past exchange rate changes.
Next we use equation (8) to form the expected k-period change given in equation (3).

Note that the k-period expected change in the spot-rate vector from I + k to I is given by

=

Using this fact and equation (8) we have:

Er(xk,÷k) = (klp —

(A'

+(A — A1)(ip

A)'I'

(9)

where by construction, Er(xk,+k) = mk,,÷k. Finally, define the Pxl selection vector,

(1 o ... 0).

We now state the main proposition of the paper:12

Proposition: Given that short-term expectations are formed according to equation
(1), long-term expectations are consistent if and only if the restrictions:
7k = g'(kxp —

(AA — A)(Ip A1')(Ip A)'I',

j=1
are satisfied.

Provided that the assumptions given in equations (2) and (4) hold, the parameters in
equations (1) and (3) can be estimated consistently using OLS.
To see how these restrictions operate, consider the simplest case in which agents use

only the most recent change in the spot rate to predict the subsequent change, so that
P = I. Then equation (11) yields only a single restriction, which reduces to ak =

a'j.

The long-term expected change is the sum of the individual expected changes, each of which

is just the short-term expected change raised to a power equal to the number of periods

it lies into the future. Note that as long as au < 1, equation (11) implies that aj always
has the sante sign as ak. If agents have short-term bandwagon expectations — by which we

mean that they extrapolate positively past exchange rate changes into the future, a1 > 0
—

then they must have long-term bandwagon expectations if their expectations are to be

consistent. Provided that the model in equation (1) is correctly specified and that P = I,
evidence that short-term expectations are of the bandwagon type (aj > 0) while long-term

expectations are of the distributed lag type (ak < 0) indicates inconsistency.

3. Tests of Consistency

3.1. Data
Our independent measure of the market's expected future spot rate is the median
survey response from three ongoing exchange rate surveys. Each six weeks since mid-1981,

the Economist Financial Report has polled currency-room traders and economists at 14

major banks for their views. They are asked to report their expected value of the dollar
against five currencies (the pound, French franc, Deutsche niark, Swiss franc, and yen) in

three, six and twelve months time. The second and third surveys have been conducted
on a weekly basis since early 1984 by Money Market Services (MMS). About 30 traders
each week report their expectations of the value of the dollar against four currencies (the
pound, Deutsche mark, Swiss franc, and yen) at horizons of one week and one month. The
surveys conducted separately by the London and New York branches of MMS are of local

traders' views, so that there is no overlap in respondents. We use these data sets to check
for the possibility of different characteristics of investors on either side of the Atlantic.13
Table 1 summarizes the coverage of the survey data sets.

It is worth emphasizing that we do not have to treat the median survey response as
though it were a perfect measure of the (unobservable) market expectation. The surveys
may be subject to the same kinds of problems inherent in any proxy for this elusive variable.

It seems reasonable to suppose that the median investor's expectation is an imprecise
estimate of the market's expectation. When agents have different beliefs but their demands

can be aggregated into a single representative investor (which is the only way the concept

of a unique "market" expectation makes any sense), individuals' expectations would be
weighted according to risk tolerance or wealth (see, for example, Rubinstein, 1974). This
implies that the median response will be an imprecise, hut nevertheless unbiased, estimate

of the aggregated expectation as long as risk tolerance and wealth are independent of
individuals' beliefs about the rate of Future depreciation. A second source of measurement

error arises because only a subsample of the investing population is surveyed. As with any

sampling method, the resulting measurement error will be purely random provided that
the sample group's expectations do not differ systematically over time from those of the
population.

Our estimation strategy allows for these sources of measurement error. Because the

survey responses will be used only on the left-hand side of equations (1) and (3), any
measurement error the surveys contain will end up in the contemporaneous residuals, ii,t
and 4k1' and will not affect our tests of consistency.

3.2. Estimation

where 81,1+1 and 8k.t+k represent the survey expected depreciation of the dollar against

the foreign currency over the subsequent single period and k periods, respectively, and pj,g
and Pk,t include any measurement errors in the survey medians. Before turning to the

estimates, we discuss several econometric issues.

Point estimates of the parameters in equation (12) can be obtained using OLS. How-

ever, OLS will yield incorrect estimates of the standard errors because tinder the null
hypothesis, the system residuals will display both contemporaneous and serial correla-

tion. Contemporaneous correlation of /tt and Jtki will occur because any "other" factors

used in short-term forecasts are also likely to be used for long-term forecasts. Even if
agents form their expectations by looking only at the past history of the spot rate, so that

,tu is purely random measurement error, these errors are likely to be contemporaneously
correlated across forecast horizons.

Second, except in the extreme case in which the residuals are purely due to measurement error, serial correlation is also likely to be a problem. To see this, focus first
10

on the long-horizon residual, /Zkt- From equation (12), consistency implies that Pk,1 =

Er(Et_1
d

>.:'Td g'A'c1÷_1). This term will in general be correlated with

g'A1e1i÷j_) since by the law of iterated projections, the conditional expectation of

a future variable follows a martingale. Note that this is true even if the realized short-term

residuals are serially uncorrelated, E,(jzi,jzig+i) = 0. In spite of the large measurement

error component they no doubt contain, the short-horizon residuals will generally also
exhibit correlation over time.

To correct for these problems, we use an extension of the GMM estimate of the
parameter covariance matrix suggested originally by Hansen (1982) and modified by Newey

and West (1985). This estimator allows for contemporaneous and noncontemporaneous

correlations of unknown form (both across and within forecast horizons). In addition,
within this framework it is straightforward to allow for conditional heteroskedasticity in the

residuals as well. There is evidence, however, that heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance

estimators may tend to bias the standard errors downward. Consequently, and in an effort
to be conservative, we estimated both hojuoskedasticity- and heteroskedasticity-consistent

standard errors and have reported only the larger of the two.t4 To guarantee that our
estimate of the qovariance matrix is positive definite, we follow Newey and West (1985)
by discounting ith order autocovariances by 1 — I/(T25 + 1), where T is the number of
time-series observations.

In order to specify the lag length P, we began with P = 1 and increased it incremen-

tally. In almost all cases the higher order lags above P = 2 were both economically and
statistically insignificant. We present estimates for both P equal to I and 2, although the
qualitatively nature of the results does not depend on the precise value of P.

3.3. Regression Results
Our first set of tables contains estimates of the system described by equation (13) for

11

the case in which P is set to 1. The second set allow P to be 2. In order to gain a sense
for the economic importance of our formal consistency tests, we turn in the second part
of this section to a set of figures which display the impact of a contemporaneous exchange

rate shock on expected future spot rates.
Table 2 reports the regression results for the five currencies included in the Economist

survey for the case in which P =

1.

The forecast horizons for this survey are three, six

and twelve months, so that the system in equation (13) must be extended to allow for
three equations instead of two. Table 2 shows thai the coefficients on the current exchange

rate change, ajj, I = 3,6,12, are statistically less than zero. In the case of the British
pound, for example, the point estimates imply that a 10 percent dollar appreciation over
the past three months leads to an expected depreciation of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.8 percent over

the following three, six and twelve months, respectively. The coefficients for the other
currencies are similar. The last column in Table 2 reports a Wald test of the consistency

restrictions given in equations (11) and (12). The data reject consistency for all live
currencies.

Tables 3 and 4, respectively, report the results for P =

1

from the New York and

London surveys conducted by MMS. Note that the forecast horizons are now shorter, at

one week and one month. In both of these tables, most of the coefficients are positive,
indicating the presence of a bandwagon effect. At the one week horizon, 6 out of 8 of these
are statistically positive at the five percent level. By comparison, only one of the one-month

coefficients is statistically positive and, while some are negative, none is statistically less
than zero. In the case of the British pound, the coefficients reported in Table 3 imply that
a 10 percent dollar appreciation over the past week leads on average to expectations of an
additional 1.0 percent appreciation over the following week and a 0.1 percent appreciation
over the following month. In these tables, there is little evidence against consistency: only

one of the WaId tests rejects at the five percent level. We nevertheless investigate the
implications of the point estimates below.
12

We cannot test formally the consistency restrictions across data sets, since the models

are not nested. Nevertheless, it is important to note that, for all of the currencies, only the

shorter-term expectations at the one-week and one-month horizons are related positively

to the past exchange rate change. Bandwagon expectations do not appear, however, at
any of the longer horizons: the coefficients are negative. Thus, even though we cannot
test formally the hypothesis that across surveys the coefficients are the same, the point
estimates decline systematically and substantially as the forecast horizon is increased. As

we will see in the graphs below, the fact that the short-term estimates are negative and
long-term estimates are positive indicates that the short-term expectations will overreact
in comparison with long-term expectations.

Tables 5, 6, and 7 present estimates for each of the three surveys when P is set to 2.
While in some cases the added coefficients are statistically significant, they have no effect

on the a11 coefficients reported in Tables 2, 3, and 4. The Wald tests for the Economist

data in Table 5 continue to reject the null hypothesis that expectations are consistent.
The New York MMS data set in Tables 6, however, now rejects consistency restrictions in

2 out of 4 currencies (the Swiss franc and yen), both at significance levels of five percent.

The London MMS data in Table 7, however, do not reject the hypothesis of consistency
for any of the currencies.

3.4. Graphical Results
Because of the complexity of the cross equation restrictions given by equations (11) and

(12), it is difficult to interpret the economic importance of either the Wald test statistics

or the parameter estimates in Tables 2 through 7. In this section we therefore look at
the graphical iinplications of our results for the future spot rate path. The pictures can
give us a sense (which a Wald statistic cannot) both of the qualitative importance of any
inconsistencies, and, more importantly, for whether consistency fails because short-term
expectations move too much or too little with respect to long-term expectations.

Consider the following experiment. Assume the exchange rate is a steady state in
13

which current and past exchange rate changes are equal to zero.15 We then shock the spot

rate and trace out its expected future path as implied by both the short- and long-horizon
forecasts. The graphs of these experiments are presented below.16

Figures 1 through 5 depict the expected future path for each of the five currencies
in the Economist survey in the case where P = 1. The initial exchange rate appreciation
is one percent. All of the figures show that the ultimate expected effect of an exchange
rate shock depends substantially on whether three, six, or twelve month expectations are

iterated forward. For example, the paths in Figure 1 for the British pound imply that
when the current spot rate is perturbed by 1.0 percent, the long-run spot rate predicted
by the three-month expectations is (.88-80)1.80 = 0.10 percent higher than the long-run
level predicted by the six-month expectations, and (.88..72)/.72 = 0.22 percent higher than

the long-run level predicted by the twelve-month expectations. Across all five graphs, a

clear pattern emerges: a positive exchange rate shock generates a higher expected long
run value of the spot rate when shorter-run expectations are used than when longer-run

expectations are used. Notice, however, that for all three forecasting equations, part of
the original one percent dollar appreciation is undone, so that the long-run value increases

less than proportionately in response to current shocks.
Figures 6 through 9, and 10 through 13 show the expected future path when P =

1

for

the New York and London MMS data sets, respectively. As a group these graphs exhibit
two distinctive properties. The first is that within each data set, the one-week expectations

overreact to an exchange rate shock in comparison with the one-month expectations. This
is the same pattern we saw above. The second distinctive feature of these figures involves

a comparison with the Economist graphs. In the MMS data sets, the long run equilibrium

periods into the future. We use'1 the predictions from cite short-horizon equatioss for the expected change

spot rate increases more than proportionately in response to an exchange rate shock. This

is a pattern precisely opposite to that demonstrated in the Economist data. Nevertheless,

it is still consistent with the finding that shorter-term expectations appear to be more
sensitive to exchange rate shocks that are longer-term expectations.
Graphs 14 through 26 parallel exactly the earlier set, with P set to 2. The qualitative

results are the sante here as when P was fixed at 1. If anything the increase in the order

of the distributed lag increases the visual appearance of the overreaction of short-term
forecasts relative to long-terni forecasts (especially in the MMS data, Figures 6-13 and
19-26).

4. Conclusions
We have derived a property, called consistency, which all rational forecasts have, hut
which itself does not require rationality. Our tests using survey data on exchange rate

expectations indicate that expectations generally fail to be consistent. Most striking is the
particular way in which investors fail to coordinate their predictions: in their shorter-term

forecasts, investors tend to exaggerate the implications of current exchange rate changes

for the value of the spot rate further into the future. If longer-term forecasts are used as
the norm, shorter-tenn expectations overreact to current exchange rate changes.

One possible way to explain the failure of expectations to be consistent is to think
of agents using different models to forecast the spot rate at short versus long horizons,
and a blend in between. Fankel and Froot (1986), for example, model the expectations of
"chartists" and "fundamentalists" and suggest that agents form expectations by weighting

these views according to their own expected trading horizon (with chartist views more
important for short horizons, and fundamentalists views more important for long horizons).

But obviously, no single explanation of our findings can be completely satisfying, since a

failure of consistency implies that expectations cannot be rational.
A second way to explain the rejections of consistency would be that the survey data
systematically mismeasure the market's true expectation.17 If, for example, agents report

repeatedly the mode rather than the mean of their subjective distribution, then there is
no reason that consistency should hold in these data. Nevertheless, when we tried to test
the restrictions developed above using the forward discount in place of the survey measure

of expected depreciation, we found results sinjilar to those reported in Tables 2 through

7. We do not present these results, however, because of the difficulty in interpreting
them in view of the likely contamination of the forward market data by an exchange
risk premium.18 Nevertheless, one could interpret these results as suggesting that the
'TWe are grateful to tiny Snmmenfo, the following point.

the Forward market test., the coefficie.g, were emaller in a),,ol,ute value than thoce i,re.eute.I ix, Table. 2 . 7, but very
,imilar in sign and statistical significance. In addition, the result, of consistency tests were similar to those reported above.

16

explanation for inconsistency found in the survey data is not solely a result of a tendency
to misineasure expectations.

One important caveat to keep in mind when interpreting our tests is that the expectations process may not be described completely by the observable history of spot
rate changes. If other variables matter for expettations, then our results may be biased,
although it is not obvious why the bias would produce the persistent appearance of overreaction in short-term expectations.
