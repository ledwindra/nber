    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore trends over time in the labor force participation of veterans and non-veterans and investigate whether these patterns are consistent with a rising role for the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Disability Compensation (DC) program, which pays benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities and has grown rapidly since 2000.  Using 35 years of March CPS data, we find that veterans\u2019 labor force participation declined over time in a way that coincides closely with DC growth and that veterans have become more sensitive to economic shocks.  Our findings suggest that DC program growth has contributed to recent declines in veterans\u2019 labor force participation.\n\n",
