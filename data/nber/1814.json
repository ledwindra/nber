The response of the economy to realand price shocks is examined in a number of cases. Each case corresponds toa particular assumption about fiscal policy and a particular assumptionabout monetary policy. Estimates are also presented of the size of thegovernment spending cuts that are needed to meet a given deficit goal underdifferent assumptions about monetary policy.\n\n",
