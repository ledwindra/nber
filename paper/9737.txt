ABSTRACT
In this paper we document three credit market imperfections prevalent in middle income countries
that can help to explain boom-bust cycles, as well as other macroeconomic patterns observed at
higher frequencies across these countries. These imperfections are: the existence of financing
constraints that affect mainly the nontradables sector, currency mismatch and guarantees that cover
lenders against systemic crises. In MICs T-sector firms have access to international capital markets,
while most N-firms are bank-dependent and are financially constrained. Systemic guarantees
generate incentives for borrowers to take on insolvency risk by denominating debt in foreign
currency. This currency mismatch makes movements in the real exchange rate --the relative price
between N and T goods-- the driving element in the amplification of shocks.

1. Introduction
In recent decades many middle income countries (MICs) have liberalized their financial
markets. Financial liberalization has typically been followed by lending booms during which
credit grows unusually fast. Some of these booms have been punctuated by twin currency
and banking crises that are followed by a protracted credit crunch.
In this paper we document three credit market imperfections prevalent in MICs that can
explain these boom-bust cycles as well as other macroeconomic patterns observed at higher
frequencies across MICs. These imperfections are the existence of borrowing constraints (the
eﬀects of which diﬀer across sectors), currency mismatch and systemic bailout guarantees.
Prior to twin crises the typical MIC experiences a real exchange rate appreciation and a
lending boom during which the ratio of credit-to-GDP grows unusually fast. In the aftermath
of twin crises there is typically a short-lived recession and a protracted credit crunch that
persists long after aggregate growth has resumed. The credit crunch hits mainly small and
nontradables (N) firms. In fact, nontradables production declines relative to the output of
the tradables (T) sector for several years after the crisis, and the credit-to-GDP ratio falls.
This asymmetric sectorial pattern is also observed before a crisis as the N-sector grows faster
than the T-sector.
In contrast to the crises of earlier decades, large fiscal deficits have not taken center
stage in the new boom-bust cycles. Furthermore, investment is the component of GDP that
experiences by far the largest swings over the cycle, and, at the other extreme, consumption
varies the least.

1

These comovements between credit, the N-to-T output ratio and the real exchange rate
also arise at higher frequencies, even if we do not condition on the occurrence of crises. Panel
regressions reveal that credit growth is positively correlated with the ratio of N-to-T output,
with changes in the real exchange rate, and with investment growth. However, credit growth
is not significantly correlated with either aggregate GDP growth or consumption.
These comovements and the boom-bust cycle are not observed in countries with developed
financial markets. They appear to be the same across MICs, in spite of diﬀerent exchange rate
regimes. These facts indicate that the mechanisms at work are not dependent on particular
features of the exchange rate regime, but rather on other institutional characteristics of
MICs. It has been argued in the literature that they are generated by the interaction of
three characteristics of financing typical of MICs. First, there is a pronounced asymmetry in
size and financing opportunities across tradables (T) and non-tradables (N) sectors. While
T-sector firms tend to be large and have access to world capital markets, N-sector firms are
smaller on average, are bank-dependent and face borrowing constraints.1
Second, in MICs a substantial amount of N-sector debt is dollar denominated, while the
income streams that service those debts are in domestic currency. Since domestic banks are
heavily exposed to the N-sector, the degree of currency mismatch is significant. Even when
the banks’ balance sheets are equilibrated, banks face a de facto currency mismatch because
they lend primarily to the N-sector. Thus, they face insolvency risk.
Third, creditors are covered, either explicitly or implicitly, by systemic bailout guaran1

In MICs T-sector firms have easy access to external finance because they can either pledge export
receivables as collateral, or can get guarantees from closely linked firms.

tees. It is expected that if a critical mass of debtors risks insolvency, the government will
implement policies to ensure that creditors get repaid (at least in part) and thus avoid an
economic meltdown. These policies may come in the form of an easing of monetary policy,
the maintenance of an exchange rate peg, or the handing out of checks.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we document the credit market imperfections. In Section 3 we characterize the boom-bust cycle and the comovements alluded to
above. In Section 4 we describe the mechanism that links the credit market imperfections
to the stylized facts. Finally in Section 5 we present the conclusions.

2. Credit Market Imperfections
Here we present evidence on the three key credit market imperfections that prevail in MICs:
asymmetric financing opportunities, currency mismatch and systemic guarantees.
We classify as MICs all countries that satisfy the following four conditions: they have a
per-capita income between $1,000 and $18,000; in addition to banks, the stock market is a
viable source of finance; they have a population greater than 1 million people; the country
has not engaged in war or civil war during the sample period. Thirty seven countries satisfy
these conditions. We also consider Sweden and Finland, whose per capita incomes are greater
than $18,000 but have experienced often studied twin crises. Thus, our sample consists of
39 countries.2 We consider the period between 1980 and 1999.

2.1. Asymmetric Financing Opportunities
In order to investigate whether there is a significant diﬀerence between firms in the T-sector
and those in the N-sector, we use firm level data from a panel of 3877 firms of the World
Business Economic Survey of the World Bank (WBES, 2001). This survey covers 27 out
of our sample of 39 MICs, and it classifies firms according to their size and, among other
things, whether or not they export.3 Since the share of T-output in the group of export
firms is greater than that of non-export firms, we identify exporters with T-sector firms and
non-exporters with N-sector firms.
The first question we ask is whether firms in the T-sector tend to be larger than those
in the N-sector. The answer is positive. Table 2.1 shows that, across the 27 countries in the
WBES survey, a majority (68 percent) of small and medium firms belongs to the N-sector,
while a majority (67 percent) of large firms belongs to the T-sector. This fact holds true
when looking at the matrices of individual countries. Table 2.2 shows that the distribution

The survey also asked firms to rank, on a scale from 1 to 4, how much of an obstacle
financing was to running their business. We use the answers from this survey to estimate an
ordered probit model to assess whether there exists an asymmetry in financing opportunities
across the N and T-sectors.5
We create a dummy variable for the yes-or-no answer “do you export?” A significant
positive parameter on the dummy indicates that N-sector firms evaluate the access to finance

There are some large firms in the N-sector, such as utilities. However, in most countries they represent
a small share of the N-sector firms in the survey.

We use the same approach as Schiﬀer and Weder (2001), who compare small and large firms with
respect to financing constraints as well as other indicators of governance. They find that small firms are

n = 27, and EXP ORT is either a dummy that takes the value of 1 if the firm does not
export, or it is the share of exports in output among exporting firms. GOV controls for
government participation in the firm, AGE denotes the year a firm was established and
d1 ...dn are country dummies. The dependent variable, y, captures the ranking of the severity
of an obstacle for running a business, as perceived by the firms. The obstacles considered
are financing, collateral and the exchange rate. The true y is not directly observed, and the
α parameters are estimated together with β 0 ...β 3 and γ 1 ...γ n.
Table 2.3 reports the regression results: regression 1 is the basic regression where we
regress the perceived credit constraints on the N-sector dummy. Regression 2 replaces the
N-Sector by a variable that measures the percentage of output that is exported by exporters.
Regression 3 reports the results of a regression that diﬀerentiates between small and large
N-firms, and includes the age of the firm and the share of government participation as control
variables.

In all regressions we find that there is a significant diﬀerence between exporters and nonexporters in their evaluation of financing as an obstacle to running their businesses. The
latter consider the obstacle to be more severe. Furthermore, we find that among exporters,
the larger the share of exports in output, the less significant is financing deemed to be as an
obstacle for running a business. We also find that older firms have easier access to financing
than younger firms. The same is true for firms with high government participation. None of
the control variables, however, obviates the role of the exporters/non-exporters indicator.
Next, we ask whether bank credit depends on collateral and whether there is a statistically
significant diﬀerence between the N- and T-sectors in this respect. Tables 2.4 and 2.5 shed
light on this question. Table 2.4 shows that in most MICs, the majority of bank loans are
indeed secured by collateral. The percentage ranges from 40% in Malaysia to 90% in Korea.
In Table 2.5 we make use again of the WBES data set, where firms were also asked to
evaluate how much of an obstacle the access to collateral is to running their business. Table
2.5 shows that even after controlling for other factors, such as government share and the age
of the firm, the importance of collateral is viewed as significantly more severe by the firms

in the N-sector than those in the T-sector.
Aside from easier access to bank credit, firms in the T-sector are typically large firms
that have the possibility to issue bonds and stocks as substitutes for bank credit. Figure 2.6
illustrates this for the case of Korea. While small and medium enterprises account for about
75% of domestic bank credit, more than 90 percent of domestic bonds were issued by large
firms.

2.2. Currency Mismatch and Banks Exposure to the N-sector
Currency mismatch exists when liabilities are denominated in foreign currency, while the
income streams that must service these debts are denominated in domestic currency. Currency mismatch has become an important issue in MICs because sudden real depreciations
increase significantly the debt burden of a large group of agents, generating a meltdown of
the banking system.
Unfortunately, there are no readily available indices of currency mismatch, so the question
arises as to how best to measure this concept. First of all, currency mismatch need not be a
problem that aﬀects the aggregate economy. It is a sectorial problem that mainly aﬀects the

N-sector. It may well be the case that there is enough foreign currency available to service
the debt. However, if N-sector debtors and the banks that lend to them have currency
mismatch, then a real depreciation might generate a meltdown, unless the government can
implement a redistribution from the T to the N-sector on short notice. Clearly, these fiscal
transfers are not feasible.
Since in MICs banks are heavily exposed to the N-sector, we can get a more precise
indicator of currency mismatch by looking at the balance sheet of the banking system.
Table 2.7 shows that, on average, only about a third of bank lending goes to firms that can
potentially be classified as belonging to the tradeable sector. This indicates that the banking
system is strongly exposed to the N-sector.6

In order to bias the results against the hypothesis that banks are heavily exposed to the N-sector,

Note. 1) Data on loans in Chile are 1985. 2) Foreign liabilities data in Korea is from 1993 –
thus the mismatch in 97 must have been much larger. 3) The results are biased against
finding our hypothesis of currency mismatch in several important ways: 1) Off balance
sheet items are not included, which are primarily in foreign currency. 2)Due to legislation
banks tend to underreport their foreign currency holdings as a share of liabilities (see
Kamin et. al 2001). 3) We assume that all revenues from exports can be used to service the
debt. All firms in potentially tradable sectors are assumed to indeed be tradeable.

Since banks are strongly exposed to the N-sector we cannot determine the degree of
currency mismatch by simply comparing the liabilities and the assets of the banking system.
A bank can have 20% of its liabilities in dollars and 20% of its assets denominated in
dollars. However, if all the loans are granted to the N-sector, there is a de facto currency
mismatch because there is insolvency risk. It may be even more misleading just to compare
the denomination of deposits and loans, as these are only a subset, and a small subset at
that, of the total balance sheet.7
we assume that all firms in sectors that are commonly considered tradable are indeed tradable. Thus, we
group manufacturing, mining, agriculture, forestry, and primary production as tradables, while construction,
services, electricity-gas-water are considered nontradables. Note that the fraction of bank lending that goes
to consumption or housing credit is not covered by foreign currency income and thus also counts as nontradable. In most countries, the figures would be even higher if these items were included (consumption and
housing credit are only available for Hungary, Mexico and Thailand).
7
For instance, foreign currency deposits in Thailand account for less than 10% of the total foreign external
liabilities of the banking system.

Our index of currency mismatch compares the share of foreign currency liabilities of the
banking system to the share of loans that are covered by export income. We compute the
latter ratio by multiplying the share of bank lending that goes to the T-sector by the share
of T-sector output that is actually exported. Column (c) in Table 2.8 shows that exporting
firms sell the majority of their output in the domestic market. Thus, they too must earmark
a large share of domestic currency revenue for servicing foreign currency debt.
Our index of currency mismatch is reported in column (e) of Table 2.8. The estimates
range from 2.97 for Korea in 1997 to 4.34 for Mexico in 1995.8 To see that currency mismatch
is mostly a sectorial, not an aggregate, problem compare Table 2.8 with Table 2.9. Notice
that the foreign debt service-to-exports ratio is low in countries with a high currency mismatch index. A banking system where only 15-30% of dollar loans are covered by exports
are certainly subject to substantial real exchange rate risk. This is true even though the
aggregate measures of Table 2.9 do not indicate currency mismatch.9
8

Our estimates of CM are conservative. More realistic/accurate estimates would take into account that
the amount of foreign currency revenue that is available to service debt is less than total foreign currency
income. Some of the foreign currency income is required to pay oﬀ the factors of production.

A high foreign debt service-to-exports ratio signals a CM problem. However, just because this aggregate

2.3. Systemic Guarantees
Despite the fact that bailout guarantees have played an important role in several explanations of boom-bust cycles, the evidence supporting the existence of this distortion is mainly
anecdotal. Although many countries have systemic guarantees in place, it is very diﬃcult to
document their existence directly. The diﬃculty in pinning guarantees down is that in most
cases they are implicit. To begin with, they are not limited to promises to hand out a bailout
payment to lenders in case of default. They are often implicit in the exchange rate regime
and monetary policy rules. Since in most instances one of the objectives of policymakers
is to avoid sharp drops in output, they will implement policies that are, de facto, implicit
guarantees against systemic crises.10
We investigate whether there are implicit guarantees by looking at the behavior of interest
rate spreads. The idea is that if guarantees are present, the spread will, ceteris paribus, be
insensitive to a deterioration in the average quality of loans, assuming, of course, that no
crisis has yet occurred. When a crisis occurs, the quality of loans collapses and the spread
skyrockets.
An ideal way to measure the evolution of the loans’ quality is with the ‘true’ share of
non-performing loans (NPLs). Unfortunately, such data in time series form does not exist
for most MICs. A good proxy for an increase in NPLs is the occurrence of a lending boom
in the recent past. When there is a sharp acceleration in credit, the monitoring capacity
measure may be low, one cannot infer that there is no CM.
10
Systemic guarantees are not the same as deposit insurance schemes, which cover individual agents against
idiosyncratic risk.

14

of both banks and regulators is diminished, so that there is an increase in the likelihood of
granting credit to bad projects. The increase in the share of NPLs may take some time to
materialize because it takes time for a given loan to become non-performing and because
during the boom a lot of new loans are being granted. Nonetheless, after some time NPLs
must become a problem for the banking system. This is true regardless of whether NPLs
are oﬃcially recorded.
To capture this idea we run the following panel regression

(ρ − r)j,t = αj + α1 LBj,t−1 + α2 Dj,t · LBj,t−1 + εj,t ,

(2.1)

where (ρ − r)j,t is the interest rate spread as defined earlier, in country j at time t. LBj,t−1 is
a dummy that indicates the existence of a lending boom. It is equal to one if during the past
2 years real credit has grown by more than 10% on average. Dj,t is a dummy that indicates
that twin banking and currency crises have occurred at t or t − 1.
The coeﬃcient α1 measures the eﬀect of an increase in NPLs on the spread in countryyears in which a crisis has not occurred in either the current or the previous year. Meanwhile,
the sum α1 + α2 measures the eﬀect of an increase in NPLs on the spread during crisis times
(at t or t − 1). As we discussed above, in order to isolate the eﬀect of guarantees we need to
distinguish between periods in which a crisis has not occurred recently, and periods where a
crisis has occurred recently. This is because systemic crises are typically preceded by lending
booms and during crises the spread shoots up.
The null hypothesis that there are systemic guarantees is H0 : α1 = 0. Table 2.10 exhibits

Note: The table shows the estimates of the panel regression in (5.1).
The lending boom dummy, LB, is equal to one, if the growth rate of
real credit has been larger than 10 percent on average for the past two
years. The crisis dummy, D, indicates that a twin crisis occurred in t or
t+1. The regressions are estimated with fixed effects, using a GLS
estimator. Standard errors are reported in parentheses; * indicates
significance at the 10 percent level, ** indicates significance at the 5

the estimates of regression (2.1). Panel (a) considers a set of 8 MICs frequently discussed
in the literature, while panel (b) considers the full set of 39 MICs. In both cases we cannot
reject the null at the 10% significance level. That is, we cannot reject the presence of systemic
guarantees. Interestingly, if the crisis dummy is disregarded and the spread is regressed only
on the lending boom dummy, the estimated coeﬃcient is statistically significant at the 10%
level.
If we were to define systemic guarantees literally as promises to hand out a bailout
payment to lenders in case of default, we could investigate the proportion of crises that
have triggered this type of bailouts, and then impose rational expectations to infer the exante implicit guarantee. Bordo and Schwarz (2001) and Jeanne and Zettelmeyer (2000) find
evidence of ex-post bailouts during the last two decades and the early banking crises of the
20th century.

3. Macroeconomic Patterns
The credit market imperfections we have documented give rise to macroeconomic patterns
that are common across MICs, but are not typically observed in high income countries. In
this section we illustrate these patterns both by examining the comovements of the relevant
variables conditioning on the occurrence of twin crises, and by characterizing the unconditional comovements of these variables. In the next section we describe the mechanism that
links the credit market imperfections to the macroeconomic patterns.
We characterize the boom-bust cycle by means of event windows over the period 19801999 on the set of 39 MICs where, in addition to banks, the stock market is a viable source
of finance. Figure 3.1 shows that prior to a crisis there is a real appreciation and a lending
boom during which credit grows unusually fast. In the aftermath of a crisis there is typically
a short-lived recession and a protracted credit crunch that aﬀects mainly the N-sector. In
fact, N-production declines relative to the output of the T-sector and the credit-to-GDP
ratio continues to fall for several years after the crisis. Investment is the component of GDP
that exhibits by far the largest (and statistically significant) deviations from tranquil times,
while consumption deviations are very mild and insignificant.11
We characterize the unconditional comovements by means of panel regressions over the
same period and set of countries. In the panel regressions, we allow for random and fixed
eﬀects.12 The partial correlations cannot, of course, be interpreted as causal relations. How11

Figure 3.1 is taken from Tornell and Westerman (2002a). See that paper for details.
All variables are in first diﬀerences in order to avoid the issues associated with non-stationarity. These
patterns have been characterized by Tornell and Westermann (2002b).

ever, they indicate the variables that theoretical models should emphasize.
The first regression in Table 3.1 shows that an increase in credit is associated with (i) a
decline in the interest rate spread, (ii) an increase in the ratio of N-to-T output, and (iii) a
real appreciation. It is remarkable that these partial correlations are significant at the 1%
level. Correlation (i) suggests the existence of a credit channel. Correlation (ii) is consistent
with the fact that the N-sector is more credit-constrained than the T-sector. Correlation
(iii) is consistent with the existence of a balance sheet eﬀect.13
Among components of GDP, what is surprising is the dog that didn’t bark: consumption
and net exports do not move with credit growth. In contrast, investment and the fiscal deficit

The MICs we examine have experienced crises from time to time during the sample period. We are not
limiting ourselves to analyzing the events surrounding crises, and the comovements of Tables 3.1 and 3.2 are
not conditional on the occurrence of crises.

vary strongly with credit. Regressions 2 and 3 show that all parameters, except those on
consumption and net exports, are significant at the 5% level. We find similar results using
fixed eﬀects estimation (Table 3.2). After dropping insignificant variables, all remaining
variables are significant at the 5% level and have the same sign as in the random eﬀects
model.
As we can see in Figure 3.1, macroeconomic variables display similar comovements as
those shown in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. These stylized facts suggest that investment, rather
than consumption, should play a key role in the amplification mechanism. Furthermore,
they indicate that any model of macroeoconomic comovements or of crises in MICs should
generate an equilibrium path along which credit varies negatively with the real exchange
rate, and positively with the N-to-T output ratio.
20

4. The Mechanism
To explain some of the stylized facts that we have described, the literature has looked to
financial market imperfections as key ‘fundamentals’. Existing models are typically based
on one of two distortions: either “bad policy”, in the form of bailout guarantees, or “bad
markets”, in the form asymmetric information, or the imperfect enforceability of contracts
in financial markets.14
On the one hand, policies that ensure agents against systemic crises (i.e., systemic bailout
guarantees), lead agents to take on more risk than they otherwise would. This can explain
risky debt denomination. On the other hand, credit market imperfections such as imperfect
enforceability of contracts or asymmetric information lead lenders to be very conservative
and give rise to credit constraints. The question arises as to whether one can construct
an internally consistent framework where guarantees do not neutralize the credit market
imperfections. Furthermore, can the interaction between these two distortions generate the
dynamic patterns that characterize the boom-bust cycle and the comovements alluded to
above?
Schneider and Tornell (2000) consider an economy where these two distortions do not
neutralize each other and show how their interaction generates several features of the boom
cycle. Tornell and Westermann (2002a and 2002b) show how this framework can explain the
comovements alluded to above and the strong credit channel that exists in MICs.
14

See for instance, Aghion, Bacchetta and Banerjee (2000), Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2000),
Caballero and Krishnamurthy (1999), Calvo (1998), Corsetti, Pesenti and Roubini (1999), Krugman (1999)
and Mckinnon and Pill (1998).

21

In what follows we discuss how some elements of these papers help explain the macroeconomic patterns we described in the previous section. Consider an economy with two sectors:
a tradables sector (T) and a nontradables sector (N). T-sector agents have access to perfect
capital markets, while N-sector agents face enforceability problems and systemic guarantees.
The first key result is that the interaction of systemic guarantees and enforceability
problems generates a self-reinforcing mechanism. On the one hand, if there is suﬃcient real
exchange rate risk: (a) binding credit constraints arise and (b) it is individually optimal for
an N-sector agent to issue debt denominated in T-goods (i.e., borrow in foreign currency
on a short-term). On the other hand, when many N-sector agents gamble by denominating
their debt in T goods, exchange rate risk may be endogenously created, as the economy
becomes vulnerable to self-fulfilling meltdowns of the banking system. If the amount of
T denominated debt is high, a real depreciation can severely squeeze cash flow, or even
bankrupt banks altogether. Since they face binding borrowing constraints, they then have
to curtail lending to the N-sector. Weak investment demand from the N-sector for its own
products in turn validates the real depreciation. The systemic credit risk created by the
banking system thus induces endogenous exchange rate risk.
The second key result is that the interaction of binding borrowing constraints and T
denominated debt generates a dynamic path that resembles a boom-bust cycle and the
comovements we have characterized earlier. During the boom, the real appreciation reduces
the debt burden and relaxes credit constraints, permitting unusually fast growth in the
bank-dependent N-sector. This leads to further real appreciation, further relaxation of credit

22

constraints and so on. Since the T-sector is not credit constrained, both the credit-to GDP
and the N-to-T output ratios follow increasing paths. However, the existence of risky debt
denomination makes the economy vulnerable to self-fulfilling twin crises, during which a real
depreciation coincides with both a meltdown of the banking system and a collapse of the
N-sector’s internal funds. In the aftermath of crisis the N-sector is outperformed by the
T-sector. Since banks are strongly exposed to the N-sector, a long-lasting credit crunch
outlives a brief recession.
To understand the amplification mechanism in more detail consider an increase in the
domestic lending rate. This shock leads to higher debt service obligations and thus implies
that firms can now borrow less at each level of net worth. Lower borrowing results in lower
investment. This direct eﬀect is amplified because there is currency mismatch and part of
N-sector’s demand comes from the N-sector itself. In this case, the fall in demand for Ngoods, leads to a real depreciation. Since N-sector agents have dollar debt on the books,
while their revenues are denominated in the local currency, there is a fall in N-sector’s profits
and net worth. A vicious circle ensues as lower net worth leads to even lower investment,
which leads to a lower demand for N-goods and a steeper real depreciation, which leads to
lower net worth and so on. This process might lead to twin crises in which a critical mass
of N-sector agents goes bust.
T-sector agents have access to international capital markets and can more easily substitute away from domestic borrowing. Thus, their decisions are mostly aﬀected by the world
interest rate, not by the domestic lending rate. Therefore, a fall in credit is associated with a

23

real depreciation and a decline in the N-to-T output ratio. Furthermore, the sectorial asymmetry implies that the decline in GDP growth is milder than that of credit. This explains
the persistent swings in the credit-to-GDP ratio observed in the data.

5. Conclusions
In this paper we have documented the existence of three credit markets imperfection prevalent in middle income countries (MICs). We have also discussed how they can account for
macroeoconomic patterns observed across MICs in recent decades.
In MICs borrowing constraints aﬀect many firms. However, their incidence is heavily
biased towards the non-tradables (N) sector. While tradables (T) sector firms tend to be
large and have access to world capital markets, N-sector firms are smaller on average and
are bank-dependent.
A second imperfection is the substantial amount of N-sector debt that is denominated in
foreign currency, while the income streams that service those debts are in domestic currency.
Since domestic banks are heavily exposed to the N-sector, the degree of currency mismatch
is significant.
This sharp asymmetry in financial opportunities and the severe currency mismatch are
key to understanding why there are sharp fluctuations in the real exchange rate (the relative
price of N and T goods), and why they play a key role in the amplification and propagation
of shocks in MICs.
The prevalence of currency mismatch does not appear out of the blue, but rather is the

24

optimal response of borrowers and creditors to the existence of systemic guarantees, the third
imperfection we have documented.
There is much work to be done in understanding economic fluctuations in MICs. This paper contributes to the literature by highlighting common macroeconomic regularities and by
documenting the existence of three credit market imperfections that are prevalent in otherwise very diﬀerent MICs. In so doing, we have restricted the classes of plausible explanations
for economic fluctuations that are common across MICs.
