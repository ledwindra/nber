Climatic Constraints on Aggregate Economic Output
Marshall Burke and Vincent Tanutama
NBER Working Paper No. 25779
April 2019
JEL No. O13,Q5,Q54
ABSTRACT
Efficient responses to climate change require accurate estimates of both aggregate damages and
where and to whom they occur. While specific case studies and simulations have suggested that
climate change disproportionately affects the poor, large-scale direct evidence of the magnitude
and origins of this disparity is lacking. Similarly, evidence on aggregate damages, which is a
central input into the evaluation of mitigation policy, often relies on country-level data whose
accuracy has been questioned. Here we assemble longitudinal data on economic output from over
11,000 districts across 37 countries, including previously nondigitized sources in multiple
languages, to assess both the aggregate and distributional impacts of warming temperatures. We
find that local-level growth in aggregate output responds non-linearly to temperature across all
regions, with output peaking at cooler temperatures (<10°C) than estimated in earlier country
analyses and declining steeply thereafter. Long difference estimates of the impact of longer-term
(decadal) trends in temperature on income are larger than estimates from an annual panel model,
providing additional evidence for growth effects. Impacts of a given temperature exposure do not
vary meaningfully between rich and poor regions, but exposure to damaging temperatures is
much more common in poor regions. These results indicate that additional warming will
exacerbate inequality, particularly across countries, and that economic development alone will be
unlikely to reduce damages, as commonly hypothesized. We estimate that since 2000, warming
has already cost both the US and the EU at least $4 trillion in lost output, and tropical countries
are >5% poorer than they would have been without this warming.

Introduction
Global policy debates about climate change mitigation center on the aggregate economic costs and benefits of
particular mitigation action, as well as to whom these costs and benefits accrue. Quantifying the magnitude
and distribution of these costs and benefits is now a focus of a large literature, much of which has sought
to empirically estimate how various societal outcomes might be affected by a changing climate. Recent
efforts combine measurements of the climate system with statistical methods designed to isolate the impacts
of observed changes in climate from other factors that might also affect social or economic outcomes of
interest. These studies provide strong causal evidence that key productive elements of economies, from
agriculture to labor productivity to human health, respond non-linearly to changes in climate.1
Inferring both aggregate economic costs and their distribution from these multiple foundational damages,
however, is often challenging. For instance, a complete accounting of aggregate costs requires both that all
relevant economic sectors can be enumerated and evaluated, and also that any interaction in impacts between
sectors is accurately quantified. Meeting these requirements is demanding even in data-rich environments,2
but is likely implausible in much of the world where key sectoral data are lacking and interactions are difficult
to constrain.
An alternate approach uses country-level data on economic aggregates (e.g gross domestic product) to study
total damages.3, 4 While this approach has the advantage of directly observing the aggregated net effect of
myriad interacting sectors that have simultaneously responded to a change in climate, it faces its own set
of important challenges. First, national accounts data on economic output are thought to be both noisy and
potentially biased for many countries in the world, with alternative data sources – and even different vintages
of the same data source – often showing low levels of agreement.5, 6 Second, even if data are unbiased,
measuring the response of economic output to temperature at the country level is challenging because many
different producing units within a country could be exposed to opposing temperature anomalies within a
given year. In fact, in large economies such as the EU countries or the US, temperature anomalies within
a given year are often strongly negatively correlated across the largest producing regions (e.g. US West
coast versus East coast; Fig S1a-b). Averaging these opposing anomalies to construct a country-wide annual
temperature estimates reduces the temperature signal and could greatly amplify noise in a country-level
analysis (Fig S1c-e; Methods).
Third, given the large variation in income within countries, a country-level analysis allows only partial
insight into the distributional effects of warming. In particular, it remains difficult to understand whether
any apparent differences in the effect of warming between rich and poor regions are due to differences
in underlying exposures to harmful temperatures, or to differences in responsiveness at a given level of
temperature exposure.7 Distinguishing these effects is at the core of understanding how both past and future
economic development could shape the size and distribution of climate damages. Finally, given limited
country-level data, it has remained difficult to understand whether a given increase in temperature affects the
level or the growth rate of output, a difference with again fundamental implications for the overall magnitude

2

of future damages.3, 4, 8
Here we assemble a novel district-level panel dataset on climate and GDP across 37 countries and multiple
decades, using economic data from public databases and public non-digitized archives (SI Section 1) and
matching them to average temperature and precipitation in each district-year using three separate climate
datasets. This large dataset on over 11,000 districts allows us to use multiple sources of variation to quantify
the persistent effects of warming on economic output, and to assess how these effects differ between and
within countries. Our results provide a new foundation for assessment of the local and global economic
impact of past and future warming.
We collect GDP data at the most local level available in existing archives, which is typically at the secondlevel administrative division of each country. We denote these units “districts" and their parent level1 administrative level units as “states". Data are harmonized to constant boundaries over the sample
period and merged with estimates of temperature and precipitation in each district-year from three separate
climate datasets,9–11 yielding 154 thousand district-year observations across Brazil, China, Colombia, India,
Indonesia, United States, and the EU countries, with temporal coverage varying by country (Fig 1a). To
assess data quality in the economic data, we follow earlier country-level work12 and compare whether growth
rates in subnational GDP correspond to growth rates in nighttime lights in the same location, the latter an
independent measure of economic activity. We recover average nightlights-GDP relationships in our district
data almost identical to these previous country-level estimates (Fig S2), providing some confidence in quality
of our district-level economic data. The range of temperature exposures and income levels in our dataset
broadly reflect the global country-level distribution (Fig 1b), and our assembled regions represent most of the
largest economies globally as well as many of those judged to have the highest national statistical capacities
(Fig 1c).
To estimate the causal impact of variation in temperature on economic output, we follow a large literature1, 3, 4
and use fixed effects regression to isolate interannual temperature variation from all other time-invariant
factors or common time-varying factors that could be correlated with both average temperature and economic
output. In particular, we estimate:
2
yistd = f (Tist ) + λ1 Pist + λ2 Pist
+ ρd + αi + ηst + εistd

(1)

where i indicates districts, s indicates the admin-1 region each district falls into, t indicates years, and d
indicates data source for GDP data. The outcome yistd is the first difference in log per capita GDP (i.e.
the growth rate). f (Tist ) is a non-linear function of temperature; our main specification is quadratic, i.e.
2 , and we test robustness to more flexible polynomials and splines (Fig 2). We control
f (Tist ) = β1 Tist +β2 Tist

for all time invariant differences between districts with district fixed effects αi ; these account, for instance,
for any fixed geographic, social, economic, or institutional differences between districts. We control for
common time-varying factors with a set of state-by-year fixed effects ηst , which control non-parametrically
for any trending variables at the state level. φd is a data-source fixed effect, which additionally accounts for

3

any changes in dataset within country over time that is not already picked up by the state-year FE. Given
these fixed effects, our estimates of β1 and β2 come from comparing whether economic growth in a given
district (as measured by a specific dataset) was above or below normal in a year that was warmer than average
for that district, after accounting for any shocks to either growth or temperature common to districts in the
surrounding state. Standard errors are clustered at the district level.
Results
We find that district level economic production is concave in temperature exposure, with a negative slope
throughout nearly all the observed temperature distribution and increasingly steep at warmer temperatures
(Fig 2). Results are robust to choice of temperature dataset (Fig 2b, Table S3), to choice of fixed effects or
inclusion of time trends (Fig 2b and Fig S3a), to using more flexible functional forms for temperature (Fig
2b), to dropping one country at a time (Fig S3b), to alternate approaches of excluding or trimming large
growth outliers (Fig S3c-e), and to accounting for spatial lags of the dependent variable (Fig S4). Responses
when models are estimated separately in each country are largely consistent with the pooled global response
(Fig S5), with disagreements largest in countries where the climate datasets show the poorest correlation
with each other (Fig S6), suggesting these differences could be driven by climate data quality. A model that
uses the distribution of daily temperatures instead of annual average temperature to measure temperature
exposure recovers a response consistent in shape with our main response, although point estimates on narrow
temperature bins are somewhat noisier (Fig S7). Our results are broadly consistent with subnational estimates
from US districts13 and state-level estimates from a global sample.14
While estimated short-run effects of additional warming are almost identical to earlier country-level estimates
for warmer regions,4 district level estimates do not provide strong evidence of positive effects in cooler regions
as was suggested in country data. Applying our estimates globally suggests that nearly all regions, including
most wealthy regions, would experience reduced economic growth for any additional warming above their
current 2001-2015 average temperature (Fig 2c).
Conventional wisdom and some evidence7, 15–18 suggests that poorer individuals and regions could be more
negatively affected by warming temperatures, but existing country-level analyses disagree on the source
of this disparity.3, 4 In particular, disparities in the impact of warming could occur because the poor are
more vulnerable to a given amount of warming, perhaps because they more often work in climate-sensitive
industries such as agriculture, or because they have fewer resources (e.g. savings) to buffer against negative
shocks. Alternatively, rich and poor could have the same underlying vulnerability to warming described by
a common non-linear response function, but could have different baseline temperature exposures that result
in different marginal damages when temperatures rise (Fig 3a-b). In the former case, economic development
on its own would be expected to reduce future climate damages in poor countries, while in the latter case it
would not. Thus distinguishing exposure from vulnerability as sources of disparity in impacts is central to
understanding the magnitude and distribution of climate impacts.7
We find that global disparities in the aggregate economic impacts of warming are more likely to be driven by

4

differences in temperature exposures rather than in underlying vulnerabilities. In both our 37-country sample
(Fig 3c) and in a separate non-overlapping sample of developing countries for which we have cross-sectional
household-level wealth data (Fig S9a), we find strong differences in temperature exposure by income level,
with poorer districts being disproportionately very cold or (particularly) very hot. However, this relationship
is mainly driven by differences in exposure between countries rather than within them; average cross-sectional
relationships within countries are still concave but much weaker (Fig 3d and Fig S9b). This weaker withincountry gradient is consistent with drivers of economic convergence between rich and poor regions – for
instance, government transfer programs, or the mobility of factors of production such as labor, capital, or
ideas – being stronger within countries than between them.19
To assess differences in vulnerability, we assign each district in our data to its quintile in the global income
distribution, and study whether temperature-growth responses to differ by quintile (SI Section 2). At most
exposures, estimated responses in each quintile are not statistically different than the pooled global response,
although results for individual quintiles are noisier and somewhat sensitive to how quintiles are defined (Fig
S10-S11). As another approach, we restrict the analysis to the US, where our dataset consists of 380 US
metropolitan areas endowed with a wide range of average temperatures but all falling into the top income
quintile in our global sample. In this sample of very wealthy cities, the estimated response function is again
noisier but nearly indistinguishable from the pooled global response.
Why might income not be effective in moderating economic responses to temperature? While our data do
not allow specific insight into the channels that mediate the economic responses we measure, a host of recent
micro-level evidence suggests that temperature can negatively impact key economic inputs even in highly
industrialized and climate-protected environments. These include impacts on cognitive function,20, 21 labor
and total factor productivity,22, 23 and various aspects of health, including mental health.24 While certain
protections (e.g. air conditioning) have been shown to moderate impacts for some outcomes,25 they do not
appear effective in insulating broader economic output from the negative effects of hot temperatures.
To understand whether our estimated responses actually reflect persistent effects of temperature on output
(“growth effects”), or conversely whether regions ‘catch up’ after a temporary increase in temperature (“level
effects”), we take two approaches. Following pioneering earlier work,3 we first estimate distributed lag
models that allow a given temperature shock to affect output in both current and ensuing years (see SI).
Estimates from these models suggest similarly shaped but substantially steeper responses as compared to
panels with just contemporaneous temperature (Fig S8, Table S4), albeit with a slightly warmer implied
optimal temperature.
Our second approach also builds on earlier literature26 and uses the large number of cross-sectional units in
our data to isolate the influence of longer-term temperature trends on output. Simple plots of the raw data
suggest that, in most countries, districts that have warmed the fastest since 2000 have grown on average much
more slowly than districts that have warmed the slowest (Fig 4a-l). For instance, districts in the top decile of
warming in India, Indonesia, Brazil, and China have per capita GDP (GDPc) that have grown a remarkable

5

56, 30, 12, and 37% less on average since 2000 as compared to districts in the bottom decile of warming.
The raw decile comparison for the US does not show this relationship, but this comparison is made off of a
very small number of metropolitan areas (14 in each decile); comparisons using all US data suggests faster
warming districts did grow more slowly (Fig 4g), but estimates there are somewhat noisy as well.
To quantify these effects of longer-term warming across the full sample, for each district we regress the time
series of GDPc and temperature variables on a time trend, and then estimate a long-differences regression of
trend in GDPc versus trend in temperature (and trend in temperature squared, for non-linear versions). That
is, we estimate:
Yistd = αisd + λisd yeart + εistd

(2)

Tist = αis + φis yeart + εist

(3)

2
Tist
= αis + φis2 yeart + εist

(4)

where Yistd is log GDPc and Tist is annual temperature in district i in admin-1 region s and year t and income
dataset d. To estimate these trends, we restrict ourselves to districts with at least 10 years of data (which is
>10,300 districts, or 93% of our full sample). We then estimate the long differences regression:
λˆisd = β1 φˆis + β2 φˆis2 + ηs + ρd + isd

(5)

where s indexes admin-1 regions/states and d indexes unique dataset used by each district i. To account
for time-trending unobservables at the state level, and for the fact that GDP data are often derived from
different datasets within the same country, we include both state fixed effects ηs , which remove statespecific average trends in either income or temperature, as well as dataset fixed effects ρd , which account
for any dataset-specific differences in income trends. The model also includes trends in precipitation and
precipitation squared, estimated as for temperature in equations 3 and 4. The identifying assumption in
equation 5 is that temperature trends at the district level are uncorrelated with other factors that affect trends
in economic activity, once state-level trends are accounted for. One concern is that emissions of pollutants
could be correlated with both local economic activity and temperature. While this is not true for long-lived
greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2 ), which are rapidly mixed in the atmosphere, it could be true for short-lived
pollutants such as particulate matter, which are emitted locally due to increased economic activity and also
can block sunlight which leads to cooling. In this latter case, economic activity could generate cooling,
leading us to spuriously attributed higher output to cooler temperatures. To address this concern, we process
high-resolution satellite-based particulate matter estimates for all our districts back to 2000, using data from
ref,27 estimate the trend in PM over time as in equation 3 for temperature, and include this trend in the
regression in equation 5.
As in the panel growth model, estimates from equation 5 – the marginal effects of which are shown in (Fig
4m) – suggest a nonlinear relationship between warming and income. Point estimates for the entire sample

6

are negative, suggesting that districts that warmed faster uniformly grew more slowly. Results are robust to
the inclusion of particulate matter trends, and do not appear driven by any one country or the EU, and are
robust to inclusion or dropping of growth outliers (Fig S12).
Our long difference estimates are not immediately comparable to our panel estimates: the former regresses
change in log GDPc on change in temperature, and the latter regresses change in log GDPc on temperature in
levels. To make units comparable, we use estimates from equation 1 and 5 to compute the district-level change
in income that each model would estimate to have occurred in response to the warming trend estimated in
equation 3. For the long differences model, given a sample length of n years, log GDPc would be estimated to
change by ∆Y LD = (βˆ1 φˆis + βˆ2 φˆis2 ) ∗ n. For the panel model, we first estimate the detrended temperature
i

series T˜it = Tit − φ̂i yeart using the estimates from equation 3 above. We then use the panel response f (.)
estimated in equation 1 to estimate the growth decrement (or increment) in each year due to the warming,
and then sum these log changes across years to get the total change in log income as estimated by the panel
P
model, i.e. ∆Y P = n f (T˜it ) − f (Tit ). We then compare ∆Y LD to ∆Y P . Results from this exercise

(shown in Fig 4n) suggest that, if anything, short-run panel estimates understate the impact of longer-term
warming. These results provide strong evidence that hot years have large and persistent effects on output and
that these impacts become increasingly negative at warmer baseline average temperatures.
Finally, we use our data to estimate the impact of recent historical warming on the level and distribution
of per-capita GDP, focusing on the subset of countries in our sample with data back to 2000. Using our
(substantially) more conservative panel estimates, we simulate how much slower or faster each district would
have grown in each year over the 2000-2015 period had temperature stayed at its 1951-2000 average, and
cumulate these effects over the period to calculate the increase or decrease in total output (Fig 5a-b). Our
exercise is similar to comparison with the long differences estimates above, but here we focus warming above
long-run historical average rather than very recent (post-2000) warming; this distinction is relevant given
substantial warming that occurred throughout much of the world in the second half of the twentieth century.
We find that recent warming has likely reduced output in most districts in our sample, with substantial
negative impacts (> 10% losses) in most tropical districts as well as in warmer temperate districts (Fig 5e-h).
However, given weak average temperature-income gradients within countries, we do not find consistent
evidence across our sample that recent warming has amplified within-country inequality (Fig 5i); increases
in inequality in some countries (e.g. the US) are offset by modest declines in others (e.g. Indonesia).
Cumulative overall impacts are nevertheless large at the country level, with recent warming having cost both
the US and the EU >$4 trillion in cumulative lost output (Fig 5j).
While it is unknown whether the response functions we estimate can be accurately extrapolated to other
districts or countries not in our sample, the consistency of the estimated response when countries are
analyzed independently or held out of the pooled estimation, and the similarity in response across income
quintiles, suggests our estimates might be globally relevant. If this is true, then the global impact of additional
warming might be more negative than past estimates based on country data,4 given no clear evidence in the

7

subnational data of positive effects in cooler regions. Similarly, because wealthier regions do not appear less
vulnerable to additional warming, we find no strong evidence to support the notion that future economic
development will protect economies from the impacts of warming – a key assumption in some integrated
assessment models.28 While it remains the case that unprecedented future adaptation could lessen climate
impacts, for example through the invention of novel climate-protective technologies, such technologies did
not appear to emerge during the substantial warming of recent decades.

Data Construction
GDP Data

We gathered subnational data on GDP per capita or GDP and population from national statistical agencies
which publicly provide these data in any formats, digitized or non-digitized. We obtained data at the most
granular level available, usually at the second-level administrative division (“districts”) of each country. First
we started by accessing the statistical agency website of every country in the world in alphabetical order. Then
we selected the GDP per capita data that were available in all districts in the majority of states of a country,
have growth rates within 97.5% of those in all available sample (Fig S3d-e), and pass the nightlights validation
test (Section 1.1.1). Despite national variations in the naming convention of administrative units, we use the
all-encompassing terms “state” and “district” for the first and second-level administrative divisions of each
country. Table S1 lists the data source for each country in our dataset, the number of available district-year
observations, and if we processed the data originally contained in non-digitized documents and spreadsheets.
In the discussion below, we refer to the European Union as a country.
We fluidly use the district definition for three countries. China’s statistical agencies provide more granular
GDP per capita data at the third-level administrative division. We use these data and assign the provinces in
which districts reside as their parent states. United States only has four-year prototype GDP per capita data
for the universe of districts,29 so the GDP per capita of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) serve as US’
most disaggregated subnational accounting. We assign the first state mentioned in the name of interstate
MSA as its parent state. Lastly, we follow European Union Statistics’ second-level divisions (NUTS 3) which
match imperfectly with member countries’ official second-level administrative units.
Except for GDP per capita data from US, Europe and Indonesia, data from all other countries were assembled
from multiple sources. All districts in Brazil experienced a switch in data source because data were contained
in two separate files. Similarly, Colombia experienced a switch in data source from CEDE Panel Municipal
to DANE. China had used different measures of national accounting before 1989/1990: "社会总产值"
(Total Social Output Value) or "工农业总产值" (Gross Value of Industrial and Agricultural Output). To
account for changes in growth rates that were caused by the idiosyncratic nature of dataset switches and
measurement changes, we include data source fixed effects in our regression analyses. When we collapsed
the panel data into a cross-section of districts in the long-difference analysis, the data source fixed effects is
the concatenation of all data sources across years used in each district.
As district level growth rates, particularly in China, have extreme outliers (Fig S3d-e), our baseline model
trims the 2.5% tails in the growth distribution of our global sample. We attempted alternative approaches to

dealing with growth outliers, such as trimming the 0.5%, 1% tails, or top- and bottom-coding observations
at said percentiles, and results were not very sensitive to this choice (Fig S3c).
Finally, in order to spatially merge per capita GDP growth rate with weather data, we performed string
merging of districts and their corresponding shapefiles on names or alternative names in case of district
name changes. In order to achieve the most balanced panel of districts over time, districts that split or merged
are aggregated to their largest unions and these unions are kept constant over the sample period. These
districts are usually observable in the data by having missing data before they split from parent districts or
after they merged with other districts. We obtained a list of territorial/name changes from Statoids93 and the
Chinese Government.94 Table S2 reports data source of shapefiles. Any remaining errors in our merging
will likely amplify noise in our assignment of temperature to districts, attenuating regression estimates.

Data Validation

As one check on data quality, we follow Henderson et al12 and compare our trimmed subnational GDP data
with data on satellite-derived night-time lights. We obtained district night-time lights observations by taking
area-weighted average of the digital numbers of stable light pixels96 within a district. Similar to Henderson
et al, we run a regression which absorbs time-invariant and time-trending observables that affect economic
productivity within a state in a country:
Yistd = β1 Iist + X0ist γ + αi + ρd + ηst + εist
where Yist measures the natural logarithm of GDP of district i in state s in year t with dataset d, Iist is
log average digital number of night-time lights, and Xist is a vector of controls as used in Henderson et al
to account for the spatial distribution of night-time lights (number of pixels with maximum digital number
(top-coded), minimum digital number (unlit), and the Gini index of light distribution). Figure S2 plots the
β1 coefficients from pooling all countries into one regression as well as from running a separate regression
for each individual country. Ecuador did not pass the nightlights validation test (β1 = −0.229) and has been
removed from the final dataset.

1.2

Weather Data

Our main annual average temperature data are derived from Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST)9
gridded data at 1◦ resolution. We use two additional temperature datasets at different resolutions, namely
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ ERA-Interim11 at 0.75◦ resolution and University
of East Anglia’s CRU TS 4.0110 at 0.5◦ resolution, as checks of robustness to our main results. Because
the temporal resolution of the three temperature datasets is monthly, we first took an area-weighted average
of temperature pixels within each district and then took an average across twelve months to get the annual
temperature values. Only in India’s GDP per capita dataset did subnational accounting follow a fiscal year
(April 1-March 31) and so annual average temperatures for Indian districts are computed from April to

18

March, while all other districts follow January to December annual average temperature. Our precipitation
data come from University of East Anglia’s CRU TS 4.01 data.10 Finally, as a robustness to our temperature
measurement, we also used number of ◦ C days that fell into a given set of intervals (or “bins") in a year to
measure temperature variation, the data for which came from daily BEST gridded data.9

1.3

Simulating the consequences of aggregation

To better understand and illustrate the gains from having sub-national granular data on both output and
temperature, we show how patterns of spatial correlation in local temperature anomalies can lead to noisy
inference in country level data. In particular, after taking out temperature trends, historical temperature
anomalies across the largest metropolitan in the US are often negatively correlated, and the same is true in
many other regions (Fig S1a-b). To see the implication of these negative correlations for country-aggregated
data, consider two years which at the country level had the same output and same average temperature: one
year in which temperature and output were normal in both the East and West, and another in which the
temperature (output) was high (low) in the East and low (high) in the West. This second year, while showing
strong local responses to temperature, would show no aggregate response at the country level, and would not
contribute variation to our understanding of temperature’s effects on output (nor, importantly, would it bias
our understanding; it would simply not provide information).
To quantitatively explore these implications, we run the following simulation. We define the true response
of growth to temperature at the district level as yit = β1 Tit + β2 Tit2 + ψt + it , using the detrended observed
Tit time series in each district i and setting β1 = 0.02, β2 = −0.001. ψt ∼ N (0, 2) is a common growth
shock in each year and it ∼ N (0, 2) is a district specific shock. We then use these constructed outcomes
and observed temperatures to estimate a district fixed effects regression
yit = β1 Tit + β2 Tit2 + αi + δt + εit

(6)

P
then save the coefficient estimates on temperature. We then generate growth aggregates yt = i yit , and
P
P
temperature aggregates Tt = i Tit and Tt2 = i Tit2 . We then run the time series regression at the country
level:
yt = γ1 Tt + γ2 Tt2 + θ ∗ yeart + εt

(7)

where θ ∗ yeart is a country time trend. We again save the coefficient estimates on temperature. We repeat
this process 1000 times.
In Figure S1c, black lines give responses estimated using the district data, and red lines give the estimated
response from the country time series. Panels (d) and (e) show distribution of parameter estimates across
bootstraps for the district panel model (black lines) and the aggregated country model (red lines). Aggregated
country-level estimates are unbiased but much noisier that district estimates and can get the sign of the

19

true effect wrong. In essence, given the structure of temperature anomalies in our data, aggregation can
substantially reduce the variation that can be learned from. Our district-level data are able to leverage
variation that country aggregates cannot.

2

Estimation

Our main panel fixed effects regression is given in the main text (Equation 1). To study quintile-specific
responses, we interact the temperature response function with quintile dummies:
yistd =

X

Dj ∗ [f (Tist ) + f (Pist )] + ρd + αi + ηst + εistd

(8)

j

where Dj is an indicator for whether district i falls into the j-th quintile.
To study whether effects of temperature on growth are persistent, or whether there is “catch up" in the next
period, we follow refs3, 4 and estimate a distributed lag model and include up to five years of temperature or
precipitation lags:
yistd =

5
X

[f (Tis(t−L) ) + f (Pis(t−L) )] + ρd + αi + ηst + εist

(9)

L=0

with persistence assessed by adding up the contemporaneous and lagged coefficients. That is, with f (Tist ) =
2 , then the marginal effect of a degree of warming is:
β1 Tist + β2 Tist

We also estimate a long-differences regression as described in the main text.

Calculating the cost of recent warming

To understand the cost of recent warming, we combine our panel estimates from equation 1 of the marginal
impact of warming with how much annual temperatures in each district-year differed from their long-term
(1951-2000) average. Using our panel estimates, we simulate how much slower or faster each district would
have grown in each year over the 2000-2015 period had temperature stayed at its 1951-2000 average, and
cumulate these effects over the period to calculate the increase or decrease in total output (Fig 5a-b) We
emphasize that our estimates are agnostic to the cause of recent warming, and do not necessarily represent
the impact of recent anthropogenic warming.

20

To calculate the cumulative cost of warming for each district we first compute the annual cost of warming
from 1951-2000 baseline level:
2

cit = (β1 Tit + β2 Tit2 ) − (β1 T i + β2 T i )

(11)

where Tit is the observed temperature of district i in year t, T it is its average temperature over baseline years
of 1951-2000, and β1 and β2 are our coefficient estimates for the effects of temperature on growth rate from
Equation 1. Thus absent warming, district i’s counterfactual growth rate and income in year t could be
ŷit = yit + cit
Ŷit = Yit−1 + ŷit

(12)

where hatted terms are counterfactual and Y indicates GDP per capita in log terms, and yit is the observed
growth rate. The cumulative loss in GDP for district i is then
LOSSi =

X

Nit (eŶit − eYit )

(13)

t∈Θ

where Nit is the population of district i in year t and the sum is computed over all available years Θ in our
sample. We focus on the four countries/regions with data back to 2001: the US, EU, Brazil, and Indonesia.

using the country time series. (d) and (e) show distribution of parameter estimates across bootstraps
for the district panel model (black lines) and the aggregated country model (red lines). Aggregated
country-level estimates are unbiased but much noisier that district estimates and can get the sign of
the true effect wrong.

rebound after a transitory, hotter than normal year, we compare our baseline model with no

temperature as well as five year lags in temperature (b). Dark blue lines are bootstrapped estimates

Figure S9: Cross-sectional relationship between household wealth and temperature is negative
across full sample but flat within countries. To confirm that our exposure disparity in Figure 3
is representative, we assemble geo-referenced cross-sectional data on household asset wealth from
36 developing countries (non overlapping with our sample countries in the main analysis) from
the Demographic and Health Surveys, and match these wealth measures to average temperature
exposure at each household’s location. Households with less asset wealth are much more likely
to be exposed to warmer average temperatures when looking across all households in the global
sample (a), but this disparity is much weaker when looking only within countries (b).

to bright orange (richest). (a) is our main specification in which income quintile is assigned to
a district relative to the global sample when it enters our dataset and is fixed throughout. (b) is
the specification in which income quintile may change over time, moving depending on districts’
relative position in a given year’s distribution. We control for time-trending and time-invariant
observables that may affect temperature and growth rate separately in each quintile by including
quintile-year fixed effects in (a) and (b), whereas (c) and (d) are the fixed and moving quintile
specifications without the quintile-year fixed effects. All responses are fairly similar except for the
poorest quintiles in (c).

specification in Figure S10, we compute the marginal effect of change in growth rate per ◦ C change
at a given temperature. (a) is our main specification using fixed quintile and quintile-year fixed
effects. (b) is the specification with moving quintile and quintile-year fixed effects. (c) and (d) are
the fixed and moving quintile specifications without quintile-year fixed effects.

Notes: Table reports the coefficients of the regressions of district GDP per capita growth rate on quadratic annual
average temperature. Our baseline specification is reported in panel A using BEST weather temperature on column 1.
The included time controls in each specification are shown at the bottom of the table. Column 3 controls for state
time-trend, with year fixed effects. Column 4 controls for quadratic state time-trend. Asterisks indicate the level of
statistical significance: ∗ p<0.1; ∗∗ p<0.05; ∗∗∗ p<0.01
