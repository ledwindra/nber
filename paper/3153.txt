YIELD SPREADS AD INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS: A BIRD S EYE VIEW
AM TRACT

The expectations theory of the term structure implies that the spread
between a longer-term interest rate and a shorter-term interest rate
forecasts two subsequent interest rate changes: the change in yield of
the longer-term bond over the life of the shorter-term bond, and a
weighted average of the changes in shorter-tenu rates over the life of

the longer-term bond. For postwar U.S. data from Mcculloch [1987] and
just about any combination of maturities between one month and ten years
we find that the former relation is not borne out by the data, the latter

roughly is. When the yield spread is high the yield on the longer-term
bond tends to fall, contrary to the expectations theory; at the same
time, the shorter-term interest rate tends to rise, just as the

expectations theory requires. We discuss several possible
interpretations of these findings. We argue that they are consistent
with a model in which the spread is a multiple of the value implied by

the expectations theory. This model

could be

generated by time-varying

risk premia which are correlated with expected increases in short-term
interest rates, or by a failure of rational expectations in our sample
period.

1. Introduction

Does the slope of the term structure —

the yield spread between

longer-term and shorter-term interest rates —

predict

future changes in

interest rates? And if so, is the predictive power of the yield spread
in accordance with the expectations theory of the term structure?

These questions are important, both for forecasting interest rates and
for interpreting shifts in the yield curve. If the expectations theory
is an adequate description of the term structure then expectations of
future interest rates are the dominant force determining current long-

term interest rates. On the other hand, if the expectations theory is
very far from accurate, then predictable changes in excess returns must

be the main influence moving the ten structure. It makes sense to
thoroughly explore the validity of the simple expectations theory before
undertaking a detailed study of the sources of predictable time variation

in excess returns)
The literature on the term structure contains a bewildering variety of

answers to these questions. Almost all studies statistically reject the
expectations theory of the term structure; but some studies suggest that
the yield spread does predict interest rate movements in roughly the way
one would expect if the expectations theory is true, while other studies

Ingersoll, and Ross [19811 and others, we have however argued elsewhere
that these different expectations theories are in important respects very
similar, and are all closely approximated by a single linear expectations
theory (Shiller [1979], Shiller, Campbell, and Schoenholtz (1983]

rational expectations in our definition of the expectations theory. This

reach the opposite conclusion. Different studies use different
econometric niethods, test different implications of the expectations

theory, and look at different interest rate maturities.

In this paper we show that certain statements can be made quite

generally. For any pair of maturities n and m, where n exceeds m (so
is the "long-term" rate and rn is the "short-terw rate), the following is
true: When the spread between the n-period rate and the rn-period rate is

relatively high, the yield on the n-period bond tends to fall over the
life of the in-period bond. This runs counter to the expectations theory.
At the same tine, rn-period rates tend to rise over the life of the n-

period bond, in accordance with the expectations theory. in plain
English, when the spread is high the long rate tends to fall and the
short rate tends to rise.

The data set used here consists of continuously compounded yields on

riskless pure discount bonds. These yields were calculated by Mcculloch
(1.981) from raw data on U.S. Treasury bill, note and bond prices.

measured over the period 1952:l-lg87:2 at the end of each month.2 We
will present results for all possible pairs of maturities in the range 1,

2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 months and 1, 2. 3, 4, 5, and 10 years. Thus, the
results in this paper are a group of two-dimensional tables of

evaluations of the linear expectations theory. While the main findings
hold over all possible sets of maturities, there are some interesting
differences between the behavior of the short end of the term structure

from the period before the Treasury Accord of 1951.

(maturities less than one year) and the long end of the term structure

(maturities greater than one year). We discuss these further below.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we derive
the implications of the expectations theory of the term structure for the
relation between yield spreads and subsequent interest rate movements.
We discuss several ways in which these implications can be tested,

including regression methods and a modification of the vector

autoregressive approach of Campbell and Shiller 11987]. In section 3 we
apply these methods to the McCulloch term structure data. We also use a
Monte Carlo study to check the finite-sample properties of our

procedures. In section 4 we try to interpret our results further. We
argue that one simple alternative, in which the yield spread equals its
value under the expectations theory plus orthogonal. noise, is not

consistent with the data. We suggest another alternative, which makes
the yield spread a constant multiple of its value under the expectations

theory. This sodel could be generated by time-varying risk premia which
are correlated with expected increases in short-term interest rates,
by a failure of rational expectations in our sample period.

2. The Expectations Theory of the Term Structure
The expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates is a
and u-period

relationship between the n-period interest rate

where n/n is an integer. In the case of pure discount

bonds, as with our data here, this is:

Ic —

n/rn.

Equation U) states chat the n-period rate is a constant plus a simple
average of the current and expected future rn-period rates up

to n-rn —

of
(k-1)m periods in the future. Note that the sum of the coefficients

the rn-period interest rates is one. The parameter c reflects a term
premium, that is a predictable excess return on the n-period bond over
the rn-period bond. The term premium may vary with ii and n but is assumed
to be constant through time.

Equation (1) can be obtained directly if one assumes that

expected

continuously compounded yields to maturity on all discount bonds are
equal, up to a constant; this is the approach taken by Fama [19841.

Equation (1) can also be derived as a linear approximation to any of
several different nonlinear expectations theories of the term structure.
The

approximation is quite adequate for most purposes (Shiller, Campbell.

and Schoenholtz

119831. Campbell [1986]). For example, if one assumes

that the expected total return over a periods on buying an n-period bond
and selling it rn periods later equals the return on holding an rn-period

bond

to maturity plus a constant, then one finds that the expectation of

It should be noted that (I) is a time-consistent model, If the model
holds for rn—i and all n, then it holds for all in

1 and all n. This is

an important property of the model; many time series models (as for
example most ARIMA models) are not time consistent: an AR(2) model with
monthly data is not consistent with an AR(2) model with quarterly data.
There is no such problem here.

The spread as a forecast of chanzes in interest rates
Our purpose is Co state in the simplest possible terms what elements
of truth can be found in the expectations theory of the term structure.

We therefore concentrate our attention on the behavior through time of a
simple measure of the shape of the term structure: the spread between the
n-period rate and the rn-period rate,

The spread is

of course proportional to the slope of the term structure between in

and

The expectations theory of the term structure implies that the spread

rates.

We can test the model by regressing

the

appropriate

onto the spread and testing whether the coefficient equals one.

And we can, apart from testing the model, evaluate its usefulness by
checking to what extent the spread resembles an optimal forecast of the
changes in interest rates.

There are several ways to write the spread as a forecast of future

changes in interest rates. First, the spread predicts the m-period

change in yield on the longer-term bond. This bond has n periods to
maturity at time t, so it has n-rn periods to maturity at time t+m.

According to the expectations theory.

where for simplicity we are suppressing constant terms. The intuition
behind equation (2) is that if the yield on the n-period bond is expected
to rise over the next in periods, this will give a capital loss to holders

of the bond. To equate expected returns over m periods, the n-period
bond has to have a higher current yield than the rn-period instrument.

Second, by subtracting Rm) from both sides of equation (1) and
rearranging terms, one can show that the spread forecasts a weighted

The variable St

since it is the spread that would obtain given the model if there were

perfect foresight about future interest races. With perfect foresight
if rn-period rates are going to rise over the life of the n-period bond.
then the n-period yield needs to be higher than the current rn-period

yield to equate the returns on the n-period band, held to maturity, and a
sequence of rn-period bonds. Below we shall regress the perfect foresight
spread onto a constant and the actual spread to evaluate the model. The
slope coefficient should be one.

Equations (2) and (3) are complete characterizations of the
expectations theory of the term structure; if (2) holds for all m and n,

then (3) holds for all rn and n, and vice versa. However it is important
to note that for any particular values of m and n, the validity of (2)
does not generally imply the validity of (3) or vice versa.

An exception to this statement occurs when n — 2m, a case chat is

often studied in empirical work.3 In this case equations (2) and (3)

Equation (4) says that the spread equals the difference between the

optimal

forecast of the rn-period rate-rn periods from now and the n-

period rate today, while equation (5) says that the spread equals onehalf the optimal forecast of the change in the m-period rate over the

next m periods. If (4) holds for a particular m and n, then (5) must
also hold, and vice versa. (To see this. Just subtract Rm) from both
sides of (4) and rearrange.)

Since (4) and (5) are special cases of (2) and (3). they can be tested
using the same regression approach.

If the regression coefficient for

the test of (4) is written b, the regression coefficient for the test of
(5) will be (l+b)/2.

The theoretical spread
Regression tests of the expectations theory have the great merit of
simplicity. But they also have some serious disadvantages.

First, the

regression of the perfect foresight spread onto the actual spread

involves n-period overlapping errors. One only has an entirely
independent observation of the forecast power of the term structure every

n periods. While econometric methods are available to correct regression
standard errors for overlap, they do not work well, when the degree of

overlap is large relative to the sample size. (See for example Stock and
Richardson (19891.) since n can be as large as 10 years, and we have
only 35 years of data, this is a worrisouse problem.

Secondly, regression tests do not tell us how stalin are the
movements of the actual spread to the movements implied by the

B

expectations theory. We would like to evaluate the ability of the
expectations theory to explain the shape of the tern structure, and
regression tests are not well suited for this purpose.

In earlier work (Campbell and Shiller [1987]) we proposed a vector

autoregressive (VAR) approach for evaluating present value models. That
paper dealt with the case in which n is infinite, but the approach can

easily be modified to handle a finite value of n. The VAR approach

avoids the need to estimate regressions with overlapping errors. The VAR
includes the 1-period change in the rn-period interest rate, and the

actual yield spread. From the estimated VAR coefficients, one can
compute the optimal forecast of rn-period interest rate changes over any

horizon; the long-run behavior of interest rates is inferred from their
short-run behavior in the sample period, rather than being estimated

directly. The appropriate weighted average of forecast interest rate
changes (the "theoretical spread") can be calculated, and compared with

the actual spread. If the expectations theory is true, the two variables
should be the same.

The details of the VAR approach are given in Campbell and Shiller
fl98fl; here we merely suwnarize the method and show how we can apply it

to the expectations theory with a finite horizon n. We assume first of

negative. We concluded that the theory was very far off track, that the
expectations theory of the term structure is just wrong.5
In later work (Campbell and Shiller [1987]). we used a different
metric Co evaluate the expectations theory for large n and small in, and

we found that the expectations theory seemed to work fairly well. We
computed the correlation between (n.m) and 5t,m) and found it to be

quite high. This suggests that the actual spread behaves much as it
should according to the expectations model.6 The correlation between

(nm) and s;im) can be high and still we may get a wrong sign in a
regression test of equation (2); for example, this can happen if

According to the expectations theory, forward preinia should forecast

3. Data and Ernirical Results
The KcCul].och monthly term structure data [1987] give pure discount

(zero coupon) bond yields for U. S. Government securities over the period

1946:12-1987:2. We use the sample 1952:1-1987:2. to allow for lags and
to exclude data from before the Treasury Accord of 1951. The data
include maturities of 0. 1 2. 3. 4. 5, 6. and 9 months, and 1, 2. 3, 4
5, and 10 years. Longer maturities are available only for part of the
sample. These data are continuously compounded yields to maturity.
Of course, pure discount government bonds of long maturity do not

exist. But existing government bonds may be regarded as portfolios of
pure discount bonds, bonds maturing on all coupon dates and the maturity

date. One may suppose that they are priced, except for some tax
considerations, as the sum of the values of the constituent bonds in the

portfolio. One can therefore infer the prices (and thus the yields) of
the constituent bonds. There are problems in making this inference:
there may be more than one way to infer the yield of a certain discount

bond (giving possibly different answers in practice) and no way to infer
the yield of other discount bonds (since coupon and maturity dates may
not be evenly spaced through time). Thus, McCu].loch (19871 inferred the

discount yields by an interpolation method using cubic splines.8

McCullochs data are very clean in the sense that they are unaffected
by differing coupons, coupon dates, or differing compounding conventions

across maturities. They are ideally suited to the kind of analysis we
8

Fama and Bliss (1987] infer yields on pure discount bonds using
the assumption that instantaneous forward rates are step functions of
maturity. This is an alternative to McCulloch's procedure. Our results
below are similar to those of Fama and Bliss for the maturities they
consider.

Table la confirms that the slope of the term structure between almost
any two maturities (m and n, where n > m) gives the wrong direction of

the life of the shorter term (rn-period) bond.9

from one at conventional significance levels. Thus, earlier conclusions
in Shiller [1979] and Shiller, Campbell and $choenholtz (1983] for some
maturities are found to extend to just about all maturity pairs u

The general tendency for wrong signs to appear throughout the table is

robust to the sample period. In Table lb we report results for the case
m — 1 over a variety of subsamples, including the 1952-78 period (the
longest possible subsample which avoids the 1979 monetary policy regime

shift) and the shorter periods 1952-59. 1.960-69, 1970-78 and 1979-87. We
find a predominance of wrong signs in every period except 1952-59.

As a check on the McCulloch data, these results can be compared with
earlier results using different monthly data on U.S. Treasury

errors imply rejection of the expectations theory at conventional

significance levels. At the long end of the term structure, the
regression coefficients are very close to one and the expectations theory
is not rejected.

We thus see an apparent paradox: the slope of the term structure
almost always gives a forecast in the wrong direction for the short-term
change in the yield on the longer bond, but gives a forecast in the right
direction for long- term changes in short rates. We next use our VAR

procedures

in order to judge how the spread moves through time in

relation to an unrestricted forecast of changes in short rates.

the simple expectations model. Similar results hold in all subsamples

16

These results can be compared to results in table 2 in the following

way. The product of an element in Table 3a (the correlation of SLOIm)

There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, in

allow computation of s%,m)* which requires data n-rn periods into the

future. (For this reason we do not try to apply the approach of Table 2
in subsamples.) to do the calculations in Tables 3 and 4 there is no
such need to truncate the sample. Thus, the discrepancy in results might
just be due to different sample periods, and our estimates with shorter
samples in Tables 3b and 4b show that this is a large part of the
explanation.

A second possible reason for the discrepancy is that perhaps our
vector autoregression truncated after four months is too short, and thus

our estimate of Qm) is subject to error. In our previous work we
have suggested that long lags may be useful in forecasting interest rates

(Campbell and Shjfler (1984fl. When we increase the lag length to eight
months we find that the estimated standard deviation ratio is roughly
unchanged; the estimated correlation tends to fall, but is less precisely

estimated. Overall, the increase in lag length does not reduce the
discrepancy between the results in Table 2 and those in Tables 3 and 4.

17

The effect of the forecast horizon
Fama and Bliss [1987] have emphasized that the forecast power of the
term structure for changes in short rates improves as the forecast

horizon increases from 2 years to 5 years. Our study of the full range
of maturities confirms this result, but shows that in fact below 1. year

the forecast power deteriorates with the horizon. The forecast power
reaches its minimum at 9 to 12 months, and then starts to improve. This
effect can be seen in the "U-shaped" pattern of coefficients as one moves

down the first column of Table 2 Table 3a, or Table 4a. It is evident
also in most of the subsamples in Tables 3b and 4b.

The movements of longer-term yields, however, do not display this U-

shaped pattern. In Tables la and lb the coefficients become increasingly
negative as the horizon increases. The tendency of the long rate to fall
when the spread is high is quite robust to the maturity of the longerterm instrument.

Monte Carlo results

Our VAR approach can also be used to generate artificial data for

Monte Carlo simulations. It is known

that

there can be small-sample bias

in standard errors of regressions with predetermined but not exogenous

variables. (See Kankiw and Shapiro (19861 and Stambaugh (19861 for a
discussion of this in the context of rational expectations models.) The
problem is particularly serious when asymptotic corrections are used to
handle equation error overlap which is large relative to the sample size

(Stock and Richardson (19891). Monte Carlo simulations are an appealing
way to avoid excessive reliance on asywptotic distribution theory.

18

To generate data which match the moments of the actual data while
obeying the restrictions of the expectations theory, we start by drawing
normal random errors and feeding them through the VAR system estimated on

the actual data. This gives us artificial time series for apm) and
We then replace

5(n,m)

with s;m), calculated using the true

VAR coefficients (those estimated on the actual data and which generate
the artificial, data). This procedure can be used whenever n/rn is an
integer.

It gives us artificial data which obey the expectations theory

in population, but not necessarily in each artificial sample.

Tables La, 2a, 3a, and 4 give two numbers for each entry which
suw.marize the results of the Monte Carlo experiment. The first number is
the fraction of 1000 runs which produced an estimated regression
coefficient (or correlation, or standard deviation ratio) which was
further away from one in the same direction (that is, usually, smaller)

than the coefficient obtained in the data. This is a "one-sided"
empirical significance level for the coefficient. The second number is
the fraction of 1000 runs in which a t

test

of the expectations theory,

computed using the asymptotic standard error on the coefficient, rejected
the null more strongly than the t

test

on the actual data. This is a

"two-sided' empirical significance level for the expectations theory t

test.

One can compare the empirical significance level with the

significance Level from the normal distribution to evaluate the quality
of the asymptotic standard errors in the tables.

The Monte Carlo results show that there is some finite-sample bias in

asymptotically valid regression tests of the expectations theory. The
bias is particularly noticeable when the order of equation error overlap

19

is Large (that is, for large in on the right hand side

of Table 1 and for

Large n at the bottom of Table 2). In these parts of the tables, the
asymptotic standard errors greatly understate the true uncertainty about
the regression coefficients.

However this bias is not enough to overturn our conclusions about the

expectations theory. In Table I the expectations theory is rejected very
strongly at the short end, and comfortably at the long end.

In Table 2

the theory is rejected at the short end but not the long end. The VAR

procedures generally give weak evidence that the actual and theoretical
spreads are imperfectly correlated, and stronger evidence

that the actual

spread has higher variability than the theoretical spread.
One interesting feature of the Monte Carlo results is that the two
empirical significance levels are sometimes quite different from one

another. For example, in Table 3a with rn—I and n—24, only 21 out of 1000

runs delivered a correlation between 1m) and

that was lower

than the one estimated in the data. But 749 out of 1000 runs delivered a
correlation which was further from one when normalized by its asymptotic

standard error. In this table, it seems that the artificial data sets
tended to deliver higher correlations between sh1m) and
smaller
that

standard errors than are found in the

and

actual data. We conjecture

this J.s due to heteroskedasticity in the actual data which is not

captured by our Monte Carlo experiment.

20

4. Further tnteroretatiofl

We have documented the fact that for any pair of maturities the yield
spread fails to correctly predict subsequent movements in the yield on
the Longer term bond, yet it does forecast short rate movements in

roughly the way implied by the expectations theory. The purpose of this
section is to explore some possible explanations for this fact. The
explanations we will consider are not finance-theoretic models of time-

varying risk premia, but simply econometric descriptions of ways in which
the expectations theory might fail.

One obvious alternative to the expectations theory is a model of the
form

where v is an er-or term which is orthogonal to E4tm)*. Equation (8)
can generate a negative coefficient when

variable and negatively in the dependent variable of this regression.
Equation (8) also implies that the regression coefficient when

The VAR

results

in Tables 3 and 4 do not suggest that this model fits

the data, since we found that the correlation coefficient was very close

21

Co one whLle the ratio of standard deviations was roughly one half. It
is also possible to test (8) more directly, if we impose extra

orthogonality conditions on the error term v. For example, if we assume
that v is white noise then any variables dated t-l or earlier can be
used as instruments in an instrumental variables regression of

These lagged variables will be orthogonal to

so the IV coefficient should be one as implied by the expectations

theory. Alternatively if we assume that v follows an MA(q)

process.

then any variables dated t-q-t or earlier can be used as instruments.
In Table 5 we report the results of instrumental variables regressions
of

For coinparLson, the first column reports the OLS regression

results from Table la.

The next three columns give IV regression

coefficients with standard errors, where the instruments are the spread

lagged 1 month. 6 months, and 12 months respectively. The results are
not encouraging for the model (8); the IV coefficients are always
negative and often more so than the 01.3 coefficients. Standard errors
increase with the lag length of the instrument, but this does not provide
any positive evidence in favor of

An alternative orthogonality condition would be that v is orthogonal
to current and past short-term interest rates. If this is so, then the
projection of the yield spread onto the history of short rates has the
form implied by the expectations theory; the failure of the expectations
theory is caused by the behavior of the error term in this projection.

10

These results are consistent with those reported in Campbell and
Shiller (1987] using a VM approach to test (8).
22

We can test this idea by using current and lagged short rates as
instruments in the IV regression of

these variables as

instrument for shorter-term yield spreads, while tt 60 is a better

instrument for longer-term yield spreads. But neither set of results is
very encouraging for the model. At least over the period 1952-87, it
appears that the component of the yield spread which is correlated with
past short rates is at least partly responsible for the failure of the
11

expectations theory.
These results suggest that equation (8) may be too restrictive to

explain the data. A more promising Model may be

1.1

We analyzed this question earlier in Campbell and SMIler (1984)
Using a different approach, we reached a similar conclusion for the
period 1959-82. Over the period 1959.79, however, we found no evidence
against equation (9) with an error term orthogonal to short rates.
Indeed an IV regression of the type reported in the last column of Table
5 does give some positive coefficients over the shorter sample period,
but the standard errors are quite large.
23

regression coefficients tend to exceed the Table 4 standard deviation
ratios for long horizons.

Equation (9) could be described as an overreaction model of the yield

spread. It says that the long rats differs from the short rate in the
direction implied by the expectations theory; however, the spread between
the two rates is larger than can be justified by rational expectations of
future short rate changes.

An alternative way to describe equation (9) is to say that long rates

underreact to short-term interest rates. This interpretation was offered
in Campbell and Shiller [1984], although the empirical results in that

paper were not as comprehensive as those here. We argued there that long
rates are fairly well described as a distributed lag on short rates,
where the distributed lag weights are all positive and their sum is very

close to one. (It should be exactly one if predictable excess returns
are stationary and the short-term interest rate follows a stochastic

process with a unit root.) Relative to the predictions of the
expectations theory the estimated distributed lag gives too little
weight to the current short rate, and too much weight to tagged short

rates. In this sense the long rate underreacts to the current level of

the short rate)2

12

Mankiw and Summers [1984) described a similar underreaction model
in which the long rate gives too much weight to exoected future short
rates, as opposed to lagged short rates. The underreaction story is not
what one would expect given the evidence for "excess volatility" of long
rates presented by one of the authors (Shiller (1979)). However that
evidence depended on the assumption that the short-term interest rate is
stationary, which is probably inappropriate for the postwar period in the
U.S. See Shiller (1989) for further discussion.
24

To see that the Campbell and Shiller [1984] model is consistent with
our results here, consider its implications for the spread between the

long rate and the short rate. The spread will be a distributed lag on
past short rates with negative weight on the current short rate and
positive weight on the distributed lag of past short rates, where all

weights sum to zero. The Campbell and Shiller [1984] model implies that
the spreads distributed lag representation would conform more closely to
the expectations theory if the absolute value of all weights were scaled

down towards zero. This also follows from equation
The deviation from the expectations theory described by equation (9)

could be caused by tine-varying risk premia which are correlated with

expected increases in short-term interest rates. Alternatively, it is
possible that in our sample period the bond market underestimated the

persistence of movements in short rates (and thus overestimated the

predictability of future short rate changes). Variations in the longshort spread were due primarily to sudden movements in short rates, and
in

this sample period long rates reacted too sluggishly to these sudden

movements, so that the
large

consequential movements in the spread were too

to be in accordance with the expectations theory.

13

is stronger in that it

implies that the component of
Equation (9)
spread which is orthogonal to current and lagged short rates should
also be scaled down.

to 1987:2. Since computation of 5,m)* requires data extending n-rn periods
into the future, the sample in the regression ends n-a months before 1987:2.

The table also gives, in ordinary type, two numbers from a Monte Carlo

experiment. These are constructed in the same way as the Monte Carlo results
reported in Table la.

The first number is the fraction of 1000 runs in which the difference between

the estimated correlation and one was larger than in the actual data. The
second number is the fraction of 1000 runs in which the difference between the
estimated correlation and one, divided by its standard error, was larger than
