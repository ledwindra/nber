More than 200 billion dollars have been invested in Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) since their creation in 1974.

By 1986,

annual

IRA contributions were 38 billion dollars, and the saving incentive
enjoyed tremendously popularity with the public.
IRAs may have drawn to a close.

But the golden age of

Since the curtailment of IRA eligibility

following the 1986 tax reform, enrollment has fallen by more than 50
percent.' Despite the 1986 tax reform, IRAs may rise again; they remain
popular among politicians for purposes as diverse as housing, education,
and medical expenses.
The original intent of the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security
Act was to encourage workers without pensions to save for their
retirement.

The broadening of eligibility to all taxpayers, and the

increased limits on deductions in 1982,

signaled a new objective for IRAs;

to stimulate overall saving and capital formation, as well as to
supplement retirement and pension income.

How successful have been IRAs

in fulfilling the objective of stimulating aggregate saving?

In 1986, IRA

deposits were 29 percent of personal saving.2 If IRA contributions
represent new saving,

they were partially successful at stemming the

decline in personal saving during the 1980s.3
new saving.

But IRAs may not represent

There are strong incentives for taxpayers to shift assets

from taxable investments such as money market accounts into the untaxed
IRAs.

At the extreme, taxpayers could borrow money to open an IRA, and

deduct the interest payments and initial contribution. In these cases,

2

IRks would not represent new saving; rather,

they would allow wealthy

taxpayers to shuffle their portfolio into the tax-favored IRAs,

reduce

their tax liability, and cause a substantial loss in tax revenue to the
Treasury.

That is, IRks could have reduced aggregate saving by

exacerbating the already large budget deficit with no offsetting increase
in private saving.
The potential for tax arbitrage was recognized before eligibility was
broadened.

Feldstein and Feenberg (1983) showed that few taxpayers had

sufficient taxable assets to purchase IRks for more than one or two years;
further IRA purchases would have to be financed either by reducing current
consumption or by borrowing.

A number of Washington officials had little

doubt how IRAs would be financed. At the 1980 House hearings on saving
incentives, Donald Lubick from the Treasury testified that "...you have
the

...

possibility

of gaming the system through borrowing and taking

interest deductions and putting the borrowed money into the tax-deferred
account." (U.S. House, 1980; p.5)

During the 1985 Senate hearings on tax

reform, Daniel Halperin of Georgetown Law School revealed the source of
his IRA:

I was going to answer [Senator Bradley's] question about where
I can tell you where it comes

from in my case.
It comes from borrowing...
And since you get the interest deduction on that borrowing, in
effect you get the tax benefits without having any retirement saving
at all.... (U.S. Senate, 1985; page 91).

Financial advisors were not slow to understand the benefits of tax
arbitrage with IRks.

much different view comes from recent economic studies of saving

and IRA

purchases.

Hubbard (1984) and Venti and Wise (1986; l987a, l987b)

found strong evidence from economic cross-section survey data that IRA5
represent new saving.

Supporting evidence comes from Carroll and Summers

(1987), who suggest that the generous Canadian personal saving incentives

are a plausible explanation for why Canadian saving rates have recently
increased above those in the United States.

However, given the difficulty

of comparing aggregate saving rates between countries (Carroll and

and Wise), the question of whether IRAs are tax dodges for the wealthy, or
a tremendously successful saving incentive, has not been resolved.

available.
Economic studies of why taxpayers buy 1RAs typically explain

5

contributions as

a

function of variables such as income, wealth, and

marginal tax rates.

Optimizing agents contribute to IRAs (often to the

legal limit) owing to the high rate of return on their saving.

Our

results, however, suggest that this view of enrollees as rational
optimizers may be incomplete. First, taxpayers seem to have only a dim
awareness of their legal limits for IRA contributions. Of the 14 million
taxpayers who contributed to an IRA in 1985, 5.5 million taxpayers
eligible to contribute between $2250 and $4000 saved exactly $2000.

Had

these taxpayers contributed up to their legal limit, they would have saved

$10.5 billion more.

Why $2000?

Perhaps the advertisements for IRAs

common during the early l980s conveyed not only (correct) information
about the high rates of return available from IRAs, but also (incorrect)
information that $2000 was the family's maximum limit.
Our second piece of evidence that casts doubt on the traditional
economic model is that taxpayers who owe the IRS money in excess of taxes
withheld ---

are

i.e.,

taxpayers who must write the IRS a check on April 14th

more likely to purchase IRAs, holding constant income, wealth, and

other economic factors.

This result implies that taxpayers would prefer

to write a $2000 check to their IRA account than to write an $800 check to
the IRS.

In this sense, IRAs encourage capital formation by providing

psychological as well as economic incentives to save.
The beneficiaries of Individual Retirement Accounts were largely
upper-middle-class and wealthy families.

In 1986, the top 9 percent of

taxpayers (with adjusted gross income in excess of $50,000) accounted for
41 percent of IRA purchases and one-third of enrollees. While IRAs may
have promoted aggregate saving, they had little impact on the majority of

6

taxpayers.

II.

The Tax Benefits of IRAs
The most visible benefit of IRAs is the tax deductibility of the

contribution.

Although the principal is taxed when it is withdrawn from

the IRA, the marginal tax rate is often low when the IRA is cashed out
during retirement.

Beginning in 1987, this benefit has been curtailed for

higher income taxpayers.

For those with existing pension arrangenents,

the limits on deductible contributions are gradually reduced at incomes
above $40,000 (for married couples) until they are phased out at $50,000.
to make
Employees without qualified pension arrangements may continue
contributions regardless of income levels.
Another benefit of IRAs which remains available for all enrollees is
the ability to defer paying taxes on accumulated interest until the IRA is
withdrawn.

Over a sufficient period of time, this second aspect can

deferred
provide a large benefit, especially if the individual pays the
interest income tax at a lower marginal rate during retirement.

The

as yell as a
disadvantage of IRA5 is that investors must pay past taxes,
10 percent penalty, if they withdraw funds from the IRA before age 59 1/2.
Ozanne and Lindeman (1987) have calculated the tax benefits from
purchasing an IRA.

Assume that the individual is initially subject to a

28 percenttax rate while working, and a 15 percent tax rate while
retired.

Under the traditional rules for IRAs which allow both

contribution deductibility and deferred taxation,

$1000 of earnings

deposited for 15 years at 8 percent interest would yield a net return of
$2,696, which is a 62 percent gain over the $1668 return on a traditional,

taxable account.

If the contribution were not deductible, but interest

were deferred (i.e., current rules for jointly filing taxpayers with
income above $50,000), then the return would be $2049, or an advantage of
23 percent.

In short, the deductibility of the contribution accounts for

roughly two-thirds of the total tax advantage to IRAs.

Given the

substantial financial incentives for saving through IRAs, one might have
as we
expected extensive enrollment across the population.5 However,
discuss in the next section, barely one-third of the population had opened
an IRA account by early 1985.
Individual Retirement Account rules allow a surprising degree of
flexibility in the type of investment allowed.

Taxpayers can convert

stocks and bonds into IRAs, and can even place gold coins issued by the US
government (or by states) in the IRA.

While gold coins seem to be an odd

investment to put in an IRA, since they are not taxed heavily, newspaper
advertisements during the mid-1980s touted gold IRAs quite heavily.

One

restriction on IRA investments is that they cannot be used to purchase
collectibles such as antiques or paintings.

III.

Who Purchases IRAs
As a first step, it is important to explain who buys and who doesn't

buy IRAs.

The traditional life cycle theory of saving focuses on

retirement income as the primary motivation for saving.

If this is so,

then all families should open an IRA, even if it is quite modest in size.
The family enjoys a higher rate of return on saving that presumably was
intended for retirement consumption.

A more complicated life cycle model

to
recognizes that families with less financial wealth may contribute less

8

an IRA because liquid assets may be needed in the near future to purchase
houses or to pay for education.
We test this proposition using the IRS/University of Michigan panel
data set which follows a sample of taxpayers over tine (Slemrod,

1988).

The sample includes taxpayers who were under age 65, continuously married
or single, and who were in the sample between 1979 and 1984.
3991 taxpayers were included in the sample.

A total of

We construct a measure of

imputed financial taxable wealth based on 1980/81 interest and dividend
income (averaged over two years to reduce year-to-year fluctuations). To
construct this measure of wealth, we assume that taxpayers received an
average 10 percent return on taxable interest-bearing wealth and 5 percent
from stock dividends (i.e., the approximate return on bonds, and the
dividend yield, during the period 1980/81).
Table 1 presents the percentage of taxpayers who bought IRAs during
1982-84, arranged by the level of imputed financial wealth.

Wealth was

used in this table rather than adjusted gross income (AOl) for two
reasons.

First, (as we show below), financial wealth is a much better

predictor of IRA purchases than income, perhaps because many high (gross)
income taxpayers report very low AGIs.

Second, taxpayers with low wealth

are less likely to purchase IRAs (holding income constant) because IRAs
are illiquid or because of borrowing constraints.
The second column of Table 1 shows that more than 86 percent of
taxpayers with financial wealth less than $2000 did not buy an IRA during
the years 1982-84.

finding which is clearly inconsistent with the traditional
model in which families might be expected to devote at least a fraction of
their wealth to retirement.
A statistical answer to the question of who buys IRAs can be gained
from regression analysis, in which we estimate IRA dollar purchases as a
function of various exogenous factors such as AOl, asset income, tax
results
rates, cash owed to the IRS, and demographic factors.6 Regression

increase in the level of wealth from less than $1000 to $10,000 (holding

The finding

that families with higher assets purchase more IRAs is evidence in favor
of a "portfolio" model; individuals contribute to IRAs if there are other
more liquid assets available. It is also consistent with Venti and Wise
(l987a),

who found that IRA enrollees had higher levels of median wealth

holding constant income and age.
We have calculated the (net-of-IRA) marginal tax rate for each
taxpayer.

The out-of-pocket "price" per dollar of IRA contribution is one

minus this tax rate.

The price variable is significant and negative; it

40 percent to
implies that a decline in the marginal tax rate from, say,

10

28 percent would reduce IRA purchases by $398, holding both wealth and AOl
constant.7 The strong impact of the tax rate on IRA purchases suggests
that IRA enrollments would have declined in 1987 even if the eligibility
rules had not been tightened.

A

variable measuring whether the taxpayer owed money to the IRS (in

addition to income already withheld) was also introduced, along with an
interactive variable reflecting whether interest and dividend income was
in excess of $250.

These two variables are designed to test the

hypothesis that taxpayers are more likely to contribute to an IRA when
they owe money to the IRS (perhaps because of the psychic cost of writing
a check to the IRS!).

If only economic factors were important, these two

two variables should not affect IRA purchases.

However, we find that the

representative taxpayer will contribute on average $184 (with low asset
income) or $518 (with asset income above $250) more to an IRA if he owes
money to the IRS at the end of the tax year.8
There are a number of alternative explanations for this finding.

One

is that taxpayers do not generally pay withholding taxes on capital
income.

Those with high levels of wealth would both owe extra taxes on

April 14, and enroll in IRAs.

However, the statistical analysis has

already controlled for the wealth level; the regression implies that
between two taxpayers with

identical

wealth, the one who owes money to the

IRS will be more likely to purchase an IRA.

Another explanation for our

finding is that aggressive tax planners both regularly underwithhold tax
payments, and buy IRAs.

If this were the case, then a spurious (positive)

correlation between underwithholding and IRA purchases would be found,
although we find it unlikely that fine-tuned tax planning could account

11

for such large differences in average IRA purchases.
One problem with the least squares regression is that it cannot
account for the bunching of taxpayers either at zero (for those who
purchase no IRAs) or at $2000 (for those that contribute up to their
putative legal limit).

Because of this bunching, least-squares regresáion

results will generally understate the true impact of the explanatory
variables on IRA contributions. The two-limit Tobit estimation method
corrects for this problem; the regression results are also presented in
Table A.l.

In general, the results are consistent with the ordinary least

squares regressions, but the coefficient are larger (and the t-statistics
smaller).

For example, the two-limit Tobit regression implies that

desired IRA purchases will rise by $667 (rather than $398) as a result of
a decline in tax rates from .40 to .28.
In summary, this section has shown that IRA purchases are highly
correlated with asset wealth, and that the marginal tax rate and the cash
position of the taxpayer has a strong impact on IRA purchases.

These

latter two effects support the notion that the cash value of deducting an
IRA (the size of the IRA times the marginal tax rate) nay loom large in
the mind of the taxpayer who owes money to the IRS.9

It is interesting to

note that the regression results contradict the "liquidity constraint"
view of saving.

Taxpayers flush with tax refunds are

jg likely to

open

an IRA than taxpayers who owe money to the IRS.
Finally, we present evidence that suggests some level of ignorance
about the true legal limits on IRA contributions. The law states that
allowable maximum contributions for single taxpayers are $2000; for
couples with one spouse working, $2250 ($2000 in the working spouse's

12

account, and $250 in the nonworking spouse's account); and for couples
with both spouses working, $4000.

Yet a very large fraction of these

latter two groups contributed exactly $2000.

While these families may not

have chosen to contribute the full $4000 (or $2250),

it seems unlikely

that they would have chosen exactly $2000 unless they thought themselves
(falsely) constrained to that point.

To estimate the magnitude of false

constraints, we use the NBER Taxsim model to estimate both the number of
taxpayers who were thus constrained, and the increased contributions that
would have occurred had those individuals chosen to contribute their legal
maximum.

The breakdown is presented in Table 2 by imputed wealth level.

We estimate that in 1935, 5.5 million taxpayers (of the total 14 million
who contributed) were falsely constrained at $2000.

Had they contributed

the legal maximum, they would have increased IRA saving by $10.5 billion,
with the largest increase in contributions by those with AOl between
$30,000 and $70,000.
There are alternative explanations for the $2000 limit contribution
that do not rely on ignorance. First, it may not be worth the trouble to
open up a new account for the spouse if his or her legal limit is only
$250.

But in total, the foregone $250 contributions account for only $2

billion of the $10.5 billion in potential IRA enrollments.

Another

potential explanation is "marital distrust"; taxpayers do not open an IRA
account in their spouse's name, but only in their own.

We feel that the

most compelling explanation for the false $2000 limits is that the
advertisements and brochures for IRAs common during the early 1980s made
both a positive impression on consumers (encouraging them to buy IRAs) and
a negative impression (that $2000 was the legal limit).

13
IV, Do IRAs

Reyresent New

Saving?

In this section, we address the primary question of the paper: Do
IRAs represent new saving, or are they "old" saving (or new loans)
reshuffled into IRAs to minimize taxes?

Simple economic theory suggests

that while IRAs offer a higher rate of return on savings below the
contribution limit, they offer no incentive for saving above that amount.
Absent wealth effects, individuals who regularly save above their IRA
limit have no incentive to save more, since they face the same after-tax
marginal rate.
people

-

- small

In this view, IRAs can target only a limited group of
savers who had previously planned to save less than $2000

for their retirement.'°
Venti and Wise (1986; l987a; l987b) suggest a richer model of saving,
in which IRA saving and non-IRA saving may be imperfect substitutes in the
consumer's portfolio.

To the extent that IRA saving substitutes for

non-IRA saving (leaving total saving unaffected), "reshuffling" occurs.
They develop a sophisticated econometric technique which suggests that
IRAs are drawn primarily from consumption rather than from other, taxable,
forms of saving.

They must impose strong assumptions, however, to

disentangle the effect of individual characteristics (that is, people who
have a high propensity to save may be more likely to buy IRA5) from the
structural parameters they want to estimate using data from only a single
year (Deaton, 1987).
Carroll and Summers (1987) note that the savings rates in the United
States and Canada, after tracking one another closely for a number of
years, diverged substantially in the mid 1970s; by 1982,

the US private

saving rate had dropped to 5.5 percent, while the Canadian rate had risen

14

to 10.6 percent.

They suggested that the broad eligibility, and higher

limits, for retirement saving plans in Canada could have accounted in part
for the higher Canadian saving rate.

While the Canadian retirement

savings accounts may have stimulated saving (they have contributed more
than 20 percent of personal saving in every year since 1976), by the early
l980s they could account at best for one-quarter of the divergence in
personal saving rates.
Our test of whether IRAs are net saving is to compare the taxable
interest and dividend income of IRA enrollees with the equivalent income
of nonenrollees.

In the reshuffling hypothesis, taxable assets are

converted into IRAs, so one would expect that taxable asset income in 1984
relative to 1980/81 (before IRAs were commonly used) should be less for
IRA enrollees. The new saving hypothesis implies that IRA contributions
would come at the expense of consumption rather than existing saving.
Because we compare changes in asset income between 1980/81 and 1984 for
those buying, and those not buying, IRAs, we correct for secular changes
in interest and dividend income during the 4-year period.
The magnitude of changes in dividend and interest income is large
when the shuffling hypothesis is true.

Consider a taxpayer at a 30

percent tax rate who shifts $2000 at the outset of each year from her
money market account (which pays the 3-month Treasury rate)

into an IRA.

By 1984, the decline in taxable interest income caused by the IRA
contributions would have been $614, which is 30 percent of average taxable
dividend and interest income during 1984.

The decline would be less

pronounced if the hypothetical taxpayer contributed to the IRA account at
the end of the tax year rather than the beginning.

15

Table 3 describes taxable interest and dividend income in 1980/Si and
for different levels of financial wealth in 1980/81,

1984,

and for the

number of years during 1982-84 that the taxpayer purchased an IRA.

The

top number in each category is average interest and dividend income in
1980/Si,

the bottom is for 1984.

There is an overall growth in interest

and dividend income for all groups, which is consiatent with the secular
increase reported in the IRS aggregate statistics.

The striking result is

that taxable asset income rises by more for those who purchased IRAs.
This result is shown graphically in Figure 1.

The bar graph describes the

change in interest and dividend income for two groups;

those who purchased

no IRAs, and those who purchased IRAs in all three years.

For all levels

of initial asset wealth, the increase in asset income is greater for those
who purchased IRAs than for those who did not.
Taxable asset accumulation is positively correlated with the number

$101 ($146

-

$25);

for those buying an IRA in one year, asset income grew

by $363; for two years, $632, and for three years, $848.

Similar results

are realized for all asset classes except for the very wealthiest.

Not

only do these results reject the reshuffling hypothesis, but they go
beyond the new saving argument to imply that IRAs "crowd in" taxable
saving.

A

proponent of the reshuffling hypothesis might reply to the evidence

in Table 3 by observing that taxpayers could be financing their IRA
purchases with loans, so that asset income would be unaffected by IRA

16

purchases.

To test this proposition, we compare tax-deductible interest

payments, excluding mortgage interest, for IRA enrollees and nonenrollees."
These comparisons are presented in Table 4, and are also shown in Figure
2.

Note that the calculations are limited to taxpayers who itemize.

Like

the comparisons of interest and dividend income, Figure 2 shows the change
in tax deductible interest payments for two groups;
IRAs,

those who purchased no

and those who purchased IRAs, in each of the three years 1982-84.

Looking at those with wealth less than $2000, interest payments increased
by $251 for nonenrollees, and by $522 for enrollees. The difference in
interest payments, $271,

could account for almost two years of IRA

purchases.'2 The ordering holds as well for taxpayers with a greater amount
of asset income.

IRA enrollees may suggest some asset shifting,

Feldstein and Feenberg (1983) observed that if the reshuffling
argument were correct, many taxpayers would be unable to purchase IRAs for
nore than a few years before their liquid assets would be depleted.

If

taxpayers with less asset income (and presumably lower AGI) were unable to
sustain IRA purchases for more than a few years, then IRAs should, over
time, become concentrated among high-income individuals.

proposition with data from the IRS Statistics of Income for 1982 and
preliminary reports for 1986 (501 Bulletin, Winter 1987-88).

are addressing: do pensions crowd out private retirement saving?
results are similar to ours; those with pensions saved

saving than those without pensions, conditioning on factors such as
income.5

Katona's explanation for the positive correlation between pension

saving and nonpens ion saving is that
the provision of adequate funds during old age no longer appears an
insurmountably difficult problem: being closer to the goal stimulates
people to work harder to achieve the goal, and therefore collective
retirement plans promote individual saving. (p. 5)

That is, individuals view pension plans as bringing them within reach
of a comfortable retirement, so it becomes worthwhile to save the extra
amount (in nonpension saving) to attain their goal.

Both the subtle

reshuffling explanation, and Katona's "goal attainment" explanation (a
stronger form of the new saving hypothesis), are consistent with the data,
but at this stage, we cannot distinguish between the two.

We can

decisively rule out the simple reshuffling view of IRAs.
Thus far, we have focused only on the incentive aspects of IRAs.

One

of the primary criticisms of IRA enrollment has been the exten; to which
the tax subsidy benefited high-income taxpayers. As Figure 3 shows, those
with AGI above $50,000 (9 percent of all taxpayers) accounted for 41
percent of all IRA purchases (and one-third of enrollees).

One response

to this finding is that many taxpayers are young or retired, and not in
the market for any type of retirement saving.

A better measure of the

progressivity of IRAs comes from a comparison of the progressivity of
interest and dividend income relative to the progressivity of IRA
purchases for taxpayers under age 65.

One might expect that IRA purchases

21

would be more progressive because wealthy families are prevented from
contributing more than $2000 per taxpayer.

To test this hypothesis, we

show the cumulative distribution of interest and dividend income and IRAs
during 1985 for taxpayers under the age of 65 in Figure 4.

Once again,

the horizontal axis shows the cumulative distribution of taxpayers on the
basis of AOl, while the vertical axis shows the cumulative distribution of
interest and dividend income, and IRA contributions, during 1985.

IRA

contributions are less progressive than overall asset income for 85
percent of the taxpayers (income less than $40,000 in 1985).

The results

shown here suggest that a generalized saving incentive for all interest
and dividend income (along the lines of lower marginal rates on nonwage
income) might have provided a more equitable saving incentive than IRAs.

V. Conclusion
The period 1982-86 may be remembered as the years of the IRA saving
incentive experiment.

Whether the IRA experiment represented a massive

subsidy provided to wealthy taxpayers

or

-

-

with

no increase in net saving

-

whether it represented a successful and popular tax incentives, is

still open to debate.

This paper has presented evidence supporting the

view that IRA saving represents new saving.

If there is tax reshuffling,

it occurs only marginally through increased borrowing, or through a more
subtle form of reshuffling; individuals who are buying IRAs would have
increased their taxable saving by even more had the IRAs not been
available.
We have also provided evidence that even those taxpayers who did
enroll in IRAs did not take full advantage of its provisions.

More than

-

22

one-third of all IRA contributors in 1985 contributed exactly $2000 when
they were eligible to contribute more.

While they could have been acting

rationally for reasons unclear to us, we suggest that a lack of public
information about the size of IRA limits led to their underutilization.
Finally, we have shown that IRAs were not particularly progressive;
for income levels less than $40,000, a generalized saving incentive for
interest and dividend income might have been more equitable than the
existing IRA system.

However, it is not clear that a general saving

incentive system would have been as successful as an IRA in encouraging
new saving.

Our results suggest that taxpayers need the immediate

gratification of a tax deduction to nudge them towards adequate retirement
saving.

The IRS reported that the proportion of taxpayers contributing to IRAs

fell from 13.4 percent in 1986 to 7.2 percent in 1987 (preliminary).

The

loss in terms of dollars is likely to be greater given the tightened
contribution limits.
21n 1986, personal saving was 130.2 billion dollars while IRA

contributions were 38.3 billion dollars (Economic Retlort of the
President, 1987; SOl Bulletin, Winter 1987-88). This figure does not
include reinvested interest and dividends from existing IRA accounts.
The fraction approaches 70 percent of personal saving when the NIPA
personal saving data are adjusted for inflation and pension contributions
(Summers and Carroll, l987a).
Between 1975 and 1985, personal savings declined by 2.9 percent of
GNP (Summers and Carroll, 1987).

Since IRA5 accounted for roughly 1

percent of CNP, they could not have entirely offset the secular fall in
savings.
4We assume a marginal tax rate of 30 percent to calculate the tax loss

from the $22 Billion in shifted assets.

This loss is overstated because

it ignores the taxes that will be paid in the future when the IRA is
redeemed (although it neglects the foregone tax revenue on interest
accruing to the retirement account).
5Preliminary government estimates of the revenue loss from IRAs were
minimal, in some cases less than $1 billion.

tax bracket, the net outlay would have been $2800; at a 12 percent

$336.

We ignore the reduction in tax liability caused by IRA

contributions.
15

Katona avoids one problem that we face in our study. As he points

out, he does not have to worry about people with strong tastes for saving
choosing pensions (as we must worry about "savers" enrolling in IRAs).
The reason is that pensions are provided for all employees, and not just
those who like to save.

He tests for whether employees with a taste for

saving choose employers with pensions plans, but finds no evidence in
favor of such self-selection.
