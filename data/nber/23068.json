    "abstract": "\n\nAlan Garber and Jonathan Skinner (2008) famously conjectured that the US health care system was \u201cuniquely inefficient\u201d relative to other countries. We test this idea using cross-country data on prescription drug sales newly linked with an arguably objective measure of relative therapeutic benefits, or drug quality.  Specifically, we investigate how higher and lower quality drugs diffuse in the US relative to Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK.  Our tabulations suggest that lower quality drugs diffuse more in the US relative to high quality drugs, compared to each of our four comparison countries \u2013 consistent with Garber and Skinner\u2019s conjecture.\n\n",
