    "abstract": "\n\nWe partnered with the Ghanaian government to test simultaneously four methods of increasing achievement in schools with low and heterogeneous student achievement| assistant led remedial pull-out lessons, assistant led remedial after school lessons, assistant led smaller class sizes, or teacher implemented partial day tracking. Despite implementation issues, the interventions increased student learning by about 0.1SD, about 0.4SD when adjusting for the imperfect implementation, with no effects on attendance, grade repetition, or drop-out. Test score increases were larger for girls and gains persisted after the program ended. Fidelity of implementation decreased over time for the assistants but increased for the teachers.\n\n",
