    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze attention to personal financial accounts using panel data that includes logins, spending, income, balances, and credit limits. We find that income arrivals cause individuals to log in and that attention is positively correlated with cash holdings and liquidity, is negatively correlated with consumer debt holdings, and increases when bank account balances change from negative to positive. We discuss how our findings relate to theories of rational and selective inattention and conclude that ostrich effects in a personal finance context, i.e., the fear of paying attention to bank account balances, is a more widespread phenomenon than previously thought.\n\n",
