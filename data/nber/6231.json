    "abstract": "\n\nDespite several theoretical contributions and considerable informal empirical evidence\" to the contrary, a notion that trade and investment are substitutes persists in trade policy\" analysis.  This paper considers the liberalization of commodity trade versus liberalization\" allowing direct investment versus the two together.  For a relatively skilled-labor-scarce\" economy, I show that trade and investment liberalization are quite different together are in a sense complements.  The intuition may be that direct investment provides such\" a country with crucial inputs (knowledge-intensive producer services) without which the\" country cannot effectively exploit its abundant factors in certain industries.\"\n\n",
