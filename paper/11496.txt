The “News” View of Economic Fluctuations: Evidence from Aggregate Japanese Data and
Sectoral U.S. Data

NBER Working Paper No. 11496
July 2005
JEL No. E3
ABSTRACT
This paper uses aggregate Japanese data and sectoral U.S. data to explore the properties of the joint
behavior of stock prices and total factor productivity (TFP) with the aim of highlighting data patterns
that are useful for evaluating business cycle theories. The approach used follows that presented in
Beaudry and Portier [2004b]. The main findings are that (i) in both Japan and the U.S., innovations
in stock prices that are contemporaneously orthogonal to TFP precede most of the long run
movements in total factor productivity and (ii) such stock prices innovations do not affect U.S.
sectoral TFPs contemporaneously, but do precede TFP increases in those sectors that are driving
U.S. TFP growth, namely durable goods, and among them equipment sectors.

Introduction

In Beaudry and Portier [2004b], we used U.S. data to document properties of the joint behavior of
Total Factor Productivity (hereafter TFP) and stock prices (hereafter SP) that are supportive of
a “news view” of business cycles, that is, a view of business cycles where it is news about future
developments in productivity that drive fluctuations. In particular, we presented two orthogonalized
moving average representation for these variables: one based on an impact restriction and one
based on a long run restriction. We then examined the correlation between the innovations that
drive the long run movements in TFP and the stock prices innovation which is contemporaneously
orthogonal to TFP. We found this correlation to be positive and almost equal to 1, indicating
that permanent changes in productivity growth are preceded by stock market booms. We showed
why this observed positive correlation runs counter to that predicted by simple models where
surprise changes in productivity drive fluctuations. We also discussed how the pattern could arise
if agents have advanced information about future technological opportunities, or if productivity
growth emerges as a delayed byproduct of a period high investment activity. In either case, the
results suggests that expected changes in technological opportunities may be central to business
cycle fluctuations even if surprise changes in productivity are not.
In this paper, we extend this analysis to Japanese aggregate data and U.S. sectoral data.
The analysis of aggregate Japanese data confirms our previous results: stock prices innovations
do contain most of the information about the long run movements of aggregate TFP, and are
responsible for short run business cycle fluctuations. Our econometric setup also allows for an
account of the Japanese “lost decade”, and shows that a downward revision of TFP growth in 1990
and 1992, which first revealed itself in stock prices, can account for the low performance of TFP
and SP in the 1990s.
Second, we analyze the relation between the aggregate U.S. stock prices innovation and the
behavior of sectoral manufacturing TFP. Our analysis of U.S. Manufacturing two-digit data shows
that the stock prices news is indeed a shock that does not affect sectoral TFPs on impact, but
increases TFP in the long run for those sectors that are driving TFP growth, namely durable
goods, and among them equipment sectors.

The Setup

In this section, we present the tools introduced in Beaudry and Portier [2004b], which can be
described as a new way of using orthogonalization techniques –i.e. impact and long run restrictions
– to learn about the nature of technological progress diffusion and business cycle fluctuations.
Those techniques are not used simultaneously, but sequentially, to describe the joint behavior of
stock prices (SP) and measured total factor productivity (TFP).

2.1

Two Orthogonalization Schemes

Assume that we have an estimate of the reduced form moving average (Wold) representation for
the bivariate system {T F Pt , SPt }, as given below (for ease of presentation we neglect any drift
terms).





∆T F Pt
µ1,t
= C(L)
∆SPt
µ2,t
P∞
where L is the lag operator, C(L) = I + i=1 Ci Li , and where the variance co-variance matrix of
µ is given by Ω. Furthermore, we will assume that the system has at least one stochastic trend
and therefore C(1) is not equal to zero (this is confirmed by unit roots and cointegration tests for
aggregate U.S. and Japanese series).
We want to consider two alternative representations with orthogonalized errors, one that imposes an impact restriction on the representation and one that imposes a long run restriction. Let
us denote these two alternative representations by:


where Γ(L) = ∞
 are
i=0 Γi L , Γ(L) =
i=o Γi L and the variance covariance matrices of  and e
identity matrices. In order to get such a representation, say in the case of (1), we need to find the
Γ matrices that solve the following system of equations:

Γ0 Γ00 = Ω
Γi
= Ci Γ0 for i > 0
However, since the above system has one more variable than equations, it is necessary to add a
restriction to pin down a particular solution. In case (1), we will pin down a solution by imposing
that the 1, 2 element of Γ0 be equal to zero, that is, we choose an orthogonalization where the
4

second disturbance 2 has no contemporaneous impact on TFP. In case (2), we impose that the 1, 2
P
e
e
element of the long run matrix Γ(1)
= ∞
i=0 Γi equals zero, that is, we choose an orthogonalization
where the disturbance e
2 has no long run impact on TFP (the use of this type of orthogonalization
was first proposed by Blanchard and Quah [1989]). We will refer to 2 as the stock prices innovation,
whereas e
1 will be referred to as the permanent shock to TFP.

2.2

Some Simple Structural Interpretations

Here we illustrate the implications of sequentially using impact and long-run restrictions. We do so
in a canonical optimal growth model in which technological improvements come either as surprises
or are announced in advance, so that agents recognize the potential impact of an innovation before
it has improved productivity. We will show that these two models deliver different predictions with
respect to the correlation between  and e
. As we want to derive simple and explicit results, the
models we present here do not aim at realism as many assumptions are made in order to allow
analytical solutions.
A Simple Optimal Growth Model with Technology and Preference Shocks:
consider an economy in which preferences of the representative household are given by


∞
X
Lσt
t
U = E0
β log Ct − Λt
σ

Let us

(1)

t=0)

where C is consumption, L labor and Λ a stationary preference shock.
Λt = eη2,t

(2)

It is assumed that σ > 1 and that β lies inside the unit interval. The preference shock acts here as
a “demand” shock. A government spending shock would be a more natural candidate for a demand
shock, but the present formulation has the advantage of analytical tractability, and for our purpose,
is equivalent to a government spending shock. The household accumulates capital, and we assume
full depreciation, so that
Kt+1 = It

(3)

where K is capital and I investment. The budget constraint of the household, that rents capital
and labor services to the representative firm, is given by
Ct + It = wt Lt + κt It−1

5

(4)

where κ is the rental rate of capital services and w the wage rate.
The representative firm in this economy produces according to the CRS technology
Yt = eθt Ktγ Lt1−γ

(5)

with γ ∈ ]0, 1[ and where θ is a random walk technology shock.
θt = θt−1 + η1,t

(6)

η1,t and η2,t are assumed to be iid processes with identity covariance matrix and zero mean.
We assume that agents behave competitively, maximize utility or profit at given prices and that
markets clear. In such an economy, as shown in the appendix, the solution is log-linear. With this
solution, one can perform the short-run and long-run orthogonalizations we presented above, and
recover the shocks  and e
 as functions of the structural shocks η1,t and η2,t . Since firms make zero
profits every period, the stock market value of firms is uninteresting in this model, but there are
still asset prices fluctuations in the bond market. Hence, we will focus here on the joint behavior
of TFP and the bond price as the system of interest, that is, the bond price will play the role of
the variable SPt introduced in the preceding section (the only property that this second variable
should have is that it should agglomerate expectations).
In this model, the equilibrium joint behavior of (the log of) TFP (that is θ) and (the log of)
bond price (denoted pb ) has a structural moving average given by:

Performing short-run and long-run identification on this system, we obtain
1 = η1 , 2 = η2 , e
1 = η1 , e
2 = η2

(8)

In particular, we have 2 ⊥ e
1 .
A Model with One Period Delayed Response of Innovation on Productivity :

Let us

now consider a small deviation from the RBC model we just presented. We now assume that θt has
both a permanent component–θ̄t – and a temporary component – νt , and we disregard preference
shock so as to keep exactly as many shocks as variables. The important additional assumption
is that permanent innovation to technology are known to agents one period before they actually

6

impact TFP1 . The process for (the log of) TFP can therefore be expressed as follows:

 T F Pt = θ̄t + νt
θ̄t+1
= θ̄t + η1,t

νt
= ρνt−1 + η2,t ,
0<ρ<1
In this model, the structural moving average for TFP and bond prices can be shown to be given
by (see the appendix):

(9)

Performing short-run and long-run identification on this system, we obtain
1 = η2 , 2 = η1 , e
1 = η1 , e
2 = η2

(10)

In particular, we have that 2 is co-linear to e
1 .
Discussion :

In Beaudry and Portier [2004b], we have illustrated the fact that U.S. postwar data

are typically displaying co-linearity between 2 and e
1 . Such a result favors a view of business cycles
driven largely by a shock that does not affect productivity in the short run – and therefore does
not look like a standard technology shock – but affects productivity with substantial delay – and
therefore does not look like a demand shock. One structural interpretation we have suggested for
this shock is that it represents news about future technological opportunities which is first captured
in stock prices. We have shown that this shock causes a boom in consumption, investment and
hours worked that precedes productivity growth by a few years. In the next section, we show that
those results are also found when one study Japanese aggregate data.

Aggregate Analysis For The U.S. and Japan

3.1

Data and Specification Issues

In our empirical investigation, we will make use of annual japanese and US data.
U.S. Data :

U.S. data cover the period 1948 to 2000. The two series that interest us for our bi-

variate analysis are an index of stock market value (SP) and a measure of total factor productivity.
1

Hairault, Langot, and Portier [1997] have proposed the estimation of an informational structure close to that one
in an otherwise standard RBC model. In Beaudry and Portier [2004b], we provide an endowment economy example
in which we allow for gradual diffusion of the innovation into TFP, instead of this very crude assumption of a one
period lag for implementation of the technological shock. In Beaudry and Portier [2004a], we study a more realistic
setup in which agents receive noisy signals about future values of productivity growth.

7

The stock market index we use is the quarterly Standards & Poors 500 Composite Stock Prices
Index, deflated by the seasonally adjusted implicit prices deflator of GDP in the nonfarm private
business sector and transformed in per-capita terms by dividing it by the population aged 15 to
64. We denote the log of this index by SP
The construction of our baseline TFP series is relatively standard. We restrict our attention to
the nonfarm private business sector. From the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we retrieved two
series: labor share (sh ) and capital services (KS) which measures the services derived from the
stock of physical assets and software. The average value of the labor share is sh = 67.66%. Output
(Y ) and hours (H) are nonfarm business measures from 1947 to 2000 (also from U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics). We then construct a measure of (log) TFP as

T F Pt = log
Japanese Data :

Htsh KSt1−sh

Japanese data cover the period 1960 to 2000. Most are obtained from Hayashi

and Prescott2 : TFP, GNP deflator, age 20-69 population in millions, Total Hours, Consumption
(Private consumption) and Investment (Private Fixed Capital Investment). The Hours series have
been deflated by the 20-69 population series. The investment and consumption series have been
deflated by both GN P deflator and age 20-69 population. The stock prices series is the end-of-year
Nikkei 2253 , deflated by the GN P deflator and the age 20-69 population.
Specification:

From our data on TFP and SP, we first want to recover the Wold moving average

representation for ∆T F P and ∆SP . Unit root tests and cointegration tests (not reported here)
indicate that SP and TFP are likely cointegrated I(1) processes, so a natural means of recovering
the Wold representation is by inverting a Vector Error Correcting Model (VECM). The second
specification choice concerns the number of lags to include in the VECM. Our strategy is not to
impose much on the data. According to a likelihood ratio test two lags are chosen for U.S. data
and six for Japanese data. We will show that Japanese results are robust to a specification with
one or two lags.

3.2

Lessons for TFP movements

We estimated a VECM for (T F P, SP ) with one cointegrating relation and recovered two orthogonalized shock series corresponding to the  and e
 discussed in Section 2, that is,  was recovered
by imposing an impact restriction (a restriction on Γ0 ) and e
 was recovered by imposing a long
run restriction. The level impulse responses on (T F P, SP ) associated with the 2 shock and the
e
1 shock are displayed on Figure 1. The U.S. results are those presented in Beaudry and Portier
[2004b].
The first remarkable result is that for Japanese data as well as for the US ones, those responses
appear very similar when comparing one orthogonalization to another. The dynamics associated
with the 2 shock – the stock prices innovation that is by construction contemporaneously orthogonal to TFP– seems to permanently affect TFP, while the dynamics associated with the e
1 shock
–which by construction has a permanent effect on TFP– has essentially no impact effect on TFP but
has a substantial effect on SP. On the one hand, these results suggest that 2 contains information
about future TFP growth which is instantaneously and positively reflected in stock prices. While
on the other hand, they suggest that permanent changes in TFP are first reflected in stock prices
before they actually increase productive capacity. From both U.S. and Japanese data, we observe
that it takes four to six years for TFP to respond positively in a significant way. Note that those
results are robust to the choice of the number of lags in the VECM: Figure 4 shows that the IRF
are very close if one imposes one or two lags instead of six.
The similarity between the effects of these two shocks is further confirmed by the inspection of
the forecast error variance decomposition plot (Figure 2). Observe that the e
1 shock explains very
little of the short run movements of TFP (less than 30% the first 4 years). On the other hand,
the 2 shock explains most of the long run variance of TFP after 30 years (80% for Japan). This
result derives from the quasi-identity between the 2 shock and the e
1 shock, as shown in Figure 3,
which simply plots 2,t against e
1,t . The correlation coefficient between these two series is .98 (with
a standard deviation of .03) for the U.S. and .91 (with a standard deviation of .07) for Japan, that
is, these two orthogonalization techniques recover virtually the same shock series.
What kind of structural macroeconomic model is consistent with these two orthogonalization
techniques generating the same shock series? For Japan as for the U.S., this pattern appears
consistent with the view –which we call the news view– that improvements in productivity are
generally anticipated by market participants due to a lag between the recognition of a technological

9

innovation and its eventual impact on productivity.

3.3

Lessons for Macroeconomic Fluctuations

The observation that our estimates of 2 and e
1 are highly correlated and induce similar impulse
responses suggests that news about future technological developments may be a relevant driving
force behind business cycle fluctuations. In Beaudry and Portier [2004b], it is shown that, in the
U.S., output, consumption, investment and hours worked respond positively to this shock and
exhibit dynamics characteristic of business cycles.
Let us proceed to similar estimation for Japan. To that end, we estimate the following truncated
moving average representation for different variables Zt :
∆Zt =

J
X

φuj ut−j + µt

(11)

j=0

where Z will either be consumption (C), investment (I), output (C + I) or hours (H), u is either 2
or e1 and where µ is a variable-specific disturbance that is orthogonal to u. The resulting sequence
P
given by nj=0 φj provides an estimate of the impulse response function of X to a u shock, that is,
the response to what we claim may be a news shocks. The truncation is done for J = 5.
Figure 5 displays the responses of consumption, investment, output (defined as C +I) and hours
to 2 and e
1 , that is, the responses to what we suggest may reflect news of a technological innovation
which only diffuses slowly into productive system. As can be seen in the Figure, the responses to
both shocks are very similar. Consumption and Hours increase by about .5% on impact, while the
impact response of Investment and Output is more modest. After one year, all responses are above
one percentage point, except for consumption that, as expected, reacts more smoothly.
As in the case of U.S. data, these results suggest that a stock prices innovation, 2 , (i) creates
business cycle like fluctuations, (ii) does not affect TFP contemporaneously and (iii) affects TFP
in the long run. This pattern is consistent with the interpretation of 2 as being primarily a news
shock. Such a structural interpretation is supported by the fact that the responses of the economy
to 2 and e
1 are very similar.

3.4

Accounting for the Japanese “Lost Decade”

Here we use the estimated VECMs to decompose historical movements into components explained
by the various epsilons. Formally, and using the short run identification as an example, we start

where C is a vector of constant term and Π is the cointegration coefficients vector. Starting from
the observed initial conditions for TFP and SP, we can construct the series T F P 2 and SP 2 of the
variations of TFP and SP explained by 2 only (in other words what would have happened absent
of 1 shocks) as

(13)

The same computation can be done for the shock e
1 . The idea is then to use such expressions
to decompose observed Japanese fluctuations in a meaningful way.
Figure 6 displays the series of estimated 2 and e
1 , which are, as stated earlier, very similar. We
observe that two large negative shocks hit the Japanese economy in 1990 and 1992. According to
the short identification schemes, those shocks 2 are negative innovations to the stock market. But
those shocks are also e
1 shocks, and according to the long run identification, they are downward
revisions of the long run level of TFP.
It is interesting to put this observation in perspective with the conclusions of Hayashi and
Prescott [2002]. As they wrote in the conclusion of their study,
“ In examining the virtual stagnation that Japan began experiencing in the early 1990s, we
find that the problem is not a breakdown of the financial system [...]. The problem is low
productivity growth. [...] We said very little about the “bubble” period of the late 1980s and
early 1990s, a boom period when property prices soared, investment as a fraction of GDP was
unusually high, and output grew faster than in any other years in the 1980s and 1990s. We think
the unusual pickup in economic activities, particularly investment, was due to an anticipation
of higher productivity growth that never materialized. To account for the bubble period along
these lines, we need to have a model where productivity is stochastic and where agents receive
an indicator of future productivity.” (page 227-228)

The model the authors are describing is indeed a “news” type of model, in the spirit of the theoretical example we have presented earlier in the text. Note that such a model predicts collinearity
between 2 and e
1 , which is also what is supported by Japanese data.
Our two orthogonalized VECMs allow us to do some accounting with this type of model in
mind. Let us consider the following counterfactual exercise: starting from the actual value of the
series in 1989, we compte the path of TFP and SP as expected in 1989, together with what would
have happen if, between 1990 and 2000, all the shocks 1 and 2 (or e
1 and e
2 ) take on their realized
11

values except for 2,1990 and 2,1992 ( or e
1,1990 and e
1,1992 ) which are set to zero. The resulting
path are displayed on Figure 7. Panels (a) and (c) compare the actual path of TFP and SP with
the expected one as of 1989. TFP is in 2000 about 20 percentage points below the level that was
expected in 1989 for 2000, SP about 1.2 log points below. Panels (b) and (d) show what would
have been the path of TFP and SP absent the 1990 and 1992 shocks. Three observations can be
made. First, as expected form the collinearity between 2 and e
1 , the two counterfactuals are close
to each other. Second, most of what did happen to TFP in the 1990s is the consequence of these
two shocks. As displayed in Panels (a) and (d), the counterfactuals are far from the actual series
and close to the “expected in 1989” series. In 2000, 20 percentage points out of the 23 in the
difference between the actual TFP series and the “expected in 1989” series are explained by the
1990 and 1992 shocks. Third, the same results hold to a lesser extent for the stock prices: about
one half (60 percentage points) of the distance between the actual SP series and the “expected in
1989” one is explained by the 1990 and 1992 shocks, the other half being mainly explained by the
1995 and 1996 shocks.
What do we learn from this exercise: two stock market shocks at the beginning of the 1990s,
that where possibly the consequence of bad news about future TFP, explain most of TFP changes
in the 1990s and about half of the stock market variations. This accounting exercise says nothing
about the cause of those two shocks. The resolution of this question is still a puzzle for analysts of
the Japanese economy.

Sectoral Results For The U.S.

In this section, we focus on the U.S. economy. The shock 2 , that is identified as the stock prices
innovation in a (T F P, SP ) VECM (that is the shock that is orthogonal to current TFP, where
TFP is measured in the Nonfarm Private Business sector), has been shown to be explaining most
of the long run variance of TFP. It is of interest to go deeper in the inspection of the TFP impact
and long run response to this shock in order to give some direction for a further, more structural,
exploration. It is of particular interest to inspect the response of different sectors to that shock.
In this section, we make use of the BLS Multifactor Productivity Trends in Manufacturing–
published data for 20 SIC 2-digit Manufacturing4 . We estimate the sectoral TFP response to an
aggregate stock prices innovation following a two-step procedure. We first estimate an aggregate
2 shock, as explained in section 2. We then project each sectoral productivity T F P s , where s

where µ a variable-specific disturbance that is orthogonal to 2 . The resulting sequence given by
Pn
s
j=0 φj provides an estimate of the impulse response function of T F P to a 2 shock. We truncate
at J = 10, and our sample runs from 1951 to 2000.
Table 1 displays the impact and long run response of sectoral TFP to a one-standard-deviation
P
news shock, together with the p-values associated to the tests φ0 = 0 (“impact”) and 10
j=0 φj = 0
(“long run”). The estimated responses are displayed on Figure 8. Note that we have used the same
scale for all the panels of the figure. According to the “news” interpretation we have proposed,
the impact response should be zero, while the long run response should be positive, at least for
those sectors that have been driving aggregate TFP growth for the postwar period. What do we
obtain? Neither Manufacturing TFP as a whole, nor TFP in either the Nondurable or Durable
sector significantly increase on impact. When one goes to the two-digit series, it is only in one
out of 18 sectors – which is Transportation Equipment – that the impact response is significantly
different from zero at 5% level (note that this impact effect is negative). Therefore, one cannot
interpret the zero response of aggregate TFP as the result of some complex aggregation effect. As
far as the long run is concerned, TFP in Manufacturing, Nondurable goods and Durable goods all
respond positively, although the long run response of TFP in the Nondurable good sector is not
significantly positively at 5% level. Furthermore, most of the two digit sectors (14 out of 18, the
exceptions being Food & Kindred Products, Textile Mills Products, Lumber & Wood Products and
Furniture & Fixtures ) respond positively to the shock in the long run.
Of particular interest is the observation that the stock market innovation 2 predicts a significant
long run response of TFP in the sectors that are generally considered to have been driving U.S.
growth over the last 40 years. These sectors are Industrial Machinery & Computer Equipment,
Electric & Electronic Equipment, Transportation Equipment, Instruments (at 6.6%) for durable
goods, Petroleum Refining and Rubber & Plastic Products (at 16%) for nondurable goods. In all
these sectors, the long run response to the stock price innovation is very strong. These results give
support to the interpretation of the stock prices innovation as news about future TFP growth in
the equipment sectors.

Conclusion

The objective of this paper was to use aggregate Japanese data and sectoral U.S. data to further
explore the “news view” of business cycles. According to this view, permanent movements in TFP
are mainly predictable and show up first in forward looking variables like stock market prices. This
view, for which we found support earlier using postwar U.S. data, also finds support using the
last forty years of Japanese data. In the Japanese case, such “news” shocks are again observed to
create business cycle movements in economic activity. We also used this methodology to propose
an accounting exercise of the Japanese lost decade. Our finding is that about one half of the stock
market fall in the 1990s is indeed the mirror image of downward revisions of future TFP. Going
back to U.S. data, we show that the news about future aggregate TFP is not some artifact due to
aggregation, as the stock prices news is indeed a shock that does not affect U.S. sectoral TFPs on
impact, but that increases TFP in the long run in the sectors that are driving U.S. TFP growth,
namely durable goods, and among them equipment sectors.

Solution to the Models of Section 2.2

A Simple Optimal Growth Model with Technology and Preference Shocks:

In order

to maximize its profit, the firm equalizes marginal products of inputs with their marginal costs
Yt
Lt
Yt
γ
Kt

(1 − γ)

= wt
= κt

Denoting χt the Lagrange multiplier of the households budget constraint, maximization of intertemporal utility leads to the following first order conditions:
1
Ct

= χt

Λt Lσ−1
= χt wt
t
χt = βEt χt+1 κt+1
Combining those equations, we obtain the following recursion:
It+1
It
= αβ + αβEt
Ct
Ct+1
Solving forward and imposing the usual transversality condition leads to
Ct = (1 − βγ)Yt
It = βγYt

On the other hand, equilibrium labor is obtained from labor demand and intratemporal first order
conditions of the household program:

Lt =

1−γ
1 − βγ

1/σ

−1/σ

Λt

The equilibrium law of motion of consumption can be easily computed and is given by ( taking logs
and omitting constant terms):
ct = log(θt ) + γct−1 −

Since the price of bonds P B must satisfy the equation PtB Et CβC

A Model with One Period Delayed Response of Innovation on Productivity :

In the

model with news, first order conditions are identical to those of the RBC model, the only change
being the dating of the technological innovation. As in the RBC model, consumption is given by
γ
Ct = ΩZt Λ−(1−γ)/σ Ct−1

where Ω is a constant term and where Λ is now constant since we have assumed away preference
shocks. We then have in logs, omitting constant terms:

ct = γct−1 + log(θt−1 ) + η1,t−1 −

Since the price of bonds P B must satisfy the equation PtB Et CβC

This table reports the point estimate of the impact and long run (10 years) response of two-digit U.S.
manufacturing TFP to a shock 2 – i.e. a SP innovation in the benchmark bivariate (T F P, SP )
VECM estimated on aggregate annual U.S., with two lags and one cointegration relation. It also
reports the P-value for the test that the impact and long run (10 years) response of two-digit U.S.
manufacturing TFP to a shock 2 is zero. A ? indicates that the coefficient is significantly different
from zero at 5%, (10% for a ??).

On each panel of this figure, the bold line represents the point estimate of the responses to a unit 2
shock (the shock that does not have instantaneous impact on TFP in the short run identification); the
line with circles represents the point estimate of the responses to a unit e1 shock (the shock that has a
permanent impact on TFP in the long run identification). The unit of the vertical axis is percentage
deviation from the situation without shock. Dotted lines represent the 10% and 90% quantiles of
the distribution of the IRF in the case of the short run identification, this distribution being the
bayesian simulated distribution obtained by Monte-Carlo integration with 2500 replications, using
the approach for just-identified systems discussed in Doan [1992]. The top panels present the U.S.
estimates, using annual observations over the period 1948-2000, the bottom panels present Japanese
estimates, using annual observations over the period 1960-2000.

The top panels of this figure present responses to a unit 2 shock (the shock that does not have
instantaneous impact on TFP in the short run identification); the bottom panels present responses
to a unit e1 shock (the shock that has a permanent impact on TFP in the long run identification).
On each panel of this figure, the bold line represents the point estimate in the benchmark specification
(six lags), the lines with stars represents the point estimate when one lag is chosen, and the line with
circle the point estimate with two lags. The unit of the vertical axis is percentage deviation from
the situation without shock. Dotted lines represent the 10% and 90% quantiles of the distribution of
the IRF in the benchmark case (six lags), this distribution being the bayesian simulated distribution
obtained by Monte-Carlo integration with 2500 replications, using the approach for just-identified
systems discussed in Doan [1992].

with the path expected in 1989 (in other words what would have happen absent of all shocks after
1989). In panel (b) and (d) are compared the actual series and the series obtained with all shocks
