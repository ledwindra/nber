    "abstract": "\n\nInflation targets were introduced well ahead of the development of the theory of inflation targeting. The practice was successful because it comprised a new set of procedures and institutions for setting monetary policy in a transparent and accountable fashion \u2013 \u201cconstrained discretion\u201d; the later theory was less useful because it purported to be a theory of the determination of the price level.  But inflation targeting does not constitute a new theory of the monetary transmission mechanism. The belief that it does led to the replacement of Milton Friedman\u2019s dictum that \u201cinflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\u201d by the new dictum that \u201cinflation is always and everywhere a transitory phenomenon\u201d. This had unfortunate consequences during the recent inflation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing inflation targets in the future.\n\n",
