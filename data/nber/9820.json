    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper we analyze the macroeconomic record of 'strictly dollarized' economies. In particular we investigate whether dollarized countries have historically exhibited faster growth and lower volatility than countries with a domestic currency. We analyze this issue by using a treatment regression analysis that estimates jointly the probability of being a dollarized country, and outcome equations. Our analysis indicates that the probability of being a dollarized country depends on regional, geographical, political and structural variables. Our results also suggest GDP per capita growth has not been statistically different in dollarized and in non-dollarized ones. We also find that volatility has been significantly higher in dollarized than in non-dollarized economies. These results are robust to the estimation technique, and to the sample used.\n\n",
