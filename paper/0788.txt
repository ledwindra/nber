STOCHASTIC PROBLEMS IN THE SIMULATION OF LABOR SUPPLY
ABSTRACT

Modern work in labor supply attempts to account for nonlinear budget sets

created by government tax and transfer programs. Progressive taxation leads to
nonlinear convex budget sets while the earned income credit, social security

contributions, AFDC, and the proposed NIT plans all lead to nonlinear, nonconve
budget sets. Where nonlinear budget sets occur, the expected value of the
random variable, labor supply, can no longer be calculated by simply 'plugging

in' the estimated coefficients. Properties of the stochastic terms which arise
from the residual or from a stochastic preference structure need to be accounted

for. This paper considers both analytical approaches and Monte Carlo approaches
to the problem. We attempt to find accurate and low cost computational
techniques which would permit extensive use of simulation methodology. Large
samples are typically included in such simulations which makes computational

techniques an important consideration. But these large samples may also lead to
simplifications in computational techniques because of the averaging process used

in calculation of simulation results. This paper investigates the tradeoffs
available between computational accuracy and cost in simulation exercises over
large samples.

INTRODUCTION
Suppose that we have successfully estimated a structural model of labor

supply. Given the large amount of public interest in the question of income tax
reform, an important use of the estimated model would be to assess the possible
effects on labor supply, tax revenue, and individual welfare of proposed reforms.

These evaluations are sometimes performed using local elasticity estimates.
Mowever, such a simplified analysis may not be very accurate for the rather large

changes contemplated in many tax reform proposals. Another problem which arises
with simplified elasticity calculations is that they often ignore the

considerable heterogeneity of the population response. A better approach would
seem to be to use the estimated structural model to predict the effect of the

tax changes. Thus, we would need to derive analytically the statistical
expectation of the population response under the proposed changes; or if
analytical derivation proves to be mathematically intractible, a Monte Carlo
approach would provide the results.

But an important potential problem arises when such simulations are

conducted. This problem arises because of the nonlinear, and often nonconvex,
budget sets which arise due to progressive income taxation as well as other tax

and transfer policies. In a nonlinear econometric model with nonlinearities of
this type, it is not necessarily the case that the sources of stochastic
variation have an additive zero expectation term within a simulation exercise.
Nor is it the case that such effects are small, necessarily, since 'R2's' in
labor supply models are typically not that high, i.e., much unexplained residual
variation remains after the model

has

been specified and estimated. Thus, for a

particular individual we might well expect that careful treatment of the
stochastic specification in calculating the appropriate expectation would be

quite

important.

Yet for the population at large, or equivalently a very large

2

sample, the importance of the stochastic components is unclear. In the sample if
the

variation

of the exogenous variable is sufficiently large and the fit of the

equation sifficiently good, the effect of the stochastic component may be small.
Perhaps a more promising approach is to realize that extremely accurate

computation for each individual may not be needed, because a law of large numbers

type result may hold for the entire sample. That is, rather crude computational
techniques may be used for each individual, but the sample mean values can still

be quite accurate. Significant computational savings occur because say only one
Monte Carlo draw is done for each individual. While the variance of the
predicted response of that given individual may be large, in the complete sample
the large variance may not be

type of technical question is the major focus of this paper.
The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section I we outline the problem of

labor

supply with nonlinear budget constraints. I also specify and use estimates

of a linear supply model. This section and the estimates follow from Hausman
(1979). In Section II the stochastic problems which arise in simulation of
nonlinear budget set models are studied. Both analytical and Monte Carlo

approaches are considered. Comparative statistics for computer times are given
to indicate potential savings from the use of simple computational techniques.

Then, in Section III I consider tax reform proposals. The type of tax reform
proposal considered, is a reduction of tax rates by 10% to 30%. Here we
consider not only labor supply effects and welfare effects, but we also look at

tax revenue considerations. It is important to emphasize at the outset that all

—3—
analysis takes place within a partial equilibrium framework. Thus, general
equilibrium effects which might be quite important, especially in long—run
response, are not treated.

1'• The

Econometrics of Labor Supply with Taxes

The essential feature which distinguishes econometric models of labor supply
with taxes from traditional demand models is the non—constancy of the net, after

tax wage. Except for the case of a proportional tax system, the net wage depends
on hours worked because of the operation of the tax system. Also, the marginal
net wage depends on the specific budget segment that the individual's

indifference curve is tangent to. Thus, econometric techniques need to be
devised which can treat the nonlinearity of the budget set. An econometric
model needs to take the exogenous nonlinear budget set and to explain the

individual choice of desired hours. We first describe such a model for convex
and nonconvex budget sets. As expected, the convex case is simpler to deal with.
We then consider other issues of model specification such as variation in tastes,
and fixed costs to working.

Econometric estimation is quite straightforward in the case of a convex

budget set. Convex budget sets occur due to the operation of a progressive tax
system. Let us first analyze the simplest case, that of a progressive tax on
labor income so that the marginal tax rate is non—decreasing. In figure 1.1
three

marginal tax rates are considered, t1, t2, t3, which lead to three after—

tax net wages, w1, w2, w3, where W = w(l—t1). y denotes non—labor income. H1
and H2 correspond to kink point hours which occur at the intersection of two tax
brackets.

But an important addition to the diagram are the "virtual" incomes Y2

and y3, which follow from extension of a given budget segment to the vertical

axis.

They are denoted as virtual income because if the

linear

budget set B2 =

(w2,y2),

he would still choose hours of work h* as in

figure 1.1. An important property of such convex budget sets in the presence of
strictly quasi—concave preferences, is that only one tangency (at most) will

exist between the individual indifference curves and the budget set. Hausinan

5

Figure 1.1

(1979b) uses this result to demonstrate that only a specification of the labor
supply function is necessary for estimation.

The form of the underlying utility

function is not necessary.

Since a unique tangency or a corner solution at zero hours will determine

desired hours of work, we need only determine where the tangency occurs. To do
so we begin with a slight generalization of the usual type of labor supply
specification
(2.1)

(w,

y, z, ) + C = h* +

where w is a vector of net wages, y is a vector of virtual incomes, z are

the divergence between desired hours h* and actual hours. The typical
specification that has been used in (

and y corresponding to the market wage and nonlabor income. The stochastic term
is assumed to have classical properties so that no quantity constraints on hours

worked exists. However, 0

worked.

We also assume that when the 8's are estimated that the Slutsky conditions are

satisfied so that ( ) arises from concave preferences.
The problem to be solved is to find h* when the individual is faced with the

convex budget set, B for i=1,...,m. To find h* we take the specification of
desired hours on a given budget segment B1

h= g

Calculate h and if 0 <

h < H1 where the H.' s are kink point hours in figure 1 •

then h is feasible and represents the unique tangency of the indifference curves

and the budget set. If h 0, then zero hours is the desired amount of work.
However, if h* exceeds H1 it is not feasible so we move on to try the next budget

segment. If H1 h <H2 we again would have the unique optimum. If we have
bracketed the kink point so that h > H1 and h < H1, then h* = H1 so that

desired hours fall at the kink point. Otherwise we

Then a nonlinear least squares procedures or

unknown

better technique would be to use Tobit which enforces the constraint

0.

The case of the nonconvex budget is more complicated because equation (1.2)
can lead to more than one feasible tangency which leads to many potential hi's.

Non—convex budget sets arise from the presence of government transfer programs.
The

four most important programs of this type are lo income tax credit, AFDC,

Social Security benefits, and a negative income tax (NIT) program. In Figure
1.2

we indicate a common type of non—convex budget set. In Figure 1.2 we have

two tangencies of the indifference curve with the budget set which seems to lead

7

to two potential h*'s.

Figure 1.2

How can we decide which of these feasible hi's is the global optimum?
Burtless—Hausman (1978) initially demonstrated the

technique

of working

backwards from the labor supply specification of equation (2.2) to the
underlying preferences which can be represented by a utility function. The basic

Given the indirect utility function, all of the feasible tangencies can be
compared, and the tangency with highest utility is chosen as the preferred hours

of work, h*. Then as with the convex budget set case, we can use either
nonlinear least squares or a Tobit procedure to estimate the unknown

coefficients. While using a specific parameterization of the utility function
seems upsetting to some people, it should be realized that writing down a labor
supply function as in equation (1.2) is equivalent to writing down a utility

function under the assumption of utility maximization. To the extent that the
labor supply specification yields a robust approximation to the data, the

associated utility function will also provide a od approximation to the
underlying preferences. The utility function allows us to make the global
comparisons to determine the preferred hours of labor supply. The convex case
needs only local comparisons, but the nonconvex case requires global comparisons
because of the possiblility of multiple tangencies of indifference curves with
the budget set.

We next introduce the possibility of variation in tastes. In the labor
supply specification of equation (1.1), all individuals are assumed to have

identical 's so that variation of observationally equivalent individuals must
arise solely from c. However, empirical studies seem to do an inadequate job of
explaining observed hours of work under the assumption of the representative

individual. Burtless—Hausman (1978) allowed for variation in preferences by

permitting

also found that variation in

even nore satisfactory procedure

would be to allow all the taste coefficients to vary in the population. At
present the requirement of ev-aluating multiple integrals over nonrectangular

regions for the more general specification has led to the use of the simple case

of one or two taste coefficients varying. Further research is needed to
determine whether this more complex specification would be an important
improvement over current nodels.

Another consideration which can have an important effect on the budget set

for women's labor force participation is fixed costs to working. Transportation
costs, the presence of young children, and search costs of finding a job can lead

to a fixed cost element in the labor supply decision. The basic effect of fixed
costs is to introduce a nonconvexity in the budget set at the origin. Thus, even
if the original budget is convex as in Figure 1.1 the presence of fixed costs

leads to a minimum number of hours H0, which depends on the wage, below which an

individual will not choose to work. In figure 1.3 nonlabor income is y1 with the

ko

original convex budget set drawn by the dotted line. However, the presence of
fixed costs lowers the effective budget set to the point Yi — FC.

The individual

would not choose to work less than H0 hours because she would be better off at

zero hours. This nonconvexity invalidates the simple reservation wage theory of
labor force participation since hours also need to be accounted for. Hausman
(1979a) in a labor force participation study of welfare mothers found average
fixed costs to be on the order of $100 per month. The importaflce of fixed costs
could explain the often noted empirical fact that very few individuals are
observed working less than 10 or 15 hours per week.

We estimated a model of labor supply (Hausman (1979)) which takes full
account

of the effect of taxation for two groups in the population. The labor

supply of husbands and wives is considered for 1975 for a sample from the
Michigan Income Dynamics Data. Budget sets were constructed using both federal
and state tax regulations, c.f., Hausman (1979). It is important to note that we
did not have access to actual tax return data. Instead, we imputed deductions
beyond the standard deduction using population averages. At present no data
source has both all the necessary labor supply data in addition to actual income

tax return information.1 At the current stage of model development only a single
person can be considered so that the husband was treated as the primary worker in

a family with the wife as the secondary worker. A model which allows for joint
family labor supply decisions seems the obvious next goal of our researtch. For
both husbands and wives we consider each of two cases: a convex budget set where
the effects of FICA, the earned income credit, and the standard deduction are
averaged to produce a convex budget set and a complete nonconvex budget set where
the effect of each program is to introduce a nonconvexity.

Along each segment the basic labor supply model which is used is linear in
the wage and virtual income

and H.. If desired hours

are feasible than we have a tangency of the indifference curve and the budget

use our stochastic specification for the deviation of actual hours from desired

truncated normal across individuals in the population. Thus, we have a Tobit

specification for the hours worked variable. However, if h = 0 we assume that
the individuals do not choose to work and so set h. = 0 also. Since the final
3

model has two sources of stochastic variation the interpretation of

nj differs

from standard models. Here we picture the individual faced by a choice from a
set of jobs which differ in normal (long run) hours worked. He chooses that job

closest to his h*. But observed h may differ due to unexpected layoffs,
short time, overtime, or poor health. As an empirical matter we find the
standard deviation of

to be reasonably small which indicates that

individuals are successful in matching jobs to their desired hours of work. 1a

If the budget set is non—convex M is not necessarily unique because
multiple tangencies can occur between the indifference curves and the budget set.

Then h. is chosen as the tangency which lead to maximum utility which is
determined by use of the corresponding indirect utility function from equation

(1.4) We again use the stochastic specification of equation (1.6) to express the

deviation of actual hours from desired hours of work. It is interesting to

12

note that although certain kink points such as H in Figure 1.2 in the non—convex
case cannot correspond to desired hours, we might still observe them as actual

hours or work due to the stochastic term

in the model.

The second source of stochastic variation in the model arises from a

distribution of tastes in the population. In line with our previous research we

An upper limit of zero is specified since we assume that leisure is a

probability that any amount of hours corresponds to desired hours.. As an

the model which confirms our previous findings reported in Burtless—Hausman
(1978)

The estimated results for husbands are presented along with asymptotic

standard errors in Table 1.1. The coefficients are generally estimated quite
precisely, especially the wage and non—labor income coefficients. The

socioeconomic variables have coefficients of reasonable magnitude except the
house equity which perhaps reflects factors in the mortgage credit market and the

special tax treatment of houses. We first note that the uncompensated wage
coefficient is essentially zero. Not only is the estimate close to zero but the
estimated standard error is quite small. In the extreme case of two standard
deviations from the estimate for the nonconvex case, a change in the net wage of
$1.00 along a budget segment leads to an expected increase in annual hours worked

of 32.5 which is less than 2% of the sample mean. The expected change in hours
is only 11.3 while in the convex case the expected change in annual hours is .2.

The finding of an extremely small uncompensated wage effect is in accord with the

previous empirical findings. Thus the direct effect of income taxation which
reduces the net wage has almost no effect on hours worked among husbands.

However, our results do differ from previous studies in indicating a
siqnificant income effect. Remember that we allow a distribution of preferences
in the population. The estimated probability density for the nonconvex case is

shown in Figure 1.4. The distribution has substantial skewness since it is the
extreme left tail of the truncated normal distribution with the standard

deviation approximately equal to the mean in magnitude. This finding is repeated
in the convex

found

case with the skewness even more pronounced. My previous

work has

this general form even when different probability densities are used,

e.g., Hausman (l979a) where a Weibull density is used. The underlying parameters
of the preference distribution are estimate quite precisely so that the finding
is not likely to be an accidental occurence.

Figure 1.4

Next

we present the empirical results for a sample of married women. Our

sample consists of the wives of the males used in the previous section. Previous
research has indicated that married womenst labor supply decisions are sensitive
to the net wage so that we would expect to find that taxes create both an
important uncompensated wage effect and an income effect as they do for

husbands. As we previously stated, we treat wives labor supply decisions
conditional on husband's earned income. Thus, wives are considered to be

15

secondary workers which may not be a proper assumption. Since in our sample
labor force participation of husbands is near 100% while wives is near 50%

perhaps treating wives earnings conditional on husbands earnings is not a

particularly bad assumption. However, the crucial question is whether husbands
earnings should enter the wives labor supply decision as exogenous non—labor

income. It is probable that some jointness in decision making takes place when
the husband adjusts his hours of work to his wife's earnings. A family labor
supply model would be able to treat these problems better, but here we only

provide estimates for the conditional uvdel.
We turn now to the estimates of the labor supply equations which are

presented in Table 2.2. We present estimates for a convexif led budget set, for
the complete nonconvex budget set, and for a nonconvex budget set with fixed

costs included. First note that we find substantial uncompensated wage and
income elasticities. For the average woman who is working full time we find the
uncompensated wage elasticity to be .995 for the nonconvex results and a similar

magnitude for the convex results, .978, is found. When fixed costs are added the
uncompensated wage elasticity falls to .9065. Thus, all three estimates indicate
that the effect'of the income tax in decreasing the after tax, net wage is

important in determining wives labor supply. Since wives net wage is lowered
substantially by the presence of the 'marriage tax' the tax effect may be much
greater than if wives earnings were not added to husbands earnings for tax

purposes. On the other hand, we also find an important effect of non—labor
income (and actual income). The elasticity at the means is approximately —.2.
This effect causes larger labor supply by wives because their husbands earnings

are reduced by taxes. The two effects have opposite sign so that a simulation is
needed to evaluate the net effect of the marriage tax.
In this section we have presented our specification of labor supply in the

presence of nonlinear convex budget sets and nonconvex budget sets. The
stochastic specification has been emphasized since it will play an important role

in the simulation results. We now consider how the results can be used to
simulate the effects of tax reform. We emphasize computational considerations so
that the simulations can be conducted at low or moderate costs of computer time.

II. Tax Change Evaluation
In this section we develop formulae for expected hours of work, expected tax
revenue, and expected deadweight loss given our model of labor supply and the

estimates of the previous section. The main question that we attempt to answer
in this section is how much attention must be paid to the stochastic components

of the specification to obtain accurate estimates. We consider both analytical
and Monte Carlo approaches to the problem. We want to find accurate and low cost
computational techniques which permit use of simulation methodology. At the sa'!le

time keep in mind the typically large samples which are involved in a

simulation. These large samples make computational techniques an important
consideration. But the large samples may also allow possible simplifications in
computational techniques because of the averaging process used in calculation
of simulation results.

case. Thus, not unexpectedly, we need to consider the complete budget

set when calculating the conditional expectation of hours worked. tax revenue

paid, or deadweight loss and account for the 'endogeneity' of Wij and

Yij. It turns out to be the nonlinearity of the budget set together with the
distribution of preferences specification which cause the significant costs of

labor supply simultaions. As we indicate below, the solution for that part of
the 8 distribution which corresponds to a given budget segment is a non—trivial
calculation.

We first consider the analytical conditional expectation for hours worked.

13

Thus equation (2.3) calculate the expectation of actual hours h. over the range

for which desired hours h. are positive. The first sum in equation corresponds
to the case where desired hours fall along a budget segment, i1,m. The range of

20

8's which causes this to happen are denoted (8.

.,8..).

Note that in the

i—1,j 3

nonconvex case some segzrents may have the ntergral end pOifltS equa1 which means

that desired hours will not fall anywhere on the segment. It is basicaLly this
calculation which leads to the greatest expense in simulation since calculation
of the univariate and b±variate integrals is not that costly. The nonconvox
budget set of Figure 1.2 indicates the possibility of an Lndfference curve which
is tangent to two budget segments simultaneously.

Thus in the nonconvex case

there are portions of the budget segment which cannot correspond co desired

hours. For this possibility to happen, the ndirecc utility fUflCCiOfl Of equation
(1.4) is equal for a given 8 for two sets of w1's and y1ts.

Calculation of

these 8's for each nonconvexity in tlie budget set requires the iterative solution

of a nonlinear equation. Given the further facts that the points of mutual
tangency are unknown and that complete budget segments may be skipped over, the
computations of the (8.

for

all budget segments i1,m is a rather

complicated task. Thus, we look for possible simplifications in simulation to
reduce both the computer costs and the required programming time.
The outer integral in equation (2.3) determines desired hours h*.(B).

we have h.. < 0. Thus q. .(8) =

(8) which is the minimum value of n which

keeps actual hours positive. The second sum in equation (2.3) corresponds to
desired hours falling at one of the m—l curves, or kink points, of the budget

set. The lower limit to the integral, r.., again determines the range for
positive h...
13

Evaluation of the integrals in equation (2.3) is not especially difficult,

even given the bivariate integrals. Conditioning
partial

formulae can be used and known

fraction expansions for univariate integrals lead to quick evaluation.

21

These simplifications follow basically from the linear specifications of h. in

equation (2.1). Unfortunately, the computation of integrals becomes considerably
more complicated when we want to calculate expected deadweight loss due to the

nonlinearity of the expenditure function. The expenditure function which
corresponds to the indirect utility function of equation (1.4) is

The nonlinearity arises from 8 appearing in both the exponential and in the
denominators of the coefficients. For a given 8 deadweight loss is measured by
calculating either the compensated or equivalent variation via

the

expenditure

function of equation (2.4) and then subtracting off compensated taxes paid, using
the definition of Diamond—McFadden (l974)., Hausman (l979c) has demonstrated the

necessity of doing the correct Hicksian measure of consumer's surplus because use
of the incorrect Marshallian measure can lead to very large errors in calculation

of the deadweight loss. For calculation of deadweight loss equation. (2.3) is
altered to account for the deadweight loss for 8's which correspond to zero hours

of work. Otherwise, the general formula remains the same with the main
difference that the nonlinear calculation required for deadweight loss makes

computation considerably more slow than in the case of hours worked which is a

linear function of 8. Conditioning formulae for the integrals are no longer
applicable and quadrature methods to evaluate the univariate and bivariate
integrals are now required.

To evaluate computation techniques we tried four approaches listed in order
of decreasing computational burden on a sample of men in 1975 from the PSID data
base:

22

1. Analytical evaluation, via the computer, of the integrals in equation

(2.3). For the nonlinear deadweight loss calculation we took the
corresponding to the mean B on the interval (.

that

complete quadrature methods were not necessary to evaluate the integrals.

also
Corresponding to 8 we find M. (8) and n. is set to zero. This technique
removes any need for integration for taxes paid or calculation of deadweight
loss.

Note that the second approach leads to unbiased (or consistent) estimates of
the expectation which will have more variance than the actual expectations of the
first approach due to the variance created by the Monte—Carlo draws. However, we

consider a sample of 200 men to see whether the appropriate law of large numbers
works fast enough for this consideration not to be important.

created by apporach (3) since the expectation of .

is

Potential bias is

positive and decreases

along each segment as 8. increases. Lastly, approach (4) creates additional bias
because it runs afoul of the rule that the expectation of a nonlinear function is
not equal, in general, to the. function of the expectation.

Potential problems

arise here for both hours of work and deadweight loss because of the nonlinearity
of the budget set.

In Table 3.1 we consider the four techniques on the first five men in our
simulation file to see what happens at the individual level.

Column 1 gives

actual hours, while the next three columns calculate the expectations of hours

corresponding to methods (1) —

(4).

The next two sets of columns correspond to

the expectation of taxes paid and the expectation of deadweight loss using che
equivalent variation measure.

23

Since method (I) leads to the correct evaluation of the expectation, it
provides the standard of comparison for methods (2) —

(4).

For labor supply we

see that method (2) leads to considerable variance, as expected. Method (3)
which sets n

= 0 gives identical results to method (1). Method(4) which takes

the mean 8 leads to some bias, although only a small amount. For expected
taxes paid methods (3) and (4) again have bias which is somewhat larger in this

case. Lastly, deadweight loss seems most sensitive to the technique which is

used. Techniques (3) and (4) are off by about 7% in these calculations. Thus,
our tentative conclusion for individual calculations is that for labor supply
and taxes paid method (3) is probably an appropriate techniques to use.5
However, for deadweight loss full analytical evaluation of the integrals seems
necessary for accurate calculation of the expectation.

We now turn to the major use of simulation for tax changes. We simulate
over a file of approximately 225 men from the PSID file to see what happens to

accuracy for mean changes. This file was found large enough to capture the
limiting behavior of the different evaluation methods. Note that a substantial
amount of computer processing time is involved here.6 Taking the amount of time
to do method (1) as unity, we find that method (2) takes .560 while method (3)

takes .500 as long and method (4) takes .360 as long. Where many simulations
are done over tax files which have thousands of entries these time consideration

can become quite important. Given the nonlinearity of the problem, the
simulations can take up large amounts of computer time.
Simulation results are given in Table 3.2.

the expansions would require a full scale Monte Carlo study in itself. Yet such
information might be very helpful, especially if the standard errors for the

caclulatjons in Table 3.2 turn out to be sizable. We need to remember that
"parameter uncertainty" does not average out by a large numbers type of result in
simulations because of perfect correlation across sample draws in the use of

parameter values. This area seems to be an important aspect of future research
in the field. We now turn to evaluation of some proposed tax changes in the next
section. Method (3) is used for expected hours and expected taxers while we use
method (1) to evaluate expected changes in deadweight loss.

26

III. Simulation Results
In this section we consider the effect of two different types of tax

systems. The first type of tax is the current U.S. tax on labor income including
both the income tax and payroll tax. We compare it to a no tax situation.
To measure the change in labor supply we calculate the change in expected hours

of work using equation (2.3). The appropriate choice for the change in individual

welfare is not quite as clear. We use the equivalent variation calculated from

the expenditure function of equation (2.4). Choice of the equivalent variation
as the measure of deadweight loss, or the excess burden of taxation, seems
appropriate since we later consider changes from the current system to an altered

tax system. Since in the altered tax system, individual welfare may be higher,

we want to know the cost (in utility) of staying with the current system. But
two possible objections to our measure is that we aggregate across individuals,
giving each individual the same weight in the implicit social welfare function, and
that different individuals are allowed different coefficients in their expenditure

functions. The problems created for analysis of vertical equity considerations by
these choices are discussed in Atkinson—Stiglitz (1976). The latter problem may
not be especially serious since paramter differences arise from a distribution of
preferences which is common to the entire population.

The other type of tax system that we consider is a cut in tax rates of a

given percentage. We consider the expected change in labor supply, the expected
change in tax revenue, and the expected change in deadweight loss from the current

system. Much recent attention has focussed on the revenue effects of a change in
the income tax rates. It is important to note that our analysis is wholly
partial equilibrium in nature. We look only at changes in expected labor supply.
Thus potentially important factors such as changes in market wages and changes in

inputs of other factors of production are not considered. A more complex general

27

equilibrium model is needed to answer these questions. Also since tax revenues
will be decreasing, the problem of compensation arises. The problem of potential
versus actual compensation was the basis of the Kaldor—Hicks—Scitovsky--Snmuelson

—Little debate of the 1940's. Without the choice of an explicit social welfare
function we cannot resolve this problem. But we assume no post—tax
redistribution of income among individuals, since such actual (rather than
potential) compensation is unlikely to take place.

First, we see that deadweight loss rises rapidly with the market wage as we

expected. In terms of the welfare cost of the tax we see that the ratio of
deadweight loss to tax revenue raised starts at 9.4% and rises to 39.5% by the

time we reach the highest wage category. We see that the cost of raising
revenue via the income and payroll taxes is not negligible. In terms of a
distributional measure we see that the ratio of deadweight loss to net income

also rises rapidly. In fact, this measure indicates that individuals in the
highest wage category bear a cost about 10 times the lowest category while

individuals in the second highest category bear a cost 5 times as high. Without a
specific social welfare measure, we cannot decide whether the current tax system

has too much, too little, or about the right amount of progressiveness. But the
measures of Table 3.1 seem an important step in thinking about the problem.
Lastly, note that the change in labor supply from the no tax situation again

rises with the wage category. The high marginal tax brackets have a
significantly greater effect on labor supply than do the low tax brackets.

We now do a similar set of calculations of our sample of wives. While we
found both significant deadweight loss and an important effect on labor supply
for husbands compared to the no tax situation, the situation is more complicated

for wives. First, about half of all wives do not rk. In the absence of an
income tax, the net wage would rise causing some of them to decide to work and

others to increase their labor supply. But, at the same time their husbandst
after tax earnings would also rise which has the opposite effect on labor force

participation. Thus, both effects must be accounted for in considering the
effects of the income tax.

Overall for wives, we find the ratio of deadweight loss to tax revenue to be

18.4%. But it should be remembered that this ratio understates the effect on
labor force participants alone. For labor supply, we find that taxes serve to
increase labor supply in the lowest wage category, but decrease labor supply as

the wage rises. Overall, they decrease labor supply by 18.2%. Thus, again for
wives we see that the current income tax system has both important labor supply
effect and imposes a significant cost in welfare terms for raising tax revenue.

We now turn to a consideration of Kemp—Roth

type tax proposals. We will

consider two levels of tax cuts, 10% and 30%. The question which has been
focussed on most is what effect these tax cuts would have on tax revenues. Our

For wives we do not present detailed quintile results because

the

overall

pattern is similar to husbands. The mean results are given in Table 3.4.
Overall, we see that the labor supply response to a tax cut is greater for wives

than for husbands. We expect this since the wage elasticity is about twice the
income elasticity so we should have a net increase in labor supply. Furthermore
the difference in the elasticities is about four times that of husbands, and we

do observe a significantly larger response. For the 10% tax cut case labor

supply increases by 4.1% and tax revenues fall by 3.8%. For the 30% tax cut case
labor supply increases by 9.4% and tax revenues fall by 16.2%.

Our overall evaluation of the Kemp—Roth tax proposals is that while tax
revenues will decrease by significantly less than the tax cut, overall government

revenue from the income and payroll tax will decline. An argument might be made
that general equilibrium results may be large enough to reverse this conclusion, but

I

doubt that it is a valid

argument, especially in the short run. Thus, unless a

strong argument can be made for reducing
loss from the recipients, the

government expenditures with little welfare

Ketnp—Roth tax cut proposals cannot be supported on the

basis of our results. They certainly do not have the 'free lunch' properties
claimed by some of their supporters.

NOTES

'sample selection criteria and budget set assumptions are discussed in
Hausman (1979). We note that farmers, the self—employed, and severely
disabled individuals are excluded from the sample. Potenta1. proolems of tax
evasion and tax avoidence should be decreased by our sample selection
procedures. Also, for families with incomes which place them above the range
of the standard deduction, we used data from the Statistic of Income which
should capture a large proportion of tax avoidance procedures. But data
problems will nevertheless remain. It certainly seems preferable, however,
to account for taxes rather than to ignore them as is the typical tradition
in the labor supply literature, e.g. Smith (1980), in which only one of seven
papers recognizes the existence of income taxation.
1a1 disagree with my discussant's remarks about his evidence on the
piling up of labor supply at kink points for two reasons. First, the
presence of r. reduces to zero the probability that anyone is observed at a
kink point. 7e would still observe a dispersion of individuals over the
budget set. Second, since the kink points differ for each individual, I do
not see how a casual look at the data gives us more evidence. Lastly, he is
incorrect in his claim that the econometric procedures depend critically on
exact knowledge of the location of the kink points.
2This specification of different tastes for leisure is perhaps the most
controversial part of the model since it represents the most marked departure
from usual labor supply models where coefficients are assumed identical
across individuals. There all population heterogeneity arises through the
additive disturbance term n. , e.g. the labor supply models contained in Smith
(1980). A further discussin is contained in Hausman (1979). To test for
robustness of the specification in Hausman (l979a) I tried different
functional forms for the probability distribution. Also, Burtless—Hausman
(1978) and Hausman (1979) used instrumental variable techniques which do not
depend on normality assumptions. Nor do they depend on the normal good
assumption for leisure. The results were quite simliar to the full maximum
likelihood model estimates. I disagree with my discussant's remarks on the
robustness of the procedure. My investigations lead me to believe that the
procedures I use are considerably more robust than the reservation wage model
of labor supply with its unsupported proportionality assumption. For
instance, in his latest estimates which ignore the existence of taxes,
Heclnan (1980, p.229), my discussant's estimate of the uncompensated labor
supply elasticity for wives changes from 2.1 to 4.8 with only a minor change
in econometric specification. Both estimates are quite high with the latter

• estimate absurdly so. My estimates are considerably more robust to
econometric specification as the labor supply elasticities for the three
different budget sets of Table 1.2 indicates.
3other definitions are discussed in Auerbach—Roser' (1980).

4The women's sample might be better than the men's sample for testing
this option because the sensitivity around zero hours for a man is probably
quite small. Thus biases are not apt to be important for men. However,
subsequent simulations have indicated that while the bias is slightly larger
for women, it is still probably small enough to be ignored.

5Method (4) may also be satisfactory for a first approximation.
6Wh.ile relative computer costs are difficult to compare, a simultaion on
the full sample of 1000 families on the MIT computer costs around $60.

7When we refer to the current tax system, we are actually using the 1975
data which the model was estimated with. However, except for the rise in
social security contribution, the taxation f labor income has not changed
significantly since 1975.
