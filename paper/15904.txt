Getting Cars Off the Road: The Cost-Effectiveness of an Episodic Pollution Control Program

ABSTRACT
Ground-level ozone remains a serious problem in the United States. Because ozone non-attainment
is a summer problem, episodic rather than continuous controls of ozone precursors are possible. We
evaluate the costs and effectiveness of an episodic scheme that requires people to buy permits to drive
on high-ozone days. We estimate the demand function for permits based on a survey of 1,300 households
in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. Assuming that all vehicle owners comply with the scheme,
the permit program would reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by 50 tons and nitrogen oxides
(NOx) by 42 tons per Code Red day at a permit price of $75. Allowing for non-compliance by 15 percent
of respondents reduces the effectiveness of the scheme to 39 tons of VOCs and 33 tons of NOx per
day. The cost per ozone season of achieving these reductions is approximately $9 million (2008 USD).
This compares favorably with permanent methods of reducing VOCs that cost $645 per ton per year.

Getting Cars Off the Road:
The Cost-Effectiveness of an Episodic Pollution Control Program
Maureen L. Cropper, Yi Jiang, Anna Alberini, and Patrick Baur
I. INTRODUCTION
While such major air pollutants as sulfur dioxide and particulate matter are substantially under
control, many areas of the United States remain in non-attainment of the ground-level ozone
standard. Indeed, 322 of the 675 counties that monitor ozone are currently in violation of the
standard.3 This includes the counties that make up the Washington Metropolitan Area.4
Non-attainment poses a serious public health problem because ozone has significant and
well-established adverse effects on the respiratory system (U.S. EPA 2003).
Because ozone non-attainment is a seasonal problem, it is possible to employ episodic rather
than continuous control of ozone precursors. Ozone is formed when oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in the atmosphere. High temperature and sunlight
facilitate the process. As a result, peak ozone levels typically occur on hot, sunny days from May
to September. Seasonality implies that implementing episodic controls could well be cheaper than
requiring investments that remain in place year round, even during seasons when NOx and VOCs
are unlikely to react to form ozone.
One form that episodic controls might take is to reduce driving on summer days when ozone
levels are predicted to be high. Motor vehicles are estimated to account for 56 percent of NOx and
45 percent of VOC emissions nationwide (U.S. EPA 2003). In addition, the
environmental-engineering literature suggests that controls on mobile sources could be more
effective than controls on stationary sources for certain areas. Episodic automobile
emissions-control programs do exist in some areas. Previous research, however, has documented
that these programs have little success in keeping vehicles off the road on high-ozone days because
they are all implemented on a voluntary basis.
The purpose of this study is to examine the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of an episodic
control scheme under which people would not be allowed to drive during predicted ozone episodes
unless they purchase a permit before the ozone season begins. On-road vehicles failing to display
the permit would be subject to a fine. Such a scheme is expected to be more effective than
voluntary schemes because it incorporates an incentive for people to restrict driving on high-ozone
days. It also might be cheaper than schemes requiring installation of additional capital equipment

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the area consists of the District of Columbia;
Montgomery, Prince George’s, Frederick, Calvert, and Charles counties in Maryland; and Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun,
Prince William, and Stafford counties and Alexandria City of Virginia. This definition differs from the Census
definition of the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

on vehicles or factories.
This paper measures the cost of this scheme by estimating the permit demand curve for the
Washington Metropolitan Area. A stated-preference approach is used, based on a survey of more
than 1,300 Washington-area commuters. The survey asked each respondent whether he would
purchase a permit to drive on high-ozone days during the ozone season, for each vehicle owned, at
a stated price. The permit price was varied among respondents to trace out the demand curve for
permits. We use the responses to this question to determine the cost associated with a given
emissions-reduction requirement, forecast what types of vehicles will be taken off the road, and
assess the cost-effectiveness of the scheme (i.e., the cost per ton of emissions reduced). The study
also allows us to investigate political acceptability of the scheme and the distribution of costs
among income groups.
We focus on the Washington Metropolitan Area for three main reasons. First, like other
densely populated urban areas of the United States, the Washington Metropolitan Area has long
suffered from severe ozone problems. On average, the ozone level exceeded the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) eight-hour standard on 16.7 days each year from 2001
to 2009. The benefits of effective ozone control should be significant to the residents in the area.
Second, the fact that the Washington area has a VOC-limited ozone regime, implying that
reductions in VOCs are needed to reduce ambient ozone, favors restricting automobile emissions
rather than controlling stationary sources. Third, the existing public transportation system in the
area makes it possible to substitute alternative travel modes for driving. Although the project is
specific to the Washington Metropolitan Area, our study provides insights into the feasibility and
cost-effectiveness of similar programs in other ozone non-attainment regions.
Briefly, we find that the demand for permits (i.e., the probability of purchasing a permit for a
vehicle during the ozone season) is negatively related to the price of the permit. All else the same,
the demand for permits increases with miles driven, especially when a vehicle accounts for a large
share of the total miles driven by a household, and is higher for newer vehicles. Drivers with small
children are more likely to buy permits, all else the same, but income, race, and ethnicity are not
important, suggesting that this scheme is not regressive. Even at low permit prices (e.g., $75 for
the ozone season), the scheme would reduce VOC emissions by 39–50 tons on a high-ozone day,
depending on whether we allow for non-compliance (and little or no enforcement effort) or assume
full compliance.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the nature and cost of
ozone regulations in the United States, briefly reviews the literature on voluntary episodic controls
of ozone precursors, and describes the theoretical constructs relevant for such schemes. Section III
describes our study design and sampling frame. We describe the characteristics of our sample
households and the vehicles they own in section IV, which also presents raw data on permit

3

demand. In section V, we present econometric estimates of permit demand and calculate the cost
and effectiveness of the program. Section VI concludes.
II. REGULATORY CONTEXT AND LITERATURE REVIEW
Colorless and odorless, ground-level ozone is a key component of urban smog and has
deleterious effects on human health (U.S. EPA 2003). It can cause severe damage to lung tissue,
reduce lung function, and sensitize lungs to other irritants. Individuals who engage in outdoor
physical activity (such as children) or persons who have preexisting respiratory diseases are at
greater risk from exposure to ozone. In addition to the adverse effects on human health, ozone
reduces agricultural and commercial forest yields and increases tree and plant susceptibility to
disease, pests, and other environmental stresses.
Ozone is one of the six major air pollutants for which the U.S. EPA sets National Ambient Air
Quality Standards. EPA first introduced an ambient ozone standard in 1979 by setting a daily
maximum one-hour average ozone level. Studies later found that adverse health effects occur at
levels lower than the 1979 standard and that exposure times longer than one hour are also of
concern. In July 1997, EPA proposed replacing the one-hour primary ozone standard with a new
eight-hour standard to better protect the public from ozone. Attainment of the standard requires the
3-year average of the annual 4th-highest daily maximum 8-hour concentrations be less than or
equal to the standard. The 8-hour standard was set at 0.08 ppm in 1997 and revised to 0.075 ppm
in 2008. The Washington Metropolitan Area has been designated by EPA as an 8-hour ozone
non-attainment area since the 1997 standard was phased in.5 Table 1 shows the monthly
distribution of ozone exceedance days for the Washington Metropolitan Area from 2001 to 2009.
On average during this period, ozone exceedance days numbered 16.7 per ozone season. Note that
exceedance days are concentrated in June, July, and August, when the temperature and intensity of
sunlight are greatest.
To battle the urban ozone problem, federal and state governments have adopted a variety of
strategies, including reducing NOx emissions from power plants and industrial combustion sources;
encouraging the use of cleaner fuels, including reformulated gasoline; improving transit systems;
and implementing vehicle inspection programs. Despite these efforts, many regions—particularly
major cities—still fail to meet the ozone standard. One explanation lies in the dramatic increase in
the number of cars on the road and the miles they travel. Total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) rose
by 36 percent from 1990 to 1999 in the Washington Metropolitan Area and are predicted to rise by
10 percent between 2002 and 2009 (MWCOG 2007).
The environmental engineering literature suggests that controls on mobile sources could be
more effective than controls on stationary sources for certain areas (Heuss et al. 2003). According
5

The area was also designated as a one-hour ozone non-attainment area before the eight-hour ozone standard took
effect.

to U.S. EPA’s National Air Quality and Emissions Trends reports, such major U.S. cities as Los
Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, are VOC-limited—that is, the ratio of VOCs to NOx
is very low. NOx reductions in these areas essentially raise the ratio of VOCs to NOx to a level
promoting ozone formation. Therefore, VOC-limited areas will benefit from a disproportionate
reduction in VOCs (Heuss et al. 2003). Since the dominant source of VOCs is often motor vehicles
burning gasoline, rather than stationary sources, some researchers suggest that the least costly and
most effective means of reducing ozone under a VOC-limited regime may be to reduce emissions
from light-duty gasoline vehicles (Fujita et al. 2003).
The episodic nature of ozone formation favors control measures that are implemented only on
high ozone days. Economists have demonstrated that in theory, abating pollution only when
pollution episodes are forecast is more economically efficient than undertaking continuous
abatement (e.g., Teller 1967; Krupnick 1988). Unfortunately, relatively few studies have
empirically examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of episodic programs. Lutter (1999),
however, notes that the cost of reducing precursor emissions through conventional measures is
very high, when correctly calculated. For example, if the cost of reducing one ton of VOCs over
the course of a year through year-round control measures is $10,000, this is equivalent to an annual
cost of $3.65 million to reduce VOCs by one ton each day, as would be required to reduce VOCs
by one ton per day during the ozone season.
Local governments have implemented episodic emissions-control programs targeting mobile
sources in a number of regions, including Northern and Southern California, Atlanta, and the
Baltimore/Washington metropolitan areas. However, the voluntary nature of these programs raises
concerns about their effectiveness. Henry and Gordon (2003) and Cummings and Walker (2000),
using survey data and traffic counts data, respectively, examine whether people drive less in the
Atlanta Metropolitan Area on the expected high-ozone days. Neither study provides convincing
evidence that the program effectively reduces driving. Jiang (2009) shows that ozone alerts only
resulted in a slight decline in morning inbound and evening outbound traffic in the Baltimore area.
Cutter and Neidell (2009) study how people respond to high-ozone alerts in the San Francisco Bay
Area. They find that “Spare the Air” announcements reduce total daily traffic by 2.5–3.5 percent,
with the largest effects during and just after the morning commuting periods, but have a negligible
effect on subway ridership. The authors conclude that voluntary programs of this kind are unlikely
to result in improvement in air quality.
Existing evidence demonstrating the ineffectiveness of voluntary programs suggests the need
for a permit scheme that provides sufficient incentives for people to forgo driving. People who are
not seriously inconvenienced by switching to another mode of travel are unlikely to pay to drive,
whereas those who cannot switch easily or who value driving privileges highly will buy a permit.
Driving without a permit will be effectively deterred if accompanied by monitoring and
enforcement. The critical economic questions are whether a permit system produces sufficient
emissions reductions (and thus prevents high-ozone episodes from occurring) and whether it does

5

so in a cost-effective way.
The total emissions reductions and the cost of reducing ozone through a permit scheme
depend on the shape of the demand function for permits. At the margin, the permit price should
equal the value of driving forgone. The demand function for permits thus represents the marginal
value of not driving. For a given supply of permits, the cost of reducing ozone precursor emissions
can be approximately calculated as the area under the permit demand curve to the right of quantity
of permits purchased (area A in Figure 1). To determine the emissions reductions associated with
this cost, one must know the characteristics and annual mileage of vehicles for which permits
would be bought at that price.
In this paper, we survey residents of the Washington, DC, metro area, asking them whether
they would buy permits at a given price in the presence of a no-driving scheme. The price of the
permit is varied across respondents. We use the responses to these hypothetical questions to trace
out the demand for permits, compute how many vehicles would stay off the road on a high-ozone
day, and calculate the cost to the vehicle owner/driver.
III. STUDY DESIGN
The data used to evaluate an episodic ozone control program for the Washington metropolitan
area come from a survey of 1,312 area commuters conducted in January–March 2008 by Abt SRBI
International. In this section, we briefly describe the questionnaire and its administration and our
sampling frame.
A. The Questionnaire
The survey instrument collected information on household demographics, vehicle ownership
and usage, and willingness to pay for a permit to drive on high ozone days. We developed the first
draft of the questionnaire following the framework of the Nationwide Personal Transportation
Survey, with an added section regarding local air quality and the hypothetical permit program.
Thereafter, the questionnaire was subject to multiple revisions through focus groups and
one-on-one in-depth interviews (see Appendix A).
The final questionnaire consisted of five sections. The beginning section asked screening
questions to identify a valid respondent: a household head (or the spouse of a household head) 18
or older who had a valid driver’s license, drove at least a few days a month, and was a member of
a household that owned at least one vehicle.6 It also collected basic information on the number of
household members and number, make, and model year of vehicles the household owned.

6

Our sampling plan required an even number of men and women; hence the respondent could be either the head of
household or the spouse of the head of household.

6

The second section surveyed each vehicle owned by the household in detail, up to a maximum
of three vehicles. For households owning more than three vehicles we asked about the three
vehicles driven most often.7 For each vehicle, we collected information on type, fuel type, mileage,
miles driven within the past 12 months or since being purchased, and its primary purpose.
Depending on the main use of the vehicle, we asked about the average number of days it was
driven for this purpose each week, one-way distance driven, presence of a second passenger, and
the destination to which it was driven (city or zip code). The respondent was also asked to name
the household member who primarily drives the vehicle and provide information on his or her
relationship to the respondent, employment situation, ability to work from home, and difficulty of
substituting public transportation for driving.
The third section briefly asked about the respondent’s perceptions of local air quality, his
perceived impact of air pollution on household members’ health, his familiarity with smog alerts
(Code Red warnings), and his estimation of the number of Code Red days in 2007.8
The fourth section began by describing air pollution in the Washington area, its adverse effect
on health, and the predictability of bad air quality days. Before describing the permit program, the
interviewer stated, “One way to reduce air pollution on these days is to ban the use of personal
vehicles, except in emergencies. This would reduce harmful emissions.” Then, the respondent was
asked how he would get around if driving were banned on a bad air quality day. In particular, he
was asked how likely he would be to work (stay) at home, take public transportation, take a taxicab,
bicycle/walk, or drive anyway.
The interviewer then introduced the permit program: “Now, suppose the government were to
issue a limited number of permits to allow people to drive on bad air quality days. These permits
would be for sale in April and would allow people to drive on all bad air quality days during the
summer. People found driving without a permit on a bad air quality day would be issued a ticket.
This would result in a fine and points on their driver’s license. The revenues from selling permits
and from fines would be used to improve public transportation in order to reduce harmful
emissions. … If you bought a permit you would receive a decal to display on your windshield. The
decal could not be transferred from one car to another. …” The respondent was also informed that
“Although the total number of bad air quality days that will occur is not known when the decal is
purchased, we do have some information about previous years. The average number of bad air
quality days for the past five years has been 14 days per year.”
A permit price was presented to the respondent, who was asked whether he would purchase a
permit at this price for each vehicle owned. The permit price was randomly selected from six
7

About 7 percent of households in the final sample owned more than three vehicles and were therefore affected by this
rule.

Code Red days are days that are forecast to be high-ozone days. The hypothetical permit scheme would require a
vehicle to have a permit in order to be driven on a Code Red day.

candidate prices ranging from $75 to $1,000.9 The interviewer asked people who would not buy
any permits why and how likely they would be to do the following on the bad air quality days:
work (stay) at home, carpool with someone who had purchased a permit, take public transportation
or a taxicab, bicycle/walk, or drive without a permit. We also asked how likely the driver of one
vehicle not covered by the permit would be to choose each of these options on bad air quality days.
The last section collected information about household demographic and housing
characteristics, income, residence location, as well as the proximity of household to various public
transportation facilities.
B. Survey Administration and Sampling Frame
Abt SRBI conducted pretests and implemented the survey (see Appendix A) via telephone.
The survey began on January 29, 2008, and finished on March 9, 2008, with 1,203 completed
households. The response rate, defined as completes plus screen-outs divided by all eligible phone
numbers called, and the cooperation rate, defined as completes plus screen-outs divided by eligible
households excluding non-contact and unknown households,10 are 0.159 and 0.331, respectively.
After removing the 306 screen-outs, the ratios of completed interviews to all eligible numbers
called and eligible numbers excluding non-contact and unknown households are 0.127 and 0.264,
respectively. Since 109 of the second round of 180 pretests (see Appendix A) shared the same
survey instrument as the final survey, we pooled them with the final survey sample together to
enlarge the sample size to 1,312 usable interviews.
To better capture the geographical distribution of vehicle ownership in the survey, we
designed a simple sampling framework in combination with random-digit dialing. Using 2000
Census micro data,11 we calculated the share of each county-level jurisdiction within the survey
region in terms of number of households owning at least one vehicle. The survey sample was
required to mimic this distribution. Table 2 reports the distribution of the pooled sample across
jurisdictions and the corresponding shares obtained from the 2000 Census. It shows that
implementation of the sampling framework was quite successful. The biggest gap occurred in
Fairfax County, VA, where about 16 households were oversampled. Figure 2 maps the locations of
these respondents.

9

See Table 7 for the exact amounts.
The denominator is the sum of completes, screen-outs, partial interviews, refusals and break-offs, and others.
11
This is the latest data set available that allows us to do the calculation. It is plausible to think that the distribution has
not changed dramatically since 2000.

IV. HOUSEHOLD AND VEHICLE DATA
A.

Characteristics of Sample Households and Their Vehicles

Table 3 describes the characteristics of our 1,312 survey respondents. The target population
was heads of household or their spouses over 18 years old who drive to work and own at least one
vehicle. Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 91, with an average age of 49. Fifty-three percent of
respondents were female. Sixty-seven percent of respondents were white, 21 percent black, and 6
percent Hispanic.12
The economic and educational status of respondents reflects the fact that Washington, DC, is
an affluent metropolitan area. Eighty-one percent of respondents owned their own homes.
Respondents were highly educated: 65 percent had a bachelor’s degree or better, and 32 percent
had a graduate degree. Twenty-one percent of respondents refused to disclose their household
income. Of those who did report this information, 63 percent had household incomes of $80,000 or
higher, and 26 percent had incomes of $150,000 of higher. Thirty-eight percent of households
owned one vehicle, 41 percent two vehicles, 14 percent three vehicles, and 7 percent four or more
vehicles. Vehicle ownership by our households matches closely data from the 2006 American
Community Survey. With regard to other household characteristics, it is difficult to obtain
distributions of income and education conditional on car ownership.
Tables 4 and 5 describe the characteristics of vehicles owned by the households in our sample.
Sixty-one percent of the vehicles owned by households are cars; 37 percent are SUVs or other
light-duty trucks. Twenty-seven percent of vehicles are model year 2005 or more recent; 61
percent are 2001 or more recent. Average annual miles driven (11,900 per year) correspond closely
to the national average. More than half of the vehicles (54 percent) are used primarily for
commuting to work, 22 percent primarily for running errands, 5 percent to go to school, and 5
percent to drive to public transportation. Table 5 describes the joint distribution of miles driven and
vintage. On average, newer cars are driven more miles than older cars.
Table 6 describes the VOC and NOx emissions of the vehicles in our sample. Vehicle
emissions of the common air pollutants (in grams per mile) depend, among other factors, on the
type of vehicle (car, truck, motorcycle), fuel used (gasoline or diesel), and model year. We have
matched emissions factors (grams/mile) for NOx, VOCs, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter
from Mobile 6 (Davidson 2009) to the vehicles in our dataset based on these criteria. Emissions
factors are estimates for the year 2010 and cover model years 1986–2008. Multiplying each
vehicle’s emissions by miles driven provides an estimate of total emissions per vehicle per year.
Although miles driven are higher for more recent model years, these cars are also cleaner. As a
result, the average grams of pollutant emitted per year increases with vehicle vintage. For example,
12

The questionnaire was administered in Spanish as well as English.

9

the average VOCs emitted by vehicles in the 1986–1993 vintage category are 16 times the
emissions of vehicles in the 2005–2008 vintage category.
B.

Scenario Acceptance and Raw Data on Permit Purchases

Table 7 presents raw data on permit purchases, as a function of permit price. Only 5 out of
1,312 respondents refused to answer the permit-demand question, while 48 were uncertain
whether they would purchase a permit. We have coded both “Don’t Know” and “Refused” as not
buying a permit. The percent of cars for which a permit is purchased declines monotonically as a
function of permit price: 48 percent of vehicles are covered by a permit at a price of $75, falling to
16 percent at a price of $1,000.
We asked respondents who stated they would not purchase a permit why they would not and
found that 14.4 percent of households objected to the permit scheme on principle. Four percent of
respondents objected to the government interfering with their right to drive; 2 percent objected to
the program as another form of taxation. Some respondents believed that the program favored the
rich (about 2 percent), while 2 percent believed that it was inappropriate to sell the right to drive.
We also asked respondents what they would do on a Code Red day if they did not have a permit.
Approximately 15 percent of respondents said they would be “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to
drive anyway. We term these individuals non-compliant.13
Who are people who would not comply with the permit scheme? Table B.1 in Appendix B
presents estimates of a probit model to explain non-compliant respondents. Briefly, (stated)
non-compliance is more likely among those respondents who live far away from public
transportation and among persons with less than a graduate degree or some graduate education (the
omitted education category). The latter effect is more pronounced for respondents with a
high-school degree or some college than for college graduates, which may reflect less flexibility in
the respondent’s work schedule. Income, race, and ethnicity are not associated with (stated)
non-compliance, and even the price of a permit is only weakly associated with (stated)
non-compliance.
In the next section we first estimate permit demand based on all respondents, including
non-compliers. These results are used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the scheme assuming
full compliance. (In this scenario the non-compliant buy no permits and are assumed to stay off the
road on high-ozone days.) We then estimate permit demand, eliminating people who say they
would not comply with the permit scheme. If the permit scheme does not apply to those
respondents who would not buy a permit and continue driving without a permit (15 percent of the
total respondents, or 16 percent of the vehicles covered by our survey), then it would be possible to
attain emissions reductions only from the remainder of the vehicle fleet (84 percent of the
13

Only 40 percent of people who made verbal statements about the program said they would drive without a permit. We believe that
the latter statement is the appropriate measure of non-compliance.

vehicles).
V. ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATES OF PERMIT DEMAND
A. Econometric Model
We posit that an individual will buy a permit for vehicle j at the stated price if the utility of
driving that vehicle on a Code Red day is greater that the utility of not driving it, even though the
permit costs money. Formally, the individual will buy the permit for vehicle j if
U ( driving , y  P )  U ( not driving , y ) ,

(1)

where y is income and P permit price. This is equivalent to stating that the individual buys the
permit if his or her willingness to pay for it is greater than the price of the permit. The probability
of purchasing a permit for vehicle j is thus:
Pr( Permitij )  Pr(WTPij*  Pij ) ,

(2)

where i denotes the individual and WTP* is the unobserved willingness to pay for a permit.
We further assume that WTPij*  exp(x i β  z ij γ )  exp( ij ) , where x is a vector of individual or
household characteristics, z is a vector of vehicle characteristics, and  is an econometric error
term, implying that

Pr( Permitij )  Pr(x i β  z ij γ   ij  ln Pij ) .

(3)

We assume that the marginal distribution of  is a zero-mean normal. However, we wish to allow
for the possibility that unobserved factors within a household affect all permit purchase decisions
for that household. In other words,  ij   i   ij , where  is a normally distributed zero-mean
variate and  is an independently and identically distributed error with mean zero and variance one.
Both  and  are uncorrelated with x and z;  and  are also independent of one another. It follows
from these assumptions that  is correlated across the vehicles within a household (the correlation
coefficient being Var ( ) /(1  Var ( )) but independent across households. This results in a
random-effects probit model.
B. The Effect of Permit Price on Demand
Table 8 presents the results of random-effects probit regressions where we suppress x and z,
and the only regressor is the log of the permit price. Panels A–D differ only in that specific
observations were excluded from the sample as indicated to check the robustness of the results.
Comparison of panel A with panel B implies that it is reasonable to treat a failure to answer the

11

permit question as a “no,” whereas panels C and D imply that the estimated coefficients are very
stable to excluding vehicles for which we do not know the mileage or the model year. As shown in
the table, the coefficient on the log of the permit price is always negative and significant, as
expected, and the estimates for the different runs are extremely close to one another.
As shown in Figure 3, which is based on run A, the model does a very good job of predicting
the actual relative frequencies of the purchases at any given permit price. Figure 3 also confirms
that it is appropriate to enter the log of the permit price (as opposed to the price) in the probit
model.
B. The Impact of Vehicle and Household Characteristics on Permit Demand
Economic theory suggests that the higher the cost of not driving a vehicle, the greater the
chance that the respondent will buy a permit at the stated price. Individuals should be more likely
to buy permits for vehicles that they drive more frequently, account for a larger share of the miles
driven by the household, and are used primarily for commuting or as part of someone’s job, or
when there are few or no public transportation alternatives. We also believe that individuals with
heavy family demands, and especially those with small children, will find it more difficult to
substitute an alternative mode of transportation for driving and will therefore be more likely to
purchase a permit.
Based on these considerations, we fit several specifications of the random-effects probit
models.14 We report specifications that include vehicle characteristics (miles driven, vintage, type
of vehicle, and driving purpose) in Table 9. Specifications that check whether individual or
household characteristics influence the decision to purchase a permit are displayed in Table 10.
Table 9 shows that, given the price, the likelihood of buying a permit increases monotonically with
the number of miles a vehicle is driven each year (conditional on knowing annual mileage). This
effect is strong and robust across specifications. The effect of the model year is more difficult to
interpret. Respondents are more likely to buy permits if their vehicles belong to any one of the four
indicated vintage categories (1986–1993, 1994–2000, 2001–2004, and 2005–2008) than to the
reference group (pre-1986). The coefficients on the dummy variables for these vintage categories
are large, but they are estimated imprecisely and suggest a non-monotonic relationship between
the age of the vehicle and the probability of a permit purchase. The larger the share of the total
driving within the household that is accounted for by this particular vehicle, the more likely is the
respondent to purchase a permit for this vehicle. The coefficient on this variable is large (about
0.60) and strongly statistically significant, with p-values on the order of 10-5 or smaller.

14

To preserve model comparability, all models are estimated using the set of 2,233 vehicles, with indicator variables

used to capture the effects of missing data.

12

To get a sense of the magnitude of the above effects, we created four hypothetical vehicle
“profiles.” Profiles 1 and 2 are vehicles driven less than 10,000 miles a year, with model years in
the 1986–1993 and 1994–2000 categories, respectively. Profiles 3 and 4 are vehicles driven more
than 15,000 miles a year that belong to the 2001–2004 and 2005–2008 model year categories,
respectively. In each case, we assume that the vehicle accounts for 61 percent of the total miles
driven within the household (the sample average). Under these assumptions, if we set the permit
price at $100, the predicted probability of purchasing a permit is 31.8 percent for profile 1 and 42.4
percent for profile 2—a large increase. At higher miles driven, and with a newer vehicle, the
likelihood of purchasing the permit at the same price is 59.6 percent for profile 3, and 56.3 percent
for profile 4.
Specifications B–D show that ease of access to public transportation and the specific type of
vehicle (whether it is a car, a pickup truck, a van, or a sport utility vehicle) do not have a
statistically significant impact on the decision to purchase a permit. We measure the impact of
public transportation in two ways. One is to ask how easy it would be for the main driver of each
vehicle to use public transportation rather than drive the vehicle. For 13 percent of the drivers, it
would be “very easy”; for 26 percent, either “very easy” or “somewhat easy.” The second is to ask
how far the household is from a bus stop, the Metro, or a MARC commuter train. Approximately
70 percent of households are within a mile of a bus or Metro stop. Neither variable has a
statistically significant effect on permit demand, although their coefficients have negative signs.
Model D suggests that households are no more likely to buy a permit for a car, pickup truck, van,
or SUV than for a recreational vehicle or motorcycle (the omitted category).
Specifications C and D, however, suggest that use patterns matter. For example, respondents
are more likely to buy a permit for vehicles that are driven to work, for work (e.g., by a plumber or
carpenter), or to school—all of which are presumably regarded as non-discretionary travel.
In Table 10, we report the results of specifications that examine the effect of individual and
household characteristics on the likelihood of purchasing a permit. The impact of
sociodemographic variables on permit demand is clearly of interest for policy purposes; however,
household income and respondent education and gender have no statistically significant effect on
permit purchase. Because income affects vehicle ownership and miles driven, we estimate a set of
models that exclude these variables. Income in the survey was recorded in a series of intervals. We
have modeled income as a series of dummy variables and also as a continuous variable equal to the
midpoint of the reported interval. Models A and B report the impact of log(income) on permit
demand, controlling for gender, presence of young children in the household, and race. Although
income is positively related to permit demand, it is never significant at the conventional levels.
Models B and C add respondent education to the model. Respondents with a high school education
or less appear more likely to purchase permits than respondents with a graduate degree or some
graduate training (the omitted category), but this, too, is not significant at the conventional levels.
Respondent gender has no effect on permit demand.

13

The only demographic variables that appear to affect permit demand are race and the presence
of small children in the household. Whites are significantly less likely to purchase a permit
(holding income and education constant) than Blacks and the omitted group (Asians and Native
Americans). We also find that among the respondents who did provide information about the
composition of their household, those respondents who have small children are more likely to
purchase a permit at any price.
C.

Calculating the Cost and Effectiveness of the Permit Scheme

To predict the number of cars that will not be driven under the scheme and the resulting
reduction in vehicle emissions, we need to know how permit demand varies with vehicle emissions.
We focus here on VOC emissions; however, we obtained similar results for NOx emissions. When
permit demand is estimated as a function of annual VOC emissions per vehicle and the log of
permit price, annual VOC emissions have no statistically significant effect on demand—either
linearly or when interacted with permit price. (This is also true for NOx emissions.) Although
vehicle owners are more likely to purchase permits for cars that are newer and driven more miles,
new cars are substantially cleaner than older cars, even when the older cars are driven fewer miles
(see Table 6). Thus, from the perspective of predicting the reduction in vehicle emissions, we can
ignore vehicle characteristics and focus on permit demand as a function of permit price alone.
To predict the reduction in miles driven and the cost of the permit scheme, we must evaluate
the probability of purchasing a permit, as a function of permit price, for prices below $75—the
lowest price offered in the survey.15 Table 11 shows the predicted probability of purchasing a
permit for a randomly chosen vehicle, as a function of price, using model A from Table 8. The
aggregate demand for permits is the demand curve in Table 11 multiplied by the number of
passenger vehicles in the metropolitan area. According to the National Capital Region
Transportation Planning Board (2006), approximately 2.0 million passenger vehicles and 1.2
million light-duty trucks were registered in the Washington Metropolitan Area as of June 1, 2005;
hence, we treat the number of vehicles as 3.2 million.16
What is the cost of the episodic control scheme? Table 11 implies that free permits would
cover virtually all vehicles. Raising permit price to $75 would reduce the percent of vehicles
covered by approximately 44 percent.17 The lost consumer surplus associated with a permit price
of $75 for each vehicle not driven is the shaded area in Figure 1. Assuming 14 Code Red days per
season, the opportunity cost of getting each vehicle off the road is $0.614 per day. Multiplying this
by the number of vehicles removed (0.44*3.2 million), implies a welfare cost per Code Red day of
15

Because demand is a function of ln(permit price), the lowest price used is $1.
The exact numbers are 2,004,089 passenger vehicles and 1,180,563 light duty trucks (National Capital Region Transportation
Planning Board 2006).
17
It should be noted that not all registered vehicles in the metropolitan area are driven every day. We account for this by calculating
VOC emissions based on the average miles driven per day.
16

14

approximately $863,000.18
How would this affect emissions? Multiplying the number of vehicles removed by average
daily tailpipe emissions implies that a permit price of $75 per season would reduce emissions on a
Code Red day by 49.6 tons of VOCs, 42.2 tons of NOx, 552.5 tons of carbon monoxide and 0.231
tons of particulate matter. This implies a cost per ton of VOCs abated of approximately $17,400
per Code Red day. Raising permit price above $75 would further reduce emissions but would
significantly increase the cost per ton of VOCs reduced (see Table 11).
Of course, the episodic control scheme also would raise revenue. At a price of $75, the sale of
permits would raise approximately $119 million in revenue. In addition to reducing VOCs, the
scheme would have benefits in terms of reduced traffic congestion and reductions in other
pollutants.
D. The Cost of the Scheme with Less than Full Compliance
The calculations presented in previous sections assume 100 percent compliance, as is usual
when examining the impact of proposed regulations. However, about 15 percent of our
respondents said that if the permit program were enacted, they would be “very” or “somewhat”
likely to drive without a permit. In this section we examine program cost-effectiveness figures
under an alternate scenario—one with less than full compliance and no (or limited) enforcement
effort. If the permit scheme does not apply to those respondents who would ignore the program and
continue driving without a permit (15 percent of the respondents, or 16 percent of the vehicles in
our survey), then it would be possible to attain emissions reductions only from the remainder of the
vehicle fleet (84 percent of the vehicles).
When we exclude from the sample those respondents who insisted that they would continue
driving without a permit, the likelihood of purchasing a permit is higher at any given permit price.
To illustrate, at $75, the fraction of vehicles that would be covered by a permit is 47.66 percent for
the full sample and 54.21 percent for the “compliant” sample. At higher prices, the percentage of
vehicles covered by a permit is about 4–6 percentage points higher in the compliant sample than in
the full sample. Permits priced at $1,000 would cover 18.03 percent of the compliant respondents’
vehicles, compared to 16 percent for the full sample. We note, for the purpose of calculating
emission reductions, that excluding the non-compliant respondents leaves the average annual
emissions of NOx and VOCs virtually unchanged.
A random-effects probit model of the responses from the compliant owners confirms that at
any given price, the likelihood of purchasing a permit is greater than for the full sample. The slope

18

This ignores the revenue implications of the scheme and tax interaction effects. Permit revenues should equal approximately
$119 million per season at a permit price of $75.

15

of the demand function with respect to permit price, however, is similar.19 When we include
driving patterns and characteristics of the vehicle in the random-effects probit models, the results
(displayed in Appendix B, Table B.2) are, for the most part, similar to those of the models for the
full sample in Table 9. The decision to purchase a permit appears to depend in virtually the same
fashion on the log of the permit price and the miles driven but is somewhat less strongly associated
with the model year of the vehicle. One difference between the two sets of results is the impact of
vehicle type: cars and pickup trucks are more likely to be covered by a permit in the compliant
sample than in the full sample.
The impacts of sociodemographic variables on permit purchase (displayed in Appendix B,
Table B.3 for the non-compliant sample) are similar for the two samples: income has no
statistically significant impact on permit purchase, but respondents with young children are more
likely to purchase a permit. Whites are less likely to purchase a permit than non-whites, all else
equal. One difference between the two samples is the effect of education. In the compliant sample,
respondents whose highest level of education is a high school degree (or less) are more likely to
purchase a permit relative to persons with some graduate education, and the effect is significant at
the 5-percent level.
Using the basic random-effects probit with no covariates, we predict the number of vehicles
that would not be driven under the permit scheme (out of 3,200,000*0.84=2,688,000 eligible
vehicles), the associated emissions reductions, cost per ton of VOCs, and cost of the total
emissions reductions attained per day (Table 12).
On the basis of a cost per ton of VOCs, the two programs are virtually identical. However, less
than full compliance clearly limits the emissions-reduction potential of the episodic control
scheme. For example, at a permit price of $75, only 38.6 tons of VOCs would be reduced each day,
against the 50 tons achieved under a full-compliance scenario. Still, at a cost of $9 million for a
14-day high ozone season, the episodic control program remains attractive when compared to
conventional controls. Using the $5,000 cost per annul ton of VOCs reduced, the total cost for the
same reduction in VOCs (38.6 tons) would be $70 million.20
VI. CONCLUSIONS
The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a vehicle permit scheme
compared to other methods of controlling ozone precursors. Ozone in Washington, DC, is
VOC-limited, implying that the goal is to reduce emissions of VOCs on what are predicted to be
high-ozone days. The welfare cost of the scheme is approximated by the area under the demand
curve for permits to the right of the quantity of permits issued (Figure 1). We estimated this cost
19

When the full sample is used, the estimated coefficients from a random-effects probit are 1.818256 (intercept) and -0.425366
(coefficient on log bid). The compliant sample results in a larger intercept (1.997979) and a virtually identical slope (-0.4290023).

Standard errors for all key measures of the accomplishments of the program are based on the approach described in Krinsky and
Robb 1986.

16

based on a survey of more than 1,300 Washington-area commuters conducted in 2008. Our
calculations suggest that a permit price of $75 per season would remove approximately 44 percent
of cars and light-duty trucks from the roads on high-ozone days, assuming full compliance with the
scheme, and 34 percent of passenger vehicles, allowing for non-compliance. Focusing on the
non-compliance scenario and assuming 14 high-ozone days in an average summer, the program
would cost approximately $648,000 per day in lost consumer surplus and would result in
approximately 38.6 fewer tons of VOCs emitted per day, at a cost of $16,800 per ton of VOCs
removed per high-ozone day. The program would also raise approximately $111 million in revenue
per ozone season, which could be used to defray administrative costs.21 Raising permit price above
$75 would increase the effectiveness of the scheme but would also raise the cost per ton of VOCs
removed, due to the steepness of the demand curve for permits.
How does the cost of the episodic scheme compare with the cost of year-round controls? In
2004, the U.S. EPA declared the Washington, DC, region in moderate non-attainment of the
eight-hour ozone standard (U.S. EPA 2004). The Metropolitan Washington Council of
Governments (MWCOG) submitted a plan outlining steps to make reasonable progress toward
attainment over the 2002–2009 period (MWCOG 2007). One goal was to reduce VOCs by 87 tons
per day (from the 2002 baseline) by 2009. Most reductions were to come from reduced emissions
from non-road engines under the federal non-road gasoline and diesel rules. Although the cost of
individual control options is not specified, MWCOG (2007) describes an economically feasible
control strategy as one with a cost of $5,000 per ton of VOCs per year or less. The U.S. EPA (2008),
in its Regulatory Impact Analysis for the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Ozone, also
capped the cost of reducing VOCs at $5,000 per ton per year.22 This corresponds to a cost of
365*$5,000 to reduce a ton of VOCs every day, or $70.4 million annually to meet the 38.6 ton
reduction delivered by the episodic control program at just $9 million. This suggests that a
program such as described here could be a cost-effective way of reducing ozone precursors on
high-ozone days.
Another way to compare the cost of the episodic program with the cost of year-round controls
is to convert the cost of the episodic control scheme into the cost of an equivalent year-round
scheme. If the cost of reducing a ton of VOCs over the course of a year were $645 (instead of
$5,000) it would cost $645*365 = $235,000 to reduce a ton of VOCs every day. The cost of
meeting the 38.6 ton reduction would be $9.07 million—the cost of the episodic program. So, the
episodic control program is equivalent to a program of permanent controls costing $645 per ton of
VOC reduced per year.
Concerns may arise about the possible regressivity of the episodic control scheme. It appears
from our estimates, however, that such a scheme is not regressive. The demand for permits is not

In the full compliance scenario, 55 percent of compliant vehicles would be covered by a permit at a price of $75.
The U.S. EPA notes that this cost will not be sufficient to achieve the proposed, stricter ozone standard.

significantly related to income and/or education, although non-whites appear to be more likely to
purchase a permit. Finally, it should be noted that the scheme is progressive to the extent that
people who do not own a car (who are likely to be poor) will benefit from air quality improvements
while bearing none of the scheme’s costs.

Appendix A. Development of the Survey Instrument
As a first step in designing the survey, the authors arranged four focus groups, comprising 38
Washington-metropolitan residents who drive to work, in Rockville, Maryland; and Vienna and
McLean, Virginia. We hired a graduate student from the Program in Survey Methodology of
University of Maryland as moderator. The moderator prompted participants to talk about area
traffic and their commuting experience, their perceptions of local air quality, and any thoughts
about the permit program as described by the moderator. Open-ended questions solicited minimum
and maximum willingness to pay for the permit. Consensus existed among the groups that traffic
conditions are far from pleasant—and are worse in Northern Virginia than in Maryland. Many
participants also linked local air quality (smog) to massive traffic.
While some people appreciated the episodic permit program, others gave frank concerns and
opinions about the program. Members of the focus groups commonly raised questions regarding
the cost-effectiveness and fairness of the program, the few alternatives available to driving, and
use of program revenues. The discussions also touched on many details of program
implementation and enforcement. For instance, would medical emergencies be exempted from the
permit program? When people were presented with a choice between a decal attached to the
windshield and an electronic chip installed in the car, they were inclined to choose the former, as
the chip would result in an intruding, “Big Brother” effect. The majority of the stated amounts
people would pay for a permit—which allows vehicle owners to drive on 14 days during ozone
season (based on historical averages)—ranged from $10 to $500. Overall, the focus groups were
highly informative and helpful in improving the questionnaire.
Edge Research Inc. then conducted one-on-one in-depth interviews to fine-tune the
questionnaire. The firm recruited twelve participants, demographically representative
Washington-metropolitan residents who commute by driving. A professional moderator from Edge
Research led each participant through the entire questionnaire, making sure that the participant
could easily understand and answer all questions. Each interview took between 45 and 60 minutes.
After each interview, the moderator briefly discussed the participant’s responses to and comments
on the questionnaire with the authors, who observed the interview behind a one-way mirror. The
questionnaire was then updated in real time. The in-depth interviews helped us adjust the structure
of the survey instrument and make its language clearer and more accurate.
We initially intended to administer the survey to 1,500 households, divided into 300 pretest
households and a formal sample of 1,200. Abt SRBI Inc. programmed the questionnaire into the
CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing) system in early December 2007. A pretest of
120 households was carried out in the middle of December 2007. The authors listened to some of
the interviews and decided to further adjust the survey, especially the section on vehicle use. Abt
SRBI conducted the remaining 180 pretests between January 16 and January 24, 2008. No
additional changes were found necessary. Our final sample thus consisted of 1,200 households

36

plus 109 households in the second pretest who received the same design values for permit price as
households in the final survey.
