ABSTRACT
Studies of US intergenerational mobility focus almost exclusively on the transmission of
(dis)advantage from parents to children. Until very recently, the influence of earlier generations
could not be assessed even in long-running longitudinal studies such as the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID). We directly link family lines across data spanning 1910 to 2013 and
find a substantial “grandparent effect” for cohorts born since 1920, as well as some evidence of a
“great-grandparent effect.” Although these may be due to measurement error, we conclude that
estimates from only two generations of data understate persistence by about 20 percent.

I. Introduction
Research since the mid-1970s on rising inequality in the US (e.g. Piketty and
Saez 2014) has been accompanied by increased attention from economists on a
related topic of long-standing interest among sociologists, equality of opportunity
and intergenerational mobility, generally measured as the correlation across
generations within family lines in economic and social status. Though research on
intergenerational mobility has advanced dramatically over the past two decades,
with a proliferation of methodological improvements (Solon 1992; Mazumder
2005), data sources (Hendren et al. 2014; Feigenbaum 2015a; Feigenbaum 2015b;

1

Hilger 2016; Clark et al. 2015; Grusky et al. 2015), and international comparisons
(Björklund and Jäntti 1997; Solon 2002; Bourdieu, Ferrie, and Kesztenbaum
2009; Long and Ferrie 2013), this work has focused almost exclusively on the
transmission of (dis)advantage from parents to their children. The influence of
grandparents and earlier generations, if addressed at all, is inferred through
iteration of the parental influence, a procedure that is unsatisfying in a number of
respects (Stuhler 2012).
The focus on just parents and children has been primarily due to practical
considerations: few longitudinal studies have been running long enough to capture
the experiences of three or more generations through adulthood in the same
family lines. Yet there are several reasons why we might expect that grandparents
would matter. Mare (2011) describes several channels through which generations
prior to parents could have an impact on children's outcomes, including
inheritance of financial assets, inheritance of social networks, and the direct
effects that personal contact between grandparents and their grandchildren could
have in a society where increasing longevity means their lives will increasingly
overlap.
The inability to assess a “grandparent effect” also shapes how we view, in a
purely statistical sense, the parent-child transmission process. As Solon (1992)
notes, an intergenerational correlation will be biased downward by measurement
error in the parent generation. However, information on grandparents can reduce
the impact of this downward bias, even if we are only interested in parent-child
transmission (Solon 2014).
Finally, the presence of a grandparent effect has been detected in many of the
places where it has been possible to look for it: rural China (Zeng and Xie 2014),
Sweden (Lindahl et al. 2015), Britain (Chan and Boliver 2013), Germany (Hertel
and Groh-Samberg 2014), Chile (Celhay and Gallegos 2015), Denmark (Boserup
et al. 2013) and even the pre-WWII US (Olivetti et al. 2014, Long and Ferrie

2

2012). In fact, one of the few places where such an effect has not been
consistently observed is the modern US. Warren and Hauser (1997), using the
Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, found no independent grandparent effect, though
Mare (2011, p. 16) warns that “mid-twentieth century Wisconsin families may be
a population in which multigenerational effects are unusually weak.” One paper
using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) has found a grandparent effect
(Hertel and Groh-Samberg 2014), but neither Hodge (1965), Behrman and
Taubman (1985), nor Peters (1992) found one.
We contribute to the research on multigenerational mobility in several ways.
We link family lines from the 1910, 1920, and 1940 US Censuses of Population to
the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplements
(ASEC) of the 1970s and 1980s and to the 2000 US Census of Population Long
Form (LF) and the 2001-2013 American Community Surveys (ACS). From these
linkages, we construct one four-generation sample and two three-generation
samples.1 We measure mobility across generations using educational attainment
(years of schooling), which suffers from less measurement error than single-year
observations of income.2 Our ability to observe many of the same individuals at
multiple points in time (for example, many individuals can be observed as adults
in both the 2000 LF and the 2001-2013 CPS ASEC) allows us to directly assess
the degree of measurement error in reported education. Finally, we link both
males and females throughout the 1910-2013 period we examine, making it

1

The structure of our data also allows us to examine change over time in the two-generation parent-child transmission of
(dis)advantage. In Ferrie, Massey, and Rothbaum (2016), we show that mobility in educational attainment has fluctuated
across cohorts born since 1895: mobility fell as access to high schools expanded in the early twentieth century, then rose
quickly and fell as the GI Bill expanded access to post-secondary education following World War Two.

There is now a substantial literature on the challenges in estimating intergenerational income elasticities with noisy data
on parents’ and/or children’s incomes. See Mazumder (2015).

possible to assess differences in the effects of male and female ancestors as well
as differences in outcomes for males and females.3
Although we find a grandparent effect in our regressions, we find strong
evidence that it is due to measurement error.

All of our multigenerational

coefficients for grandparents and great-grandparents are consistent with an AR(1)
process of intergenerational mobility of education measured with error. We find
that estimates of intergenerational mobility of education using two generations of
data nonetheless underestimate persistence by approximately 20 percent. As
discussed in Solon (2015), there are multiple possible interpretations of a
grandparent effect. Although our results suggest measurement error, we also
assess the long-term persistence implied if we assumed the effect were causal, and
mobility followed an AR(2) process.

We find that the magnitude of the

underestimate of long-term persistence is the same whether the grandparent effect
is causal or due to measurement error.
II. Data
Constructing Family Dynasties.–To create a four-generation sample that spans the
twentieth century, we use the complete count 1910, 1920, and 1940 Censuses, the
1973, 1979, and 1981-1990 CPS ASEC, the 2000 Long Form Census, and the
2001-2013 ACS. Throughout the analysis, we use males and females of all races
and countries of origin. We refer to adults in the 1910 and 1920 censuses as the
Great-grandparent generation. Those in the 1940 census are the Grandparent
generation, and adults in the CPS ASEC are the Parent generation. Finally, adults
in the 2000 Census and ACS, are the Child generation. These generations, which

3

The baseline estimates in this paper include all children, regardless of gender, race, or place of birth. In the appendix
(Appendix Table 3), we include a table showing separate results by the gender of children and their ancestorst.

4

we capitalize as proper nouns, refer to the data source and general age cohorts of
the adults in each sample.
We employ Person Identification Keys (PIKs), assigned by the Census Bureau,
to link individuals across data sources from 1940 forward. PIKs are assigned by a
probabilistic matching algorithm that compares characteristics of records in
census and survey data to characteristics of records in a reference file constructed
from the Social Security Administration (SSA) Numerical Identification System
(or Numident) as well as other federal administrative data. These characteristics
may include Social Security Number (SSN), full name, date of birth, address,
place of birth, and parents’ names depending on the information available in the
census or survey.4 The PIK uniquely identifies a particular person and is
consistent for that person over time. The PIK thus allows us to link individuals
across data sources.
The figure shows the process by which links are created; each box represents a
single household. We begin with a sample of both male and female children
assigned PIKs in the 1940 Census. We observe these children living with their
parents in 1940, creating the parent-child link between the Grandparent and
Parent generations (1). We then search for the Parent generation’s PIKs in the
1973, 1979, and 1981-1990 CPS ASEC (2). From this linkage, we observe the
outcomes of the Parent generation as adults and create another parent-child link
from the Parent to the Child generation by observing the Parent generation
residing with their own children in the CPS ASEC (3). We then locate the PIKs of
the Child generation in the 2000 LF or the 2001-2013 ACS (4).
We use two approaches to link families from the 1910 and 1920 censuses to the
1940 Census. First, because the 1910 and 1920 censuses did not collect education
4

PIKs correspond one-to-one with a particular SSN. See the appendix for more information on our record linkage
techniques.

STEPS IN THE LINKAGE PROCESS
attainment, we use probabilistic matching techniques to link individuals at least
25 years of age in 1910 and 1920 to 1940 to pick up years of schooling (5). We
use first and last name, middle initial, age, and birthplace to conduct the linkage.5
Next, we create family units in 1910 and 1920, identify children of parents linked
to 1940 (6), and link those children forward to 1940 (7), again using probabilistic
matching techniques. This allows us to observe education attainment for the
Great-grandparent generation and link them to their children in the Grandparent
generation, observed as adults in 1940.
We use an additional approach to match female Grandparents in 1940 back to
their 1910 or 1920 childhood observation. First, we construct family units in the
1940 Census (1). Then we use the PIKs assigned to children to link to the
Numident, which contains the mother’s maiden name. We then append the
mother’s maiden name to the mother’s 1940 record and conduct the record
linkage back to 1910 or 1920 using maiden name instead of the reported surname
(the reverse of link (7)). Consequently, the sample of 1940 children for whom we
observe a parent in the Great-grandparent generation depends on (i) successfully
linking the Great-grandparent generation individual from 1910/1920 to 1940 to
5

We describe our process to link 1910 and 1920 to 1940 in more detail in the appendix.

obtain education attainment (which necessitates the Great-grandparent surviving
until 1940) and on (ii) whether the female Grandparent observation received a
PIK in the 1940 Census.6
We rely on the reported relationship to household head to establish parent-child
relationships and identify spouses. We omit subfamilies in the 1910, 1920, and
1940 censuses, but we include subfamilies observed in the CPS ASEC. We
require that adults fall between the ages of 25-55 when we observe their education
attainment. We also require that the age observed for a record across multiple data
sources are within a five-year interval around what we would expect. For
example, if a person is 3 years old in 1940, we expect that person to be roughly 53
years old in the 1990 CPS ASEC, and we drop this observation if they are
younger than 48 or older than 58 years old.
The Great-grandparent-Grandparent-Parent generation sample (data from 19101990) includes matched children from the Parent generation in the CPS ASEC
and their parents from the 1940 Census. Their grandparents from the Greatgrandparent generation in the 1910 and 1920 Censuses are added to the data set
when available, but are not required for inclusion of the other two generations in
the sample. Great-grandparent generation observations are available for about
10% of the sample (3,517 individuals from the Parent generation).7 The
Grandparent-Parent-Child sample (data from 1940-2013) includes matched
6

Linkage of Great-grandparents implicitly requires survival from 1910/1920 to 1940. The life-expectancy of someone who
survived to be 20 to 50 years old in 1909-1911 is 62.7 to 70.4 years, and the life-expectancy of someone who survived to
be 20 to 50 years old in 1919-1921 is 65.6 to 72.2 (Arias 2015). Consequently, most of the adults we observe in the GreatGrandparent generation from the 1920 Census were expected to live until 1940, but survival to 1940 would have been
much lower for those 50 years and older in 1910. If higher-educated individuals tend to have higher levels of education
attainment (Lleras-Muney 2005), the necessity for the Great-Grandparents to survive from 1910 to 1940 may bias our
results. In Figure 1, we plot reported education by year of birth and by decennial census. We also include the combined
1910-1940 and 1920-1940 linked samples (denoted as 1910-1940 Linked Sample). If higher-educated individuals live
longer, we would expect to see higher average education lines for those born in earlier years and survived to the later
censuses. This figure shows that 1960 and 1940 lie right on top of each other, as do the 1950 and 1970 censuses. This
suggests the relationship between education and survival is small during this time period.

Results restricted to children in the Parent generation for whom at least one grandparent in the Great-grandparent
generation is observed are shown in Appendix Table 1.

children from the 2000 LF and 2001-2013 ACSs, their parents from the CPS
ASEC, and their grandparents from the 1940 Census. For this sample, children are
included only if we observe at least one parent and at least one grandparent.
Measuring Education Attainment.–The 1940 Census was the first U.S. federal
census to collect information on schooling. Respondents reported both highest
grade of schooling completed and whether they were attending school on March
1, 1940. The 1940 census requested schooling information from all respondents,
unlike subsequent decennial censuses that limited education questions to sample
line individuals or the Long Form sample. The 1973-1990 CPS ASEC also
collected highest grade completed. The 2000 Census and the 2001-2013 ACS,
however, collected education attainment in categories. We construct a years of
schooling variable for the 2000 Census and ACS that is consistent across all data
sources from the education categories.
Measurement error in reported income is a well-documented problem in
intergenerational analyses (Mazumder 2005 and 2015, Nybom and Stuhler 2016,
Haider and Solon 2006, Böhlmark and Lindquist 2006, Grawe 2006). In the
absence of multiple observations of income or administrative earnings data,
education attainment may provide mobility estimates less biased by measurement
error. Unlike data sources used in other educational mobility studies, we can
compare education of the same individual reported at two points in time to test
whether this assumption holds.
We have data on education attainment from three time periods: 1940, 19731990, and 2000-2013. Through record linkage, we observe education attainment
at two points at time for a large number of individuals from the Grandparent,
Parent, and Child generations. This allows us to examine whether education

8

reporting in 1940 was measured with significantly greater error relative to later
years and to assess differences in education reporting over time more generally.8
We report differences in observed education attainment from a sample of 25-55
year olds in 1940 linked to the CPS, a sample of 25-55 year olds in the CPS
linked forward to 2000-2013, and a sample of 25-55 year in the 2000 Census or
2001-2007 ACS linked to the 2007-2013 ACS in Figure 2.9
The top row of Figure 2 shows the distribution of the difference between
reported years of schooling at time ! + # and time !. For each linked sample, the
difference in reported years of schooling appears tightly centered around zero.
The lower row of figures shows the average difference between reported years of
schooling (education at ! + # minus education at !) for each grade level at time !
plotted against the distribution of years of schooling at time !. This line shows
that differences in reported education are greatest for those with the least
education. However, only a small portion of the education distribution falls within
the lowest levels of education attainment. For the majority of grade levels, the
difference in reported years of schooling between time ! and ! + # is within one
year. To more formally test whether the descrepancies in reported education
across surveys behave non-classically, we regress education at time ! + # on
education at time ! and several interaction terms to account for age, sex, race, and
socioeconomic status.
Table 1 reports the regression of education attainment at time ! + # on
education attainment at time !. The bivariate regressions in Columns 4, 6, and 8
reveal high levels of correlation between reported education at time ! and ! + #.
8

Goldin (1998) and Goldin and Katz (2000) argue that educational attainment in 1940 may be reported with error due to
non-standardized education systems within and across states, the eventual standardization of middle school and high school
that occurred from 1910 to 1940, and potential misunderstandings about answering the education attainment questions for
the first time in a census.
9
We require that 6 years pass between the first observation of education attainment and the second observation of
education attainment for the 2000-2013 linked samples.

9

When we add covariates to the regression of highest grade completed from the
CPS on highest grade in the 1940 Census in Column 5, sex appears to be the
greatest predictor of differences in reported education. Men underreported their
education by a third of a year in 1940 on average and there is a small, statistically
significant coefficient on the interaction of the male dummy variable and
education attainment, suggesting men with higher education levels in 1940 tend to
report more similar levels of education attainment in the CPS. Otherwise,
equivalent reporting of education attainment in the CPS and 1940 Census appears
unrelated to age, race, and occupational prestige.
Columns 6 and 7 of Table 1 show the regression results from the CPS linked
forward to the 2000 Census and 2001-2013 ACS. For these cases, men with more
schooling in the CPS are more likely to report the same level of education
attainment in the CPS and black and other-race respondents with more education
are less likely to report the same level of education attainment in the CPS. These
coefficients, although statistically significant, are small in magnitude. The
regressions in Columns 8 and 9 exhibit similar patterns with the addition of
income and age as statistically significant predictors of education attainment at
time ! + #. Although the interaction terms suggest some degree of non-classical
error (at least in observables) in the reporting of education, the small magnitudes
of these coefficients suggest small changes in the gap between education reported
at time ! and ! + #, even for large differences in income.
Differences between reported education across surveys may result from proxy
response, errors in recall, differences in questionnaire design over time,
respondents acquiring more education as adults, or general confusion over how to
respond. It is impossible to disentangle the sources of error and each dataset may
be affected by one source of error more than another. The 1940 Census, for

10

instance, was the first census to collect education information and asked for the
“highest grade of school completed.”10 The convention of “common” schools
(e.g., grammar school instead of graded schools) may result in misreported
completion of secondary school as respondents may not have known how to
correctly translate their own education experiences into grade numbers (Goldin
and Katz 2000).11 The vast expansion and standardization of education in the US
between 1910 and 1940 may improve our measure of education attainment for
young adults observed in 1940 (Goldin 1998), but our linked data show that, even
within the Grandparent generation (born between 1885 and 1918), there is
inaccurate reporting despite standardization of the education system.
Our results in Table 1 dispel some of the concerns surrounding accuracy of
education reporting in the 1940 Census. Although there appear to be greater
differences between reported education in the CPS and the 1940 Census relative
to the CPS-LF/ACS linked sample and the LF/ACS-ACS linked sample, age in
1940 is not a significant predictor of education in the CPS. This suggests that
Grandparents who were deciding whether to enter high school in 1899 were not
any less consistent in their later-life education responses in the CPS as
Grandparents entering high school in 1932 – in spite of the standardization of
middle school and high school that began in 1910. We further examine the idea
that adults in 1940 may better recollect their education attainment or that the
translation between grade school and years of schooling became more concrete
over time in Figure 1. This figure shows average education attainment by year of
10

Respondents who never attended school or whose highest year of schooling was from 1-8 had that number reported,
those who attended high school had their highest high school grade reported preceded by the letter “H” (so a respondent
who attended high school only through sophomore year was recorded as “H2”), and those who attended post-secondary
school had their highest post-secondary grade reported preceded by the letter “C” (so a respondent who attended college
only through junior year was recorded as “C3”). The highest grade reported was “C5” for respondents who attained any
years of schooling following four years in college.
11
The enumerator instructions provided some guidance: “For a person who completed his [sic] formal education in an
ungraded school or a foreign country, enter the approximate equivalent grade in the American school system, or, if this
cannot readily be determined, the number of years the persons attended school.”

11

birth and Census source for all individuals (native and foreign-born) under the age
of 85. Generally, average education attainment from the 1950-1970 censuses are
within half a year of the average from 1940. Thus, recollection is not a great
source of error in education reporting.
The discrepancies may arise, in part, from the transition from collection of
highest grade completed towards the collection of education categories beginning
in 2000. Categories that capture education milestones (e.g., graduation from
college or high school) may be easier for survey respondents to recall. In the 2008
ACS, the number of categories changed, allowing us to see if reporting
differences were smaller for years when the categories remained unchanged. If we
limit the regressions in Columns 8 and 9 to the years 2000-2007, the regression
results are nearly identical. This implies that even when the survey questions are
identically measured and the years between recollection are fewer, we can still
expect small differences in reported education attainment over time for the 25-55
year old population. We explore how measurement error affects our estimates of
mobility in the Results section.
Age, Education, and Sample Selection.–Inclusion into the linked samples requires
observing a parent and child living together and successfully linking that child to
their adult observation in another data source. If we are more likely to link certain
types of records, these requirements may bias the sample. We show the summary
statistics for our two three-generation samples in Tables 2 and 3. In both cases,
there are statistically significant differences between the full samples of adults in
the surveys and those selected into our baseline regression samples that results
from our ability to match across generations. For example, in Table 3, individuals
in the regression sample in the Child generation are more likely to have a college
degree and less likely to not have completed high school. However, given the
changes in the US population over the period, especially from immigration, it is

12

not clear that large differences between the regression and full samples are a
concern. What we would like is a counterfactual full sample of children whose
grandparents resided in the US, which is not available.
Instead, we focus on the differences between the regression and full samples at
the Grandparent generation, as in both cases inclusion in the regression is
conditional on matching between at least the Parent and Grandparent generations.
In the Great-grandparent-Grandparent-Parent generation sample in Table 2 we see
that 1940 individuals in the regression sample are younger on average by 3.5
years than the full sample. This is likely because we are conditioning on matching
with their children observed as late as in the 1990 CPS, 50 years later. However,
the educational attainment numbers differ only slightly between the samples.
Taking the difference between the regression and full samples, age is statistically
significant different (-3.5 years), as are years of schooling (0.37 years), share with
some college education (-0.3 percentage points), and share with a graduate degree
(0.2 percentage points). There are also statistically significant differences between
the full and regression samples of the Parent generation. However, as before we
do not observe the counterfactual Parent generation whose parents (Grandparent
generation) resided in the US in 1940.
We see the same pattern in the Grandparent generation in the GrandparentParent-Child generation sample in Table 3. Comparing the regression and full
samples, we find statistically significant differences of comparable magnitudes as
above: age (-3.7 years), years of schooling (0.44 years), and the share with less
than high school education (-2.2 percentage points), high school education (1.1
percentage point), some college education (-0.3 percentage points), and graduate
education (0.2 percentage points).
Tables 2-3 suggest a small degree of sample selection. However, education
attainment is similar across the full and regression samples for the oldest
generation in each intergenerational and multigenerational sample, which is the

13

only generation for which we observe the counterfactual population. We further
examine sample selection in the Results section.
III. Empirical Specification
We regress the years of schooling of the child on the highest observed years of
schooling in each ancestor generation, which can include parents, grandparents,
and great-grandparents.12 In each case, we include fixed effects for the survey
year that each generation is observed, $% (for ! ∈ 1973, … , 2013),13 along with
age and age-squared terms for the child and age and age-squared of the parent in
each generation, /0 .14 To measure mobility across three generations, we regress
the child’s years of schooling on the maximum observed years of schooling for
both the child’s parents, 1 − 1, and grandparents, 1 − 2:
(1)

304 = 6 + 78 30498 + 7: 3049: + α/0 + $% + <498,49: + =04 .

As the number of observed grandparents varies across children, we also include
fixed effects for whether we observe each of the four possible grandparents,
<498,49: . This controls for differences in the grandparent-child relationship that
may differ across grandparents. For example, the years of schooling of the
maternal grandmother may be more or less correlated with child education than
the years of schooling of the paternal grandfather. We do the same for our fourgeneration sample, with fixed effects for each of the eight possible greatgrandparents:

12
In Appendix Table 3, we also show results using different measures of education in the prior generation (e.g. average
education, the education of each ancestor observed). Our choice of measure does not change the results we present.
13
This is only relevant for the parent and child generations, which are observed across multiple surveys.
14
The age terms are included to capture any education increases that may occur in adulthood as well as differences across
cohorts in education.

In all the regressions, for each child generation 1, the errors are clustered at the
1 − 1 generation level. We require the child to be at least 25 years old when
observed as an adult and the highest-educated spouse in each ancestor generation
must be between 25 and 55 years old when they are observed as adults in the prior
generations’ survey.
We also report correlation coefficients for each regression. Figure 3 shows how
the distribution of education attainment has changed from the Great-grandparent
generation to the Child generation. Because the variance of education has
decreased over time, our OLS regression results are scaled by the relative
standard deviations of the different generations in each regression. For example,
the coefficient on the parent’s education is:
F

78 = @

To disentangle changes in the correlation from changes in the variance, we
normalize years of schooling to have mean 0 and variance of 1 in each generation
such that the correlation regression coefficient 78 = @.
IV. Results
Multigenerational Mobility of Education.—Our data allows us to compare
multigenerational mobility across two three-generation samples. With three
generations, we can determine whether grandparent education predicts child
education conditional on parent outcomes, which we call a grandparent effect.
Before we move to the third generation and consideration of the extent to which
ignoring it biases our perceptions of mobility, we present baseline results on twogeneration mobility in Table 4. There are five other sources to which these two-

15

generation results can be compared: (1) Couch and Dunn (1997) use the 1984 and
1988 PSID and report intergenerational correlations between 0.40 and 0.43,
compared to our 0.42 to 0.44 in Panel B; (2) Hertz et al. (2007) who use data from
the 2000 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and focus on adults age
20-69 and find an intergenerational correlation of 0.46 compared to our 0.42 to
0.44 in Panel B; (3) Hilger (2016) who uses a very different methodology and
focuses on children when they are age 26-29, finding regression coefficients that
range from 0.37 to 0.40 for whites and 0.24 to 0.40 for blacks for 1960-2000,
compared to our 0.36 for both races combined in Column 2 of Panel A; (4) the
Occupational Change in a Generation 1973 cohort (OCG73) for males born 192540 which yields a correlation of 0.47 compared to our 0.44 in Column 1 of Panel
B; and (5) the General Social Survey (GSS) which yields a correlation of 0.43 for
children born 1925-40 compared to our 0.44 in Column 1 of Panel B and yields a
correlation of 0.50 for children born 1960-85 compared to our 0.42 in Column 2
of Panel B. With the exception of the GSS 1965-85 birth cohorts, then, our twogeneration results are broadly similar to those obtained in other studies and with
other samples and methodologies.15
There are two shortcomings in all the work to which we have just compared our
two-generation results: (1) they cannot account for measurement error; and (2)
they cannot account for the effect of generations prior to the parents. We have
already shown (Table 1) that educational attainment is reported with error. We
now turn to three-generation mobility and report the grandparent-parent-child
regression and correlation coefficients in Panels A and B of Table 5. The
grandparent coefficient is statistically significant in both samples for both the
15

Hilger (2016) examines individuals age 26-29 and still co-resident with their parents (with adjustment for the
experience of their non-co-resident siblings). The ISSP, OCG73, and GSS asked respondents at the time they were
surveyed to report both their own education and the education of their parents. The comparison study closest in design to
ours is the PSID which actually recorded parents’ education when their children were young and then recorded the
education of those children when they were themselves adults.

16

regression and correlation coefficients. In other words, conditional on parent
education, grandparents matter in predicting the educational outcomes of children.
We add great-grandparents to our three-generation sample to create a fourgeneration sample spanning data 1910-2013 and individuals born between 1885
and 1988. In our sample of 10,890 children with matched parents and
grandparents, we are able to match 1,444 to at least one of their eight possible
great-grandparents. We test if great-grandparent education is associated with child
education, conditional on parent and grandparent education, shown in Table 5, as
well. We do not find a statistically significant relationship between education of
the Great-grandparent and Child when controlling for both the Grandparent and
Parent.
These results suggest grandparents directly influence their grandchildren
beyond their indirect effect through the parents while great-grandparents have no
discernable effect. Several studies also find independent grandparent effects in
non-US countries using a variety of mobility measures (Lindahl et al. 2015; Zeng
and Xie 2014; Hertel and Groh-Samberg 2014; Chan and Boliver 2013; Boserup
et al. 2013), though the influence of grandparents is generally larger outside the
US. These findings imply that an AR(1) process does not fully describe mobility
in

the

twentieth

century

and

undermine

conclusions

drawn

about

multigenerational mobility from two-generation samples. However, it is important
to emphasize that the grandparent relationship may not be causal and could
spuriously arise as a result of measurement error, omitted group effects, cultural
inheritance, or other unobserved factors (Solon 2015). Using linked data, we can
explore how measurement error affects our estimates.
Mobility and Measurement Error.—Using our linked individual data, we find
evidence of plausibly classical measurement error in Table 1. To examine the
potential effects of this error on our estimates, we generate a counterfactual

17

scenario where educational mobility follows an AR(1) process with classical
measurement error consistent with the reporting discrepancies found in Table 1
and that yields the mobility correlations we found in Table 4. We then compare
what we would observe under this counterfactual to our multigenerational
mobility results shown in Table 5.
Under classical measurement error, the observed regression coefficient is
attenuated by the magnitude of the variance of the measurement error (I) relative
to the variance of the true underlying independent variable (J ∗ ), or:
(4)

7=7

8
8LMNG /MPG∗

.

If we assume education for the same individual in two surveys are both
observed with error, the regression of one observation on the other is:
(5)

∗
J0%L8
+ I0%L8 = 7 J0%∗ + I0% + R0%L8 .

If S I0% , I0%L8 = 0, then 7 from this regression identifies TU: /TD:∗ because the
true 7 from a regression of a variable on itself is 1.16
The results of our measurement error counterfactual are shown in Table 6.17 We
show the observed three-generation regression coefficients compared to what we
would observe under the AR(1) measurement error counterfactual. In no cases are
the simulated estimates outside the 95 percent confidence intervals of the
16

Or approximately 1 in this case, as individuals could gain education as they age. We assume that this change is small,
as evidenced by the differences in reported education across observations for the same individuals shown in Table 1. The
assumption that S I0% , I0%L8 = 0 is a strong one. Alternatively, we could model misreporting as I0% = V0 + W0% where V0 is
the persistent misreporting of education of individual X and W0% is the transitory measurement error in survey year !. In this
∗
case, we would be estimating TY: /T :D ∗ LZ from a regression of J0%L8
+ V0 on J0%∗ + V0 + W0% . The possibility of persistent
education misreporting is an interesting research question that unfortunately cannot be answered in the absence of a
benchmark data source on educational attainment.
17
We assume the 1940-CPS measurement error estimates are also valid for the Grandparent generation as few individuals
in the Great-grandparent generation with children in 1910 or 1920 would be observed in the CPS in 1973 or later. In the
simulation shown, we assume the same measurement error in the Great-grandparent generation as we observe in the
Grandparent, as both have their education observed in the 1940 census. We will discuss additional assumptions at the end
of this section.

18

observed estimates. Therefore, the grandparent effect we observe in our
multigenerational

mobility

regressions

is

consistent

with

the

classical

measurement error we observe when comparing individual responses across
surveys. We interpret these results as very strong evidence that classical
measurement error is present in education. The grandparent effect we observe in
both three-generation samples either does not exist or is too small for us to
distinguish from measurement error.
However, we also test how long-term persistence would be understated under
an alternative mechanism. Assuming the grandparent effect is causal, we estimate
how the grandparent coefficient affects our understanding of intergenerational
mobility over the long term under an AR(2) model. We calculate the AR(1)
parameter that exhibits the same convergence over many generations as the AR(2)
parameters estimated in Table 5, Panel B. Over 10 generations18 with 78 = 0.416
and 7: = 0.060 from the Grandparent-Parent-Child three-generation sample, the
AR(1) parameter would have to be equal to 0.525 to have the same persistence.
The AR(1) equivalent estimate for the three-gen Great-Grandparent-GrandparentParent regression (78 = 0.436 and 7: = 0.031) is 0.495.
Therefore, in terms of the underestimate of long-term persistence, it does not
matter whether the observed grandparent effect is due to measurement error or
from a causal AR(2) model. In each case, the true long-term persistence is
underestimated by approximately 20 percent when estimated from two
generations of data. We also simulated the four-generation regression under an
AR(1) process. Again, we find no statistically significant difference between our
observed regression results in Table 5 and our measurement error estimates.

18

We chose 10 generations as a proxy for the very long term and given the long-term persistence suggested by Clark
(2014).

19

Selection into the Multigenerational Samples.—We also indirectly test for nonrandom selection into the regression samples by comparing the two-generation
regression coefficients from the three-generation samples to those estimated from
the two-generation samples in Ferrie, Massey, and Rothbaum (2016). The
assumption is that if selection into the matched regression sample is biasing our
results, that bias should be more severe when conditioning on selection into a
sample of three generations rather than two.
Figure 3 plots the average child years of schooling for each parent year of
schooling across each set of two generations in each of our two- and three-, and
four-generation samples. Panels A, B, and C compare the years of schooling
gradients between the Great-grandparent and Grandparent generations estimated
from three samples, in Panel A: the four-generation Great-grandparent to Child
sample, Panel B: the three-generation Great-grandparent to Parent sample, and
Panel C: the two-generation Great-grandparent to Grandparent sample. Panels D
and E compare the years of schooling gradients between the Grandparent and
Parent generations estimated from two samples, in Panel D: the four-generation
Great-grandparent to Child sample and Panel E: the three-generation Greatgrandparent to Parent sample. Panels F and G compare the years of schooling
gradients between the Parent and Child generations estimated from two samples,
in Panel F: the four-generation Great-grandparent to Child sample and Panel G:
the two-generation Parent to Child sample.19 We do not see evidence of selection
in the figure.
We formally test the different regression and correlation coefficients in Table 7.
Models (1) and (2) match Panels A-C above comparing mobility from the Great19

A three-generation Grandparent to Child sample is equivalent to the four-generation Great-grandparent to Child
sample as inclusion in the four-generation sample does not require a successful match to the Great-grandparent generation.
For the same reason, the three-generation Great-grandparent to Parent sample is equivalent to a two-generation
Grandparent to Parent sample.

20

grandparent to Grandparent generations, and neither the regression nor the
correlation coefficients are statistically significantly different from each other.
Models (3) and (4) make the comparison of Panels D and E above from the
Grandparent to Parent generations, again with no statistically significant
differences. Models (5) and (6) make the comparison of Panels F and G above
from the Parent to Child generations. In this case, the regression coefficients, but
not the correlation coefficients, are statistically different.
We interpret the difference in summary stats between our regression and full
samples in Tables 2-3 as evidence of some selection into our regression samples.
However, the bias seems relatively small when comparing the regression results
in Table 7, which should be differentially affected by selection into the two- vs.
three-generation samples.
V. Conclusion
As inequality in the US continues to increase, so does the importance of
pinpointing its roots. An important factor underlying inequality is its persistence
across generations. Much work by economists and sociologists examines the
persistence of social status across two generations from parent to child. We
extended this two-generational focus to include an analysis of educational
mobility across three and four generations of families in the US.
We examined multigenerational mobility in educational attainment by linking
families across multiple data sources. These sources include the 1910 Census, the
1920 Census, the 1940 Census, the CPS-ASEC spanning 1973-1990, the 2000
Census and the 2001-2013 ACS. From these linkages, we constructed two
grandparent-parent-child samples and one four-generation sample including greatgrandparents observed in the 1910 and 1920 censuses.
Our multigenerational analysis found a small, statistically significant
grandparent effect and no evidence of a great-grandparent effect. Even a small

21

independent grandparent-grandchild relationship can result in considerably slower
convergence to the mean over the long-term for individuals from advantaged or
disadvantaged educational backgrounds than is indicated by intergenerational
education regressions with only two generations. This finding was robust to
inclusion of multiple grandparents and both parents, as well as for matriarchal and
patriarchal lines followed and analyzed separately. However, measurement error
may spuriously cause positive coefficients on grandparent education.
Unlike other educational mobility research, we were able to evaluate
measurement error in reported educational attainment in each generation. We
found that many individuals do not consistently report education across surveys
and that inconsistent reporting was greatest for our earliest source of education
data, the 1940 Census. We further showed that misreported educational
attainment – in the magnitudes we found – could explain the positive grandparent
effect. This finding suggests that the literature’s focus on parent-child
transmission is valid when studying mobility of education in the US. However,
the same measurement error that spuriously caused a positive grandparent effect
also results in two-generation estimates that underestimate persistence by 20
percent. This underestimate is of a similar magnitude whether the grandparent
effect we find in our three generation is due to measurement error or is a true
causal effect.

Notes: Standard deviations shown in parentheses. Summary statistics are shown for the full survey sample and, where available, the sample of
those born in the US. The regression sample was constructed by conditioning on the match in the Grandparent and Parent generations, in effect
creating a two-generation sample. Afterwards, any available data on Great-grandparents was added, but the existence of the Great-grandparent
link was not required for inclusion in the data. The full sample includes all adults between the ages of 25 and 55 when observed in the survey.

Notes: Each regression reports the coefficient of years of schooling of the child regressed on years of schooling for the most educated parent
regressed. Errors are clustered at the parent family level. For the parent and child generations, each regression includes dummies for the year of
the survey. To be included in the regression, the child must be between 25 and 55 years old and the oldest parent must be between 25 and 55
years old. Each regression also includes age and age-squared terms for all generations to account the differences in ages for the observed parents
and children and any increases in education achieved as adults. Panel B shows the results for the same regressions in Panel A where each
education variable has been normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This allows us to account for the increase in the
variance of education over time.

Notes: Each regression reports the coefficient of years of schooling for the most educated observed ancestors (parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent, when relevant) regressed on the years of schooling of their child.
Errors are clustered at the parent family level. The great-grandparent generation sample is from the 1910 and 1920 Censuses linked to the 1940 Census with age data from 1910/1920 and education data from 1940. For the
parent and child generations, each regression includes dummies for the year of the survey. We also include dummies whether a match exists for each specific ancestor to account for the presence of more ancestors for
some individuals compared to others. To be included in the regression, the child must be between 25 and 55 years old and the oldest parent and grandparent must be between 25 and 55 years old. Each regression also
includes age and age-squared terms for all generations to account the differences in ages for the observed parents and children and any increases in education achieved as adults. Because the match rate is lowest in the
1910/1920 Census, we include all parents and grandparents from our two-generation sample and add any information on the great-grandparents with dummies for the presence of each of the four possible individuals. Panel
B shows the results for the same regressions in Panel A where each education variable has been normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This allows us to account for the increase in the variance of
education over time.

Notes: This table reports the result of a counterfactual estimate of intergenerational and multigenerational mobility under measurement error. We assume
that intergenerational mobility follows an AR(1) process. We also assume our two-generation estimates from Table 4 (shown in Panel A as Observed in
each regression) are attenuated according to our measurement error estimates in Table 1 to get the “True” coefficient estimates in Panel A. The
counterfactual three- and four-generation regressions are simulated under the AR(1) process with measurement error. In Panel B, we report the results
observed in our three-generation regressions from Table as Observed and the results from our measurement error counterfactual simulation as Simulated. In
Panel C, we do the same for our four-generation regression results from Table 5. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. The counterfactual standard
errors are calculated using a bootstrap by sampling from the measurement error and intergenerational education mobility coefficient distributions using the
standard errors reported in Table 1 and Table 4. None of the simulated values in Panels B and C lie outside of the 95 percent confidence intervals of the
observed values.

Notes: In this table, we compare the two-generation regression coefficients for our three-generation samples compared to the larger two-generation samples.
Each regression reports the coefficient of years of schooling for the most educated parent regressed on the years of schooling of their child. Errors are
clustered at the parent family level. For the parent and child generations, each regression includes dummies for the year of the survey. To be included in the
regression, the child must be between 25 and 55 years old and the oldest parent must be between 25 and 55 years old. Each regression also includes age and
age-squared terms for all generations to account the differences in ages for the observed parents and children and any increases in education achieved as
adults. Panel B shows the results for the same regressions in Panel A where each education variable has been normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard
deviation of 1. This allows us to account for the increase in the variance of education over time.

FIGURE 3. INTERGENERATIONAL EDUCATION GRADIENTS BY 2-, 3-, AND 4-GENERATION SAMPLES
Notes: This figure shows the intergenerational education gradient across each set of generations for each sample (2-, 3-, and 4-generations) used in the paper. The 4-generation sample in Panels A, D,
and F include all families with matched individuals in the grandparent generation from the 1940 Census, parent generation from the 1973-1990 CPS ASECs, and child generation from the 2000 Long
Form Census and 2001-2013 ACSs. The great-grandparents from the 1910 and 1920 Census are added to the data set when available, but are not required for inclusion of the other three generations in
the sample. The 3-generation sample in Panels B and E includes matched parents in the grandparent generation from the 1940 Census and children in the parent generation from the 1973-1990 CPS
ASECs. The great-grandparents from the 1910/1920 Census are added to the data set when available, but are not required for inclusion of the other two generations in the sample. The 2-generation
sample in Panel C includes matched parents in the great-grandparent generation from the 1910/1920 Census and their children in the grandparent generation from the 1940 Census. The 2-generation
sample in Panel G includes matched parents from the 1973-1990 CPS ASECs and children from the 2000 Long Form Census and 2001-2013 ACSs. For each pair of parent-child generations, the dots
show the average child education at each parent education level (with at least 25 parent observations). The fitted lines show the observation-weighted regression coefficient of the average child
education regressed on the parent education levels shown.

For Online Publication: Appendix
Record Linkage Techniques.–The Center for Administrative Records and Research (CARRA)
uses the Person Identification Validation System (PVS) to assign unique protected identification
keys (PIKs) to person records in census and survey data to facilitate record linkage (Wagner and
Layne 2014). PIKs correspond one-to-one with a particular person and, once assigned, allow
researchers to link individuals across files that have been “PIKed.” To assign the PIKs, the PVS
uses a probabilistic matching algorithm to compare personally identifiable information (PII) –
such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs), full name, full date of birth, and address – of census
and survey records to person records in a reference file. The PVS assigns the PIK to a census or
survey observation whose characteristics sufficiently match the characteristics of the reference
record associated with that PIK.
The reference file consists of Social Security Administration (SSA) Numident data as well as
other federal-agency administrative data. Each SSN in the reference file corresponds uniquely
with a PIK. The reference file includes nearly 500 million SSNs and is formatted to include
additional records for each name and date of birth change made for a particular SSN through the
SSA.20 Consequently, the reference file is large and accounts for name changes associated with
marriage as well as nicknames. The reference file is enhanced using other federal administrative
data to obtain additional variables not in the Numident, such as place of residence.
The PVS follows the typical steps in record linkage: preprocessing, sorting into blocks,
identifying potential matches, and resolving multiple matches. Person records are preprocessed
to standardize the blocking and matching fields to ensure comparability across the census file
and the reference file. Next, because the reference file is large, PVS sorts the input and reference
files into blocks to create reasonably sized search spaces (Michelson and Knoblock, 2006). The
PVS creates the Cartesian product of the census and reference records falling within the same
block, comparing every census record to every reference record falling within the same block.
The PVS then scores the similarity between the census and reference records in this comparison
space.

20

The average number of transactions per SSN is 2.1 (Harris, 2014).

38

The PVS assigns potential matches a total score depending on the similarity of the
characteristics of the input records and reference file records. PVS employs a string comparator
program to measure Jaro-Winkler distances between first and last names (Winkler, 1995).21
These distances serve as a metric of how closely two names match, while allowing for some
degree of misspelling. For numeric variables, such as year of birth, a maximum acceptable
difference between the variable value in the input and reference record is dictated by the
researchers, but is typically no more than 2 years. This also allows for creation of an interval, or
band, around year of birth to permit inexact matches. The total score is calculated as the sum of
the agreement and disagreement weights attributed to each matching variable (Felligi and Sunter,
1969).
The PVS identifies potential matches within each blocking strategy, or module, retaining only
those with an overall score greater than a user-specified cutoff score as potential matches. Input
records that do not receive a match in one module move to the next specified module. Once the
input data has been processed through all passes of a module, with each pass having more
refined blocking schemes,22 potential matches are grouped into one file and sorted by person and
by score.
The final step of a module evaluates the potential matches. The matches with the highest
scores are processed using a decision rule to determine if the PVS will assign the PIK. If one
potential match has a higher score than all the other potential matches for a particular input
record, then the PIK associated with that reference record is assigned to that input observation. If
there are multiple potential matches for a particular input observation with the same high score,
then no PIK is assigned in that module. Records that fail to find a match in a module are passed
along to the next module.
The PVS includes several modules that employ various blocking schemes. These include the
Verification module, which blocks on SSN, the Geosearch module, which blocks by the first
three digits of a zip code, the Namesearch module, which blocks on the first letter of first and last
name, the Date of Birth module, which blocks on month and day of birth, the ZIP3 Adjacency
21

The PVS string comparator was developed by Winkler (1995) and measures the distance between two strings on a scale from 0 to 900, where
a distance score of 0 is given if there is no similarity between two text strings and a score of 900 is given for an exact match. The cutoff value for
the string distance is set to 750.
22
The first pass, for example, might be the most restrictive and require name and date of birth match exactly. The next pass may only require the
first few letters of the first and last name match.

39

module, which creates clusters of zip-3 areas that border each other, and the Household
Composition module, which uses family structure information to assign PIKs to household
members in households where at least one person was assigned a PIK in one of the other
modules. The choice of module depends on the information available in each dataset. For
instance, only datasets with SSNs are processed by the Verification module.
The Census Applications Branch (CAB) within CARRA processed the 2000 Census and the
2001-2013 American Community Surveys (ACS) through the PVS. CAB assigned PIKs to these
files using full name (first, last, and middle), full date of birth (month, day, and year), and street
address. To assign PIKs to the 1940 Census and the 1973-1990 Current Population Surveys
(CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC), we modified the PVS to assign PIKs
tailored to the information available on each file.
The 1940 Census contains PII that is not traditionally used to assign PIKs. We adapted the
Census Bureau’s matching software to use state or country of birth, location in 1940 and 1935,
and parents’ names in addition to more traditional PII such as first name, middle initial, last
name, and age. To incorporate place of birth, we coded birthplace in the Numident to match the
five-digit IPUMS birthplace (BPL) codes in the 1940 Census, accounting for both territories and
changes in country names over time. To match on age, we calculated age on April 1, 1940 using
full date of birth in the reference file and compared this to reported age in the 1940 Census.
We used six customized modules to PIK the 1940 Census. The first module blocked on the
first three digits of the IPUMS BPL code. The second module blocked on age on April 1, 1940.
The third module blocked on the first letter of first and last name. The fourth and fifth modules
compared location in 1940 and 1935 observed from the 1940 Census to states where records
received their SSN in the reference file. For these modules, we used the first three digits of the
SSN (called the area number) to determine location of SSN issue in the reference file and
allowed no more than 2 years difference between age in 1940 or 1935 and the age a person
acquired their SSN. The final module blocks on county observed in 1940 and 1935 to state and
county of birth observed in the reference file. We only processed person-records less than 2 years
old in 1940 or 1935 through this module to ensure we did not introduce significant bias from
migration. Within each module, potential matches were scored based on the similarity of first
name, middle initial, last name, age, five-digit state or country of birth BPL code, and parents’
first name.
40

We used probabilistic matching techniques to link the 1940 Census back to the 1910 and 1920
censuses to obtain education for the Great-Grandparent generation. We used the 1920 Census in
addition to the 1910 Census to reduce bias introduced by requiring survival of the GreatGrandparent generation to 1940. To link 1910 and 1920 to 1940, we used first name, middle
initial (if available), last name, age, sex, and state or country of birth. We employed two blocking
strategies, first blocking on place of birth then blocking on the first letter of the first and last
name. We allowed a tolerance of three years in age between a 1910 or 1920 observation and a
potential match in the 1940 Census. Once the probabilistic matching algorithm identified and
scored all potential matches, we used only the highest-scoring, unique match.
When the initial match between 1910/1920 and 1940 was complete, we appended education
data from the 1940 census to adults in the 1910 and 1920 censuses. We then used the
relationship-to-household-head variable to construct family units and identify children. These
children were linked forward to the 1940 Census. To account for name-changes of women, we
appended mother’s maiden names from the Numident to children in the 1940 Census using the
PIKs discussed previously. Once we knew a child’s mother’s maiden name, we appended the
maiden names to mothers observed in 1940 to link backwards to 1910 and 1920.
To fill in the gap between 1940 and 2000, we produced PIKed versions of the 1973, 1979, and
the 1981-1990 CPS. We employed multiple techniques to PIK this data. For 1973, 1979, and
1981-1985 data, we used probabilistic matching techniques to assign PIKs using SSN, first
name, middle initial, last name, age (or full date of birth if available), and sex. We observed
SSN for a large number of observations over the age of 15. For children, we also used parents’
first names in the PIKing algorithm. We used two blocking procedures: one blocking on age and
one blocking on first and last name initials.
The 1986-1990 CPS did not contain first or last name. To PIK this data, we merged the CPS to
the Numident using SSN. If sex and age agreed, we assigned the PIK associated with that SSN.
We were able to PIK 99.5 percent of the 248,670 respondents who provided a SSN (out of
386,630 total respondents). Because we do not observe SSN for children under the age of 15, we
took additional steps to increase the number of parent-child associations possible from the CPS.
After PIKing adults who provided an SSN, we used the PIKs to append first and last name from
the Numident to the 1986-1990 CPS. We then took these appended these names to observations
of their children, allowing us to PIK children using age, sex, and parents’ first and last names.

Notes: Each regression reports the coefficient of years of schooling of the child regressed on the years of schooling for the most educated observed ancestors (parent and grandparent and great-grandparent, when relevant).
Errors are clustered at the parent family level. The great-grandparent generation sample is from the 1910 and 1920 Censuses linked to the 1940 Census with age data from 1910/1920 and education data from 1940. For the
parent and child generations, each regression includes dummies for the year of the survey. We also include dummies whether a match exists for each specific ancestor to account for the presence of more ancestors for
some individuals compared to others. To be included in the regression, the child must be between 25 and 55 years old and the oldest parent and grandparent must be between 25 and 55 years old. Each regression also
includes age and age-squared terms for all generations to account the differences in ages for the observed parents and children and any increases in education achieved as adults. Because the match rate is lowest in the
1910/1920 Census, we include all parents and grandparents from our two-generation sample and add any information on the great-grandparents with dummies for the presence of each of the four possible individuals. Panel
B shows the results for the same regressions in Panel A where each education variable has been normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is allows us to account for the increase in the variance of
education over time. This differs from Table 5 in that all regressions that include the Great-Grandparent generation include only those in the subsequent generation with an observed ancestor in the Great-Grandparent
generation.

Notes: In this table, we compare the two-generation regression coefficients for our three-generation samples compared to the larger two-generation samples. Each regression reports the coefficient of years of
schooling for years of schooling of the child on the years of schooling of the most educated parent regressed. Errors are clustered at the parent family level. For the parent and child generations, each regression
includes dummies for the year of the survey. To be included in the regression, the child must be between 25 and 55 years old and the oldest parent must be between 25 and 55 years old. Each regression also
includes age and age-squared terms for all generations to account the differences in ages for the observed parents and children and any increases in education achieved as adults. Panel B shows the results for the
same regressions in Panel A where each education variable has been normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is allows us to account for the increase in the variance of education over
time. This differs from Table 7 in that all regressions that include the Great-Grandparent generation include only those in the subsequent generation with an observed ancestor in the Great-Grandparent generation.

Notes: Each regression reports the coefficient of years of schooling for the most educated observed ancestors (parent and grandparent) regressed on the years of schooling of their child. Column (1) includes the full sample of
children regressed on the most educated ancestor in each generation. Columns (2) and (3) include sons and daughters respectively regressed against the most educated ancestors in each generation. Column (4) shows a
regression of sons’ years of schooling on the years of schooling of their fathers and paternal grandfathers. Column (5) shows a regression of daughters’ years of schooling on the years of schooling of their mothers and
maternal grandmothers. Column (6) uses mean ancestor education in each generation instead of maximum in the regression. Column (7) reports the coefficients on the most educated ancestor when all individual ancestor
years of schooling is also included. Column (8) includes both mean and max education in each ancestor generation, with the coefficient on the most educated ancestor reported. In column (8), The corresponding coefficients
in B. for mean education are 0.15*** for parents and -0.80 for grandparents. Errors are clustered at the parent family level. For the parent and child generations, each regression includes dummies for the year of the survey.
We also include dummies whether a match exists for each specific ancestor to account for the presence of more ancestors for some individuals compared to others. To be included in the regression, the child must be between
25 and 55 years old and the oldest parent and grandparent must be between 25 and 55 years old. Each regression also includes age and age-squared terms for all generations to account the differences in ages for the observed
parents and children and any increases in education achieved as adults. Panel B shows the results for the same regressions in Panel A where each education variable has been normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard
deviation of 1. This allows us to account for the increase in the variance of education over time.
