Are User Fees Regressive?
The Welfare Implications of Health Care Financing Proposals in Peru

ABSTRACT

In this paper, we derive a discrete choice model of the demand for

medical care from a theoretical model that implies a natural interrelation
between price and income.

We show that, in the context of a discrete choice

model, if health is a normal good, then the price elasticity of the demand for

health care must decline as income rises. This implies that the models in
previous discrete choice studies which restrict the price effect to be
independent of income are misspecified.

The model is estimated using data from a 1984 Peruvian survey, and a

parsimonious flexible functional form. Unlike previous studies, we find that
price plays a significant role in the demand for health care, and that demand
becomes more elastic as income falls, implying that user fees would reduce the

access to care for the poor proportionally more than for the rich. Our
simulations show that user fees can generate substantial revenues, but are
accompanied by substantial reductions in aggregate consumer welfare, with the

burden of the loss on the poor. These results demonstrate that
undiscriminating user fees would be regressive both in terms of access and
welfare.

L INTRODUCTION
Many developing countries have created extensive publicly supported

health care systems, access to which Is at little or no cost.1 The financial
crisis of the 1980's has forced many of them to consider instituting user fees

(i.e, charge individuals for access). Those in favor of user fees argue that
they facilitate recovery of the cost of providing the service, and, if they
are set at marginal cost, improve allocative efficiency.2 The strongest

argument against user fees is that they may be regressive in that they may not
allow all income groups equal access to medical care because the poor may be

more price sensitive than the rich. Even if everyone is equally price
sensitive, user fess will be regressive if the welfare loss for the poor
relative to income is larger than for the rich.

In the absence of user fees, equal access is still not assured. It has
been well known since Acton (1975) that nonmonetary access costs such as

travel time are important determinants of health care choices. The
geographical distribution of services may make access more difficult for some

groups. For example, locating facilities closer to the upper and middle
classes discriminates against the poor. User fee proponents argue that
revenues can be reinvested to reduce nonmonetary access costs, and
consequently minimize consumers' welfare loss.
Since user fee proposals are so widespread and the potential welfare
effects so large, it is important that some ex ante analysis be performed.

This paper provides a methodology for such an ex ante analysis, and to our
knowledge, the first estimates of expected revenues and welfare losses
(measured as compensating variations) associated with one such proposal.

The analysis requires estimation of the demand for health care, from

2

which the revenues and welfare changes of proposed user fees can be simulated.
The magnitude of the revenue and welfare effects depend crucially on the price

elasticity of demand. Previous studies in developing countries have found
little if any Impact of price on demand. These studies model the demand for
health care as a discrete choice between alternative providers, with the price

effect specified to be Independent of income.3 This assumption Is extreme'y
restrictive, since one would expect the wealthy to be less sensitive to price

differences across providers than the poor. Indeed, we show that this
specification is inconsistent with stable utility maximization, and that, If
health Is a normal good, the demand for health care must become more price
elastic as Income falls.

The discrete choice specification in this paper is derived from a
theoretical model that implies a natural interaction between price and Income
in the demand functions, and those demand functions are estimated using a
parsimonious flexible functional form that allows the data to determine the

effect of income on price elasticities. The resulting model facilitates the
study of the distributional Impacts of user fees.

The empirical investigation considers the potential effects of user fees

In urban Peru. The estimates show that price plays an Important role in
health care demand. Further, demand becomes more elastic as income falls
Indicating, as expected, that health is Indeed a normal good. This implies
that the Introduction of health care user fees in Peru would reduce access
proportionally more for the poor than the rich, and, In this sense, be

regressive. Our simulations demonstrate that while user fees would generate
substantial revenues, they would also generate substantial reductions in

aggregate consumer welfare with the burden of the loss on the poor. The
simulations also indicate that the welfare loss from the current spatial

3

distribution of public health care services is roughly equal to the expected
welfare loss from moderate user fees, and that the loss Is fairly evenly

distributed across income groups. Therefore, if the government imposed
moderate user fees and used the revenues to solve the rationing problem, there
would be little if any aggregate welfare loss, but there would be a
redistribution of welfare from poor to rich.

II. BEHAVIORAL ASSUMPTIONS

The framework for this discussion is a static model in which utility

depends on health and consumption of goods other than medical care. When an
illness or accident is experienced, individuals must decide whether to seek

medical care. The benefit from consuming medical care Is an improvement in
health, and the cost of medical care is a reduction in the consumption of
other goods. Individuals not only have to decide whether to seek care, but

also what type of care. They are faced with a set of alternative providers,
each of which has a different potential impact (efficacy) on their health.

This efficacy depends on providers' skills, individuals' characteristics (e.g.
medical problems, general health status, and ability to implement the
recommended treatment plan), and a random term that captures the notion that

the efficacy of medical care is not deterministic. An Individual's
expectation of this impact can be viewed as the perceived quality of care.

In essence, individuals are faced with a discrete choice decision. A
choice must be made between the various provider alternatives, including self—
care. Each alternative offers a set package (quality) for a given price, where
the price includes both monetary outlays and nonmonetary access costs such as

travel and waiting time. Based on this information, their health statuses,
types of medical problems, and incomes, individuals choose the alternatives

4

that yield the greatest utilities.

We consider the short run utility maximization problem faced by an

individual who has recently experienced an accident or illness. Let the
utility, conditional on receiving care from provider 3, be given by

(1)

U3 = U(H31C3,T3),

where H3 is expected health status after receiving treatment from provider 3,
C3 is expenditures on consumption after paying provider 3, and T3 is the
nonmonetary cost of access to provider 3.

The health care purchased from provider 3 is invested in health. The
perceived quality (marginal product) of provider 3's medical care is the

expected improvement in health. Let H0 be expected health status without
professional medical care (i.e. self—treatment); then, the perceived quality

of provider 3's care is 0 =

H3/H0,

which yields an expected health care

production function of the form

H3 =

O

H0,

(2)

where H3 is proportional to H0. The quality parameter depends upon provider
characteristics (e.g. training and facilities) and individual characteristics
(e.g. type and severity of illness).

This production function takes on a rather simple form for the self—care

alternative. Since H3 equals H0, the proportionality factor is unity for the
self—care alternative. In effect, this normalizes the health care production
function so that the quality of a particular provider's care is measured
relative to efficacy of self—care.

5

The level of consumption expenditure conditional on choosing provider j,

C, is derived from the budget constraint. Let Pj be provider j's price arid Y
be income, then

Cj = Y —

with Cj

Pj

(3)

0 required for feasibility.4 Substitution of (3) into (1) yields

=

— PjTj).

Income affects utility through the consumption term, and is assumed to be
exoegnous .
Now we are ready to specify the utility maximization problem. Suppose the

individual has J+1 feasible alternatives (with the j=0 alternative being self—

care). The unconditional utility maximization problem is

=

max(U0,U1,...,U3),

(4)

where U is the highest utility the individual can attain,
If health is a normal good, then the demand for health Increases with

income. A necessary condition for normality Is that as income rises, the
marginal rate of substitution of consumption for health diminishes, holding

health constant. This point is demonstrated in figure 1, where the continuous
choice case with health being a normal good is pictured. As income rises the
point of utility maximization moves out from the origin along the expansion
path. Holding health constant at Fl, we move to the right along the horizontal
line as income rises, intersecting the indifference curves at points of

6

flatter slopes, Implying a diminishing marginal rate of substitution.
In a discrete choice world, normality Implies that as Income rises
individuals are more likely to choose the "higher price/higher quality"

options. Here as well, a necessary condition for normality is that as income
rises, the marginal rate of substitution of consumption for health diminishes,

holding health constant. This is demonstrated in figure 2, where the discrete
choice case with health as a normal good is pictured. In figure 2, there Is a

choice between a "high price/high qualityu option h'0h' and a "low
price/low quality" option (P2,02). At a low income level, say Y2, the choice
is between points A and B; I.e. between a gain in health of (Hh — H2) and a
gain in consumption of

—

At income Y2, the additional consumption is

preferred to the additional health and the wiow price/low quality" option B is

chosen. The high Income individual with income h has a choice between points
C and D. These points represent the same tradeoff between health and
consumption as points A and B. As income rises the marginal rate of
substitution of consumption for health falls along both horizontal lines Hh

and H2. Eventually, at some income between

and h' the gain in health is

preferred to the gain in consumption. At income h' the uhigh price/high
qualityTM option C is chosen.

In a discrete choice world, if health Is a normal good, a rise In Income
increases the likelihood that individuals purchase TMhigher price/higher

quality" alternatives. Another way of looking at this is that an Increase in
price is less likely to dissuade richer Individuals from choosing the TMhigher

price/higher quality" alternatives. In a probabilistic sense, normality
Implies that richer Individuals are less price elastic than poorer
Individuals.

7

III. EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION
The solution to (4) yields a system of demand functions, whose forms are
probabilities that the alternatives are chosen given that an individual

experiences an accident or illness. The demand function for a given
alternative is found by calculating the probability that this particular

alternative yields the highest utility amongst all the alternatives. The
functional form of the demand functions depends on the functional form of the
utility function conditional upon choosing a particular provider and the
distribution of the stochastic variables.

A.. The Conditional Utility Function

It is customary to begin by considering a linear functional form for the

conditional utility function in (1). Substitution of (3) into a linear
utility function yields

Uj =

where

aiHj

+

a2(Y

—

Pj)

+

a3Tj

+

(5)

is a random taste shock that is uncorrelated across alternatives.

Notice that a2Y enters each alternative's utility function, implying that the

influence of income on utility does not vary by alternative. Since only
differences in utility matter, a linear utility function imposes the
restriction that income has no effect on the choice of provider and that the

marginal rate of substitution is constant. Therefore, this specification is
inconsistent with health being a normal good.

A common method of trying to relax this restriction is to allow the

coefficient on consumption to vary by alternative.6 That specification
violates the maximization of a stable utility function. It asserts that,

8

holding income, prices, and health constant, the marginal rate of substitution
varies by alternative.

A parsimonious parameterization that does not place second order
restrictions on the marginal rate of substitution, does not violate the
maximization of a stable utility function, and is linear in parameters, is the
semi—translog, where health and access costs enter in log form and consumption

enters in both log and log squared form.7 Substitution of (2) and (3) into a
semi—translog conditional utility function yields

=

—

lnH0 + lnOj + a1ln(Y

Pj)

+

u2ln(Y

—

Pj)lfl(Y

—

Pj)

+

a3lnTj

+

(6)

The quadratic term is necessary so that the specification does not impose

normality and a diminishing marginal rate of substitution, but rather allows
us to test for them.

B. Quality

In equation (6) neither lnH0 nor lnQj are observed. Since lnH0 appears
in the utility function for all the choices and its value does not vary by
alternative, it does not influence which alternative is preferred, and
therefore can be ignored.

A more difficult issue arises because of the unobservability of lflOj. To
solve this problem we specify a quality (marginal product) function for each

provider type. Specifically, let the expected quality from provider j be

lnQ =

Oj

+

+

+

(7)

where X is a vector of the individual's characteristics (i.e. measures of

9
health status, severity of illness and education), Z is a vector of

characteristics of provider j, and

is a random shock, The error term

represents unobserved individual characteristics, such severity and complexity
of Illness, that may affect the providers' marginal productivitles relative to

self—care. Recall that quality is normalized relative to the self—care
alternative, implying that lnO0 =

0.

The crror term tj may be correlated

across the non—self—care alternatives.
The reduced form conditional utility function for alternative ,j is found

by substituting (7) into (6). SpecifIcally, for alternatives j=i,...,j,

Uj =V +

E,j +tj

(8)

where

Vj =

$2jZJ

+

a1ln(Y

Pj)

+

u2ln(Y

—

Pj)ln(Y

—

+

a3lnT3.

Note that the intercept and coefficients on the quality terms vary by
alternative as do the values of consumption and access costs (but not their

coefficients). Since lnQ0 = 0, T0 =

0,

and P0 =

0, the reduced form

conditional utility function for the self—care alternative becomes

LI0 =

a1lnY

Note further that

does not exist as quality is normalized relative to the

self-care alternative.

10

C. The Budget Constraint
Specification of the budget constraint requires determining the relevant

budgeting period. Since the health care decision is discrete and made

Irregularly, consumers may be wining to borrow against future income. If
capital markets are perfect and individuals (or families) can borrow without

restriction, the relevant income constraint is the present value of income, or

wealth. The other extreme assumption is that no resources outside each income
period can be used. The actual period may be somewhere in between.
We let the data determine the appropriate budgeting period. Define y as
permanent monthly income and r as the period discount rate, then the

constraining income in (4) is ky, where the parameter k is a function of the
length of the budgeting period and r.

If budgeting is restricted to one

If the budgeting period is infinity (i.e. there

period, then k is equal to 1.

Is perfect borrowing and lending), then k is equal to hr.

The addition of k implies (8) is no longer linear in parameters. We
linearize (8) using an approximation to the log of consumption. The log of
consumption can be expressed as

ln(ky —

Pj)

=

ln(ky)

+

ln(1

—

Pj/ky).

(9)

Since Pj/ky the budget share of alternative j, is expected to be small, the
second term in (9) can be approximated by _Pj/ky, which allows us to rewrite

the log consumption and log consumption squared terms in (8) as

a1ln(ky) +a2ln(ky)ln(ky) —

(a2/k2)(Pj/Y)2

—

(a1

+2a2lnk)/k)(Pj/y) +

(2a2/k)(P/y)lny.

(10)

11

Notice that the first two terms in (10) are the same across all alternatives,

Including self—care. Since only differences in utility across alternatives
matter, these terms have no effect on provider choice, and therefore, can be

left out. Further, when k equals one, (10) reduces to

—

+

a1(Pj/y)

a2(Pj/y)(P/y

—

2lny).

(11)

Since both (10) and (11) are linear in parameters, they provide us with an

easy likelihood ratio test for k equal to one.

D. The Demand Functions and Welfare
The demand function for an alternative is the probability that Its

utility is greater than from any other alternatives. McFadden (1981) shows
that, given reasonable distributional assumptions on

and T, these demands

take on a nested multinomial logit (NMNL) form, where it is first decided
whether to seek care, and then conditional on seeking care decide from which

provider to seek care. The probability that provider j is chosen is

—

exp[crln(31 exp(Vj))]

exp(V0)

+

exp[cln(...1

exp(Vj))] (13=i

and the probability of self—care is

exp(V0)

IT=
exp(V0) +

exp[oln(3...1

exPVj

exp(Vj))]

exp(Vj))

12

where the Vi's are given by (8) wIth (10) substItuted for the log consumption

terms. Also the a1ln(ky) and aln(ky)ln(ky) are excluded as they do not vary
by alternative, which inplies that V0 = 0.

The parameter c is one minus the

correlation of the j=1,...,J utilities introduced by the r,11s.

McFadden also shows that NMNL reduces to a multinomlal logit (MNL) when o
is unity. The P4MNL is more general than MNL in that it allows corre'ation
between the utilities that share common attributes, and therefore does not
suffer from the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption.

The estimated demand functions can be used to project the impact of user
fees on demand (and revenues), and the number of people who do not seek health

care as a result of user fees. These demand functions also form the basis of
our computation of the welfare costs of user fess, where the welfare costs are

measured by compensating variations.8 For example, consider changing the
vector of provider prices from P1 to P2. Following Small and Rosen (1981), in
the case of a nested multinomial logit, the amount of income the individual
must be given to make him as well off at P2 as at P' is

=

(1/X){ln[exp(V)

where Vj and

+

exp(V))°}

—

ln{exp(V)

+

exp(V))fl

(12) -

are evaluated at P1 and P2, respectively, and X is the

marginal utility of income.9 The compensating variation for nonprice changes
(such as travel time) can be similarly calculated.

IV. DATA AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIROJIIENT

The empirical work utilizes data from a 1984 Peruvian household survey,

the Encuesta Nacional de Nutricion y Salud (ENNSA). The survey contains a rich
set of socio—economic data, as well as morbidity and health care utilization

13

information for a two week recall. Since this

study analyzes contingent

health care demand, we restricted our sample to those persons who reported

having symptoms or an accident. The sample was taken from individuals
in the urban Sierra and Lirna

regions.

living

Rural regions were excluded because

reliable income data do not exist for them. A sample of 3412 individuals age
16 and above is the basis for this work.

Descriptive statistics are presented

in table 1.

Peru has a mix of public and private health care. The major provider of
public health care is the Ministry of Health, which operates

hospitals and

clinics. The next largest provider of public health care Is the Instituto
Peruano de Seguridad Social (Social Security). It operates hospitals for Its
members, which are not available to non—members. In the analysis, Social
Security hospitals are not viewed as a separate alternative, but rather are

included in the public hospital alternative. A dummy variable indicating
whether the individual was a Social Security member is included In the

hospital equation to account for quality differences. The dominant private
health care providers are physicians. Other types of private providers, such
as traditional healers, and pharmacists were not numerically important, and

were merged with the no consultation group to form our se1f_careu
alternative. The four alternatives are: (1) self—care, (2)public hospital,
(3) public clinic, and (4) private doctor.

The arguments of the quality (marginal product) function are the initial
state of health, the type of illness, human capital, and provider

characteristics. Measures of health status prior to treatment are age and
type of illness, which is measured by a set of dummy variables Indicating
whether the individual's medical problem was an accident or acute Illness,

digestive illness, respiratory illness, or other illness. The other illness

14

dummy variable was excluded. The quality of providers is thought to vary by
location.

Hence, a set of regional dummy variables indicating if the

individual lives in central Lima, the north and south cones of Lima, and the

north, south, and central regions of the Sierra are included. The central
Sierra dummy variable was excluded. In addition, the individual's education
was included as a measure of human capital.
Income was measured as total family income in the month prior to the

survey. Family income is the relevant concept here because family members are
not provided or denied health care on the basis of their labor force statuses.
This measure reduces the sensitivity of income to the illness of any
particular family member.

Since income does not vary by alternative, we need variation in prices
across alternatives to Identify end estimate the coefficients on the log

consumption and log consumption squared terms. In a discrete choice
framework, identification requires variation across alternatives. Although
variation across individuals is not necessary, it is desirable as it improves

the estimation precision. In our data the public hospital and clinic prices
do not vary by individual, but there is substantial cross—individual variation
in private doctor prices as the data covers many different regions, were
collected over a nine month period in which relative prices changed
substantially.

Measuring prices posed a difficult problem. The model requires prices
for each alternative, but these were not directly available. The ENNSA only
collected price information for the provider from which the Individual

received care. For those who sought care, price data were only available for
the alternative they chose, and for individuals who did not seek care there is
no information.

15

The measurement problem was easily solved for hospitals and clinics,
since they charged a user fee of 1,000 to 2,000 soles.

In our sample, about

35Z of hospital and clinic users reported paying nothing, about 50 reported

paying 1,000 soles, and almost all the rest reported 2,000 soles. About half
of the reported zero fees are from Social Security hospitals, which do not

charge their members for services. The other half are probably a result of
failure to collect the fees. Since these prices are minuscule relative to
monthly family income (see table 1), we assumed individuals expected to pay
1,000 soles at Ministry of Health hospitals and clinics.
For private doctor prices, we used the available information to estimate
hedonic price equations, and then imputed prices for all individuals.

The

equation specified price to be a function of age, illness, and market
structure variables such as population and availability of health care

services. Income was not used In order to avoid attributing higher prices to
higher income individuals who may have purchased higher quality care. An
additional problem was selectivity bias. The observed distribution of prices
paid will not be representative of the ex ante distribution of prices because

individuals are more likely to chose low price alternatives. We corrected for
this selectivity bias by following an instrumental variables procedure used in
Dubin and McFadden (1984).10
Finally, we measure nonmonetary access cost by travel time to the

provider. The travel time data suffer from the same problems as the price

data. In addition, travel time information was collected in discrete
categories. Binary logit hedonic travel time equations (with selectivity bias
correction) were used to estimate the probability of travelling more than an
hour.

16

V. RESULTS
The parameters of a MNL and a NMNL were estimated by maximum likelihood.

The NMNL nested the choice of provider within the choice of whether to seek

care at all. The hypothesis that the NMNL is not different from the MNL was
accepted at the .05 level, and the hypothesis that k equals unity was also

accepted at the 0.05 level.11 The estimated coefficients and associated t—
statistics for the MNL with k equal to one are presented In table 2.
-

The coefficients on log consumption and log consumption squared are

significant at the .1 and .01 levels, respectively. Price and income therefore

play important roles in the demand for medical care. Since price and income
enter in a highly nonlinear form it is difficult to assess their influence on

demand just from looking at the coefficient values. For this reason, arc
price elasticities for clinic, hospital and private doctor services were

computed by sample income quintile and are presented in table 3. The price
elasticities are negative over all prices and income groups, and demand is

more elastic at lower incomes and at higher prices. The magnitude of the
prices elasticities varies greatly by income. In the highest Income quintile,
demand appears to be completely inelastic, while demand in the lowest income
quintile is much more sensitive to price.

We have assumed that income is exogenous. If, In fact, income is
endogenous, there is a possibility of simultaneity bias. The bias is likely
to have a downward Impact on the estimated price and income effects, making

them closer to zero. The effect we are Interested in measuring Is the causal
impact of changes in Income on health care demand. If health is a normal

good, then that effect is positive. The simultaneity bias arises because an
accident or illness may reduce income. The more severe and complex the
illness or accident the greater the reduction in Income. However, the more

17

severely ill have greater medical need and are therefore more likely to seek

medical care. This implies that the observed relation between income and
demand will likely be biased towards zero. Since price enters our model as a
reduction in consumption (V —

P),

Its effect Is also likely to be biased

towards zero. Therefore, our estimated price elasticities should be lower
bounds on the true elasticities.

The coefficient on the probability of traveling more than an hour is
negative and estimated with precision. This implies that increases in
nonmonetary access costs reduce demand.

The estimated quality parameters are consistent with our expectations.
The coefficients on age are positive and significant in the hospital and

private doctor equations, and negative in the clinic equation. Hence, older
Individuals perceive private doctor and hospital care to be of higher quality
than self—care and clinic care, and self—care to be of higher quality than

clinic care. The coefficients on education are positive and significant in
the private doctor and hospital equations, and negative and significant in the

clinic equation. The coefficient estimates imply that education increases the
expected productivity of private doctor care and hospital care relative to
self—care, and reduces the expected productivity of clinic care relative to
sd f—care.

The coefficients on the acute illness (emergencies) imply that hospitals
and clinics have a comparative advantage in treating these problems over

private doctor or self—care. Individuals with respiratory illnesses believe
that they they have a comparative advantage in treating themselves.

Finally,

Social Security hospitals are perceived to provide higher quality than
Ministry of Health hospitals, and there is perceived quality variation by
region.

VI. USER FEE SIMULATIONS
In this section we use the estimated demand functions to simulate the

effects of user fees. A uniform fee is imposed at public facilities
(hospitals and clinics). We consider two levels of fees, 10 and 20 thousand
soles. These are realistic fee levels; the average fee for a visit to a
private doctor was about 20 thousand soles. Monthly demands, revenues, and
compensating variations are calculated by summing the individual estimates
over the sample and then extrapolating to obtain population projections.

Revenues are calculated in April 1984 soles. The base for the extrapolation
is the product of the regional population and the overall regional probability

of having an illness. Two private markets scenarios are considered: (1) where
prIvate doctors do not adjust their prices in response to the changes in
public user fees, and (2) where private doctors adjust their prices by the

same amount. Further, these scenarios are analyzed under the assumption (1)
that the resulting revenues are not reinvested in the health care system, and
(2) that the revenues are used to reduce nonmonetary access costs.

A. User Fees Without Reinvestment
Columns 3, 4, and 5 of table 4 report the results of the aggregate user

fee simulations under both scenarios. They report the cumulative percentage
change in total demand, the increase in public (hospital plus clinic) revenues

and the welfare loss due to the user fee increase.12 The results show that
the imposition of moderate user fees can generate substantial public revenues
with small reductions in the total demand for health care, but, of course,

with even larger losses In consumers' welfare. Under scenario (1), for
example, a user fee of 10 thousand 5oles generates approximately an additional

6,386 million soles per month in public revenues accompanied by a 7.5 percent

19

reduction in demand and a fall of 7,123 mIllion soles In consumers' welfare.
Under scenarIo (2), that fee generates approximately 6,516 mIllion soles with
a 12.5 percent reduction in demand and a fall of 12,460 mlflion soles In
consumer welfare.

Even though the aggregate change In total demand appears to be modest,
the effects on the lower income groups are quite large and substantially

higher than in the upper income ranges. This Is demonstrated In table 5 which
shows the percentage change In total demand accounted for by each Income
quintile, and the welfare loss as a fraction of Income for each Income

quintile. On average, the lowest income quintile accounts for about 40
percent of the total decrease In the quantity of health care demand, while the

highest income quintile accounts for only about 5 percent. Not only Is the
reduction In total demand concentrated in the lowest Income groups, but the

greatest welfare loss (relative to Income) Is also borne by them. The
slrn"lations show that the lowest Income quintile suffers a reduction of

welfare of between a 3 and 11 percent of income, whereas the highest Income
groups loses less than one half of one percent.

B. User Fees With Reinvestment
In this set of experiments we assume the government uses the revenues to

reduce nonmonetary access costs. In our model nonmonetary access costs are
measured by travel time. This simulation assumes that the revenues are used
to reduce everyone's travel time to a public clinic and hospital to within one
hour or le5s (i.e. to reduce the probability of traveling more than one hour

to a public facility to zero). This is a fairly egalitarian change because
our data show that the median travel time probabilities are similar across all
income groups.

20

Columns 6, 7, and 8 of table 4 report the aggregate results for the user
fee experiment with reinvestment.

Under both scenarios, a user fee of 10

thousand soles and a reduction of travel time to less than an hour increases
total consumers' welfare, but a user fee of 20 thousand soles reduces

consumers' welfare. Therefore, at a user fee somewhere between 10 and 20
thousand soles, consumers in the aggregate are indifferent between the current

(1984) user fees and the higher user fees with easier access. The missing
component of this comparison is whether the revenues generated by this user
fee would be sufficient to cover the costs of building and operating the
additional facilities necessary to reduce travel time.
Even If revenues were sufficient, such a policy would redistribute

welfare from poorer to richer. Thi5 is demonstrated in table 6 whIch
presents the percent change in total demand within each income quintile, and

consumers' welfare loss as a fraction of income. An increase in user fees
with reinvestment would result in a substantial decrease in demand by the poor

and a slight increase in demand by the rich. In addition there would be a
relatively large welfare reduction for the poor and a slight rise In welfare
for the rich.

VII. SUPVIARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have derived a discrete choice model of the demand for medical care
from a theoretical model that implies a natural Interrelation between price
and Income.

We show that, in the context of a discrete choice model, if

health is a normal good, then the price elasticity of the demand for health

care must decline as Income rises. This Implies that the models in previous
discrete choice studies that restrict the price effect to be independent of
income are flisspecified.

21

We estimated this mode) using data from a 1984 Peruvian survey, and a
parsimonious flexible functional form. Unlike previous studies, we find that
price plays a significant role in the demand for health care, and that demand
becomes more elastic as income falls, implying that user fees would reduce the

access to care for the poor proportionally more than for the rich. Our
simulations show that user fees can generate substantial revenues, but are

accompanied by substantial reductions in aggregate consumer welfare, with the

burden of the loss on the poor. These results demonstrate that user fees
would be regressive both in terms of access and welfare.
The simulations indicate that the welfare loss for some people having to
travel more than an hour to a public health care facility is roughly equal to
the expected welfare loss from moderate user fees, and the first loss is

fairly evenly distributed across income groups. Hence, if the government
imposed moderate user fees and used the revenues to solve this access problem,
there would be little if any aggregate welfare loss, but there would be a

redistribution of welfare from poor to rich. This result is what one would
expect In an urban environment where services are fairly evenly distributed,
and may not be applicable to rural areas.
We have found that the introduction of user fees in Peru have the
potential for raising significant revenues for cost recovery by shifting the
financial burden (and commensurate welfare loss) of the health care system

from taxpayers to users. We also show that user fees are regressive both in
terms of access and welfare. In essence, the health care financing dilemma
for developing nations is that the improvement in allocative efficiency and
cost recovery from user fees are accompanied by a redistribution of welfare

from poorer to richer. A natural solution to this dilemma is to introduce
user fee schedules that increase with ability to pay. This type of price

22

discrimination may generate substantial revenues with minimum welfare loss, If
administrative costs are contained.

Recently, the pros and cons of such proposals have been discussed in
de Feranti (1985), and Jlmenez (1986).

Studies of the demand for health care in developing countries Include Akin
et. al. (1985 and 1986), Birdsall and Chuhan (1986), Heller (1983), and Mwabu

(1987).

The feasibility condition requires income to be at least as large as the
price of the alternative. The constraining level of Income depends on the
length of time over which individuals are able to budget. For example, If
capita) markets are perfect, the budget period Is the individual's lifetime
and the constraining income the present value of lifetime income. On the
other hand, if there are cash constraints, the budgeting period could be as
short the interval in which the individual is paid. In section III.C, we
propose a procedure which parameterizes the length of the budgetin9 period and
allows it to be estimated.
If, in fact, income is endogenous, there Is a possibility of simultaneity
bias. The simultaneity bias arises because an accident or illness may reduce
income. We argue in section V that the bias is likely to have a downward
Impact on the estimated price and income effects, making them closer to zero.
Hence, our estimated price elasticities should be lower bounds on the true
elasticities.

6 For example see Akin et al. (1985 and 1986), Mwabu (1986), and Birdsall
and Chuhan (1986).

An obvious extension to the semi—translog is to include interactions and
squared terms for health and nonmonetary cost terms. The problem with this is
that the health terms, as will be discussed in a moment, will be a function of
variables whose coefficients necessarily vary by alternative. Hence, this
extension would require a substantially larger parameter space. Since the
major objective of this study is to analyze price elasticities, we require
the most flexibility In the parameterizatlon of the consumption term. In
addition, this specification would violate the necessary Conditions for the
model to be consistent with utility maximization specified in Mcfadden (1981).
This point is taken up further in footenote 9.

8 See Deaton and Muelbauer (1980) for discussion of compensating variation
and other welfare measures.
In order for (12) to be exact, the marginal utility of income, X, must be
independent of alternative specific characteristics and price. See McFadden
(1981) and Small and Rosen (1981) for more discussion on this point. Although
X is independent of quality, it is not independent of price. Specifically

—

P))/(Y

and

axia =

(2a2(lnY

—

a1)/(Y

In most cases this term is likely to be small relative to X, as the
denominator is approximately income squared. Hence, X is likely to be
approximately constant across small differences is price. If indeec axia is
small, then each individual's average marginal utility of income over his/her
alternatives is a good approximation of A. Since this approximation is
calculated for each individual, A will vary greatly across individuals as
there is substantial variation in income.

10 A full description of the hedonic price and travel time methodologies and
resulting estimates is provided in the Appendix.

The critical value at the 0.05 level is 1.96. The test statistic for the null

hypothesis that k=1 is 1.06 and is distributed X2(1). The corresponding
critical value at the 0,05 level is 3.84. Our linearization of the log
consumption term biases the estimate of k towards zero. However, the observed
bias is minuscule when evaluated at the mean of the data.
12 As discussed in footnote 9, the marginal utility of income, A, is not
constant across alternatives. Each individual's average over the three
alternatives is a good approximation if the variation in A across alternatives

thousand soles \ is 0.0111, and at a price of 20 thousand soles A is 0.0115; a
difference of 0.0004. This difference declines with income, implyinQ that the
goodness of the approximation increases with income. me approximation -is poor
only at very low levels of income.

APPENDIX
The hedonic private doctor price equation specifies the price of a single
visit to be a function of the type of illness, age of the individual, and

characteristics of the market. The market variables include the number of
doctors, the number of hospital beds, the number of clinics, and the

population of the district in which the individual lives. We correct for
sample selection bias using a methodology derived in Dubin and McFadden

(1982). This requires the estimation of a reduced form multinomial logit
model of provider choice, from which a set of Dubin McFadden selection

correction terms are constructed (predicted) for each indiviaual. The
predicted correction terms are included as regressors in the hedonic price

regression. Separate models are estimated for Lima and the Sierra. The
market variables are not included in the Lima regression as there is no

variation. The estimated coefficients and t—statistics are Dresented in
table A.

The hedonic travel time equations for private doctors, hospitals, and
clinics specify the time it takes to travel to a provider to be a function of
the market variables, the location of the individual

,

a dummy variable

indicating whether the main road in the district is paved, and the Dubin
McFadden selection correction terms. An additional problem arises because we
only observe if the individual traveled more or less than an hour. The
hedonic travel time equations were estimated as binary logits. Separate Lima
and Sierra models were estimated for private doctors and hospitals, and, due

to small sample sizes, a single pooled model was estimated for clinics. The
estimated coefficients and t—statistics are also presented in table A.
