Labor-Market Matching with Precautionary Savings and Aggregate Fluctuations

ABSTRACT
We analyze a Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari incomplete-markets model with labor-market frictions. Consumers
are subject to idiosyncratic employment shocks against which they cannot insure directly. The labor
market has a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides structure: firms enter by posting vacancies and match
with workers bilaterally, with match probabilities given by an aggregate matching function. Wages
are determined through Nash bargaining. We also consider aggregate productivity shocks, and a complete
set of contingent claims conditional on this risk.
We use the model to evaluate a tax-financed unemployment insurance scheme. Higher insurance is
beneficial for consumption smoothing, but because it raises workers' outside option value, it discourages
firm entry. We find that the latter effect is more potent for welfare outcomes; we tabulate the effects
quantitatively for different kinds of consumers. We also demonstrate that productivity changes in the
model---in steady state as well as stochastic ones---generate rather limited unemployment effects,
unless workers are close to indifferent between working and not working; thus, recent findings are
corroborated in our more general setting.

Introduction

Over the last decades, a new theoretical strand of macroeconomic models has emerged that places
individual households in the center of the analysis. In the new models, compared to earlier models
relying on the representative-agent construct, households’ decision problems and welfare determinants are much closer to the microeconomic reality of households as described and analyzed in the
applied literatures using microeconomic data sets. The hope, of course, is that a more realistic microeconomic structure produces more reliable and robust macroeconomic implications. However, an
arguably even more important value of the new models lies in their usefulness for analyzing household welfare. That is, how do macroeconomic events, and aggregate policy, influence individuals
and their welfare, and in particular to what extent are different households affected differently? For
example, a series of papers shed light on how business cycles influence the cross-section of households and report a range of estimates for the potential gains, for different subgroups of consumers,
from stabilizing the cycle; some of these estimates are orders of magnitude larger than the estimates
that Lucas (2003) provided and that even put in question the relevance of analyzing cycles at all.1
In the new workhorse model, often labeled the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari (BHA) model,2 consumers face idiosyncratic earnings risks, are risk-averse, and can only insure partially—through
saving—against these risks. The model delivers a stationary distribution over households and their
asset, consumption, and income positions. Thus, risk plays a central role here, as does the idea that
poorer consumers are less well insured and thus more vulnerable to adverse outcomes. In a typical
BHA model, heterogeneity is in large part driven by exogenous employment shocks: consumers face
risks of becoming unemployed (and opportunities of regaining employment) that are calibrated to
data but not derived from first principles. The assumed exogeneity of these shocks is a potentially
serious drawback, since it implies that neither policy nor events, such as changes in productivity,
will influence them. For example, the adoption of generous unemployment benefits does not have
an impact on individuals’ employment opportunities in the BHA model. In contrast, a rich lit1

erature on matching frictions in the labor market—we label it the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides
(DMP) search/matching framework—focuses precisely on the determinants of aggregate and individual unemployment.3 Unfortunately, that literature generally relies on risk-neutral consumers:
although households face significant risks, they do not suffer from these risks, and in no sense do
consumer’s asset positions influence how they are affected by, or deal with, these risks.4 The broad
purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap between these two important literatures: we develop a
model that literally combines the BHA model and the DMP model, without losing any features of
either setting. The model we develop can be productively used in a number of applications, and
indeed a major motivation behind our work has been to provide the necessary tools allowing these
applications to be undertaken. Here, we address two questions that have been central in the two
separate literatures but so far have delivered only partial answers.
Our first question regards the optimal level of government-provided unemployment insurance
(UI). The literature on optimal unemployment insurance generally focuses on moral hazard concerns
that affect workers’ willingness to search for jobs or work. The trade-off, thus, is between providing
insurance and the incentives to work/search. Our framework, on the contrary, highlights the tradeoff between insurance and job creation: high unemployment benefits provide better insurance for
the unemployed but at the same time hurts their chances for reemployment since there is less job
creation. As a result, less than perfect insurance is optimal even in the absence of moral hazard
concerns. In our analysis, we assume that UI is financed by payroll taxes. In the BHA model, where
markets for idiosyncratic risks are missing, such insurance would raise welfare; indeed the optimal
level of insurance is full insurance. From the perspective of a labor market with matching frictions,
however, wage and unemployment outcomes are influenced by workers’ welfare as unemployed: a
higher “outside option” for workers raises the wage and lowers the incentives for firms to open new
vacancies, thus leading to a rise in unemployment. Indeed, provided the Hosios condition holds,
steady-state output in the Pissarides model is maximized when there is no UI at all. Using a
3

Classical contributions include Diamond (1981), Pissarides (1985), and Mortensen and Pissarides (1994).
It is also possible to study models where workers are risk-averse but do not have any access to any asset or
insurance markets; see, e.g., Wright (1986). However, such settings, when applied to the studies of the quantitative
welfare consequences of labor-market policies, are likely to vastly exaggerate the welfare effects through risk channels.

steady-state version of our model, we study the welfare effects of UI.
Secondly, we ask how changes in productivity—permanent as well as temporary—influence
labor-market outcomes. This is important not only as a background for analyzing household insurance when there are aggregate shocks but also in itself. There is a sharp distinction between
how productivity shocks operate in representative-agent models of labor supply and in typical
matching-friction models.5 In the former, the focus is entirely on labor supply (which we abstract
from in this paper): with consumer preferences that admit balanced growth, permanent productivity changes have no effect on hours worked or employment, though productivity fluctuations
can lead to large employment fluctuations as consumers substitute leisure over time. In the latter, where employment is constrained by frictions, both permanent and temporary productivity
increases would encourage vacancy creation and lead to lower unemployment, though a recent literature argues that these effects are much too small to explain the unemployment movements in the
data.6 How the productivity-unemployment channel operates when risk and consumption smoothing influence both individual wage formation and aggregate prices is thus the second question that
we address.
Our findings are, first, that the optimal replacement rate is quite far from the 100% rate that the
BHA setting would suggest. The precise value depends on what objective one uses, but as a rough
approximation, no major change away from the 0 replacement rate assumed in a standard BHA
model is called for from the perspective of optimal policy. Thus, the labor-market inefficiencies
that would result from raising benefits are rather strong quantitatively as compared to the benefits
from insurance over and beyond self-insurance. Second, we solve the model with aggregate shocks
and find that productivity shocks generate unemployment fluctuations in about the same way as
in the model without risk-averse consumers. Thus, in a calibration like that in Shimer (2005),
unemployment fluctuations are small, and in one like that in Hagedorn and Manovskii (HM; 2008),
they are large.

By representative-agent models here we refer to the broad class of recent models that encompass both real and
monetary shocks and various assumptions about nominal price stickiness.

In Section 2, we discuss some important background literature. The basic BHA dynamic generalequilibrium model without aggregate fluctuations is then set up in Section 3 and analyzed in Section
4. In Section 5, we extend our model to incorporate aggregate uncertainty. Section 6 concludes.

Some background

Methodologically, the main analytical challenge in solving our model is the interaction of two
elements. First, there is a nontrivial and evolving distribution of wealth among consumers, which
influences prices and aggregate quantities; and second, unlike in the one-firm neoclassical model,
there is a distribution of wage outcomes influencing worker and firm decisions. Relative to previous
work on the topic, this paper thus carefully addresses (i) wage determination, when a worker’s
outside option, because of incomplete insurance, depends on wealth; and (ii) how firms are valued
in a context where there are missing markets against idiosyncratic risks. We deal with each of these
issues directly. Thus, first, we consider Nash bargaining under which, since the worker’s indirect
utility depends on wealth, wealth will influence wages, and we characterize this dependence. Second,
we consider complete markets with respect to aggregate risk, which means that all agents who hold
equity—i.e., a share in firms—and therefore are concerned with firm valuation and firm decisions,
are unconstrained and therefore—due to market completeness—in agreement.
Quantitative studies of the DMP matching model with risk-averse workers and savings are rare
in the literature. Early and notable exceptions are Andolfatto (1996), Langot (1995), Merz (1995),
and later Den Haan et al. (2000); these papers, however, all assume that idiosyncratic risks are
fully insured.7 Valdivia (1996) studies a model closer to ours in this regard, but restricts behavior
(regarding portfolio choice and wage determination) in order to be able to solve the model. More
recently, Costain and Reiter (2005, 2007), Kallock (2006), Bils et al. (2009), Nakajima (2007),
Rudanko (2006, 2009), Shao and Silos (2007), and Jung and Kuester (2008) all studied DMP
models with risk aversion and imperfect consumption insurance. These papers vary considerably
in the ways they deal with the aforementioned challenges, but none of the papers nests both the

and Christiano et al. (2007).

DMP and BHA settings as we do here (we obtain the DMP setting if we simply set risk aversion
to zero, and the BHA setting if the matching productivity is infinite).8 On the other hand, some
of these papers consider relevant features that we abstract from: Bils et al. (2009) and Shao and
Silos (2007) allow for heterogeneous productivity of individuals, Rudanko (2006, 2009) considers
long-term wage contracts, and Jung and Kuester (2008) has wage rigidity.9
Throughout the paper, and unlike in the large real-business-cycle and new-Keynesian literatures,
we abstract from labor-supply issues: workers cannot choose hours, and they are always in a
“corner” in that if offered employment, they would always choose it. This is clearly an important
omission, because we believe that also the extensive margin is active for many households. However,
we make the omission with a clear conscience, as we think that the model development we have
offered in the present paper is a necessary first step; moreover, we have already begun researching,
so far in the context of no aggregate shocks, the case with an active extensive margin.10

The steady-state model

In this section, we develop a model without aggregate shocks, and our focus is on a stationary
equilibrium. Using the model, we then evaluate tax-financed unemployment insurance (UI).

3.1

Population, preferences, and technology

Time is discrete. There is a continuum of consumers, with measure 1, in the economy; a consumer
is either employed or unemployed. Production is decentralized; each worker produces zF (k), where
z represents the aggregate productivity level (constant in this section), F (·) is an increasing and
strictly concave production function, and k is the capital stock used by the worker. Capital de8

Costain and Reiter (2005) and Kallock (2006) do not consider capital as a neoclassical production input. Jung
and Kuester (2008) assume that there are two types of agents: some cannot save or borrow, while the others have
access to complete insurance. Bils et al. (2009), Shao and Silos (2007), and Costain and Reiter (2007) include some
risk-neutral agents (this facilitates firm evaluation). Nakajima (2007) and Shao and Silos (2007) assume some form
of “union bargaining”, thus circumventing the dependence of wages on wealth. Rudanko (2006, 2009) develops a
framework where wages are determined via long-term wage contracts and risk-averse workers are excluded from asset
markets completely.

preciates geometrically at rate δ. Workers have standard time-additive preferences with discount
factor β and do not value leisure. Output is either consumed or invested or, as we shall see below,
used for vacancy creation. The remainder of the model description focuses on the decentralized
equilibrium.

3.2

Matching

There are many firms—one for each “job”—and these firms all act competitively. Due to symmetry,
in equilibrium the same amount of k is employed at each filled job. Vacant jobs and unemployed
workers are randomly matched each period according to an aggregate matching function. The
aggregate matching function, M (u, v), represents the number of matches in a period when there
are u unemployed workers and v vacancies has standard features; we consider different functional
forms below. The probability that a vacant job is filled in the current period, λf , thus equals
M (u, v)/v = M (u/v, 1) = M (1/θ, 1), where θ ≡ v/u is the vacancy-unemployment ratio. Similarly, the probability of an unemployed worker to be employed in the current period, λw , equals
M (u, v)/u = (v/u)M (u/v, 1) = θλf . Thus, λf and λw are functions of θ. We assume that a match
is separated with probability σ in each period.11
From the above assumptions, the transition of the unemployment rate u can be described by
u′ = (1 − λw )u + σ(1 − u),
where a next period variable is denoted by a prime (′ ).

3.3

Asset structure

The consumers face idiosyncratic employment shocks, but we assume that there are no insurance
markets for these idiosyncratic shocks. The consumers can hold only two kinds of asset: capital k,
which is used as an input for production, and equity x, which is a claim to the firm’s profit. The total
11

The assumption of a constant and exogenous separation rate is made for convenience. It is potentially an
important source, or propagator, of fluctuations. However, it is arguably not likely to be the most important one,
at least not for generating the negative correlation between unemployment and vacancies. A temporary increase in
the separation rate increases unemployment in a direct way but its impact on vacancies is less powerful than that
resulting from increases in productivity or in “firm product demand.”

7

value of the firms is represented by p. Alternatively, we can say that there is one “representative
firm”—with a continuum of jobs—whose value is p. It is assumed that the consumers are not
allowed to hold the claims to the profit of individual jobs—they can only hold the claim to aggregate
profits.12 Let r be the return to capital and d be the dividend paid to the holders of equity. We
normalize the total amount of equity to one. The equity price p has to satisfy the following equation:
p=

d+p
,
1+r−δ

(1)

where δ is the depreciation rate of capital. This comes from the absence of arbitrage: one unit of
capital generates 1 + r − δ unit of return next period and one unit of equity generates (d + p)/p
unit of return (note that both assets are riskless). We use q to denote the the inverse of the gross
real interest rate: q ≡ 1/(1 + r − δ).
Since capital and equity are equivalent from the consumer’s viewpoint, we do not have to keep
track of the portfolio composition. In the following, we define
a ≡ (1 + r − δ)k + (p + d)x
and use a as the consumer’s state variable.

3.4
3.4.1

Consumers
Employed consumers

The budget constraint for an employed consumer is
c + qa′ = a + w,

(2)

where c is consumption and w is the wage rate. The wage is determined through Nash bargaining
between the firm and the worker every period, and it turns out that the wage depends on the
worker’s asset level. The details of Nash bargaining are motivated and explained later.
12

If the consumers are allowed to hold the claims to the individual job’s profit, there is an incentive for an employed
consumer to hold a short position in its own job to hedge against the risk of separation.

8

For a given wage w, employed consumers choose their capital and equity holdings subject to

(3)

subject to
c + qa′ = a + w

and a′ ≥ a.

Here, u(·) is an increasing and concave utility function, U (·) is the value function of an unemployed
consumer, and W (·) is the value function of an employed consumer, taking into account that
the wage is renegotiated next period. Let the decision rule for a′ for employed consumers be
a′ = ψ̃e (w, a). Denote the wage resulting from the Nash bargaining (detailed later) as w = ω(a).
W (a) is formally defined as
W (a) ≡ W̃ (ω(a), a).

ψe (a) ≡ ψ̃e (ω(a), a).

3.4.2

Unemployed consumers

The budget constraint for an unemployed consumer is c + qa′ = a + h, where h is the income
for an unemployed worker. h can be thought as household production. This assumption is made
so that an agent can earn some labor income even when she is unemployed. Alternatively, h can
be interpreted as unemployment insurance, as in Hansen and İmrohoroğlu (1992); we use that
interpretation in Section 4.3.

3.5

Firms

Firms create jobs, rent capital from consumers, and produce. The firm’s objective is to maximize
the discounted present value of the profits of shareholders. To create a job, a firm first posts a
vacancy. We assume that there is a flow cost of posting a vacancy and denote it by ξ. The value
of posting a vacancy, V , is

(7)

The firm discounts the future at the rate q: this is not only the market rate but also the marginal
rate of substitution of anyone with positive holdings of the firm. J(a) is the value of a job filled by
a worker whose asset level is a. Since the matching process is random, the firm can be matched
with any worker in the current period unemployment pool. fu (a) is the population of unemployed
workers with current asset level a. Thus, fu (a)/u is the density function of the unemployed workers
over a; an unemployed worker with current asset level a will has asset level ψu (a) next period. In
equilibrium, firms will post new vacancies until V = 0.

Note that J˜ depends on a since with probability 1 − σ the firm continues to be matched with the
same worker, whose next-period asset level depends on a. J˜ and J are related by
J(a) ≡ J˜(ω(a), a).

(9)

The firm’s first-order condition implies that r = zF ′ (k).
In equilibrium, the period profit is equal to
π(a) = zF (k̃) − r k̃ − ω(a),
with k̃ = k̄/(1 − u), where k̄ is the aggregate capital stock; k̃ is the amount of capital per job.
The dividend is paid out as the sum of profit minus the total vacancy cost:
Z
d = π(a)fe (a)da − ξv,
10

(10)

where fe (a) is the population of the matched workers with wealth level a. Appendix B shows that
this implies, using (1), that p + d is equal to the sum of J(a).

3.6

Wage determination

The wage is determined by (generalized) Nash bargaining. We assume that the firms do not
have commitment, so that wages are set period by period. The assumption of Nash bargaining
facilitates the comparison with the early literature, since Nash bargaining is the most commonly
used assumption under risk neutrality. The Nash-bargaining solution solves the problem

(11)

γ ∈ (0, 1) represents the bargaining power of the worker. We denote the solution w = ω(a); the
dependence of w on a stems from W̃ (w, a) − U (a) depending on a.13

3.7

Computation

We formally define the recursive stationary equilibrium of this economy in Appendix C. In the
standard BHA setting, computation of a steady state reduces to a one-dimensional fixed point
problem in the value of the capital stock. An efficient algorithm for that model is to (i) guess
on a value for the capital stock; (ii) obtain the prices (the wage and the rental rate) from the
firm’s first-order conditions for inputs (price equals marginal product); (iii) solve the consumer’s
dynamic-programming problem globally using nonlinear methods; (iv) simulate an agent’s capital
accumulation path for a large number of periods; and finally (v) compare the average capital stock
held by the agent with the initial guess, and update.
The present model cannot be computed with an algorithm that reduces to a one-dimensional
fixed-point problem; instead one needs to solve a functional fixed-point problem. The reason is that
the consumer needs to know not just two prices but the entire wage function, ω(a), to maximize
utility. Thus, the algorithm we use works as follows: (i) guess on ω(a), along with r and θ; (ii)
using the matching function and the given θ, compute the probability of finding a job; (iii)–(iv) as

Alexopoulos and Gladden (2006) examine the link between wealth and wages. They find, using data from the
1984 SIPP, that wealth increases reservation wages.

above, which also involves a straightforward contraction mapping and can be used to obtain the
distributions of employed and unemployed consumers across capital holdings; (v) given the latter,
obtain firm values by iterating on the firm’s value function (this involves no maximization and is a
contraction mapping); and (vi) given all value functions, perform Nash bargaining. Now note that
(vi) delivers an update for the wage function; (iv) gives an average total capital stock, which, since
unemployment can be computed from θ, allows us to find the per-firm capital stock, and hence we
can obtain an update for r from the firm’s capital rental decision; and (v) gives a value of entry,
which should be zero, and hence leads us to adjust the guess for θ. The fixed-point problem in
(ω, r, θ) could in principle be a very difficult one, but fortunately it turns out that it is easy to
solve for this model. The reason for this is that the ω function is mostly flat and that few agents
have capital holdings over the range where it is not flat; see the results in Section 4.2 below. The
detailed computational procedure can be found in Appendix D.

4

Steady-state experiments

We use our model economy for two main purposes: we look at the effects of unemployment insurance
(UI) and we examine how changes in productivity influences labor-market outcomes. We therefore
first calibrate the model and report its basic properties. We then look at UI policy and the effects of
productivity change. Lastly, to illustrate how our model works, we compare it to some interesting
similar models.

4.1

Calibration

One period is set to be six weeks. The production function is zF (k) = zkα . We choose α = 0.3,
δ = 0.01 and β = 0.995 using the following calibration targets: a capital share of 0.3, an investmentoutput ratio of 0.2, and annual real rate of return on capital of 0.04. The borrowing constraint a
is set at 0. In the benchmark, the aggregate productivity level z is set to 1 and we use the utility
function u(c) = log(c); in Appendix E, we also consider u(c) = c1−ζ /(1 − ζ) with ζ = 5.
The above parameters are common to all the numerical simulations that we present throughout

12

this paper. However, for the matching-related parameters we consider two different calibrations,
since the literature offers two different approaches. These calibrations mainly differ in how the
utility or consumption value of the home activity, a parameter that is hard to measure directly, is
set, and we therefore remain agnostic as to which route to take. Our benchmark calibration follows
the calibration strategy presented in Shimer (2005) and it views the value of “home production”
to be commensurate with the average level of UI. An alternative calibration, due to HM (2008),
considers home production to be only slightly below the market wage; this calibration leads to a
much stronger effect of productivity on outcomes, as we shall see.
Benchmark calibration: Shimer (2005) sets the value of the household production parameter h
to be 40% of the wage. We thus set h to 0.99 which, in equilibrium, turns out to be about 40% of
the average wage. The separation rate (σ) is set to 0.05 based on the observation by Shimer that
the monthly separation rate is 0.034. The matching function M (u, v) is M (u, v) = χuη v 1−η , as in
Shimer (2005). To calibrate χ and η, Shimer (2005) targets the market tightness to be θ = 1 and
sets χ to match the job-finding probability. A worker finds a job with a 0.45 probability per month,
so the flow arrival rate of job offers should average approximately 1 − (1 − 0.45)1.5 = 0.592 on a
six-week basis. We follow Shimer and target θ = 1 in equilibrium, which results in χ = 0.6. We set
ξ = 0.532 so that θ = 1 satisfies the equilibrium free-entry condition for posting vacancy. Shimer
estimates the elasticity of the matching function as 0.72 and sets the bargaining parameter γ = 0.72
by following the Hosios efficiency condition.14 We follow his parametrization and set η = γ = 0.72.
Alternative calibration: HM (2008) calibrate the standard matching model by using a different
approach. They choose a matching function of the form M (u, v) =
filling rate of

HM choose θ = 0.634 since the monthly job-filling rate is 0.71 and the

monthly job-finding rate is 0.45.15 We convert these rates to a six-week basis (which is our model
period). The corresponding job-filling rate is 1 − (1 − 0.71)1.5 = 0.844 and the job-finding rate is
1 − (1 − 0.45)1.5 = 0.592 which implies that θ = 0.7. Thus we set θ = 0.7. Then we choose l to

In our setting, the Hosios condition does not guarantee the constrained efficiency. This is due to the BHA
structure of the model. Dávila et al. (2005) show that the externality in capital accumulation process makes the
outcome of the standard BHA model constrained inefficient, and the same effect will be at work in our setting.

posting a vacancy as 47.4% of average weekly labor productivity and the labor cost of posting a
vacancy as 11.0% of average weekly labor productivity. In total, the vacancy cost is 58.4% of the
average wage. We set the vacancy cost ξ to be 60% of the average productivity in our model. The
corresponding value is ξ = 2.165. We choose the bargaining parameter to be γ = 0.052 following
HM. We set h to 2.29 which is the value that satisfies the free-entry condition given θ and ξ.

Table 1: Summary statistics for the Shimer and HM calibrations
Both calibrations have similar values of the unemployment rate, aggregate capital, and the average wage. The vacancy-unemployment ratio is different for these two calibrations, reflecting the
differences in the calibration strategies of Shimer (2005) and HM (2008), as are the stock price
and dividends: the vacancy cost in the HM calibration is much higher. w corresponds to the average wage realized in the economy by taking into account the asset distribution. Despite the high
value of unemployment income in the HM calibration, the average wage is higher in the Shimer
calibration, again as an artifact of the much higher vacancy cost in the HM calibration.
Figure 1 shows the wage functions.16 The observed concavity of ω(a) follows, intuitively, from
two features: (i) the function being increasing, which is due to the outside option being worse for
consumers with a low stock of assets (since their buffer against unemployment shocks is lower), and
(ii) a natural upper bound, which is given by that value which a risk-neutral agent would obtain in
16

Note that the range of the vertical axis is different on the left and right panels to highlight the differences in wage
functions for the two calibrations.

the bargaining (as in the DMP model), and this value is approached here for consumers with infinite
asset holdings since they are “perfectly insured.”17 It turns out that with our parametrization, the
wages are only increasing significantly for the as that are very close to the borrowing constraint.
We provide more detailed discussion on the wage function in Appendix E where we also consider
different preferences with higher risk aversion.
How much wage dispersion is created by asset inequality jointly with our wage-determination
process? Very little, especially with the HM calibration. Using the mean-min ratio as a measure,
the Shimer calibration delivers 1.02 and the HM calibration 1.0002.18 These numbers would go up
in a model where asset inequality is more pronounced.
17

Acemoglu and Shimer (2000) build a model of risk-averse workers searching for different types of jobs. They
assume that high-paying jobs are more difficult to find. With the assumption of CRRA utility, wealthier workers are
less risk-averse and they tend to apply for higher-paying jobs. As a result, there is a positive association between
wealth and wages through a different mechanism than ours.
18
Hornstein et al. (2006) suggest the mean-min ratio—the ratio of the mean wage to the minimum wage—as a
useful measure of frictional wage inequality.

Welfare effects of UI

From the perspective of the precautionary-savings literature—the BHA model—direct insurance
against unemployment is clearly welfare-improving from the individual’s perspective. Is it desirable,
taking general-equilibrium effects into account? In the BHA model, yes, but not necessarily in the
present model, since such insurance will influence wage formation and, therefore, firms’ incentives
to enter. In particular, wages will rise, deterring entry. We now study how these two effects play
out.
We assume that financing of the UI payments using taxes that are proportional to wages. We
also assume that there is no home production so that all the income for the unemployed workers
comes from the unemployment insurance. The budget constraints for the employed and unemployed
workers now become
c + qa′ = a + (1 − τ )w

and

c + qa′ = a + (1 − τ )h,

respectively, where h is the government-financed unemployment insurance. For a given h, the
government sets τ to balance its period-by-period budget constraint:

Effects on quantities

In this section, we use the Shimer calibration. Figure 2 reveals how wages, capital, and unemployment are influenced by UI in the long run. A higher h increases the relative value of the outside
option for the workers and increases the wage. This reduces the firm’s incentive to post vacancies,
and hence unemployment rises. The improvement in insurance, however, also reduces the capitallabor ratio, k̄/(1 − u), through the decline in precautionary saving: the capital-labor ratio falls
from 72.17 to 72.07 when h increases from 0.00 to 1.50. This calculation suggests that steady-state
output is the highest with zero (or even negative) UI; indeed, this is the case for our calibration.

Welfare

Rather than compute full transition dynamics as a result of a change in the level of UI, we compare
steady states with different levels of UI. As is clear from above, however, a straight comparison
of, say, average utility across steady states will not do justice to UI, since high UI levels are
associated with low long-run levels of capital. Therefore, we report an alternative welfare measure
that is more neutral with regard to these comparisons. Assume, therefore, that we are looking at
a number of different “countries,” each with a different UI level and each in a steady state, but
otherwise identical. One of these countries is our benchmark economy with h = 0.99. Now imagine
moving each of the consumers in the benchmark economy, along with her employment status and
asset holdings, into each of the other economies and then comparing utilities. For example, if an
unemployed consumer moves to a high-UI economy, she will benefit in the short run from higher
income, but she will also suffer in the future from having a lower wage when employed; a very rich
unemployed consumer might also gain a significant amount since interest rates are higher in the
high-UI economy. Our welfare measure in these comparisons, λ, is defined from

Table 2: Average values of λ, compared to the benchmark of h = 0.99.

It turns out that almost everyone (everyone except for the very poorest unemployed workers,
who are borrowing-constrained) gains from lowering h to 0.75. The average gain can be increased
by lowering h further to 0.25—in fact, the amount of h that maximizes the average gain is about
0.30. Recall that as we lower h, the profitability of a match increases and this induces more vacancy
posting and reduces unemployment. This favors a lower value of h. However, there are two negative
welfare effects coming from a lower h. The first is that the (before-tax) wage rate declines with lower
h—this is a consequence of Nash bargaining. The second is the direct effect of lowering the UI: a
lower h means less insurance for unemployed workers. Almost for all values of h, the positive effect
of lowering h dominates, and welfare increases as we lower h. However, if h is lowered to values
close enough to zero, the welfare starts to decline because of the negative effects. We show the λ

It is straightforward to conduct the same welfare analysis using a standard Aiyagari (1994)
model. The welfare outcomes are not entirely trivial, since a change in UI does influence capital
accumulation and hence prices; moreover, it involves redistribution. We find, not surprisingly,
that welfare is monotonically increasing in h for the unemployed in that economy, whereas the
employed experience very small welfare changes. That is, we assume that the employment process
is exogenously given with the job finding rate at 0.6 and the job separation rate at 0.05. (Therefore,
the unemployment rate is fixed at 7.69% regardless of the value of h.) Since the employment
process is given exogenously, unemployment insurance and taxes are non-distortionary. Thus,
perfect insurance (w = h) achieves a Pareto efficient outcome. There is still some disagreement
among the workers, since the insurance involves income transfer between the unemployed and the
employed, and since a change in precautionary savings influence the wage and the interest rates,
which the people with different wealth positions benefit differentially from. The comparison of our

19

model with the Aiyagari model reveals the importance of incomplete asset markets and endogenous
labor-market frictions. If a policy maker used the average λ to measure the desirability of the policy,
a lower unemployment insurance level would be recommended if our model were used, whereas a
much higher level would be recommended if the Aiyagari model were used.

4.4

Productivity and labor-market outcomes

Permanent changes in productivity have no effect on employment in macroeconomic models built
around labor supply, as long as the preferences over consumption and leisure admit balanced growth.
In contrast, in models where employment is determined by labor-market frictions and labor supply
plays no role, productivity does have an effect. The question is how large the effect is, both in the
long and in the short run. In this section, we answer the former of these questions.
We consider a 2% deviation in aggregate productivity. Table 3 presents the summary statics
for different z values for the Shimer calibration.

In the table (and all the following tables that involves the comparison across different z), we

and k̄ = 68.52 for z = 1.02. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio (θ) increases with z as well, as
does the employment rate, equity prices, and dividends. Note that quantitatively, the differences
in u are very small compared to what we see in business cycle data. This echoes Shimer’s (2005)
finding that the DMP model with linear utility generates very small unemployment and vacancy
fluctuations. Figure 4 (left panel) shows the wage functions for different values of z and assets; the
wage schedule moves up and down with z.

Figure 4: Wages for different zs for the Shimer calibration (left panel) and the HM calibration
(right panel).
HM (2008) suggests that when the parameter values are calibrated differently from Shimer
(2005), the DMP model exhibits much larger labor-market fluctuations in response to changes in
z. HM demonstrated this in a model with linear utility. For comparison purposes, we present the
results from our model with a HM-type calibration.
Table 4 presents the summary statics for different z values for the HM calibration. As in HM
(where a linear utility function was used), the response of unemployment and vacancies is much
larger with this calibration. Firm profits change more with z, leading to a larger change in θ and
v, resulting in a large response in u. When u changes substantially, the marginal product of capital
changes and, as a result, k̄ also changes. Figure 4 (right panel) shows the change in wages. First,

note that the wage functions (as functions of a) are flatter than the benchmark wage functions.
21

Second, here the wage responds less to the change in z, compared to the benchmark case. A smaller
response in the wage implies a larger response in the firm’s profit, contributing to a larger change
in θ.

Alternative models

In this section, we compare our present model to two similar models that are of interest.
4.5.1

Linear utility

risk. In Appendix F, we show that the solution of this model delivers

The idea here is to compare the effects of productivity across the linear model and the benchmark
model. More precisely, we set all the parameters except for ξ to be the same as in our original
models (with the benchmark Shimer calibration and the HM calibration). First, let z = 1.00 and
set ξ so that (12) holds with θ = 1.20 Note that y is defined in (13) and r = 1/β − 1 + δ. The

Table 5: Summary statistics for the linear model and for the incomplete markets model.
Now, we change z. (12) can be solved for θ (note that the value of y is different for each z), then
(15) can be solved for u, and finally (16) can be solved for k̄. Table 5 summarizes the result. The
results are remarkably similar to those in our incomplete-markets model with log utility (reproduced
here from Tables 3 and 4). Moreover, this result is not an artifact of having a low number of agents
on the curved part of the wage function. In Appendix G, we look at a slightly different model in
order to be able to accommodate more larger dispersion in wealth.21 In particular, we generate
wealth dispersion that is such that a much larger fraction of workers are in the upward-sloping part
of the wage curve. We find that, despite a much larger mass of agents in the curved part of the
wage distributions, the responses of the economy to changes in z are remarkably similar to those in
the linear model. The intuition is that, with Nash bargaining, the wage function moves with z in a
parallel manner, and thus the impact of z on a firm’s profit is uniform across different matches. We
also consider a model with higher risk aversion in Appendix E and find that the incomplete-markets
model under higher risk aversion behaves similarly to the linear model.
21

The previous literature, including Huggett (1996) and Krusell and Smith (1998), discuss the importance of, and
the difficulties in, generating realistic wealth heterogeneity in models with realistic income/employment processes.

All the benefit while unemployed is thus given to the unemployed agents in terms of consumption
goods. In this section we consider a variation of this model by lowering h by 0.01 (from 2.29 to
2.28) and instead giving the unemployed consumers some (separable) utility ul from leisure so that
the total utility for the unemployed worker is the same in both economies. With h = 2.28, this
requires ul = 0.004. Thus for our experiments here we use

Table 6: Summary statistics for different z values (alternative HM calibration).
Table 6 shows the statistics when we vary z. Figure 5 shows the wage function for the baseline
and alternative HM calibrations. Clearly, the wage is increasing over the entire domain of a when
there is utility from leisure. The intuition is that the utility from leisure is constant for everyone,
while the utility from goods is subject to diminishing marginal utility. Since wages are given
by goods, for each given wage, the utility from unemployment is relatively high for wealth-rich
consumers. Therefore, they have higher bargaining power. When a large value is assigned for ul ,
the surplus from very wealthy consumer’s match becomes negative, so employed workers choose to
separate once they become wealthy. Such endogenous separation (and labor supply decision) is an
interesting mechanism, but beyond the scope of the current paper.22
22

Krusell et al. (2008, 2009a, 2009b) explore endogenous separation in an “island” model of unemployment, and
Bils et al. (2009) look at a similar model.

The model with aggregate shocks

We now incorporate aggregate uncertainty: aggregate productivity shocks. There are two broad
reasons for introducing aggregate shocks. One is substantive: the steady-state analysis above only
gives an indication of aggregate dynamics, since a model with capital and consumption smoothing
implies that labor-market tightness will have nontrivial short-run dynamics. Indeed, as indicated
above, the model will generate stochastic processes for aggregates that, at least under some parameter configurations, are broadly in line with available U.S. data. The second reason for looking
at the model with aggregate shocks is methodological: it provides a “how-to” for what we believe
is a range of potentially very interesting applications. There are two methodological issues of importance: the evaluation of firm profits (how are they priced, and how are dynamic firm decisions
made?) and the numerical implementation, which is significantly more involved than that in Krusell
and Smith (1998, 1997).23
Like in Krusell and Smith (1998), we assume that the aggregate productivity z is either good
23

We do not look at a version with larger wealth dispersion for the aggregate-uncertainty economy, since the
steady-state analysis suggests that the aggregate results would not change much.

25

(z = g) or bad (z = b), with g > b, and follows a first-order Markov process, with the probability of
moving from state z to state z ′ denoted by πzz ′ . Unlike in Krusell and Smith, however, we do not
need to make additional assumptions about individual employment shocks (and their correlation
with aggregates) since they are endogenous here.

5.1

Asset structure

Again, we assume that there are no insurance markets for the idiosyncratic shocks. Agents can
hold only two kinds of asset—capital k and equity x. Here, again, the equity x is the claim for
the aggregate profit. We continue to assume that the consumers are not allowed to hold claims to
the profits from individual jobs. Now, the difference from the previous section is that capital and
equity have different return structures, so the consumers face a portfolio choice problem.
Let S be the joint distribution of asset and employment across the consumers. Then the
aggregate state at any given period can be described by (z, S).
The distribution of assets across the consumers in the next period is determined in the current
period, since it depends on the consumers’ asset accumulation and portfolio choice decisions, which
are governed by the current state (z, S). The distribution of the employment states at the aggregate
level in the next period is determined in the current period by the number of vacancies (the firm’s
decision) and unemployment, which are also governed by (z, S). Thus, next period’s state S ′ is
determined by (z, S). Let us write this dependence as S ′ = Ω(z, S). It is important to note that
even though S ′ is already determined by the current state, the employment state of each individual
in the next period is still uncertain.
By above argument, there are only two possible (and uncertain) values of the aggregate states
next period: (g, S ′ ) and (b, S ′ ). We can span these states by the two “aggregate” assets that we
have—capital and equity. Note that the asset markets are still incomplete, since there are no assets
for insuring against idiosyncratic risks. Below, when we consider the consumer’s decisions, we
will consider a portfolio choice between two “Arrow securities”: securities each of which provides
one unit of consumption good in one of the aggregate states and nothing in the other.24 This is
24

Krusell and Smith (1997) also have two assets but do not use contingent claims in their implementation.

26

without loss of generality, since we can create these securities by combining capital and equity. For
ease of exposition, below we introduce an entity called an “investment firm” that performs this
transformation.
Suppose that the current state is (z, S). Let Qz ′ (z, S) be the price of an Arrow-security that
pays out one unit of consumption good when the next-period state is z ′ . Let the interest rate be
r(z, S) and the equity price be p(z, S). Then, from no arbitrage, the asset prices have to satisfy
Qg (z, S)(1 − δ + r(g, S ′ )) + Qb (z, S)(1 − δ + r(b, S ′ )) = 1

(17)

p(z, S) = Qg (z, S)[p(g, S ′ ) + d(g, S ′ )] + Qb (z, S)[p(b, S ′ ) + d(b, S ′ )],

(18)

and

where d(z, S) is the dividend. (17) and (18) show that there is a one-to-one mapping between
{r(z, S), p(z, S)} and {Qg (z, S), Qb (z, S)} for a given d(z, S).

5.2

Consumers

Consumers in the economy choose their demand for Arrow securities subject to a budget constraint.
We impose an exogenous borrowing constraint for each contingent claim at a. Consumers in the
economy differ in their employment status and asset holdings.
5.2.1

Employed consumers

Let a′z ′ be the demand of an Arrow security that pays out one unit of consumption good in the
next period if next period’s state is z ′ .
Let W̃ (w, a; z, S) be the value of being an employed consumer, given the wage w. An employed
worker’s optimization problem is
W (a; z, S) =

max

a′g ≥a,a′b ≥a

u(c) + β[ πzg (σU (a′g ; g, S ′ ) + (1 − σ)W (a′g ; g, S ′ ))

5.3

Firms

In order to be able to get matched with a worker and produce, a firm posts a vacancy.25 Let the
vacancy cost be ξ. The value of a vacancy V (z, S) is
R
V (z, S) = −ξ +Qg (z, S)((1 − λf (z, S))V (g, S ′ ) + λf (z, S) J(ψug (a; z, S); g, S ′ )[fu (a; S)/u]da)
R
+Qb (z, S)((1 − λf (z, S))V (b, S ′ ) + λf (z, S) J(ψub (a; z, S); b, S ′ )[fu (a; S)/u]da),
(23)
where J(a; z, S) is the value of a matched job (taking into account the wage bargaining) and fu (a; S)
is the population of unemployed workers with asset a. The worker-finding probability λf (z, S) is
defined as in Section 3.2. The firm will post vacancies v(z, S) until V (z, S) = 0. Note that the
firm discounts the future value by Arrow security prices. This is because these values correspond
to the rates at which the non-constrained consumers discount each future state. In our numerical
exercise below, it turns out that (almost) no one is at the borrowing constraint; therefore, this way
of discounting is (almost) unanimously supported.
Let us consider a job matched with a worker with asset holdings a. The firm rents capital
from the consumers at a rental rate of r(z, S) and pays the worker a wage of ω(a; z, S). The
output is determined by the production function zF (k). The value of a filled job given the wage
˜ a; z, S), is
w, J(w,
˜ a; z, S) = π̃(w; z, S) +Qg (z, S)(σV (g, S ′ ) + (1 − σ)J(ψ̃eg (w, a; z, S); g, S ′ ))
J(w,
+Qb (z, S)(σV (b, S ′ ) + (1 − σ)J(ψ̃eb (w, a; z, S); b, S ′ )),

(24)

where the flow profit π̃(w; z, S) is defined as
π̃(w; z, S) = max zF (k) − r(z, S)k − w.
k

(25)

From the first-order condition,
r(z, S) = zF ′ (k)
holds. In equilibrium, the capital stock per job is k̃ = k̄/(1 − u), where k̄ is the aggregate capital
stock. Thus, the equilibrium profit is
π(a; z, S) = zF (k̃) − r(z, S)k̃ − ω(a; z, S).
25

We envision a “representative firm” as a collection of jobs, and it thus posts several vacancies.

29

J˜ and J are related by
J(a; z, S) = J˜(ω(a; z, S), a; z, S).

(26)

The dividend is determined by aggregating the profits of all matched firms in the economy as
d(z, S) =

Z

π(a; z, S)fe (a; S)da − ξv,

(27)

where fe (a; S) is the population of employed workers with asset a. Note that since wages paid by
firms depend on the asset positions of the workers that they are matched with, dividends depend
on the wealth distribution of the employed consumers in the economy.

5.4

Wage determination

Vacant jobs and unemployed workers are randomly matched each period according to the aggregate
matching function M (u, v), which is identical to the one we defined in the previous section. A
realized match produces some pure economic rent that is shared by the firm and the worker through
Nash bargaining. The wage that the firm pays a worker with asset holdings a is determined by

Investment firms

There are competitive investment firms who sell contingency claims to consumers by rearranging
capital and equities. For the asset market to clear, it has to be that, for each z ′ ,

Asset prices, moreover, have to satisfy (17) and (18) have to hold.

5.6

Computation

Given all the above, the definition of a recursive competitive equilibrium is straightforward.26 The
computation of our model, however, is considerably more complex than for standard incomplete

It is stated in Appendix H. Appendix I also shows that when the above conditions are satisfied, the resource
balance condition (goods market clearing condition) is satisfied.

markets models. In addition to the problems we faced in the model without aggregate shocks,
now the distribution of asset and employment moves around endogenously over time, and this
information is an input in the consumer’s optimization problem. The complexity is similar to that
in Krusell and Smith (1998, 1997). In our setting, however, since unemployment is not summarized
by an exogenously given stochastic process, the aggregate productivity shock z is no longer the sole
determinant of the unemployment rate. As a consequence, we need more aggregate state variables
than in previous settings.
Following Krusell and Smith (1998), we study a setting where consumer have boundedly rational
perceptions of the evolution of the aggregate state, since we hope that “approximate aggregation”
will hold. Thus, we assume that the consumer perceives next period’s aggregate capital stock,
k̄′ , to be a (log-)linear function of (z, k̄, u), where u is an additional state relative to the setting
without labor-market frictions. Since there are other nontrivial market-clearing conditions, we also
need to model the resulting outcomes—for θ, p, d, and Qz —as simple (typically linear) functions
of (z, k̄, u).27 After computing the equilibrium based on these assumptions and simulating the
economy, we check whether these perceptions are accurate. This indeed turns out to be the case,
as we will show below.
The main steps of our algorithm, using the z = g case for illustration, are as follows.
1. Postulate the law of motion for k̄ by assuming that k̄′ is a function of (z, k̄, u).
2. Assume that θ, p, d, and Qg are functions of (z, k̄, u) and guess on coefficients of prediction
rules.
3. Calculate u′ from u′ = (1 − λw (θ))u + σ(1 − u).
27

An alternative procedure is to include an extra step, where the consumers solve an auxiliary optimization problem
that include θ, p, d, and Qg as additional state variables and make sure that the equilibrium conditions regarding
these variables hold at this stage. This procedure is suggested by, for example, Rı́os-Rull (1999). In our current
setting, this will increase computational burden substantially. It turns out that (as is stated in Section 5.8 and
detailed in Appendices L and M) our prediction rules are very accurate so that we believe that including this extra
step will not alter the results. Chang and Kim (2006) utilize a computational method that is similar to ours.

31

4. Calculate Qb by using Qg from
Qg (z, k̄, u)(1 − δ + r(g, k̄′ , u′ )) + Qb (z, k̄, u)(1 − δ + r(b, k̄′ , u′ )) = 1.
5. Perform the individual optimization and Nash bargaining.
6. Simulate the economy using the result from the previous step. Generate data on k̄, p, d, Qg ,
θ. Check if it is consistent with the predictions in the first step. If not, revise the prediction
rules and continue until convergence.
The detailed algorithm that we use is described in Appendix J.

5.7

Calibration

We follow the same calibration as in Section 4.1. Aggregate shocks take the values z ∈ {b, g} =
{0.98, 1.02} following Cooley and Prescott (1995).28 πij is the probability of the transition from
state i to state j. Following Krusell and Smith (1999) and Krusell et al. (2009c), we set the average
business-cycle duration to 2 years. Our model period is six weeks; therefore the average duration
is 16 periods. From 1/(1 − πbb ) = 1/(1 − πgg ) = 16, πbb = πgg = 0.9375.

5.8

Results: the Shimer calibration

The laws of motion for k̄, θ, p + d, Qg , and Qb are presented in Appendix K. Approximate
aggregation seems to hold up very well in the present setting. The R2 of this prediction rules are
above 0.999, i.e., very high. We also report additional accuracy checks in Appendix L. The average
aggregate capital is k̄ = 66.65 for z = b and k̄ = 67.22 for z = g.
Table 7 summarizes the statistics for each state from our simulations. All the values are shown
as percentage deviations of the average value in each state from the total average, except for u
(which is in levels). The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio (θ) increases with z, but the fluctuations
in θ are not realistic in magnitude; this is the fact discussed in Shimer (2005) and Hall (2005).
Similarly, the unemployment rate is negatively correlated with the aggregate productivity shock,
28

This is consistent with the unconditional standard deviation of the Solow residual in Cooley and Prescott (1995).

that k̄ increases when z = g and decreases when z = b, and θ is not constant over time conditional
on an aggregate state: as the capital stock adjusts, the profitability of firm entry changes. For
example, if z moves from b to g and there is no immediate switch back, θ jumps; the capital stock
will start increasing, and as it increases, θ will keep increasing further.29 The reason is that more
capital availability will make capital cheaper to rent.

up. For a given u, this means a large increase in v. This will make u go down significantly in
the following period. If the aggregate state is still g in the following period, θ will remain high
(and even increase somewhat), but since u is now lower, v must fall as well (but remain higher
than prior to the z switch). Subsequently, if z continues to be g, v and u will keep moving, and
in opposite directions, since a rising θ reflects higher entry and a lower jobless rate.30 When z
switches from g to b, we see the opposite pattern. Note that the comparative steady states in the
previous section describe the situation after the adjustment of k (and u) was completed, that is,
after z has continued to be at the same state for a long time. The results in this section suggest
that this adjustment is fairly slow. This explains why the unemployment fluctuations here are not
as large as those we saw across steady states with different productivities.

on either of the two “thick,” circled (low-v, or z = b) or squared (high-v, or z = g), lines; they
correspond to the paths u and v travel once the economy has been in one of the z states for several
consecutive periods. On these thick lines, as time passes without a new z switch, u and v move in
opposite directions, as θ adjusts. This can be compared with the θ movements in a model without
capital and concave utility: there, θ can only take on as many values as there are values for z, and
so will capital (if there is capital in the model); here, because of consumption smoothing, capital
must move slowly, as must θ, within each aggregate state. The other lines in the figure are points
the economy reaches in the period of a switch.32

Results: the Hagedorn and Manovskii calibration

In this section, we examine the calibration by Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008). The laws of motion
for k̄, θ, p + d, Qg , and Qb are presented in Appendix K.
Approximate aggregation seems to obtain here as well for the main variables, though there are
larger errors for θ and for the stock price. Table 8 summarizes the statistics for each state from the

Aggregate statistics more broadly

In this subsection, we evaluate the model’s performance to match the fluctuations in aggregate
variables. The standard deviation of output is 0.0138 for the Shimer calibration and 0.0159 for the
HM calibration. In the U.S. economy, the unemployment rate and vacancies are negatively correlated. Shimer (2005) reports that the correlation of HP-filtered unemployment rate and vacancies
is −0.894 for U.S. data.33 In our model with a Shimer calibration, the correlation coefficient of the
cyclical components of unemployment rate and vacancies is −0.84, while for the HM calibration this
statistic is −0.55. Figure 9 shows the HP-filtered Beveridge curves for both calibration exercises.

The details of the calculation of the reported statistics can be found in Appendix M. This appendix also contains
a table that reports the standard deviations of stock prices and dividends relative to the standard deviation of output.

37

Our Shimer calibration produces less output fluctuations and much lower fluctuations in the
vacancy-unemployment ratio. This type of finding has been documented by Andolfatto (1996),
Hall (2005), and Shimer (2005), among others. They find that the standard DMP model cannot
generate the observed fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies. Our finding is similar—our
results suggest that that market incompleteness does not improve the performance of the DMP
model in matching the magnitude of unemployment fluctuations. Since the benchmark result falls
short in generating fluctuations in unemployment, it also cannot match the fluctuations in output.
The HM calibration generates much larger fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies, and the
result comes closer to the actual data.
Table 19 in the Appendix M also reports that our benchmark model underpredicts the fluctuations in stock prices. That is, it is also subject to the stock-market volatility puzzle. The
HM calibration leads to much larger fluctuations in stock prices as measured by p. Measured
by p + k̄, the fluctuations in stock prices are much smaller. Dividends (measured by either d or
d + (1 + r − δ)k̄ − k̄′ ) fluctuate much more than in the data, and the puzzle of the relative volatility
between stock prices and dividends remains unsolved. In our framework, the two volatility puzzles
(those for the stock-market volatility and for labor market fluctuations) seem closely related. As
can be seen from the results based on the HM calibration, if we can generate fluctuations in stock
prices of a realistic magnitude, we will be able to generate more realistic labor-market fluctuations.
This is because the stock price reflects future profits (p + d is the sum of Js in the economy),
and future profits drive the firm’s vacancy-posting decision (v increases as J increases). The HM
calibration achieves this, while it overpredicts the volatility of the dividends.
Table 10 reports the correlation between a range of variables (investment, consumption, the labor share, wages, and the vacancy-unemployment) and output for the data and our model (for both
calibrations). In the U.S. economy, the labor share is countercyclical. Rı́os-Rull and SantaeulàliaLlopis (2007) reports a correlation coefficient of −0.24 between the labor share and output, while
Andolfatto (1996) reports this number to be −0.38. Our model generates a countercyclical labor
share with a correlation of −0.99 for the Shimer calibration and −0.98 for the HM calibrations.

38

Clearly, this correlation would fall substantially if the model had more than one aggregate shock.

The alternative models again

Here we revisit the alternative models from Section 4.5 to see how they behave when they are
subject to aggregate shocks; we also consider a model with complete markets.
5.11.1

Linear utility and a complete-markets model

The comparison to known versions of this model should also be of interest. We outline these in the
Appendix, sections N and O.35 The first version is the linear version, i.e., that with linear utility
but otherwise like the present model. The second version is a model with complete consumption
insurance across households: a Merz-Andolfatto model. As suspected from the above analysis of
steady states, the labor-market fluctuations are very similar in the main model in this paper and in
the linear model. These models differ greatly, however, in their implications for consumption and
investment, whose fluctuations in the linear model are far larger (than in our benchmark model and
than in data). As for the Merz-Andolfatto model, it behaves very similarly to our benchmark model,
both in terms of its labor-market features and its implications for consumption and investment.36
35

In the case of the complete-markets model, we define equilibrium and solve for it differently than in the original
Merz-Andolfatto papers; we adhere to individual Nash bargaining, but treat workers as “assets.” This formulation
allows the study of equilibria where the wage setting does not satisfy the Hosios condition.
36
In Appendix P we provide a detailed comparison of our model with the linear and complete-markets versions of
the DMP model. Note that in the linear model, consumption and investment are allowed to be negative. For that

UI as a utility benefit

In this section, we consider the alternative specification in Section 4.5.2—that is, we give the
consumers utility from leisure. The results are summarized in Tables 11 and 12. The model
behavior is similar to the baseline HM calibration case.

Conclusion

We introduce one additional element into the Pissarides (1985) model: workers are risk-averse
(and cannot perfectly insure consumption). This elaboration on the standard matching model can
equivalently be described as a BHA incomplete-markets model with aggregate shocks and with one
additional element: labor-market frictions. We find that approximate aggregation holds, making
model solution feasible despite a number of new elements relative to earlier models with aggregate
shocks and nontrivially varying wealth distributions.
Our positive findings are that for all the parameter configurations considered, labor-market aggregates behave almost as in the linear-utility model counterparts, and that the consumption and
investment fluctuations behave as in the typical representative-agent real-business-cycle model. If
we adopt Hagedorn and Manovskii’s (2008) view, that is, we set the monetary value of unemployment to be very high, then the resulting setting has significant fluctuations in unemployment and
vacancies, and the other aggregate variables behave in realistic ways as well (e.g., the labor share is
countercyclical and real wages fluctuate relatively little). If, in contrast, we adopt the calibrations
in Hall (2005) or Shimer (2005), the fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies are significantly
lower than in the data.
Our model can serve as a framework for analyzing various stabilization and social-insurance
policies. We consider a simple example in Section 4.3 and analyze the welfare effects of unemployment insurance in our model. We find that endogenizing unemployment by using a search-matching
framework results in significantly different implications than those found in standard BHA models
with exogenously given employment processes: UI is much less desirable than it would be in a
model where partial insurance is the only friction.
What would the implications of UI have in economies with aggregate fluctuations? We speculate
that under the Shimer calibration, since aggregate shocks do not influence individual risks much
at all, the value of making UI cyclical is likely small; moreover, its optimal level—we presume that
UI is funded by constant taxes (i.e., the government budget balances on average but not period by
period)—would look very similar to that in the steady-state version of the model. Under the HM
41

calibration, individual unemployment risk is, in contrast, highly influenced by aggregate shocks,
but because the value of being unemployed is so close to the value of being employed in this kind of
calibration, there is very little to insure, and UI policy is not likely to generate significant welfare
gains.
One dimension in which the benchmark model is not empirically satisfactory is in the dispersion of wealth and wages. Wages differ only because workers’ bargaining power depend on their
asset holdings; moreover, the effect of wealth on wages is very slight for most asset levels. Wealth,
therefore, differs among workers only due to past employment luck. Since many elements of heterogeneity are left out—worker ability, match quality, preferences, etc.—it is an open question as
to what our target wealth dispersion should be. Future versions of the present setting ought to
incorporate these elements, and it is an open question whether approximate aggregation will continue to hold then, and how the positive findings for aggregates that we obtain here will change.
The analysis of steady states with multiple discount factors, however, indicates that at least some
models with large wealth dispersion will (i) be feasible to study and (ii) yield similar predictions
to those obtained here.
