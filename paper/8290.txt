In

John Taylor (1980), Julio Rotemberg (1982), and Guillermo Calvo
(1983).

The implications of our sticky-information model, however,
are closer to those of Stanley Fischer's (1977) contracting model.
As in the Fischer model, the current price level depends on
expectations of the current price level formed quite far in the
past.

In the Fischer model, those expectations matter because

they are built into contracts.

In our model, they matter because

some price setters are still setting prices based on old decisions

and old information.1
After introducing the sticky-information model in Section I,
we examine the dynamic response to monetary policy in Section II.
In contrast to the standard sticky-price model, which allows for
the possibility of disinflationary booms, the sticky-information
model predicts that disinflations always cause recessions.

In

some ways, the dynamic response in the sticky-information model
resembles Phillips curves with backward-looking expectations.

Yet

there is an important difference: In the sticky-information model,

In

particular, the farther in advance a disinflationary policy is
anticipated, the smaller is the resulting recession.
In Section III we make the model more realistic by adding a
simple yet empirically plausible stochastic process for the money
supply.

After calibrating the model, we examine how output and

inflation respond to a typical monetary policy shock.

We find

that the sticky-price model yields implausible impulse response
1

We should also note several other intellectual antecedents.
Gabaix and Laibson (2000) suggest that consumption behavior is
better understood with the assumption that households update their
optimal consumption only sporadically; it was in fact a
presentation of the Gabaix-Laibson paper that started us working
on this project. Another related paper is Ball (2000), who tries
to explain price dynamics with the assumption that price setters
use optimal univariate forecasts but ignore other potentially
relevant information. In addition, Rotemberg and Woodford (1997)
assume a one-period decision lag for some price setters. Finally,
after developing our model, we became aware of Koenig (1997);
Koenig's model of aggregate price dynamics is motivated very
differently from ours and is applied to a different range of
questions, but it has a formal structure that is similar to the
model explored here.

Section V concludes.

We consider how our sticky-information

model relates to the broader new Keynesian literature on price
adjustment.

We also mention one piece of microeconomic evidence

that favors this new model over the alternatives.

I. A Tale of Two Models
We begin by deriving the two models: the standard stickyprice model, which yields the new Keynesian Phillips curve, and
the proposed sticky-information model.

A Sticky-Price Model: The New Keynesian Phillips Curve

4

Here we review the standard derivation of the new Keynesian
Phillips curve, as based on the Calvo model.

In this model, firms

follow time-contingent price adjustment rules.

The time for price

adjustment does not follow a deterministic schedule, however, but
arrives randomly.
prices.

Every period, a fraction λ of firms adjust

Each firm has the same probability of being one of the

adjusting firms, regardless of how long it has been since its last
price adjustment.
We start with three basic relationships.

The first concerns

the firm's desired price, which is the price that would maximize
profit at that moment in time.

With all variables expressed in

logs, the desired price is:
p*t = pt + αyt.
This equation says that a firm's desired price p* depends on the
overall

price

level

p

and

output

y.

(Potential

output

is

normalized to zero here, so y should be interpreted as the output
gap.)

A firm's desired relative price, p*-p, rises in booms and

falls in recessions.
Although we won't derive this equation from a firm's profit
maximization problem, one could easily do so, following Blanchard
and Kiyotaki (1987).

Imagine a world populated by identical

monopolistically competitive firms.

When the economy goes into a

boom, each firm experiences increased demand for its product.
Because marginal cost rises with higher levels of output, greater
demand means that each firm would like to raise its relative

5

price.
In this model, however, firms rarely charge their desired
prices, because price adjustment is infrequent.

When a firm has

the opportunity to change its price, it sets its price equal to
the average desired price until the next price adjustment.

The

adjustment price x is determined by the second equation:
∞
xt = λ Σ (1-λ)j Etp*t+j
j=0
According to this equation, the adjustment price equals a weighted
average of the current and all future desired prices.

Desired

prices farther in the future are given less weight because the
firm may experience another price adjustment between now and that
future date.

This possibility makes that future desired price

less relevant for the current pricing decision.

The rate of

arrival for price adjustments, λ, determines how fast the weights
decline.
The third key equation in the model determines the overall
price level p:
∞
pt = λ Σ (1-λ)j xt-j
j=0
According to this equation, the price level is an average of all
prices in the economy and, therefore, a weighted average of all
the prices firms have set in the past.

The rate of arrival for

The faster price adjustment occurs, the less relevant

past pricing decisions are for the current price level.
Solving this model is a matter of straightforward algebra.
We obtain the following:

where πt=pt-pt-1 is the inflation rate.
Keynesian Phillips curve.

Thus, we obtain the new

Inflation today is a function of output

and inflation expected to prevail in the next period.

This model

has become the workhorse for much recent research on monetary
policy.

A Sticky-Information Model
This section proposes an alternative model of price dynamics.
In this model, every firm sets its price every period, but firms
gather information and recompute optimal prices slowly over time.
In each period, a fraction λ of firms obtains new information
about the state of the economy and computes a new path of optimal
prices.

Other firms continue to set prices based on old plans and

outdated information.

We make an assumption about information

arrival that is analogous to the adjustment assumption in the
Calvo model: Each firm has the same probability of being one of
the firms updating their pricing plans, regardless of how long it
has been since its last update.
As before, a firm's optimal price is
p*t = pt + αyt.

7

A firm that last updated its plans j periods ago sets the price
xjt = Et-jp*t.
The aggregate price level is the average of the prices of all
firms in the economy:

This

difference yields large differences in the dynamic pattern of
prices and output in response to monetary policy, as we see in the
next section.
One theoretical advantage of the sticky-information model is
that it survives the McCallum critique.

McCallum (1998) has

criticized the standard sticky-price model on the grounds that it
violates a strict form of the natural rate hypothesis, according
to which "there is no inflation policy--no money creation scheme-that will keep output high permanently."

Following Lucas (1972),

McCallum argues that "it seems a priori implausible that a nation

of
The

sticky-price model fails this test because a policy of permanently
falling inflation will keep output permanently high.

By contrast,

the sticky-information model satisfies this strict version of the
natural rate hypothesis.

Absent surprises, it must be the case

that pt=Et-jpt, which in turn implies yt=0.

Thus, the McCallum

critique favors the sticky-information Phillips curve over the
more commonly used alternative.

II. Inflation and Output Dynamics in the Sticky-Information Model

9

Having presented the sticky-information Phillips curve, we
now examine its dynamic properties.

To do this, we need to

complete the model with an equation for aggregate demand.

where β= [αλ2/(1-λ)] and the expectations are assumed to be formed

The second is a backward-looking model:
πt = βyt + πt-1.

2

There are other, perhaps more realistic, ways to add
aggregate demand to this model. One possibility would be to add
an IS equation together with an interest-rate policy rule for the
central bank. Such an approach is more complicated and involves
more free parameters. We believe the simpler approach taken here
best illustrates the key differences between the stickyinformation model and more conventional alternatives.

10

This backward-looking model resembles the equations estimated in
the empirical literature on the Phillips curve (as discussed in,
e.g., Gordon, 1996).

It can be viewed as the sticky-price model

together with the assumption of adaptive expectations: Etπt+1 = πt1.

thus, β=.0083).

Some of these parameters

We set α=.1 and λ=.25 (and,

This value of λ means that firms on average make

adjustments once a year.

The small value of α means that a firm's

desired relative price is not very sensitive to macroeconomic
conditions.

Note that the firm's desired nominal price can now be

written as
p*t = (1-α)pt + αmt.
If α is small, then each firm gives more weight to what other
firms are charging than to the level of aggregate demand.3
We now consider three hypothetical, policy experiments.
3

In

In the backward-looking model, the parameter β determines
the cost of disinflation. According to this model, if output falls
1 percent below potential for one quarter, then the inflation rate
falls by β if measured at a quarterly rate, or 4β if annualized.
If output falls by 1 percent below potential for one year, then
the annualized inflation rate falls by 16β. Thus, the sacrifice
ratio--the output loss associated with reducing inflation by one
percentage point--is 1/(16β). Our parameters put the sacrifice at
7.5.
For comparison, Okun's (1978) classic study estimated the
sacrifice ratio to be between 6 and 18 percent; Gordon (1997,
footnote 8) puts it at 6.4. Thus, our backward-looking model is
in the ballpark of similar models used the previous literature.

The details of the solution are presented in

Here we discuss the dynamic paths followed by

output and inflation.

Experiment 1: A Drop in the Level of Aggregate Demand
The first experiment we consider is a sudden and permanent
drop in the level of aggregate demand.

The demand variable mt is

constant and then, at time zero, unexpectedly falls by 10 percent
and remains at this new level.
The top graph in Figure 1 shows the path of output predicted
by each of the three models.

In all three models, the fall in

demand causes a recession, which gradually dissipates over time.

The other two models show

In the sticky-information model, the

maximum impact of the fall in demand on inflation occurs at 7

quarters.

Inflation could well be described as inertial.

Experiment 2: A Sudden Disinflation
The second experiment we consider is a sudden and permanent
shift in the rate of demand growth.

The demand variable mt is

assumed to grow at 10 percent per year (2.5 percent per period)
until time zero.

In period zero, the central bank sets mt the

same as it was in the previous period and, at the same time,
announces that mt will thereafter remain constant.

model,

inflation

Price setters, realizing that

disinflation is underway, immediately respond by making smaller
price adjustments.

Prices are sticky in the sticky-price model,

but inflation exhibits no inertia.

The response of output, of

course, is the other side of the coin.

Because inflation responds

instantly to the fall in money growth, output does not change.

As

in Phelps (1978), disinflation is costless.
By contrast, the sticky-information model predicts a gradual
reduction in inflation.

Even after the disinflationary policy is

in place, most price setters are still marking up prices based on
old decisions and outdated information.

As a result of this

inertial behavior, inflation is little changed one or two quarters
after the disinflation has begun.

With a constant money supply

and rising prices, the economy experiences a recession, which

13

reaches a trough 6 quarters after the policy change.

Output then

gradually recovers and is almost back to normal after 20 quarters.
These results seem roughly in line with what happens when nations
experience disinflation.4

Experiment 3: An Anticipated Disinflation
Now suppose that the disinflation in our previous experiment
is announced and credible two years (8 periods) in advance.

Let's

consider how this anticipated disinflation affects the path of
output and inflation.
Figure 3 shows output and inflation according to the three
models.

As

Christiano,

Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999) discuss, economists have a good sense

One way to

plausible responses to such shocks.

The Stochastic Process for the Money Supply
We model the growth in the demand variable m as following a
first-order autoregressive process: Δmt = ρΔmt-1 + εt.

In this

environment, the price level is nonstationary, but the inflation
rate is stationary.
To calibrate ρ, we looked at quarterly U.S. data from 1960 to
1999.

The positive value of ρ means that a monetary shock builds
over time.

That is, a positive shock ε causes m to jump up and

then to continue to rise.

With ρ=0.5, the level of m eventually

asymptotes to a plateau that is twice as high as the initial
shock.

This pattern for monetary shocks is broadly consistent

with that found in empirical studies.5

Startz (2001, p. 109), Hall and Taylor (1993, p. 217), and Stock
and Watson (1999, p. 48).

Panel B of Table 2 shows the correlation predicted by the
models.

Not surprisingly, the backward-looking model predicts a

high correlation.

Because πt - πt-1 = βyt in this model, the

correlation is perfect for the one-period change in inflation and
only slightly lower for longer changes.

In essence, the model

builds in the acceleration phenomenon through the assumption of
adaptive

expectations.

This

victory: The appeal of the backward-looking model comes not from
its theoretical underpinnings but from its ability to fit this
phenomenon.
We next look at the two models with better foundations.
Table 2 shows that the sticky-price model yields no association
between output and the change in inflation.

For the one-year

change, the correlation between these variables is -0.13, which is
small and the wrong sign.

By contrast, the sticky-information

model yields a strong, positive association.

Our finding that the calibrated sticky-price model predicts
a negative correlation between y and Δπ (in contrast to the

These simulated correlations are computed under the
assumption that all fluctuations are due to demand shocks. If we
were to append supply shocks to this model, the predicted
correlations would be driven down, because such shocks push
inflation and output in opposite directions. Thus, supply shocks
would make it even harder for the sticky-price model to match the
positive correlation in the data.

obvious inefficiencies they cause.

Thus, sticky information offers a more compelling rationale for
this type of nominal rigidity.
Moving the theory of price adjustment away from sticky prices
toward sticky information may seem like a radical suggestion, but
we temper it with an important observation: Many lessons from the
"new Keynesian" literature on price adjustment apply as well to
our sticky-information model as they do to the standard stickyprice model.
An early lesson about price adjustment by firms with some
degree of monopoly power is that the private losses from sticky
prices are only second order, even if the social losses are first
order.

(Mankiw, 1985; Akerlof and Yellen, 1985).

By contrast, if firms

then it is natural to assume that their adjustment process is
time-contingent.

Price setters cannot react between scheduled

adjustments, because they are not collecting the information and
performing the calculations necessary for that purpose.
Finally, we offer one piece of microeconomic evidence.

Appendix: Details of solutions
This appendix explains the solutions of the three models
presented in the text.

I. The derivation of the sticky-price Phillips curve
From the equations for the adjustment price xt and the price
level

pt,

breaking

the

sum

and

using

the

law

of

iterated

expectations, we obtain:
(A1)

xt = λ p*t + (1-λ) Etxt+1,

(A2)

pt = λ xt + (1-λ) pt-1.

But then solving for xt in (A2) and replacing in (A1) for xt and
xt+1, together with the definition of p*t = pt + αyt, yields the
desired expression for inflation presented in the text.

II. The derivation of the sticky-information Phillips curve
Begin with the equation for the price level derived in the
text:
(A3)

pt = λ

∞
Σ (1-λ)j Et-j(pt + αyt).
j=0

By taking out the first term and redefining the summation index,
this equation can be written as:
(A4)

∞
pt = λ(pt + αyt)+ λ Σ (1-λ)j+1 Et-1-j(pt + αyt).
j=0

Analogous to equation (A3), the previous period's price level can
be written as:

30

∞
pt-1 = λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(pt-1 + αyt-1).
j=0

(A5)

Subtracting (A5) from (A4) and rearranging yields the following
equation for the inflation rate:
∞
πt = λ(pt + αyt)+ λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(πt + αgt)
j=0

(A6)

∞
- λ2 Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(pt + αyt).
j=0
Now equation (A4) can be rearranged to show that:
(A7)

pt

∞
- [αλ/(1-λ)]yt = λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(pt + αyt).
j=0

We now use equation (A7) to substitute for the last term in
equation (A6).
(A8)

After rearranging, we obtain
∞
πt = [αλ/(1-λ)]yt + λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(πt + αgt).
j=0

This is the sticky-information Phillips curve presented in the
text.

III. The response of output and inflation in the three policy
experiments
The three policy experiments we undertake can be described as
follows:
(E1) An unexpected fall in the level of aggregate demand by
10% at date 0.

Thus, mt=-log(0.9) for t<0 and mt=0 for t≥0.

31

(E2) An unexpected drop in the rate of money growth _mt at
date 0, from 2.5% per period to 0%.

Thus, mt=0.025(1+t) for

t≤-1, mt=0 for t≥0.
(E3) Same as (E2) but announced at date t=-8.
We focus on finding solutions for pt as a function of mt.

The

solution for yt then follows from the aggregate demand equation.
For

is

follows
used

to

substitute out for y:
pt(1+β) = 2pt-1 - pt-2 + βmt.

(A9)

This is a second-order difference equation.

The associated roots

are [1±(-β)1/2]/(1+β), which are complex (since β>0), generating
the oscillatory behavior.
For the sticky-price model, rewrite the Phillips curve, using
the aggregate demand equation, as:
Etpt+1 - (2 + β)pt + pt-1 = -βmt.

(A10)

This is an expectational difference equation, which can be solved
by

the

methods

explained

in

Sargent

(1986).

First,

take

expectations at t and express all expectations at t variables with
*. Then using the lag operator L, such that LEtpt=Etpt-1 and its
inverse,

the

forward

operator,

F=L-1

such

that

FEtpt=Etpt+1,

reexpress (A5) as:
(A11)

(F2 - (2 + β)F + 1)Lpt* = -βmt*.

The quadratic (x2 - (2 + β)x + 1), has two positive roots: θ and
1/θ, such that (1-θ)2/θ = β. Pick θ to correspond to the smaller

32

of the roots. Then (A11) becomes:
(1 - θL) pt* = (1 - θ)2 (1 - Fθ)-1 mt*.

(A12)

But using the fact that θ < 1, the inverse on the right-hand side
is well defined and can be expanded. Finally, since pt and pt-1 are
part of date t information set, we obtain the final solution:
∞
pt = θ pt-1 + (1-θ)2 Σ θi Etmt+i.
i=0

(A13)

For the policy experiment E1, up to date 0, pt=mt=-log(0.9).
From 0 onwards, Etmt+i=mt+i=0, so the price level is given by the
recursion pt=θpt-1 with initial condition p-1=-log(0.9). For E2,
pt=mt until t=-1, and after again pt=θpt-1, but now the initial
condition is p-1=0. Thus pt=0, t≥0 and so yt=0 at all t. For E3, in
the period -8≤t≤-1, then the terms of the sum in the right hand
side of (A13) are Etmt+i=0.025(1+t) for -8≤t+i≤-1 and Etmt+i=0 for
t+i≥0. After that, for t≥0, pt=θpt-1.
Finally, consider the sticky-information model, as captured
by the equation:
∞
pt = λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-j[(1-α)pt + αmt)].
j=0

(A14)

The

components, where the first includes price setters aware of the

As a result, the

second term reduces to -log(0.9)(1-λ)t+1. The agents represented by
the first term are responded to the new path of aggregate demand,
so Et-jmt = 0, and since we are solving for the perfect-foresight
equilibrium,

Et-jpt

=

pt.

Collecting

terms

and

rearranging,

we

obtain the solution:
pt = [-log(0.9)(1-λ)t+1]/[1-(1-α)(1-(1-λ)t+1)].

(A16)

This equation gives the solution for the price level in stickyinformation model under policy experiment E1.
We can find the outcome under policy experiment E2 with
similar steps.

(A17)

Under E2, however, Et-jpt = Et-jmt = 0.025(1+t) for

Thus, the solution is:
pt = [0.025(1+t)(1-λ)t+1]/[1-(1-α)(1-(1-λ)t+1)].

This equation gives the price level in the sticky-information
model under policy experiment E2.
Finally, for E3, for t<0, the path is the same as expected by
all agents, so pt=mt=0.025(t+1) and yt=0. After date 0, pt is given
by (note the limit of the sums):
t+8
∞
(A18) pt = λ Σ(1-λ)jEt-j[(1-α)pt+αmt)] + λ Σ(1-λ)jEt-j[(1-α)pt+αmt)].
j=0
j=t+9

34

All else is the same as in E2.

The solution follows as:

(A19) pt = [0.025(1+t)(1-λ)t+9]/[1-(1-α)(1-(1 - λ)t+9)].
This equation gives the path of the price level for the stickyinformation model under policy experiment E3.

Consider first the backward-looking model. First-differencing
both sides of (A9), multiplying through by (1-ρL) and rearranging
yields the following AR(3) for the inflation rate:
(A21)

πt = [1+β]-1 {[2+ρ(1+β)]πt-1 - (2ρ+1)πt-2 + ρπt-3 + βεt}.

From this equation, we can calculate impulse responses and all
moments of inflation.
Consider now the sticky-price model. We find the general
solution of these rational expectation models by the method of
undetermined coefficients as outlined in Taylor (1985). Since the
money growth rate is stationary, it is a reasonable conjecture
that the inflation rate is also stationary and so can be expressed
in the MA(∞) general form:
∞
(A22)
πt = Σ φj εt-j
j=0

or

35

∞

pt = Σ
Σ φj εt-j-k
k=0 j=0

where the φj are coefficients to be determined. Then realize that
Et{εt+i-j-k}=εt+i-j-k for i-j≤k and is zero otherwise.

Using the

of the model in (A12):

Σ φj εt-j-k= θΣ Σ φj εt-1-j-k +(1-θ)2 Σ θi Σ
Σ ρj εt+i-j-k.
j=0
k=0 j=0
i=0 j=0 k=Max{i-j,0}

But then, since this must hold for all possible realizations of
εt-j, matching coefficients on both sides of this equation yields
for the coefficient on εt:
i
∞
(A24)
φ0 = (1-θ)2 Σ θi Σ ρj
i=0 j=0

=

(1-θ)/(1-θρ).

And for a general v, the coefficient on εt-v:
v
v-1
i+v
∞
(A25)
Σ φj = θ Σ φj + (1-θ)2 Σ θi Σ ρj.
j=0
j=0
i=0 j=0
This yields:
v-1
(A26) φv = (θ-1) Σ φj + [(1-θ)2/(1-ρ)][1/(1-θ) - ρv+1/(1-θρ)].
j=0
Equations (A22), (A24) and (A26) fully describe the stochastic
process of inflation. The impulse response of inflation for a unit
shock to aggregate demand is given by {φv}. The autocorrelation
coefficients of order j are then given by (see Hamilton, 1994, p.
52):

Σ φv φv-j / Σ φv2.

v=0

Consider

now

the

sticky-information

36

model.

Similarly

to

(A22), conjecture the solution: πt = Σ γi εt-i or pt = Σ Σ γi εt-i-k,

This provides the full characterization of the stochastic process
for inflation.

For this, impulse responses, autocorrelations, and

cross-correlations can be easily calculated.

V. Impulse responses of output and population correlations between
output and the change in inflation.
For the backward-looking model, corr(πt+2-πt-2,yt)=corr[πt+2-πt2,(πt-πt-1)/β],

which we can evaluate using (A21).

Corr(πt+4-πt-4,yt)

follows likewise.
For the sticky-price model, note that output growth is given
from the quantity theory: Δyt = Δmt - πt = Σ (ρj-φj) εt-j.

From

this, we can obtain the MA(∞) for output: yt = Σ ωjεt-j with the
recursion ωj = ωj-1 + ρj-φj, initiated by ω0 = 1 - φ0. The impulse

37

response to a unit shock is given by the sequence {ωv}.

To solve

for the change in inflation πt+4-πt, start with πt = Σ φj εt-j; the
coefficients

in

the

MA(∞)

representation

for

the

change

in

inflation πt+4-πt = Σ ξjεt-j are then given by ξj = φj - φj-4 with ξ0
= φ0, ξ1 = φ1, ξ2 = φ2, and ξ3 = φ3.

Given these results, the

population cross-correlation between the change in inflation and
output, corr(πt+2-πt-2,yt), is:
∞
∞
Σ φv ξv / (Σ φv2)(Σ ξv+22).
v=0
v=0

(A31)

The

cross-correlation

corr(πt+4-πt-4,yt)

is

derived

in

the

same

fashion.
The derivation of the population cross-correlations in the
sticky-information model is precisely the same, except we start
with πt = Σ γi εt-i as the process for inflation.
