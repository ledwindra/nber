    "abstract": "\n\nArmed groups routinely delegate domains of rule to village customary chiefs\u2014indirect rule. The larger a chief\u2019s power over the villagers relative to the group\u2019s, the more there is indirect rule. Over time, enabled by the chief\u2019s efforts to legitimize the group, the group expands the taxes they collect themselves in addition to those collected by the chief for them and substitutes the chief for justice administration\u2014converging to direct rule. This suggests indirect rule is a temporary arrangement by uninformed or illegitimate rulers with an inherent agency problem, overcome when rulers acquire enough skill to replace pre-existing political authorities.\n\n",

We thank Aimable Amani Lameke, Paulin Bazuzi, Freddy Koleramungu, Desire Cizungu Basibuhe and Sim\u00b4eon Lukeno for their exceptional work on this project. We thank Darren Hawkins, Jonathan Homola, Connor Huff, Torben Iversen, Horacio Larreguy, Nathan Nunn, Pia Raffler, Otis Reid, and Mike Ting for helpful comments, discussion, and suggestions. We also thank the participants of the 2022 UNU-Wider workshop on Institutional Legacies of Violent Conflict in Helsinki for comments and suggestions. The paper also benefited from presentations at APSA, FTCP, Harvard, and MPSA. David Ifkovits, Matt Pecenco, and Carlos Schmidt-Padilla provided excellent research assistance. Adama Kabore, Anne-Laure van der Wielen, and Marakuja Kivu Research provided excellent management for this project\u2019s operations. We are especially thankful to Mick Moore, Wilson Prichard, and Patricia Justino for their continuous support, and to Adam Random for tireless administrative support. The study received ethics review and approval from Columbia University (IRB-AAAK0552), Harvard University (IRB14-4223), and The University of California Berkeley (2016-06-8849). All errors are our own. Collecting data in contexts of violence raises important security, safety, and ethical questions (Marchais, Bazuzi and Amani Lameke, 2020, Shesterinina, 2019, Wood, 2006), which we discuss in Annex B. Special provisions were taken to reduce risks to researchers and participants. The project was reviewed and approved by Congolese administrative authorities at the provincial, territory, and village levels. Security and communication protocols were systematically implemented. In addition to direct exposure to risk, interviews which cover sensitive events, and particularly violent events, can trigger traumatic memories among research participants. In addition to the procedure of informed consent that preceded all interviews, there were additional consent forms preceding the most sensitive sections. The research team had considerable experience and their expertise was crucial to ensure that respondents felt safe to discuss sensitive issues.
