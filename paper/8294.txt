Introduction

Do bidders in auction markets behave as predicted by game theoretic models? In an
environment with common values, this question is often rephrased by asking whether
bidders account for the winner’s curse. It has frequently been addressed in the literature by checking the reduced form prediction that bidders may bid less aggressively
against more rivals. In a common value environment, the tendency to bid more aggressively under more competition is tempered by winner’s curse considerations. Winning
the auction is bad news to the extent that it reveals that the winning bidder’s signal
was more optimistic than that of the other bidders, and the greater the level of competition the worse the news associated with winning. However, Pinkse and Tan [24]
show that this feature of bidding is not specific to the common value environment,
in that equilibrium bids may also fall as competition increases in private affiliated
value models. If an ex post measure of the value of the object being sold is available,
an alternative research strategy is to compare bid levels to the value measure. Our
previous work [10],[11] exploits the availability of ex post values to test equilibrium
bidding models in common value environments with asymmetric information using
drainage tract data. Drainage tracts are adjacent to tracts where oil and gas deposits
have been found. The firms owning the adjacent tracts, called “neighbor” firms, have
superior information to non-neighbors about tract value. The key feature of competitive bidding between informed and uninformed firms in first-price, common value
auctions is that the latter participate, but their number is essentially irrelevant to the
informed firm. Since neighbor firms could be identified, and because they behaved as
a consortium, it was possible to test the theory by comparing the bidding behavior
and the ex post profits of neighbor firms and nonneighbors.
In this paper we study bidding in first-price, sealed bid auctions with symmetric
information using wildcat tract data. Wells drilled in search of new deposits of oil and
gas are called wildcat wells. Wildcat tracts are located in areas that have not been
drilled. Firms are allowed to conduct seismic studies prior to bidding for these tracts,
but they are not permitted to drill exploratory wells. The seismic studies yield noisy
signals about the value of the tract. Thus, firms are more or less equally informed,
although they may have quite different opinions about the likelihood of finding oil
and gas, depending upon the content and analyses of the surveys. Our primary
objective is the same as in our study of drainage auctions: is bidding in wildcat
auctions consistent with equilibrium behavior? We use the availability of data on
ex post realizations of common tract value to develop several preliminary tests to
determine whether firms are cognizant of the winner’s curse. The tests compare bids
against outcomes and most of them are not rejected. However, developing formal tests
of equilibrium bidding in symmetric, common value auctions with entry requires a
different approach than in asymmetric, common value auctions.
2

Our main test for equilibrium bidding exploits the recent work by Laffont and
Vuong [16] on structural estimation in first-price auctions. Applying a clever transformation of variables to the bidder’s first order condition for optimality, they show
that the bidder’s valuation of the object can be expressed as a function of its bid
and the distribution of the maximum rival bid. In private value environments, this
valuation is the firm’s expected value of the object conditional on its signal. As a
result, the first order conditions can be used to nonparametrically identify the joint
distribution of bidder valuations (after suitably normalizing the signals) as well as the
firm’s bid function. In common value environments, the first order condition identifies the firm’s expected value of the object conditional on its signal being equal to
the maximum signal of its rivals. Because this valuation depends on rivals’ signals, it
cannot be used to identify the firm’s signal, and hence its bid function or the underlying distributions of signals. However, the conditional expectation can be estimated if
data on bids and ex post realizations of the common tract value are available. Thus,
instead of inferring this value from the first order condition, it is possible to test
the condition directly. An important feature of the test is that it is not sensitive to
unobserved tract heterogeneity. Because the bidder’s first order condition must hold
for each realization of tract characteristics, it must also hold in the aggregate.
Standard models of bidding take the number of bidders as fixed and known to the
participants. In the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) auctions, it is the number of firms
that conduct or purchase seismic surveys that matters. If there is a binding reserve
price, then not all participants necessarily bid. Consequently, the actual number of
bidders may not be a good proxy for the level of competition. Furthermore, the
number of firms that obtain seismic signals may not be known to the bidders since
not all potential bidders choose to invest in surveys. Participation rates are typically
less than 25 per cent in any given sale for any firm. We construct a measure of the
set of potential bidders for a tract that is constructed from information on who bid in
the local area. The assumption is that if a firm is interested in the area, then it will
obtain a seismic survey covering some of the tracts in that area and bid on at least
one tract. We condition our test of equilibrium bidding in a symmetric common value
environment on this measure of competition. We find that the test is not rejected
on the more competitive tracts. On the less competitive tracts, there is evidence of
overbidding due to firms overestimating tract values. A model in which firms ignore
the information from winning is rejected by the data.
The common value hypothesis has been criticized in the work of Li, Perrigne and
Vuong [18], who adopt the alternative assumption that the bidding environment is
private values. The two different valuation models can have quite different positive
implications, such as the effect of increased competition. The model of valuations
also affects normative issues, such as optimal auction design. Despite the important
theoretical distinction between common and private valuation models, the empirical
3

literature has struggled with the problem of distinguishing between them. Laffont and
Vuong [16] show that, conditional on the number of potential bidders, bidding data
alone are insufficient to distinguish nonparametrically between a common value model
and an affiliated private values model. One approach for distinguishing between the
two environments is to exploit exogenous variation in the number of bidders. The
bidder valuation identified by the first order condition is independent of the number
of potential bidders under the hypothesis of private values and is stochastically increasing under the hypothesis of common values. Haile, Hong and Shum [8] provide
a test based on this approach. The difficulty with applying this test to our data is
unobserved heterogeneity. That is, consistent with our model of entry, the number
of potential and actual bidders are correlated with tract value. We propose a test
that exploits the availability of data on ex post values. We use this information to
compute bid markups and rents under the alternative hypotheses of common and
private values. The results suggest that the OCS data are more consistent with the
common value model, and inconsistent with a private values model.
We also propose a strategy for identifying common value models when data on
ex post values are available. Our strategy consists of imposing a moment restriction
on the joint distribution of a bidder’s signal and the common value. In particular,
we assume that bidders’ posterior estimates of the common value are unbiased. This
restriction is sufficient to identify the inverse bid function, which we estimate separately on the more competitive and less competitive tracts. Our approach to resolving
the non-identification problem in common value auctions does not assume rational
bidding. That is, in contrast to other papers on structural estimation in auctions,
our method is not based upon the bidders’ first order conditions.
The literature on structural estimation of auction models has focussed primarily
on the private value environment. The early work by Smiley [26], Paarsch [23], and
Donald and Paarsch [5] take a parametric approach, restricting the class of joint
distributions to those which admit a closed form solution for the bid function, and
then using maximum likelihood methods to estimate the unknown parameter vector.
Laffont, Ossard and Vuong [15] develop a simulated nonlinear least squares estimator
which exploits the fact that, in the symmetric independent private values (IPV)
environment, the bid function can be expressed as a conditional expectation of a
second-order statistic. Elyakime, Laffont, Loisel and Vuong [6] derive a nonparametric
estimation method for estimating the bidder’s inverse bid function, which has a closed
form solution in an IPV value environment. Li, Perrigne and Vuong [18] extend
the nonparametric method to conditionally independent private values environments
(CIPV). Li, Perrigne and Vuong [17] also show how to extend this method to affiliated
private values (APV) environments. Bajari [1] uses Bayesian likelihood methods in an
IPV model with asymmetric bidders. Hong and Shum [12] and Bajari and Hortacsu [3]
estimate structural models of common value (CV) auctions by assuming a parametric
4

form for the joint distribution of signals and common value.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the theoretical model. In
Section 3 we describe how the federal government sells rights to oil and gas properties
on offshore lands and present the data. Section 4 provides evidence that bidders bid
rationally. We classify tracts into two sets, a highly competitive set in which the
number of potential bidders is larger than six and a less competitive set in which the
number of potential bidders does not exceed six. For each category, we examine the
relationship between ex post returns and bids and provide a measure of the winner’s
curse. The results indicate that bidders bid less than their expectation of the value
of the tract and less aggressively on the more competitive set of tracts. In Section
5 we develop and implement a test of equilibrium bidding in CV environment. In
Section 6 we estimate the bid function. In Section 7 we discuss the common value
assumption. Concluding remarks are contained in Section 8.

The Model

We adopt the convention of denoting parameters in lower case, random variables in
upper case, and realizations of random variables in lower case.
Consider a first-price, sealed bid auction in which l potential bidders compete for
the production rights of a single tract. The announced minimum bid is r. Prior to
bidding, each potential bidder must decide whether to become more informed about
the tract by investing in a seismic survey. A potential bidder who does not invest
in a survey does not bid. Those who invest in a survey are called active bidders.
Each active bidder must then decide whether and how much to bid conditional on
the seismic information obtained. If the information is not favorable, then an active
bidder may believe that the tract is not worth r and hence choose not to bid. An
active bidder who decides to bid is called an actual bidder. Thus, a potential bidder is
observed to bid if and only if it believes that the prospect of finding oil is sufficiently
high to justify a costly survey, and those beliefs are confirmed by the survey.
Let V denote the unknown, common value of the oil and gas deposit. Let Zi denote
a potential bidder i’s private estimate of the value of the tract prior to investing in
a seismic survey. The seismic survey provides an active bidder i with a private, realvalued information signal Si that is drawn from a distribution with support [s, s].
The random variables (V, Z1 , ..., Zl ) are affiliated which, loosely speaking, implies
that higher realizations of some of the components make higher realizations of the
remaining components more likely. The joint distribution of (V, Z1 , ..., Zl ) is assumed
to be exchangeable with respect to bidder indices. A potential bidder invests in a
survey if its estimate exceeds a common threshold level. Thus, the number of active
bidders, N, is a random variable that is affiliated with V . Let K = N − 1 denote the
5

number of rivals of an active bidder. The random variables (V, S1 , ..., Sl ) are assumed
to be strictly affiliated and exchangeable with respect to the bidder indices.
The assumptions of affiliation and exchangeability are standard for models with
an exogenous number of bidders. However, in our model, participation is endogenous
and potentially informative. We will need to impose two additional restrictions.
Information Assumptions: (i) (Z1 , ...Zl ) are independent conditional on V 1 , and
(ii) V and Zi are independent conditional on Si .
The purpose of the information assumptions is to make pre-seismic information redundant for active bidders. They imply that Sj and K are independent of Zi conditional
on Si for i 6= j.2 Thus, the beliefs of an active bidder about the value of the tract,
the number of active rivals, and rival signals do not depend upon private information
that it may have held prior to acquiring the seismic information. In addition, private
information held by potential bidders who do not become active is not relevant to
an active bidder’s assessment of the tract. Thus, there is no selection problem in
restricting the set of players in the bidding game to active bidders.
The value of the tract to an active bidder i is given by Ui = u(V, Si ) where u is
non-negative, continuous and increasing in both arguments. All of the bidder utilities
depend upon the common component in the same manner and, for the moment, each
bidder’s utility is also allowed to depend upon its own seismic signal. Note that it
is restrictive to assume that the signal Si is a scalar, as opposed to a vector. In a
more general environment, bidders might have private information about the common
component of value, V , as well as private components of value.
Let F denote the cumulative distribution function of the l+2 vector (N, V, S1 , ..., Sl ).
If n < l, then the distribution function of the n + 1 vector (V, S1 , ..., Sn ) is derived
from F by conditioning on N = n and setting Sn+j = s for j = 1, ..., l − n. The n + 1
vector is assumed to have a density f . The distribution function F and the utility
function u are common knowledge. Each active bidder i knows the value of his signal
si but does not know the signals of the other active bidders. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that the decision to acquire detailed survey information is private,3 in which
case the number of active bidders is not known to the bidders. For the purposes of
this paper, we can be agnostic on this issue.
Our model is similar to that of McAfee and Vincent [21], who extend the model
referred to by Laffont and Vuong [16] as the Affiliated Value (AV) model to the case
1

Conditional independence is a consequence of the exchangeability of an unbounded number of
random variables and thus, for l large, is a reasonable restriction on the joint distribution.
2
An example that satisfies the Information Assumptions is one in which Si = V + εi and Zi =
Si + η i , where εi and η i are indiosyncratic shocks.
3
For example, some of the potential bidders may purchase geological survey information from
corporations that specialize in such activities. Other bidders, such as Shell, typically conduct their
own surveys.

of a stochastic number of bidders. The AV model was first introduced by Wilson
[29] and is a special case of the general symmetric model of Milgrom and Weber [22].
In the AV model, the signals of other bidders affect the expected utility of bidder i
through their affiliation with V , but they do not enter as arguments of the utility
function. Two special cases will be of interest. The model is said to be a Common
Value (CV) model when Ui = V ; it is called an Affiliated Private Value (APV) model
when Ui = Si .
In deriving the equilibrium, we take the perspective of bidder 1. But before specifying his optimization problem, we require some notation. Let p(s) = (p1 (s), .., pk (s), ..pl (s))
where pk (s) denotes the probability that bidder 1 faces k rival bidders given signal
s. Define Y1 as the maximum signal among bidder 1’s rivals conditional on the event
that bidder 1 has at least one active rival, and zero when bidder 1 has no rivals.
Let HY1 |S1 (·|s) denote the cumulative distribution of Y1 when bidder 1 has obtained
signal s and has at least one rival bidder. Let hY1 |S1 (·|s) denote the associated density
function. Then,
l−1
X

HY1 |S1 (y|s) =
FY |S ,K (y|s, k).
1 − p0 (s) 1 1
k=1
Note that the probability weights have been normalized to sum to 1 by conditioning
on the event that bidder 1 has at least one active rival. Define
w(s, y) = E[u(V, s)|S1 = s, Y1 = y, K ≥ 1]
to be bidder 1’s expected value from the tract when his signal is s and the maximum
of his rivals’ signals (assuming k ≥ 1) is y. When bidder 1 has no active rivals, his
expected value is given by
w(s) = E[u(V, s)|S1 = s].
Affiliation imposes considerable structure on bidder 1’s beliefs about K and Y1 ,
and his expected value. We gather the important results in the lemma below. Note
that, conditional on K ≥ 1, Y1 is affiliated with S1 since it is the maximum of a finite,
positive number of random variables that are affiliated with S1 .
Lemma 1 (i) p(s) first order stochastically dominates p(s0 ) for s0 > s, (ii)
is decreasing in s, (iii) w(s) and w(s, y) are increasing functions.

HY1 |S1 (y|s)
hY1 |S1 (y|s)

The proof of Lemma 1 follows standard arguments in the literature and is not repeated
here.

7

Suppose that each rival adopts the monotone increasing bidding strategy β(s)
with inverse η(b). Under the assumption of risk neutrality, bidder 1’s optimization
problem consists of choosing b ≥ r to maximize
Π(b, s) = (1 − p0 (s))

s (r) = inf s : (1 − p0 (s))E[w(s, Y1 )|S1 = s, Y1 < s] + p0 (s)w(s) ≥ r
to be the lowest signal at which a bidder believes the value of the tract conditional on
winning (in a symmetric equilibrium) is worth at least the reserve price. We assume
that s∗ (r) exists4 and exceeds s, the lower bound of the support of Si . Hence, the
reserve price is binding, and the boundary condition for solving the above differential
equation is β(s∗ ) = r. We define β(s) = 0 for s < s∗ .
McAfee, Quan, and Vincent [20] have observed that affiliation of (V, S1 , .., Sl ) is
not sufficient to ensure existence of an equilibrium in increasing bid functions when
the number of bidders is stochastic. The problem is that the event of bidding against
zero rivals (i.e., no maximum rival signal) and the event of bidding against one or
more rivals are not ordered.5 When N is affiliated with Si and the reserve price is
binding, the condition required for monotonicity is more likely to hold, and we shall
assume that this is the case for oil lease auctions.
4

If N is independent of V , then Lemma 1 is sufficient for existence since p0 is a constant.
A straightforward application of Milgrom and Weber’s proof for existence (Theorem 14) requires
one to show that the term

has the same sign as (s − x). Lemma 1 is sufficient if p0 is zero but it is not otherwise.

8

The important insight offered in Elyakime, Laffont, Loisel and Vuong [6] is that,
for empirical purposes, it is more useful to invert the above equilibrium relation and
express the signal as a function of the bid and the distribution of bids. Define M1
to be the highest bid submitted by bidder 1’s rivals or, in the absence of a rival bid,
the reserve price. Note that the latter event can occur in two ways: either bidder 1
has no rivals or all of bidder 1’s rivals have signals less than s∗ . The two events are
not distinguishable empirically, which is why it is important to define M1 as we have
rather than as the maximum bid of bidder 1’s rivals. The latter random variable is
not observable if r is binding. Let the conditional distribution of M1 given B1 , the
bid of the firm in question, be denoted by GM1 |B1 (·|·) and its density by gM1 |B1 (·|·).
Note that monotonicity of β and η implies, for any b > r,
GM1 |B1 (m|b) = [1 − p0 (η(b))]HY1 |S1 (η(m)|η(b)) + p0 (η(b)).
The first term is the probability that the highest bid among bidder 1’s rivals is less
than m conditional upon bidder 1’s bid of b and the event of at least one rival; the
second term is the probability that bidder 1 has no rival. Note that {M = r} occurs
with positive probability, so r is a point of discontinuity for GM1 |B1 . It is continuous
and differentiable on (r, ∞) with density function
gM1 |B1 (m|b) =

(1 − p0 (η(b)))hY1 |S1 (η(m)|η(b))
.
β 0 (η(b))

Substituting the above relations into equation (3) yields, for b > r,
w(η(b), η(b)) = b +

GM1 |B1 (b|b)
≡ ξ(b, G).
gM1 |B1 (b|b)

(4)

In a series of papers, Vuong and his coauthors have used equation (4) to develop
nonparametric estimators for F and β in private value environments. Recall that
when valuations are private, w(s, s) = s, and ξ can be interpreted as the inverse
bid function. Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong [7] consider the independent private value
environment, Li, Perrigne, and Vuong [17] consider affiliated private values, and Li,
Perrigne, and Vuong [18] conditionally independent private values. The assumption
of private values is crucial. Laffont and Vuong have shown that it is not possible
to use equation (4) to identify F or β in common value environments, at least not
without making strong parametric assumptions about u and F.
We are interested primarily in testing equilibrium bidding behavior. The first test
was developed by Laffont and Vuong for private affiliated value environments but is
easily extended to environments with a common component and a stochastic number
of bidders. Lemma 1 implies that w(s, s) is increasing in s. Therefore, if equation (4)
9

holds, then ξ(b, G) must be monotone increasing in b. If it is not, the data generating
mechanism is not a symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium in monotone increasing bid
functions. This test is essentially a joint test of affiliation, symmetry and equilibrium.
Our second test is novel but specific to environments that satisfy the following
assumption.
Preference Assumption: u(V, Si ) = V.
Given the above assumption,
w(s, s) = E[V |S1 = s, Y1 = s].
Define the conditional expectation function,
ζ(b) = E[V |B1 = b, M1 = b].
In principle, ζ can be estimated if, in addition to bids, data on the realizations of the
common value V are available, as is the case in our data set on oil and gas auctions.
Monotonicity of β implies that for b > r,
ζ(b) = w(η(b), η(b)).
At b = r, the definition of M1 implies that
ζ(r) = (1 − p0 (s∗ ))E[V |S1 = s∗ , Y1 < s∗ ] + p0 (s∗ )E[V |S1 = s∗ ] = r < w(s∗ , s∗ ).
In other words, ζ exhibits a downward discontinuity at r due to the possibility of
no rival bid. But, for b > r, if bidding is according to a symmetric Bayesian Nash
equilibrium, then
ζ(b) = ξ(b, G).
(5)
Equation (5) is an empirically testable implication of equilibrium bidding in the common value environment.
We also test a variation on our model in which firms choose bids to maximize the
expression given in equation (1) but where w(s) replaces w(s, y) in the integrand. We
will refer to this model as the myopic bidding model. An interpretation is that, in
choosing its bid, each firm’s beliefs about the probability of winning are consistent
with the true probability law but its beliefs about the value of the tract conditional
on winning are not. In particular, its expectations are based solely on its own signal,
and it ignores the “bad news” associated with the event of winning. Deriving the
first-order conditions and applying the same transformation of variables as above
yields the first-order condition
w(η(b)) = ξ(b, G).
10

Define γ(b) = E[V |B1 = b]. As in the case of ζ, the function γ can be estimated
from the data on bids and realizations of the common value V. Monotonicity of the
bid function then implies that γ(b) = w(η(b)). Consequently, one can test the myopic
bidding model by testing the equality
γ(b) = ξ(b, G).
Note that this equality must hold for b ≥ r, since the participation rule in the myopic
model is to bid as long as w(s) exceeds r.

Auction Mechanism and Data

The U.S. government holds the mineral rights to offshore lands more than three miles
from the coast, out to the 200 mile limit. The states own the rights out to the three
mile mark. Beginning in 1954, the federal government has transferred production
rights on its lands to the private sector by a succession of lease sales in which hundreds
of leases have been auctioned. A wildcat lease sale is initiated when the Department
of Interior (DOI) announces that certain offshore areas are available for exploration,
and nominations are invited as to which tracts should be offered for sale. A tract
is typically a block of 5,000 or 5,760 acres, or half a block. The number of tracts
available in a sale is usually well over one hundred and tracts are often scattered over
several different areas.
Prior to the sale, and often prior to the announcement of the sale, firms conduct
seismic surveys on selected tracts. The time between announcement and sale date
is at most several months, since DOI is required to give only thirty days notice. A
survey provides information about the geology of the tracts and is used by a firm to
determine which tracts to bid and how much to bid. The cost of a detailed survey has
been reported to vary between $9 to $26 per acre, including payments to the geologists
to study and interpret the seismic data. Some firms conduct their own surveys while
others purchase surveys from geophysical firms that specialize in this type of activity.
Many aspects of the firm’s tract evaluations are private, including which tracts were
selected for investigation. In particular, given the cost of a tract survey, it is not
an equilibrium for all firms known to be interested in acquiring leases in an area to
survey all tracts. Individual firms typically select a fraction of the available tracts
and the locations of these tracts are reputedly a closely guarded secret.
A firm can choose either to bid solo or jointly with other firms. A joint bid
in offshore auctions consists of two or more firms combining to submit a single bid
and sharing the costs and revenues if their bid is the high bid. Prior to 1975, this
practice was legal for all firms. In late 1975, DOI adopted regulations barring the
eight largest crude oil producers worldwide (Exxon, Gulf, Mobil, Shell, Standard Oil
11

of California, Standard Oil of Indiana, Texaco and British Petroleum) from bidding
with each other on the grounds that the practice was reducing prices. Joint bidding
groups are frequently sale-specific and form after the announcement of the sale.
The nominated tracts in a sale are sold simultaneously in a first-price, sealed bid
auction. The announced reserve price for tracts in our sample is $15 per acre. A
participating bidder or consortium of bidders submits a separate bid on each tract
that it has an interest in acquiring. A bid is a dollar figure, known as a bonus. At
the sale date, DOI opens the envelopes and announces the value of the bids that
have been submitted on each tract and the identities of the bidders. The firm or
consortium that submits the highest bid on a tract is usually awarded the tract at a
price equal to its bid. In practice, the government could and did reject bids above
the stated minimum price. The rejection rate was less than 10% on wildcat tracts
and usually occurred on marginal tracts receiving only one bid (Porter [25]). We will
largely ignore this factor in our analysis.
When a firm or consortium is awarded a tract, it has 5 years to explore it. If no
work is done during the lease term (i.e., no wells are drilled), ownership reverts to the
government and the tract may subsequently be re-offered. A nominal fee, typically $3
per acre, is paid each year until either the lease is relinquished or production begins.
If oil or gas is discovered in sufficient quantities, the lease is automatically renewed as
long as production occurs. A fixed fraction of the revenues from extraction accrues
to the government as royalty payments. The royalty rate for tracts in our sample is
1/6.
We restrict attention to sales of wildcat tracts off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana
held during the period 1954 to 1970 inclusive. The reason for doing so will become
clear in the next section.

3.1

The Variables

We turn next to the task of measuring the variables identified in the theoretical model
and discuss the associated measurement problems. Recall that the theoretical model
identified four variables of interest: Vt , the value of the oil and gas deposit on tract t;
Bit , the bid of bidder i on tract t; Mit , the maximum bid of bidder i’s rivals on tract
t or, in the absence of a rival bid, the reserve price; and lt , the number of potential
bidders on tract t. The information available for each tract receiving at least one bid
are the date of sale; acreage; location; the identity of all bidders and the amounts
they bid; the identity of participants in joint bids and their shares in the bid; whether
the government accepted the high bid; the number, date, and depth of any wells that
were drilled; and monthly production through 1991 of oil, condensate, natural gas,
and other hydrocarbons.
The ex post value of a tract is defined to be discounted revenues less discounted
12

drilling costs and royalty payments. We converted production flows into revenues
using the real wellhead prices at the date of the sale, and discounted them to the auction date at a 5 percent per annum rate. The American Petroleum Institute conducts
an annual survey of drilling costs of wildcat and production wells for different regions
including off-shore Louisiana and Texas. We used these estimates, and information
on well depth, to compute drilling costs for each tract, classifying wells as productive
if the tract produced hydrocarbons and exploratory if it did not. These costs are
discounted to the auction date at a 5 percent per annum rate. Royalty payments are
computed from the discounted revenues by multiply this number by 1/6. Tracts not
drilled are given a value of zero.
There are several potential sources of error in our measure of ex post value. These
include the wellhead prices, production levels, discount rate, and drilling costs. The
use of wellhead prices at the auction date assumes that firms’ have identical and
constant expectations about the future prices of oil. The assumption of static expectations is plausible for sales held between 1954 and 1970 because real prices were
virtually constant during this period. But it is clearly implausible for sales held after
1973 when prices at auction dates differed considerably from actual prices over the
production life of the tracts. This is why we restricted our sample period and dropped
sales held after 1970. However, revenues are based on production through 1991. PostOPEC prices were considerably higher than prices during our sample period. If production flows depend on actual prices, our measure of revenues overestimates firms’
expectations at the auction date. The discount rate matters because drilling costs
must be incurred before production revenues are realized, and production may occur
for decades. Production histories are truncated in 1991, which introduces a downward bias in our measure of ex post values for some tracts although the magnitude
of the error is likely to be small when it is discounted back to the auction date. The
average production horizon was 15 years. Finally, if there are differences in drilling
costs across firms, the survey numbers we use contain a bias, as only the auction
winners are surveyed. Unfortunately, the reported survey results do not distinguish
among firms.
Should all bids on a tract be included? Our theoretical model assumes that
the potential bidders on a tract are symmetric. However, hundreds of firms bid
infrequently. They were unlikely to be as experienced and informed as the major
bidders and were probably not perceived as serious competitors by the major bidders.
We treat these firms as “noise” bidders, and focus our tests of rational bidding on the
twelve firms and bidding consortia with the highest participation rates in our sample.
Table l lists these major bidders and their bidding activities. The three bidding
consortia pooled their exploration budgets and expertise and bid almost exclusively
with each other. We treat these consortia as single firms. The twelve firms and
consortia are designated as large firms, which we call the Big12. All other firms are
13

referred to as fringe firms. For the purposes of this paper, we define a joint bid as
one in which two or more large firms participated. All other bids are called solo bids.
The first two columns of Table 1 give the number of solo and joint bids of each large
firm.6 The twelve large firms account for about 80% of all bids in our sample.
For each tract t, we select only bids by Big12 firms and, for the remainder of
the paper, the index i indexes one of the Big12 firms. However, in defining Mit ,
the maximum of the highest rival bid and the reserve price, we include all bidders,
including the fringe bidders. The reason is that a Big12 firm’s beliefs about winning
when it submits a bid should be consistent with the actual probability of winning at
that bid, which includes the possibility of a fringe bid.
Our measure of lt , the number of potential bidders on tract t, is constructed from
information on who bid in the area and when. For tracts that were drilled, location
is identified by the longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of the well. Tracts that
were not drilled are assigned coordinates by interpolation from nearby tracts that were
drilled.7 On average a tract covers 0.0463 degrees of longitude and 0.0405 degrees of
latitude. A neighborhood for tract t consists of all tracts whose registered locations are
within 0.1158 (2.5 times 0.0463) degrees of longitude and 0.1012 (2.5 times 0.0405)
degrees of latitude of tract t and that were offered for sale at the same time as
or before tract t. Ignoring irregular tract sizes and boundary effects, the maximum
possible size of a neighborhood is 25 tracts or 125,000 acres.
An obvious approach to defining the number of potential bidders on a tract is
simply to count the number of Big12 firms that bid on the tract or in its neighborhood.
The rationale is that if a Big12 firm is interested in the area, then it will probably
bid on at least one tract. The main difficulty with this measure is the treatment of
joint bids. Firms that submit solo bids on tract t are counted as potential bidders
since they are revealed to be active. Firms that submitted a joint bid on tract t
are treated as a single competitor, regardless of how they bid on other tracts in the
neighborhood of tract t. The implicit assumption here is that joint ventures are known
to competitors.8 We also include firms that did not bid on tract t but submitted solo
bids on at least one tract in the neighborhood. Firms that did not bid on tract t and
submitted only joint bids with each other on tracts in the neighborhood of tract t are
6

A small number of tracts registered multiple bids by a firm. This problem arose in part due
to classification errors in identifying a firm’s subsidiaries and affiliates. We adopted the following
rule for these bids. If a subset of the participants in one bid participated in another bid, the latter
is dropped. Thus, solo bids of bidders who also submitted joint bids are eliminated. In the other
cases, the highest bid is taken and the others dropped.
7
A small number of tracts were sufficiently isolated that it was not possible to interpolate their
location from nearby tracts. These tracts were dropped from the sample.
8
We alsocalculated the number of potential bidders under the alternative hypothesis that joint
ventures are private. However, the qualitative results did not change.

14

also counted as single competitors.
Our measure of the number of potential bidders on a tract may overstate the
true level of competition. Solo bids are always treated as evidence of competitive
behavior. But firms could coordinate bidding strategies by agreeing to bid solo on
different sets of tracts rather than bidding jointly. Our measure does not capture this
form of collusion. On the other hand, firms known to be interested in the area but
who decided not to bid on any tracts in the neighborhood of tract t are not counted
in lt . We might then underestimate the number of potential bidders.
The third column of numbers in Table 1 reports the number of tracts where each
large firm is counted as a potential bidder. The fourth column gives each firm’s bid
participation rate on tracts where it is a potential bidder. Note that this column is the
relevant one for evaluating the validity of the symmetry assumption. It reveals that
the variation in participation rates across firms is considerably less than the variation
in bid frequency rates (i.e., the number in column 3 divided by 1260, the number of
tracts receiving bids in the sample). The participation rates of most firms fall between
30 and 47 per cent. The AGCC consortium is the outlier with a participation rate
of 54%. In contrast, bid frequency rates vary more or less uniformly between 13 per
cent (Phillips) and 44 per cent (AGCC).
We conclude by noting one important feature of the data that is not incorporated
into the theoretical model. The location of the oil and gas deposits are spatially
correlated. That is, the random variables {Vt }Tt=1 are not independent. The spatial
correlation in deposits is reflected in the difference between the Big12 firms’ bid
frequency and participation rates. It would be surprising, therefore, if signals obtained
by a firm on tracts in the neighborhood of tract t are not informative about tract t.
The theoretical model ignores this spatial dependence by treating the bid decisions
on tracts as separate, independent decisions. Our hope is that information spillovers
do not invalidate our tests of rational bidding. However, in evaluating the statistical
significance of our tests, we do not ignore spatial correlation.

3.2

Sample Statistics

Table 2 provides summary statistics on wildcat sales in our sample. Typically, at least
one bid was submitted on approximately 50 per cent of the tracts offered in a sale.
Big12 firms typically bid on over 80 per cent of the tracts receiving bids in any given
sale. The government rejected the high bid on 7 per cent of the tracts receiving bids.
The unsold tracts receiving bids are mostly in later sales, and are mostly marginal
tracts. The fraction of tracts drilled and the fraction of hits (i.e., productive tracts)
among those that were drilled do not vary much across the larger sales, and are
typically about 75% and 50% respectively. Mean discounted revenues on productive
tracts are similar across the larger sales, with the notable exception of the sale in 1968
15

where revenues were only $12.2 million per tract. (All dollar magnitudes are in 1982
dollars.) Mean discounted net revenues are net of royalty payments and discounted
costs. They are calculated for all tracts, including “dry” tracts. Mean net revenues
vary considerably across the sales, averaging $10.5 million per tract across the sales.
The average winning bid for the entire sample is $6.2 million, which yields an average
“rent” of $4.3 million per tract. The average winning bid is substantially higher in
later sales.
Our sample consists of all wildcat tracts receiving bids in the nine sales held
between 1954 and 1970. Table 3 provides summary statistics on these tracts. The
tracts are classified by the number of potential bidders, which ranges from 0 to 12.
Recall that our count of potential bidders includes only Big12 firms, and there is
potential competition from fringe firms even when a firm knows it is the only large
potential bidder (i.e., l = 1). For each value of l, the first row gives the number of
tracts, the second gives the number of bids per tract, and the third gives the number
of Big12 bids per tract. The frequency distribution is approximately bi–modal, with
peaks at l = 3 and 9, and a median of 7. The number of bids is positively correlated
with, but often considerably smaller than, the number of potential bidders. Even
when all of the Big12 bidders are potential bidders, the average number of bids is
only 4.25. Note the sharp increase in the average number of bids at the median,
from 2.80 to 3.94. A comparison of rows two and three reveals that the probability
of a fringe bid increases with l, and on average there is one fringe bid. This suggests
that excluding fringe firms is probably not introducing too much error in our measure
of competition. Ex ante expectations, as measured by the high bid, are positively
correlated with l. The average high bid increases from $600 thousand on tracts where
none of the Big12 firms are potential bidders to $13.1 million on tracts where every
Big12 firm is a potential bidder. Note that there is a relatively large increase in the
level of the high bid when l increases from 6 to 7. The percentage of tracts drilled
increases with the number of potential bidders but the hit rate, defined relative to
the number of tracts drilled, appears to be independent of the number of potential
bidders for l greater than 2, fluctuating between 40 and 55%. Average revenue on
productive tracts is quite noisy and does not exhibit any trend as l increases. Net
revenue is higher on the more competitive tracts but once again the relationship
between these variables and l is noisy and not monotonic. By contrast, average hit
rates and revenues are strongly correlated with the number of bids (Porter [25]).
We also computed (but do not report) the average high bid, acreage bid, hit
rate, average revenue and net revenue for neighborhoods of tracts with l potential
bidders. The neighborhood variables all tend to increase with l, which reflects the
spatial correlation in deposits. In any region, one or two tracts receive most of the
action and competition tends to diminish the further away one gets from the center of
interest. The fraction of acreage in the neighborhood sold as wildcat tracts before or
16

after tract t is typically quite small. One reason is that the federal offshore lands have
been explored in a series of bands that extend along the coastline and move outward
over time from the shoreline further into the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, most of the
tracts in the neighborhood of tract t that were sold as wildcat tracts were sold in the
same sale as tract t. The other reason is that any tract in the neighborhood of tract t
that is sold in a later sale is likely to be classified as a drainage or development tract.
In the analysis that follows, we exclude tracts where the high bid was rejected,
and include only those with at least one Big12 potential bidder. The focus on Big12
bids excludes tracts with lt = 0. An argument for dropping tracts with lt = 1 is
that the bidding behavior of the Big12 firm on these tracts is likely to differ from
tracts where it knows it is competing against at least one other Big12 firm. However,
there is still potential fringe competition on tracts with one potential Big12 bidder.
Moreover, there are relatively few tracts in this category, and the results are similar
when these tracts are excluded.
We stratify the sample according to two categories of the number of potential
bidders, high and low. The low category is defined by 1 ≤ lt ≤ 6, and the high
category by lt > 6. The highly competitive set has 752 tracts and the less competitive
set has 501 tracts. Table 4 presents the frequency distribution of (base 10) log bid
for each category. Not surprisingly, the low l distribution has many fewer bids than
the high l distribution. Most of the density of the low l distribution lies in the range
5.4 to 7.0, which corresponds to bids of $250 thousand to $10 million. The main
difference between the low l and high l distributions, apart from the number of bids,
is that the latter contains relatively more high bids. There is a substantial number
of bids in the interval 7.0 to 7.8 ($10 million to $60 million) on high l tracts.
The classification of tracts into highly competitive and less competitive sets accounts for some tract heterogeneity. The following table, which is related to Table 3,
illustrates this point.
Low l

Clearly, the high l tracts are more likely to be productive than low l tracts. For
example, net revenues per productive tract are 52% higher on the more competitive
set than on the less competitive set. This partially explains why the average high bid
is higher on high l tracts than on low l tracts.

4

Preliminary Tests of Rational Bidding

In this section we implement several tests of bidder rationality. These tests are
essentially comparisons of bids and ex post outcomes
A basic test is that actual rents should be positive. Rents are measured as the
difference between average net revenues and the winning bid. Let wt and vt denote,
respectively, the winning bid and our estimate of the realization of V on tract t. Then
the average value of rents for a sample of tracts of size T is given by
R=T

−1

T
X

[vt − wt ].

t=1

A second related test is that firms should expect to earn positive rents conditional
on submitting a winning bid. Let Z0t denote an index of characteristics of tract t
that are observable to the bidders (including lt ). Define w
bit as the estimate of bidder
i’s valuation of the tract conditional upon winning with a bid of bit . It is obtained
by estimating the function E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit < b, Z0t = z0 ] (see Appendix A.2 for
details) and then evaluating this function at b = bit . The difference between w
bit and
bit represents bidder i’s expected profit margin conditional on winning tract t. The
average profit margin for a sample of tracts of size T is
D = T −1

T X
nt

t=1 i=1

n−1

t [w

Furthermore, a comparison of rents and bidder profit margins across low and high
l tracts should reveal whether firms take into account the “winner’s curse”. If they
failed to do so, then actual rents and margins should be substantially lower on high
l tracts than low l tracts, and perhaps even negative.
The values of D and R for high and low l tracts are reported in the table below. The standard deviations of the statistics are reported in parentheses. They are
obtained from the bootstrap procedure that is described in the appendix.
Low l
High l

R
D
$3.75 (1.73) $3.76 (1.54)
$3.65 (2.89) $3.56 (1.30)

The average rents and margins are essentially the same on each set of tracts, and do
not vary significantly with the level of competition. Thus, there is no adverse selection
associated with winning, which is consistent with bidders anticipating the “winner’s
curse”. We also calculated the average margin as a percentage of average value. The
percentages on low and high competition tracts are 65% and 38% respectively.
18

Are the magnitude of the rents plausible? We have referred to R as the average
rent but it is more accurately called the average quasi-rent since it does not include entry costs. Under the assumption that entry rates are determined by a zero (expected)
profit condition, the expected rent from bidding on a tract should be approximately
equal to total entry costs. A bidder’s entry cost consists primarily of the price of a
seismic survey and the cost of hiring engineers to study the survey data and prepare
a bid. The magnitude of these costs is probably several hundreds of thousands of
dollars per bidder per tract. These costs have to be recovered from rents earned
on tracts won. Consequently, given measurement error, one is unlikely to reject the
hypothesis that the average rent is equal to total entry costs in either set of tracts.
Did bidders bid less than their expected tract value? The rent and bid margins
calculated above suggest that they did so in aggregate but a stronger test of rationality
is to examine whether they did so at every bid level. We wish to test the restriction
that
E[Vt |Bit = b, Z0t = z0 ] > b
at all bid levels. We refer to this test as (T1). Rational bidders in a common value
environment should also anticipate the “bad news” associated with winning. That
is, at every bid level, they should bid less than their expected value of the tract
conditional on winning,
E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit < b, Z0t = z0 ] > b.
We refer to this test as (T2). The difference between these two conditional expectations is a measure of the “winner’s curse”,
κ(b) = E[Vt |Bit = b, Z0t = z0 ] − E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit < b, Z0t = z0 ].
The key tract characteristic on which we condition the tests is the number of potential
bidders. In a symmetric common values environment, the winner’s curse measure
should be greater when there is more competition, as winning is worse news the
larger the number of potential bidders. We examine this prediction. Note that both
of the above tests and our measure of “winner’s curse” can be applied to individual
bidders, or to a set of bidders.
Figure 1 plots estimates of the average value of Vt conditional on b and the average
value conditional on the event of winning at b for low l tracts, where there is less
potential competition. In both cases, the estimates of the conditional expectations
are computed from a univariate locally linear regression. The former estimate, which
is the basis for (T1), employs the full sample of bids submitted by Big12 firms,
whereas the latter uses the subsample of winning bids by the Big12. Details of the
nonparametric estimation procedures can be found in the Appendix. We also plot a
19

45 degree line, so that these conditional expectations can be compared to the relevant
bid level. We use a (base 10) log scale for both axes of the figure. Both conditional
expectation functions are above the 45 degree line over the observed range of bids,
which means that Big12 bidders satisfy the rationality tests (T1) and (T2) in the
aggregate. Throughout the range of bids, the average value of tracts won by large
firms at b is substantially lower than the average value of tracts that received a bid of
b. Furthermore, the difference increases weakly with b. The difference is depicted in
levels in Figure 1a, as a function of log bid. For example, at a bid of $1 million, the
difference is on the order of $2 million. A block bootstrap procedure, described in
Appendix B, is employed to derive a one–sided 95% confidence band for our estimate
of the winner’s curse. The confidence band depicted in Figure 1a indicates that the
difference between the two expectation functions is marginally significant at the 5%
level.
Figure 2 plots estimates of the same two conditional expectations for high l tracts.
The results are qualitatively similar to those reported for low l tracts. Figure 2a
presents our estimate of “winner’s curse” and its confidence band for tracts with
more competition. Measured relative to bid, the “winner’s curse” appears to be
larger for the high l tracts than the low l tracts. For example, the difference between
bidding $1 million and winning at $1 million is on the order of $5 million on high l
tracts. Figure 2a indicates that the difference between the two expectation functions
is significant for bids less than $1 million, but marginally significant at higher bid
levels. It suggests that the “winner’s curse” is present and increases weakly with bid.
However, most of the large firms appear to anticipate the “curse” and bid on the
order of 1/3rd of the average value conditional on winning.9
The above analysis of aggregate bidding on the part of Big12 firms indicates that
they pass our tests of rational bidding, (T1) and (T2).10 Averaged across all bids, we
estimate the value of the winner’s curse to be $2.73 million on low l tracts, and $6.13
million on high l tracts. The respective standard errors are $1.18 million and $1.61
million. The estimate of winner’s curse is 107% of the average winning bid on low l
tracts, and 75% on high l tracts.
In order to determine whether the results are affected by the categorization of
tracts, we replicated the calculations above for three sets of tracts, according to
whether the number of potential bidders was less than six, between six and eight, or
9

These results are derived under the hypothesis of common values and the reader should not
interpret them as evidence for the common value model. As we explain in Section 7, they are not
inconsistent with an affiliated private values model.
10
We also computed the conditional expectations for individual firms and found that most firms
bid rationally. However, Texaco not only failed to anticipate the “winner’s curse”, it also failed to
bid less than the average value conditional on its bid. Its E[Vt |Bit = b] curve lies everywhere below
b.

20

more than eight. The results are qualitatively similar, with the ordering preserved,
although the confidence bands are much wider.

Tests of Equilibrium Bidding

In this section we present the tests of equilibrium bidding. Define
ξ(b, G(b; z0 )) = b +

GMit |Bit ,Z0t (b|b, z0 )
.
gMit |Bit ,Z0t (b|b, z0 )

Similarly, we define the functions ζ(b, z0 ) and γ(b, z0 ) by conditioning the expectations
on tract characteristics. We wish to test the following restrictions: (i) ξ(b, G (b; z0 ))
is strictly increasing in b, (ii) ζ(b, z0 ) = ξ(b, G(b; z0 )) and (iii) γ(b, z0 ) = ξ(b, G(b; z0 )).
If bidding is consistent with Bayesian Nash equilibrium, we should fail to reject (i)
and (ii) and reject (iii), which we have defined as myopic bidding. The key tract
characteristic that we observe is l and we condition the tests on this variable. Bidders
may observe other characteristics, but since the monotonicity and equality tests hold
for each realization of Z0t , they must also hold in the aggregate. Therefore, an
important property of the tests is that they are not sensitive to unobserved tract
heterogeneity.
For each category of l, the bid data used to compute the conditional expectations
ζ and γ and the distribution function GMit |Bit ,Z0t are all pairs (bit , mit ) where i indexes
one of the Big12 firms and mit is the maximum bid of the rivals or, in the absence
of any rival bid, the reserve price. Recall that all bidders, including fringe bidders,
are used to determine mit . Note that, for our purposes, it is sufficient to estimate
the fraction of leases in which no potential rival submits a bid, GMit |Bit ,Z0t (r|b, z0 ).
Since we assume that we observe the set of potential rivals, it is straightforward
to estimate this fraction. It would be much more difficult to estimate a structural
model of bidding, in which case the fraction would have to be decomposed into the
probability of becoming an active bidder, and the probability of bidding conditional
on being active. The estimates of the conditional expectation ζ are computed from a
bivariate locally linear regression. The estimates for ξ are obtained from an estimate
of the distribution GMit |Bit ,Z0t .

can be compared to the relevant bid level. At any bid level b, the vertical difference
between b
ξ and the 45 degree line represents the factor by which bidders mark down
their bid from their conditional expectation of tract value. The difference should be
positive and Figure 3 reveals that this is the case throughout the range of bids. Note
that the markdown in this case is relative to the bidder’s expected value conditional
21

on the event that the maximum signal among its rivals is equal to its own signal, not
conditional on the event of winning. It should not be interpreted as a measure of
the bidder’s expected profit. The second point to note about b
ξ is that it is strictly
increasing throughout the range of bids. Hence, the above model passes our first test
of equilibrium bidding, at least for the set of tracts where competition is low. The
conditional expectation b
ζ also lies above the 45 degree line for the relevant range of
bids and is increasing throughout. However, the difference b
ζ −b
ξ does not appear to
be close to zero, except for bids near $1 million. At higher bid levels, bidders appear
to overestimate the value of the tract at the time of bidding.
Clearly, a formal test of equality of ξ and ζ is needed. Such a test would probably
contain elements of tests for the hypothesis that a nonparametric regression function
is zero everywhere. It requires the derivation of the asymptotic distribution of an
estimate of the (properly renormed) difference ζ − ξ. In addition, since the small
sample properties of such a test are likely to be poor a bootstrap correction may need
to be applied. There is a fairly large literature on bootstrapped confidence bands of
nonparametric regression estimators (see e.g. Hall [9] and the references therein). Our
estimator does not fit any of the standard cases and obtaining asymptotic refinements,
i.e. confidence bands more accurate than those obtained by first order asymptotics, is
very difficult. We are satisfied with obtaining confidence bands which are asymptotically valid. To account for spatial dependence, we employ a block bootstrap procedure
(Künsch [14]), described in Appendix B. Figure 3a presents the results. The solid
curve labelled “zero” gives the probability that the test statistic (i.e., b
ζ −b
ξ) takes
values less than zero. The dashed line gives the graph of the statistic itself to show
its position relative to its own distribution. Rejection of the null hypothesis therefore
occurs when the zero curve transcends one of the lines labelled “rejection band.” At
higher bid levels, the probability that the difference is negative is very close to one,
which represents a clear rejection of the theory.
Figure 4 plots estimates of b
ξ and b
ζ for high l tracts. As in the case of low l tracts,
b
ξ is strictly increasing in bid and lies above the 45 degree line. Hence, Bayesian Nash
equilibrium behavior is not rejected. The conditional expectation function b
ζ also lies
above the 45 degree line, except at very low bid levels, and it is strictly increasing
throughout. But, in contrast to the low l case, the difference b
ζ −b
ξ is close to zero
at most bid levels. Figure 4a depicts a formal test of equality. The results indicate
that the hypothesis of equilibrium bidding is not rejected at conventional confidence
levels in the middle of the support of the bid distribution. There is some evidence
of rejection at very low (i.e., less than $500 thousand) and at high (more than $10
million) bid levels.
We tested the equality of γ and ξ in exactly the same way as the equality of ζ and
ξ. Here we simply report the results of the test. At conventional confidence levels, the

22

myopic model of bidding was rejected for low l and high l tracts. We conclude from
these tests that firms do take into account the “bad news” of winning in formulating
their bids, and for the more competitive tracts, they appear to get the magnitudes
right.
An important feature of our tests is that we have not imposed any structure on
the bidders’ participation decisions in estimating ξ and ζ. We have simply assumed
that expectations are consistent with the empirical law governing Mit . An alternative
estimation strategy is to exploit the underlying structure of the probability law of
Mit to estimate GMit |Bit ,Z0t and ζ more efficiently using the entire vector of bids on
each tract, including the “zeros”, and estimates of the participation probabilities. We
have not done so because we are not sufficiently confident of any specific participation
model or our estimates of such a model to impose this structure. The main difficulty
is with interpreting the “zeros”. We would need to differentiate between potential
bidders who did not bid because they were not active, and active bidders who chose
not to bid because they did not obtain favorable information. We would also have
to take a stand on whether bidders observe the number of active bidders. At this
point, we prefer to forgo possible gains in efficiency in order to reduce the risk of
misspecification.
Finally, we checked the robustness of our results by estimating all three functions
for three categories of tracts, in which the number of potential bidders is low, medium
or high. The results for the medium and high number cases are similar those of the
high competition results reported above, whereas the results for five or fewer potential
bidders are similar to those for six or fewer.

The Bid Function

In this section we propose an alternative to using equation (4) for estimating the
bid function. We employ this strategy to estimate β for high l and low l tracts and
examine the prediction that bidders may bid less aggressively on tracts with more
bidders.
Our approach to resolving the identification problem is to impose a moment restriction on the joint distribution of (Sit , Vt ). Wilson [29] adopts the normalization
E[Sit |Vt = v] = v, where signals are measured so that the mean signal on a tract is
equal to the tract’s value. We instead assume that
E[Vt |Sit = s, Z0t = z0 ] = s.
Condition (R) states that if a firm obtains a signal s on a tract with characteristics
z0 , then the expected value of that tract is equal to the value of the signal. Signals are
normalized in terms of ex post value and we assume that firms’ posterior estimates
23

are not biased but correct on average. Identification of the bid function follows
immediately from condition (R) and monotonicity of the bid function since
s

= E[Vt |Sit = s, Z0t = z0 ] = E[Vt |Bit = β(s, z0 ), Z0t = z0 ]
=⇒ η(b, z0 ) = E[Vt |Bit = b, Z0t = z0 ].

(6)

Equation (6) defines an inverse bid function.11 It can be estimated as follows. For
every bid level b on a tract with characteristics z0 , define a neighborhood (in the
space of bids, not locations) B(z0 ) of b, and compute the average ex post value of all
tracts with characteristics z that received a bid in B(z0 ). To implement this idea, we
employ a kernel estimator of the mean ex post value in the neighborhood of any bid
b for tracts with similar characteristics.
Condition (R) is more than a normalization assumption on the distribution of
signals. It extends the conditional independence assumption, condition (ii) of the
Information Assumptions, to include Z0t . Thus, tract characteristics may influence
the participation decisions of potential bidders, but they do not affect an active
bidder’s beliefs about Vt conditional on observing its seismic signal. If the sample
is stratified according to some characteristic z0 , then the condition is a statement
about the joint distribution of (Vt , Sit ) and other characteristics that are observed by
the bidders, but not necessarily by the econometrician, conditional on z0 . Bidding
behavior depends upon z0 since it affects the distribution of Nt (and Kt ). For example,
lt is an element of z0 .
Figure 5 presents estimates of the bid functions for tracts with large and small
numbers of potential bidders. That is, in Figure 5 we restrict our attention to one
observable tract characteristic z0 , whether or not the number of potential bidders is
relatively large, and stratify the sample according to that characteristic. The estimated bid function is not monotonic in the subsample with a large number of bidders,
in the region of bids between $1 million and $1.5 million. This region is approximately
the mode of the bid distribution for this subsample, and so non-monotonicity cannot
be attributed to a small sample size.
Condition (R) allows us to examine the comparative static prediction that bidders
may bid less aggressively when the number of bidders is high. More aggressive bidding
with more competition is also consistent with common values, but our presumption
is that in a comparison of tracts with seven or more potential bidders to those with
six or fewer, the winner’s curse effect will dominate the effects of more competition.
Figure 5 indicates that firms did bid somewhat less aggressively on high l tracts than
low l tracts for a given signal. Figure 6 presents the corresponding estimate of the
density of private signals for high and low l tracts. Clearly, the distribution of signals
11

As one of the referees has observed, condition R can also be used to identify the common value
model provided data on ex post values are available in addition to bid data.

24

on high l tracts stochastically dominates (in the first order sense) the distribution of
signals on the low l tracts.
In some sense, our identifying assumption leads us to a nonparametric reverse
regression of ex post value on bid and tract characteristics. The alternative identifying
restriction, that the conditional mean of signals is the ex post value (i.e., E[Sit |Vt =
v] = v, or E[Sit |Vt = v, Z0t = z0 ] = v) would lead us to regress bid on value and
tract characteristics. One problem with the alternative condition is that it is unlikely
to be satisfied for high values of Vt , as well as zero values. In our data, there is
less variability in bids than in our measure of ex post value, which equals zero on
many tracts. A second problem with the alternative method is that ex post value
is measured with error. One would favor the results of the reverse regression under
the supposition that the measurement error is relatively severe, and, consistent with
this supposition, the estimated slope of the bid function from the regression of bid on
value is much less than that from the reverse regression.
These comparative statics results are suggestive, rather than definitive, because
of the maintained assumptions, the Information Assumptions and condition (R). We
also computed the relationship between bids and ex post payoffs conditional on the
local neighborhood variables described in Section 3.2, in addition to conditioning
on our measure of competition, but these results were not informative. A problem
with the neighborhood variables is that they combine both ex ante and ex post
information. The latter characteristic is problematic for the purpose of computing
bid functions, given the spatial correlation in information and returns. Nevertheless,
these neighborhood variables may be useful in estimating bid participation models.

The Common Value Assumption

The analysis of the previous sections and our interpretation of the results presumes
that the bidding environment for oil and gas auctions is pure common value. In
contrast, Li, Perrigne and Vuong [18] adopt the alternative assumption that the
bidding environment is private values. The OCS auctions probably contain both
common and private valuation components and as such are best described by a general
affiliated values model. The question that we address in this section is whether the
data suggest that the common component is a quantitatively more significant factor
in the bidder valuations than the private component.
The argument for the common value case is that the firms are uncertain about
common components of the value of the lease being sold, such as the size of any oil or
gas deposits under the tract, the prices of oil and gas over the likely production horizon
if the lease is productive, and the common costs of exploration and development.
The first component is likely to matter, because firms may have private information
25

about the size of the deposits based on the seismic data they obtain, especially their
interpretation of that data.
Alternatively, one might argue that there is little discrepancy in private assessments of these common components, and instead that valuations differ because of
differences in bidder specific components of valuations. The most likely sources of
bidder payoff heterogeneity are the private components of exploration and drilling
costs. Bidders are not likely to differ in their valuation of recovered deposits, to the
extent that there is a well developed market for oil and gas. Under this alternative
view, valuations are best modelled as private, although they may be affiliated because
of the common unknown components of payoffs that may be correlated with publicly
available information.
One may be tempted to argue that the results described in Figure 5 that bidders
bid less aggressively in more competitive auctions are inconsistent with the assumption of private values. This would be valid if the private values are independent
draws since, in that case, more competition leads to more aggressive bidding. However, Pinkse and Tan [24] show that in a class of affiliated private value environments
the equilibrium bid function is not monotonically increasing in the number of bidders.
Consequently, the fact that bids or even the winning bid are not increasing in the
number of bidders is not conclusive evidence of common values.
Haile, Hong and Shum [8] provide a test for distinguishing between the two kinds
of environments that is based on equation (4). Define
bt (bit ; z0t ))
σ
bit = b
ξ(bit , G

as the pseudo-value corresponding to bidder i’s bid on tract t. Under the hypothesis
of private values, this is an estimate of bidder i’s valuation of tract t but, under
the hypothesis of common values, it is an estimate of w(η(bit ), η(bit )). Exogenous
variation in the number of bidders can distinguish between these two interpretations.
The empirical distribution of pseudo-values should be the same on low l tracts as it
is on high l tracts if values are private, and it should be stochastically increasing in l
if the common component is important. The difficulty with applying this test to our
data is unobserved tract heterogeneity. That is, consistent with our model of entry,
the number of potential bidders may be correlated with tract value. The empirical
distribution of Vt is stochastically increasing in lt so, not surprisingly, bidders bid
more on average on tracts with higher values of lt .
A similar problem arises in trying to interpret the results presented in Figures
1 and 2 as evidence against private values. Absent unobserved heterogeneity, this
conclusion would be correct since winning should not affect valuations in a private
values environment. But, to see why unobserved heterogeneity matters, consider an
APV setting. At a given bid level b, the bid is more likely to win if the idiosyncratic
26

component of valuation is favorable. Hence the expected common component of valuations is lower conditional on winning. That is, there is a selection effect associated
with conditioning on winning. Furthermore, the magnitude of the selection effect is
higher on high l tracts than on low l tracts.
Consider, for example, the APV case in which bidder i’s private value on tract t
is Vit , where the Vit ’s are conditionally independent and identically distributed given
an unknown common component Vt . Our winner’s curse measure
κ(b) = E[Vt |Bit = b] − E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit ≤ b]
= E[Vt |Vit = η(b)] − E[Vt |Vit = η(b), Yit ≤ η(b)]
where η(·) is the inverse of the equilibrium APV strategy and Yit = max j=i Vjt .
Because (Vt , Vit , Yit ) are affiliated, κ(b) is strictly positive. Hence a positive value of
κ(b) does not rule out an APV environment. A positive value is inconsistent with an
IPV environment, however. Moreover, in this APV example κ(b) is increasing in the
number of potential bidders.
The condition that the reserve price is binding can be useful. In a private value
environment, ξ must satisfy the boundary condition, limb↓r ξ(b, G(b)) = r, which
implies
GMit |Bit (b|b)
lim
−→ 0.
b↓r gMit |Bit (b|b)
By contrast, in a common values environment, ξ is discontinuous at r, which implies
that
GMit |Bit (b|b)
lim
−→ c > 0.
b↓r gMit |Bit (b|b)
Therefore, it is possible in principle to distinguish between the two models by examining the behavior of GMit |Bit near the reserve price.12 Unfortunately, the reserve
price in OCS auctions is not fixed. The government frequently rejected high bids
near the announced minimum bid of $15 per acre and, as a result, there are too few
bids in this range to implement the test with any confidence. It might be possible to
estimate the rejection decision of the government, i.e., the probability of accepting
the high bid b, in conjunction with the empirical distribution of the highest rival bid,
and then interpret GMit |Bit as the probability that bidder i’s bid is the highest and is
accepted.
The approach that we adopt is to compute rents and profit margins under the
hypotheses of private values and evaluate their plausibility. Let wt denote the winning
12

A similar result holds for second-price auctions. Milgrom and Weber [22] observe that, in a
CV environment, the difference between E[Vt |Sit = s∗ , Yit ≤ s∗ ] and the amount that s∗ bids,
E[Vt |Sit = s∗ , Yit = s∗ ], implies a lower bound for the distribution of bids that is strictly above the
reserve price, r. No such gap should be present in a private value environment.

Even after accounting for entry costs, private value rents seem quite large. What
type of barriers to entry prevent bidders from increasing their participation rates to
take advantage of rents in order of $20 million? The magnitudes of the bid margins
tells a similar story. Bidders marked down their bids independently of the number
of potential bidders and by slightly more than $14 million. Under private values, the
percentage markdowns at the average are 88% for low l tracts and 72% for high l
tracts. In other words, firms are bidding slightly more than 1/9 of their estimate of
the bidder specific value on low l tracts, and less than 1/3 on high l tracts.
A related difficulty with assuming private values alone is that there is considerable
within tract variation in bids (Porter [25]). For example, the second highest bid on a
given tract averages about 56 per cent of the highest bid. In a symmetric private values
model, such extreme variation in bids can be rationalized only if there is large variation
in the private components of values. Yet the variation in valuations necessary to
generate the observed variation in bids is an implausible order of magnitude. The
large variation in bids accounts for the large implied markdowns we compute, as
rational bidders can shade their bids considerably without lowering the probability
of winning too much.
In summary, the OCS lease auctions probably contain both common and private
valuation components, and hence are best described by a general affiliated values
model, but the data suggest that the former components are more important.

Conclusion

The main conclusions to be drawn from the preceding empirical analysis are (1) that
the “winner’s curse” is evident in the data and (2) that the bidders are aware of its
presence and bid accordingly. Bidding behavior appears to be largely consistent with
a symmetric common value environment, given our measure of potential competition
and our measure of ex post returns. In contrast, some features of bidding behavior
appear to be inconsistent with a private values environment. To repeat, the bidders’
valuations in OCS auctions probably have both private and common components,
but the common components appear to be important.
The theoretical model of the paper may be employed to examine the participation
decisions of the potential bidders, and thereby obtain more efficient estimates of
bidding rules. We hope to pursue this direction in future work.

Estimation Methods

There are four functions that need to be estimated: E[Vt |Bit = b], E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit <
b], E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit = b], and ξ(b, G). We estimate each of these functions nonparametrically. The procedures are described below. All computations employ log (base
10) bids.

A.1

Local Linear Regression, One Regressor

We estimate the conditional expectation function E[Vt |Bit = b] on the sample of all
bids {bit } (within the same number of potential bidders class) and tract values {vt }
using the following formula at each value of b (Stone [27])
{b

where T is the number of tracts in the sample, h is the bandwidth and k the kernel.
We use a standard normal kernel and a bandwidth chosen by visual inspection.13
The conditional expectation E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit < b] is estimated on the sample of
winning bids {wt } and tract values {vt } using the formula,
{w(b),

Each term in the summation of equation (6) includes a weight equal to the reciprocal of the number of bids on tract. This weighting is necessary to compare
E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit < b] and the other statistics, since only one bid per tract is used for
the computation of E[Vt |Bt = b, Mit < b], whereas all bids are used in the computation of the other statistics.

A.2

Local Linear Regression, Two Regressors

The conditional expectation E[Vt |Bit = b, Mit = b] is estimated on the sample of all
bid pairs {bit , mit } and tract values {vt } (within the same number of potential bidders

We experimented with an automatic bandwidth selection procedure, generalized cross validation
(Wahba [28]), but this procedure broke down because of the presence of some extreme revenue values.

Pseudo-Values

As in Li, Perrigne and Vuong [17], we estimate GL and gL , the distribution and density
of base 10 log bids, and then derive the ratio of the distribution and the density of
bid levels according to (omitting subscripts) G(b|b)/g(b|b) = b log(GL /gL ). Note that
GMit |Bit (b|b) = P [Mit < b|Bit = b] = E[I(Mit < b)|Bit = b], where I is an indicator
function. We estimate GMit |Bit (b|b)/gMit |Bit (b|b) using the formula

Since GMit |Bit (b|b) is discontinuous at b = r, estimates of gMit |Bit (b|b) close to b = r
are biased upward but are not inconsistent.14 In our sample no tracts received bids
at the announced reserve price.

B

Bootstrap

The bootstrap procedure used is a spatial block bootstrap. Except for the rent
calculations, the number of bootstrap replications is 10,000. For the rent calculations,
the estimated standard deviations are based on 1,000 bootstrap replications. The
computations were carried out on a 300 MHz PowerMac running Mac OS X Server.
The bootstrap procedure is not pivotal and the bootstrap approximation error
therefore decreases at the same rate as when the asymptotic distribution is derived
by first order asymptotics (Hall [9]).
The procedure is outlined below.
1. Number all tracts 1 through T.
14

However, they are not uniformly consistent.

34

2. Denote by qt the reciprocal of the number of tracts in Λt , the neighborhood of
tract t, including tract t itself.
P
P
3. Let Qt = ts=1 qs / Ts=1 qs
4. Draw a random number r in [0, 1].
5. Find the tract t whose value of Qt is the closest to r.
6. Add tract t to the bootstrap sample.
7. Add all tracts in the neighborhood of tract t to the bootstrap sample.
8. Repeat steps 4–7 until the number of tracts in the bootstrap sample is greater
than or equal to T.
9. Eliminate tracts at the end of the bootstrap sample such as to make the number
of bootstrap tracts equal to the number of sample tracts.
10. Compute all statistics for the bootstrap sample.
11. Repeat steps 4 through 10 R times, where R denotes the number of replications.
Several points about the procedure are worth noting. First, the block bootstrap
is needed to accommodate dependence across tracts. In the ‘normal’ bootstrap one
would make T independent draws from the tract distribution. We make a number of
independent draws from the neighborhood distribution, such as to make the number
of tracts in the bootstrap sample equal to T . Second, because a tract is selected either
directly or as part of the neighborhood of a directly selected tract, tracts in regions
where a lot of tracts are bid are more likely to be selected. This is countered in step
5 by making the probability that tract t is selected directly inversely proportional to
the number of tracts in Λt . The procedure is not perfect, but it eliminates most of
the variability. Finally, the number of bids varies a little from bootstrap sample to
bootstrap sample, but generally by less than 5% in either direction.
