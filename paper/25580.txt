Amenities, Risk, and Flood Insurance Reform

NBER Working Paper No. 25580
February 2019
JEL No. D31,H2,H84,Q51,Q54
ABSTRACT
This paper provides the first, comprehensive evidence on the question of whether the subsidized flood
insurance rates are needed to meet the affordability goal of the National Flood Insurance Program.
We use IRS records at the zip code level from 2009 to 2016 to compare the real median incomes of
homeowners in areas subject to flooding risks to those homeowners in neighboring zip codes. Our
analysis includes all of the Gulf Coast states and over 1000 other communities around the United States
containing FEMA designated Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). There are clear patterns of positive
income stratification for coastal locations in Florida, New Jersey, and New York. We also find lower
income for coastal locations in California, North Carolina, as well as the shoreline along rivers identified
as in SFHA in Delaware, and Virginia fit this pattern.

Amenities, Risk, and Flood Insurance Reform
V. Kerry Smith and Ben Whitmore

1. Introduction
Last year, 2017, was estimated to be the most costly for hurricane damage in the U.S. to date,
causing over $306 billion in losses. Significant storms in Florida and North Carolina this past fall
suggest the pattern is continuing. Indeed, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s
(FEMA) 2018 third quarter Watermark report estimates over $40 billion as the probable
maximum annual loss. This pattern of flood and hurricane related damage is not news. A number
of authors have recognized the rising toll of extreme weather events (see Kousky [2017], Kousky
and Lingle [2017], Bin et al. [2017], and Walls et al. [2018] as a few examples). While several
analyses of the effects of climate change suggest that an increase in severe, coastal storms is one
likely outcome (Emanuel [2005] and Knutson and Tuleya [2004]), people’s decisions in
selecting places to live are also contributing factors influencing the damages from these storms.
In understanding these decisions there are at least three elements to be considered: (a)
households are attracted to coastal amenities; (b) their perceptions of the risks associated with
coastal hazards may not be accurate; and (c) the incentives created by government policies can
induce misguided responses.
The last of these, policy, is especially important as Congress has continued to postpone
reforms to federal flood insurance 1. The federal government has been responsible for this
insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for 50 years and the insurance
rates for protection often bear little relationship to the flood risks. The Congressional Budget
Office [2017] (CBO) estimated that 85% of the policies in the highest risk areas (Zone V) were
subsidized and that the average subsidy was 40% of rates that would be set on actuarial basis 2.

The most recent of three short term re-authorizations took place on 12/21/2018 and extends the program in its
current form to 5/31/2019.

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Department of

2

The magnitude of the “grandfathered” subsidies differs by flood zone, elevation conditions for
the properties involved, and whether those properties received federal assistance in the past 3.
Popular opinion editorials (Siguad [2018] for example) have raised concerns that these subsidies
primarily go to wealthy homeowners. All of these comparisons, including the recent FEMA
[2018] affordability analysis, are based on summary statistics for samples subject to selection
effects. That is, they generally compare income of policyholders with those who have chosen not
to buy insurance. More importantly, they provide an incomplete picture of the population
actually facing flood risks and the key policy questions associated with them, namely, is the
affordability goal motivating public subsidies needed, and, if it is, how should it be met? This
conclusion follows from Kousky and Lingle [2018] recent analysis of the geographic distribution
of the NFIP residential policies using data from February 2018. They found that 3% of all US
counties account for 75% of the policies and that these are concentrated along the Gulf and
Atlantic coasts. These authors also note in the last decade every state has experienced a
damaging flood.
This paper provides the first, comprehensive, national evidence on the question of whether
the affordability of flood insurance rates is relevant to those households facing these risks. We
use IRS records at the zip code level from 2009 to 2016 to compare the real median incomes of
homeowners in areas subject to flooding risks to those homeowners in neighboring zip codes. By
exploiting geography we use this comparison as a partial control for other characteristics likely
to also be important to locational decisions such as access to employment, local public services,
and other local conditions (i.e. climate, state and local taxes, etc.). Our analysis includes all of
the Gulf Coast states and over 1000 other communities around the United States in FEMA
designated Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA).

Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have a variety of programs with grants to homeowners (regardless of
whether they have insurance), subsidized loans, and other funds that are intended to reduce the time for local
communities to return to normal conditions, but which have the added effect of creating counterproductive
incentives. Kousky, Michel-Kerjan, and Raschky [2017] found, for the case of Florida, that these types of assistance
reduce average insurance coverage. A dollar increase in the average aid grant reduced the average insurance
coverage by about six dollars.

Zone V designates a coastal area where the velocity of wave action adds at least 3 feet to the water level that is
reached in a 100year flood. Zone A designates a 100year floodplain or on in which there is at least a 1 percent
annual probability of flooding and not designated as Zone V. Zone X is any mapped area not inside a 100 year
floodplain. See Appendix B of the Congressional Budget Office [2017] report for discussion NFIP subsidies.

3

Three important insights emerge from our assessment. The first stems from a recognition that
extensions to the Tiebout [1956] sorting logic (Kuminoff et al. [2013]) would imply that strong
preferences for coastal amenities tend to induce income stratification, with high amenity areas
having a greater proportion of high income households than those areas with low coastal
amenities. Our findings suggest that once risk is introduced into this framework the predictions
are not always upheld. The effects of proximity depend on the resource that is the source of the
coastal or water related amenities and the characteristics of the surrounding area. Second, the
character of the income distribution, as reflected in the real median income, for areas with waterbased amenities compared to nearby locations is remarkably consistent over time. High income
areas remain that way regardless of the history of floods involved over the period of our analysis.
The same is true for areas where we don’t find stratification by income for locations adjoining
water-based resources. Third, and finally, the geographic comparison group used as a control to
gauge the effects of amenity and risk can matter in judging the estimated incidence of flood
policy and the associated conclusions about affordability. So in contrast to some of the popular
criticisms of the NFIP there is not one answer to the affordability question when it is considered
simply on the basis of location.
We begin this description of the conceptual and empirical dimensions of our research in the
next section with summaries of the time profile for real median incomes in Florida and
Louisiana. These comparisons highlight why the research design we adopted to describe the
incidence of the NFIP program is so important. After that, in section 3, we describe the
implications of the single crossing property for sorting outcomes with amenities and risk. This
section also outlines the connection between our research design and Musgrave’s [1959]
definition of incidence for judging the distributional effects of policies. We adapt his definition
to reflect Hendren’s [2018] logic for evaluating policies involving risk. Section 4 describes our
data and models. Five summarizes the results. Section 6 relates our findings to other recent
research on the affordability issue and the NFIP. The last section summarizes the research and
comments on its policy implications.
2. Setting the Stage
Three figures introduce and illustrate the importance of understanding the effects of sorting
and its persistent impact on which households benefit from the current NFIP policies. Figures 1,

4

2, and 3 plot the real median income (in 2015 dollars) for coastal and adjoining interior zip codes
for the Gulf Coast of Florida, the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, and the Atlantic Coast of Florida each
year from 2009 to 2016. These income measures are developed using administrative data
constructed at the zip code level from the IRS income tax returns.
Figures 1 and 2 use the IRS income measures at the zip code level for Florida and Louisiana.
To construct measures for the real median incomes we used the conditional income distributions
reported by zip code for intervals of adjusted gross income associated with those households who
took a mortgage interest deduction. 4 The IRS records for the Gulf Coast of Florida and Louisiana
are also consistent with the HMDA records 5. When we use a model with a constant effect for
coastal locations compared to adjoining interior zip codes the estimates imply a $12,545 positive,
and significant, difference in real median incomes for the Gulf Coast of Florida, a positive and
significant difference of $17,916 for the Atlantic Coast of Florida, and a negative and significant
$12,960 difference for Louisiana. The findings from these models are discussed in more detail
below.
Each of the figures plots three curves. The top dashed line for the Florida Gulf and Atlantic
zip codes is the real median income for the coastal locations. The solid line immediately below it
(with “dots” identifying years) is the real median income for the adjacent interior locations. The
bottom solid line is the real median income for all households in the US in real terms ($2015). It
does not attempt to distinguish homeowners from renters and thus we would expect it to be
below our estimates for those claiming the mortgage interest deduction. This pattern reverses for
Louisiana with the dashed line associated with shoreline zip codes appearing below the solid line
for the real median incomes based on IRS records. Here the interior adjacent zip codes have
higher median incomes than coastal locations. Each of these estimates is derived as a conditional

4

The limits used to define the income distributions remained fixed from 2009 to 2016. They are: under $25,000;
$25,000 to $50,000; $50,000 to $75,000; $75,000 to $100,000; $100,000 to $200,000; and over $2000,000. We used
the Stata command gdsum, developed by Daniel Klein, University of Bamberg, daniel1.klein@gmx.de to estimate
the median and did not set an upper maximum for the open ended top interval in these distributions. The median, m.
is estimated as follows:𝑚𝑚 = 𝑙𝑙 +

(𝑛𝑛�2−𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐)
𝑛𝑛𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

∗ (𝜇𝜇 − 𝑙𝑙). with 𝑙𝑙 = lower bound of the median class, 𝜇𝜇 =

the upper bound of the median class, 𝑛𝑛𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = the number of observations in the median class (𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚), 𝑛𝑛 =
the number of observations, and 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = cumulative frequency in the class prior to the median class.

data from mortgage applications available thru the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA).

median estimated separately with regressions for coastal and non-coastal zip codes. The national
estimates are taken from reports by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
All these areas have been subject to hurricanes over the time span in our sample and the
differences in income levels remained consistent. These results imply locational sorting is more
complex than a simple story would imply. Of course, the ability to avoid flood risks depends on
the geography of each area. The nature of the coastal amenity is also exceptionally different
between the Florida locations and the majority of Louisiana’s coastal locations which are
primarily wetlands 6.
For now, our takeaway message is that there is clear evidence consistent with the positive
income stratification implied by the sorting hypothesis when there are high levels of amenities.
However, the locations involved are recognized as having both high levels of coastal amenities
and high risks of storms and flooding related damage that would be covered by the NFIP. Thus,
it would seem the attraction of the amenities outweighs the risks and that for these cases
affordability may be less of an issue. On the other hand, for other areas (Louisiana) there is
equally consistent evidence implying the risks seem to outweigh any amenity effect of coastal
locations. As a result, it is reasonable to ask whether these patterns are “typical” for different
regions covered by the NFIP and, if so, what do the differences imply for reform of its
affordability mandate?
These differences alone imply that the current NFIP policy which sets insurance rates based
on the dates of flood maps in relationship to the construction date for all homes in all locations
cannot be justified as required to assure affordability of the insurance. The results for these two
Gulf Coast states imply, for example, that in the case of Florida this policy seems to be
subsidizing wealthier households. By contrast, one would not necessarily draw this conclusion
for the case of Louisiana. It is reasonable to ask are these two examples special? We return to
this question in the remainder of the paper. First, we describe, in the next section, why the real
6

A recent report by the US Geological Survey (Covillion et al. [2011]) indicated that 1.2 million acres of land has
been lost in Louisiana between 1992 and 2010 and the majority of the land loss in this report is composed of tidal
wetlands. Recently Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority [2017] released a Master Plan
predicting continued and more significant land loss than previously expected. As part of the Plans’ effort to inform
the public, it includes an interactive online mapping capability (http://cims.coastal.louisiana.gov/masterplan/) that
displays, among other elements, the land change, flood risks, and composition of coastal vegetation in locations
throughout the state. According to this resource, all of the coastal areas of the state are composed of marsh or
wetlands.

6

median income for homeowners, independent of decisions to purchase flood insurance, is an
incidence measure consistent with both Musgrave and Hendren. In developing our remaining
empirical analysis we will confine the modeling to the IRS records because they offer a
consistent income measure and are more uniformly available for all the zip codes we consider.

3. Sorting and Incidence Analysis

a. Background on Sorting
Equilibrium sorting models have their origins in Tiebout’s [1956] description for how
households can select a preferred bundle of local public and private goods by moving. Given that
communities differ in the housing available, employment opportunities, and other local public
goods, these models maintain that a household selects their preferred community and in the
process reveals aspects of their preferences. When household income is assumed exogenous,
housing prices will reflect the effects of local public goods. Epple et al. [1984] demonstrate how
the single crossing property implies income stratification 7. This property describes how the slope
of each indifference curve in the plane defined by a housing price and the measure of local
public goods changes with income. If all households have the same preferences, then increases in
this slope with income will imply positive income stratification.
It is reasonable to assume households may have different tastes for local public goods.
This type of extension has been used to develop strategies for estimating household preferences
based on how the distribution of tastes and income contributes to the degree of stratification 8.
Here we simply consider whether the presence of coastal amenities and storm risks would
change the basic expectations in this type of model. Using a simple expected utility framework
with two outcomes – storm damage reducing income and no storm damage – together with the
assumption that the probability of a storm’s damage increases with the amount of coastal
amenities the composite of amenity and risk does not offer unambiguous predictions. Depending
on the strength of preferences for amenities and the properties we assume for the marginal utility
7

Nechyba [1997] provides a formal demonstration of existence and properties of the equilibrium.
See Sieg et al.[2004] for an example and Kuminoff et al.[2013] for a review of the alternative formulations of
sorting models.

of income it is possible to overturn the income stratification prediction. Appendix A outlines the
logic for this conclusion in formal terms. We find that with other reasonable assumptions the
predictions would be maintained. However, the predictions for market equilibria are not clear (as
we explain below) and the importance of these tendencies will depend on the differences in risk
perceptions across individuals and locations, the heterogeneity in tastes for coastal amenities
(and more generally water based amenities), incomes, as well as market responses. Thus, as one
might expect, there are good reasons that would explain incomplete income stratification.
Unfortunately it is not possible to use the properties of a structural model to fully characterize the
market equilibrium once risk is introduced. This conclusion follows because amenities contribute
to preferences directly and also affect the nature of the risks. Moreover, current flood insurance
policy influences which areas and homes would face the full implications of damages from
storms. The composite of these factors undermines our ability to establish clear expectations for
whether an observed equilibrium would satisfy the ascending bundles property used in
estimating structural models 9. As a result, we propose to describe what can be observed –namely
the income distributions across location and time in areas with coastal or water related amenities
and subject to flood risks compared to nearby areas hypothesized to have comparable conditions
in other respects.

b. Incidence
Our research design combines insights from two earlier contributions. The first of these
by Hendren [2018] considers how the modeling of individual behavior influences the role of
uncertainty in characterizing the willingness to pay for insurance; and the second, by Musgrave
[1959] 60 years ago provides a general equilibrium definition of the incidence of policies on the
distribution of income. Musgrave’s definition for incidence provides a straightforward strategy
for evaluating the relevance of the affordability goal in the setting of rates under the National
Flood Insurance Program. His framework would measure incidence of a policy through the
change in the distribution of real income as a result of that action. It recognizes that policy,
whether involving taxes, subsidies, public expenditures, or regulations have effects on

estimation of the vertical form of these models.

8

individuals through changes in the amounts and sources of their income as well as through
changes in the relative prices. These prices affect each household’s expenditures on market
goods and services as well as their labor-leisure choices and, at a market level, are determined by
the composite of all these responses. Thus, his assessment of the incidence of a policy requires
consideration of the net effects of all of these adjustments after it has been implemented so that
they are captured in the resulting distribution of real income.
We will use this concept of incidence a bit differently here. We evaluate the income
distributions for households directly affected by the risks associated with their location in coastal
or shoreline zip codes (or in zip codes associated with Special Flood Hazard Areas that adjoin
the source for the flooding risk -- either a river or lake if these locations are not coastal areas).
These distributions are then compared to adjacent (interior) zip codes. We do not distinguish
policyholders from non-policyholders. Following Hendren’s argument, using the choice to have
insurance as part of the criteria used to select the households considered in judging affordability
amounts to accepting the household choices that affect what is actually at risk. While Hendren’s
argument is associated with measuring the willingness to pay for insurance, it is also relevant to
an analysis of incidence. That is, when people have some knowledge of the risk they face before
the insurance decision, then in his case their willingness to pay for insurance will typically be
less than in cases without that information 10. The same is true in judging incidence. Once a
decision is made to purchase insurance, the policyholder knows the financial consequences of
flooding.
In our case, people have accepted an implicit amenity/risk trade-off in selecting a place to
live. They do not know if a storm will actually damage their properties. This situation is the
analog to his example of a cancer patient’s willingness to pay for insurance compared to
someone’s value for insurance before knowing her health state. Our estimates for the income
distributions include policyholders and non-policyholders in different locations. As a result, they
deal with incidence for households who have accepted different risks. This conclusion follows
from our design which distinguishes them based on their locations. The households do not know
what the damage they might experience for any particular storm. By comparing distributions
across locations with different risks we evaluate whether the incidence is differentially imposed
10

Hendren [2018] makes this point in footnote #1 and attributes it to Hirshleifer [1971].

9

on those less able to afford insurance. In this respect, then, it is a measure of incidence that
attempts to construct an analog reflecting the concerns raised by Hendren’s proposed adaptation
of measures of the willingness to pay for insurance.
c. NFIP Subsidies
Federal flood insurance under the NFIP is available to homeowners and communities that
agree to enact local floodplain ordinances and building codes. Homes built before 1968 or before
a flood insurance rate map was completed (pre-FIRM) are eligible for subsidized insurance. This
process means that homes eligible for the subsidy in the high risk zones V and A face a
chargeable rate for insurance that is significantly below the NFIP’s risk based rate 11.
Communities voluntarily join the program. To join they must adopt a set of minimum
floodplain management regulations associated with the 100 year flood risk designation. With
community participation, the NFIP creates flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and sets rates.
These maps describe the floodplain in each community and the associated risks. FEMA has
developed these maps for more than 20,000 communities. Rural areas with low levels of
development have maps that are constructed with approximate methods that show an outline of
areas where a flood has at least a one percent annual risk. Detailed maps are made for areas with
higher levels of development. They use a variety of models that take account of drainage area,
flood durations, structures, amount of impermeable surface, etc. Nonetheless, the process is not
forward-looking. It does not attempt to anticipate changes in the risks faced in these areas due to
climate change or likely future modifications to land uses that would affect flood risks.
When the annual base flood risk is one percent or higher for a location, the area is
designated a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). For communities that are or have participated
in the NFIP, homeowners in a mapped SFHA are required to purchase flood insurance as a
condition for receiving a federally backed mortgage. After the first year of a mortgage the
compliance with this requirement has not been closely monitored. 12 The rates for NFIP insurance

The insurance rate under the subsidy system is called the chargeable rate. It is a flat rate across all structures,
risk zones, and communities. See Szmurlo [2018] for more details.
12
Michel-Kerjan, de Forges and Kunreuther [2012] estimate, using 2001 data that by 2009 only about 20% of the
NFIP policies remained in place. These policies were acquired for a federally backed mortgage. The attrition was
higher in Florida and Louisiana with declines to under 20% by 2008.
11

10

are the same across the country for the areas with the same risk zone designations defined based
on each location’s FIRM.
In 2012 Congress recognized the need for reform in the rates for the NFIP and passed the
Biggert Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act. The core principle of this
legislation was to move the NFIP toward a risk-based set of premiums “… that better reflected
expected losses from floods at insured properties” 13. This revision eliminated pricing at
subsidized rates (the pre-FIRM rates) and grandfathering. Unfortunately, as the recent National
Research Council [2015] report on the NFIP program indicated, shortly after its passage, a large
number of communities expressed concerns with this legislation. Their concerns related to the
effects of the new higher insurance rates on home prices and on the program’s goal of expanding
the take-up rates for flood insurance. As a result, in 2014, Congress passed the Homeowner
Flood Insurance Affordability Act which changed the process associated with removing preFIRM subsidized rates and reinstated grandfathering.
This legislation also directed FEMA to develop an affordability framework that proposed
“programmatic and regulatory changes that address the affordability of flood insurance” (FEMA
[2018], p.2). Section 9 of the legislation proposed five criteria for this assessment:
1.

Accurate communication to consumers of the flood risk associated with their

properties;
2.

Targeted assistance to flood insurance policyholders based on their financial

ability to continue their participation in the NFIP;
3.

Individual or community actions that mitigate or lower the cost of flood

insurance;
4.

The impact of increases in risk premium rates upon participation in the NFIP;

5.

The impact flood insurance rate map updates will have on the affordability of

flood insurance.

13

National Research Council [2015] p.51

11

Unfortunately the fifth element in these criteria appears to assume affordability requires
adjusting rates for all homeowners in high risk areas whenever there are new or revised FIRMs.
Our findings, as previewed in section 2, confirm that this “blanket” approach is the wrong
strategy for addressing affordability as a means to allow households to more easily adapt to new
information about the flood risks they may face.

4. Data and Model
There are two components of the samples we use in evaluating the incidence of flood risks
for different income groups and gauge the relevance of the NFIP’s affordability criteria. The first
includes all Gulf Coast, shoreline zip codes in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Texas. We also added the Atlantic coast of Florida as another high risk area. We match the zip
codes to the interior zip codes with adjacent boundaries to these coastal locations. We assembled
the IRS administrative data providing zip code tabulations for the adjusted gross income from
2009 to 2016 for those returns that took the mortgage interest deduction as a proxy for
homeownership. This period was selected because 2016 is the most recent year reported and in
the years prior to 2009 the reports altered the income distributions used to define the conditional
income distributions. In 2008, the tabulations did not report the counts for the returns taking the
mortgage interest deduction.
The second component of our sample uses a set of zip codes providing a broader
representation of areas subject to flood risks adjoining other types of water resources that are
included in SFHA’s. To develop this sample of communities that meet the needs of our incidence
analysis, we use an early study of compliance with the building requirements associated with the
NFIP by Mathis and Nicholson [2006]. In 2002, under contract from FEMA, the American
Institute for Research (AIR) sought to assess the percentage of post-FIRM buildings with and
without flood insurance in SFHAs that were in compliance with floodplain management
regulations. To develop this assessment the report selected 10 cluster areas. They were:
Washington/Baltimore (Loudoun Co., VA)

Coastal North Carolina (Dare Co., NC)

Florida West Coast (Tampa, FL)*

Mid-Atlantic (New Castle Co., DE)

12

Florida Panhandle (Escambia Co., FL)* Northern California (Contra Costa Co., CA)
Louisiana (New Orleans, LA)*

Mississippi River (St. Louis, MO)

Coastal Texas (Galveston, TX)*

Southwest (Maricopa Co., AZ)

For our analysis here we omit areas that overlap with the Gulf Coast (indicated in the list
above with an asterisk). For each of these clusters, AIR delineated communities within a 100
mile radius of each cluster’s central node. They were screened using FEMA’s information
system to identify those locations with a detailed FIRM 14. This analysis was further refined to
select communities with a significant number of buildings built after January 1, 1990 to allow
sampling for the compliance study. We did not impose this last restriction on our sample and
instead used all the communities who participated in the NFIP with detailed FIRM maps and
were identified as having areas with SFHAs in 2003. Our data do not provide a balanced panel
(eight yearly observations for each zip code) for all areas included. For some years, the IRS does
not report tabulations for some zip codes. Maricopa County, Arizona has the largest number of
these incomplete zip codes. Illinois and Maryland also have at least one zip code with a missing
year 15.
Table 1 summaries all the communities considered in the AIR analysis. Column one lists the
number of communities in each cluster. As we noted, we used all the communities for clusters
that did not overlap with the Gulf Coast sample. Within each community, we assembled the zip
code areas and classified them based on their relationship to a water source (i.e. coastal area,
river, or lake). We identified those with a shoreline boundary within the zip code, those interior
zip code that adjoin the zip codes with shoreline boundaries. We also selected a set of interior zip
codes separated from the shoreline zip codes by at least one adjoining zip code area. These are
labeled “nearby”. For the adjacent zip codes, our sample allows the analysis of each type of
water body to be conducted separately because the adjacent zip codes are distinguished by water
See Appendix A in Mathis and Nicholson [2006] for a complete listing. Supplemental material in the form of Excel
worksheets report the specific zip codes for the areas in each state that were used as part of our analysis.
15
This was confirmed with Ms. Emily Gross of IRS Statistics of Income Division (11/26/2018). Her e-mail explained
that the IRS Disclosure Protection Procedures likely implied that the zip code did not meet the minimum number of
returns for that year.

body type. For the other zip codes we do not attempt to “attach” them to a specific waterbody.
They are “nearby” but a formal definition of proximity given the size of the spatial units and the
geographic expanse of the water resources would be somewhat arbitrary. Thus, to evaluate the
effects of geography, we focus on states with only one type of waterbody to consider the effects
of comparing our estimates for median incomes for shoreline zip codes versus other “nearby”
locations.
These types of distinctions may be especially important for the flood zones that are not along
the coast. In these cases, the geography of local floodplains, as well as the spatial distribution of
landscape amenities likely affects the relative impact of the amenity/risk trade-off and the
incidence of flood policy. Unfortunately, the spatial resolution of the IRS data does not allow us
to distinguish these effects at a finer spatial scale. Earlier analysis (Kahn and Smith [2018]) used
HMDA data for all Gulf Coast states at the county and zip code levels. Both analyses were
consistent with the results using the IRS income tabulations. The IRS administrative records data
provide the more reliable measures of income. As a result, we confine our summary here to the
IRS records. Real income uses the national CPI (for urban households) and presents all income
measures in 2015 dollars.
Our test is conducted by considering each state separately and pooling our estimates for the
real median income across the zip codes in each community over time. We allow the treatment to
enter our simple model in two separate ways –a more restrictive form that assumes the effect of
the increased risk associated with a shoreline location is constant over time and a specification
that allows it to vary. Equation (1) provides the more general model. The restrictive version
replaces the interaction terms with a single fixed effect identifying the shoreline zip codes. Our
test for the general case evaluates the joint null hypothesis that the coefficients for these
interaction terms are all simultaneously zero for all time periods (𝑖𝑖. 𝑒𝑒. 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 = 0 for all t)
represented in our sample.
(1)

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑡𝑡 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙(𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + ∑𝑡𝑡 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙(𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝐶𝐶(𝑖𝑖)𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where: 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the measure of the income distribution in year t for zip code i;

14

𝑙𝑙(𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator variable =1 when the estimated measure of the income distribution for

year t and zip code i corresponds to year t and 0 otherwise (i.e. a dummy variable for the year of
the application).
𝐶𝐶(𝑖𝑖)𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator variable =1 when the estimated measure for the income distribution for

zip code i corresponds to one with shoreline of a water resource (ocean, river or lake) and 0
otherwise (i.e. a dummy variable identifying the areas with shoreline).
𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a random error

For all the states with coastal or resource specific (i.e. rivers or lakes) designations for the
SFHAs flood zones, each of our tests is conducted using the adjacent zip codes as the control
locations. For Arizona, Maryland, Missouri, Virginia, and West Virginia, with only one type of
water body potentially responsible for flooding, we consider two alternative definitions for the
control zip codes – adjacent and interior, “nearby” zip codes. We hypothesize that in these cases
the differences in the sources of flood risk and the associated topography may impact the
reliability of adjacent zip codes as controls. This simple alternative definition is roughly similar
to the more careful logic of the “doughnut” approach to defining instruments in other spatial
analyses of household choices of residential locations (see Bayer et al. [2016]).

5. Results
Tables 2 and 3 summarize our primary findings. In Table 2 we present our analysis for the
Gulf Coast states and the Atlantic coast of Florida. The first column of estimates reports the test
of the joint null hypothesis that all shoreline interaction coefficients are zero and the second a
test when these effects are treated as constant over time. Figures 1 thru 3 plot the estimated
coefficients for the shoreline and adjacent zip codes from the model that allows the effect of
shoreline to vary over time. After that in the second column, we report also the estimated income
difference between shoreline and interior adjacent zip codes when the estimated effect is
assumed constant. In parentheses below each estimate we report the p-value for the test of
significance. Three of the six estimated difference in medians are significant. Of these, two are
positive for the Florida Coast and one negative for Louisiana, as we noted in section 2.

15

The remaining six columns in the table relate to separate models for the income classes used
to estimate the medians. Each column reports the test for a separate model using the proportion
of returns in each income category as the dependent variable and testing the joint null hypothesis
that the coefficients for the interaction terms with the shoreline dummy variable and year fixed
effects are simultaneously zero. The definitions for the IRS income bins remain unchanged from
2009 to 2016. The models (i.e. separate effects of shoreline by year, constant effect of shoreline
for all years, and the count measures for income bins) for coastal zip codes in Florida,
considering the Gulf and the Atlantic coasts, generally provide strong support the hypothesis of
positive income stratification. Only one model, for the lowest income bin, fails to reject the null
hypothesis of no association with the Gulf Coast and two with the Atlantic coast of Florida. By
contrast, Louisiana’s models indicate significant negative income stratification. These tests
simply mirror what we reported at the outset in section 2 with figures 1, 2, and 3. As noted
above, these figures plot the estimated coefficients by year for shoreline and adjacent interior zip
codes using the medians derived from the IRS tabulations. The difference in real median income
is comparable in absolute magnitude for Florida and Louisiana. In the case of Florida Gulf
shoreline zip codes, the difference is $12,545 higher for the real median income associated with
the shoreline zip codes while for Louisiana the shoreline zip codes have real median incomes
that are $12,960 less those that are interior and adjacent.
The models using shares of the returns in each of the income bins rely on nominal incomes
for each bin. Because the micro records are confidential, we cannot convert the intervals into real
terms and re-bin the records. As noted, for Florida and Louisiana the results using the income
bins are generally consistent with those for the medians suggesting shifts in the income
distributions toward higher incomes for shoreline locations in Florida and higher incomes for the
interior adjacent locations in Louisiana. Two of the other Gulf States (Alabama and Mississippi)
do not reveal any significant patterns. Plots of their estimated shoreline and adjacent interior
coefficients are provided in Appendix B. The results for Texas indicate significant differences in
the share of returns for lowest (under $25,000) and the highest income (over $200,000) bins. The
Gulf Coasts in Florida and Texas include well recognized coastal amenities that are significant

16

recreational resources 16. The situation is less clear for Louisiana 17 and somewhat more mixed for
Alabama and Mississippi.
Overall then, our analysis of the Gulf Coast states provides only limited support for income
stratification. It suggests based on the Gulf Coast of Florida with clear coastal amenities the
incidence of insurance subsidies is likely to be tilted to wealthier households. The same
judgement would apply for the Atlantic coast of Florida. In the case of Louisiana, the flood
risk/insurance situation is more complex because of the geography involved. Kousky and Lingle
[2018] identify Jefferson Parish Louisiana for example is one of the counties with more than
100,000 residential flood insurance policies 18. This parish includes both shoreline and adjacent
zip codes. Some of the shoreline areas in Louisiana are coastal wetlands and don’t have zip
codes. Thus, our evidence indicating higher median incomes for interior zip codes is more
difficult to interpret within the reduced form framework of our model.
The second component of our sample, designed to match the Mathis and Nicholson national
sample of communities in SFHAs, was selected to offer more resolution on whether the diversity
in results observed for the Gulf States applies to all of the regions covered by the NFIP. Table 3
summarizes these results. We report tests for each state and type of resource with flood risks that
are identified here as zip codes with shoreline locations (ocean, lake, and river resources). The
results for four separate models are presented in the table. Columns one and two identify the
state and type of resource. Columns three and five provide the test results for the flexible
specification allowing the shoreline effect to change with the year in three and the constant effect
across years in column five. When the estimated difference between shoreline and adjacent zip
codes for the constant effect model is significant, we report the magnitude of the difference in
real median income between shoreline and adjacent interior zip codes in column four.
Fourteen of the nineteen potential estimates using the constant effect of a shoreline
specification are significant. They are evenly divided between situations indicating positive

stratification (7 models – California/river, Delaware/ocean, Maryland/ocean, New Jersey/ocean,
New York/ocean, New York/river, and Pennsylvania/lake) compared to negative stratification (7
models –Arizona/river, California/ocean, Delaware/river, Illinois/river, North Carolina/ocean,
North Carolina/river, and Virginia/river).
Understanding the reasons for these different results would require a detailed evaluation of
the specific attributes of each community and areas adjoining the flood zone areas. This is
beyond our scope here 19. These findings do confirm our basic argument. Household behavior in
choosing where to live affects the residential component of the damages. In some cases the
attraction of the amenities is sufficient to outweigh the risks of flooding. In others, the reverse is
at work. So a judgment about the need for subsidized flood insurance rates based on geography
or the age of a structure does not fit the income distributions we observe in a national sample of
communities with SFHA. Efforts to assure affordable rates need to be based on the
circumstances of each household. This strategy would also allow the insurance rates to serve one
of their intended roles – as signals of the risks associated with locating in flood prone areas.
To evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the selection of control zip codes we also
considered a different comparative standard when the location responsible for flooding risk was
associated with only one type of resource. These results are for Arizona, Maryland, Missouri,
Virginia, and West Virginia. In these cases the control zip code is not the adjacent location. We
select locations separated by at least the adjacent zip code. They are in the state and close to the
zip codes that are closest to the source of the flood risk. We have labeled them as “nearby”. This
strategy is an approximate attempt to parallel the use of a “doughnut” structure that has served as
an effective strategy in defining instruments in the estimation of sorting models. Column seven,
eight and nine report these estimates for the flexible and constant effect models. In the cases of
Arizona (Maricopa County) and Virginia our general conclusions would be comparable to what
was learned using the adjacent zip codes as controls. Both indicate lower incomes in areas close
to the risk. The magnitude of the estimated constant differential varies with the control selected.
For Arizona the difference is larger and for Virginia it is smaller in absolute magnitude. For
Maryland and West Virginia the results reverse the judgement about the direction of

stratification with the selection of the control and the statistical support for a differential is
stronger.
We don’t want to over interpret these differences. Zip codes are defined by the postal service
for one set of objectives. There are many spatial boundaries that can be used as proxy measures
for services conveyed to households because of their locations. Local communities have different
public services and tax rates; school districts can affect the conditions of access to different types
of schools; sub-divisions and HOAs also affect what homeowners have access to and are
expected to pay for. So comparisons across zip codes don’t allow us to control these other
dimensions. Indeed, when we consider all of these details it is remarkable that the effects of
sorting are so clear-cut in the coastal locations as well as in some of the other SFHA locations.
Given the aggregate nature of our data source (IRS tabulations) and the limited ability to
exercise spatial control due to confidentiality limitations on our ability to isolate below the zip
code level, we conclude that these results offer compelling support for recognizing how spatial

sorting can influence the incidence of policies to provide affordable flood insurance that are
defined based on location and age of a structure rather than on income. In the next section, we
discussed how these findings contrast with the existing literature and why the differences in our
result are important to reforming the NFIP.

6. Discussion
Previous research on the welfare impacts of policy changes and how they are evaluated
emphasizes two points: (a) the importance of accounting for behavioral responses to a change in
policy and the role of income and substitution effects in influencing the marginal willingness to
pay for the “full” incremental costs of what is being evaluated (Hendren [2016]); and (b) the
implications of how behavioral decisions affect the risk actually experienced for policies
involving subsidies or mandates for insurance (Hendren [2018]). We argued that the same
concerns arise in judgments being made about the affordability of flood insurance. Musgrave
anticipated the importance of behavior in proposing what amounts to a general equilibrium
perspective in judging the incidence of policies. That is, he wanted measures of income
distributions before and after a policy change was made in order to judge incidence. His

19

reasoning was not as fully developed as what Hendren offers in his discussion of what he labels
as the “policy elasticity”, but the connection is direct.
Judgments about affordability of flood insurance should take this ex ante perspective. In
evaluating the incidence of any benefits attributed to assuring affordable insurance rates to
protect against floods we want to know the income distribution for those households who could
face flood risks. This perspective is important in judging the affordability of rates. A subsidized
set of insurance rates policy affects both where they locate and whether they purchase insurance.
Of course, defining a counterfactual that is consistent with an ex ante perspective is a tall order,
especially in the face of a continuously changing landscape of policy and storm events. One way
to address these issues is with a structural model for the sorting behavior of households. Recently
Walls et al. [2018] have used a simulation framework with an agent-based model to evaluate
who would bear the effects of increased storm frequency in a setting that is parameterized to
mimic the mid-Atlantic region of the US. Their framework assumes agents are risk neutral and
trade-off expected damage, coastal amenities, and housing costs. In this setting, price effects
induce poor households to locate in high risk areas. With changes in their model’s parameters or
how they treat storm related damages, we should expect very different results 20.
We adopted an empirical perspective and take advantage of the variations in geography to
characterize the counterfactuals in our analysis of incidence. By considering eight years of
experience that overlap hurricanes and flooding events in risk prone areas we allow for changes
that should lead households to update their perceptions of risks. We do not attempt to distinguish
policyholders from non-policyholders and only identify households likely to be eligible for flood
insurance through our focus on those claiming the mortgage interest deduction.
Our approach which focuses on eligibility for insurance and exposure to risk contrasts with
all the past evaluations of affordability. The past analyses have largely focused on the
distinctions between policyholders and non-policyholders. These evaluations overlook the
importance of Hendren’s [2018] argument 21. The behavioral choice of insurance affects what is
actually at risk for each type of household –those choosing to purchase insurance and those who
The simple outline of the effects of single crossing assumption in our expected utility model in Appendix A is one
example of how these changes could influence their findings. Our unambiguous reduced form results supporting
positive income stratification for coastal locations in Florida is another.

20

do not. As a result, it will affect any judgment about the incidence of these policies for different
income groups. An ex ante perspective for judging incidence and affordability requires we
consider the income distributions for households under conditions that ignore their insurance
status in an attempt to mimic the situation before these choices are made. Our analysis of
aggregate records that does not distinguish those who have flood insurance policies is one way
to meet this objective
Some examples of the recent literature attempting to address affordability illustrate the
potential problems. The new FEMA study created a unique database for assessing affordability
by linking the NFIP policy information with household income and housing cost information
from the American Community Survey (ACS). The 4.5 million active NFIP policy holders as of
2015 were matched by identity to the ACS households in the survey for that year. Over 64,000
matches were developed. Using census weights, the report compares incomes of policy holders
to non-policy holders inside and outside SFHAs. The design of the FEMA affordability analysis
is directly tied to the structure of the NFIP. Table 4 here reproduces Table 2.6 from the report. It
compares median income by housing tenure, mortgage status, policy status, and location (i.e.
inside and outside SFHAs). The median incomes are lower inside SFHAs regardless of the
tenure and policy status compared to those outside. However, for those without mortgages,
where there is no requirement to purchase insurance, the median income difference is relatively
small. It appears more substantial with aggregation. For example, elsewhere in the report (taken
from Table 2.3) when households are aggregated over tenure and mortgage status the difference
in median incomes for policy holders and non-policy holders is more dramatic –77k for policy
holders and 40k for non-policy holders inside SFHAs. The “take away” message of this
assessment appears to be that once again lower income households face higher flood risks.
All of the other past efforts also confound distinct issues. These issues amount to
different types of selection effects as to who is in and out of the sub-samples being evaluated.
For example, another recent study by Bin et al. [2017] examined premiums to coverage and
claims to coverage at the zip code level. These data were summarized in comparison to summary
statistics for census tract income also summarized to the zip code level. Their analysis finds that
premiums per unit of coverage decline with income. However, they are cautious in interpreting
these findings and conclude calling for the need to consider the relationship between income and

21

the receipt of a pre-FIRM price discount. More specifically they note: “We are unable to
determine with this data, however, whether this is because higher income zip codes are less risky
on average than lower zip codes, so they are able to purchase more coverage for the same price,
or if this finding is driven by correlations between income and pre-FIRM discounts or other
pricing structures of the NFIP” (Bin et al [2017] p.6).
Our analysis finds that judgments about affordability of flood insurance are more
nuanced than either the popular accounts of subsidizing millionaires or these the FEMA concern
that poor households are driven by housing costs to opt out of safe locations into areas prone to
flood risks and without place based subsidies could not afford insurance. Households’ behavior
in response to coastal amenities, risk, and local housing markets, together with current policy,
lead in some areas (notably the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of Florida, coastal locations in New
Jersey, and both coastal and river locations in New York) to outcomes where current policy
might be judged as providing subsidies to higher income households. In other cases, however,
such as the coastal locations in California, North Carolina, as well as the shoreline along rivers
identified as SFHA in Delaware, and Virginia, the lower income households are indeed in the
higher flood risk areas. These findings did not require the assumptions associated with a formal
structural model of sorting behavior and are robust across model specifications.
7. Summary and Implications
After the National Flood Insurance Program’s authorization expired in 2017, the program
received several short-term extensions. The current temporary reauthorization has the program
expiring in May 2019. FEMA’s fourth quarterly Watermark report noted a goal that the NFIP
will transform, over time, to a more fiscally sustainable program and expand the private market
for insurance. In the interim, the agency has recommended that Congress authorized the NFIP to
establish a means-tested affordability program that allows low income policyholders to maintain
discounted rates. The report is not specific about what the rates would be in high risk areas
compared to those for others. Concerns about the transition between the current system and one
where rates reflect actuarial conditions have in the past prompted the continuation of subsidies.
Our results support an approach that is directed at requiring affordability based rates to be linked
to a means test using the income levels to evaluate those households judged as eligible. To our
knowledge, our assessment offers the most comprehensive evaluation of the incidence of the

22

NFIP to date, both in terms of the geographic scale of the coverage of flood related resources,
and the time span considered. We found that there are clear patterns of positive income
stratification in some regions where the amenity levels likely outweigh the flood risks. Coastal
locations in Florida, New Jersey, and New York seem consistent with the predictions of a
Tiebout sorting model in attracting higher income households. So insurance subsidies under the
current NFIP system based on place and timing of construction of houses would tend to favor
these high income groups. At the same time, we find the program in other areas would benefit
some lower income households. Thus, if one of the program’s goals is to assure affordability
through subsidies, this objective requires targeting with a means test for eligibility.

Appendix A

The purpose of this Appendix is to summarize one approach to explaining how the single crossing property would imply
income stratification within an expected utility framework. We assume a household can be represented with a single preference
function.
Let 𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞) be the household’s indirect utility function with p the rental price of housing, m household income and q a
measure of coastal or water based amenities. We assume other prices are fixed and thus omit them from the function. The function is
also assumed to well behaved, derived from a quasi-concave direct utility function assuming utility maximization subject to a budget
constraint. In a sorting model, households select a community based on housing prices and local public goods. So that in these
applications p and q would be indexed by community.
We use a static framework and assume the probability of flood damage is 𝜋𝜋. The effects of a flood are assumed to lead to
income loss, represented here as D. This treatment is an important restriction. Our objective here is simply is illustrate one way in
which sorting could lead to income stratification. Modifying the assumptions for how flood damage affects preferences or introducing
parameters to allow for differences in tastes (see Sieg et al.[2004]) would imply incomplete stratification. And this is one of the
primary motivations for the empirical analysis in this paper. Our goal here is to illustrate what would be needed for a structural model
that would be consistent with tendencies for income stratification.

Expected utility is given as follows:
(1) 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 = 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)
The maintained assumptions underlying our analysis imply that selecting a coastal location (or near a water body subject to flooding)
for the water based amenities increases the risk of flood related damage. To introduce this logic into the model we assume the
probability of damage is a function of q. This treatment implies (1) can be re-written as:

38

(2) 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 = 𝜋𝜋(𝑞𝑞)𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + �1 − 𝜋𝜋(𝑞𝑞)�𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)

The single crossing property in this setting asks how the tradeoff between p and q, along a constant expected utility locus (and thus in
ex ante terms) changes with income. In terms of this simple framework this is given by:

(3)

𝜕𝜕

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

𝜕𝜕

𝐸𝐸𝑈𝑈𝑞𝑞

� � = 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 (− 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 )

𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

We develop this expression step by step.

𝑝𝑝

(4𝑎𝑎) 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑞𝑞 = 𝜋𝜋 ′ 𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) − 𝜋𝜋 ′ 𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞) + 𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞)
+ (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)

(4𝑏𝑏) 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑝𝑝 = 𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)
𝜕𝜕

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

So 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ) in the ex ante case can be expressed as follows:
(𝜋𝜋 ′ �𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) − 𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)� + 𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)
−
𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)

39

(𝜋𝜋 ′ �𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) − 𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)� + 𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)) ∗ (𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞))
+
(𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞))2
The sign of these terms could be positive or negative, depending on plausible assumptions. More specifically, consider the first
expression, the denominator is negative and we would expect the terms in the numerator are likely to have the same signs -(𝜋𝜋 ′ �𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) − 𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)� is likely positive (diminishing marginal utility of income) and 𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 −
𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞) is positive. So the overall sign (including the leading negative sign) is positive. The second expression has a positive
denominator. The first term in the numerator ((𝜋𝜋 ′ �𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) − 𝑉𝑉(𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)�) is negative. The second term (𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) +
(1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)) ∗ (𝜋𝜋𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐷𝐷, 𝑞𝑞) + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑞𝑞)) is positive for normal goods. That is, assuming 𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 > 0. As a
result, we need to consider first whether the second term is negative and then the net effect. If it is negative we need to consider the
size of this effect in relationship to the first term to assess whether the single crossing property holds. It depends on the relative
magnitude of these effects.
