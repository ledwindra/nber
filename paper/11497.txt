Are There Real Effects of Licensing on Academic Research? A Life Cycle View

JEL No. D9, J2, O3
ABSTRACT
Whether financial returns to university licensing divert faculty from basic research is examined in
a life cycle context. As in traditional life cycle models, faculty devote more time to research, which
can be either basic or applied, early and more time to leisure as they age. Licensing has real effects
by increasing the ratio of applied to basic effort and reducing leisure throughout the life cycle, but
basic research need not suffer. When applied effort adds nothing to the stock of knowledge, licensing
reduces research output, but if applied effort leads to publishable output as well as licenses, then
research output and the stock of knowledge are higher with licensing than without. When tenure is
added to the system, licensing has a positive effect on research output except when the incentives
to license are very high.

A prominent issue in the debates over faculty involvement in university licensing
is whether financial incentives associated with licensing have diverted faculty from
basic toward applied research (Stephan and Levin 1996). Available evidence is limited and provides mixed results. Lach and Schankerman (2003) provide empirical
support for the view that invention activity, as measured by invention disclosures,
is positively related to the share of license income accruing to faculty.1 Thursby
and Thursby (2002, 2007) provide support for the view that increased disclosure
activity is more reflective of an increased willingness of faculty to engage in commercial activity than a change in research profile. Their study of faculty in six
major research universities shows that over the last two decades, the probability
a faculty member will disclose an invention has increased tenfold, while research
productivity has remained roughly constant. In essence, despite the importance of
the issue, we know little about the eﬀect of faculty involvement in licensing on the
nature of research.
In this paper, we construct several life cycle models of faculty behavior that
allow us to examine this and related issues. In the models we consider, the faculty
member faces a fixed teaching load and chooses the amount of time to devote to
research (which can be either basic or applied) and the amount of time to take
as leisure. We model both the puzzle solving and financial motives for the faculty
member to conduct research, and we consider her behavior with and without the
possibility of licensing. This allows us to examine the eﬀect of licensing on the
research mix, as well as the total amount of time working, throughout the life
cycle. We also examine the eﬀect of the tenure decision on the type of research
conducted with and without the possibility of licensing.
We show that, with or without licensing, and with or without a tenure system,
the faculty member devotes more time to research early in her career, so that
leisure rises over time. In that sense, licensing does not alter the life cycle pattern.
We show that there are, nonetheless, real eﬀects of licensing since it yields a higher
ratio of applied to basic eﬀort and lower leisure throughout the life cycle. Thus, as
suggested by Lach and Schankerman (2003), faculty respond to economic incentives
Importantly, however, this diversion does not mean that research is compromised.
In our models, leisure is the activity most compromised, so that total research eﬀort
rises; and in most of the models we consider, basic eﬀort rises with the introduction
of licensing.

When a faculty member believes he or she has an invention with commercial potential they
file a formal disclosure of the invention to their university’s technology transfer oﬃce. This
disclosure is the first step in licensing.

The implications of licensing for research output and the stock of knowledge
depend, not only on the eﬀect on applied and basic eﬀort but also on whether
applied eﬀort contributes to the stock of knowledge. We show that the worst case
scenario is where the applied eﬀort involved with licensing is pure development and
adds nothing to the stock of knowledge. If, however, the applied eﬀort involved in
licensing leads to publishable output as well as licenses, then the outlook is more
favorable. In this case, we show that research output and the stock of knowledge
are generally higher with licensing than without. The exception to this is when a
tenure system is in place and the incentives to license are very high.
In Section 1, we discuss prior work in this area and how this paper contributes.
Section 2 presents the basic model. Section 3 presents life cycle behavior for three
diﬀerent scenarios: a development model in which only basic eﬀort contributes to
the stock of knowledge; a complements model in which basic and applied eﬀorts
are complements in the production of both research and licenses; and a model in
which basic and applied eﬀort are substitutes in research production. Section 4
presents results when tenure is introduced to the model, and Section 5 concludes.

Prior Art

This research is related to prior work in the economics of science, life cycle behavior,
and university-industry technology transfer. While several studies in these areas
examine faculty research, their relevance to the current debates is limited since all
but a few abstract from licensing.

1.1

The Economics of Science

Recent work in the economics of science focuses on the economic implications of
scientific reward systems. In her recent survey, Stephan (1996) points out that this
work owes much to sociologists and historians of science for demonstrating the importance scientists attach to solving puzzles and to being the “first” to solve them
(Hagstrom 1965, Kuhn 1970, and Merton 1957). Levin and Stephan (1991) incorporate the love of puzzle-solving into a life-cycle model in which scientists choose
how to split work eﬀort between research and other income-earning activities. A
“taste” for science also plays a major role in Stern’s (2004) empirical analysis of
wages oﬀered to Ph.D. biologists. Dasgupta and David (1987, 1994) focus on the
eﬃciency aspects of a “priority-based” system in which all rewards go to the first to
discover a result. While this system results in duplication of research and multiple
3

discoveries (Dasgupta and Maskin 1987, Merton 1973), it also creates incentives
for scientists to share information freely and quickly. This is in contrast to the
industrial world where there are strong incentives to restrict the flow of knowledge.
As scientists become more entrepreneurial, it is natural to wonder if science will
suﬀer (Dasgupta and David 1987, Nelson 1992, and Stephan and Levin 1996).
The study most relevant to ours is that of Levin and Stephan (1991). In their
model, scientists engage in research for two reasons: their love of puzzle solving
and as an investment in future earnings. While the investment motive declines
over the life cycle, the utility or joy from solving puzzles does not. In their model,
research productivity at any stage is higher the greater a scientist’s “taste” for
research, and while research productivity declines over the life cycle, the profile is
flatter the greater the taste for science.
We construct a life cycle model that is similar in that faculty derive utility from
research but diﬀers in the types of research that can be done and the financial
rewards to research. In Levin and Stephan, faculty earn a university salary which
at any point in time is positively related to the portion of time spent teaching and
the stock of publications. Thus, time spent on research reduces current earnings
but increases future earnings as in other investment models of human capital.
By contrast, we allow research to increase both current and future earnings as in
“experience” models of human capital in which individuals accumulate knowledge
in their time spent working. Moreover, faculty can do either (or both) basic and
applied research, and when research has an applied component, faculty earn license
income.2

1.2

University-Industry Technology Transfer

Empirical evidence on university-industry interaction and faculty research is mixed
both in focus and results. Some studies suggest that applied research increased in
the post Bayh-Dole era (Cohen et al. 1998, Morgan et al. 1997, Rahm 1994)
while others point to a long history of such research (Mowery and Ziedonis 2002,
Mowery et al. 1999, Rosenberg and Nelson 1994). Cohen et al.’s (1998) survey of
university-industry research centers (UIRCs) provides evidence of countervailing
eﬀects of industry collaboration on faculty productivity, with so-called commercial
outputs of research increasing and publications decreasing (except in biotechnology). Given the importance of publications for industrial productivity (Adams
2

See Killingsworth (1982) for a theoretical review and synthesis of the investment in training
and learning by doing (experience) models of human capital accumulation.

4

1990), these results are cause for concern. By contrast, Mansfield (1995), Zucker et
al. (1994, 1998), Stephan et al. (2003), and Murray (2002) find a complementary
relationship between research productivity and commercial activity. Mansfield’s
(1995) study of 321 academic researchers found that faculty frequently worked
on basic problems suggested by their industrial consulting. Similarly, Zucker et
al. (1994, 1998) found that the most productive scientists in biotechnology often
start new enterprises while continuing research in their academic appointments. In
the case of tissue engineering, Stephan et al. (2003) and Murray (2002) examine
patent and publication data showing that research results are both patented and
published.
The bulk of this literature abstracts from the relationship between licensing
and faculty research. Not surprisingly, however, the few studies that focus on
licensing also provide mixed results. Lach and Schankerman (2002) find a positive
relationship between invention disclosures and the share of license revenue accruing
to inventors. While they interpret this as showing the responsiveness of research
to financial incentives associated with licensing, we argue that disclosures show
the faculty’s willingness to engage in licensing and may or may not reflect changes
in research agendas. Thursby and Thursby (2002) examine whether the growth in
university licensing is driven by an unobservable change in the propensity of faculty
and administrators to engage in license activity. They find that changes in the
direction of research are relatively less important than increases in the propensity
of administrators to license inventions and in business reliance on external R&D.
However, these data are not at the level of the individual scientist, but rather
research outputs at the university level.
The study most closely related is Thursby and Thursby (2007) which examines the research profiles of 3,241 faculty from six major US universities from
1983 through 1999. They find that while the probability a faculty member will
disclose an invention increased tenfold over this period, the portion of research
that is published in “basic” journals remained constant. They also find that both
publications and disclosure activity rise and then fall with age (with publications
peaking before disclosure). These results suggest that understanding the relationship between faculty research and licensing requires an understanding, not only of
financial incentives, but also life cycle behavior.
There is little theoretical research on the financial incentives facing faculty and
the allocation of eﬀort across types of research. Beath et al. (2003) and Jensen
and Thursby (2004) both examine faculty research incentives in a principal agent
context where the university is the principal and the faculty member the agent.
Beath et al.’s (2003) analysis is static and examines the potential for the university
5

to ease its budget constraint by allowing faculty to conduct applied research on a
consulting basis. By contrast, Jensen and Thursby’s (2004) model is dynamic and
provides an analysis of the eﬀect of patent licensing on research and the quality
of education, where the latter eﬀect is a function of research choices (and hence
future stocks of knowledge) as well as the portion of patentable knowledge that
can be used in education. Given their emphasis on the education problem, they
abstract from life cycle patterns. Their work is similar to ours since the faculty
they model derive utility simply from the time spent doing the research as well as
the prestige associated with successful research. They show that with these eﬀects
in the researcher’s choice problem, the opportunity to earn license income may
well not change his/her research agenda, which of course provides one explanation
for why we might observe little change in the pattern of basic relative to applied
publications.

Basic Model

In this Section, we consider the research profile of an individual faculty member
over the life cycle. In our model, the faculty member can engage in applied and/or
basic research and can earn income both as current salary and license income.
Both types of research have consumption value and both contribute to current and
future income since research, as well as teaching, is rewarded in salary. Thus, as in
Levin and Stephan (1991), there is a consumption motive for research that does not
decline over the life cycle and a financial motive that does. In our case, however,
there is an additional financial motive for applied research, which does not decline
over the life cycle. Applied work that is licensed provides a future income stream
that continues regardless of work eﬀort.
In general, we think of a faculty member choosing across four activities at any
time t: teaching, ht , basic research, bt , applied research, at , and leisure, nt . We
assume the hours devoted to teaching are determined by a fixed teaching load, so
that we consider the eﬀective time constraint as 100 = bt + at + nt . The faculty
member’s objective is to maximize utility over her career, which begins at time 0
(receipt of PhD) and ends at retirement, T . Utility, Ut , is a function of research
output, Rt (this is the love of problem solving), market goods, Xt , leisure, nt ,
and the net present value of assets at retirement, V (AT ). The faculty member’s

6

problem is to choose bt , at , Xt , nt , and AT to maximize
Z T
e−ρt U (Rt , Xt , nt )dt + V (AT )
J =

(1)

0

where ρ > 0, U(·) and V (·) are assumed to be twice diﬀerentiable and strictly
concave in their arguments.
In it’s most general form, research output is a function of time spent on basic
and/or applied research, as well as the individual’s knowledge stock Kt .
Rt = f(bt , at , Kt ).

(2)

The knowledge base, Kt , increases with Rt , and, while knowledge doesn’t diminish with time, its relevance for current research does, so that changes in the
stock of relevant knowledge is given by
·

Kt = Rt − δKt

(3)

St = rKt + Ht

(4)

where δ is the depreciation rate.
Salary is, in part, remuneration for teaching (assumed equal for all individuals
and all t). Faculty members are also compensated for research (all of which we
assume is publishable). Here we assume that salary is not determined simply
by current research, but also the output from past research that is still useful in
research. Her current salary is then given by

where Ht represents income from teaching and r is the rental rate on the stock
of knowledge (that is, relevant publications). Under Bayh-Dole, research can also
lead to license income.
The faculty member can also earn license income, which is a function of licenses
generated by her work and her share of the university’s income from these licenses.
While, in general, licenses can be based on either basic or applied research, recent
survey evidence suggests that most embryonic inventions require further development for commercial success (Thursby et al. 2002, and Jensen and Thursby 2001).
For the moment, we abstract from development eﬀort (which would not be publishable) and assume that, in general, licensable output, Lt , is a function of time
spent on applied and basic research, as well as the stock of knowledge.
Lt = g(at , bt , Kt ).
7

(5)

The change in financial assets over time is given by
·

At = −pXt + St + sVt (Lt ) + iAt

(6)

where p is the (constant) price of market goods and i is the interest rate, and Vt (Lt )
is the net present value of licensable output at time t. There is no uncertainty in
the model so the net present value of licensable output, Vt , is known and s is the
inventor’s share of license revenue. We assume that capital markets are perfect so
that the faculty member’s license income can be cashed in at t.

Licensing versus No Licensing Simulations

The system is suﬃciently complex that we resort to simulations to characterize the
time paths of research eﬀorts and productivity. To simplify, we follow Ryder et al.
(1976) in assuming ρ = i = 0 so that life cycle earnings are spread evenly over the
life cycle. We set current consumption Xt = 100 and the initial value of K0 = 1.
The utility function is one commonly used in life cycle models:
U = ln(Rtθ1 Xtθ2 nθt 3 )

(7)

where θi > 0 (i = 1, 2, 3)
For the research production function, we pick a form that allows us to incorporate the notion that applied work may indeed improve the productivity of basic
research eﬀort:
γ

γ

γ

γ

Rt = ϕ [at γ 1 bt γ 2 Kt 3 ] + (1 − ϕ) [(at 1 + bt 2 )Kt 3 ] .

(8)

where γ i ≥ 0 (i = 1, 2, 3) and ϕ is either 0 and 1. When ϕ = 1, the production
function is purely multiplicative and allows for the complementarity of applied
and basic work observed by Mansfield (1995) and Zucker et.al (1994, 1998). When
ϕ = 0 it is additive so that applied and basic research are substitutes(as implied by
Cohen et al. (1994)). The additive form allows the faculty member to specialize
in either type of research, but precludes complementarity.
In the most general case, we also allow basic and applied eﬀort to directly lead
to licenses as well as publications:
Lt = at α1 (1 + bt )α2 Ktα3 .

(9)

where αi ≥ 0 (i = 1, 2, 3). This form loosely captures the notion that inventions
licensed require further development since some applied eﬀort is always necessary in
8

order to produce licenses. While basic eﬀort in period t is not necessary for period
t license output, for α2 > 0 it will have a direct eﬀect on license output in addition
to the indirect eﬀect through the stock of knowledge. By allowing complementarity
of basic and applied eﬀort in both research and licensing, we allow for the much
discussed case of research in Pasteur’s Quadrant where curiosity driven research
has immediate commercial applications.
We solve the system for Rt , At , Lt , Kt , at , bt , and nt (where nt = 100 − at − bt )
for given values of the utility and production function parameters ϕ, θi (i = 1, 2, 3),
γ i (i = 1, 2, 3), αi (i = 1, 2, 3), the rate of depreciation of the knowledge base, δ,
and the share of licensing income that accrues to the researcher, s. All parameters
are non-negative. Without loss of generality we set T = 30. For each combination
of parameters we solve the system and record the values of the variables Rt , Lt ,
Kt , at , bt , and nt at periods t = 1, 2, ..., 30. Thus, while the system is continuous,
we only examine it at 30 points over the life-cycle beginning with the first period
(one period after the start of employment as a faculty member) and ending with
the final period (the beginning of retirement).
To answer the basic question of how licensing aﬀects faculty choices and resulting outputs, we compare life cycle behavior when licensing is not rewarded
(s = 0) with the pattern when s > 0. We do this for a large set of parameter values and for diﬀerent variations of the production functions. Results are
presented for parameter combinations from the sets δ = (0.2, 0.4), γ 3 = (0.2, 0.3),
γ 1 = (0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5), and γ 2 = (0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.75) where γ 1 < γ 2 . Early runs
indicated that qualitative results on life-cycle behavior varied little over the parameters of the utility function thus we use only single values for the θi (θ1 = θ2 = 0.25
and θ3 = 0.5).3 In the non-licensing regime all αi = 0 and s = 0. In the licensing regime we use parameter combinations from the sets s = (0.25, 0.5, 0.7),
α1 = (0.4, 0.6, 0.8), α2 = (0.0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) where α1 > α2 and α3 = (0.25, 0.4, 0.6).
While the system does not converge for all parameter combinations, it does for
a large number. Since behavior clearly depends on parameter values, we present
results based on averages across parameter combinations.
In Sections 3.1−3.2, we present results for three production functions of interest.
As a benchmark, Section 3.1 considers results for a model that, without licensing,
is similar to Levin and Stephan’s life cycle model. In this model, there is a single
type of research that is publishable (i.e, ϕ = 1, and γ 1 = 0) and when licensing is
3

Note that increases in the parameters of the research production function increase research
output and aﬀect utility. Hence, an increase in θ3 is tantamount to increasing the production
parameters.

9

possible, license output only requires applied eﬀort (which is not publishable) but
yields license income (i.e., α2 = 0 and s > 0). Section 3.2 presents results for the
case where applied and basic research are complements in both the research and
licensing production functions (φ = 1 and all αi and γ i are positive). Section 3.3
presents the case where applied and basic eﬀort are substitutes in the production
of research.

3.1

Development Model

In this section, we consider the behavior of a faculty member who maximizes life
cycle utility given by (7) when research and licensing production are given by
γ

Rt = bt γ 2 Kt 3

(10)

Lt = at α1 Ktα3 .

(11)

and

Intuitively, we would expect this model to provide the bleakest view of the eﬀect
of licensing since the applied eﬀort necessary for licensing does not contribute to
the knowledge base. For this reason we refer to this as the “development model.”
To the extent that the financial return to licensing diverts faculty from basic to
applied work, the stream of research suﬀers. It is not clear how much work eﬀort
will be diverted, however, because applied work provides only license income while
basic eﬀort provides utility and income.
Figure 1 plots the average values of applied and basic eﬀort across parameter
combinations when licensing is not rewarded (s = 0) and when it is (s > 0). In this
case, there are no returns to licensing (pecuniary or nonpecuniary) when s = 0, so
at is zero in every period. Results of note are:
1. When licensing is rewarded, some eﬀort is diverted to applied work in every
period and this eﬀort increases throughout the life cycle. This, of course, follows
from the fact that returns to research output end at period T while licensing output
gives returns beyond T .
2. With licensing, basic eﬀort exceeds applied eﬀort early and late in the life
cycle, though the eﬀect is quite small on average. In the middle of the career,
however, basic eﬀort with licensing falls below that without licensing. By the
end of the career, basic eﬀort (and hence research output) falls toward zero in
the absence of licensing, while with licensing, basic eﬀort decreases but remains
positive throughout the life cycle. This occurs because of the indirect eﬀect of
10

basic eﬀort on license output through the stock of knowledge. Thus the financial
return to license output increases basic as well as applied eﬀort toward the end of
the life cycle (relative to a regime without licensing).
3. Leisure can be inferred from the combined plots for at and bt , and is given in
Figure 2. In both the licensing and non-licensing regimes, leisure activity increases
over the life-cycle. Since the ability to license increases applied eﬀort and reduces
basic eﬀort over some periods, whether licensing increases or decreases leisure depends on the relative eﬀects. For the parameter values we consider, the net eﬀect
of the second source of income on leisure is always negative; faculty always work
more in a licensing regime though the split of eﬀort between basic and applied is
aﬀected.
4. As in Levin and Stephan (1991), research output and the stock of knowledge
initially increase but eventually decrease as a result of the decrease in basic eﬀort
over time. As shown in Figure 3, research output is generally lower with than
without licensing. Only at the very beginning and very end of a career does the
presence of licensing increase research output R. This, of course, follows from the
fact that basic eﬀort (which is the only eﬀort that adds to the stock of knowledge
in this case) early and late in a career is higher with than without licensing. It is
important to note, however, that comparisons of the levels of research output and
the stock of knowledge (as opposed to the shape of the plots) are dependent on
the parameter values considered and we present only averages over a number of
parameter combinations.4
5. In Figure 4 we plot the level of licensing output when s > 0 (licensing output
is, of course, always zero when s = 0). Interestingly, L rises throughout a career
until the very last periods. Recall that basic eﬀort in this model does not directly
enter the licensing production function, though it does enter through its eﬀect on
the stock of knowledge K. Thus, the fall in L at the end of the career comes from
the fall in basic research and the resulting eﬀect on K. In Thursby and Thursby
(2007) we consider the disclosure activity of a sample of 3342 faculty over as many
as 17 years. For those faculty we find that disclosure activity (and hence, most
likely licensing) rises early in a career only to fall in the final stages of the life cycle.
Thus our empirical results support the theoretical results presented here.
To summarize, in this model licensing does indeed divert faculty from research
4

Since we are presenting average behavior for a highly nonlinear process it can be misleading
to consider, say, average behavior for basic and applied eﬀort and use that to infer, say, research
output. It is not the case that average research behavior across a number of parameter combinations is the same as research computed from average basic and applied eﬀort for those same
parameter combinations.

11

over most of the career and the stock of knowledge K is generally lower with
licensing. This detrimental eﬀect follows from our narrow definition of research in
which only basic eﬀort adds to research output and the stock of knowledge. Note,
however, that licensing leads faculty to work more over the career. Also, while
research output and the stock of knowledge rise and then fall with licensing, the
plots are flatter than without licensing. Toward the end of the career, research
output with licensing is higher than without. Because this eﬀect is late, however,
the stock of knowledge suﬀers in the licensing regime (as compared to no licensing).

3.2

Complements Model

We now consider the case that one would expect to provide the most favorable
view of licensing. In this case, the applied eﬀort that is necessary for licensing also
produces publishable research output so that it adds to the stock of knowledge,
and it enters the faculty member’s utility function. Basic and applied eﬀort are
complements in both the research and license production functions in the sense
that an increase in either type of eﬀort increases the marginal product of the
other. The production functions are given by:
γ

Rt = at γ 1 bt γ 2 Kt 3 ,

(12)

Lt = at α1 (1 + bt )α2 Ktα3 .

(13)

and

In the research function, we restrict the analysis to cases where, for the same
amount of eﬀort, basic has a higher marginal product than applied eﬀort, or γ 1 >
γ 2 . In the licensing function we assume the opposite in that the exponent of applied
is larger than that of basic eﬀort (α1 > α2 ). Figures 5 through 8 give life-cycle
results in both the case of no licensing (s = 0) and licensing (s > 0).
1) Applied and basic eﬀort are plotted in Figure 5. Without licensing, basic
eﬀort is always greater than applied and both converge to values close to zero
by the end of the career. This results from the assumption that γ 1 < γ 2 . With
licensing, however, basic eﬀort exceeds applied only in the early part of the career.
It is important to note that even though the ratio of applied to basic eﬀort increases
(and exceeds one early on), basic eﬀort throughout the career exceeds basic eﬀort
in the absence of licensing. This most likely occurs because basic and applied eﬀort
are complements in licensing as well as research. Also, and unlike the no licensing
regime, applied and basic eﬀort late in the life cycle converge to positive levels
12

rather than zero at the end of the life-cycle. This is a result of the extra financial
incentive associated with licensing.
2) As in the development case, leisure increases throughout the life cycle. Figure
6 shows that this pattern occurs regardless of the licensing regime, but the increase
in leisure is much more dramatic in the no licensing regime. There is much less
leisure in the presence of licensing, and the increase in leisure late in the career is
modest.
3) In Figure 7 we plot the stock of knowledge and research output in the licensing and no licensing regimes. Because overall research eﬀort is higher with
licensing, there is necessarily greater research output and a higher stock of knowledge throughout the life cycle, though the diﬀerences are small until late in the
career. Further, the life-cycle graphs are flatter under licensing; the fall in research
and stock of knowledge is substantially sharper in the no licensing regime.
6) In Figure 8 we present licensing output when s > 0. Unlike the development
case, there is no modest reduction in licensing output late in the career.
To summarize, the complements case presents a more favorable view of licensing than the development case. While the nature of research changes toward more
applied eﬀort, this eﬀort is useful in both research and licensing and adds to the
stock of knowledge. In the development case, research and the stock of knowledge
suﬀered from licensing since applied eﬀort did not contribute to the stock of knowledge. Also, there is less of a reduction in licensing output late in the career for the
complements model than for the development model. Finally, to the extent that
there is diversion away from basic eﬀort, it is only a relative eﬀect. In levels there
is more of both basic and applied eﬀort. To the extent that there is a meaningful
diversion of faculty eﬀort, it is a diversion away from leisure.
While not shown in the figures, an increase in the rate of depreciation δ of
the knowledge base decreases the amount of basic and applied research in each
period, and, as well, it decreases research output and the stock of knowledge. This
result is consistent with earlier work on the obsolescence of knowledge and life cycle
behavior and is independent of the licensing regime.5

3.3

Substitutes Model

A natural question to ask is how dependent these results are on the form of the
production function. In particular, the suggestion from the empirical literature is
that if basic and applied eﬀort are substitutes rather than complements, licensing
5

See McDowell (1982) and Stephan and Levin (1992).

13

might negatively aﬀect the profile of research output and the stock of knowledge
(Cohen et al. 1998). To examine this, we consider life cycle behavior when the
production function is given by
γ

γ

γ

Rt = [(at 1 + bt 2 )Kt 3 ] .

(14)

So that the only change in the model is in the research production function, we
continue to assume the licensing production function is given by (13). Thus, while
applied work does not improve the productivity of basic eﬀort, basic eﬀort can still
be thought of as lying in the so-called Pastuer’s Quadrant. We continue to restrict
the analysis to cases where γ 1 > γ 2 and α1 > α2 .
Results are in Figures 9 to 12. There are only two meaningful diﬀerences
in life-cycle behavior between the substitutes and complements models. First,
basic eﬀort is always higher than applied in the substitutes model regardless of
the licensing regime.6 Thus applied and basic eﬀort need not be complements in
the production of research in order for basic research to benefit from licensing.
Second, there is a clear downturn in licensing output at the end of the career. Of
greater importance are the similarities between the two models. Note that life-cycle
behavior is essentially the same for the complements and substitutes models and
that neither total research output nor the stock of knowledge suﬀer with licensing.

Tenure

So far we have abstracted from the incentives created by a system in which faculty
obtain tenure seven years into the career cycle. In this section, we explore how
a tenure system might aﬀect research eﬀort with licensing. The tenure system
we envision is one in which the faculty member knows that basic research will
be counted toward tenure, while applied work may not be counted toward it, and
leisure surely is not. In the periods before the university makes the tenure decision,
we assume that spending time on applied research and leisure increases the risk of
not getting tenure, while engaging in basic research decreases the risk.
We model risk as the disutility associated with applied research and leisure
before tenure. We use a simple time-varying coeﬃcient of risk-aversion, η t , of the
faculty member which can assume two values over her career: a positive value before the tenure decision at time d, t 6 d, and zero on tenure, i.e, t > d. Utility,
Ut , is a function of research output, Rt , consumption of market goods, Xt , leisure,
6

This would occur in the complements model only with suﬃciently low values of s.

14

nt , (dis)utility from risk-aversion, Φt , and the net present value of assets at retirement, V (AT ). The faculty member’s problem is to choose bt , at , Xt , nt , and AT to
maximize the utility function given by:
Z T
e−ρt U (Rt , Xt , nt , Φt )dt + V (AT ).
(15)
J=
0

where the disutility associated with risk is modeled as

(1 + at )(1 + nt )
.
(16)
bt
Thus, the disutilty from risk-aversion is an increasing function of the researcher’s
coeﬃcient of risk-aversion, η t , applied research, at , leisure, nt , and a decreasing
function of basic research, bt . A more risk-averse faculty member has a higher
positive value of the coeﬃcient of risk-aversion, and as a consequence, has a higher
disutility from engaging in applied research and leisure before tenure. The coeﬃcient of risk-aversion can vary across faculty members and varies over the life-cycle,
depending on whether a faculty member is tenured or not.
Thus, in our simplified model, we consider the eﬀect of risk associated with
the nature of research before tenure and not the risk associated with low research
output since we continue to assume that all research output is publishable. Alternatively, we could attach a higher probability of publication to diﬀerent types
of research eﬀort, or we could introduce a threshold of publications necessary to
obtain tenure.7 The second alternative would necessitate a more complicated production structure and should yield similar results since it would increase expected
utility from basic research eﬀort. The last alternative might well produce diﬀerent results since the tenure decision would not distinguish between the types of
research eﬀort in awarding tenure.
To operationalize tenure in our simulations, we consider a simple time-varying
coeﬃcient of risk-aversion of the faculty member, assuming values of η t ∈(0.25, 0.50)
before tenure decision (t 6 d), and ηt = 0 for all periods after tenure (t > d), where
the tenure decision is made at period d = 7.
Φt = −η t

4.1

Tenure in the Development Model

Consider again the model in which applied eﬀort produces only license output
and basic eﬀort only aﬀects licensing though the stock of knowledge. In Figures
7

See Siow (1984) for a model of occupational choice under uncertainty.

15

13 through 16 we assume a tenure system is in eﬀect and then examine how the
introduction of a licensing regime aﬀects life-cycle behavior.8 Not surprisingly,
there is a sharp change in behavior pre-tenure versus post-tenure. With or without
licensing, basic eﬀort is much higher before than after tenure, while leisure is much
lower before tenure than after. In the licensing regime, applied research is relatively
lower before tenure than after.
In a tenure world, the introduction of licensing has a positive eﬀect on the
level of basic eﬀort (see Figure 13) throughout the life cycle, although this eﬀect is
more dramatic before the tenure year than after. This relatively large increase in
basic eﬀort early in the career leads to higher research output and a higher stock
of knowledge with licensing than without (See Figure 15). This, of course, is in
contrast to our results in the absence of tenure where the introduction of licensing
reduced basic eﬀort, research output, and the stock of knowledge over much of
the life cycle. The diﬀerence comes from the substantial boost that tenure gives
to basic eﬀort early on. This in turn, leads to a higher stock of knowledge which
carries forward through the remainder of the career.
The results for applied eﬀort and leisure with tenure are similar to those in
the absence of tenure, with the exception that the increase in applied eﬀort that
results from licensing is relatively larger after the tenure year. Finally, in Figure
16 we again see a fall in licensing output late in the career. Also, the fact that
licensing induces applied eﬀort, in combination with the inducement for basic eﬀort
in a tenure system leads to a jump in licensing output at the time of tenure. In
Thursby and Thursby (2007) we found not only a fall in disclosure activity late in
the career but also a rise early in the career. This pattern observed in the data is
consistent with the life-cycle pattern observed here.
In summary, tenure leads to an abrupt change in life-cycle behavior at the time
of tenure, but post-tenure life-cycle behavior is similar in form to what we observed
in the absence of tenure with one very important diﬀerence. Licensing in a nontenure world for the development model had a negative eﬀect on research; in a
tenure regime, the eﬀect of licensing is positive.

4.2

Tenure in the Complements Model

Figures 17 through 21 present the plots for the complements model with a tenure
system. As with the development model, we observe a sharp change in behavior
8

The “odd” behavior of the system in periods 8 and 9 are most likely due to diﬃculties in the
optimization program with the discontinuity in η after period 7.

16

pre-tenure versus post tenure. However, as is evident in Figure 17, the boost that
a tenure system gives to basic eﬀort (and hence the stock of knowledge) early in
the career is greatest in the absence of licensing. Post tenure, both applied and
basic eﬀort are higher in a licensing regime, but the early eﬀect on the stock of
knowledge leads to higher research in a non-licensing regime.
Interpreting these results is diﬃcult because of the oﬀsetting eﬀects involved.
There is an increased incentive for basic eﬀort in the first six years with a tenure
system. Because of the complementarity of basic and applied eﬀort in both production and licensing, the introduction of licensing increases the incentive for both
types of eﬀort (hence the reduction in leisure), but the impact depends on the
exponents in the production functions, as well as the share of revenue accruing to
the faculty member.
To better understand these eﬀects, we separated our results into those with
low and high incentives to license. Figure 21 plots applied eﬀort for three cases:
no licensing, licensing with s < 0.5, α1 ≤ 0.4, and α2 < 0.5, and licensing with
s ≥ 0.5, α1 ≥ 0.6, and α2 ≥ 0.5. As expected, applied eﬀort is highest in the
regime with higher shares and productivity of eﬀort in licensing. However, as
shown in Figure 22, the impact of licensing on basic eﬀort is nonlinear. Prior to
the tenure year, basic eﬀort is highest without licensing and lowest with high license
incentives. In the middle of her career (i.e., after tenure until late in the career),
basic eﬀort is highest for positive but relatively low shares and license productivity
and lowest without licensing. Late in the career, basic eﬀort is highest for the high
license incentives.
Figure 23 plots research output for the three cases. Until very late in the career,
research output is highest in the licensing regime with low values of s and αi , and
it is lowest in the licensing regime with high values of s and αi .This means that
licensing improves research output when the returns are positive but relatively low,
but it compromises research output over much of the life cycle when the returns
are very high. The reason for this is that tenure boosts basic eﬀort prior to the
tenure year much more when s, and αi are low or equal to zero than when s and
αi are high. The relative high levels of basic eﬀort early in the career with low or
zero s and αi yield relatively higher stocks of knowledge, so that basic and applied
eﬀorts are more productive in those cases after tenure.
Thus licensing in a tenure world increases basic eﬀort for much of the career as
long as the financial incentives are not too high. This result is interesting in light
of Jensen et al.’s (2003) finding that faculty shares of royalty income are indeed
lower in US universities with higher quality faculty (as measured by the National
Research Council rankings of PhD granting departments). In their work, admin17

istrators set the shares of license income accruing to faculty and the technology
transfer oﬃce (TTO) in a principal agent model with the administrator as the principal and the TTO and faculty as agents. Utility in their model is a function only
of revenue, so diversion of faculty from research is not an issue to administrators.
Our results suggest a new implication of their empirical result; that is, perhaps
administrators in top universities (as defined by the NRC) have been wise in their
choices.

Concluding Remarks

An important issue in the debates over university licensing is whether the associated
financial incentives compromise the research mission of the university by diverting
faculty from basic research. In this paper, we argue that understanding the eﬀects
of licensing on research requires an understanding of faculty motives in conducting
research and how they vary over the life cycle. We construct several life cycle
models of faculty behavior that take into account both the puzzle solving and
financial motives for faculty to conduct research. In the models we consider, the
faculty member faces a fixed teaching load and chooses the amount of time to
devote to research (which can be either basic or applied) and the amount of time
to take as leisure. We consider her behavior with and without the possibility of
licensing. This allows us to examine the eﬀect of licensing on the research mix, as
well as the total amount of time working, throughout the life cycle.
We show that, with or without licensing, and regardless of the research production functions considered, faculty devote more time to research early in their
career, so that leisure rises over time. In that sense, licensing does not alter life cycle patterns. There are, nonetheless, real eﬀects of licensing since it yields a higher
ratio of applied to basic eﬀort and lower leisure throughout the life cycle. Thus, as
suggested by Lach and Schankerman (2003), faculty respond to economic incentives This is not to say, however, that licensing compromises research eﬀort. In
our models, leisure is the activity most compromised, so that total research eﬀort
rises; and in most of the models we consider, basic eﬀort rises with the introduction
of licensing.
The implications of licensing for research output and the stock of knowledge
depend on the model specification. The worst case scenario is of course the development model without tenure because in this case applied eﬀort adds nothing to
the stock of knowledge. In this case, research output suﬀers from the introduction
of licensing. If, however, the applied eﬀort involved in licensing leads to publish18

able output as well as licenses, then the outlook is more favorable. In these cases,
research output and the stock of knowledge are generally higher with licensing than
without. Interestingly, this result is not dependent on the assumption that basic
and applied eﬀort are complements in production. It stems, rather, from the fact
that applied eﬀort contributes to the stock of knowledge and the complementarity
of basic and applied eﬀort and the stock of knowledge in the license production
function. Finally, the only negative eﬀect of licensing in these cases is with a tenure
system when the incentives to license are extremely high.
Several limitations of the analysis should be noted. First, our production functions represent output in terms of numbers of publications and licenses. Another
limitation is that the analysis relies on simulations with particular functional forms
and parameter values. Further, it is important to note that the results presented
are based on averages across parameter values.
