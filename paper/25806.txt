Survival of the Fittest: The Impact of the Minimum Wage on Firm Exit

ABSTRACT
We study the impact of the minimum wage on firm exit in the restaurant industry, exploiting
recent changes in the minimum wage at the city level. We find that the impact of the minimum
wage depends on whether a restaurant was already close to the margin of exit. Restaurants with
lower ratings are closer to the margin of exit on average, and are disproportionately driven out of
business by increases to the minimum wage. Our point estimates suggest that a one dollar
increase in the minimum wage leads to a 10 percent increase in the likelihood of exit for a 3.5star restaurant (which is the median rating on Yelp), but has no discernible impact for a 5-star
restaurant (on a 1 to 5 star scale). We expand the analysis to look at prices using data from
delivery orders, and find that lower rated restaurants also increase prices in response to minimum
wage increases. Our analysis also highlights how digital data can be used to shed new light on
labor policy and the economy.

I. Introduction
The minimum wage has recently re-entered the forefront of policy discourse as federal
proposals range from leaving it as is at $7.25, increasing it to $10.10 or raising it to as high as
$15 per hour.1 While the federal minimum wage has remained stagnant since 2009, states – and
more recently, cities – have increasingly set local minimum wages above the federal mandate.
Theory dating back to Stigler (1946) has highlighted the potential for the minimum wage
to distort markets. At the firm level, increasing the minimum wage creates a shock to the costs
incurred by a business. One important way in which businesses can adjust is by exiting the
market altogether. The basic argument is that firms will choose to stay in the market as long as it
is profitable. Increases to the minimum wage reduce firm value and the profitability of operating
(Bell and Machin, 2018; Draca, Machin, and Van Reenen, 2011), and hence have the potential to
cause businesses that were already close to the margin to exit the market. Seminal theory from
Williamson (1968) suggests that higher minimum wages can help larger or more productive
firms, and lead to fewer small or less productive firms.
In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of the minimum wage on firm
closures in the restaurant industry. As theory would suggest, we find robust evidence that the
impact of the minimum wage depends on how close a restaurant is to the margin of exit, proxied
by its rating. Looking at city-level minimum wage changes in the San Francisco Bay Area (the
“Bay Area”), we present two main findings. First, at all observed minimum wage levels,

While his exact stance on the minimum wage is not clear, President Trump has intimated that he would prefer to
eliminate the federal minimum wage and let states determine their own minimum wages
(http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-presidential-debate-fact-check/2016/10/trump-kaine-minimum-wage-229149).
Bernie Sanders proposed a $15 federal minimum wage as part of his presidential campaign in 2016
(https://berniesanders.com/issues/a-living-wage/).

restaurants with lower ratings are more likely to exit, suggesting that they are less efficient in the
economic sense. Moreover, lower rated restaurants are disproportionately affected by minimum
wage increases. In other words, the impact of the minimum wage on exit is most pronounced
among restaurants that are closer to the margin of exit.
The restaurant industry in the Bay Area makes a compelling setting to investigate the
impact of the minimum wage on small businesses. First, the restaurant industry is the most
intensive employer of minimum wage workers (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016b). Second,
there is high turnover within the restaurant industry. In our sample – which covers restaurants in
the Bay Area from 2008 through 2016 – roughly 5 percent of restaurants go out of business each
year. The exit margin is hence economically meaningful. Additionally, there is no tip credit in
California, meaning that tips do not count toward the official wage and wait staff are covered by
the same minimum wage as other employees, so the minimum wage is more likely to be binding.
Finally, there have been many recent minimum wage increases in the area, with a number of
cities implementing minimum wages upwards of $12.
Our analysis proceeds in two stages. First, we provide evidence that lower rated
businesses are, on average, closer to the margin of exit and fail at higher rates than higher rated
restaurants, irrespective of the minimum wage level. Empirically, there is significant and
predictable variation in how close to the margin of exit firms are. A one-star increase in rating is
associated with more than a 50% decrease in the likelihood of going out of business. We then
exploit the multiple city-level minimum wage changes in recent years across the Bay Area to
implement a difference-in-differences design to investigate the effects of the minimum wage. We
do not find robust evidence that higher minimum wages lead to overall increases in restaurant
exit rates. While the estimates are uniformly positive, they are imprecisely estimated. However,
3

this masks important heterogeneity – we find a clear and significant relationship between the
impact of the minimum wage on restaurant exit and the rating of the restaurant.
We find that the impact of the minimum wage on the likelihood of exit decreases as the
restaurant’s rating increases. Our results suggest that a $1 increase in the minimum wage leads to
a 10 percent increase in the likelihood of exit for the median 3.5-star restaurant, but no impact
for five-star restaurants (the point estimate is in fact negative, suggesting that the likelihood of
exit might even decrease for five-star restaurants, but the estimate is not statistically different
from zero). These effects are robust to a number of different specifications, including controlling
for time-varying county characteristics that may influence both minimum wage policies and
restaurant demand, city-specific time trends to account for preexisting trends, as well as countyyear fixed effects to control for spatial heterogeneity in exit trends.
Businesses might also adjust to minimum wage increases by raising their prices
(Aaronson, 2001; Aaronson, French, and MacDonald, 2008; Allegretto and Reich, 2016). In our
context, it is a priori unclear whether we should expect higher or lower rated restaurants to pass
higher wages on to customers through price increases. If survival is driven by the ability to pass
on higher labor costs to consumers through higher prices among stronger businesses, then we
would expect to see higher rated restaurants raise prices more. On the other hand, if exit is driven
by the fact that lower rated businesses generally have lower profit margins and are more affected
by the minimum wage, then we might see lower rated restaurants increase prices by a greater
degree.
To explore, we use data on orders placed through the online delivery platform Eat24,
which has a partnership with Yelp. We find that the average cost of an order among higher rated
restaurants rose less in response to higher minimum wages relative to lower rated restaurants,
4

suggesting that minimum wage increases may have been more binding for lower rated
restaurants, and that they raise their prices as a way to offset higher labor costs.
Overall, our findings shed light on the economic impact of the minimum wage. Basic
theory predicts that the minimum wage will cause firms that cannot adjust in other ways to cover
their increased costs to exit the market. We find that lower rated firms (which are already closer
to the margin of exit) are disproportionately impacted by the minimum wage. After a minimum
wage increase, they are more likely to exit the market altogether and more likely to raise their
prices. Our work also relates to a large literature on labor effects of the minimum wage. While
some studies find no detrimental effects on employment (Card and Krueger, 1994, 2000; Dube,
Lester and Reich, 2010; Katz and Krueger, 1992), others show that higher minimum wage
reduces employment, especially among low-skilled workers (see Neumark and Wascher, 2007
for a review). Horton (2017) highlights that firms can also adjust employment at the intensive
margin.
In addition, our analysis also highlights how data from online platforms can be used to
better understand labor policy and the economy. Historically, datasets from the US Census
Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have formed the backbone of analyses looking
to estimate the impact of the minimum wage in the US (e.g. Dube, Lester and Reich, 2010,
Aaronson et al., forthcoming). Other analyses consist mainly of researcher-administered surveys
(e.g. Katz and Krueger, 1992; Card and Krueger, 1994). While administrative datasets are critical
to our understanding of the minimum wage and the economy more generally, the effects we
identify in this paper would have been difficult to observe using standard datasets.
The growth of online review platforms such as Yelp allow for unique insights into this
issue. First, we can use each restaurant’s rating as a proxy for its reputation, a measure that is not
5

captured by conventional datasets. This lets us to evaluate whether the minimum wage
differentially impacts businesses of lower reputation. Second, we are able to use exit data in
close to real time, whereas BLS and Census data only become publicly available after a lag. This
allows researchers and policymakers to more quickly understand the impacts of different
economic policies. Third, we are able to observe granular data on businesses, whereas the public
versions of the Census and BLS data are aggregated to coarser geographic levels, such as by
county (depending on the variable the researcher is interested in). In principle, researchers can
access restricted business-level data via an extensive application process, but the current waiting
period for access even among approved applications is estimated to be two years. For example, a
researcher trying to understand the impact of a policy change in 2017 would not be able to
examine firm-level microdata from the Census until at least 2020. By using data from online
platforms, researchers can measure the impacts in close to real time. While there are important
limitations to data from online platforms as well, our analysis suggests that they are a valuable
complement to more traditional data sources.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. We discuss the landscape of minimum wages
across the United States in recent years in Section II. Section III discusses the data and empirical
strategy, and presents some graphical evidence. Section IV reports the main results. Section V
examines the impact on prices, aggregate entry, exit, and survival. Section VI presents several
robustness checks, and Section VII concludes.
II. The minimum wage in recent years
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 is binding for roughly 2.6 million hourly
workers (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016a), with the restaurant industry having the highest
percent of employees at the minimum (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016b). In addition to the
6

$7.25 federal minimum wage rate, 29 states and 41 cities have introduced higher than federal
minimum wage. For example, San Francisco is set to increase its minimum wage to $15 in July
2018 from its current wage of $ 13 (since July 1, 2016).
We focus our analysis on the Bay Area, a region comprising of 101 cities surrounding the
San Francisco Bay (“Bay Area”). The Bay Area is home to more than 7.5 million people, and
includes the major cities and metropolitan areas of San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland.
Among the 41 cities and counties that have changed their minimum wage ordinances at the local
level since 2012, 15 were in the Bay Area.2 We document 21 total local changes during our
sample period from 2008 through 2016, with four additional cities set to increase their minimum
beginning in 2017. Beyond the wide variation in minimum wage, focusing on a single region
potentially allows us to better control for macroeconomic trends and attitudes towards labor
standards.
Figure 1 depicts the changes for the state of California and 11 cities in the Bay Area that
have increased their minimum wage independently and above the state mandate since 2008.3 In
cities with separate minimum wages for large (usually defined as over 500 employees) and small
companies, we use the minimum wage for small companies, as the majority of full-service and
limited-service restaurants have fewer than 500 employees (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014). At the
state level, the minimum wage was set at $8 in the beginning of the sample, increased to $9 in
2014, and then to $10 in 2016. However, a subset of cities raised their minimum wages above the

Four additional cities (San Leandro, Cupertino, Los Altos, San Mateo) are slated to increase their minimum wage
above the state level in 2017.

state minimum wage, creating variation at different times and across cities within the Bay Area.
This leads to minimum wage changes of different magnitude and beginning at different dates for
different cities. For example, Berkeley had the same minimum wage as the state until 2014 when
they increased their minimum wage to $10 – $1 higher than the state mandate. They further
raised their minimum wage to $11 in 2015, while the state mandate remained at $9. California
increased the state-wide minimum wage to $10 in 2016, whereas Berkeley left their minimum
wage at $11 until later that year when they increased it to $12.53. Oakland did not increase their
minimum wage more than the state mandate until 2015, when they raised the minimum wage to
$12.25, more than three dollars above the state mandate (which stayed at $9) , and then increased
it again to $12.55 in 2016, when California increased the state minimum wage to $10. Our
difference-in-difference framework hence leverages the variation in both the timing and different
levels of minimum wages implemented by cities across the Bay Area.
III.

Data and empirical strategy

A. Restaurant data
Our underlying restaurant data are obtained from the online review platform Yelp. Yelp
was founded in 2004 in San Francisco and is now a dominant review platform in the US. On
Yelp, users can leave text reviews and ratings (from 1 to 5) for individual businesses, ranging
from dry cleaners to dentists.
We start with the universe of all Yelp reviews for the Bay Area since 2008, and limit the
dataset to only reviews for full-service and limited-service restaurants. Based on the review-level
data, we form an unbalanced panel dataset at the restaurant-month level, where a restaurant
enters the panel when it becomes active on Yelp (either by the owner registering the business, a

8

reviewer registering the business, or receiving the first review), and leaves the panel after it has
been marked as having been closed on Yelp.
The indicator for restaurant exit is crowdsourced. On each restaurant’s Yelp page, users
have the option of updating the restaurant’s business details, including tagging it as having
closed or moved. Any suggested changes are then verified by Yelp moderators before being
marked as such on the restaurant’s profile page. In practice, timing of exit through Yelp may also
be more accurate than official administrative data, which contains nontrivial reporting lags and
errors. We exclude filtered reviews, which are deemed by Yelp’s algorithm as more likely to be
fake or untrustworthy (Luca and Zervas, 2016). The dataset contains basic information about the
restaurant, including the type of cuisine (e.g., “New American”, “Chinese”), the price range of a
typical meal of the restaurant (denoted by dollar signs ranging from $ to $$$$, with four dollar
signs being the most expensive)4, the exact location, and also time-varying characteristics such
as the running average rating, the number of reviews, and exit status.5
Yelp coverage of restaurants is close to universal in the Bay Area. Comparing Yelp data
to administrative data obtained for the city of San Francisco,6 the number of restaurants active at
the end of 2016 is 6,087 and 5,558 based on the San Francisco administrative and Yelp data,
respectively. Exit statistics generated from the two datasets are similar and consistent with
previous research. For example, a common statistic that the restaurant industry focuses on is the

4

The price range category is a crowd sourced element that is time-invariant. Upon reviewing a restaurant, users are
able to designate dollar signs indicating the cost of an approximate cost per person for a meal including one drink,
tax and tip based on the following criteria: $= under $10, $$=$11–$30, $$$=$31–$60, $$$$= over $61.
5
We constructed these variables such that they capture the measure at the end of the month, for example, the
running average of the restaurant at the end of the month, or the displayed rating at the end of the month.
6
SF OpenData is the central clearinghouse for data published by the City and County of San Francisco, and includes
a database of registered businesses that pay taxes, including their date of entry and exit. We restricted to the NAICS
code of 722 (full-service restaurants and limited-service restaurants).

9

rate of closure within one year of entry. Based on the administrative data, 19.8 percent of
restaurants exit within one year of entry, whereas Yelp data indicates 20.9 percent. Other
research on the restaurant industry has demonstrated similar numbers ranging from 23 percent in
Dallas, Texas (Cline Group, 2003) to around 26 percent in Columbus, Ohio (Parsa, Self, Njite,
and King, 2005).
We present two descriptive statistics of the data. The first set of statistics provides a
snapshot of the restaurants’ last appearance in the panel, i.e., at the end of 2016 or at the time of
exit (Table 1 Panel A). There are 35,227 unique restaurants in our dataset, with a mean number
of 184 reviews per restaurant and an average rating of 3.56.7 Among the entire universe of
restaurants, around 30 percent have closed. Restaurants remain in the panel for an average of 77
months8 and have an average price sign of 1.6 “dollar signs”. The second set of statistics shows a
summary at the monthly panel level (Table 1 Panel B). A restaurant receives on average 2.5 new
reviews each month with an average rating of 3.5. The likelihood of exit in any month is 0.4
percent.
B. Delivery orders data
We use orders data from the online delivery platform Eat24 to investigate whether
restaurants respond to higher minimum wages by increasing prices. Table 2 presents the same set
of characteristics as Table 1. Eat24, an online delivery platform, was acquired by Yelp and
incorporated with the Yelp interface in 2013. We hence have data on delivery orders from March

7

While Yelp displays ratings rounded to the nearest 0.5 on their website, we use unrounded version in the main
analysis. Whether we use the rounded or unrounded version of ratings does not affect the conclusions of our
analysis.

Note that this statistic may not accurately represent average lifespan of a restaurant since when the restaurant
becomes active on Yelp may not necessarily be the same as when the restaurant began operations.

10

2013 onward. There are 4,046 restaurants on Eat24, which represents slightly over 10 percent of
the restaurants in our main sample. Restaurants on Eat24 on average have a rating of 3.53 and
are similarly priced at 1.6 dollar signs, and are around the same age. However, restaurants on
Eat24 are concentrated among larger cities.
Using data from Eat24 to measure prices has important advantages and challenges. One
major advantage is that it allows us to observe a proxy for prices in real time at the restaurant
level. This also allows us to implicitly weight prices by popularity of different menu items
(which would be difficult if we based the analysis only on menu data without orders). However,
while the restaurants that are delivering via Eat24 are generally similar in observable
characteristics to other restaurants, they represent a nonrandom sample of businesses and may
differ from other businesses, which may affect the magnitude of the results on prices.
C. Graphical evidence
We first present graphical evidence of the relationship between a restaurant’s operational
status and its rating. Figure 2a depicts a snapshot of the overall distribution of restaurant ratings
when last observed in the dataset. The modal rating is 3.5, and ratings are generally more
positive than negative; there are fewer than 5 percent of restaurants with ratings 2 and below,
whereas 40 percent of restaurants have an average rating of 4 or above. Figure 2b overlays the
distribution by whether the restaurant has closed. The mass of ratings for closed restaurants is
concentrated towards lower ratings relative to operating restaurants, suggesting that a
restaurant’s rating is correlated with closure.
We further explore this by plotting the simple means of the monthly likelihood of exit by
displayed rating (which is the average rating rounded to the nearest 0.5). Figure 3 depicts a clear

11

negative relationship between the likelihood of exit and rating, again implying that restaurants
with lower ratings are closer to the margin of exit.
Figure 4 examines the mean likelihood of exit by restaurant rating and minimum wage.
To account for the fact that larger or wealthier cities are more likely to increase the minimum
wage, and that exit rates could be systematically different (higher) in those cities as well, we
obtain the residuals from regressing the likelihood of exit on city dummies, and plot the mean
residuals against rating, for when the minimum wage in the city equals to the state mandate,
versus when the minimum wage in the city is at least 20 percent higher than the state mandate.
The figure synthesizes our empirical strategy and our main result: at any rating level, the average
likelihood of exit is higher when the minimum wage is higher. However, the increase in the
likelihood of exit is greater for lower rated restaurants, and there does not appear to be any
penalty for the highest rated restaurants. We confirm this finding using a regression framework
in Section IV.
D. Empirical strategy
The graphical evidence presented in Section 3.B suggests several things. First, restaurants
with lower ratings are more likely to exit. Second, higher minimum wages are correlated with
higher probabilities of exit for lower rated restaurants. We use a difference-in-difference
framework to empirically analyze the impact of the minimum wage on restaurant exit decisions,
in which exploit the temporal and spatial variation in minimum wage increases at the city level
across the Bay Area. The basic regression model, estimated as a linear probability model, is as
follow:

controls to capture variation in macroeconomic conditions and variation in restaurant demand,
are restaurant fixed effects, which we include in some specifications to control for unobservable
underlying restaurant characteristics that could affect both ratings and the likelihood of exit, such
as the owner’s management ability or style. Other restaurant characteristics that are constant over
time, including the price range, location, type of cuisine, are also controlled implicitly by
restaurant fixed effects. In specifications where we do not include restaurant fixed effects and
compare across restaurants, we control for city and price range fixed effects. Ζ′ includes a host
of county-level time-varying characteristics that may influence both restaurant demand and
minimum wage policies, including the percent of young workers between ages 15 to 24, percent
black, percent under the poverty line, the unemployment rate, and logged per capita income.

As Figure 1 shows, cities that raised their minimum wages above the state mandate tend
to be larger and more populous cities. We address these differences in several ways. First, we
control for time-varying city and county level characteristics in Ζ′ to capture potential
differences between cities that may both affect minimum wage legislation and business
conditions. Second, the key identifying assumption of the difference-in-difference framework is
that exit trends in treatment cities would have exhibited parallel trends to comparison cities

absent of minimum wage hikes. While we cannot test for this directly, Figure 2 demonstrates
similar trends in exit rates between cities that raised their minimum wage (excluding San
Francisco since they raised their minimum wage earlier) and those that did not before 2014,
which was when most cities began raising their minimum wage. The trends are generally similar
across the two sets of restaurants. In both sets, observed exit increases over time – potentially
because of improved measurement of exit on Yelp over time. Although pre-existing trends
appear to be similar, we include city-specific time trends as a robustness check in certain
specifications. We also include county-year fixed effects in certain specifications to control for
spatial heterogeneity in exit trends that are unrelated to minimum wage policies. The estimated
impact of a $1 increase in the minimum wage is then given by . Standard errors are clustered by
city to allow for serial correlation within locale.
We then estimate the heterogeneous effects of the minimum wage by including an
interaction term of the minimum wage with the restaurant’s rating. More specifically, our
estimating equation becomes:

would provide an estimate of how the minimum wage affects exit by the

restaurant’s quality, as measured by its rating.
IV. Main results
A. Restaurant rating and exit
As in our graphical evidence, we first examine the relationship between a restaurant’s
likelihood of exit and its Yelp rating (Table 3). Cross-sectionally, a one-star increase in rating is
associated with a 0.09-0.1 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of exit in any given month
(Columns 1 and 2), which is consistent with Figure 3. After controlling for restaurant and time
14

fixed effects, the coefficient increases to approximately -0.29 percentage point (Column 3). The
relationship remains stable when we include city-specific time trends and county-year fixed
effects (Columns 4 and 5). Our results imply a one-star increase in rating is associated with a
decline in the likelihood of exit of around 70 percent.
The negative relationship observed between restaurant rating and exit is not necessarily
causal – it is certainly possible that poor quality restaurants are both more likely to exit and
receive worse ratings. It could also be that lower ratings directly contribute to restaurants exiting;
as Luca (2011) shows, a one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5 to 9 percent increase in
restaurant revenue. We do not attempt to provide a particular interpretation to ratings in this
paper; our objective is to test whether restaurants with lower ratings tend to be closer to the
margin of exit.
B. Minimum wage and restaurant exit
The evidence that higher minimum wages increases the overall likelihood of exit is weak.
(Table 4). Across all restaurants, a one-dollar increase in the minimum wage is associated with a
0.09 percentage point increase in the probability of exit, which represents a 22 percent increase
(Column 1). Within cities, however, the relationship between the minimum wage and exit
becomes less precisely estimated, suggesting that minimum wages tend to be higher in cities
with higher exit rates (Column 2), and does not reach statistical significance in most of the
specifications. When we include restaurant fixed effects to account for potential unobserved firm
heterogeneity, the coefficient on the minimum wage is positive but imprecisely estimated, again
indicating that the overall likelihood of exit for a restaurant is not significantly impacted by a
minimum wage hike. The estimate remains imprecise when we include time-varying county

15

characteristics that may influence both minimum wage policy and restaurant demand, cityspecific time trends, and county-year fixed effects (Columns 4 and 5)
Overall impacts could mask underlying heterogeneous effects if the minimum wage
differentially affects restaurants of varying quality. To examine this, we include the interaction
effect between a restaurant’s rating and the minimum wage, as specified in Equation (2). Table 5
reports the main results of our paper: the minimum wage increases the likelihood of exit, but the
impact falls for higher-rated restaurants. In all specifications – with or without restaurant fixed
effects – the negative sign on the interaction term indicates that the impact of the minimum wage
increases for lower rated restaurants. When we include city and price category fixed effects, the
estimates suggest that the likelihood of exit of the median 3.5-star restaurant is approximately
0.04 percentage points (=0.11-3.5*0.02), or 10 percent higher after the minimum wage increases
by $1 (p-value < 0.05). For a 5-star restaurant, the impact falls to close to approximately zero
(0.01 percentage points) and not statistically different from zero. The magnitude of the
coefficients increases when we include restaurant fixed effects.
Based on the estimates in Column 5, the results would suggest that the impact of a $1 rise
in the minimum wage would increase the likelihood of exit for the median restaurant by around
0.04 percentage points, which is approximately 10 percent (from a mean likelihood of exit of
0.4) and statistically significant at the 10 percent level. For a 5-star restaurant, this impact is in
fact negative (-0.03 percentage points), suggesting the likelihood of exit decreases as the
minimum wage increases for high rated restaurants, although the estimate is not statistically
distinguishable from zero.
Our average effects results are directionally consistent (though a smaller magnitude) than
Aaronson et al. (2018), who find that a 10 percent raise in the minimum wage increases firm exit
16

by approximately 25 percent from a base of 5.7 percent for limited service restaurants, using
QCEW data and a border discontinuity design. However, our results show that lower quality
businesses are much more sensitive than the average business.

V. Further investigation
A. Are results driven by restaurant prices?
If ratings are systematically correlated with prices – e.g., if cheap restaurants tend to
receive low ratings, and expensive restaurants high ratings – then the effects of restaurant prices
and ratings could be confounded. Further, it could be minimum wages are less binding for higher
end full service restaurants, i.e., more expensive restaurants already pay wages above the
minimum, and hence are less affected by minimum wage hikes. Are the heterogeneous effects
we observe driven by how expensive the restaurant is rather than its rating?
We address this issue in several ways. First, it can be seen that the coefficient on the
interaction term between rating and minimum wage remains negative in Table 5 Column 2,
where we include city and price category dummies. Restaurants with lower ratings are more
likely to exit after a minimum wage increase even within the same price range, suggesting that
the results are not being confounded by the cost of the restaurant. That is, the negative
relationship between rating and exit holds even within cheaper, limited service restaurants where
the minimum wage can be expected to be more binding, as well among higher end full service
restaurants, where the minimum wage is presumably less binding.
Second, we provide a brief analysis of examine the relationship between a restaurant’s
price range and its likelihood of exit (Table 6). Interestingly, a restaurant is more likely to exit if
it belongs to a higher price category. This is consistent with existing evidence that full-service
17

restaurants with average diner checks of over $25 tend to have the lowest profit margins because
of higher overhead and staffing costs (Aaronson, French, and Macdonald, 2008; National
Restaurant Association, 2010).
We next examine the impact of the minimum wage by price range. A priori, one may
expect restaurants in the lower end of the market, such as fast food restaurants, to be affected the
minimum wage more because they are more likely to pay at the minimum wage (Card and
Krueger, 1994). In our data, most fast food or limited service restaurants, such as MacDonald’s,
Subway, and Burger King, fall in the one dollar sign category. When we add the interaction term
of the restaurant’s price range and the minimum wage

∗

to Equation 2

(excluding restaurant fixed effects), the estimates in Table 6 (Columns 2 and 3) indicate that
consistent with the existing literature, higher minimum wages affect lower priced restaurants
more, holding rating constant. For example, for a 3.5-star one-dollar sign restaurant, a $1
increase in the minimum wage increases the likelihood of exit by 0.06 percentage points (0.1570.036-3.5*0.018 = 0.06), or 15 percent (Column 3). In contrast, the impact of falls to 0.02
percentage points (0.157-2*0.036-3.5*0.018 = 0.02), or 5 percent, for a more expensive $2 dollar
sign restaurant at the same rating. Further, consistent with our main results, the coefficient on
∗

remains negative and statistically significant, providing evidence that the

heterogeneous effects observed in Section IV are driven by rating rather than by the cost of the
restaurant. For example, holding the cost of the restaurant at one dollar sign, a $1 raise in the
minimum wage increases the likelihood of exit for a 3.5-star restaurant by 0.06 percentage
points, or 15 percent, but the effect drops to 0.03 percentage points (0.157-0.036-5*0.018 =
0.03), or approximately 8 percent for a higher rated 5-star restaurant in the same price category
of one-dollar sign (Column 3).
18

When we include restaurant fixed effects, the negative interaction effect between the
price range category and the minimum wage diminishes, suggesting there are unobserved
restaurant characteristics that affect both the price range (or type) of the restaurant and likelihood
of exit (Columns 4 to 6). Nonetheless, the interaction effect of minimum wage and rating
remains statistically significant and negative, even when controlling for the interaction effect of
minimum wage and price range.
B. Impact on the cost of food orders
One potential channel through which restaurants may absorb higher minimum wages is
by increasing prices. The impact on prices by restaurant quality may depend on mechanism for
exit effect. If exit is driven by the ability to pass on higher labor costs through to consumers for
thriving businesses, then we may observe higher rated restaurants raise prices more. On the other
hand, if exit is driven by the fact that lower rated businesses are relatively more affected by
minimum wage (perhaps because higher rated restaurants already pay more than the minimum
wage), then we might see lower rated restaurants raise prices more.
We conduct an exploratory analysis of the impact of the minimum wage on prices using
orders data from the food ordering platform Eat24. We find limited evidence that the average
cost of a delivery or pick-up order increased from minimum wage hikes (Table 7 Panel A). Most
studies examining the impact of the minimum wage on price pass-through has found that a 10
percent increase in the minimum wage leads to roughly an increase in prices of 0.5 percent
(MacDonald 2016). Our estimates suggest that the average order total increases from 0.1 percent
to 0.9 percent depending on the specification, but the estimates are mostly imprecisely estimated.
When we examine the impact by restaurant rating, we find that the average cost of a food
order at higher rated restaurants rose less than their lower rated counterparts (Table 7 Panel B).
19

The results suggest that higher rated restaurants increased their menu prices less than lower
related restaurants.10 This holds true even when we include price range fixed effects, meaning for
both expensive and cheaper limited service types restaurants, higher rated restaurants raise their
prices less. One possible explanation is that restaurants with higher ratings are already paying
above the minimum wage and hence are not affected by increases in city-level mandates. It is
also feasible that higher rated restaurants have healthier profit margins to absorb higher labor
costs without needing to increase prices.
C. Impact on entry
A natural follow-up question to our results on exit is the impact of the minimum wage on
entry. Dates on restaurant entry only became regularly recorded by Yelp at the end of 2009, so
we restrict our entry analysis to the post-2010 period. Another issue is that new restaurants may
not show up in Yelp as quickly. To examine entry, we generate a city-level panel dataset based
on our restaurant-level dataset and estimate the analogous version of Equation (1) using the entry
rate as the dependent variable, weighted by the number of restaurants on Yelp in that city.
Table 8 reports the results of this exercise. First, consistent with our restaurant-level
analysis, we find no overall impacts of the minimum wage on exit (Columns 1 to 3). Next, we
find that the entry rate in fact declines with minimum wage increases – depending on the
specification, the entry rate declines by 0.026 to 0.039 percentage points from a base of 0.6
percent from a $1 increase in the minimum wage, corresponding to an approximate 4 to 6

10

It is possible those higher minimum wages increases purchasing power of consumers, and hence result in higher
order totals. If this were the case, orders should increase by rating, which means the estimate on the interaction term
is upward biased. Further, we do not see an increase in the number of orders (results available by request),
suggesting that the results are not driven by increased consumption.

20

percent reduction. The number of restaurants per capita falls as expected, but the estimates are
not statistically significant (Columns 7 to 9).
Our results suggest that higher minimum wages deter entry. One interpretation would be
that an increase in the minimum wage reduces overall firm profits, lessening the incentive to
enter the industry. Previous empirical research on entry has produced mixed findings. Using a
border discontinuity approach and data from Dun and Bradstreet Marketplace files, Rohlin
(2011) finds that minimum wages hikes implemented between 2003 and 2006 discouraged firm
entry – a $1 increase in the minimum wage decreased the share of new establishments in an area
relative to its comparison area by approximately 6 percent. Draca and Machin (2011) find some
suggestive evidence that net entry rates decline after the imposition of a national minimum wage
in the United Kingdom. In contrast, Aaronson et al. (forthcoming) finds that a 10 percent
increase in the minimum wage increases the entry rate by roughly 14 percent from a mean of 8.7
percent using a similar border discontinuity approach and QCEW data. Card and Krueger (1994)
compared the numbers of operating restaurants and the numbers of newly opened McDonald’s
stores in different states over the 1986-1991 period using a difference-in-differences framework,
and they found little evidence that higher minimum wages impacted the rate of new openings or
net number of stores.
D. Impact on survival
In addition to the overall monthly likelihood of exit, we examine the effect of the
minimum wage on restaurant time to exit. Since this relies on accurate coding of entry dates, we
also restrict the analysis to after 2010. We estimate a survival model where the dependent
variable is time to exit in months using a Weibull distribution (Table 9). The coefficients indicate
that overall, the minimum wage increases the hazard rate, but the estimates are not statistically
21

significant (Column 1). However, when we interact the minimum wage with the restaurant’s
rating, we can see that the coefficient on the interaction term is negative and statistically
significant, suggesting that the speed to exit is accelerated for poorly rated restaurants (Column
2).
VI. Robustness checks
A. Specifying rating non-linearly
In this section, we present results from several exercises to test the robustness of our
results. First, we relax the assumption of the constant marginal effect of rating. To examine this,
we present results where we specify rating to be (1) as a binary variable indicating whether it is
above the median rating in the city and (2) as categorical values. When we consider using the
above/below median delineation, the results are consistent: the minimum wage increases the
likelihood of exit for restaurants with below median ratings, but the effect largely diminishes for
restaurants with above median ratings (Table 10 Panel A). When we enter rating as categorical
dummies, with ratings less than 2.5 as the base, the results are also consistent, with the likelihood
of exit decreasing as rating goes up (Panel B). Finally, we enter the minimum wage as a binary
variable, which equals to 1 if the city’s variable is higher than the state mandate (Panel C),
interacted with the above median dummy, which also yields consistent results.
B. Specifying price range non-linearly
Similarly, we provide results where the price range is specified as categorical dummies
rather than a linear variable (Table 11). The results are consistent with those in Table 6. Overall,
more expensive restaurants are more likely to go out of business at any point in time. However,
the minimum wage disproportionately affects cheaper restaurants. At the same time, higher rated

22

restaurants are more shielded from minimum wage shocks. This holds true whether we specify
use city or restaurant fixed effects.
C. Using a static snapshot of rating
In our main model, rating is time-varying, meaning that a restaurant’s rating may change
over time. One question that may arise, however, is how much of the effect we observe is driven
by the restaurant’s rating changing over time, versus the change in the minimum wage. In other
words, are restaurants with worse ratings pushed to exit because of the minimum wage, or do
higher labor costs exert downward pressures on a restaurant’s quality and ratings as well, leading
it to decline in reputation and exit? To shed light on this question, we use a static snapshot of
rating, captured at the midpoint of the restaurant’s life-cycle (calculated as halfway between the
first and last review; we use the midpoint value to allow the restaurant time to gain a foothold in
the market, but not too close to the end of the panel). By using a static snapshot of a restaurant’s
rating, the results help isolate the variation in minimum wage. The results are qualitatively
consistent, but smaller in magnitude (Table 12), suggesting one mechanism through which
minimum wages increase exit is perhaps by depressing service or food quality.
VII. Discussion
We find considerable and predictable heterogeneity in the effects of the minimum wage,
and that the impact on exit is concentrated among lower quality restaurants, which are already
closer to the margin of exit. We also provide suggestive evidence that the minimum wage drives
lower rated restaurants to increase prices. Here, we provide a back-of-the-envelope exercise to
interpret our findings in the context of restaurant industry statistics. Approximately one-third of a
restaurant’s expenses are on payroll (National Restaurant Association, 2010). Assuming that half
of a restaurant’s payroll will be affected by the minimum wage, so that one-sixth of restaurant
23

costs are spent on the wages of minimum wage workers. If the minimum wage increases by 10
percent, then profits will fall by close to 2 percent. The average profit margin of a restaurant
ranges from 2 to 5 percent, and will be presumably closer to the low end for low rated
restaurants. This provides further support for our interpretation, highlighting that recent
minimum wage increases lead to economically meaningful cost shocks for restaurants. Theory
models that allow for firms with heterogeneous productivity should suggest that a minimum
wage increase would act to truncate firms from the lower end of the distribution (Butcher,
Dickens, and Manning 2012; Card et al.2016; Draca et al. 2011; Eckstein and Wolpin 1990).
Our findings suggest directions for future research. First, because most minimum wage
changes in our sample are relatively new, our results may be capturing short-run effects. Second,
it is unclear what happens to employees after a business closes. For example, they could move to
higher rated restaurants, switch industries, or become unemployed. For example, higher rated
restaurants may hire some of the employees from the lower rated businesses exiting the market.
Third, our results raise the possibility that higher rated restaurants may adjust to higher minimum
wages through other channels. Our analysis using delivery order data provide suggestive
evidence that poorly rated restaurants may respond to minimum wage hikes by increasing prices.
Other potential responses may include substituting toward higher productivity workers (Horton,
2017), especially if higher quality restaurants are able to assortatively match with more
productive workers (Eeckhout and Kircher, 2011; Epstein and Wolpin, 1990; Mendes et al.,
2010).
A large literature has now documented that firms exhibit considerable variation in
productivity and management practices. Moreover, there is growing evidence that management
practices can be improved through interventions ranging from connecting businesses with each
24

other (Cai and Szeidl 2018) to professional consulting (Bloom et al 2013). Our results find that
lower rated businesses are much more likely to exit, and are much more sensitive to the cost
shocks associated with a minimum wage increase. This raises policy questions about whether
these firms are optimizing, given outside options, or whether there is scope to help improve the
practices of low-performing businesses.
Lastly, our results also demonstrate the potential for digital exhaust from online platforms
to complement standard data sources to provide unique insight in policy evaluations. The
strength of data from online platforms is that they might provide dependent variables that are
more granular and closer to real time, as well as independent variables that provide insight into
dimensions of markets that were previously unobservable (Glaeser et al., forthcoming). Our
analysis provides a case study in this, showing how digital data from Yelp can further our
understanding of the impacts of the minimum wage. However, questions remain about how
representative of such data and how selection may bias results. Further research is needed to
understand the representativeness of data from digital platforms and the implications of using
such data for policy analysis.

Note: This figure plots the simple means of the residuals from regressing the likelihood of exit on city
dummies at each rating, when the minimum wage equal to the state mandate (“MW=base”), compared to
when the minimum wage is equal or exceeds 20 percent above the state mandate (“MW 20% higher than
state”).
