Over the last 20 years, general equilibrium models of international trade featuring increasing returns to scale have revitalized the international trade research agenda. Yet general equilibrium
econometric work remains underdeveloped: it has been scarce, only occasionally well-informed
by theory, and almost always devoid of economically-meaningful alternative hypotheses. There
are exceptions of course. These include Helpman (1987), Hummels and Levinsohn (1993, 1995),
Brainard (1993, 1997), Harrigan (1993, 1996), and Davis and Weinstein (1996). However, this list
is as short as the work is hard. The complexity of general equilibrium, increasing returns to scale
predictions has deflected empirical research of the kind that is closely aligned with theory.
Surprisingly, one empirically tractable prediction remains overlooked, despite the fact that it is
central to the approach of Helpman and Krugman (1985). We are referring to a variant of Vanek’s
(1968) factor content of trade prediction. In its Helpman-Krugman form the factor content of trade
depends critically on the extent of scale returns in each industry. Scale matters because it determines both the pattern of trade and the amount of factors needed to produce observed trade flows.
As Helpman and Krugman showed, their variant of the Vanek prediction comes out of a very large
set of increasing returns models and so provides a robust way of evaluating these models. Yet remarkably, this increasing returns to scale factor content prediction has not been explored empirically. We know that the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek factor content prediction performs poorly e.g.,
Trefler (1995). Yet there has not been one iota of evidence that the Helpman-Krugman class of
models performs better. Exploring this uncharted region is our first goal.
The second and more important goal of this paper is to quantify the extent of increasing returns
to scale in the context of a general equilibrium model of international trade. This forces us to part

1

company with the existing scale literature which focuses on estimating scale effects separately for
each industry. Instead, we must seek a radically different general equilibrium strategy. It is as
follows. The Helpman-Krugman variant of the Vanek prediction imposes a precise relationship
between the elasticities of scale in each industry and a particular set of data on trade, technology,
and factor endowments. We search for elasticities of scale that make this relationship fit best. Like
cosmologists searching the heavens for imprints of the big bang, we are searching the historical
record on trade flows for imprints of scale as a source of comparative advantage.
There are two reasons why 15 years of research has largely escaped exposure to general equilibrium econometric work. As noted, one is the complexity of general equilibrium predictions. The
other is the lack of the internationally comparable cost data needed to make inferences about scale.
Surprisingly, both problems are resolved by shifting the focus from trade in goods to the factor content of trade. Comparative costs are so obviously the basis of international trade that no amount of
evidence to the contrary would dislodge this view. That is, trade flows from low-cost exporters to
high-cost importers. It should therefore be possible to use trade flow data to make inferences about
international cost differences. What makes this possibility so attractive is that detailed trade flow
data are available even where no cost data exist. Factor content calculations transparently structure
the problem of inferring costs from trade data. Remember that the factor content of trade is just a
set of derived demands for the factor inputs used to produce observed trade flows. By Shephard’s
lemma, these demands can be integrated back to obtain costs. That is, factor content predictions
provide a way of inferring international cost differences from trade flows.
Just as you cannot squeeze water from a stone, you cannot infer costs without extensive data.

2

For this paper we have constructed a new and remarkable database covering all internationally
traded, goods-producing industries (27 in manufacturing and 7 outside of manufacturing) for 71
countries over the period 1972-1992. The database contains bilateral trade and gross output by industry, country, and year as well as factor endowments by country and year. The most difficult part
of this project has been the two years spent on database construction.
Our conclusions are as follows. When restricting all industries to have the same scale elasticity
our method yields a precisely estimated scale elasticity of 1.05. This is small for mark-up models (Rotemberg and Woodford 1992), arguably large for endogenous growth models, and certainly
large for hysteretic models. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among industries. For
about a third of all industries the data are not sufficiently informative for making inferences about
scale. For another third of all industries, we estimate constant returns to scale. That is, allowing for
scale in these industries does not add much to our understanding of the cost basis for trade flows.
For the remaining third of all industries, including such industries as pharmaceuticals and machinery, we find strong evidence of increasing returns to scale. For this group, our general equilibrium
scale estimates have a modal range of 1.10-1.20. Scale is central to understanding trade for these
industries.
At this stage, an important caveat is in order. We will be working with industry-level data, not
plant-level data. Thus, we will be finding a relationship between industry output and trade-revealed
industry costs. This relationship may be partly induced by underlying plant-level scale economies.
However, it may also be induced by industry-level externalities (e.g., Paul and Siegel 1999) and,
for the most technologically dynamic industries, by new process technologies that are embodied in

3

an increased scale of operation (e.g., Rosenberg 1982, 1994). To smooth the exposition, we use the
term ‘scale’ to include both the many familiar sources of scale as well as industry-level externalities
and scale-biased technical change. Whence the ‘All That’ of our title. This point is developed in
section 3.4.
The reader with no trade interests may want to skip section 1 (a data preview) and skim section
2 (trade theory and econometric identification). The estimating equation appears in section 2.4
(equation 12). The core empirical work appears in section 3, especially tables 3 and 4. Sensitivity
analysis appears in section 4.

1. Preliminaries
1.1. The Data
The database constitutes one of the most, if not the most, comprehensive descriptions of the global
trading environment ever assembled. Its construction consumed two years of intensive work. The
data have four dimensions. (i) Countries. There are 71 countries covering the entire development
spectrum. See appendix table A.1 for a list of countries. (ii) Industries. There are 34 industries covering virtually the entire tradeables or goods-producing sector. 27 of these are 3-digit ISIC manufacturing industries. The remaining industries are non-manufacturing industries ranging from livestock to electricity generation. A list of industries appears in the tables below. (iii) Factors. There
are 11 factors: capital stock (Summers and Heston 1991), 4 levels of educational attainment (Barro
and Lee 1993), 3 energy stocks (coal reserves, oil and gas reserves, and hydroelectric potential),
and 3 types of land (cropland, pasture, and forests). (iv) Years. There are 5 years: 1972, 1977,

4

1982, 1987, and 1992.
The database contains the following: (i) deflated bilateral trade and deflated gross output by
country, industry, and year, (ii) factor endowments and income by country and year, and (iii)
double-deflated input-output relations by year for the United States. See appendix A for database
details. Finer details will appear as a separate paper when the database is made publicly available.

1.2. Data Preview
The single most important fact supporting the use of increasing returns models is the presence of
intra-industry trade, that is, of trade in similar products. Models by Krugman (1979), Helpman
(1981), and Ethier (1982) were designed to explain such trade. (Though note that Davis (1995,
1997) provides Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin explanations of intra-industry trade.) Figure 1 plots
each country’s 1992 imports and exports of Instruments against its output of the Instruments industry (ISIC 385). A country’s imports from the rest of the world appear as a point above the axis
and a country’s exports to the rest of the world appear below the axis. Imports, exports, and output are scaled by the country’s gross domestic product (gdp). The main point about the picture is
that countries with large imports also have large exports. This is intra-industry trade and has been
well-documented. What is surprising is how extensive it is both for large and small producers. This
may be the graphical counterpart to Hummels and Levinsohn’s (1993, 1995) result about how well
monopolistic competition models perform for poor countries. Another surprise is the mirror-like
quality across the horizontal axis. Some of this is entrepôt trade as in the case of Singapore, but
symmetry extends to all countries. One gets no sense of the specialization that lies at the heart of
theories of comparative advantage. A possible explanation is offshore sourcing of parts, a phe5

nomenon which we term ‘intra-mediate’ trade.
Does this pattern hold for bilateral trade as well? Figure 2 plots bilateral trade in instruments
for cases where the U.S. is the importer (top panel) or exporter (bottom panel). For example, the
‘HKG’ observation in the upper right plots U.S. imports from Hong Kong against Hong Kong output. The data are scaled by the gdp of the (non-U.S.) producer country. Remarkably, symmetry
persists even at the bilateral level. Another feature of the data is a point made by Harrigan (1996).
The bilateral monopolistic competition model predicts that country i’s imports from country j will
be proportional to j’s output (Helpman and Krugman 1985). Harrigan re-writes this as a log regression of bilateral imports on output, that is, as the regression line plotted in the top panel of figure



2 (though without gdp scaling). He obtains a slope of 1.2 and an R of 0.7. The similar figure 2



statistics - a slope of 1.4 and an R of 0.5 - reinforce how robust Harrigan’s results are. An odd
feature stemming from symmetry is that the regression line in the bottom panel of figure 2 also fits



well (a slope of 0.6 and an R of 0.4). This means that the United States exports instruments to
big producers of instruments. This is not a prediction that comes out of the standard monopolistic competition model. It is consistent with multinational sourcing of intermediate parts (Brainard
1993, 1997 and Feenstra and Hanson 1996a, 1996b, 1997).
Increasing returns models often predict extreme patterns of specialization and regional concentration of industry. A measure of regional concentration is the Herfindahl index defined as
where





is country  ’s share of world production of good  . Table 1 reports the Herfindahl index

for 1992. Note from the ‘1992-1972’ column that the index has fallen over time in almost all industries. This is the globalization trend that has received so much attention. The most simplistic

6

model of scale returns predicts that increasing returns to scale industries will be geographically specialized and thus appear at the top of the table 1 list. Not surprisingly, Instruments and Machinery
appear near the top. Footwear and Leather Products - a priori constant returns industries - appear
near the bottom of the list as expected. The table reports three commonly used, albeit weak, proxies
of scale. These are described in the notes to table 1. There is a weak correlation between these measures and the Herfindahl index. Further inspection of the table reveals unexpected industries near
the top and bottom of the list. Coal Mining and Pulp and Paper are natural resource- or endowmentbased industries. Their position near the top is consistent with scale returns as well as with the
Heckscher-Ohlin model. We also constructed Krugman’s (1991) population-scaled Herfindahl index. By this measure natural resource-based industries topped the list of regionally concentrated
industries. Clay and Cement Products bottom out the list because of high transport costs. Thus,
scale returns in its simplest form explains some of the regional concentration of production, but
endowments, trade restrictions, and transport costs also contribute.

2. Theory and Estimating Equation
2.1. The Vanek Prediction with Increasing Returns to Scale
Vanek’s factor content prediction transparently structures the problem of inferring unavailable cost
and scale-elasticity information from available trade flow data. In this section we review the wellknown observation that Vanek’s factor content prediction may hold for both constant and increasing returns to scale technologies (Helpman and Krugman 1985). We then follow Trefler (1996) in
deriving a definition of the factor content of trade that is theoretically consistent with existing data.

The Vanek prediction is a prediction of the form "$#

Appendix B provides a simple derivation of equation (1). Aside from using factor market-clearing,
the derivation is purely algebraic and based entirely on manipulation of input-output identities. For
our purpose, which is to consistently estimate scale elasticities, we do not need to interpret equations (1)-(3). All we will need is that the residuals W

# satisfy a familiar econometric orthogonality

condition. However, equation (1) does have an interpretation. Under the strong assumption that

W #  3 , equation (1) is the Vanek prediction. By way of an extended aside, we turn to this interpretation.

observation that the Vanek prediction holds for a large class of increasing returns to scale models
is one of the central insights in Helpman and Krugman (1985).2
There is a potential disconnect between our industry-level empirical work and the models of
the previous paragraph which feature internal returns to scale. One issue is whether with internal
returns to scale there will be an industry-level relationship between output and output per unit of
input. The answer is yes. The only exception is the CES utility case, but as Lancaster (1984) and
many others have noted, one does not want to take this case seriously for empirical work. A second issue is whether our industry-level data allow us to distinguish between internal and external

Note that in the absence of trade in intermediate inputs, the condition h(i7j mqu ih&wj is just the regression line
plotted in the top panel of figure 2 and examined so thoroughly by Harrigan (1996). This follows from the facts that
output i equals world demand h wi and consumption h i:j equals imports  i:j . Plugging i m h wi and h i:j m  i7j
into h i7j mYu i h w[j yields  i:j mYu i j . Thus, h i7j mYu i h w[j is implicit in much of the literature on monopolistic

returns to scale. Here the answer is no. This is the point of the ‘all that’ in our title and of the ‘What
is Scale?’ section below. At first glance it seems unusual that we do not need to distinguish between internal and external returns to scale. After all, they are very different in their implications
for market structure, the location of production, and trade patterns. The remarkable insight that
pervades Helpman and Krugman (1985) is that the form of scale returns has only very modest implications for the factor content of trade. Thus, while predictions about the location of production
and the pattern of trade are often complicated, model-dependent, and/or just plain indeterminate
in this class of models, predictions about the factor content of trade are relatively straightforward.
This is a key reason for why we have chosen the factor content route.
To conclude our discussion of the consumption condition, the interpretation of equation (1) as
a Vanek prediction requires W

#  3 . However, consistent estimation of scale elasticities requires a

weaker condition, namely, a familiar econometric orthogonality condition involving the ‘residual’

W # . We return to this point below.
We turn next to the interpretation of

as to why the equation (3) expression for

# ' P # B 2

Krugman (1985), equation 1.11. That is, producer-country choice of techniques are used to calculate the required factor inputs. With traded intermediates there is a subtle problem associated with
the measurement of P?# . Current practice by all national statistical agencies is to construct P?# by
lumping together the inter-industry purchases of domestically produced and imported intermediate

11

inputs. One needs somehow to net out the imported intermediates. The second term in equation
(3) is the theoretically correct way of doing this.
In equation (3) it appears as if we are using net trade for the factor content of intermediates
and gross trade for the factor content of final goods. Nothing could be more misleading. The two
bracketed terms in equation (3) are not decomposable in this way. Intermediate input terms such
as P

# ;IH enter equation (3) for the entirely different reason of netting out imported intermediates.

Appendix B develops this point. A more complete discussion appears in Trefler (1996).

2.2. Isolating Scale and Exogenous International Productivity Differences
The Vanek prediction of equation (1) is an implicit relation between trade flows and costs. (By
Shephard’s lemma the P?# are derivatives of cost functions.) It remains to relate costs to the scale
of output. Recall that PQ#

the analysis we start with the simple case of homothetic production functions and no intermediates.
These are reintroduced in the next section.
Homotheticity implies separability of average costs:

We do not observe the derivative in equation (6). Further, when we move to a general equilibrium

all industries. The data requirements will be enormous. We need to cut through this.
It is a commonplace among economists that factor prices are primarily determined by factor
productivity. Following Trefler (1993), we take this observation very seriously by assuming that
The proof of the equality is as follows. Let § i be an input vector, let ¨!© i {ª  be a constant returns production

Turning from primary factor inputs to intermediate inputs, let äå

be the amount of intermedi-

ate input æ demanded per unit of industry  output. Unlike primary factors, we assume that intermediate inputs are costlessly traded internationally. Thus, each intermediate input has a common,
quality-adjusted price internationally. We have extensively examined the empirical possibility of
scale effects associated with intermediate inputs. See Antweiler and Trefler (1997). However, this
substantially complicates the model without offering any additional empirical insights. As a result,
we simplify the exposition by assuming that there are no scale effects associated with intermediate inputs. For example, two cars require twice as many tires as one car. With this, equation (7)

At this point we introduce time subscripts  . From equation (1) we are interested in

# "! is given by equation (2), # "!¹Z ç \ is given by equation (3), and P # "! in equation (3) is given

by equation (11). Note that ç does not vary with time. We find no evidence of this empirically (see
Antweiler and Trefler 1997) and so forego the additional notation.

# "! Z ç \ also depends on the %&# "! . With 71 countries, 11 factors, 5 years, and the normalization %&# ¡V¢ !

'  , there are 3,850 %&# "! . Rather than estimate them, we use %&# "!  `# "! . `# ¡V¢ ! and

plug in data for

`# "! . `# ¡V¢ ! wherever %&# "! appears in equation (12). For labour factors, `# "! is

the average manufacturing wage (from the same source as the output data). For capital we use the
Penn World Table price of capital (Summers and Heston 1991). For cropland we use gdp generated by crops in 1985 per hectare of cropland. For pasture, we use gdp generated by livestock in
1985 per hectare of pasture. Data are from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
Nations (1992, tables 1.4 and 1.6). For forestry, data limitations force us to assume %&#

$! n . For

energy (coal reserves, oil and gas reserves, and hydroelectric potential), endowments and output
are either measured in joules in the source data or we have converted them to joules using internationally recognized converters. Since the conversion to joules is country-specific and already takes
into account international quality differences, the correct assumption for energy is %&#

Three data issues remain before we can examine equation (12). First, following Conway

we need to know the share of trade that is intermediate inputs trade. For example, we observe

B "!< &U B "!H , but not B "!< or B "!H separately. Appendix C details our method for allocating trade into
its intermediate and final goods components. We were initially concerned that our estimates of ç
would be sensitive to our allocation method. This turns out to be a misplaced concern. To persuade
the reader of this, appendix C also reports estimates of scale for many different allocation methods.
We summarize by noting some differences between our general equilibrium approach and existing partial equilibrium approaches to estimating scale returns in a cross-country setting. On the
input side, data on industry-level inputs are notoriously bad or non-existent e.g., labour inputs by
educational attainment. While partial equilibrium approaches must use such data, our approach allows us to use national-level aggregates. These aggregates are typically more reliable. In addition,
our approach easily allows us to model international differences in input productivities i.e., the %&# .
On the output side, we are able to shift some of the burden off of gross output data and onto trade
flow data. Real gross output data suffer a number of serious problems, especially for poorer countries. In contrast, trade flow data are more accurate, measured in dollars, and with the approximate
assumption of equal prices across countries, correspond more directly to physical quantities. Thus,
the general equilibrium approach allows us to exploit alternative and somewhat more reliable data
sources.

the

distributed disturbances with mean zero. We estimate equation (13) using maximum likelihood
(ML), non-linear least squares (NLS), and non-linear two-stage least-squares (NL2SLS) estimators. These are reviewed in the next section.

3.1. Preliminary Estimation
To fix ideas about the specification we start with the strong assumption that all industries exhibit
the same degree of scale economies. We will relax this shortly. We pool across all 71 countries, all
11 factors, and all 5 years to give us *V

+ 3-,

observations. The 5 years are 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987,

and 1992.
Table 2 reports the estimated scale elasticities for a variety of estimators. We start with the ML
and NLS estimators. They are distinguished by their use of exogeneity assumptions. In general
equilibrium almost everything is endogenous including endowments of physical and human capi-

19

tal. Minimizing endogeneity bias would seem to require treating the most mis-measured variables
as left-hand side variables. (This is informally supported by Klepper and Leamer 1984). National
endowments and the data used to construct the %&#

"!

strike us as fitting the bill. For example, the

capital stock data and quality-adjusted measures of education stocks are troublesome. Therefore,
for the purposes of ML and NLS estimation, we treat %&#
variable and

"! "$# "! 2 - "! + 6 %&# 6.! "$# 6.!

as a left-hand side

# "!¹Z ç \ as a right-hand side variable. From row (1) of table 2, the ML estimate is 1.051

and the NLS estimate is 1.050. The other estimated parameters of the model are the variance and
GLS parameters. These appear in appendix table A.3. Although not reported in table 2, similar
results obtain without the %&#

"!

or fixed effects. The %&#

"! 

ML estimate is 1.043 and the no-fixed

effect ML estimate is 1.054. See Antweiler and Trefler (1997) for additional specifications.
One null hypothesis is that there exists scale returns (H/10Sç

0

 ) and that the Helpman-

Krugman variant of the Vanek factor content prediction is ‘true.’ An explicit alternative hypothesis
is that there are constant returns to scale (H/20çl ), in which case our model reduces to the usual
Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek factor content prediction. The ML  -statistic of 13.41 is for the hypothesis çX

 . The  -statistic tells us that the data favour the Helpman-Krugman, increasing-returns

framework over the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model. This is a novel and important general equilibrium result.
The ML estimate treats

# $! Z ç \ as exogenous. We examine endogeneity by using instrumental

variables methods. The ‘ 3IT

#  ! Ý 4 Z ç \ ’ columns use a standard Amemiya (1974) NL2SLS estimator with # "! Z ç \ instrumented by its lagged value #  ! Z ç \ . (The NL2SLS minimand appears
Ý4
in appendix E.) The longer is the lag 5 , the more likely is the instrument to be orthogonal to the

20

error. Recalling that we have data for 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992, the longest possible lag is
20 years. However, the longer the lag, the fewer are the observations left for estimation. Given the
poor small-sample properties of IV estimators (Nelson and Startz 1990), we prefer to use a 15-year
lag. In this case,

Z #  6#7  #  8  \ is instrumented by Z #  7   #  77 \ . Row (2) reports the results for

15-year lags. This leaves us with

N:9ûN@ _ ,<; observations. The NL2SLS estimate of

1.095 is significantly larger than the NLS estimate of 1.044 in that the estimators’ 1% confidence
intervals are non-overlapping. This is the basis for a Hausman exogeneity test. While the Hausman
statistic is negative, it seems likely that exogeneity would be rejected by a refined test that takes
into account the correlation between the two estimators. We have not attempted this.
We also considered a larger instrument set constructed from polynomials of the instrument

#  ! Ý 4 . In rows (2)-(4), the instrument set is = Z #  ! Ý 4 \.>@?@>A F  where B
in row (3), and B



 in row (2), B

C*

 , in row (4). See the ‘B ’ column in table 2. As is apparent, the results are

insensitive to the size of the instrument set.
Table 2 also reports results for different lag lengths. In rows (5)-(7), we consider the shorter
lag length of 10 years (

D*<E* observations). In rows (8)-(10), we consider the longer lag length of

20 years ( 9<FV observations). The results are insensitive to the choice of lag length.
NL2SLS with our lagged instrument set is dominated in efficiency terms by NL2SLS with an
instrument set based on

$!È. ç . The ¥ # $!t. ¥ ç are the fitted values of ¥ # "!|. ¥ ç from a prelimi¥ # ¥

¥ # ¥
are the same as for the ‘ 3,, #  ! Z ç \ ’ instrument set. Note that for B _ , the two NL2SLS

21

estimates are mathematically equivalent.
The bottom line from table 2 is that there is evidence of modest scale economies at the aggregate level no matter how one tackles estimation. The elasticity estimate of 1.051 is well within the
bounds of what has been reported in the U.S. time series literature (e.g., Basu 1995 and Basu and
Fernald 1997). Against our conclusion of statistically significant scale returns must be weighed the
economically small size of the estimated ç . A 1% rise in output is associated with a 0.05% fall in
average costs. Further, a country operating at a tenth of U.S. levels has only 14% higher average
costs.8 Of course, in dynamic models such as those displaying endogenous growth and especially
hysteresis, ç­

 3-,  can have important consequences.

The factor demand implications of

ç 

 3-,  are much larger than the average cost impli-

cations. From equation (8), the elasticity of factor demand per unit of output is à . From the last
footnote, ç­ 3-,

 implies à1 3 HF . That is, a 1% rise in output leads to a 0.18% fall in demand

for primary inputs per unit of output. Further, a country operating at a tenth of U.S. output levels
uses 51%

Z   3 JÝ I 6 2  \ more productivity-adjusted factor inputs per unit of output. Thus, from

the perspective of factor endowments theory even this small scale estimate is very important. We
will see that it has some implications for the ‘mystery of missing trade’ (Trefler 1995).

3.2. Industry-Level Analysis
General equilibrium estimation is complicated. We have found it computationally infeasible to
simultaneously estimate separate scale elasticities for all 34 industries. Fortunately, there are other
paths to interesting results. Consider the following iterative three-step procedure:
1. Rank industries by the size of their scale elasticities. In the first iteration this ranking is based
on external information. In subsequent iterations it is taken from the output of the previous
iteration.
2. Pick a particular industry  , place all industries higher in the ranking in one group and all
industries lower in the ranking in another group. Industry  sits in a separate, third group.
Use ML to estimate equation (13) subject to the restriction that all industries within a group

G

share a common scale elasticity. This yields scale estimates çVUXW

G

G

 U , ç <Y[Z , and ç Z  \ for the

high, low, and  groups, respectively.9
3. Repeat step 2 for each  . This yields a set of scale estimates
using

= çG Z  \? \ ^F 

= çG Z  \?]\^F  .

Return to step 1

to rank industries.

Since the choice of initial rank does not matter, we defer description of this choice to the ‘Sensitivity
Analysis’ section. In that section we also note that there are no algorithm convergence issues.
Table 3 reports the ç

for the specification with 71 countries, 11 factors, and 5 years. In the

table industries are classified into four groups. The increasing returns to scale (IRS) group contains
those industries with ç

that are significantly greater than unity at the 1% level. (Instruments is

an exception, but we include it because it is significant in every other specification examined in
the ‘Sensitivity Analysis’ section.) We distinguish between manufacturing and natural resources
because the natural resource scale estimates may reflect not only scale, but also Heckscher-Ohlin
misspecification. The constant returns to scale (CRS) group contains those industries with ç

G \
Z

that

are insignificantly different from unity at the 1% level. In a few cases, such as electricity where

G

ç Z  \  3 E and  3  ; 9 , being in the CRS group really means that scale returns are imprecisely
estimated. The ‘Non-Robust’ group collects industries for which scale is not robustly estimated.
Robustness will be made precise in the ‘Sensitivity Section’ section below.
Table 3 shows a number of striking patterns. First, the constant returns to scale industries are
all sensible. These include Apparel, Leather, and Footwear. Second, the industries estimated to
display scale returns are also all sensible. These include Pharmaceuticals, Electric and Electronic
Machinery, and Non-Electrical Machinery.
To get a handle on magnitudes, consider a scale elasticity of 1.15. This implies that a 1% rise
in output leads to a 0.13% fall in average cost. Further, a country operating at a tenth of U.S. levels
faces 55% higher average costs. These are large numbers.
How do our results compare to existing partial equilibrium production function-based estimates? Tybout (2000) surveyed studies for many developing countries and found little evidence
of scale returns. This is a key finding. He partly attributed it to the fact that “small firms in developing countries tend not to locate in those industries where they would be at substantial cost
disadvantage relative to larger incumbents” (Tybout 2000, page 19). This squares readily with our
finding of constant returns to scale in all low-end manufacturing industries. The evidence of scale

24

from middle-income countries is less clear cut. Using Chilean plant-level data for 8 industries,
Levinsohn and Petrin (1999) estimated scale returns from value-added production functions that
are never less than 1.20 and reach as high 1.44. Using Mexican plant-level data, Tybout and Westbrook (1995) obtained almost no evidence of scale for large plants. It is not immediately clear
that our results are inconsistent with Tybout and Westbrook: we find constant returns for many industries and increasing returns primarily for industries not examined by them. For rich countries,
Harrigan (1999) found no evidence of scale in cross-country regressions. However, many other
OECD country studies point clearly to the existence of scale returns. Paul and Siegel (1999) estimated industry-level scale returns in the range of 1.30 for many U.S. manufacturing industries.
Estimates closer to our mode of 1.15 are common in OECD studies e.g., Fuss and Gupta (1981)
for Canada and Griliches and Ringstad (1971) for Norway. Thus, our general equilibrium results
are consistent with some, though not all of the existing partial equilibrium benchmarks.

3.3. Grouped Results
A drawback to the approach of the last section is that we did not simultaneously estimate each
industry’s scale elasticity. The estimation algorithm is only partially simultaneous. Further, we
did not deal with endogeneity. To address these issues we follow table 3 in classifying industries
into three groups: IRS, CRS, and Non-Robust.10 We then estimate the model under the assumption
that scale elasticities are the same within each group, but different between groups. Note that the
IRS group includes both manufacturing and natural resource-based IRS industries. Disaggregation
10

The classification of industries into these 3 groups is slightly different from that reported in table 3. This is a minor
point; however, we cannot properly explain it until after we have laid out the criteria for being in the ‘Non-Robust’
group. See the ‘Sensitivity Analysis’ section below.

25

of the IRS group into manufacturing and natural resources adds little to the analysis.
The top panel of table 4 reports the results for the usual specification with 71 countries and 11
factors. The NL2SLS estimator uses the preferred instrument set from row 3 of table 2. That is, it
uses the

#  ! Ý 4 Z ç \ instrument set with a B

c* polynomial order and a 15-year lag length. This

leaves us with only the years 1987 and 1992. We do not report any of the other specifications that
appeared in table 2 since this would be too repetitive. Instead, we report the results for the sample
consisting only of our 23 OECD members. (See table A.1 for a list of these countries and the end
of appendix A for a discussion of how the world is defined with 23 countries.) From the bottom
panel of table 4, the 23-country results are very similar to the 71-country results, though somewhat
less significant. The reduced significance arises from having eliminated an important source of
sample variation, namely, trade with non-OECD countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore. For
23 countries, the Hausman d



 test statistic of 490 strongly supports the hypothesis of endogeneity.

The conclusions from table 4 are clear. The IRS group is always estimated to have significant
scale returns. As in table 2, the NL2SLS estimate is larger than its ML counterpart which assume
exogeneity. The CRS group is always estimated to have a scale elasticity that is insignificantly
different from unity. For the Non-Robust group, almost by definition, the conclusion depends on
the estimation method. Overall, the table 4 results are wholly consistent with the estimates reported
in tables 2-3. By implication we must abandon empirical models that treat all industries as if they
were subject exclusively to either constant or increasing returns. Both play an important role for
understanding the sources of comparative advantage.

26

3.4. What is Scale?
As discussed in the introduction, we are using scale (and ‘all that’) to mean something more than
just plant-level economies. For one, scale likely includes industry-level externalities. By way of
example, growth of the Petroleum Refining industry was accompanied by the development of a
host of specialized inputs including specialized engineering firms, industry-sponsored institutes,
and specialized machinery manufacturers. Paul and Siegel (1999) argued that more than half of
the relationship between cost and scale in U.S. manufacturing is due to such industry-level externalities. To the extent that this holds worldwide, it implies that a portion of what we are calling
‘scale’ is actually industry-level externalities.
Also, scale likely includes aspects of dynamic international technology differences. In table 3,
the industries with the largest scale estimates are often those where technical change has been most
rapid e.g., Pharmaceuticals. New goods often engender new process technologies and these new
process technologies are often embodied in larger plants. As Rosenberg (1982, 1994) has tirelessly
argued:

“In this respect it is much more common than it ought to be to assume that the exploitation of the benefits of large-scale production is a separate phenomenon independent of
technological change. In fact, larger plants typically incorporate a number of technological improvements ...” (Rosenberg 1994, page 199)
While it is important conceptually to distinguish between scale and dynamic technical change, the
fact that technical change is the hand maiden of scale makes this distinction empirically problematic. Even with the unusually detailed McKinsey data, Baily and Gersbach (1995) were forced
to lump international technology differences together with scale as inseparable sources of global
27

competition. In short, for the most dynamic industries, available data do not allow us to distinguish
between scale and scale-biased technical change. This is a critical area for future research.
Is it possible that our scale estimates also capture more traditional or static international technology differences? At the most obvious level the answer is no. Our

%&# explicitly capture the

most important static international technology differences. A more subtle approach to answering
the question is as follows. Suppose that country  is particularly efficient at producing a good in
the sense of having a large ratio of output to employment. By Ricardian comparative advantage,
the country will expand output of the industry. Looking across countries for a single industry, the
larger is the level of industry output, the larger is the ratio of output to employment. The careless
researcher will incorrectly attribute this correlation to increasing returns to scale. Obviously we
have not been careless. However, to dispel any possible confusion we make the following observations.
The first observation draws on an analogy between our general equilibrium econometric work
and the econometrics of production functions.11 Static international technology differences can
be thought of as unobserved productivity shocks that effect decisions about both inputs and outputs. They therefore induce endogeneity bias in regressions of output on inputs (e.g., Griliches and
Mairesse 1995). The techniques commonly used to control for unobserved productivity shocks
are fixed effects and IV estimators. These are exactly the econometric techniques we have used
throughout this paper. These techniques provided no evidence that our scale estimates are arti11
We hasten to add that the analogy with partial equilibrium production function estimation only goes so far. In our
general equilibrium setting, observations have a factor dimension and data from all industries enter into each observation. See equation (13).

28

facts of unobserved international productivity differences.12
The second observation about the correct interpretation of our results comes from the crossindustry distribution of our scale estimates. In the Ricardian interpretation, all relatively low-cost
producers are large producers. That is, static international technology differences will masquerade
as scale effects in all industries, be it Pharmaceuticals or Apparel. If so, we should have estimated
significant scale effects in every industry. We found nothing of the sort. To the contrary, we found
strong evidence of constant returns to scale in many industries e.g., Apparel. We thus find the Ricardian interpretation untenable.
To summarize this section, our scale estimates likely capture plant-level scale, industry-level
externalities, and scale-biased technical change. However, the idea that our estimates of increasing
returns to scale are really static international technology differences in disguise has about as much
life in it as old Ricardo himself.

4. Sensitivity Analysis
In assigning industries to the IRS and CRS groups, we have been using a stringent set of criteria:
the inference of increasing or constant returns was required to be robust across a wide variety of
specifications. Industries that did not meet the criteria were unceremoniously dumped into the NonRobust group. This section reviews the sensitivity analysis underlying our robustness criteria. In
12
To the contrary, the IV estimates were sometimes larger than the ML estimates. This IV-ML ranking deserves
further consideration. In a production function setting, endogeneity bias is usually taken to mean that the coefficient
on labour is upward-biased and the coefficient on less variable inputs such as capital are downward biased (Olley and
Pakes 1996). It need not imply that the sum of the coefficients (i.e., the scale elasticity) is upward biased. Indeed,
Levinsohn and Petrin (1999) found that a modified Olley-Pakes solution to endogeneity bias raises the estimate of
scale in 3 of 8 Chilean industries examined. Thus, there is nothing terribly unusual about our IV-ML ranking.

29

the interests of space, the discussion is terse.
There are three issues to be clarified before robustness can be fully defined. The first deals with
whether the results depend on the initial ranking of industries used to kick off the section 3.2 estimation algorithm. Consider table 5. Results in the ‘Initial Rank: Baseline’ column with 71 countries and 11 factors reproduce the table 3 results. A single asterisk indicates that
than unity at the 1% level, two asterisks indicate 

G

ç Z  \ is greater

0e, and three asterisks indicate  0  3 . The

baseline initial rank uses an initial ranking that is an average of industries’ capital-intensity and
skill-intensity ranks. See the last column of table 1. Results in the ‘Initial Rank: Alternative’ column use an initial ranking based on the scale parameters reported in Paul and Siegel (1999).13 The
baseline and alternative initial ranks are very different. The correlation is only 0.13. It is therefore
re-assuring that the scale estimates produced by the two initial ranks are almost identical. That is,
the table 3 results are insensitive to the initial ranking.
The second robustness issue deals with parameter stability across a variety of specifications.
Table 3 reports results for the specification with 71 countries, 11 factors, and 5 years. For robustness, we require similar results from a specification using only the 23 OECD countries in our sample. We also require similar results from a specification that places more weight on capital and
labour and less weight on land and energy i.e., a specification with 7 factors (aggregate land, aggregate energy, capital, and 4 types of labour). The last two columns of table 5 provide the scale
estimates for these two specifications.
13
Paul and Siegel (1999) work at a higher level of aggregation (19 manufacturing industries). We therefore repeated
their scale elasticity values at the disaggregated level (27 manufacturing industries) where necessary. For industries
not covered by Paul and Siegel (7 non-manufacturing industries), we set the scale elasticities to unity. In the case of
ties we used information from the baseline initial rank.

30

Looking across the four table 4 specifications, the following emerges. There is considerable
stability across specifications for the ‘IRS - Manufacturing’ industries and somewhat less stability
for the ‘IRS - Natural Resources’ industries. The least amount of stability is for the ‘Non-Robust’
category. It is composed of industries that display significant increasing returns in one specification and constant returns in another. By definition, the Non-Robust group displays the greatest
instability. Table 5 over-represents instability by omitting the CRS industries listed in table 3. By
definition of the CRS group, its member industries always display constant returns (insignificant

G

ç Z  \ ). Hence scale estimates for this group are very stable across specifications.
Before turning to our last robustness issue we will need to comment on the convergence of
our section 3.2 algorithm. All the results reported in this paper are based on 10 iterations of the
algorithm. To examine convergence, at least for the table 3 specification, we allowed the algorithm
to run the extra two weeks needed to complete 20 iterations. The results were unchanged from those
reported in table 3. Thus, we have restricted ourselves to 10 iterations of the algorithm.
The third and last robustness issue arises from the fact that the estimation algorithm converges
to a cycling pattern for some industries. For example, in the baseline initial rank specification with
71 countries and 11 factors, the Basic Chemicals and Plastic Products industries either both display
increasing returns (as in odd iterations of our algorithm) or both display constant returns (as in even
iterations). Cycling could never happen in traditional industry-by-industry production function estimation and captures in an obvious way the fact that we are estimating scale returns in a general
equilibrium setting. In tables 3 and 5, the cycling industries are added to the Non-Robust group.
In the absence of cycling it does not matter whether we report the 9¹æ or 10¹æ iterations. Thus, for

31

the IRS category we only report the 10¹æ iteration. For those Non-Robust industries that cycle, it
does matter which iteration we report. In order to keep the table manageable, for the Non-Robust
group we report the average value of ç

G \
Z

across the 9¹æ and 10¹æ iterations.

The classification of industries is based on robustness across specifications. However, for a
given specification some of the Non-Robust industries properly belong in the CRS or IRS groups.
In table 5, these CRS and IRS industries are indicated by the absence of an entry and by a f , respectively. These Non-Robust industries are classified accordingly in table 4. For example, in the
table 4 specification with 71 countries, Furniture and Fixtures is included in the CRS group.
We can now explain exactly how industries are classified. For each industry consider the 8
estimates of ç

Z  \ that come from 4 specifications (the 4 column headings in table 5) and 2 iterations

of our algorithm (the 9¹æ and 10¹æ iterations). If all 8 of these
level then the industry is classified as CRS. If all 8 of these

G

G

ç Z  \ are insignificant at the 1%

ç Z  \ always exceed unity and do so

significantly at least once, then the industry is classified as IRS. If the industry fails to meet either
criteria then it is classified as Non-Robust.14 This scheme ensures that only the most robust results
appear in the CRS and IRS groups.
To conclude, table 5 pointedly illustrates two important features of our work. First, for about
a third of all industries, the data are simply not informative about scale economies. These are the
industries that appear in the Non-Robust group. Second, our criteria for classifying an industry as
CRS or IRS is that the inference about scale is the same across many different specifications. For
14
This classification criterion is for manufacturing industries. For natural resource-based industries the criterion is
the same except that we omit from consideration the specification with 71 countries and 7 factors. With energy and
land endowments so heavily aggregated, the 7-factor data convey very little information about natural resource-based
industries. This can be seen from table 5.

32

these industries, the inference about scale is remarkably robust.

5. Trade and Wages
We have been assuming that scale effects are the same across factors. This masks non-homotheticities such as skill-biased scale effects. With factor non-homotheticities scale is more difficult to
estimate, but the elasticity of unit factor demand à#

¥

'n2

remains a straightfor-

ward concept.15 To examine factor non-homotheticities we drop our prevailing assumption that

àÕ# is independent of  and instead assume that it is independent of  .
Table 6 reports the ML estimates of à# for the specification with 71 countries and 5 years. There
are only 355 observations. We do not report the instrumental variables estimates since in all cases
the Hausman test easily rejects endogeneity. The table evidences substantial non-homotheticities
across factors. A 1% rise in output leads to a fall of 0.21% in the demand for high school dropouts per unit of output and a rise of 0.21% in the demand for high school graduates. That is, the
ratio of skilled to unskilled labour rises by an enormous 3

disaggregated we see the same pattern magnified. Larger output is associated with skill-biased
demand. In their detailed study of the telecommunications industry, Denny and Fuss (1983) also
found skilled-biased output effects.
Skill-biased output effects have important implications for the trade-and-wages debate. To the
extent that trade leads to specialization and greater output, it also leads to relatively greater demand

and Hanson (1996a,b) picture of offshore sourcing as a cause of rising earnings inequality.

6. The Case of the Missing Trade and Other Mysteries
The fully simultaneous model that we have presented is sparsely parameterized: it has only three
scale parameters. It is thus not surprising that we do not dramatically revitalize the HOV model.
Consider the specification with 71 countries, 11 factors, and 5 years from the first row of table 4.
We use three statistics to evaluate it: (i) Trefler’s (1995) ‘missing trade’ statistic; (ii) the correlation
between the factor content of trade and its endowment predictor; and, (iii) the Bowen et al. (1987)
sign test. For the unmodified model (constant returns and %&#

"! ÿ ), the three statistics are 0.003,

0.14, and 0.67, respectively. For the modified model with three groups and %&#

"! 
> 

(row 1 of table

4) the statistics are 0.117, 0.40, and 0.66, respectively. That is, there is a significant improvement
in the missing trade and correlation statistics. Much of the improvement in the correlation statistic comes from introducing the
both the %&#

"!

%&# "! . The improvement in the missing trade statistic comes from

and the scale parameters. It is clear why there is less missing trade. As noted at the

end of section 3.1, even small scale estimates translate into large international differences in the
factor inputs needed per unit of output. It is interesting that the missing trade statistic improves
most for skilled labour (secondary and post-secondary education) and not at all for workers with
no education.

34

7. Conclusions
Do scale economies contribute to our understanding of the factor content of trade? To answer
this question we examined Helpman and Krugman’s variant of the Vanek factor content prediction.
The prediction is particularly interesting in that it arises from a large class of general equilibrium,
increasing returns to scale models. To examine the prediction, we proposed an estimating equation
that is tightly allied to the theory. The equation embodies three determinants of trade: endowments,
exogenous international productivity differences (%&# ), and increasing returns to scale. Admittedly,
this list is incomplete. However, in our quest for truly general equilibrium estimates of scale, the
requirement of tractability forced us to limit our consideration to only these three determinants
of trade. This said, our empirical results strikingly demonstrate that scale economies must figure
prominently for any understanding of the factor content of trade.
We also asked a second question. What does international trade reveal about the extent of scale
economies? Much less of our formal structure was needed to answer this second question. Consistent estimation of scale economies primarily requires a standard orthogonality condition on the

W # of equation (2). While the economics of this condition are not entirely clear, it is no surprise
that less structure is needed for estimator consistency. After all, the guiding empirical insight of
this paper is that trade moves from low-cost exporters to high-cost importers. By implication, trade
data must convey information about costs and scale elasticities.
Just as you cannot squeeze water from a stone, you cannot infer scale without extensive data.
To this end, we constructed a unique and comprehensive database on trade flows, output, and factor endowments for 71 countries over the 1972-92 period. Even with this detailed data, we were

35

unable to completely disentangle the factors underlying our industry-level scale estimates. The
remaining entangled factors are plant-level scale, industry-level externalities and, for the most dynamic industries, scale-biased technical change. This list is the ‘all that’ of our title and a primer
for future research.
Our main conclusions are as follows. (i) We estimated that output expansion is strongly skillbiased. This has important and hitherto unnoticed implications for rising wage inequality. (ii) Pooling across industries, we precisely estimated moderate scale elasticities (ç

d 3-, ). This has im-

portant implications for endogenous growth, particularly since our sample of countries spans the
entire development spectrum. (iii) At least a third of all goods-producing industries display constant returns to scale. For this group, scale does not contribute to our understanding of international
trade. Another third of all goods-producing industries are characterized by increasing returns. The
modal range of scale elasticities for this group is 1.10–1.20. For this group scale is central to our
understanding of the factor content of trade.
Our results point to the importance of integrating constant and increasing returns to scale industries within a single general equilibrium framework. We showed how to implement this empirically. Further, we found that the Helpman-Krugman framework provides a remarkable lens for
viewing the scale elasticities encoded in trade flows. Finally, our results highlight the importance
of scale and ‘all that’ as a source of comparative advantage.

Appendix
A. Data and Their Sources
Data on endowments are constructed as follows. Capital stocks are from Summers and Heston
(1991). When available, we used the capital stock series. Otherwise, we used Leamer’s (1984)
double declining balance method applied to investment. Educational-attainment in the population
is from Barro and Lee (1993). We updated it to 1992. Energy is the sum of joule-equivalent reserves of hard coal, soft coal, crude oil, natural gas, and hydroelectric potential. Data are from the
World Resources Institute diskette and other minor sources. Land is the sum of cropland, pasture,
and forests as reported in FAO diskettes. All endowments are stocks, not flows.
For each country, industry, and year we have assembled data on international trade and production. Table A.1 lists the countries in the database. (South Korea was inadvertently omitted from our
group of 23 OECD countries.) Trade data are from the Statistics Canada “World Trade Database.”
Production data are from the UNIDO INDSTAT production data base, from the UN General Industrial Statistics (including its earlier incarnations), and from other minor sources. Our 34 industries
completely cover the tradeables sector except for metal mining, non-metal mining, and miscellaneous manufacturing. These three have no sensible production data because of aggregation problems. As a result they are included in the analysis, but are treated as constant returns to scale in-

ç   \ so that the estimating equations are independent of their data. We also applied the
l
same ç­ constraint to the Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas industry for the 23-country results

in table 4. This makes little difference to the results, but seemed the sensible way to deal with trade
flows given that (i) the 23-country group omits the major oil producers and (ii) the 23-country ç

of it is intermediates trade.16 This conclusion is consistent with the aggregate numbers. For the

goods account for 7% of trade. None of this is intermediate inputs. Machinery and industrial goods account for 42%

that no finished automotive goods are intermediate inputs (e.g., treating trucks as final goods), only 12% of automotive
trade is intermediate inputs. ‘Other’ goods account for 23% of trade. ‘Other’ goods is dominated by forestry products
which in turn is primarily used as intermediates in the construction industry. We conservatively assume that only half
or 11% of ‘Other’ goods trade is intermediate inputs. The sum of 42% plus 12% plus 11% is 65%. That is, at least
two-thirds of Canada-U.S. trade is intermediates trade.

G
the t always lie in the tight interval Z 3 $F  3 j+* \ . As a result, we set tX/ equal to 0.9 for all the
G
estimates reported in the paper. (Setting tX/ to 0.80 or 1.00 makes no difference.) The t for the ML

specifications in tables 2 and 4 appear in table A.3. All of them are close to 0.90. The t underlying

the table 3 estimates vary between 0.85 and 0.93 across the 34 industries.
For NLS and NL2SLS, one typically replaces t with a consistent estimate. We chose tX

Allowing the variance to vary additionally across factors and years or introducing factor fixed
effects makes no difference to the estimates. For one, the effect of scaling by

Notes: The Herfindahl index is a 1992 index of the cross-country dispersion in the location of output. Smaller
values mean less regional concentration. Capital intensity is 1992 U.S. data on each industry’s capital-labour
ratio. Skill intensity is 1992 U.S. data on the ratio of skilled workers (completed high school) to unskilled
workers (did not complete high school). The capital- and skill-intensity columns are scaled so that electricity
is unity. Average rank is the average of the ranks of capital intensity and skill intensity.

t is the t-statistic for the hypothesis of constant returns to scale ( = 1).
b. Each estimate uses all 71 countries and all 11 factors. The 11 factors are capital, 4 types of labour (no education, primary education, secondary education, and post-secondary education), 3 types of land (cropland, pasture, and forest), and 3 types of energy (coal
reserves, oil and gas reserves, and hydroelectric potential). The number of years used varies across specifications. We use every
fifth year of data over the period indicated in the ‘Years’ column. The number of observations is
.
c. The NL2SLS columns report the instrumental variables results. The
instrument set uses lags of order given
by the ‘Lag Length’ column. The instrument set also includes polynomials of the
where the polynomial order is given
by the ‘K’ column. The more complicated
instrument set consists of fitted values of the

Notes: a. This table reports the ML scale estimates
. There are 71 countries in the sample, 23 of which are
OECD members. The 11 factors are listed in the note to table 2. The 7 factors aggregate the 3 land factors and
aggregate the 3 energy factors. All 5 years of data are used.
b. The ‘Baseline’ initial rank columns initiate the estimation algorithm with a ranking based on industries’ capital
and skill intensities. The ‘Alternative’ initial rank column initiates the algorithm with a ranking based on scale
elasticities from Paul and Siegel (1999).
c. A indicates significance at the 1% level (
). and
indicate
and
, respectively.
d. For the IRS groups, the data are from the 10th iteration. For the Non-Robust group, the data are averages of
the 9th and 10th iterations. No t-statistics are reported for the Non-Robust group.
e. For the Non-Robust group an empty cell denotes constant returns (insignificant
) in both iterations. A
denotes increasing returns (significant
) in both iterations.
