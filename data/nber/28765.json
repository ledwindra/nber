    "abstract": "\n\nInspired by the \ufb01eld experiment in Bertrand and Morse (2011), the state of Texas adopted an information disclosure for consumers taking out payday loans starting in January, 2012. The disclosure compares the cost of payday loans with other credit products, and presents their likelihood of renewal in easy-to-understand terms. Simultaneously, Austin and Dallas implemented stricter supply restrictions through city ordinances. We analyze both types of regulations, and \ufb01nd that the statewide disclosures led to a signi\ufb01cant and persistent 13% decline in loan volume in the \ufb01rst six months after implementation. The city ordinances led to a 61% decline in loan volume in Austin and a 44% decline in Dallas, with the timing of the e\ufb00ect driven by the start of enforcement rather than the e\ufb00ective date of regulation. The results show that both behaviorally-motivated disclosures and city-level supply restrictions can have a signi\ufb01cant impact on equilibrium loan quantities, with no e\ufb00ect on prices or evidence of evasive income falsi\ufb01cation.\n\n",
