    "abstract": "\n\nWe present a simple model in which rational but uninformed traders occasionally chase noise as if it were information, thereby amplifying sentiment shocks and moving prices away from fundamental values. We fill a theoretical gap in the literature by showing conditions under which noise traders can have an impact on market equilibrium disproportionate to their size in the market. The model offers a partial explanation for the surprisingly low market price of financial risk in the Spring of 2007.\n\n",
