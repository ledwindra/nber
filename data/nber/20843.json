    "abstract": "\n\nI study the long-term consequences of what amounted to an effective free school choice program which two decades ago targeted disadvantaged students in Israel. I show that the program led to significant gains in post-secondary education, through increased enrollment in academic and teachers' colleges but without any increase in enrollment in research universities. Free school choice increased also earnings at adulthood of treated students. Male students had much larger improvements in college schooling and labor market outcomes. Female students, however, experienced higher increases in marriage and fertility rates, which most likely interfered with their schooling and labor market outcomes.\n\n",
