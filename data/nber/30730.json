    "abstract": "\n\nWe critically review the emerging literature in Organizational and Personnel Economics concerning the role of managers and management practices. Our focus is on the middle managers who populate the hierarchies between top executives and front-line employees. We are especially concerned with research that brings together theoretical modeling and empirical investigation.\n\n",
