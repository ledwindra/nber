Government Investment and Fiscal Stimulus in the Short and Long Runs

NBER Working Paper No. 15153
July 2009
JEL No. E6,E62,H54
ABSTRACT
This paper contributes to the debate about fiscal multipliers by studying the impacts of government
investment in conventional neoclassical growth models. The analysis focuses on two dimensions of
fiscal policy that are critical for understanding the effects of government investment: implementation
delays associated with building public capital projects and expected future fiscal adjustments to debt-financed
spending. Implementation delays can produce small or even negative labor and output responses in
the short run; anticipated fiscal financing adjustments matter both quantitatively and qualitatively for
long-run growth effects. Taken together, these two dimensions have important implications for the
short-run and long-run impacts of fiscal stimulus in the form of higher government infrastructure investment.
The analysis is conducted in several models with features relevant for studying government spending,
including utility-yielding government consumption, time-to-build for private investment, and government
production.

GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE
SHORT AND LONG RUNS
ERIC M. LEEPER, TODD B. WALKER, AND SHU-CHUN S. YANG

1. Introduction
The recession that began in December 2007 will be the longest and the deepest economic
downturn since the Great Depression. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that
the economic contraction will last through most of 2009, with only a slow recovery beginning in 2010 [Congressional Budget Office (2009b)]. To prevent further deterioration and
facilitate the recovery, the U.S. Congress passed the $787 billion American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act, in addition to the $125 billion provided by the Economic Stimulus Act
of 2008. This unprecedentedly large scale of discretionary countercyclical fiscal actions has
certainly stimulated interest in and debate about the effects of fiscal policy.1
In addition to its large scale, this fiscal stimulus differs from those in the recent past by
relying more on spending increases and less on tax cuts. Nearly two-thirds of the stimulus
package is direct government spending and transfers. That spending includes $44 billion
for infrastructure expenditures on water quality, transportation, and housing, and another
$88 billion in direct federal spending on energy, innovative technology, and federal buildings.
[Congressional Budget Office (2009a)]. These infrastructure provisions, which are unusual
for countercyclical fiscal packages in the past 30 years, have revived the role of government
investment as a countercyclical tool.
This paper contributes to the policy debate by conducting a positive analysis of government investment in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. We focus on
two dimensions that are critical to evaluate the effects of government investment: the timing
of spending outlays and the methods of future fiscal financing. With respect to the former,

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in unusually large. Alone it provides an estimated
$719 billion stimulus for fiscal years 2009 to 2011 [Congressional Budget Office (2009a)], roughly equivalent
to 5 percent of GDP in 2008. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, partially
motivated by the 2001 recession, provided $202 billion stimulus for fiscal years 2001 to 2003 [Joint Committee
on Taxation (2001)], roughly equivalent to 2 percent of GDP in 2001. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of
1981 provided tax relief of about $130 billion for fiscal years 1981 to 1983 [estimated by the Joint Committee
on Taxation as documented in Congressional Quarterly Press (2006)], roughly equivalent to 4 percent of
GDP in 1981. (At the same time, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 cut government spending
by $35.2 billion [Congressional Quarterly Press (2006)].) Another large countercyclical fiscal action in the
post-war era was the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, which provided a tax reduction of $21 billion and additional
spending of $2 billion [Congressional Quarterly Press (2006)]; the total was 1.4 percent of GDP in 1975.

government investment is typically subject to several delays. In addition to the delay in recognizing a need to act, government investment, especially infrastructure projects, is subject
to substantial implementation delays. Projects often require coordination among federal,
state, and local governments and they are subjected to a long process of planning, bidding,
contracting, construction, and evaluation. These delays can make the economic benefits
from government investment difficult to synchronize with the business cycle.
With respect to fiscal financing, how deficit spending will be financed has important implications for the effects of government investment at longer horizons. This issue is particularly
important for the current fiscal situation. A quickly deteriorating federal government budget
situation, coupled with projections of exploding government debt due to rising health care
costs and American demographic shifts [Congressional Budget Office (2007)], suggest that
future policies must be expected to adjust to maintain budget solvency.2 Distortions from
higher expected income tax rates or lower expected government spending can undermine the
policy objective of promoting growth through productive government investment.
We examine these two issues in DSGE models calibrated to U.S. data. The delays between
authorization of a government spending plan and completion of an investment project are
modeled by a time-to-build technology for public capital projects, as in Kydland and Prescott
(1982), and investigate the implications of various periods of time-to-build. The estimates
of outlay streams associated with an enacted spending bill provide a schedule by which the
spending would likely occur. Delays in implementing government investment imply that
consumers and firms learn about spending plans before they are carried out. When private
agents act on the expectation of higher infrastructure spending, the economy can be affected
even before the public capital projects are completed.3
So long as public capital is productive, the expectation of higher infrastructure spending
generates a positive wealth effect, which discourages work and encourages consumption.
Because private investment projects typically do not entail the substantial delays associated
with public projects, it takes less time to build private capital. Private investment and
employment, therefore, may be delayed until the public capital is on line and raises the
productivity of private inputs. Compared with the situation without implementation delays,
in the short run private investment is lower and labor impacts may be small or even negative.
Output can fall in the short run in response to an increase in government investment. This
result is analogous to the phased-in tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003, where expectations of
future tax cuts may have induced workers and firms to delay work and production, retarding
the recovery from the 2001 recession [House and Shapiro (2006)].
To examine the second issue—the consequences of alternative methods of financing the
government spending—we consider adjustments in various fiscal instruments to stabilize the
government debt-to-output ratio, including reductions in transfers or government consumption, or increases in capital or labor income taxes. Accounting for future fiscal adjustments
is essential to evaluate the impact of government investment over longer horizons. Under
2

The ratio of federal debt held by the public to GDP rose from 0.33 in 2001 to 0.38 in 2008 [table B78
of Economic Report of the President (2009)]. In baseline projections by the Congressional Budget Office
(2009b), this ratio increases to 0.56 in 2019.
3
This phenomenon is the public investment analog to tax foresight studied by Yang (2005) and Leeper,
Walker, and Yang (2008, 2009) and war spending foresight examined by Ramey (2008).

lump-sum financing, if public capital raises productivity of private production inputs, productive government investment promotes economic growth. This result, however, overlooks
the possible contractionary effects introduced by distorting fiscal adjustments to stabilize
government debt. We find that if public capital is not sufficiently productive, then government investment can be contractionary in the long run as the disincentive to invest and work
due to expected fiscal adjustments can dominate the higher productivity of private inputs
from expansion of public capital.4 In addition, we find that the speed of fiscal adjustment
is a significant factor in determining the ability of government spending to offset cyclical
movements in macro aggregates. The impact of a deficit-financed increase in government
spending will be severely mitigated if the deficit is retired quickly through distortionary fiscal
instruments.
Our aim is to employ widely used models to analyze these two factors in order to better
connect our findings to existing literature. Although widely used, the models cannot adequately capture many of the aspects of the U.S. economy that are important for making
predictions about the consequences of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or other
policy actions designed to lift the economy out of the 2007-2009 recession. Because the Act
includes substantial authorizations for infrastructure spending, this analysis can nevertheless
highlight factors associated with expansions in government investment that are important
for understanding the impacts of government investment in the short run and the long run.

2. The Model
We analyze the effects of government investment and fiscal financing using several variants
of the neoclassical growth model described in this section. The model incorporates real
rigidities often seen in the class of DSGE policy models estimated with data, including habit
formation in consumption, investment adjustment costs, and variable utilization rates for
private capital [Smets and Wouters (2003, 2007), Bouakez and Rebei (2007), and Leeper,
Plante, and Traum (2009)]. Across the models used here, government investment takes the
form of productive public capital and is subject to a substantial time-to-build lag. Also,
increases in government investment are debt-financed and, therefore, engender future fiscal
adjustments that stabilize the debt-output ratio.

2.1. The Private Sector. The model economy consists of a representative agent, a representative firm, and a government. The agent derives utility from consumption (Ct ) and
leisure (1 − Lt ). The utility function takes the form

Barro (1990), Lau (1995), and Glomm and Ravikumar (1999) examine government spending impacts
when distorting taxes are used to finance it, whereas Finn (1993), Ambler and Paquet (1996) assume lumpsum taxes do the financing. Kamps (2004) considers both distorting and non-distorting financing.

and leisure (e > 0 and θ ≥ 0), and χ is the utility weight on leisure. Utility depends on

and the law of motion for private capital

Kt = (1 − δ) Kt−1 + Ω (It , It−1) .

(4)

Bt is government debt issued at t, which pays RtBt units of goods at t + 1. We introduce a
capital utilization rate, ut , as in Smets and Wouters (2003) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans (2005). The steady state capital utilization rate is assumed to be u = 1 and ψ(1) = 0.
Increases from the steady state utilization rate incurs a cost, ψ(ut)Kt−1 , where ψ(ut) is an
increasing, convex function.6 utKt−1 represents the effective units of private capital. The
rental rate for one effective unit of private capital is rt and the wage rate is wt. τtK and
τtL are proportional tax rates levied on capital and labor income. Tt is lump-sum transfers.
Following Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Fisher (2004), we assume

an adjustment cost. Net investment is given by Ω (It, It−1 ) ≡ 1 − Γ It−1
Γ (1) = Γ0 (1) = 0 and Γ00 (1) ≡ γ > 0. It is interpreted as private gross investment. In
steady state, It = It−1 and Γ(1) = 0, so gross investment equals net investment. δ is the
depreciation rate of private capital.
We adopt the standard assumption that time-to-build for private capital is one quarter;
that is, It adds to the capital stock Kt , which is productive at time t + 1. The sensitivity
analysis in section 4 relaxes this assumption and allows for longer time-to-build constraints
on private capital.

where Kt−1
is public capital in place at the end of t − 1, ut Kt−1 is the effective capital stock,

5The

literature has yet to form a consensus about the most appropriate way to model habit formation.
Some assume internal habits [McCallum and Nelson (1999) , Amato and Laubach (2004), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), and Kano and Nason (2008)], while others model habits as external [Abel (1990),
Smets and Wouters (2003), Ravn, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2006)]. However, Dennis (2008) shows that to
first-order approximation, the difference between internal and external habits is inconsequential for matching
business cycle data.
6A more natural way to model the cost of increasing capital utilization is to make the depreciation rate
depend on the utilization rate [Burnside and Eichenbaum (1996)]. The method we employs helps to identify
the capital utilization parameter in estimation [Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2007)].

2.2.1. Modeling the spending process. We model implementation delays in government investment with a time-to-build specification for public capital. We assume public capital
does not become productive for several quarters and that government investment in public
capital occurs gradually over time.
Table 1 motivates the time-to-build specification. The table reports the Congressional
Budget Office’s cost estimates and outlays for two pieces of legislation that involved government investment: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and
the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act (NHBRIA) of 2008.7 The
Congressional Budget Office’s cost estimates for the ARRA allow for substantial implementation delays in government investment and show that the outlays flow over several years
following the authorization. Congress authorized $27.5 billion for highway construction in
2009, yet the estimated outlays are only $2.75 billion for 2009, with a majority of the outlays
occurring over the next six years.8 Nearly half of the estimated outlays occur after fiscal year
2011.9 Another recent example is the NHBRIA, which would have authorized appropriations
of about $1 billion in fiscal year 2009 for repairing, rehabilitating, and replacing bridges on
public roadways. Outlays associated with this legislation would have extended more than
four years into the future, as table 1 shows. The estimated first-year outlays account for only
27 percent of the total budget authority, while the cumulative outlays at the end of second
year are only about 67 percent.
We model the delay between when government investment is authorized and when it comes
on line as public capital by letting the budget authorized for government investment at time
t be AIt and the number of quarters to complete an investment project be N. The law of
motion for public capital is then
G
KtG = (1 − δG ) Kt−1
+ AIt−N +1.

The NHBRIA bill was not enacted.
bill includes many transportation projects. The implementation period of eight years does not
imply that all projects take eight years to complete, as some projects do not start until later years.
9As of May 22, 2009 (three months after the enactment), outlays as a percent of budget authority were
less than 1 percent of budget authority on transportation in the ARRA [Elmendorf (2009)].

At time t agents observe the current and past realizations of the innovations to government investment policy {εt−j }∞
j=0 , and know the timing pattern of building public capital.
This assumes that information about spending legislation and its estimated outlay paths is
publicly available, being widely reported in the press, so that people foresee when a public
capital project will be completed.10
2.2.2. Debt Financing. Increases in government investment that are initially debt-financed
must eventually bring forth adjustments to fiscal policy that ensure solvency. To ensure
that a first-order approximation remains valid, the adjustments to transfers, government
consumption, or one of the income tax rates are sufficient to return the debt-output ratio to
its steady state value. In log-linearized forms, the fiscal rules are

10It is straightforward to show that this information structure leads to the empirical difficulties described
in Ramey (2008) and Leeper, Walker, and Yang (2008, 2009).

In the main model, fiscal adjustments are not triggered until eight quarters after the initial
increase in government debt. Since the federal government is not subject to year-to-year
balanced budget rules, delayed financing is more relevant empirically.12
2.3. Calibration. The model is calibrated at a quarterly frequency. Most parameters are
set to values that are typical in real business cycle studies of fiscal policy. Table 2 summarizes
the parameter values under the benchmark calibration. In steady state the consumptionoutput ratio is 0.64, the private investment-output ratio is 0.16, and the share of time devoted
to work is 0.2. We justify the settings of some of the non-standard parameters below.
2.3.1. Public and private capital. We calibrate the ratio of public to private capital at
K G /K = 0.32 in the steady state, which equals the historical U.S. average from 1947-2007
(table 1.1 of Fixed Assets Accounts, BEA). Government investment as a share of output is
sGI = 0.04, which equals the historical average from 1947 to 2007 (NIPA Table 3.9.5). Given
sGI and the ratio of public to private capital, the implied depreciation rate for public capital
is δG = 0.02, which is comparable to the literature [Baxter and King (1993) and Kamps
(2004) set δ = δG = 0.025].13
To calibrate the production function, (5), we follow Baxter and King (1993) and Glomm
and Ravikumar (1997) and assume constant returns to scale with respect to private production factors: αK + αL = 1.
There are diverse views in the litaerature about the productivity of public capital (αG ).
Early work estimates log-linear production functions and tends to find a relatively large αG .
Aschauer (1989b) obtains the elasticity of output to nonmilitary public capital to be 0.39,
and Aschauer (1989a) finds that the elasticity for core infrastructure (transportation, utility,
and water) is 0.24.14 Results from subsequent studies using alternative methodologies are
11Leeper

and Yang (2008) adopt similar rules, but assume that the fiscal adjustment is triggered onequarter after the rising debt-output ratio. We examine this alternative in section 4.
12Under current PAYGO rules, new mandatory spending or tax policy changes should not add to the
deficit; hence fiscal adjustments should occur within a specified budget window. In recent years, however,
PAYGO rules have been waived several times.
13Based on the data from the current-cost depreciation in the Fixed Assets Accounts (table 1.3), the
average annual depreciation rate for government capital is about 0.04. However, using this depreciation rate
will imply too little government investment in the steady state. The data also imply a smaller depreciation
rate for public capital than for the private capital. Note that capital in our model implicitly includes durable
goods, which have higher depreciation rates.
14The production function approach has been challenged on several econometric grounds, in particular,
for missing values and causality problems. See Munnell (1992) and Gramlich (1994) for a survey and the
criticisms. Recent work by Kamps (2004) estimates VARs for 22 OECD countries and finds evidence that
GDP Granger causes public capital, suggesting reverse causation as assumed when estimating a log-linear
production function.

inconclusive about the productivity of public capital. Holtz-Eakin (1994), using state-level
data, finds that public-sector capital has no effect on private sector productivity. Evans
and Karras (1994), using panel data for 48 states from 1970 to 1986, find that government
capital often has statistically significant negative productivity. Kamps (2004) estimates
structural VARs to find that an exogenous increase in public capital has no significant effects
on output for the U.S. In contrast to these negative results, Nadiri and Mamuneas (1994)
obtain significant productive effects from infrastructure and R&D capital in terms of the
cost structure and productivity performance of 12 two-digit U.S. manufacturing industries.
Pereira and de Frutos (1999) estimate the elasticity of private output with respect to public
capital to be between 0.34 and 0.39 for U.S. data from 1956 to 1989.
Given the wide range of estimates for αG , we explore αG = 0.05 (the benchmark value
used in Baxter and King (1993)) and αG = 0.1. Under our benchmark calibration, with
αK = 0.36 and K G /K = 0.32, αG > 0.12 implies that the marginal product of public capital
is greater than the marginal product of private capital in the steady state. We set the upper
bound for αG to be 0.1.
2.3.2. Fiscal variables. The government consumption share of output in the steady state is
set to its historical average, sGC = 0.16 (1947-2007, NIPA table 3.9.5). Steady-state tax
rates on capital and labor income are set to the average tax rates from 1947 to 2007 as
constructed by Jones’s (2002) method. We select the transfer-output ratio sT = 0.058 so
that the debt-output ratio is sB = 1.66 in the steady state.15
To calibrate implementation delays, we refer to a Congressional Budget Office (2008,
p. 19) report that states: “. . . for major infrastructure projects supported by the federal
government, such as a highway construction and activities of the Army Corps of Engineers,
initial outlays usually total less than 25 percent of the funding provided in a given year. For
large projects, the initial rate of spending can be significantly lower than 25 percent.” We
assume the maximum period to complete a government investment project is three years, so
N = 12 in equation (11). The spending rates in table 2, the φ’s, are for N = 12. During the
initial quarter when a bill is enacted, we assume zero outlay because of the administrative and
planning process involved in an investment project. With three-year time-to-build, at the end
of first year 25 percent of the authorized budget is spent (φ0 = 0 and φ1 = φ2 = φ3 = 0.083);
by the end of the second year, two thirds of the authorized budget is spent; the rest is spent
during the third year. The analysis also explores two other spending patterns, which take
one year to complete (N = 4, φ0 = 0, and φ1 = . . . = φ4 = 1/3) and one-quarter to complete
(N = 1 and φ0 = 1).
Our study of the effects of fiscal adjustment methods, allows only one fiscal instrument to
adjust at a time. The choices of steady-state fiscal adjustment parameters, q’s in table 2, yield
a pattern of debt responses to a government investment shock that roughly follows the paths
estimated from U.S. data. Under the benchmark calibration, the half life of the debt-output
ratio is about 81 to 83 quarters in response to a 1 percent government investment shock,
15The average ratio of federal debt held by the private sector to annual GDP is 0.42 from 1947 to 2007
[table B79, Economic Report of the President (2009)]. This implies that the ratio of debt to quarterly GDP
is 1.68.

and the peak increase in the debt-output ratio ranges from 0.17 to 0.19.16 Friedman (2005)
finds that the half life of the debt-output ratio responses to its own shock in a univariate
autoregressive representation is 85 quarters for the postwar U.S. data.
To compute multipliers, we allow for all fiscal instruments to adjust, with the weights
assigned to each instrument based on empirical estimates. Leeper, Plante, and Traum (2009)
use Bayesian methods to estimate federal fiscal multipliers in U.S. data from 1960-2008.
They find that data prefer a model that allows all financing methods—government spending,
transfer, and capital and labor income taxes—to respond to debt. The estimates suggest
that historically the government has relied more on adjusting transfers and capital income
taxes to stabilize debt and less on government spending and labor income taxes. The weights
are 0.44, 0.33, 0.19, and 0.04 for transfers, capital taxes, government consumption, and labor
taxes, respectively.17
2.3.3. Friction parameters. Finally, we calibrate parameters governing habit formation, investment adjustment costs, and the capital utilization rate adopting values estimated in
DSGE models. Bouakez and Rebei (2007) estimate a model with a similar functional form
for the habit stock, obtaining the degree of habit formation b = 0.25. The cost parameter for
investment adjustments is set to γ = 2, consistent with Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
00 (1)
(2005). The cost parameter for increasing capital utilization rate is set to ψψ0 (1)
= 0.18, as
estimated by Smets and Wouters (2003). A higher value of

ψ00 (1)
ψ0 (1)

indicates higher costs from
00

(1)
increasing the utilization rate above its steady state value. When b = 0, γ = 0 and ψψ0 (1)
is set to a high value (like 2), the model’s performance when lump-sum transfers adjust to
stabilize debt approaches that of simple neoclassical growth models, as in Baxter and King
(1993) and Kamps (2004).
16We

define half life as the time it takes for the peak response of debt to a government spending shock to
decay by 50 percent.
17Fiscal rules estimated in Leeper, Plante, and Traum (2009) are slightly different from those used here.
They assume that government responds to deviations in the level of debt, not the debt-output ratio and the
response lag is only one quarter.

3. Impacts of Government Investment
Proponents of increasing government investment often argue that productive government
investment can boost employment in the short run and promote economic growth in the long
run.18 That outcome is supported by a conventional neoclassical growth model with productive public capital, which predicts that an unexpected increase in government investment
can generate higher employment and output at both short and longer horizons [Baxter and
King (1993)]. These positive results, however, hinge on structures that do not account for
implementation delays and distorting offsetting policies.
We begin with a simplified version of the main model, where the setup is the same as
in section 2, except that only lump-sum taxes (or reductions in lump-sum transfers) are
used to balance the budget each period. We first show that with no implementation delays
and lump-sum financing, our model produces the same qualitative responses to a government investment shock for key macroeconomic variables as those obtained from conventional
neoclassical growth models. Because implementation delays affect short-run dynamics in a
similar manner across various financing methods, we then continue to use the simplified
model to illustrate the impact of implementation delays. Finally, we show that distorting
fiscal adjustments are important for both long and short-term effects under the four financing
mechanisms described in section 2.
3.1. Effects with No Implementation Delays and Lump-Sum Financing. Neoclassical growth models capture three important channels that determine the impact of government investment: the crowding-out effect, wealth effects (both negative and positive), and
the effect from changing the marginal productivity of private inputs. Ceteris paribus, higher
government investment reallocates existing resources so there are fewer goods available for
the private sector to consume and save. This crowding-out effect is induced by more competition for goods from higher government demand. As goods today become more valuable, the
real interest rate rises to clear the goods market. Higher government investment financed by
lump-sum taxes generates a negative wealth effect, encouraging agents to work harder and
save more by reducing consumption.19 When government investment is productive, however,
there is another wealth effect in the opposite direction: a higher stock of productive public
capital acts like a total factor productivity increase to create the expectation that more
goods will be available in the future. This discourages current saving. Finally, the last effect
occurs at longer horizons as public capital gradually builds up, which increases the marginal
product of capital and labor. This provides incentives to work and save due to higher wages
and returns to capital.
Figure 1 shows the impacts of an increase in government investment under three different
assumptions about the productivity of public capital: dotted lines assume αG = 0.1, solid
18Aschauer’s

(1989b) work provides empirical links between productive public capital and private productivity. Aschauer (1990) emphasizes the growth effect of government investment, arguing that non-military
investment spending is expansionary. Recent policy discussions focus on the ability of government investment
to create jobs in the short run [Federal Highway Administration (2002) and Romer and Bernstein (2009)].
19
The literature studying the effects of unproductive government spending often combines the crowdingout effect with the negative wealth effect, because both reduce consumption and increase labor. But the two
effects have different implications for private investment. The crowding out effect lowers investment, but the
negative wealth effect creates an incentive to increase investment (saving).

lines assume αG = 0.05, and dotted-dashed lines assume αG = 0. The first column reports
responses to a permanent shock of government investment (ρI = 1), and the second column
reports responses to a transitory shock (ρI = 0.9). Other parameters are set to those in
table 2.
As shown by the first column in the figure, a permanent increase in unproductive government investment (dotted-dashed lines), produces a dominant negative wealth effect. Agents
reduce consumption, increase saving (investment), and work more. Consequently, government spending stimulates output but lowers both consumption and leisure.20 However, if
government investment is productive, private investment can drop substantially in the short
run due to the positive wealth effect from the higher expected future productivity created
by the increase in the stock of public capital. With productive government investment, consumption is permanently higher while labor is also higher because more public capital raises
20
This is often referred to as the “neoclassical view” of government spending, as examined by Barro
(1989). Gali, Lopez-Salido, and Valles (2007) and Monacelli and Perotti (2008) argue that the crowding out
of private consumption is inconsistent with vector autoregressive evidence and propose creative modeling
techniques to reconcile theory with the VAR evidence.

GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUNS

the marginal product of labor. Comparing responses under αG = 0.1 and 0.05, we find that
the more productive is government investment, the stronger is the positive wealth effect,
which generates greater initial declines in private investment and smaller increases in labor.
For investment, employment, and output the short-run impacts can differ markedly from the
long-run effects.
A transitory (ρI = 0.9) government spending shock elicits somewhat different responses,
as shown in the second column of figure 1. While output remains positive, unlike permanent
government investment increases, private investment falls initially, regardless of the value
of αG . Investment adjustment costs generate a hump-shaped decline in investment because
adjustment costs punish rapid changes. When a government investment shock is transitory,
the two opposite wealth effects from higher future lump-sum taxes and higher future income
become weaker. In the short run, the crowding-out effect dominates, lowering both consumption and saving. As the productive public capital stock gradually accumulates, private
investment eventually rises in response to the resulting increase in the productivity of private
capital.
It may seem surprising that enhanced productiveness of public capital generates larger
initial declines in private investment. Private investment falls by 0.15 units when αG = 0.1,
by 0.15 units when αG = 0.05, and by 0.10 units when αG = 0. This difference arises because
the larger αG produces a stronger positive wealth effect, which raises the consumption profile
at the expense of saving. The peak initial decline in consumption is the smallest when
αG = 0.1.
This model predicts immediate and sustained increases in labor and output whether government spending is productive or unproductive. The channels through which labor and
output increase, however, are quite different: with unproductive government spending the
main channel is a negative wealth effect, while for productive government investment the
primary channel is the resulting increase in the productivity of private inputs. In either case,
the results provide some support for the use of government spending or government investment to expand employment and output. Now we turn to how these results change when
government investment is subject to implementation delays and distorting fiscal financing.
3.2. Implementation Delays: Time-to-Build Public Capital. Because permanent increases in government investment are rare, we shift the focus to transitory increases. Implementation delays mainly affect short-run responses. To illustrate the impacts of implementation delays, we assume public capital is subject to a time-to-build lag. We continue to
assume lump-sum financing.
Figure 2 plots responses to an exogenous government investment shock for αG = 0.1 (first
column) and αG = 0.05 (second column). The figure reports results for three different lengths
between when the budget for an investment project is authorized and when the project is
completed: one quarter (N = 1, dashed lines); one year (N = 4, dotted-dashed lines); three
years (N = 12, solid lines). Implementation periods up to a year apply to maintenance
projects for existing infrastructure or new smaller projects, while a three-year delay applies
to large infrastructure projects, such as a dam or a new interstate highway. To facilitate
comparison, we repeat the responses with no implementation delays (N = 1, as seen in
the previous section). In addition, we scale the responses so that the area under the three

curves of government investment equals one unit of good [bottom two panels of the figure].
All consumption, investment, and output responses are in terms of goods units and are
interpretable as multipliers. Labor is in percent deviation from the steady state level.
Implementation delays alter the short-run dynamics substantially, especially for consumption, labor, and output. As shown earlier, under the usual assumption of no delays (dashed
lines), consumption and private investment fall but output and labor rise immediately. Private investment does not rise until more than three years after the shock.
When there are implementation delays, private investment does not rise until much later:
after four years with one-year delay and almost six years with three-year delay. The peak
decline is also larger than in the case without delays. Implementation delays imply a slower

GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUNS

14

build-up of public capital, and, therefore, a slower increase in the marginal product of private
inputs. Because it takes less time to build private capital, agents postpone investment until
the public capital stock is usable.
While investment responses differ only quantitatively when there are implementation delays, consumption, labor, and output differ qualitatively in their short-run dynamics. As in
the earlier model, the driving force for an immediate increase in labor without delay is the
crowding-out effect or negative wealth effect. Under implementation delays, the government
absorbs fewer goods initially and the crowding out effect is smaller in the short run. On the
other hand, since the total increase in government investment is the same across the three
delay periods, the positive wealth effect from higher future public capital operates in each
case. Less crowding out each period, coupled with the same positive wealth effect, generates
a slight decline in employment and a slight increase in consumption in the short run, in
contrast to the case without delays.
With implementation delays, labor also declines in the short run because the marginal
product of labor rises only gradually as public capital gets installed. With longer implementation delays, the rebound in investment and labor is also slower. Consequently, with
a three-year delay, output does not begin to rise until three years after the shock; with a
one-year delay, output does not rise until two quarters after the shock.
When αG = 0.05 (second column of figure 2), the qualitative patterns of all variables follow
closely to those with αG = 0.1 . Under αG = 0.05, the initial decline in labor and output
under delayed implementation is, however, negligible. As public capital is less productive,
the positive wealth effect induced from more productive public capital is also smaller. When
αG = 0.05 and N = 4 or N = 12, this positive wealth effect is almost canceled out entirely
by the crowding-out effect, leaving little impact on consumption, labor, and output for the
initial two to three quarters. Since public capital is less productive, the subsequent increase
of private investment and labor is also smaller because the productivity of private inputs
rises less.
The above analysis shows that an implementation delay is qualitatively and quantitatively
important for short-run dynamics. In contrast to the results when there is no implementation
delay—that an increase in government investment is expansionary and raises employment
immediately—we find that implementation delays imply that productive government investment can have little effect or even a negative effect on labor and output in the short run.
This period can be as brief as a couple of quarters or as long as three years. In addition,
the short-run decline in private investment can be larger and longer compared to the case
without implementation delays. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating
implementation delays in when assessing the short-term effects of government investment.
3.3. Fiscal Adjustments. Another important consideration to determine the effects of
government investment, particularly in the long run, are the sources of fiscal financing. Up
to this point, we exploited the Ricardian equivalence of the model when government spending is financed by non-distorting taxes. Of course, government typically finances stimulus
packages by selling government debt, most of which is ultimately financed by distorting fiscal
instruments. We examine four alternative schemes for financing and eventually retiring the
expansion in new debt: adjustments to future lump-sum transfers, unproductive government

spending, capital taxes, and labor taxes. In addition, we examine the speed at which debt
is paid back. Because time-to-build assumptions have little influence on responses at the
longer-run horizon, we illustrate how fiscal adjustments matter for the government investment effects assuming three years to build for public capital.
3.3.1. Adjustment Method. Fiscal adjustment parameters are set to the values in table 2.

assume capital income taxes adjust, and dotted lines assume government consumption adjust.
The first column has responses under αG = 0.1, and the second one has responses under
αG = 0.05. As the figure makes evident, the choice of financing instrument matters a great
deal for the effects of infrastructure spedning in the long run.
Fiscal adjustments through distorting financing methods create another channel that influences the impacts of government investment. Raising income tax rates or reducing government consumption offsets some of the growth effects from higher productive public capital.
The net effect over longer horizons can be expansionary or contractionary. Among the four
methods of financing, government investment is most expansionary when non-distorting
transfers are reduced (solid lines), and it is least expansionary—in fact, contractionary—
when government raises the tax rate on capital income (dotted-dashed lines). As shown in
the path of private investment, raising the marginal tax rate on capital income generates
strong negative impacts on private investment. These negative effects can dominate the positive impacts from more productive public capital. Lower private investment also reduces the
marginal product of labor, driving down employment. Combining these two factors, output
falls below its initial level eight to nine years after the initial government investment shock
and stays persistently low before returning to the steady state.21
Increasing the tax rate on labor income to stabilize debt reduces the after-tax return
to labor, which drives down labor inputs and output relative to the case with transfer
reductions. A reduction in (unproductive) government consumption, lowers the amount of
resource government absorbs from the economy and offsets some of the crowding out effects
from the increase in government investment. As a result, labor falls more and consumption
rises relative to the case with transfer reductions. Lower labor, in turn, reduces some of the
growth effect from the productive government investment.22
As shown in the second column of figure 3, the less productive is government investment
(smaller αG ), the more likely government investment is to be contractionary in the longer
run. In the extreme case αG = 0 (not shown here), output turns significantly negative for
all three distorting financing methods and is expansionary only when transfers adjust.
3.3.2. Speed of adjustment. Just as the method to finance government investment can have
significant impacts on macro aggregates, so can the timing of the financing. Even productive
government investment can have anemic effects in the short run if the debt used to finance
the government expenditure is assumed to be retired quickly. Figure 4 plots responses to a
government investment shock assuming no implementation delays, that αG = 0.1, and that
capital taxes adjust to satisfy the budget constraint. We assume two alternative fiscal rules

Leeper and Yang (2008) show, deleterious effects of future fiscal adjustments become more pronounced the more persistent is the initial fiscal disturbance.

years. The second rule assumes capital taxes adjust quickly to retire debt, responding with
only a one-quarter delay. This rule delivers a half life of debt of 11 years (dashed line).
In general, when an offsetting policy is distorting, speeding up debt retirement enhances
the negative impact of fiscal adjustments from raising tax rates or reducing government
consumption. Under implementation delays, retiring debt more quickly can slightly amplify
the negative effects on labor and output in the short run. With no implementation delays,
the differences between a slow and a fast debt retirement can be more conspicuous. Figure
4 demonstrates that the timing of fiscal adjustments can generate both quantitative and
qualitative changes in a response to a government investment increase. Under the assumption that debt is retired quickly, consumption and private investment never rise following an
increase in government investment. This is because after only one quarter of debt buildup,
capital taxes respond aggressively to draw down debt. Higher capital taxes offset the positive wealth effect, reducing consumption, and they lower the after-tax return to capital,
significantly depressing investment at all horizons. With respect to the stimulative effects of
government investment, notice that output and labor turn negative after only one year under

the quick adjustment specification. This suggests that the stimulative effects of government
spending depend crucially on the timing of fiscal adjustments.

4. Sensitivity Analysis: Alternative Model Specifications
In this section we check the robustness of our conclusions along three dimensions. Our
analysis so far has assumed that government consumption is unproductive. Following the
literature in studying the relationship between government and private consumption, we
allow government consumption to be a complement or a substitute with private consumption.
Second, we have assumed time-to-build for government investment based on an institutional
argument, but not for private capital. Since the time-to-build assumption is initiated to
model the construction process for capital in general, we explore the case where private
capital is subject to one year to build. Finally, we model the government sector separately
from the private sector, requiring government to hire labor and use intermediate goods to
produce its output.
4.1. Utility from Government Consumption. Following Bouakez and Rebei (2007), the
et), which is assumed
agent derives utility from leisure (1 − Lt ) and effective consumption (C

(18)

When ϕ = 1, effective consumption collapses to Ct , and we are back to the model in section
2. v is the elasticity of substitution between private and government consumption: v = 0
indicates private and government consumptions are perfect complements; v → ∞ implies
that the two are perfect substitutes. Preferences take the form

We set the weight on private consumption to be ϕ = 0.8 as in Bouakez and Rebei (2007).
They estimate a DSGE model with the utility function in (19) using U.S. data, and find that
the elasticity of substitution between private and government consumption is v = 0.33. When
e = 2, as in our benchmark calibration, v < 1e , which implies Edgeworth complementarity
between private and government consumption.
Figure 5 plots impulse responses for v = 0.33 and αG = 0.1 under two financing methods:
solid lines assume transfers adjust and dotted lines assume government consumption adjusts.
The first column assumes three years to build for public capital, and the second column makes
the usual assumption of one quarter to build (or no implementation delays). Again, the total
increase in government investment under the four scenarios is one unit of goods. Comparing
the results from the main model (where government consumption generates no utility) with
those from the current model (where government consumption generates utility), we find
responses of four macro variables are very similar under adjustments in transfers and the

two income tax rates.23 For presentation clarity, we only plot results under transfers and
government consumption adjustments in figure 5.
When the fiscal adjustment reduces government consumption, private consumption rises
in most periods, in contrast to the case with unproductive government consumption. Output
also falls over longer horizons, as does employment for most periods.
23The two models differ in the value of ϕ and q C . We change the benchmark value of q C = −0.0035 to
q C = −0.006 in the current model in order to yield a valid solution. When an adjusting magnitude is too
small, the debt-to-output ratio cannot be stabilized, and the transversality condition for debt is violated.

When government and private consumption are complements, a decrease in government
consumption reduces the marginal utility derived from private consumption, reducing the
incentive to consume. In the previous case when ϕ = 1, a reduction in government consumption offsets the crowding-out effect from higher government investment, which drives
up private consumption. In the current case (ϕ = 0.8 and v = 0.33), private consumption
co-moves with government consumption. A decrease in private consumption demand makes
labor fall and output fall in the out years despite higher private investment.
Comparing the first column with the second column in figure 5, we find that implementation delays make the short-run expansionary effects of government investment on employment
and output as in the main model. Whether under transfers or government consumption adjustments, government investment makes employment and output rise immediately when
there are no implementation delays, but these two variables fall in the short run with a
three-year delay. In fact, when government consumption generates utility and it is adjusted
to stabilize debt, government investment is only expansionary for a relatively short period
(about six years with implementation delays and about ten years with no delays) throughout
the horizon.
Given the uncertainty about the relationship between private and government consumption in the literature, we also investigate the case where government and private consumption
are Edgeworth substitutes by setting v = 0.6.24 The responses for all variables under the
four methods of fiscal adjustments are very close to those in figure 3 and hence are not
shown here. If government consumption is a substitute for private consumption, reductions
in government consumption (to reduce deficits) make private consumption rise, reinforcing
the crowding-out effect in the case of unproductive government consumption.
Some authors justify treating government and private consumption as complements because it generates positive co-movement in government and private consumption [Bouakez
and Rebei (2007)], as in the VAR evidence [Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and Gali, LopezSalido, and Valles (2007)]. Although the literature has not settled on theoretical grounds
to explain why private consumption rises following a government spending increase, our
conclusion that government investment impacts depend on implementation delays and fiscal
adjustments holds up, whether government consumption is unproductive, or is a complement
or a substitute with private consumption.
4.2. Time-To-Build for Private Capital. Kydland and Prescott (1982) incorporate timeto-build for construction of all new productive capital to explain the autocovariances of real
output and the covariances of cyclical output with other macro variables. To this point,
we have assumed time-to-build for public capital but not for private capital. This raises a
concern that our results of little or negative output and labor responses to a government
investment shock initially may be due to the asymmetric treatment of time-to-build. In
this subsection, we extend our main model to allow one year to build for private capital as
assumed in Kydland and Prescott (1982) and McGrattan (1994).
24
A common specification assumes government and private consumption are additive in a utility function.
Estimations under this specification is also inconclusive about whether government consumption and private
consumption are Edgeworth substitutes or complements [Kormendi (1983), Aschauer (1985), Ahmed (1986),
Karras (1994), and Ni (1995)].

Figure 6. Impulse responses to higher government investment with time-tobuild for private capital. Solid lines: transfers adjust; dotted-dashed lines:
capital income taxes adjust. First column: three years to build public capital;
second column: no implementation delays.

Let St be in the investment project started at t, which takes four quarters to construct
and form private capital. The law of motion for private capital is
Kt = (1 − δ) Kt−1 + St .

(20)

At time t, the fraction of investment project St implemented is φS0 , and φS1 , φS2 , and φS3 are
the fractions implemented in dates t + 1, t + 2, and t + 3. At any given date, implemented

where Ω (It, It−1) is net investment excluding adjustment costs and the gross investment cost
is It. The rest of the model economy is the same as the setup in section 2.
To calibrate the time-to-build parameters, we turn to empirical estimates for these parameters. Kydland and Prescott (1982) assume all tangible capital has an average construction
period of one year with equal rates for each quarter, but empirical findings reject this assumption. McGrattan (1994) fits a DSGE model with U.S. data from 1947 to 1987 and estimates
φS0 = 0.475, φS1 = 0.0433, φS2 = 0.0683, and φS3 = 0.4134. These parameters are estimated
with high precision, but the M-shaped pattern is counterintuitive. Normally, we expect
decaying completing rates over time. Montgomery (1995) estimates the value-weighted average completion pattern for U.S. nonresidential structures (1961-1991) and finds a high initial
completion rate followed by a slow decaying pattern, with the average construction period
of 16.7 months. Figure 6 contains impulse responses with φSi ’s set to the values McGrattan
estimates. We also compute impulse responses using the alternative pattern φS0 = 0.45,
φS1 = 0.30, φS2 = 0.15, and φS3 = 0.1. The results are very close to figure 6, and are not
shown here. We investigate the case where αG = 0.1.
This model is identical to the main model when φS0 = 1 and φS1 = φS2 = φS3 = 0. The most
noticeable difference between the two first columns of figures 6 and 3 is investment responses.
When there is no time-to-build for private capital, investment falls much more in the short
run and rises before returning to steady state. With the assumption of one year to build for
private capital, the decline in the private investment in the short run is much smaller but
now investment never rises. In the earlier explanation, private investment rises in later years
mainly because of rising marginal product of capital due to more productive public capital.
While this incentive still exists with time-to-build for private capital, private investment now
represents the moving average of investment initiated each period. The decision to reduce
investment in the initial five to ten years is spread over a longer period of time so that the
later incentive to invest more is offset by earlier declines.
Overall, our earlier finding that the implementation delays in government investment can
prolong and deepen the negative private investment responses still holds under time-to-build
for private capital. In addition, we still find labor and output have tiny initial responses when
there are implementation delays in government investment, while they jump up on imapct
when there are no implementation delays. At longer horizons, as in figure 3, government
investment contracts output when capital taxes are raised to stabilize debt.25
4.3. A Two-Sector Model with Government Production. Unlike the models to this
point, actual governments employ workers and purchase intermediate goods and services to
produce government consumption and investment goods that perform various public services (national defense, public order and safety, transportation, education, etc.). Like firms,
government also rents labor from private agents. The macroeconomic literature generally
does not model government as a separate production sector. To examine more closely the
25Responses under adjustments by labor income taxes and government consumption are qualitatively the
same as (but slightly less expansionary than) those under transfers adjustment.

employment impacts of an increase in government investment, we change the model specification in section 2, so that government combines intermediate goods and labor to produce
government output similar to Cavallo (2005).26 We broadly define labor devoted to government production (LG
t ) to include jobs paid for with government resources. For example, if

26Cavallo

(2005) does not distinguish between government consumption and investment.

This means government increases the purchase of intermediate goods and services proportionally to the gross government output. The rest of the setup for preferences and government

To calibrate this economy, we assume that in steady state, LL = 0.2, which is identical

to the government consumption and investment share of total output ( G Y+G ). The value
of z in (29) is set to the ratio of the sum of intermediate goods and services purchased and
government investment to the sum of government consumption and investment for 2007 (line
6 of NIPA Table 3.10.5, and lines 1 and 3 of NIPA Table 3.9.5); this gives z = 0.55. The
transfer-output ratio is reset to 0.08 to yield sB = 1.59. Some fiscal adjustment parameters
are also modified to yield a valid solution: qK = 0.08 and qC = −0.05. This calibration
requires the total factor productivity for the government production to be AG = 0.98, close
to the value of AP = 1 for the private production.
Figure 7 plots the impulse responses to an cumulative one-unit good increase in government
investment under αG = 0.1 (first column) and αG = 0.05 (second column). Both columns
assume three years to build public capital. Again, we only plot responses under transfers
and capital income tax adjustments because responses under adjustments by labor income
taxes and government consumption are relatively close to those under transfers adjustments.
A model with government production explicitly captures the competition for goods and labor due to an increase in government spending. In a model without government production,
the increase in aggregate labor is due to the crowding-out effect or negative wealth effect.
The private sector feels poorer and reduces consumption. This drives up the value of work.
Labor supply increases, raising aggregate employment and reducing the wage rate.30 The
prediction that higher government spending lowers wages, however, is at variance with empirical evidence that finds the opposite [Rotemberg and Woodford (1992), Fatas and Mihov
(2001), and Gali, Lopez-Salido, and Valles (2007)].31 The addition of government production,
on the other hand, predicts a rising wage rate following an increase in government spending.
29Appendix

A contains the derivation of this constraint, and shows the accounting consistency for the
income and product sides in this model.
30Seitz (1994) investigates the impact of provision of public capital on demand for private inputs using
German data. He finds a negative relationship between public capital and demand for private labor.
31Studies using the narrative approach based on war dummies, however, find that an increase in war
spending leads to a lower wage rate [see Edelberg, Eichenbaum, and Fisher (1999) and Ramey and Shapiro
(1998)].

GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUNS

26

Government draws additional labor for its production when it increases government investment. The higher government demand for labor raises aggregate employment and the wage
rate, in contrast to models without government production.
In response to a rising wage rate, private labor falls (the fourth row in figure 7), lowering the
marginal product of private capital; output falls in the short run across all financing methods
whether there are implementation delays or not.32 While we do not present responses under
no implementation delays, the short-run dynamics are dominated by the negative impact on
private production from a rising wage rate. The initial fall in output is the smallest when
government investment is subject to longest time to build. Because the spending rate is
small each period when time-to-build is long, the labor drawn by government production is
also small and hence only a modest increase in the wage rate.
Compared to the earlier results without government production (figure 3, αG = 0.1),
private investment falls much more in the case of government production. In addition to the
crowding-out effect and wealth effect, when government draws labor to produce, the falling
marginal product of private capital due to smaller private labor inputs amplifies the original
reduction in private investment. With a larger decline in output, consumption also falls more
relative to the case without government production.
In later years, one noticeable difference from the model without government production
is the case under capital tax adjustments. Without government production, output falls
substantially in later years, but stays positive with government production under αG = 0.1
for a long period before returning to the steady state. Under the fiscal policy rules in
(12)-(15), when the debt-output ratio falls below the steady state, the capital tax rate
falls automatically to increase debt to its steady state level. In this model, as output falls
significantly initially, the debt-output ratio drops quickly. Under our calibration, the capital
tax rate over reacts and drives debt-output ratio below the steady state. Consequently,
the capital tax rate falls, which drives up output in the later period. The influence of the
productiveness of public capital can still be seen by comparing the output responses in the
first and second columns in figure 7: output rises much less in later years when public capital
is less productive.
In this model with government production, we explicitly model the channel by which
government spending directly “creates” jobs. The results show that more jobs generated
by government spending does not necessarily translate into higher output. In contrast, the
increased labor demand drives up the wage rate, which reinforces the contractionary effects
in the short run.
Some economists would argue that in a recession there are idle labor resources, so government production does not raise wages and crowd out private employment. Our model,
and most macro models, cannot address this point. Since government investment is likely
to be subject to substantial implementation delays, it is quite possible that some of the government investment will occur when the economy is already on its way to recovery. In that
32
Finn (1998) finds that to a positive government employment shock, output, consumption, private investment, and private labor fall, and average labor productivity rises. Our results from rising government
employment is consistent with her findings. In her model, government is not modeled as a separate production sector and government spending is not linked with government labor as in our setup.

GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUNS

27

circumstance, competition from production factors from increasing government spending can
lead to the economic effects as captured in the model with government production.

5. Government Investment Present-Value Multipliers
Government spending multipliers are often used to summarize the stimulative effects of
fiscal policy. We compute the present-value cumulative multipliers over 1000 years for output, consumption, and private investment responses to a shock that raises the present value
of government investment by one dollar. The length of 1000 years is long enough that our
calculations account for all the responses to the shock. The discount factor is constructed
based on the path of the interest rate responses. Compared with other measures of multipliers, such as peak responses to an initial change in a fiscal policy variable (as reported
in Blanchard and Perotti (2002)) or cumulative multipliers based on simple sums, our calculation gives a higher multiplier if the expansionary effect is more front-loaded relative to
the alternative pattern. For deficit-financed spending increases, where the cost of a stimulus
also includes debt service, this distinction is particularly important.
Actual government financing uses a complicated mix of fiscal adjustments [see Chung and
Leeper (2007) or Leeper, Plante, and Traum (2009)]. To compute multipliers, we consider
two classes of fiscal adjustments: all fiscal instruments, distorting and non-distorting, or only
lump-sum transfers adjust. When all the instruments adjust, the weight on each instrument
is calibrated to those estimated from data, as described in section 2.3. Because adjustment
in lump-sum taxes is the most common assumption imposed in macroeconomic studies, the
multipliers based only on lump-sum financing reveal the potential bias introduced by not
accounting for distorting financing.
Tables 3, 4, and 5 present the multipliers for both the distorting and the non-distorting
financing schemes and across four model specifications. The models are: M1 (main model in
section 2); M2 (government consumption and private consumption are complements—section
4.1; M3 (time-to-build for private capital—section 4.2); M4 (government production—section
4.3).
Productivity of public capital, αG , is the dominant factor determining the size of government investment multipliers. Since implementation delays mainly affect short-run dynamics,
they have relatively small effects on present-value multipliers. When αG = 0.1, output, consumption, and investment multipliers are larger than those under αG = 0.05 across the four
specifications of the models (the main model in section 2 and three alternative specifications
in section 4).
Multipliers are uniformly larger—often much larger—when government investment is financed by lump-sum transfers. When public capital is relatively productive (αG = 0.1),
output multipliers over two are commonplace under lump-sum financing. When government
capital is relatively unproductive (αG = 0.05), the output multipliers are still larger than
1 for most models. Even with lump-sum transfers financing, the range of output multipliers is quite large: they can even be negative when αG = 0.05 and government hires labor
and intermediate goods to produce its spending goods (M4) because private production falls
sharply due to a rising wage rate during initial years.

GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUNS

When distorting fiscal instruments finance government investment, the output multipliers
range from 2.18 to −1.61. When αG = 0.1, most cases have the output multipliers are bigger
than 1. When αG = 0.05, the only model that delivers a positive multiplier is when there is
time-to-build for private capital, mainly because total private investment falls less.
The consumption multipliers range from 1.03 to −1.51 with distorting financing and from
1.42 to −0.86 with lump-sum transfers financing. While all consumption multipliers with
distorting financing are negative when αG = 0.05, the majority are only slightly negative,
with the exception of the model with government production.
Finally, the investment multipliers range from 0.25 to −1.69 with distorting financing
and from 0.66 to −1.42 with lump-sum transfers financing. For most models we examine,
the investment multipliers are negative with only a few exceptions. Since investment falls
universally during the beginning years before turning positive for the models and calibrations
we examine, the cumulative, present-value multipliers are likely to be negative even though
investment turns positive in later years. Despite the small effect of implementation delays on
cumulative multipliers, there is some influence on private investment responses: the longer
the delay in government investment, the smaller the investment multipliers within a model
for a given αG .
The results presented here suggest a wide range of multipliers for government investment.
These multipliers are computed under the assumptions that either all fiscal instruments or
only lump-sum transfers are adjust to stabilize debt. If government relies more on raising
capital taxes, multipliers can become much more negative for all three variables. On the
other hand, if government relies more on cutting lump-sum transfers or raising labor income
taxes, multipliers can be larger. Finally, given the large difference in the output multipliers
between αG = 0.1 and αG = 0.05, the importance of productivity of public capital for fiscal
stimulus is apparent.
6. Concluding Remarks
This paper studies the macroeconomic effects of government investment in the short run
and long run. We show that a substantial time-to-build lag in a standard neoclassical model
can make expansions in government investment contractionary in the short run, at worst, and
have a muted impact, at best. This outcome is robust across different assumptions on fiscal
adjustments, productivities of public capital, the role of government consumption, and timeto-build for private capital. It is also robust to assuming that the government is a production
sector, where government investment directly generates jobs. Over longer horizons, we show
that the choice of fiscal adjustment instruments is important for minimizing the negative
effects from stabilizing government debt. The productivity of government investment is
also critical. The more productive is public capital, the less likely it is that government
investment is contractionary in the long run.
The neoclassical framework we employ is completely standard in macroeconomic research.
Nonetheless, it has its limitations, particularly in addressing the circumstances surrounding
the recession of 2007-2009. For example, one characteristic of the macroeconomic policy
response to the recession was that both fiscal policy and monetary policy reacted aggressively.
In fact, the Federal Reserve drove the federal funds rate to its zero bound in its efforts to

stimulate demand. Recent work has shown that government spending multipliers can be
substantially larger when coupled with such a monetary policy response [see, for example,
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2009) and Davig and Leeper (2009) who study only
unproductive government spending in models with nominal rigidities].
Despite its simplicity, the neoclassical model does highlight two important mechanisms
at work in the current environment: large government infrastructure projects take time to
build and, therefore, can have rather different impacts in the short run than in the long
run; how government investment ultimately gets financed matters a great deal for the longrun consequences of any fiscal package with a substantial infrastructure component. Both
mechanisms are integral to making accurate predictions of the effects of fiscal expansions
from government investment.

Appendix A. Deriving Aggregate Resource Constraint in the Model with
Government Production
Rewrite the government flow budget constraint of (24) as
et − wtLG .
Tt = τtL wt Lt + τtK rt utKt−1 + Bt − Rt−1 Bt−1 − G
t

(30)

Combining (30) with the agent’s budget constraint (3), and then applying the aggregate
labor constraint (27) to get
et = rt utKt−1 + wt LP .
Ct + It + ψ(ut)Kt−1 + G
(31)
t

Using the equilibrium condition (22) for private prediction in (31), we obtain an expression
for private output,
et .
YtP = Ct + It + ψ(ut)Kt−1 + G
(32)
Next, combine private output (32) with the expression for government output (23), we have
I
YtP + YtG = Ct + It + ψ(ut)Kt−1 + GC
t + Gt = Yt ,

(33)

which is equivalent to equation (8). Since the product side and income side of an economy
must coincide, the model implies the resource value of government output equals the cost to
produce them. In other words,
et + wtLG .
GC + GI = G
