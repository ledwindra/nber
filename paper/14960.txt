ABSTRACT
Investment of U.S. firms responds asymmetrically to Tobin’s Q: investment of established firms —
‘intensive’ investment — reacts negatively to Q whereas investment of new firms — ‘extensive’
investment — responds positively and elastically to Q. This asymmetry, we argue, reflects a difference
between established and new firms in the cost of adopting new technologies. A fall in the compatibility
of new capital with old capital raises measured Q and reduces the incentive of established firms to
invest. New firms do not face such compatibility costs and step up their investment in response to
the rise in Q. The model fits the data well using aggregates since 1900.

Abstract
Investment of U.S. firms responds asymmetrically to Tobin’s Q: investment
of established firms — ‘intensive’ investment — reacts negatively to  whereas
investment of new firms — ‘extensive’ investment — responds positively and
elastically to . This asymmetry, we argue, reflects a diﬀerence between established and new firms in the cost of adopting new technologies. A fall in the
compatibility of new capital with old capital raises measured  and reduces
the incentive of established firms to invest. New firms do not face such compatibility costs and step up their investment in response to the rise in  The
model fits the data well using aggregates since 1900.

Introduction

Extensive and intensive labor supply has been modeled at the individual-worker level
(Cogan 1981) and at the aggregate level (Cho and Cooley 1993, Cho and Rogerson
1998). Extensive labor supply — movement in and out of the labor market — is more
wage elastic than intensive labor supply — the hours of employed workers.
An even starker contrast exists between the response to aggregate Tobin’s  of
extensive investment — capital formation by entering firms and young firms — and the
response by intensive investment — capital formation by older firms and listed firms.
When aggregate  rises, new firms and young firms raise their investment, whereas
older, publicly listed firms reduce theirs.
To explain the puzzle we use a model in which movements in  are caused by
changes in the cost of capital that aﬀect continuing projects but not new ones. Technological change raises the cost of making new capital compatible with capital already in place. Fitting new wiring or new equipment into an old building originally

designed for something else is costly. Retraining workers who originally were trained
to do something else is also costly. If the arrival of new technology precedes high periods, then a high  is the result of high costs of adjustment that reflect this
incompatibility. Chari and Hopenhayn (1991) have a model in this general spirit,
though it is steady-state growth with no variation in .
Gilchrist and Williams (2000) and Campbell (1998) estimate vintage-capital models closely related to ours. They too assume a distribution of new investment opportunities each period. Once implemented, the capital that the project embodies cannot
be augmented at a later date.1 Our model relaxes this assumption; it allows firms to
invest in continuing projects and the shock to this intensive investment technology is
of overriding importance. Investment in capital of the latest vintage (new projects)
is estimated to be a small component of the total and is distinguished from investment in capital of older vintages (continuing projects). Furthermore, this intensive
investment technology is, at any date, equally eﬃcient regardless of the vintage of
the project. Thus, while not a full-blown vintage-capital model, the model we end
up with can be solved by hand.
We interpret the shock to the intensive-investment technology as a cost of making new and old capital compatible, or as a cost of adapting old processes to new
technology. Yorukoglu (1998) interprets his investment-cost shock similarly. Our distinction between extensive investment (in new projects) and intensive investment (in
continuing projects) is also similar to one made by Acemoglu, Gancia and Zilibotti
(2010) between innovation and standardization costs. Similarly, Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambelotti (forthcoming) distinguish shocks to the supply of capital goods
from shocks to the investment adjustment cost for installed capital, and find that the
latter play a large role in explaining fluctuations. Jovanovic (2009) relates the implementation cost to a depleted stock of investment options. Prusa and Schmitz (1991,
1994) find that firms pursue less radical forms of innovation as they age, presumably
because they face such compatibility, adaptability and standardization costs.
The value of capital in place is determined solely by the cost of intensive investment and when that cost rises, we see a substitution towards extensive investment
(which is not subject to this shock) and a rise in the stock market and in . This
is the mechanism that explains the asymmetry. Over the cycle, the mechanism has
a smoothing eﬀect on investment because the new-project technology is not aﬀected
by the implementation shock that drives aggregate investment.
The model also includes a TFP shock, which is important for explaining other
features of the time series but is not involved in generating the asymmetry. Thus as
in Greenwood, Hercowicz, and Krusell (1997) and Fisher (2006), we have a TFP shock
and a shock to the cost of capital, except that the latter applies only to continuing
projects.

Bilbiie et al. (2007) in their Sec. 5 briefly extend to allow variable plant size but
do not study the issue of diﬀerential elasticity of extensive and intensive investment.

The model assumes two assets. The first is a claim to dividends of the portfolio
of all continuing projects run by incumbent firms. The second is a private-equity
fund that finances all new projects and sells them to incumbent firms or equivalently
as IPOs in the form of new firms. Earlier versions of this paper assumed that new
projects were developed by incumbents as spin-outs, as in Franco and Filson (2006),
Chatterjee and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) and (implicitly) Prescott and Boyd (1987).2
The next section presents the evidence that motivates the paper, and Section
3 presents the model. Section 4 fits the model to the time series of investment —
extensive and intensive — and Section 5 contrasts the model to the standard model
with just one investment. Section 6 relaxes the assumption that continuing projects
are homogeneous. Section 7 concludes.

Evidence on Investment and Q

The patterns that we outline above can be seen in both aggregate and sectoral data.
Here we summarize that evidence.
Investment of Compustat firms is negatively related to aggregate .–Standard
and Poor’s Compustat database consists of public firms that we generally think of
as incumbents. The investment rates of these listed firms depend positively on their
own ’s but negatively on aggregate . Figure 1 illustrates this, where the left panel
shows a mildly positive relation between firm-level investment and firm-specific ’s in
a pooled ordinary least squares regression using data from 1962 through 2006.3 This
is consistent with the standard -theory of investment, which suggests that high firms will have higher desired investment rates than low- firms. Interestingly,
the right panel shows our new fact that investment rates of the same Compustat
firms respond negatively to aggregate , with the observations on the horizontal axis
ordered by the unweighted annual averages of the firm-specific ’s. Tables B.1 and
B.2 in Appendix B show that the relationships in Figure 1 are robust to the inclusion
of fixed eﬀects for years and two-digit standard industry classifications (SICs), and
to estimation by GMM to control for potential measurement error in .
The same contrast emerges in another set of regressions that use the same Compustat data displayed in Figure 1. Firm ’s investment in year  as a percentage of its
capital stock at the start of the year is denoted by () , aggregate  is denoted
by  and firm ’s deviation from it by  −  . Once again estimation is by OLS.
2

The investment implications do not hinge on the assumed mechanism, but Gompers (2002) shows that IPOs of VC-funded new projects and private sales to firms of
such projects outweigh IPOs and private sales of spinouts by a factor of eight or nine.

with 2 =.01 and 160,580 firm-level observations. With fixed eﬀects for two-digit SIC
industries, the coeﬃcient for  becomes -0.133, suggesting an even stronger negative
elasticity of investment to aggregate , and the coeﬃcient for ( −  ) falls slightly
to 0.012. Both coeﬃcients remain highly significant statistically and the 2 rises to
0.85. Table 1 shows that this negative aggregate -elasticity of investment also holds
for firms in five broadly-defined sectors, with the eﬀects of  on investment strongest
for business and industrial firms and for biotech and healthcare firms.
Investment by young firms is positively related to aggregate .–Although all Compustat firms are what we would call incumbents, the firms that listed recently are most
likely to exhibit investment behavior similar to that of new firms. To us, this means
that the investment rates of recent listings could well be positively related to  even
though investment rates of the entire pool of incumbents are negatively related to
 . Table 2 shows that this is indeed the case, with columns 1-2 and 5-6 indicating
a strong and positive elasticity of investment to aggregate  for firms that had been
listed for two years or less and three years or less, respectively. And as we would
expect, the size of the positive coeﬃcient on  is larger for the former (i.e., narrower) definition of “young” firms. At the same time, and again as expected, the
complement of firms listed less recently in columns 3-4 and 7-8 have an even more

Notes: Estimation is by OLS with T-statistics based on robust standard errors in parentheses. The independent variable Q j, t-1 is the mean Tobin’s Q
of all Compustat firms in broadly-defined sector j at the end of the previous year. The independent variable Q i, t-1 – Q j, t-1 is the difference between
the individual firm’s Q i and its broad sectoral average, Q j. The broadly-defined sectors are the same as those used in Gompers et al. (2008). They
aggregate the 69 sectors defined by Thomson Venture Economics into nine broader sectors, including the five that we consider here. We then assign
Compustat firms to these broad sectors using a mapping from three-digit SIC industries provided by Anna Kovner. The mapping is not exclusive, as
a given three-digit SIC code can be associated with more than one broadly-defined sector. Thus, some three-digit SIC codes and their associated
firms appear in more than one of the sectoral regressions above. Table B.3 in Appendix B provides details of the mapping. Our regressions with
industry fixed effects control for variation across the narrower SIC sectors within each broad sector at the two-digit level.

deeply negative aggregate -elasticity than the entire set of Compustat firms.
Venture capital flows into young firms.–A systematic source of micro evidence on
entering firms is Thomson’s VentureXpert sample of venture-backed firms. Venture
capitalists (VCs) invest almost exclusively in start-up firms. One cannot compute a
firm-specific  for these firms, but one can use the  that prevails for listed firms
in particular sectors. Gompers et al. (2008, Table 4-5, pp. 11-12) show that VC
investments have responded elastically to  for their sector using annual data from
1975 to 1998. In particular, OLS regressions of the annual number of investments
in each of 69 VentureXpert sectors on one-year lags of their average sectoral ’s
(computed as market-to-book ratios from Compustat) deliver a coeﬃcient on  of
0.330 in a specification without year or industry fixed eﬀects and a coeﬃcient of 0.172
with year and industry eﬀects included. They also obtain a coeﬃcient on  of 0.043
when regressing firm-level investment on sectoral ’s with fixed eﬀects for industries
and years. Thus they find a strong positive response by VC-backed firms to sectorspecific s in same sectors for which our Table 1 documents a significant negative
response by the Compustat firms.
In sum, aggregate data as well as micro evidence from Compustat and VenturXpert
show a clear asymmetry in the response of investment to changes in aggregate .
Entering and young firms respond positively, while older firms respond negatively to
changes in aggregate . We now present a model that explains the phenomenon.

Model

The output of the final good depends on capital, , and on a technology shock :
output = 
The law of motion for capital is
0 = (1 − )  +  + 

(1)

where  represents capital produced in continuing projects, and  is capital produced
in new projects.
() Continuing projects.–Continuing projects can be enlarged at the gross rate of
return of 1, which is the same over all continuing projects. That is, an investment
today of  units of the consumption good in an existing project yields one unit of
new capital. Then if the capital created via existing projects is , the total cost is
.
() New projects.–A project uses as inputs a unit of the consumption good and
an idea. As output it delivers  units of capital in the following period. The quality,
, of the project is known at the start. New projects are born each period, and
their quality is distributed with a C.D.F.  () with density  (). Ideas arrive in
7

proportion to the size of the capital stock. Thus the unnormalized distribution of
new ideas is  (). Ideas cannot be stored. Idea quality is evaluated privately by
venture funds — an agent does not know the  of his own idea.
We pause to note two diﬀerences in how investment in new and old projects is
treated.
Contracting between agents and venture funds.–All ideas are submitted to venture
funds for evaluation. A fund pays the idea’s owner only if it uses the idea to float
an IPO or sells the capital privately to an incumbent firm, either way receiving the
price of  per unit. There are no long-term contracts, and contracts cannot condition
on .4 Up front payments by the venture fund cannot be made because anyone could
pretend to have an idea and collect the payment. Ex post, payment cannot be made
conditional on  because the fund would always claim that the idea was of the lowest
quality acceptable. Therefore the fund pays the minimum that it takes to get the
idea owner to develop the project, and that payment is unity. Since the fund knows
it can get  for the idea, it will implement all projects with
≥

so that m is the quality of the marginal project. The fund sells the projects to the

This is a bit unrealistic because a firm’s founder at IPO often does have a considerable stake in the firm. Nevertheless, the VC does have the majority share and

term in (5) measured per unit of . Moreover, (2) and (6) imply that the marginal
costs of capital entailed in the two investment margins are equal:5
0 () = 

(7)

The determination of investment.–Figure 2 illustrates the eﬀect of a rise in  when
 is held constant. Investment, , equals savings which are determined by households’
savings decisions (to be described presently). The households’ demand for investment
is negatively sloped because a rise in  raises the cost of future consumption and
reduces the demand for it (see (11)). The investment rate (i.e., supply) of entering
capital is determined by (7) and increasing in ; this is the positively-sloped function
in Figure (2). Incumbent investment takes up the slack between the demand for 
and the supply of . As  rises, two things happen: first, savings decline so that 
falls from 1 to 2 ; second, the supply of entrants rises from 1 to 2 . Therefore  falls
by more than .6 As  rises, on the other hand, the downward-sloping savings curve
in Figure 2 shifts to the right (see (11). This causes both  and  to rise.
5

This is because 0 () = − (m ) m  and m  = 1m  (m ) 

6

These implications remain valid under a more general specification: rewrite (5)
as  =  −  −  (). Thus  raises the costs of incumbents but not that of entrants.
Suppose, instead, that the resource constraint were  =  −  −   () with  6= 0.
Then instead of (7) the FOC would be 0 () = 1− and the conclusions illustrated
in Figure 2 would remain qualitatively intact so long as   1. That is,  would be
increasing in  and  would be decreasing in . If, on the other hand,  = 1,  would

Let  ≡ ( ) be the state, assumed i.i.d. with distribution  (). Contemporaneously,  and  may be correlated. The i.i.d. assumption lets us solve explicitly and
discuss results intuitively, but simulations reported in earlier versions of the paper
(e.g., Jovanovic and Rousseau 2009) show that the results are largely unchanged if 
follows a first-order Markov process.
The state of the economy is ( ), but since returns are constant and preferences
homothetic,  aﬀects neither interest rates nor investment rates.
The equilibrium price of capital.–We shall assume that, as in Figure 2, the size
of entering ideas is too small to aﬀect today’s market price  of the marginal unit of
capital. A price higher than  would draw forth an investment level  that is larger
than the supply of savings on the part of households. Moreover, since the quality, ,
of each new project is public knowledge ex ante, the shares of such an entering firm
will sell at a price of  where established firms bid for the capital to the point at
which its value equals its cost.
Assets.–The household may own two assets:
() Private equity.–The price is  ()  per share in the private-equity fund, and
a share pays dividend  () . The fund manages only new projects and sells them
right away, and benefits through an external eﬀect from the growth of .
() Public equity.–The number of firms is fixed and the size of the representative
firm is proportional to . The purchase of new capital ( created by the consumptiongood-conversion technology at the cost of  per unit and  by a purchase from the
private-equity funds at the price of  per unit) is financed by a withdrawal of  ( + )
from the firm’s earnings. This reduces dividends but leads to exactly oﬀsetting capital
gains because the new capital is valued at  per unit as long as  ()  0 in equilibrium
for all .7 Thus the dividends of the public-equity fund are  regardless of its
investment activity and the price per share is .
The household’s budget constraint.–After dividing both sides by , the constraint
is
0 +  0 +  = ( + )  + ( + ) 
where  is the number of units of capital of the representative firm that the household
owns and  = . In equilibrium  =  = 1. As in Lucas (1978), we substitute
then be a constant, depending neither on  nor on  and would solve the equation
0 () = 1. But  would still be decreasing in  .
7
This ensures that the economy is never at a zero- corner where  could be less
than the reproduction cost as was the case in Sargent (1980).

The multiplicative factor (1 −  + ) =  0  in (9) corrects for the growth of the
capital stock to which prices and dividends are proportional. It is absent from (8)
because the capital gains it implies are oﬀset exactly by the cost of investment.
Analysis.–Since utility is homothetic and returns are constant, the solution is of
the form  =  () . Moreover, we derive the following solutions in Appendix C:
Proposition 1 (homogeneous x). Constants   0 and   0 are defined in (19)

Recall that the magnitudes given in (10)-(12) are all relative to . At this point
we note the following:
1. Using (11) and (3), we can solve for  =  − .

4. Wealth is  +  = [1 + (1 −  +  [ ]) ] , so that it depends positively on 

(14)

The series .–In our model,  is driven by hidden implementation costs. When
we come to the data, this will mean that  represents a shock relative to the price of
capital that the BLS measures and uses to construct its estimated stock of capital.
Therefore measured  equals the model’s  When compatibility problems cause
reproduction costs of incumbents to rise, this will not enter their book values (i.e.,
the denominator of measured ), and this generates a measurement error that raises
measured . The model normalizes the measured cost of capital to unity, which
means that we implicitly assume that the price index for capital goods is correctly
used by the BLS when constructing the capital stock numbers that we shall use here.
The series .–We compute it as − IPO = 
The series  .–IPO values relative to the capital stock are interpreted as  This
is the value of the composite capital stock brought into the stock market. Division
by  yields 
Calculating .–Since output is , we measure  by the ratio of private output
over the course of a given year to private capital at the start of that year. That is,
 =   for all .
Calculating .–For , we use the ratio of market-to-book values of tangible capital
in the entire non-financial corporate sector.8
Of the six parameters, one is not identified — our data identify only the product

0 , and not  and 0 separately, and so we chose 0 = 1 max  so that the economy
always has a marginal new project, even at the highest sample value of . The discount
factor  was fixed at 0.95 Then the algorithm first chooses ( ) to fit the  series.
In view of (14), this does not involve other parameters. With ( ) thus obtained, the
algorithm then chooses ( ) to fit the long-run growth of output (given by ̄ + ̄ − )
per head of 1.5 percent, and to explain as much as possible of the variation in  and
.9 Table 3 reports the parameter values.

Simulation requires that we solve for the constant , which can only be done
numerically. To obtain estimates of  = 326 and  = 00034, we fitted a bivariate
log-normal distribution of ( ) to the data and then used this distribution in (19)
and (20) to solve for  and .

The resulting fit of the model is in Figure 3, and the time series for ( ) is given
in Figure 4.10
The early years of the Great Depression feature an extremely low  and the
constraint  ≥ 0 is violated during the period 1931-34. This period includes extreme
events under which (8) holds as an inequality, as in Sargent (1980). But under the
estimated  (), the violation occurs very rarely, namely one-third of a percent of the
time. If we did impose non-negativity of  in all dates we believe that the optimal
solution (which we then can no longer solve explicitly) would remain very close to that
given by (10) and (11). In its desire to avoid excessive variation in , the curvature
parameter  is estimated to be very large. As  → 0 it becomes impossible for the
condition to hold in the face of even moderate variation in .

Comparison to the one-investment model

In a one-investment model, the income identity would read
 +  = 
In our model it reads
 +  =  + 
where  is given in (4). The parameters determining  are  and  (·). A neutral
rise in the flow of ideas is simply a rise in . It raises  in (4) and this is a positive
wealth eﬀect on current and future consumption. From (19) it is easy to see that 
is decreasing in  which means in (10) that
 ( )
0


all ( ) 

The eﬀect on  cannot be signed.
10

The correlations are (   ) = 0.243, (  −1 ) = 0.762 and (  −1 ) = .861.

Figure 5: The model economy with =0.28 and with =0, 1901-2005.
We now simulate  and  for the economy with the parameters as in Table 3,
followed by a simulation of  and  for an economy with all its parameters unchanged
except that now  = 0. Figure 5 reports the percentage increase in  and  that the
increase in  from zero to 0028 brings about. As (15) implies, consumption rises
uniformly, on average by four fifths of one percent. The percentage eﬀect on  is on
average larger — about three percent — but it is non-monotonic, being negative in
periods when  is low.
In short, the presence of  has a larger cyclical consequence on  than it has on 
— the latter rises in all states ( ). As for , the presence of  plays a smoothing role.
I.e., the new-project margin induces a smaller decline in aggregate investment when
 rises, which is not surprising since the new-project sector is immune to the adverse
implementation-cost shock. The net result is a smoother investment series than we
would see if the  investment were not present.

Heterogeneity in continuing-project investments

We now show the results are robust to adding heterogeneity in . So far we assumed
that all continuing projects could augment their capital at a unit cost of . Suppose,
instead that continuing projects are heterogeneous. Suppose that each project delivers
a unit of capital tomorrow, but that the cost,  is project-specific, and suppose that

(16)
The parameter  is an index of heterogeneity of continuing projects. As  → 0 we
get the homogeneous case in which on continuing-projects, each unit of capital costs
. But the equilibrium price of shares, call it ̂, now depends on  and  and we do
not have an analytic solution for it, but the Appendix proves the following result:

16

Figure 6 shows a simulated version of Figure 3, and then add two supply curves
for  covering the case   0, each pertaining to a hypothetical realization of the
shock . When   0 one must distinguish ̂ from , and so the vertical axis now
measures ̂ and the curves  (̂) and  (̂) both are represented as functions of this
variable, although the functional forms are taken from (10) and (11) so that they are
correct only for the case  = 0 The curve  (̂) plots (11) evaluated at the sample
mean value  = 036. The supply of new projects  (̂). We draw the supply curve
for  for  ∈ {1 2} and for  ∈ {0 2}. We also plot the supply of new projects  ()
from (14) at the values of 0  , and  given in Table 1.
We must distinguish the price of capital, ̂, from the shock . Note that at
 = 2, the variance in the distribution of the costs ³of continuing
projects is infinite,

of continuing projects is more elastic not because their entire population is more
homogenous but, rather, because there are far fewer new projects (measuring in total
 = 0025) than continuing projects (measuring unity in total), so that among the
implemented new projects the variance is larger.

Conclusion

We have documented an asymmetry in the response of investment to aggregate :
Small and young firms respond positively to it, while large and old firms respond
negatively. We argue that this occurs because a high  is a signal of low compatibility
of old capital with the new and, hence, of high implementation costs specific to
incumbents alone. Entrants do not face compatibility problems because they start de
novo, and raise their investment when the cost is high.
Introducing the second, new-project margin into a one-investment model dampens
the time-series variation in investment, raising investment in states when the implementation cost is high and lowering it in states when the cost is low. There seems to
be little or no eﬀect on consumption variation.
Finally, variations in the implementation cost are driven by technological change.
On this view, aggregate stock-price volatility is caused by technological change, a
property that our model shares with other models that feature shocks to the cost of
investment.

Appendix A. Data and Methods

In this appendix we document the data sources and methods used to construct the
series depicted in our figures and included in the empirical analysis.
Figure 1 .–The investment rate of an individual firm (i.e., (() ) is its annual
expenditures on property, plant, and equipment (Compustat item 30) as a percentage
17

of its total assets at the start of the year (item 6). We compute the firm-specific 
using year-end data from Compustat. The numerator of  is the value of a firm’s
common equity at current share prices (the product of Compustat items 24 and 25),
to which we add the book values of preferred stock (item 130) and of long and shortterm debt (items 9 and 34). We use book values of preferred stock and debt in the
numerator because prices of preferred stocks are not available from Compustat and we
do not have information on issue dates for debt from which we might better estimate
market value. Book values of these components are reasonable approximations of
market values so long as interest rates do not vary excessively. The denominator of 
is computed in the same way except that book value of common equity (Compustat
item 60) is used in place of market value. Our micro-based  measures thus focus on
the value of a firm’s outstanding securities and implicitly assume that the proceeds of
these issues are fully applied to the formation of capital, both physical and intangible.
Figure 3 .–To construct the  series shown in the upper panel of Figure 3, we
begin with the value of IPOs as a proxy for the numerator,  . This is measured as
the aggregate year-end market value of the common stock of all firms that enter the
University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) files in each
year from 1925 through 2005, excluding American Depository Receipts. The CRSP
files include listings only from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) from 1925 until
1961, with American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ firms joining in 1962 and 1972
respectively. This generates large entry rates in 1962 and 1972 that for the most part
do not reflect initial public oﬀerings. Because of this, we linearly interpolate between
entry rates in 1961 and 1963 and between 1971 and 1973, and assign these values to
the years 1962 and 1972 respectively. For 1901-1924 we obtain market values of firms
that list for the first time on the NYSE using our pre-CRSP database of stock prices,
par values, and book capitalizations that we collected for all common stocks traded on
the NYSE using the The Commercial and Financial Chronicle, Bradstreet’s, The New
York Times, and The Annalist (see Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2001). We measure the
denominator, −1 , as the previous end-of-year stock of private fixed assets from the
BEA (2006, Table 6.1, line 1) for 1925 through 2005. For 1900-1924, we use annual
estimates from Goldsmith (1955, Vol. 3, Table W-1, col. 2, pp. 14-15) that include
reproducible, tangible assets (i.e., structures, equipment, and inventories), and then
subtract government structures (col. 3), public inventories (col. 17), and monetary
gold and silver (col. 18). We then join the result with the BEA series and divide by
aggregate  (described below).
To construct the  series shown in the lower panel of Figure 3, we measure
the numerator,  , as annual gross private domestic investment from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA 2006, Table 5.2.5, line 4) for 1929-2005, to which we join
estimates from Kendrick (1961, Table A-IIb, column 5, pp. 296-7) for 1901-1928. We
then divide the result by −1 .
Figure 4 .–For  , we use private output, defined as GDP less government expenditures on consumption and investment from the BEA (2006) for 1929-2005, to which
18

we join Kendrick’s (1961, Table A-IIb, pp. 296-7, col. 11) estimates of gross national
product less government for 1901-2005. We then divide the result by −1 .
For aggregate  , we use fourth quarter observations underlying Hall (2001) for
1950-99, and then join them with estimates underlying Abel and Eberly (2008) for
1999 to 2005. These authors derive aggregate Tobin’s  from the Federal Reserve
Board’s Flow of Funds Accounts as the ratio of market-to-book values for tangible
assets in the entire non-financial corporate sector. We then bring the aggregate 
series back to 1901 by ratio splicing the “equity ” measure underlying Wright (2004).
Hall’s measure of  exceeds Wright’s by factor of more than 1.5 in 1950, when the
splice occurs, producing  ’s before 1950 that are considerably higher than Wright’s
published estimates. We also note that these measures of aggregate  are generally
smaller than the ones that we constructed for 1962 through 2006 as averages of firmlevel data for use in our regression analysis. The diﬀerence arises for two reasons.
First, since Compustat and our backward extension only cover firms that are listed
on organized stock exchanges, the micro-based sample is focused on larger and more
successful firms. Second, our micro-based measure of  is based on market and book
values of a firm’s outstanding securities issues (see notes for Figure 1), the proceeds
of which are spent on physical capital and intangibles. Since intangibles probably
form an important part of the forward-looking component of stock prices, we might
expect our micro-based measures of  to exceed those based upon tangibles alone.
At the same time, our micro and macro series are highly correlated, with  = 0.92 in
their period of overlap (i.e., 1962-2005).

Appendix B. Robustness of Results in Figure 1

In this appendix we show the robustness of the regressions in Figure 1 to the inclusion
of fixed eﬀects for years and two-digit SIC industries, as well as to estimation with
GMM using higher-order moments. Table B.1 includes several regressions that are
similar to the one depicted in the left panel of Figure 1. We continue to use OLS in
the left panel of Table B.1 so that the first column simply repeats the result shown
in left panel of Figure 1. In the second column we add fixed eﬀects for years to the
specification, and we include fixed eﬀects for two-digit SIC industries in addition to
the year eﬀects in the third column. All three regressions show a positive relation
between a firm’s own  and its subsequent investment.
Erickson and Whited (2000, 2002) propose a method for estimating investment
regressions that yields consistency in the presence of measurement error in . The
technique uses higher-order moments of the −1 as instruments for −1 . We
estimated these models using the third, fourth, and fifth moments as instruments in
the center panel of Table B.1 and using the third through sixth moments in the right
panel. In all cases the coeﬃcients on −1 are even larger than those obtained with
OLS and remain positive and statistically significant at the one percent level.

when estimated with GMM.

Proof of Proposition 2: When projects with  ∈ [0  max ] are implemented, the
number of new machines (per unit of ) built is
=1−

Now, when the marginal project just breaks even,  max = ̂, and we have (18). Solving
(21) for the marginal project yields
 max =  (1 − )− 

(22)

Letting  () denote the unnormalized C.D.F. defined in (16), the cost of , per
unit of , is

Since the cost is in units of today’s goods, this implies (17).
