    "abstract": "\n\nGiven the use of an individual\u2019s arrest history for many economic and social outcomes, reducing conviction\u2010less arrests (arrests that result in no charges or where the defendant is found not guilty) is an important policy goal. This paper examines which officers are making conviction\u2010less arrests, and whether these arrests can be reduced with increased oversight. Using the Chicago Police Department\u2019s rotational duty calendar to obtain plausibly exogenous variation in the set of officers assigned to work on a particular day, we find that arrests made by officers with high misconduct are 10.5% less likely than the arrests made by no\u2010misconduct officers to result in charges and are 14% more likely to have a \u201cNot Guilty\u201d outcome. We also analyze two events that increased the transparency of police misconduct through public disclosure of complaint records and find that increased oversight reduces conviction\u2010less arrests, but with important nuances across misconduct profiles. While no\u2010 and low\u2010misconduct officers are responsive to oversight mechanisms, high\u2010misconduct officers are less responsive.\n\n",
