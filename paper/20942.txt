ABSTRACT
A common complaint about online auctions for consumer goods is the presence of "snipers," who
place bids in the final seconds of sequential ascending auctions with predetermined ending times. The
literature conjectures that snipers are best-responding to the existence of "incremental" bidders that
bid up to their valuation only as they are outbid. Snipers aim to catch these incremental bidders at
a price below their reserve, with no time to respond. As a consequence, these incremental bidders may
experience regret when they are outbid at the last moment at a price below their reservation value. We
measure the effect of this experience on a new buyer's propensity to participate in future auctions.
We show the effect to be causal using a carefully selected subset of auctions from eBay.com and
instrumental variables estimation strategy. Bidders respond to sniping quite strongly and are between
4 and 18 percent less likely to return to the platform.

ABSTRACT
A common complaint about online auctions for consumer
goods is the presence of “snipers,” who place bids in the final seconds of sequential ascending auctions with predetermined ending times. The literature conjectures that snipers
are best-responding to the existence of “incremental” bidders that bid up to their valuation only as they are outbid.
Snipers aim to catch these incremental bidders at a price
below their reserve, with no time to respond. As a consequence, these incremental bidders may experience regret
when they are outbid at the last moment at a price below
their reservation value. We measure the effect of this experience on a new buyer’s propensity to participate in future
auctions. We show the effect to be causal using a carefully
selected subset of auctions from eBay.com and instrumental
variables estimation strategy. Bidders respond to sniping
quite strongly and are between 4 and 18 percent less likely
to return to the platform.

possible moment.1 In this paper we explore the effects of
losing an auction to such a late bidder, in particular how
such an experience affects the future participation of buyers
in online auctions. We show that being sniped has a negative impact on the sniped new bidders’ likelihood of bidding
again.
The pioneering papers in this literature, Roth and Ockenfels (2002) and Bajari and Hortaçsu (2003), document the
prevalence of sniping on eBay and offer some explanations
that rationalize this behavior. The most commonly accepted
explanation, which was suggested by Roth and Ockenfels
(2002) and is also explored in Gray and Reiley (2004), shows
that if there are some naı̈ve bidders who do not understand
the “proxy bidding” nature of online auctions, and instead
choose to raise their bid every time they are outbid by others
like in an English auction, then sniping by rational bidders
will be a best response.2 The argument rests on the fact
that if a rational bidder faces an “incremental” naı̈ve bidder,
then by bidding at the very last moment he will not offer
the incremental bidder enough time to raise the bid further,
and hence the rational player will win the auction at a lower
price than he would if he bid earlier.3

INTRODUCTION

The rise of online marketplaces in general, and auction platforms such as eBay in particular, has offered researchers new
sources of detailed data on the behavior of market participants. Over the past decade, there has been a growing
literature focusing on auction ending rules and how these
influence late-bidding behavior, often referred to as “sniping,” where some bidders submit their bid at the very last
∗

We explore a natural prediction from this framework: if a
naı̈ve bidder does not anticipate being sniped, and as a result
is upset from being sniped, the bidder should be discouraged
from participating in future auctions. We develop a test for
this prediction and quantify the long term effects on these
incremental bidders which measures the magnitude of the

Sniping is a well known practice on eBay.com, and is
discussed in detail in its buying guides (http://www.

Proxy bidding mechanisms are akin to second-price auctions and work as follows: a bidder submits his non-proxy
bid which represents his maximum willingness to pay. As
subsequent bids are submitted, the auction mechanism registers the current price as one increment above the second
highest proxy bid and current winner as the highest proxy
bidder.
3
Another popular explanation is that snipers are informed
bidders who wish to hide their information from less informed bidders in a common-values setting. While the identities of the bidders are masked on eBay, the feedback score
and other data which can proxy for experience, are visible.
The results in Bajari and Hortaçsu (2003) are suggestive of
this story playing a role.

externality imposed by snipers using a revealed preference
approach.
Using data from eBay we indeed observe that there are many
incremental bidders —as many as 30 percent of bidders have
bid more than once in an auction. As many as 30 percent of
auctions have bids in the last 10 seconds of the auction, supporting the literature’s prior evidence that sniping is prevalent. Prior studies, however, have been unable to explore
longer term effects.
Figure 1 suggests that there may be negative impacts to
the marketplace from sniping. The horizontal axis shows
the time remaining from the end of the auction at which
a bidder who was winning the auction got outbid by some
other bidder. The vertical axis shows the probability that
the bidder who was outbid will not return in the future to
bid on another auction.4 As the figure demonstrates, there
is a rapid rise in the probability of not bidding ever again
in a later auction as the time remaining from the end of the
auction drops below a fraction of a minute (about 20 seconds). This means that being outbid in the last few seconds
will cause the outbid bidder to vote with his feet and be less
likely to return to bid on eBay.

To begin our analysis, we first define what it means to be
sniped. We consider new eBay bidders who are all the high
bidders with 5 minutes remaining until their auctions close.
We then remove those bidders who ultimately win the auction. Hence, only new users who were winning at 5 minutes
before the auction, but lost in the last five minutes, are considered. We define a bidder as sniped if he is outbid in the
last 3 seconds. If he is outbid any earlier in the last 5 minutes, he will become part of the control group of losers who
were not sniped. Hence, the empirical exercise compares
how sniped bidders behave in the future compared to losers
who were not sniped. Using a simple probit regression we
first analyze the probability of leaving the site conditional

on being sniped. The basic analysis shows that the likelihood that bidders who were sniped do not return to bid on
eBay is about 3.5 percentage points higher than those who
lose without being sniped, who fail to return 49 percent of
the time.
Despite being suggestive, the simple plot in Figure 1, as well
as regressions controlling for other variables such as price,
category, etc., may suffer from endogeneity problems. In
particular, sniping is more likely to occur in markets where
there are few bidders.5 It is these kind of markets for which
a marketplace like eBay is most attractive to buyers, implying that bidders in these markets may be more likely to
return to eBay. Hence, a positive correlation between sniping and auction thinness, and a positive correlation between
auction thinness and the likelihood of returning to eBay, will
bias downward any effect that sniping has on bidders ceasing
to bid in auctions. We indeed demonstrate a positive correlation between sniping and market thinness, and develop
another approach to measuring the true causal effect.
We use an instrumental variable (IV) strategy to address
this concern. There are two ways that bidding occurs on
eBay. First, bidders can manually insert their bid into the
proxy bidding system. Second, bidders can use sniping software that does this automatically in the last seconds of the
auction without their attentiveness. At nighttime, there are
fewer manual bidders active on the site, and consistent with
this we observe that more auctions are won by snipers. However, 10pm in New York is only 7pm in San Francisco, while
10pm in San Francisco is 1am in New York. Therefore the
10pm San Francisco bidder is much more likely to be sniped
than a 10pm New York bidder. If these bidders are otherwise comparable conditional on observables, then one can
use their respective time zones as an instrument for variation in the likelihood of being sniped. This is the basis of
our IV strategy.
To implement the IV approach outlined above, we use a
bivariate probit regression model with local time of day and
server time of day dummies as instruments to capture the
exogenous variation in sniping that is due to more or less
people from different time zones being awake and able to
snipe. The estimates from the IV approach are much larger
than the simple probit results: on average, the likelihood
that bidders who were sniped do not return to bid on eBay
is about 18 percentage points higher than those who lose
without being sniped.
These results show that bidders respond quite strongly to
being sniped.6 It is quite clear that rational bidders, who
bid their valuation and lose, should not be upset and then
vote with their feet.7 Hence, this behavior suggests that not
only are there bidders who do not seem to understand the
rules of proxy bidding, but a significant number of those are

Users often voice their distate for snipers on eBay on forums
and blogs.

Losing bidders may choose not to return to auctions if they
believe that prices are not a good enough deal to justify the
time spent on bidding. However, there is no reason that
rational bidders will choose not to return disproportionately
if they lost in the very last seconds of the auction.

upset by the prospect of losing without being able to submit
a counter-bid, and then chose not to bid on future auctions.
As a result, sniping has a negative impact on the growth
rate of the auction platform.

There is an extensive literature on sniping in auction markets which seeks to answer two questions. The first is why
bidders are willing to pay nonzero costs to snipe.8 As Zeithammer and Adams (2010) emphasize, this fact is inconsistent with the sealed-bid abstraction which renders auction markets so empirically tractable. They show that the
salience of sniping is a challenge to the theoretical underpinnings of much empirical work on auctions. The second
question is the economic significance of sniping. It remains
an open question whether sniping significantly affects auction revenues or the health of an auction platform, and it is
on this last point we contribute to the literature.
There are a number of papers which endeavor to explain
the incentive to snipe. Bajari and Hortaçsu (2003) demonstrated the prevalence of sniping and suggested that if there
is a common-value component to bidders’ valuations, they
would have an incentive to conceal their bids until the end to
avoid revealing information. Roth and Ockenfels (2002) and
Ockenfels and Roth (2002, 2006) compared the soft ending
times of Amazon.com auctions (now defunct) to the hard
ending times at eBay.com, and proposed that sniping is a
rational response to the existence of a potentially small set
of “incremental bidders.” Barbaro and Bracht (2004) highlight the argument that bidders may use sniping as a way to
avoid being squeezed by sellers who use shill bids to narrow
the gap between the second-highest and the latent, highest
bid.
Evidence of the returns to sniping is limited. Ely and Hossain (2009) and Gray and Reiley (2004) both conduct field
experiments. The former find an economically insignificant
payoff to sniping (about 17 cents for a new DVD). They argue that the magnitude of these gains are roughly equal to
the gains of bidding early to signal one’s participation, in an
attempt to deter entry by other bidders. Glover and Raviv
(2012) show that auctions with soft ending times on Yahoo! sell for substantially more than those with hard ending
times, and conjecture that this is attributable to less sniping.
In the public finance literature on charity auctions, Elfenbein and McManus (2010b,a) and Carpenter et al. (2011)
show that sniping has a negative effect on auction revenues.
The former go on to suggest that the “warm glow” of participating in charity auctions may deter bidders from adopting
more aggressive bidding strategies such as late-bidding.

SNIPING

We define late bidding, or sniping, as bidding that happens
in the final seconds of a time-limited auction, so that other
bidders have little, if any, ability to respond with an incremental bid. Figure 2 provides a vivid illustration, where we
have shown the behavior of 4 participants in a 7 day auction
that was won by a sniper.

There are a host of third-party websites which offer sniping
services and software for eBay auctions. Bidders provide
their account login credentials and may pay a small fee to

and the x-axis shows the hours remaining when each bid

are connected by line segments if more than one was made.
There was no reserve for this auction and the starting price
was $4.99 with a Buy It Now (BIN) option of $9.99, and
an increment of 0.50. The first bid of $7 was placed by the
lavender bidder with less than 18 hours left on the clock. He
was the high bidder for most of the remaining time. Around
the 7 hour mark, khaki buyer made a solitary bid of 6, which
was sufficient to raise the price, but not to put him in the
lead. An hour later, red user became the new high bidder
with a bid of $10. In response, lavender bidder raised his
bid to $8.50, though that was not enough to put him back
on top. Red looked to be winning for the next few hours,
even with 5 minutes remaining (first dashed line).9 With 3
seconds to go, a sniper placed a bid of $19.52. He won and
paid 10.50 for this item. We do not know that the red bidder
would have countered, but we do know that he had no time
to respond.
Incremental bidding, or nibbling, as well as ordinary bidrevision, happens fairly frequently on eBay. We find that
bidders place multiple bids (revisions or bid responses) 29
percent of the time. Moreover, 4.4 percent of bidders place
five or more bids in a single auction, which suggests a true
bidding war. Snipers have nibblers to pick off and so there
is some reward to sniping because sniping denies 29 percent
of bidders the opportunity to counter bid.
Figure 3 shows that there is considerable variation in how
prevalent sniping is in various corners of eBay.10 It plots
the fraction of auctions in each meta category that were
won through sniping. Mechanically, that fraction grows as
we change the definition of sniping from bidding in the last
one second to bidding in the last minute. For example, over
have their bid placed in the last seconds of an auction.

a third of cell phone auctions were won in the last second,
but over half were sniped in the last 60 seconds.
Using our preferred 3 second definition, sniped tickets are
over twice as common as with crafts. We note that a rank
order of the categories varies somewhat by definition, but
not substantially.
This confirms that sniping occurs at different rates for different products. In our sample, sniping is more prevalent
in thinner markets, a fact that may confound analysis of its
effects on follow-up behavior. Figure 4 plots the fraction of
sniped auctions by the number of bidders in those auctions
from our sample, which is described in Section 5.
We also see substantial variation in the sniping rate at different times of the day. Sniping, as a percentage of all bids,
peaks in the middle of the night when many bidders are
likely sleeping but automated sniping bots are still active.11
By contrast, manual bids are more likely to happen in the
evening hours when the site is busiest. We will use this
variation in our IV estimation.

EMPIRICAL DESIGN

The ideal experiment to test our conjecture that sniping
drives out buyers from the auction platform would have the
following two features. First, we would want to focus on
a cohort of new eBay users.12 This group is still forming
their expectations about how much surplus they can expect
from the site, and so any effects should be readily apparent. Moreover, all users start out as new, and once buyers
amass experience, it becomes considerably harder to adjust
for that heterogeneity and to deal with the selection issues

caused by attrition. For instance, if sniping-averse buyers
leave eBay, the population of surviving seasoned users may
consider sniping a feature since it allows them to purchase
items at a lower price or because it has some ludic value
for them, even if they are occasionally sniped themselves or
suffer as sellers. On the other hand, this focus on new users
somewhat circumscribes the external validity of the effects
we estimate.
Once we have a population of auctions in which a new buyer
becomes the current high bidder, we can flip a coin to select
a random subset to be treated by being sniped in the last
moment. New users in the control group would be outbid
by us earlier on. Our winning bid for them would be set
high enough that a control buyer who revises his bid upward would never regain his initial top position. For both
groups, at the point of randomization, the auction would
become “hidden” to restrict further entry by new bidders
and “locked” to keep anyone other than the new buyer from
revising his bid. This minimizes substitution bias from control units being treated, but also ensures that we have full
control over the information that is revealed to the losers,13
and over the time that they perceive to be in the lead. This
is the second essential feature.
Once this hypothetical experiment starts, we can follow both
groups for some period of time to track their activity. We
can compare the average number of auction purchases, total
revenue, or merely the proportion who bid in an auction
again. The difference between the two groups in any of
the those metrics would be the treatment effect of being
sniped. Note that we are not comparing winners to losers.
The treatment alters the manner in which a buyer lost, not
whether he did.
The second aspect of this design renders the experiment in-

11

Figure 5 shows this pattern for each time zone.
12
We consider an eBay user to be new if the observed auction
is the first action, bid or purchase, made on the site. We
allow users to have signed up as early as 6 months prior to
our window.

13

For example, if the observed standing price rises for the
control group as more bids are made, the control group will
learn more about by how much they lost than the treatment
losers.

feasible since it is impossible to experimentally control the
dynamics of auctions in the field. Instead we propose the
following exercise. We take a large set of auctions and restrict attention to bidders who are winning with 5 minutes
remaining until the auction closes. For each auction, there
is a single bidder who meets this criterion. We proceed to
exclude all but first-time bidders. We also exclude bidders
who go on to win the auction, out of a concern that sniped
bidders, who necessarily lose, have residual demand for the
product being auctioned. We identify a bidder as sniped if
he is outbid in the last 3 seconds. If he is outbid any earlier
in the last 5 minutes, he is part of the control group. This
allows us to compare outcomes for those losers who could
have potentially responded by bringing their bid closer to
their true reservation value, to those for whom this was impossible. Imagine that we could find another auction that
had the exact same attributes and history of bids, but the
final bid came in between the 2 vertical blue lines, the 5
minute and the 3 second marks in Figure 2. This would
serve as a counterfactual auction for the sniped case, since
the red bidder would have had enough time to respond to a
bid that came in somewhat earlier.
We note that our arbitrary 3 second threshold may misclassify some bidders and cause attenuation bias in the estimated treatment effect. The bidders’ ability to respond
will depend on the quality of their internet connection and
the mode of their connection, whether PC, mobile, or other.
We have chosen 3 seconds because this both fits the visual
presented in Figure 1 and because this is a logical threshold
at which human response time limits the ability to counter
bid. We choose a five minute counterfactual window because
we want to limit the sample to auctions where the bidder
was winning as the auction came to a close. We examine in
the appendix how sensitive our results are to the 3 second
definition of sniping and to the 5 minute window.

5.

SAMPLE CONSTRUCTION

We want to measure the impact of sniping on consumer behavior, so we want to construct a sample of consumers that
are similar in most respects but for the fact that some have
been outbid in the last few seconds of the auction where
there was no chance to respond. To do this we need to find
i) a sample of users that are alike, in expectation, at the
time of the auction and ii) are expected to have similar behavior after the auction but for the sniping. Therefore, we
focus on i) first-time bidders and ii) bidders who lose their
first auction. We identify all first-time bids October 2009
and October of 2011 where the bidder did not win the auction. We chose this period so that we have a full year of
data for all bidders after their first auction. This is over 2
million bidders. We then identify those bidders that were
the winning bidder with exactly five minutes remaining in
the auction. Some of these bidders were winning for only
seconds and some where winning for days, but all were the
winner at the 5 minute mark and eventually lost. Note that
since each auction can have only one winner at a single moment in time, this eliminates any duplicate auctions so that
each bidder-auction pair is unique. In our main specifications, we further limit the sample to bidders that were still
winning with one minute remaining. These bidders where
thus winning for at least four minutes because they were
winning at the five minute mark and the one minute mark.

Finally, in some of our specifications we limit the analysis to
the subsample of auctions that are in thicker markets. To
do this, we first identify those auctions that are identified by
eBay’s product catalog, which are typically items with well
defined manufacturer product codes. This further limits the
sample because only a portion of eBay’s inventory is covered
by the catalog. We then find catalog products with more
than 10 transactions over the two-year period. Table 1 shows
the counts of each sample truncation.

In Table 2, we present summary statistics for our full sample
of auctions with first-time bidders winning at 5 minutes.
Although all the bidders in our sample were outbid, only 7
percent of these auctions were outbid in the last 3 seconds,
10 percent in the last 4 seconds, and so forth. In general,
49 percent of first-time bidders do not bid again in an eBay
auction. We stress that this is auction specific, many eBay
users switch to fixed price listings. We still consider these
users as not returning because we are interested in capturing
an effect associated with a dis-utility of auctions, not the
overall platform. Statistics for additional controls are shown
as well.

ESTIMATION

The principal results are shown graphically in Figure 1,
which shows a marked increase in the probability of not
returning in the last few seconds of the auction. Figure
1 simply plots a locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing of
not returning against minutes remaining when outbid conditional on winning with five minutes remaining in the auction.
To make the suggested results of Figure 1 concrete, we estimate probit regressions assessing the impact of being ‘sniped’,
or outbid by late bidding, on future behavior. Figure 1
demonstrates a distinct jump in the probability of leaving
the platform if outbid in the last few seconds of the auction.
We then regress an indicator for whether the user does not
participate in an eBay auction within 12 months of being
outbid on an indicator for whether or not the time of outbid

was within three seconds of the close of the auction.14 We
limit the regression to all auctions where the new bidder was
still winning with one minute remaining.15
Table 3 presents the probit estimates of marginal effects of
sniped on failure to return from several specifications. Column 1 presents the estimates without any controls and indicates a 3.3 percentage point increase in the probability of
not returning. This confirms that the increase in not returning as outbid time approaches zero shown in Figure 1,
which rises from 48 percent to 51 percent, is a statistically
significant relationship. This estimate is unconditional, and
since sniping is not a random occurrence, there are a variety
of confounders we first try to address with controls.
In Column 2, we add controls for two important selection
mechanisms. First, bidders who are outbid earlier in the
auction are likely to have lower bids simply because lower
bids are more likely to be outbid sooner as bidders arrive.
Bidders that bid lower have different expectations of surplus
from buying on the platform generally and may be more
likely to leave the site once final prices are revealed. Lower
bids could therefore be correlated with the timing of being
outbid and not returning. We include the ratio of the bidder’s (losing) bid to the highest (winning) bid as a control.

A view of the data in Figure 1 suggests a kink in the returntime remaining relationship at three seconds.
15
This limits the sample to all auctions where the new bidder was winning from five minutes to one minute before the
auction. This improves the comparability among bidders:
we are now only comparing losers in the last few seconds to
the last minute.

We also include controls for the timing of the sniped bidders’ bid. Since we condition on the bidder winning at 5
minutes remaining, auctions where bidders had been winning for longer are auctions with less activity and may be
more likely to be sniped because potential bidders are lying in wait. Bidders that bid very early in the auction may
have a different probability of returning. It is not a priori
clear what direction these potential effects would bias the
results, but the coefficient on sniping remains consistent at
3.5 percentage point impact.
From Figure 3 we see that there is some variation in sniping
rates across categories so in Column 3 we include fixed effects for eBay’s 35 top line product meta categories. As was
shown in Figure 3, sniping rates vary across product types
which naturally attract bidders with different propensities
to return. The estimated effect decreases to 1.38 percentage points which hints that cross category effects may bias
the results, but meta category is a very broad classification
that masks important product level variation. So we explore
several methods of controlling for more specific product attributes.
In Column 4, we add an interaction of the sniped indicator
with an indicator for whether the item was listed by a power
seller, eBay’s designation for high volume, high quality sellers. These items are likely to attract bidders looking for
very common items on eBay. It is perhaps not surprising
that being sniped is much less burdensome for these buyers
because there is a greater likelihood that they will try again.
In Columns 5 and 6, we limit the sample to auctions for

items that are in ‘thick’ markets: the item is identified in
eBay’s product catalog and has more than 10 auctions in
our full 2 year sample. These auctions are likely to be very
similar to each and most reduce all selection effects related
to product characteristics. We replace the bid-to-highestbid ratio with the ratio of the bid to the expected price for
that product (average final price of the product), which is a
better proxy for bid’s seriousness. Column 5 shows that the
estimate is not significantly different from the estimates in
Column 3. The estimate loses significance only because we
have a lower sample size. In Column 6, we estimate a probit
model with product level random effects and notice that the
coefficient rises to 3.8 percentage points.

We are concerned about the endogeneity of sniping selection
and return rates, but the sign of the bias is not obvious. The
returns from sniping would be higher in thinner markets,
where incremental bidders are less likely to be bid up by
non-sniping but rational bidders. And these thinner markets
are more prevalent on eBay so bidders in these markets are
more likely to return. Thus, the positive shock to sniping
would be a negative shock to exit rates and would bias our
estimates downward. Column 6 supports this view because
removing much of that bias by focusing on within product
variation in sniping increases the coefficient.

zone, an assumption supported by eBay’s national presence.
Table 4: Bivariate Probit Estimates
(1)

In order to more fully address the selection endogeneity, we
leverage an instrumental variables strategy that relies on the
fact that auctions on eBay are national events but that sniping is a function of the number of bidders on the site in the
last few minutes of the auction. We want an instrument that
shifts the probability of being outbid in the last few seconds,
as opposed to being outbid in the last few minutes. Auctions
that have more rational, non-sniping bidders watching the
close are less likely be sniped because the first-time bidder
will be outbid in a way that allows them to respond. We
also need this instrument to be correlated with the probability of a bidder returning to the platform only through the
probability of being sniping.
Auctions end on eBay simultaneously across the country and
therefore at different local times of day depending on the
time zone of the bidder. We found that the probability of
being sniped varies dramatically by the closing time of the
auction because the number of users browsing the site varies
dramatically by time of day. When there are fewer users
on the site, there are fewer non-incremental, non-sniping
bidders to drive up the auction price earlier in the auction.
This creates a cyclical relationship between the proportion
of auctions that are sniped and the time of day. We show
in Figure 5 that this relationship actually varies by time
zone. We plot a dummy for being sniped against the local
auction end time for the first-time bidder for the auctions in
our sample and then fit a local polynomial. As is evident, a
bidder on the West Coast watching an auction at midnight
has almost a 15 percent chance of being sniped but the same
bidder on the east coast has only a roughly 8 percent chance
of being sniped. This is because midnight on the east coast
is still prime time on the west coast and there are more nonsniping rational bidders in the auction. Thus, two bidders
bidding at midnight have a different chance of being sniped
and their only difference is time zone. We assume that the
probability of returning is otherwise uncorrelated with time

To implement this instrument, we utilize a bivariate probit
regression with local time of day and server time of day
dummies.16 We use the server time dummies as the excluded
instruments which are uncorrelated with churn, conditional
on the local time of day.
Table 4 presents the marginal effects and average treatment
effects estimates.17 Columns 2 and 3 add category dummies
and the hours remaining controls used before. Columns 4
restricts the sample to power seller listings and first-time
bidders still winning at one minute.
The estimates are much larger than the probit results but
are in line with the random effects estimate. In our most restrictive sample shown in Column 4, the ATE and ATT are

about 18 percentage points. This demonstrates, at the very
least, that the 3 percent estimates are biased downward and
that the true effect is substantial. Taken together, the evidence bolsters the claim that being sniped has large effects
users’ propensity to participate in future auctions.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

There is strong evidence that being sniped is an experience
which discourages new bidders from returning to bid again.
We find a sizeable effect in our probit specifications, which
we believe to be biased downward, and a much larger effect
when we use bidder time zones to instrument for the likelihood of being sniped. These findings are consistent with the
story advanced in Roth and Ockenfels (2002) that sniping is
a rational response to the presence of incremental bidders.
The effect is economically significant from the perspective of
an auction platform. Even small changes in the rate at which
new participants join the platform can have a tremendous
effect on long-term platform size.
The recent surge in availability of e-commerce data is a
unique opportunity to re-examine hypotheses that had been
formerly pursued using only scraped, field experiment, or lab
experiment data. The advantage of using data directly from
the e-commerce platform is that it is so extensive that we
are able to narrow our empirical strategy to a subset of comparable auctions in order to identify the effects of interest,
while still enjoying a wealth of data. We believe that this
development offers researchers the opportunity to rigorously
test theory where before we could have been little more than
suggestive, and that this is an important direction for new
work.

APPENDIX
A. ROBUSTNESS
A.1 Window
The probit results in Table 3 use a sample of auctions where
the first-time bidder was winning at 5 minutes and still winning with 1 minute remaining. In Table 5 we present estimates from samples with different control windows. The
estimates from Column 3 are those presented in Column 3
of Table 3. In Columns 1 and 2, we narrow the sample to
auctions where the first-time bidder was outbid in 6 and 10
seconds. Column 1 shows that there is still a 1.1 percentage
point increase in the probability of not returning for bidders who are outbid with less than 3 seconds left compared
to those outbid between 3 and 6 seconds. This is slightly
smaller than the other windows, which confirms the relationship shown in Figure 1. Conversely, Columns 4 and 5
show that there is actually very little effect of adding auctions where the outbidding occurs early in the auction.

A.2

Snipe Definition

Table 6 presents probit results for increasingly expansive definitions of sniping, from 6 seconds to almost 5 minutes (300
seconds). When we vary the sniping definition even a little,
the estimates are negative suggesting that the up-tick in exit
is only present for those auctions where the first-time bidder
actually did not have time to respond. The fact that these
probit results are negative is at first alarming, but actually
consistent with the instrumental variable motivation.

A.3

Linear Probability Model

We use a probit model in our primary specifications but we
can easily estimate a linear probability model for robustness. Table 7 presents the results from Table 3 with a linear
model. The estimates are qualitatively similar. To check the
robustness of the downward bias on exit from product selection, we leverage the time zone instrument with two stage
least squares estimation of the linear model. Here the estimates are substantially larger, so large that we believe the
linear model for the binary outcome is not well behaved. We
interpret these results as consistent with the probit results
because the negative bias persists and simple OLS estimates
are similar to the base probit models. The bivariate probit
is a more appropriate model given that both the dependent
and independent variables are binary.
