    "abstract": "\n\nLatin American portfolio inflows show a strong tendency to revert to a natural level, KF*, over medium-run horizons. Deviations of actual flows from KF* provide policymakers with a real-time predictor of future flows, sudden stops and vulnerability to global shocks. Analysis of short-run deviations of flows from KF* reveals heterogeneous drivers: commodity prices for Brazil, Chile, and Mexico; risk tolerance for Argentina, Costa Rica, and Peru.\n\n",
