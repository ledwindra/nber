DO TEACHERS' RACE, GENDER,
AND ETHNICITY MAITER?:
EVIDENCE FROM NELS88

ABSTRACT

Our study uses a unique national longitudinal survey, the National Educational
Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS), which permits researchers to match individual students and
teachers, to analyze issues relating to how a teacher's race, gender, and ethnicity, per Se,
influence students from both the same and different race, gender, and ethnic groups. In contrast

to much of the previous literature, we focus both on how teachers subjectively relate to and
evaluate their students
on objectively how much their students learn.
On balance, we find that teachers' race, gender, and ethnicity, per se, are much more
likely to influence teachers' subjective evaluations of their students than they are to influence

how much the students objectively learn. For example, while white female teachers do not

appear to be associated with larger increases in test scores for white female students in
mathematics and science than white male teachers "produce", white female teachers do have
higher subjective evaluations than their white male counterparts of their white female students.
We relate our findings to the more general literature on gender, race, and ethnic bias in subjective

performance evaluations in the world of work and trace their implications for educational and
labor markets.

I. INTRODUCTION
Why should public school systems aggressively pursue policies to recruit and retain

teachers from underrepresented groups? In part, these policies derive from distributionai
considerations and the desire to provide employment opportunities for members ofgroups
that have been historically discriminated against. More importantly, they are motivated by

the poor academic performance and high drop-out rates ofmany minority students vis-a-vis

their white counterparts and the belief by many that teachers from underrepresented
minority groups are more effective teachers of minority students. The latter is thought to
occur because minority teachers may serve as role models for minority students, interact

better with them, have more favorable attitudes and higher expectations for them, and
provide more positive feedback to them.1

Research on the relative effectiveness of minority teachers in educating minority

students has been conducted primarily by sociologists, psychologists, and educational
researchers and has focused on teachers' attitudes towards, expectations for, and placement

of minority students, as well as the feedback that they provide to the students.2 Most do

not address the students' educational outcomes and also fail to control for other teacher
characteristics, such as verbal ability, experience and degree levels.3 They also fail to ask

about the effects that underrepresented minority teachers have on non-minority students.

Females are underrepresented in many scientific and engineering fields at the
collegiate level, both as students and faculty.4 A major reason for this is that by the time
females reach the ends of their high school careers, they perform, on average, poorer than
males in many science and mathematics classes and on standardized tests.5 Many decry the
absence of female role models in science and mathematics as part of the explanation for this

2
Outcome and call for increased efforts to recruit and retain female high school mathematics

and science teachers. However, empirical research on the role that teacher gender actually

plays again typically focuses on attitudinal types of measures and not educational
outcomes.' The few studies that do address outcomes focus on the correlation between
teacher gender and students' test scores at a point in time, rather than on the correlation
between teacher gender and some value added measure.7

Our study uses a unique national longitudinal survey, the National Educational
Longitudinal Study of of 2988 (NELS) to analyze issues relating to how a teacher's race,

gender, and ethnicity influence students from both the same race, gender, and ethnicity
group and students from other groups. In contrast to much of the previous literature, we

focus both on how teachers subjectively relate to and evaluate their students

on

objectively how much their students learn.

After discussing the unique nature of the NELS data in the next section, section HI
presents our empirical results. On balance, we find that teachers' race, gender, and ethnicity
are much more likely to influence teachers' subjective evaluations of their students than they

are to influence how much their students objectively learn. A final section relates our

findings to the more general literature on gender, race, and ethnic bias in subjective
performance evaluations and traces through the implications of our findings for future
research on both education and labor markets.

IL ThE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL LONGITUDINAL STUDY (NELS)
The National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS) is a unique national
data base. Its initial survey wave was conducted between Februaiy 1 and June 30 of 1988

when students were enrolled in the 8th grade. Data were gathered from students, parents,
teachers, and school administrators. For each student, two subject areas were chosen from
among English/reading, mathematics, science, and histozy/social studies. The student was

then administered a cognitive test in these two areas jj the student's teachers in these two
areas surveyed. NELS thus permits one to directly link data on each 8th grade student with

data on two of his or her teachers, as well as data from his or her parents and school
administrator. The initial wave of NELS included responses from 24,599 students, 22,651
parents, and 5,193 teachers at 1,035 schools.

A second wave of NELS was conducted between January 26 and June 30 of 1990,

when the vast majority of the initial cohort of students were enrolled in the 10th grade.9
Once again, two subjects, typically the same as in 1988, were chosen for each student and

the student was administered cognitive tests in these areas. The student's current teacher
in these two subjects were again surveyed, as were school administrators; however, parents

were not surveyed in 1990. The second wave of NELS included responses from 18,221
students, 15,908 teachers, and 1,291 school administrators.

The cognitive tests administered to the students each year were developed by the
Educational Testing Service. The number of questions varied across tests, ranging from 21

in reading comprehension and 25 in science to 30 in history/social studies and 40 in

mathematics. While all students who took a subject area test in the 8th grade were

4
administered the same test, six versions of the tests, which differed in their mathematics arid

reading difficulty levels, were administered in the 10th grade. Each student's 10th grade
tests were determined by his or her scores on the base year mathematics and reading tests.

The purpose of the multi-level design of the 10th grade test was to guard against "ceiiing
and "floor" effects that might otherwise have occurred.

In the next section, we estimate gain score equations to ascertain whether teachers'

race, gender and ethnicity per Se, influence how much their students learn.. Because
different students were administered different tests in the 10th grade, which differed in their

degree of difficulty, unadjusted gain scores can .flQj be used for this purpose. Fortunately,

these different tests were made comparable by the designers of NELS through the use of
Item Response Theory (11R1). jR]: is a method that uses the pattern of right, wrong, and
omitted responses to the questions actually administered on each test, and the difficulty,
discriminating ability, and "guessabi1ity of each question, to place each student, regardless
of the test he or she was administered on a continuous scale.1° The gain scores we actually

use in our analyses are the difference between a student's 10th grade test JET estimated

number right and the student's rescaled JJj estimated number right on the 8th grade
test.1'

We also ascertain in this section whether a teacher's subjective evaluation of a
student depends upon the match between the student's and the teacher's race, gender, and

ethnicity. Teachers in the 10th grade survey were asked a set of questions about their
perceptions of each surveyed student in their class. These included whether they thought

the student would probably go to college, would recommend the student for academic

5
honors, believed the student relates well to others, spoke to the students outside of class,

and believed the student works bard. These responses (1=yes, O=no for each) were
aggregated by us into a single teacher's subjective evaluation variable and this variable used

in our analyses.

ifi. EMPIRICAL ANALYSES
A) Gain Score Analyses

Our analyses of students' gain scores for each subject area are restricted to white,
black, and Hispanic students enrolled in public schools in both the 8th and the 10th grades
who took the subject area tests in both years, and for whom teacher characteristics (in both
years), school variables (in the 10th grade), and parental survey responses (in the 8th grade)

were all present. These restrictions reduced the number of observations in our analyses to
1,776 in history, 2,848 in reading, 3,029 in mathematics, and 2,445 in science.

Table la presents the mean values of the 8th grade subject area test scores (number

of correct answers) for these students, stratified by race, gender, arid ethnicity. Since the
number of questions on the tests varied across subject areas, comparisons of absolute scores

across tests are not very useful. These data do suggest, however, that white students Out-

performed other students, on average, on all four tests, and that male students in each
racial/ethnic group slightly out-performed female students in the group on the mathematics

test and under-performed female students on the reading test.
Table lb presents the mean adjusted (as described above) gain scores on each test

between the 8th and 10th grades for students in each demographic group. These means

6

range across groups from roughly I to 2.8 in science, 1.8 to 23 in reading, 2.2 to 3.2 in
h.istoiy, and 4.6 to 5.1 in mathematics. These mean gain scores should be kept in mind
when one evaluates the estimates of the importance of teacher race, gender, and ethnicity

per se that appear below.
Table 2 presents data for each race/gender/ethnic group of 10th grade students and
each of the four subject matter areas, on how the students were distributed across teachers

of different race, genders, and ethnicities. Across groups of students and subject matter

areas, between 74 and 97 percent of the teachers are white. White students almost
exclusively have white teachers in the sample. Numerous male and female teachers appear

for all groups of students in all four subject areas. Finally, while black and Hispanic
students have primarily white teachers, occasionally over 10 percent of the students from

these groups have teachers in a subject matter area from a particular underrepresented
minority group. For example, 11 percent of black history students had black male teachers
in the sample. Similarly, 16 percent of black male English students and 21 percent of black

female English students had black female teachers in the sample.

Small sample sizes and cells in which very few teachers from a group are present
make it a priori unlikely that we will observe statistically significant effects.'3 Hence, our
prior's are that we will be much more likely to estimate the impact of white female vis-s-vis

white male teachers on each student group, then we will be able to estimate the impacts of

black and Hispanic teachers on these groups. In cases where a relatively large proportion

of minority teachers were present, however, such as the three noted above, statistically
significant effects might also be expected to be observed.

7

Our analytical approach is to estimate for each racial/gender/ethnic group of
students and each of the four subject areas in which the tests were given, gain score
equations of the form

(1)

-

a0

+

aX aS + akTk + E bdk +

In equation (1), the subscript

i

indexes individuais, the subscript

j

racial/gender/ethnic groups of students (6), and the subscript k subject matter areas (4).
Gt is the student's 10th grade adjusted subject test score and 01.1 the student's 8th grade

adjusted score. The X's, S's, and 'l's are vectors of variables that control respectively for
personal and family characteristics, school level variables for the student's high school, and
characteristics of the 10th grade subject teacher and subject class, a1, a2, and a3 are vectors

of parameters and c is a random error term.
The personal and family variables included in our actual empirical analysis are
parents' education levels, family size, family income, the student's base year 8th grade
adjusted test score, and whether the student was learning disabled or had limited English
proficiency. The school level variables included are total enrollment, the percentage of the

school's graduates who enroll in college, the racial distribution of the student body, the
percentage of teachers with at least a master's degree, and the highest salary paid to fullthne teachers in the school. Finaily, the class and teacher variables included are the number
of students and the proportion of these that were minority in the student's subject area class,

as well as the subject teacher's years of experience, degree level, certification in the subject

8

and subject matter background. Control variables of these types are often found in prior
"educational production function" studies.14

Of key concern to us is whether teacher race, gender, and ethnicity per se influence

how much students learn. So, included in (1) also is a vector of dichotomous variables, d,

that indicate whether the student's 10th grade subject matter teacher was a black male,
black female, Hispanic male, Hispanic female, other (primarily Asian American) male, other

female or white female. The omitted category of teachers is white male, so the coefficients
(b) of these variables reflect the impact of each group of teachers on the students' adjusted
gain scores vis-a-vis the impact of white male teachers.

The gain scores refer to students' improvement in their academic performance that

occurred depending upon when the two tests were adrninictered, sometime between
February and June of their 8th grade year and February and June of their 10th grade year.

To the extent that teacher characteristics influence student gain scores, the characteristics
of the students' 9th grade subject teachers should also be included in the analyses. Similarly,

the characteristics of the 8th grade subject area teachers should also be included, both
because the 8th grade test was administered to many of the students before the end of the
year (which provided time for many 8th grade teachers to influence how much the students

learned after the test that year) and because they may also have influenced their students'
interest in, and motivation for, future study in the subject area.
No data on the characteristics of 9th grade teachers were collected in NELS. Hence,

9th grade teachers' characteristics could not be included in equation (1) and this omission

9

may bias our estimates. We report below the results of our attempts to include 8th grade

teacher characteristics in the model.

Estimates of the coefficients for the teacher racial/gender/ethnicity dichotomous
variables appear in Table 3 for each race, gender, and ethnic group of students by subject

area. Coefficients of the control variables, when statistically significant, were typically
similar in sign to those found in other studies.'5
Turning to table 3, for only 11 (out of 130) of these coefficients can we reject the
hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero at the .10 level of significance or above, and

thus conclude that teacher race, gender, and ethnicity per se may influence gain scores.
Indeed, for only one of the 24 race/gender/ethnicity/subject matter groups, Hispanic female

science students, can one reject at the .05 level of significance the null hypotheses that all

of the teacher race/gender/ethnicity variables have no effect on students' gain scores.
Together this is strong evidence that, on balance, teacher's race, gender, and ethnicity per

se do .ns play an important role in how much students learn in this sample.
The pattern of the small number of statistically significant coefficients does warrant

mention, in comparison to white male teachers, black male teachers are associated with
higher history gain scores for black male, white male and white female students, but lower

reading scores for Hispanic male students. Black female science teachers are associated
with higher science scores for Hispanic female and white female science

White

female teachers are associated with lower reading and history scores for Hispanic male
students, but higher science scores for Hispanic female students. Finally, quite strikingly,

there is no evidence that, as compared to white male teachers, white female teachers

10

increase, or decrease, the scores of either white male or white female students in any
subject. Given the large sample sizes for white students and white teachers in our analyses,

our failure to find significant effects of teacher gender here can

be attributed to small

samples.

Several extensions warrant brief mention. Use of a smaller number of dichotomous

variables in which gender was not interacted with race or ethnicity (black, Hispanic, other

race, female) did not lead to a larger number of statistically significant effects. When the
race, gender, and ethnicity of the students' 8th grade subject matter teacher was added to

the model, the coefficients of these variables never proved to be jointly statistically
significant. Finally, adding dichotomous variables that represented the race, gender, and
ethnicity of the student's second observed 10th grade subject area teacher did not improve

the fit of the model.

Together these results provide, at best, little support for the notion that teachers'
race, gender, and ethnicity per se influence how much students objectively learn. Indeed,
in only one case, black male history teachers and students, do we find any evidence that the

match of teacher and student gender and race or ethnicity ezthances the students' gain
scores.
B) Subiective Teacher Evaluations
How can our findings be reconciled with those studies cited earlier that purported

to show that teachers' attitudes towards, expectations for, placement of, and feedback to
students depends upon the match of teacher and student race, gender, and ethnicity? One

11

strategy is to ask a related question, do such relationships exist in the NELS data, where our

findings suggest that such matches do .n influence how much students objectively learn?
To answer the latter question, we reestimated variants of equation (1) in which the

student's gain score was replaced by a variable that summarizes the student's 10th grade
subject teacher's evaluation of the student.'7 This variable was constructed as the sum of

a set of five yes (= 1), no (= 0) answers to whether the teacher thought the student would

go to college, would recommend the student for academic honors, believed the student
related weU to others, spoke to the student out of class, and believed the student worked
hard.

Table 4 shows the mean teacher evaluations of the students by subject area, on a
scale of 0 to 5. Female students of each race and ethnicity are rated more highly than male

students of the same race and ethnicity in each subject matter area. Hispanic and black
students are rated about the same in each subject matter, however, white students tend to

be rated higher than the other two groups. Whether this difference reflects differences in
background characteristics (the control variables) or different subjective evaluations of a
teaching staff that is predominantly white (see Table 2) will be learned from the variants

of equation (1) that we reestimated.

Table S presents the estimated coefficients of the dichotomous variables for the
subject matter teacher's race, gender, and ethnicity from these equations. Quite strikingly
23 of these coefficients are now statistically significantly different from zero, over twice the

number observed to be so in the gain score equations. Moreover, the match of teacher and

student race or ethnicity often is associated with teachers having higher subjective

12

evaluations of the students. For example, as compared to white male teachers, black male

teachers are associated with significantly higher subjective evaluations for black male
students in reading and science and for black female students in mathematics and science.

Hispanic teachers of either gender are associated with significantly higher subjective
evaluations for Hispanic students of either gender in mathematics. Finally, white female
teachers are associated with significantly higher subjective evaluations for white female
students in reading, mathematics, and science and for white male students in reading and
science, but lower evaluations for white male students in history.

We experimented with several alternative specifications. Since the subjective
evaluation variable can only take integer values between 0 and 5 for each individual, the
linear model we estimated is not strictly appropriate and a multinomial probit model was

also estimated. Since the first two subjective evaluation questions included in our in our

index (did the teacher believe the student would attend college and did the teacher
recommend the student for academic honors?) are probably conceptually, and canonical

correlation analysis suggest also empirically, more important than the others, we also

reestiinated separate least squares and probit equations for the (1,0) answers to these
questions, as well as ordered probit models for the sum of the answers to these two more
important questions.'8 In each case the results were qualitatively similar to those reported

in Table 5, although somewhat fewer significant coefficients emerged in some of these
specifications.

13

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Do teachers' race, gender, and ethnicity matter? Our analyses of the NELS data
suggest that for the most part these teacher characteristics do.flQj affect how much students

learned between the 8th and 10th grade in four subject matter areas. They do, however,
sometimes seem to influence 10th grade teachers' subjective evaluations of their students,
even after one controls for the student's subject matter test scores in the 8th grade. So, for
example, while white female teachers doIlQj appear to be associated with higher gain scores

for white female students in mathematics and science than white male teachers produce,

white female teachers do have higher subjective evaluations than their white male
counterparts of their white female students.
These findings are subject to a number of qualifIcations that were imposed upon us
by the NELS data. No information was available in the data about the characteristics of 9th

grade teacher, no measures of teacher ability were present, and teacher and school
characteristics had to be treated as pre-determined.19 However, if one takes our findings
at face value, there are two conflicting ways in which one might interpret them.

On the one hand, one might argue that what is crucial is how much students learn
in classrooms, in which case one might conclude that teacher race, gender, and ethnicity per

se do not matter. On the other hand, one might argue that teachers' subjective evaluations

of students may be reflected in the encouragement they provide these students and the
tracks on which they place the students or to which they encourage them to aspire. If the

latter view is correct, our results suggest that in some cases teachers' race, gender, and
ethnicity do matter.

14

Resolving which interpretation is correct must await the release of subsequent waves

of NELSS8. In particular, students were resurveyed during the first hail of 1992 when they

either were seniors in high school or had dropped out of school. When released, these data
will allow us to test whether the 10th grade teachers' subjective evaluations of their students
influenced how much these students learned between the 10th and 12th grades and the types

of classes in which these students were placed, all conditional on the students' 10th grade

test scores. They also will allow us to estimate the role that teachers' race, gender, and
ethnicity per se play in students' drop-out decisions. Later years NELS data will permit us
to analyze teacher affects on actual college going behavior.
It is interesting to speculate about the implications of our findings for whether it is

important to match employees and supervisors by race, gender, or ethnicity in the
employment relationship? Suppose that one thinks of employees as being analogous to
students and supervisors as being analogous to teachers. Similar to our results, an extensive

literature in the field of human resources shows that gender, racial, or ethnic differences
often exist in supervisor subjective performance evaluations.
However, as in the education case, there is virtually no evidence on whether a match
of supervisors and employees by race, gender, and ethnicity objectively influences how well

employees perform. Similarly there is no evidence on whether the match, or lack of such,
between supervisor and employee characteristics influences an employee's long-run earnings

and productivity at a firm. Research addressing these issues should be high on the priority

list of those concerned with the progress of women and minorities in the labor market.2'

11. All students took the same test in the base year. However, the base year test scores

also bad to be resealed because the questions on the base year test differed in their degree

16

of difficulty, discriminating ability and guessability. Thus, two test takers with the same
number of correct answers, but different questions incorrect, may have different adjusted
base year scores.
12. Since each student was tested in two areas, over 5,000 students were included in the

analyses. Approximately 75 percent of the NELS students were in public schools in both

years which reduced the original NELS sample to about 13,000 students. The remaining
reductions came from missing responses on individual questions from the school, teacher,
or student surveys in the 10th grade and from the parent, teacher, or student surveys in the
8th grade, as well as from students being tested in a subject in 10th grade only if they were

enrolled in a course in that subject.
13. The estimated variance of a dichotomous variable in a regression equation is given

by SJ(NS(1-R)) where N is the sample size, S is the variance of the error term in
the equation, S is the variance of the dichotomous variable (which will be small if the
variable rarely takes on the value of one), and R. is the proportion of the variation in the
dichotomous variable that can be "explained by the other variables in the model. See Hugh

Pitcher (1979) for an elaboration of this point.

for example, Eric Hanusbek (1986).

15. A table of representative results is available from the authors on request.

16. As Table 2 indicates, only one black female teacher taught a Hispanic female
ithence student in the sample. This fact, plus the large magnitude of the estimated impact
of this pairing on the student's gain score (over 5), suggests that the estimated coefficient
may also be capturing the impact of other omitted factors associated with the pairing. Other

17

impacts of this magnitude are observed for black teachers, but in each case that they
occurred they were based on at least seven teacher/student observations.

17. Eighth grade teachers in the NELS survey were not asked to provide these
subjective evaluations.

18. Should our variable be calculated as an unweighted sum of the scores on the
individual teacher subjective evaluation questions? One way to address this question is to

ask what linear combination of the scores on the five evaluation questions is most highly
correlated with a linear combination of the variables on the right-hand side of equation (1).

This is what the method of canonical correlation does, although a weakness of the method

is that one can not perform tests of statistical significance for coefficients of individual

variables using it.

When we employed this method, using data from the various

race/gender/ethnicity/subject area groups, the weights placed on the first two subjective
evaluation variables were typically close to one and the weights placed on the remaining

three subjective evaluation variables were typically much smaller. For a discussion of
canonical correlation analysis, see Bruce Thompson (1984).

19. Ehrenberg and Brewer's (1993) reanalysis of the Coleman Report data make use

of teacher ability measures and tests whether treating school and teacher characteristics
(including teacher race) influences their findings. The lack of geographic identifiers in the

NELS data set preclude similar analyses here.

'The subjective evaluation is the sum of yes (=1), no (.0) responses by the
teachers to the following five questions: Did the teacher
1. think the student would probably go to college?
2. recommend the student for academic honors (i.e.,either honors classes or
recognition)?
3. think the student relates well to others?
4. peak to the students outside of class?
5. think the student works hard?
