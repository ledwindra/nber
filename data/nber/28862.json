    "abstract": "\n\nThe continuing drug overdose crisis in the U.S. has highlighted the urgent need for greater access to treatment.  This paper examines the impact of openings and closings of substance abuse treatment facilities in New Jersey on emergency room visits for substance abuse issues among nearby residents.  We find that drug-related ER visits increase by 16.6% after a facility closure and decrease by 9.5% after an opening.  The effects are largest in relatively under-served areas, among Black residents, and among males.  They are smaller for the middle aged than for either younger or older people.   The results suggest that expanding access to treatment results in significant reductions in morbidity related to drug abuse.\n\n",
