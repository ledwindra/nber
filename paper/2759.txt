INTRODUCTION

Opinion polls show that American voters are well aware of the Federal
budget deficit, and disapprove of it.

However, there are clear indications

that it is politically very difficult to reach an agreement about how to
balance the budget. In particular, several polls show that even though voters
dislike deficits, they are not in favor of any specific measure which would
reduce them.1
Two explanations for this apparent inconsistency of opinions are commonly
proposed.

One is that voters do not understand the concept of budget

constraint, and suffer from "fiscal illusion'.

However, it is quite difficult

to reconcile this notion with the standard assumption of individual
rationality.2

The other is that disagreement amongst voters generates cycling

and prevents the existence of a stable majority.

As a result, individual

consistent way, and no action can be taken to balance the budget.
this argument fails to explain why the absence of a stable political
equilibrium should result in a budget deficit, rather than in a surplus or a
balanced budget: in principle,

it seems than any outcome could be observed if

the political equilibrium is indeterminate.

This paper provides an alternative explanation of budget deficits which
not
is
based on either individual irrationality or non existence of
equilibrium.

The central ingredient of our explanation is the inability of

current voters to bind the choices of future voters.

This inability, coupled

with potential disagreement between the current and future majorities,
introduces a time inconsistency in the dynamic social choice problem that
determines the size of budget deficits: the policies desired by the current
majority would not be carried out if future majorities exhibit different
preferences. The awareness of this possibility may induce the current
majority to run a budget deficit in excess of what would be ex—ante optimal
for society as a whole. This explains why it is hard to agree on how to
eliminate deficits, even if there is a consensus that they may be socially
sub—optimal.
Our results have a simple economic intuition.

Consider a rational voter

who is presented with a number of options on how to allocate the budget
amongst alternative uses.

Suppose further that he is uncertain about how

The paper also shows that, in this model, a balanced—budget is the ex—
ante optimal policy. That is, if the size of the deficit is chosen behind a
"veil of ignorance" on how the debt proceeds are spent, then the voters are
sufficiently high.

This implies that current voters

THE

MODEL

A group of heterogeneous individuals has to decide by majority rule on
the production of two kinds of public goods, g and f. The group is endowed
with one unit of output in each period, and it can borrow or lend to the rest
of the world at a given real interest rate, for notational simplicity taken to
be 0. The world lasts two periods, and all debt outstanding has to be repaid
in full at the end of the second period.

Finally, the upwards sloping lines EP1 and EP2 denote the income

Thus,

decreasing absolute risk aversion implies that the divergence between the

The ambiguity in the sign of b* for 1>m>O is due to the opposite
influence of the two following countervailing forces. By running a surplus
(by setting b<O), the median voter in period 1 moves A to the left along EP
and B to the right along EP2; this has the effect of reducing the distance
between the indifference curves labeled I and II. Hence, setting b<O "buys
insurance" for the median voter of period

1,

in the sense that it tends to

equalize the level of utility in the two periods.

This is the force that works

in the direction of making b<0 more desirable.

On the other hand, by running a deficit (by setting b>O), the median
voter of period 1 moves B to the left along EP2. Since the slopes of EP1 and

It is worth noting that,

in a sense, (1) is the limit case of case (ii);

if the future median voter is at a corner, then its income expansion path
coincides with either the vertical or the horizontal axis.

With reference to

Figure 2, then, leaving some debt to the future has always the effect of
moving the future composition of public spending in the desired direction, as
in the less extreme case (ii).

3.4 Positive Implications
Propositions 1—3 relate the size of budget deficits to the instability of
the median voter's preferences over time.

This type of instability depends

upon the distribution of individual preferences within society.

In the

remainder of this section we show that, the more "homnogenous" are the
preferences of different individuals, ceteris paribus the more stable are the

median voter preferences over time.

This is the sense

in which a more polarized distribution of societies preferences (such as in

These considerations are suggestive of an empirically testable
interpretation for the results of Propositions 1-3.

Thus, such an amendment can be approved only if it

However, a budget amendment taking effect
at some prespecified future date would be irrelevant: if one needs only a
simple majority to abrogate the rule, then any future majority would follow
the policy described in Section 3 and would abrogate the amendment. Using
again the terminology of Holmstrom—Myerson (1983), we can conclude that a

balanced budget amendment, though ex-ante efficient, is not "durable" under
majority rule.

This problem could be overcome by requiring a qualified majority to
abrogate the amendment. But this requirement would eliminate the flexibility
that may be needed to respond to Lnexpected and exceptional events.
Obviously, a budget rule could be contingent on prespeoified events, such as
cyclical fluctuations of tax revenues or "wars."

However, since it is very

diffioult, or even impossible, to list all the relevant contingencies, it
might be desirable to retain some degree of flexibility. Thus, requiring a
very iarge majority to abandon (even ;emporarily) the budget balance
constraint may be counterproductive.
These normative

results may contribute to explain the empirical

observation that the majority of voters seems to generally favor an abstraot

notion of balanced budgets, even though when choosing specific policies it
votes in favor of budget deficits (see the literature quoted in footnote 1).
Balance budgets are ex-ante efficient.

Therefore, the majority of voters,

asked in a poll if they would like a balanced budget constitutional amendment,
would answer "yes."

However the same majority of voters may choose to run a

budget deficit in the current period, if uncertain about the preferences of
future majorities.
More generally, these results suggest the desirability of institutions
that would enable society to separate its intertemporal choices from decisions

concerning the allocation of resources within any given period.
such institutions, there seems to be an inescapable conflict between the goal
of preserving sufficient flexibility to meet unexpected contingencies, and the
oonstraints imposed by the requirement of enforcing this separation.

SUMMARY AND EXTENSIONS

This paper shows that disagreement between current and future voters
about the composition of public expenditure generates a suboptimal path
public debt.

of'

Public debt becomes the legacy left by today's voters to the

future, so as to influence the choices of future voters.

This legacy tends to

increase with the likelihood of disagreement between current and future
voters.

Thus, this paper establishes a precise link between political

polarization and budget deficits.

Political polarization can be interpreted

as a situation where the preferences of future majorities can be very
different from the preferences of today's majority.

This can occur if a

government with extreme preferences (relative to the historical average) wins
the temporary support of a majority of the voters.

Alternatively, it can

occur in political systems where parties with very different preferences are
equally likely to obtain a majority.
in principle

Thus, the implications of this paper are

testable against either time series or cross sectional data.

Perhaps the most natural empirical work along these lines would be a cross
sectional comparison of the deficit policies of countries governed by
different political

institutions and with different degrees of political

conflict.
The model presented in this paper can be generalized in several
directions.

First of all, the restriction to only two types of public goods

is made only for simplicity. Enlarging the set of public goods presents only
one difficulty: it implies an increase of the dimensionality of the parameter
space over which different voters disagree. This complicates the description

of the collective decision problem.

However, this difficulty can be overcome

by either imposing special assumptions on the distribution of voters over this
larger dimensional space -— for instance by assuming the existence of' a
as in Davis—Degroot—Hinich (1972); or by requiring
a super—majority vote to change the status-quo, as in Caplin-alebuff
(1988). Under either of these assumptions, the results of the previous
"median—in—all—directions",

sections could be extended to the case of more than two public goods.
Secondly, the model could be extended to the infinite horizon, by
applying the dynamic programming solution procedure presented in Alesina—
Tabellini

(1987a).

In an infinite horizon model one could also study the

possibility of cooperation between current and future median voters, for

Some recent

interesting literature has investigated the idea that reputational mechanisms
create incentives in favor of honoring the internal debt obligations of
previous governments (see in particular Grossman—Van Huyck (1987a)).16 The
political economy approach of this paper suggests a second line of attack:
domestic debt repudiation may not be politically viable, because it would be
strenuously opposed by the private sector holders of the debt. Recent
accounts of historical episodes of debt repayments in Europe during the

period lend support to this view (see for instance Alesina
(1988b)). Further investigation of this line of thought sets an exciting task

suboptimal budget deficits may be observed before elections if voters

are rational but imperfectly informed. This mechanism can explain short
budget cycles around elections, but it cannot explain long lasting and
large budget deficits which go well beyond the electoral cycle.
