    "abstract": "\n\nThe article identifies the key assumptions that underlie competing theories of the incidence of the local property tax. We conclude that the\"benefit view\" which maintains that the property tax system is equivalent to a set of non-distortionary user changes is correct only under very restrictive assumptions. Only when communities adopt a set of exact, binding zoning requirements will a distortionary tax be transformed into a lump-sum tax. We argue that within jurisdiction heterogeneity of house and firm typeis very unlikely and that the burden of a property tax that is distortionary at the margin falls on the owners of capital.\n\n",
