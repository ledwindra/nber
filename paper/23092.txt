The Impact of the Affordable Care Act Young Adult Provision on Childbearing, Marriage,
and Tax Filing Behavior: Evidence from Tax Data

January 2017
JEL No. I13,J12,J13
ABSTRACT
We use panel U.S. tax data spanning 2008-2013 to study the impact of the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) young adult provision on two important demographic outcomes—childbearing and
marriage. The impact on childbearing is theoretically ambiguous, as gaining insurance may
increase access to contraceptive services, while also reducing the out-of-pocket costs of
childbirth. The impact on marriage is also ambiguous, as marriage rates may decrease when
young adults have less need for dependent health insurance through a spouse, but may increase
when they are now allowed to stay on their parent’s plans even if they are married. Changes in
childbearing and marriage can, in turn, lead to changes in the likelihood of filing a tax return.
Since W-2 forms record access to employer-provided fringe benefits, we were able to examine
the impact of the coverage expansion by focusing on young adults whose parents have access to
benefits. We compare those who are slightly younger than the age threshold to those who are
slightly older. Our results suggest that the ACA young adult provision led to a modest decrease
in childbearing and marriage rates, though the propensity to file a tax return did not change
significantly.

1. Introduction

As an early provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurers and sponsors of self-insured
plans were required to allow dependents up to age 26 to remain on their parents’ private health
insurance policies. In this paper, we use U.S. tax data to examine whether providing a source of
health insurance unconnected to their own employment affects childbearing and marriage:
behaviors that are important in their own right, but also have implications for tax filing.
Prior to the reforms, young adults (generally defined as 19-25 year olds) were the most
uninsured age group. Several studies have examined the insurance and medical care access
effects of the ACA young adult (YA) provision, finding generally positive impacts.1 The
resulting increase in health insurance coverage and access to health care may, in turn, affect
childbearing and marriage behavior, though the expected direction of the effect is ambiguous.
Gaining access to coverage may increase the use of prescription contraceptives (Culwell and
Feinglass (2007)), which may reduce or postpone childbearing (Miller et al. (2013)). However,
health insurance coverage, and private health insurance coverage in particular, is associated with
better prenatal care and birth outcomes (Oberg et al. 1991, Braveman et al. 1993, Currie and
Gruber 1997, Kaestner 1999, Egerter et al. 2002), which may increase childbearing if young
adults expect better prenatal care and more positive birth outcomes. On the other hand, DeLeire
et al. (2011) find that Medicaid expansions for pregnancy coverage are not associated with
increased childbearing. We are not aware of any published study that has examined the ACA
YA provision’s impact on childbearing. In concurrent working papers, Abramowitz (2016)
examines childbearing using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the
1

See, for example, Sommers et al. (2013), Akosa Antwi et al. (2013), and Barbaresco et al. (2015).

National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), and finds that the YA provision decreased the
probability of childbirth and abortion, while increasing the use of long-term contraceptives, and
Ma (2015) uses birth certificate data and finds that the provision decreased fertility rates but
increased the share of children born to unmarried and less educated mothers.
Prior to the passage of the ACA, married children were generally not allowed on their
parents’ insurance plans (Levine et al 2011). The young adult provision of the ACA, however,
allows young adults to stay on their parent’s plans regardless of marital status; one might expect
that the extension of coverage to married young adults might thus increase marriage rates among
this population by reducing “non-marriage-lock.” At least one study of a prior insurance
expansion lends empirical support to such an expectation. Yelowitz (1998) finds that the
expansion of Medicaid eligibility to married parent families not on AFDC led to a 1.7percentage-point increase in the probability of marriage. However, gaining access to health
insurance coverage and health care might also lessen the incentive to get married. Several studies
have documented the tight connection between health insurance and marital status, particularly
for women (e.g. Peters et al. 2014, Lavelle and Smock 2012, Zimmer 2007). If the ability to gain
coverage through a potential spouse might be a positive incentive to marry,2 access to dependent
coverage through a parent instead would weaken the marriage incentive. Further, access to birth
control has been found to lead to delay in marriage (Goldin and Katz 2002 and Abramowitz
2014); an expansion of health insurance that covers such services might lead to a decline in
marriage among young adults. Delayed marriage has been shown to improve welfare: Dahl
(2010) shows that delayed marriage causes lower incidence of poverty at later ages for women;
2

Indeed, in a 2008 Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 7 percent of respondents said they or someone in their
household married in the past year “mainly to have access to [their] spouse’s health care benefits” or “mainly so
[their] spouse could have access to [their] health care benefits,” though, as is noted in Kaiser Family Foundation
(2008), the 7 percent figure is almost certainly a gross overestimate of the fraction of the population that marry for
health-insurance-related reasons.

3

Mincy et al. (2009) find no evidence, however, that marriage itself increases the earnings of lowincome fathers. Decker (2000) finds that the introduction of Medicaid, which made health
insurance available to single mothers, led to a 0.3-percentage-point increase in the probability
that a woman was a single mother with young children. Further, Abramowitz (forthcoming), in
the study most closely related to this one, uses American Community Survey data to examine the
impact of the ACA young adult provision on marriage, and finds that the provision led to a
decrease in the likelihood of marriage.
Changes in childbearing and marriage can, in turn, lead to changes in the likelihood of filing
a tax return. Numerous tax code provisions reduce taxes owed for those with children, including
dependent exemptions, the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Child and
Dependent Care Credit. Since claiming these benefits requires filing of a return, an increase in
childbearing may lead to an increase in filing and vice versa. However, if childbearing is also
associated with lower labor supply and earnings, filing may decline. The tax-filing impact of
marriage is also ambiguous, and depends on the incomes of the spouses relative to the filing
thresholds.3
In this study, we use tax data spanning 2008-2013 to estimate difference-in-differences
models of childbearing and marriage, comparing 24-25 year olds who were affected by the YA
provision to 27-29 year olds who were not. We make four novel contributions. First, we use
administrative data, which is less subject to misreporting than survey data. Second, we focus on
those whose parents are likely to have employer sponsored insurance (ESI) and so are affected
3

The filing threshold for married couples is twice the amount for singles. As a result, if a woman who is just above
the single filing threshold marries a man who has no earnings, the marriage would place the couple below the
married filing threshold, and they would not be required to file a return. On the other hand, if a man who earned
more than the married filing threshold married a woman who was below the single filing threshold, the marriage
would lead to the woman being required to file a return.

by the reform. Third and fourth, we estimate effects separately by schooling status, and by
parental socioeconomic status.
We find that the YA provision reduced childbearing among young women, particularly
among the unmarried, those with fewer than two prior children, and those not in post-secondary
school. In addition, we find that the YA provision led to a decline in marriage among 24-25
year olds, which is consistent with Abramowitz (forthcoming). However, we find little effect on
the propensity to file a tax return.

2. Data

We draw a sample from the population of U.S. federal tax documents that spans 2008-2013.
Using an existing tax data file from 1997 linking the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of primary
and secondary filers to the SSNs of their dependent children,4 we match the parents’ information
from W-2 forms filed in 2008-2013 to their children’s information on childbearing, marriage,
income, and other demographic variables from those same years.5

Because individuals older

than 18 years in 1997, or born after 1995, were less likely to be claimed as dependents in 1997,
we utilize information on birth cohorts from 1979 through 1995. This structure limits our pre-

4

Almost all children below 19 are likely claimed on a parent’s tax returns, especially given the substantial tax
benefits of claiming children. The dependent file based on claiming behavior is comprehensive in tax year 1997 and
in 2001 and forward, but is very limited prior to 1997 and in 1998-2000.
5
If the parents divorced between 1997 and the 2008-2013 period, we are still able to match the W-2 information
from both parents to the young adult. However, if one of the parents married or remarried, and the new spouse
provided a source of health insurance coverage for the young adult, we would miss such coverage.

5

trends tests to 2008-2009, as we cannot go back further than tax year 2008 and still have the full
set of control individuals of ages 27-29.6
We use information from Social Security Administration and tax records to measure
childbearing. Our preferred measure of childbearing uses a Social Security Administration file
to identify the date of birth for children of any of the young adults in our sample. Working
backwards from the birth date, we create a variable denoted “conception assuming full term,”
which indicates whether the young woman conceived a child in a particular year, assuming that
the newborn was born after a full-term, 9-month, pregnancy.7 This variable is available
regardless of whether a young adult files a tax return, and it treats the timing of control and
treatment periods correctly, as any births in a particular year should be influenced by policies in
place before conception as well as during pregnancy. As a robustness check, however, we also
use birth in a given tax year as the dependent variable.
As an alternative measure, we utilize the fact that tax data contains the Social Security
Number of any child claimed as a dependent of a taxpayer in a particular year. Using a file
provided by the Social Security Administration, we merge the birthdate of each child, and
identify a newborn by whether the taxpayer had a child in that tax year. This is, however,
limited to tax filers.
For our marriage outcome variable, we utilize information reported on Form 1040. We
consider an individual married if his or her filing status is married filing jointly or married filing

6

Since our oldest cohort was born in 1979, prior to 2008, this cohort was younger than 29.
To the extent that pregnancies were less than full term, this variable may wrongly assign conceptions in the
treatment period to the earlier control period, which would tend to bias our estimate downward. A similar bias
arises if time of birth is used to assign treatment and control periods, since some conceptions that occurred in the
control period would be treated as if they occurred in the treatment period.

separately. Note again, that this information is only available if the individual files a tax return.
In our main marriage specifications, we include all young adults, both men and women.
Ideally we would know parental ESI information for each year of our data. However, the
IRS employer requirement for reporting ESI started in 2012, and only for firms with over 250
workers.8 We thus also use parental employer-based retirement plans (available in all years) to
proxy for ESI. Tabulations from the CPS and the MEPS suggest that more than 90% of families
in which at least one parent contributes to a retirement plan are also covered by ESI, which
suggests validity of the proxy measure. As around 20% of families in the MEPS without
employer-sponsored retirement are covered by ESI, not contributing to a retirement plan is a
weaker proxy for lack of health insurance.
We also pull a set of demographic information from the young adults’ and parents’ tax
records, including marital status (from Form 1040), post-secondary attendance (from Form 1099T), and parental income (from the parents’ Form 1040).
In our main specifications, we only include young adult women; male health insurance
access is unlikely to affect the contraceptive use or pregnancy behavior of their partners.
We use a 1% random sample from the parent-child matched population for our analysis.
When we limit to 24-29 year olds, excluding 26 year olds and using all data from 2008-2013
except 2010, we obtain 401,922 person-year observations in our female sample.9 Table 1
presents sample statistics for two samples – females of ages 24-29, and females of ages 24-29

We examined our sample by year and age and observed that the number of individuals does not change in any
systematic way over time as we construct a balanced panel, except that the number of older-age individuals is
consistently lower than those of younger ages, likely due to 17 and 18 year olds being more likely to have left the
parental household in 1997. We found no evidence of systematic difference in sample size that would affect our
identification method (for example, between treatment and control, before and after the policy).

whose parents participated in a retirement plan. Around 9 percent report a newborn in a given
year, though the fraction is slightly lower when we limit to those whose parents contributed to a
retirement plan and so were likely to be covered by ESI.

3. Method

We initially estimate the impact of the YA provision with a simple difference-in-differences
(DD) specification. We compare those in the treatment ages (24-25 year olds) to those outside
the treatment ages (27-29 year olds), before and after the law. We exclude 26 year olds10 as they
are likely to have been in both the treatment and control groups in the prior year.
We estimate an equation of the form

where

age 24-25,

is a year fixed effect.11 The coefficient

.

We next conduct regression-adjusted versions of the DD calculations in which we account
for the national annual unemployment rate, age fixed effects, and an interaction between the two.
As these estimates may still mask causal effects that occur only among those whose parents have
ESI, our preferred DD model focuses on young adults with such parents.

10

We only exclude 26 year olds in the year in which they turned 26. These individuals are included in the sample in
other years under analysis.
11
Note that we do not include state fixed effects, as we cannot observe state of residence for young adults who do
not file a tax return and do not receive a W-2 or 1098-T form.

8

In all specifications, we exclude 2010 as a period of staggered implementation; some insurers
complied as early as spring 2010, but as most insurance plans renew on January 1st 2011, we
consider that the full implementation date.
To verify that our estimates are not driven by differential pre-existing trends between the
treatment and control groups, we test whether time trends in childbearing and marriage differed
between the treatment and control groups in our limited set of years prior to the policy change.
Reassuringly, the difference in pre-policy trends is not statistically significant for any of the
specifications.12
As a further specification test, we examine whether parental ESI (as proxied by parental
participation in a retirement plan) was affected by the ACA. If access was affected, the
composition of treatment and control groups could be endogenous to the reform. However, in a
DD model with parental health insurance as the dependent variable, the estimated impact was
small and statistically insignificant.13

4. Childbearing Results
4.1 Main Estimation Results

12

In the pre-trends tests for our preferred specifications in Column 3 of Table 2, the coefficients (st. errors) on
Treatment*PlaceboPost were 0.000 (0.005) in the Conception Assuming Full Term in SSA Data specification, 0.001 (0.005) in the Newborn in SSA Data specification, -0.002 (0.005) in the Newborn in Tax Data specification,
and 0.006 (0.007) in the Tax Return Filer specification. Abramowitz (2016) performed similar tests using a longer
pre-reform period, and also could not reject equality of trends. The levels are, however, different, with 5.2% of the
control group (24-25 year olds) conceiving a child in 2009, as compared to 7.2% of the treatment group (27-29 year
olds).
13
The estimated coefficient was actually negative at -0.001, with a standard error of 0.002.

9

Table 2 presents the results from our main specification. In Panel A, the dependent
variable indicates whether a conception occurred that resulted in a live birth, full-term,
pregnancy. In Column 1, we present results from a simple DD specification; the estimated
coefficient suggests that the YA provision decreased childbearing by 0.4 percentage points, and
this coefficient is marginally statistically insignificant. When adding controls in Column 2, the
result remains a decline of 0.4 percentage points, and is now highly statistically significant. In
Column 3, we cut the sample to those who are likely to be “treated” by the YA provision by
including only those whose parents have an employer-based retirement plan. In this preferred
specification, the estimated impact of the YA provision increases slightly to a 0.5 percentage
point decline (from a base of 7.7 percentage points, for a decrease of 6.5%), and is still highly
statistically significant. This reduction would amount to a decrease of around 4,500 births
annually.14
To examine the robustness of these results to alternative definitions of childbearing, we
change the timing of the dependent variable to be the birth (rather than conception) of a child in
the SSA data in Panel B and the presence of a newborn in tax data in Panel C. Since the timing
of these variables is not exact, one would expect the estimates to be biased downward. This is
indeed the case, as the estimated coefficients in the third column are smaller in magnitude (0.002 and -0.003) than in our preferred specification, and marginally statistically significant.
Since the dependent variables in Panel C is only observed when a woman files a tax return, one
might be concerned that if the young adult provision affected filing behavior, this change in the
sample might impact our estimates. Therefore, in Panel D we estimate the impact of the YA
14

The sample in this specification includes 93,170 young adults who are 24-25 years old, who represent 9,317,042
individuals given our 1% sampling rate. Thus, a 0.5 percentage point decline (assuming singleton births) is 46,585
fewer births. Since these are short run effects, it is not possible to know whether these are simply delayed births or
reductions in completed fertility.

10

provision on tax return filing. Although we find a significant increase in the DD specification
with controls, in the other two specifications the impact is small and insignificant, suggesting
that those results are likely not significantly impacted by policy-driven changes in filing
behavior.
Taken together, these results suggest that the YA provision led to a decline in
childbearing among the targeted population.

4.2 Alternative Treatment Group
To examine the robustness of our preferred estimates to include younger cohorts in our
treatment group, we expanded the estimation sample to 19-29 year olds. These results are
presented in Table 3. When 19-23 year olds are added to the treatment group, which now
includes those age 19-25, the impact on childbearing remains negative and statistically
significant, but now somewhat larger, with the YA provision estimated to have decreased the
propensity to have a child by 0.7 percentage points (or 11.1% compared to a base of 6.3
percentage points). These results could reflect that younger women’s usage of contraceptive
services may be more price sensitive, leading to larger reaction, and thus an even greater decline
in childbearing.

4.3 Results for Subsamples
To examine whether the impact of the YA provision differed according to young adults’
demographic characteristics, in Table 4 we re-estimate our preferred specification using a sample
11

of young adult men. We also split the sample according to the income of the young adult’s
parents in 1997. Column 1 again presents the results from our preferred specification.
In Column 2, when a sample of young men is used for the estimation, the estimated
coefficient for young men is smaller than that for young women, and is statistically
insignificant.15 This is consistent with the expectation that the YA provision would primarily
impact childbearing through young women gaining access to their parents’ insurance.
In Columns 3 and 4, we split the sample according to whether the young adult’s parents’
income in 1997 was lower or higher than the median income (approximately 250% of FPL).
Splitting the sample according to parental income is preferable to splitting according to the
young adults’ income, as parental income is likely to closely correlate with the young adult’s
socioeconomic status (SES), while the young adult’s income may differ substantially from their
SES while in school or starting out at a job. These specifications do not reflect much of a
difference across income groups, with childbearing reduced by similar magnitudes in the two
income groups (-0.006 vs. -0.007 percentage points).
Finally, in Table 5, we estimate effects by marital status, by birth parity, and by
enrollment in post-secondary education.16 Since childbearing behavior tends to differ by marital
status, estimating different effects by marital status is a natural extension. However,
Abramowitz (forthcoming) finds that the YA provision reduced marriage among the affected
ages, and so these groupings may be endogenous to the policy being studied. Table 5 results
suggest that the decline in childbearing was steeper among unmarried young adults (with no
significant effect for those married), those who already had one child (with a smaller effect
15

However, the 95% confidence intervals of these two coefficients overlap

16

12

among those with no children, and no effect among those with two or more children), and those
who were not in post-secondary school. Given the findings in Abramowitz (forthcoming), an
alternative interpretation of the steeper decline among unmarried women could be that the YA
provision led young women who were not planning to bear a child to stay single, decreasing the
childbearing rate among this group.

5. Marriage and Tax Filing Results

Panel A of Table 6 presents the main results for the probability that an individual is married in
the tax data, with the first column presenting the estimate from a simple difference-indifferences, the second presenting results from a difference-in-differences that includes
covariates, and the third presenting results when the sample is cut to those likely to be treated.
The estimated coefficient is negative in all three specifications but is only significant in the third,
suggesting that including those who were not likely to be treated resulted in downward-biased
estimates. This coefficient implies that the YA provision decreased the propensity to be married
by 0.5 percentage points, from a base of 23.9%.
We only observe whether a young adult is married if the individual files a tax return, and
so the result may be biased if the policy impacted the propensity to file a tax return. In Panel B,
the dependent variable suggests that the YA provision led to a statistically significant increase in
filing among all young adults. Since nonfilers are more likely to be single, this would suggest

13

that our estimated impact on marriage may be biased upward toward finding more of an
impact.17
Table 7 presents results from adding 19-23 year olds to the treatment group. We treat
these results cautiously because of concerns related to the parallel trends assumption in marriage
rates for this age group relative to the control group. When this age group is added in Column 2,
the impact on marriage switches sign. In this specification, the YA provision is estimated to
have increased the likelihood of marriage by 0.8 percentage points. The rationale for this change
in sign could be the following. Prior to the YA provision, 19-23 year olds could have stayed on
their parents’ plans if they were students, so long as they remained unmarried. The YA
provision, then, primarily would have enabled these individuals to stay on parental plans even
while married, which would lead to an increase in marriage. 24-25 year olds, however, could not
stay on their parents’ policies (married or not) prior to ACA. For these young adults, the YA
provision primarily reduced the need for spousal health insurance, thus reducing the propensity
to marry.
To examine whether the impact of the YA provision on marriage differed according to
demographic characteristics, in Table 8 we re-estimate the preferred specification while splitting
the sample according to whether the young adult is male or female and by income.
In Columns 1 and 2, the direction of the YA provision’s impact on marriage is the same
for both genders, but the YA provision is estimated to have a larger impact on marriage for men
(a 0.6-percentage-point decrease compared with 0.3 percentage points for women).

17

If the YA provision led additional people to file a return, and those people are more likely to be single, then the
sample post-policy would tend to have fewer married taxpayers, which would be reflected in a negative coefficient.

14

In Columns 3 through 6, when the sample is split according to parental income, the
largest (and statistically significant) impacts on marriage are centered on the two middle-income
groups. It may be that these groups tend to be closer to the margin of deciding whether or not to
marry, and so the availability of health insurance from someone other than a spouse is more
likely to lead these individuals to delay getting married.
Overall, our results suggest that the ACA YA provision led to a decrease in marriage
among 24-25 year olds, which is consistent with the findings in Abramowiz (forthcoming).

6. Conclusion

There is very little evidence prior to the ACA regarding how access to health insurance
affects the demographic outcomes of young adults. Tax data provide a unique opportunity for
estimating the impact of the ACA YA provision on childbearing and marriage using a large
sample of administratively reported data, focusing on those whose parents were likely to have
ESI.
Taken as a whole, our results suggest that the YA provision led to a decrease in
childbearing among all young adult age cohorts, but that the effect may have been particularly
strong for 19-23 year olds, with our estimates implying declines of between 6.5% and 11.1%.
Assuming that dependent coverage increased by 30% among our treatment group (the preferred
estimate of Akosa Antwi et al. (2013)), the implied elasticity of childbearing to coverage would
be between 0.22 and 0.37. The YA provision also appears to have led to a decline in marriage

15

among 24-25 year olds. Finally, despite the decline in childbearing, tax filing appears to have
increased slightly post-reform.
We also find that reductions in fertility were only statistically significant among
unmarried young adults (not married young adults), although marriage itself maybe becoming
less prevalent as a result of the YA provision—thus, this indicates that either the law lead to less
marriage among those who were anyway less inclined to have children soon than other
unmarried women, or that the YA provision (perhaps through access to contraception) lead to
greater declines in fertility among those who are unmarried. We also find larger reductions
among those who already had one child (with a smaller effect among those with no children, and
no effect among those with two or more children), and those who were not in post-secondary
school, suggesting that there is heterogeneity in impact among young adults.
Some limitations to this study should be noted. First, due to data availability, our preand post-reform periods are limited to two years pre-reform and three years post-reform (through
the end of 2013). As a result, whether the effects found here will persist in the long term remains
to be seen. Second, the marriage outcome variable is only observed if an individual files a tax
return, and we found that return filing increased somewhat post-reform (though the effect is not
statistically significant in our main specification), which may bias our marriage estimate
somewhat. Third, our proxy for parental insurance coverage is not perfect. Finally, the results
found here pertain to one population (young adults with insured parents); whether similar effects
will result from other types of insurance expansions is a fruitful topic for future research.
