Under certain conditions, illiquidity discounts are higher when counterparties are harder to find, when sellers have less bargaining power, when the fraction of qualified owners is smaller, or when risk aversion, volatility, or hedging demand are larger. Supply shocks cause prices to jump, and then \"recover\" over time, with a time signature that is exaggerated by search frictions. We discuss a variety of empirical implications.\n\n",
