    "abstract": "\n\nIn his influential book, Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty argues forcefully that rising wealth and wealth inequality is an inherent characteristic of capitalist economies and calls for strong policy responses, in particular a substantial wealth tax implemented globally. This paper takes issue with the facts, logic, and policy conclusions in Piketty\u2019s book, suggesting that the factors needed to support the inexorable rise in capital\u2019s share and concentration are lacking and that among tax policy reforms aimed at dealing with economic inequality a wealth tax finds little support either in Piketty\u2019s own work or elsewhere in the literature.\n\n",
