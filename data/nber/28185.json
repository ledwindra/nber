    "abstract": "\n\nThe distinction between domicile and place of business is becoming more and more relevant as a growing number of firms have activities abroad. In most statistical studies of international stock returns, a firm is included in a country\u2019s index if its headquarters are located in that country. This classification scheme ignores the operations of the firm. We propose, instead, to measure the firms\u2019 exposures to \u201cgeographic zones\u201d according to the place where they conduct business. As a representation of \u201cgeographic risks\u201d, we synthesize zone factors from all firms in the dataset, be they domestic firms or multinationals. And we show the properties of the exposures to the zone factors.\n\n",
