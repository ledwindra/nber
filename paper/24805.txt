Reimbursement Rates for Primary Care Services: Evidence of Spillover Effects to Behavioral
Health

NBER Working Paper No. 24805

ABSTRACT
We study spillover effects from the largest increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates in the
history of the program for primary care services to behavioral health and healthcare outcomes;
mental illness, substance use disorders, and tobacco product use. Much of the variation in
Medicaid reimbursement rates we leverage is attributable to a large federally mandated increase
between 2013 and 2014. We apply differences-in-differences models to survey data specifically
designed to measure behavioral health outcomes over the period 2010 to 2016. We find that
higher primary care Medicaid reimbursement rates improve behavioral health outcomes among
enrollees. We find no evidence that behavioral healthcare service use is altered. Previous
economic research shows that the mandated boost increased office visits. Thus our results suggest
that primary care providers are efficient in improving behavioral health outcomes among
Medicaid enrollees. Given established shortages of behavioral health providers, these findings are
important from a healthcare workforce and policy perspective.

1. Introduction
Provider participation in insurance markets is a critical component to healthcare access.
In mixed-economy markets public payers, on average, offer lower reimbursement rates than
other payers to providers for the same services (Sloan, Mitchell et al. 1978, Berman, Dolins et al.
2002). This disparity in reimbursement rates can discourage providers from participating in
public markets, which likely reduces access to care and the value of insurance for enrollees.
Within the United States imperfect provider participation in public markets is a long-standing
concern among health policymakers (Decker 2012). The problem is particularly severe in the
Medicaid market. Medicaid, a joint federal and state program, is the primary insurer of lowincome individuals in the U.S., covering 77 million adults and children in 2017 (Sommers and
Grabowski 2017). The program has historically offered substantially lower reimbursement rates
than private insurance and other forms of public insurance; e.g., Medicare 1 (Berman, Dolins et
al. 2002, Zuckerman and Goin 2012, Zuckerman, Skopec et al. 2014, Zuckerman, Skopec et al.
2017). As prima facie evidence that low reimbursement rates deter provider participation, in
2013 over 30% of physicians were not accepting new Medicaid patients (Hing, Decker et al.
2015). For comparison, 16% and 15% of physicians were not accepting new Medicare or private
insurance patients while 5% were not accepting any new patients
To address limited provider participation, between 2013 and 2014 as part of the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) the U.S. federal government mandated, and fully financed, a
generous increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate for 146 primary care services. Qualifying
providers included family physicians, internists, and pediatricians, as well as other physicians
who demonstrated substantial delivery of primary care services to Medicaid patients. This

medical conditions (e.g., end-stage renal disease),

3

mandate is referred to as the ‘Medicaid fee bump.’ The fee bump was not re-authorized by the
federal government and ended December 31st, 2014. Some states used their own funds to
continue reimbursing Medicaid services at the enhanced rate beyond 2014. Thus, the fee bump
policy offers substantial variation in Medicaid reimbursement rates, a large initial increase
followed by a steep decline for most states.
The objective of the fee bump policy was to induce new primary care physicians to enter
the Medicaid market and to support previously participating physicians, and thus increase access
to care for Medicaid enrollees in advance of ACA implementation which involved a large-scale
increase in the number of individuals eligible for the program. The cost of the fee bump policy
to the federal government is estimated to be $7B to $12B (Medicaid and CHIP Payment and
Access Commission 2015). Hence, understanding the value of this policy is important.
Several studies show that the fee bump increased access to primary care providers and
office visits, and improved health. We extend this literature to study potential spillover effects
from primary care to behavioral health and healthcare service use outcomes. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to study this question. In particular, we examine mental illness,
substance use disorders (SUD), tobacco product use, and related service use. To this end, we
leverage rich survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) between
2010 and 2016 coupled with a differences-in-differences (DD) style design. We exploit variation
in the size of the fee bump in each state depending on its’ pre-2013 rate. The NSDUH is
designed and administered by the federal government to provide official estimates of behavioral
health outcomes and service use within the U.S, making this dataset ideal for our study.
Our extension to behavioral health is important for several reasons. First, the Medicaid
population has elevated rates of mental illness, SUDs, and tobacco product use and unmet needs

4

for treatment related to these outcomes (Busch, Meara et al. 2013, Creedon and Cook 2016,
DiGiulio, Haddix et al. 2016). Second, behavioral healthcare provider participation in Medicaid
is particularly scarce (Buck 2011, Bishop, Press et al. 2014) and there are overall shortages in
behavioral healthcare workers in the U.S. (Hyde 2013).
Third, behavioral healthcare is increasingly being delivered in primary care settings, in
particular treatment for mental illness and SUDs (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration 2016). For instance, psychotropic medications to treat mental illness (e.g.,
Xanax which is indicated for anxiety), medication-assisted therapies to treat SUDs (e.g.,
buprenorphine which is indicated for opioid use disorder [OUD]), and smoking cessation
medications (e.g., Zyban and Chanitx) can be prescribed by primary care physicians and are
effective (Cahill, Stevens et al. 2013, Murphy and Polsky 2016, Olfson 2016). Primary care is
defined as including ‘…health promotion, disease prevention, health maintenance, counselling,
patient education, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses in a variety of health
settings’ (American Academy of Family Physicians 2018), and thus can include management
and prevention of behavioral health conditions. Indeed, over 20% of primary care visits have a
mental health component (Cherry and Schappert 2014) which highlights the importance of
primary care for behavioral healthcare delivery. Several recent studies suggest that the ACA
Medicaid expansion, which raised eligibility through 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) in
participating states, substantially (22 to 70%) increased prescriptions for behavioral health
medications that are commonly prescribed by physicians in primary care settings (Maclean,
Carson et al. 2017, Maclean, Pesko et al. 2017, Maclean and Saloner 2017, Wen, Hockenberry et

5

al. 2017). These findings imply that there is plausibly pent up demand for behavioral healthcare
services among Medicaid enrollees. 2
Several findings emerge from our analysis. First, we document that the Medicaid fee
bump led to improvements in mental illness, SUDs, and tobacco product use among Medicaid
enrollees. Second, we find no statistically significant evidence that behavioral healthcare service
use changed following the fee bump. Combining our findings of improved behavioral health
outcomes with previous economic research that documents increased office visits post-fee bump
and clinical studies establishing the effectiveness of primary care in treating behavioral health,
we hypothesize that primary care providers are efficient in producing better behavioral health
among Medicaid enrollees. Given established behavioral healthcare workforce shortages, our
findings are relevant from a health economic, industrial relations, and policy standpoint.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 offers a discussion of the Medicaid fee bump
policy. Data, methods, and variables are reported in Section 3. Results are listed in Section 4.
Section 5 presents extensions and sensitivity analyses. Section 6 offers a discussion.
2. Related literature and background on the ACA-related Medicaid fee bump
2.1 Related literature
Several studies suggest that the ACA fee bump raised Medicaid reimbursement rates
(Kirby 2017), increased primary care provider participation in Medicaid (Polsky, Richards et al.
2015), increased prenatal care utilization among Medicaid enrolled pregnant women (Li, Pesko
et al. 2018), and increased office visits and improved health outcomes among Medicaid enrollees
(Alexander and Schnell 2017). When the federal fee bump policy ended in December 2014,
Medicaid appointment availability declined in states that did not maintain the previously

While we note that many behavioral health conditions cannot be ‘cured’, they can be effectively managed as is the
case for other chronic conditions; e.g., diabetes and heart disease (McLellan, Lewis et al. 2000).

6

mandated higher reimbursement rates (Candon, Zuckerman et al. 2018). However, one paper
suggests limited effects of the fee bump on physician participation in Medicaid (Decker 2016). 3
More generally, several studies leveraging pre-fee bump data show that higher Medicaid
reimbursement rates or capitation payments for primary care services increased access to primary
care. For instance, boosts in the reimbursement rate increased provider acceptance of Medicaid
patients (Decker 2012) and appointment availability for enrollees (Sharma, Tinkler et al. 2018).
In addition to improved access to care, higher reimbursement rates increased the likelihood of
patients reporting that physicians ‘listened and explained things’, which plausibly captures
patient-assessed quality of care, among Medicaid enrollees (Shen and Zuckerman 2005).
On the patient side, higher Medicaid reimbursement rates increased appointment uptake
(Decker 2009, Callison and Nguyen 2018), the likelihood of a usual source of care (Shen and
Zuckerman 2005), and having at least one physician or health professional visit in the past year
(Shen and Zuckerman 2005, Callison and Nguyen 2018). Further, enhanced reimbursement
improved pre-natal and infant health outcomes (Gray 2001, Sonchak 2015). Hahn (2013)
documents that higher reimbursement rates increased enrollment in public insurance among low
income children. This finding suggests that improved access to and/or quality of healthcare can
encourage program participation among eligible individuals.
To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of the ACA-related
Medicaid reimbursement fee boost on behavioral health outcomes and only one study examined
the effect of pre-ACA rate increases on these outcomes. In an extension of the main analysis of
general healthcare services, Decker (2009) used Medicaid reimbursement state-level variation

3

We note that increasing the number of physicians participating in Medicaid is not necessary to enhance access,
service use, or health outcomes. For instance, if the fee bump induced increased participation among incumbent
physicians (i.e., the intensive margin) and/or improved quality of care, then we would expect to observe increased
access and utilization, and improved health among enrollees.

from 1993 to 2003 and found that decreasing the primary care reimbursement rate from 100% to
64% of Medicare payments resulted in a 43% increase in major depressive episodes being treated
in hospital outpatient departments compared to a physician’s office. While this study is both
important and interesting, it did not explore the effect of Medicaid reimbursement rates on the
overall amount of behavioral healthcare utilization and instead focused on treatment setting for
one condition. There are important differences across major classes of mental illness, SUDs, and
tobacco products in terms of propensity to seek treatment overall and in primary care settings
specifically (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017). Further, there have been
major advancements in behavioral healthcare treatment from the 1990s to the 2010s, in particular
for medication prescribing in primary care settings. Perhaps most importantly, the previous
study did not investigate the effect of reimbursement rates on behavioral health outcomes.
2.2 Medicaid reimbursement rates
Medicaid has historically reimbursed providers at a lower rate than any other insurer. For
instance, in 2012 the fee-for-service Medicaid reimbursement rate for primary care services
averaged 59% of Medicare 4 rates (Zuckerman and Goin 2012). Moreover, there has been
substantial heterogeneity across states in reimbursement rates. In 2012, 5 state Medicaid
programs reimbursed primary care services at less than 50% of the Medicare rate and 35 states
reimbursed at less than 75% (Zuckerman and Goin 2012).
Lack of provider participation in Medicaid was a major concern among policymakers in
the lead up to the ACA. As noted earlier, a core provision of the ACA was to expand Medicaid
eligibility to non-disabled and childless adults with incomes through 138% of the FPL. PreACA simulations predicted that this expansion would increase Medicaid enrollment by roughly

8

17M or 6.3% (Buettgens and Holahan 2010). 5 Section 1202 of the ACA required states to set
Medicaid fee-for-service reimbursement rates for 146 primary care services at least at parity with
Medicare in 2013 and 2014 (Tollen 2015). 6 The federal government financed the full amount of
the Medicaid reimbursement rate increase over this period. The objective of this policy was to
encourage primary care providers to participate, or increase participation, in Medicaid prior to
the major 2014 expansion of this program. While the reimbursement rate increase was effective
January 1st, 2013, the federal government did not release final guidance to state Medicaid
programs until November 2012 (Tollen 2015). 7 The delayed federal guidance led some states to
pay physicians retrospectively. The federal government was not able to re-authorize the fee
bump beyond December 31st, 2014. In January 2015, only 16 states and DC used their own
funds to continue to finance the enhanced reimbursement rates (Tollen 2015).
Services subject to the ACA Medicaid fee bump policy included Evaluation &
Management (E&M) codes 99201 through 99449 in the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding
System (HCPCS) (Tollen 2015). These codes include primary care office visits, hospital visits,
and select vaccine administration codes. Importantly, the targeted E&M code range includes a
set of primary care services that are important in Medicaid but not reimbursed by Medicare.
Specifically, affected codes include new patient/initial comprehensive preventive medicine,
established patient/periodic comprehensive preventive medicine, counseling risk factor reduction
and behavioral change intervention, and E&M/non face-to-face physician services (Kaiser
Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2012).

5

This estimate is for both Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Managed care plans often receive monthly capitation payments based on what states would have paid for care on a
fee-for-service basis (Zuckerman and Goin 2012), Thus, the fee-for-service reimbursement ratio that we use should
proxy managed care payments as well as fee-for-service payments.
7
The delay in payments is attributed to difficulties in applying the fee bump to managed care Medicaid and the fact
that providers had to declare that they met requirements and these declarations had to be confirmed. Further, final
guidance from the federal government was issued less than two months of the effective date.
6

9

Many of these services are plausibly related to behavioral healthcare. For instance, the
HCPCS for smoking cessation counselling are 99406 and 99407 (Centers for Medicare Medicaid
Services 2003). Preventive medicine codes 99381 to 99397 include ‘counseling/anticipatory
guidance/risk factor reduction interventions’ and thus can include counselling services for
behavioral health more broadly (e.g., screeners for depression and anxiety, and problematic
alcohol use or psychoactive drug use). Finally, improvements in general health (affected codes
clearly cover related services) can indirectly improve behavioral health.
Appendix Table 1 reports the average Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement ratio in 2012
and the increase in this ratio that was induced by the fee bump policy for the period 2013 to
2014. There was a wide range of variation in the 2012 ratio across states, and hence the intensity
of fee bump policy. For instance, in 2012 the lowest ratio was 0.34 (Rhode Island) and the
highest ratio was 1.37 (North Dakota), with 2 states reimbursing Medicaid at or above the
Medicare rate (and hence receiving no federal funds for reimbursement rate increases). We
leverage this variation in our empirical models to identify fee bump effects.
Increasing reimbursement rates to induce providers to participate in Medicaid is well
founded in standard economic theory of physician behavior. The seminal Sloan, Mitchell et al.
(1978) model describes the behavior of physicians operating in a mixed-payer market. In this
model, there are three types of patients that can be selected by providers based on their
reimbursement rates: privately insured (who are assumed to offer the highest reimbursement
rate), Medicaid patients, and uninsured patients (who are assumed to offer the lowest
reimbursement rates). The model abstracts from other forms of public insurance for tractability.
Physicians chose to participate in specific markets based on their marginal cost curves.
Physicians with the lowest marginal cost curves will participate in all three markets while those

10

with the highest marginal cost curves will participate in the private market only. Physicians with
intermediate marginal cost curves will participate in the private and public markets.
We can use insight from the Sloan model to predict how the fee bump policy will
influence physician participation in Medicaid. 8 Increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates will
make participating in Medicaid relatively more attractive for all physicians. However, the higher
rates will only induce changes in market participation for a sub-set of physicians; i.e., those
physicians on the margin of participating pre-policy. Some physicians who only participated in
the private market pre-Medicaid fee increase will opt to enter the Medicaid market when
reimbursement rates increase. Further, some incumbent physicians, participating only the private
and Medicaid markets or all three markets, will increase the number of Medicaid patients they
treat post-policy. We expect this increased participation by new and incumbent physicians to
improve access to primary care services and behavioral health among Medicaid enrollees. 9
3. Data, variables, and methods
3.1 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
Our primary dataset is the NSDUH. We use data from 2010 to 2016 and thus consider
periods before, during, and after the large federally mandated fee bump policy was effective.
The NSDUH is a large-scale survey dataset administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) which is used to produce the primary official
estimates of behavioral health in the U.S. (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality
2016). Indeed, the NSDUH is the largest behavioral health survey in the U.S.
The NSDUH is a survey of individuals aged 12 or older in non-institutional settings and
is designed to be representative at the national and state level. Each year, the NSDUH surveys

We note that we cannot test predictions from the Sloan model in our survey data.
The Sloan model predicts the opposite pattern of results when the fee bump policy ends.

11

approximately 70,000 U.S. residents. The NSDUH contains items specifically designed to
measure behavioral health and healthcare utilization. Further, these data are commonly used by
economists to study behavioral health outcomes (Zarkin, French et al. 1998, Wen, Hockenberry
et al. 2015, Carpenter, McClellan et al. 2017, McClellan 2017, Alpert, Powell et al. 2018, Evans,
Lieber et al. 2018). We use the restricted access NSDUH with geographic identifiers which
allow us to link each state’s Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement ratio to the data. Following
NSDUH guidelines for use of the restricted data, all sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 100.
We exclude Tennessee as this state did not a have fee-for-service Medicaid program over
our study period. Hence we cannot calculate a fee-for-service fee bump ratio for this state. We
note our inability to study Tennessee as a limitation. We retain respondents ages 19 to 64 years
old enrolled in Medicaid; NSDUH records insurance coverage at the survey interview.
3.2 Outcome variables
We consider three measures of behavioral health and two measures of related healthcare
utilization. Our measures of behavioral health are indicators for a mental illness in the past year,
an SUD in the past year, and any tobacco product (tobacco cigarettes, smokeless tobacco [i.e.,
snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or ‘snus’], cigars, or pipe tobacco) use in the past 30 days. Broadly,
the mental illness and SUD indicators are based on screeners used to capture individuals at
elevated risk for these conditions in survey settings. Tobacco product use captures self-reported
utilization of these products. Full details on the construction of these variables can be found in
the NSDUH Methodological Summary Report (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics Quality
2016). The validity of these measures in has been established by NSDUH administrators and
epidemiologists (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics Quality 2016).

12

Our measures of behavioral healthcare are any mental illness treatment in the past year
and any SUD treatment in the past year. An important caveat to these measures is that they
reflect any type of care that a patient may perceive as behavioral healthcare; regardless of
whether or not such care was provided by physician affected by the fee bump, some other
provider, or informal care (e.g., self-help addiction treatment, or religious counselling). A
limitation of the NSDUH for our study is that the survey does not collect information on
smoking cessation treatment utilization.10 11
3.3 Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratio
For each year between 2010 and 2016, we construct annual, state-level primary care feefor-service Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratios using data from various think tank
reports (Zuckerman and Goin 2012, Smith, Gifford et al. 2015, Zuckerman, Skopec et al.
2017). 12 The Medicaid-to-Medicare fee index measures the ratio of each state’s average
Medicaid fee for primary care services to the Medicare fee for the same service. For each state,
these fee ratios are averaged across major primary care procedure codes, such as procedure codes
for new or established patient visits. Procedure codes are weighted by the share of total U.S.
Medicaid spending across the surveyed procedure. Previous studies have also used the ratio in
health and healthcare analyses (Decker 2009, Decker 2012, Polsky, Richards et al. 2015,
Callison and Nguyen 2018, Candon, Zuckerman et al. 2018, Li, Pesko et al. 2018).

10

We note the possibility that some respondents may include tobacco cessation treatment with SUD treatment,
either because some respondents view tobacco as a substance or because many SUD treatment facilities offer
smoking cessation services (Friedmann, Jiang et al. 2008).
11
There are some differences in respondent non-response rates across outcome variables. Hence, sample sizes vary.
12
For 2015 values, we use data collected by Zuckerman, Skopec et al. (2017), unless Smith, Gifford et al. (2015)
note that the fee bump remained fully in place in 2015, in which case we use 100% for these states. For 2010 and
2011 values, we linearly impute Medicaid reimbursement ratios between 2008 and 2012 using data collected by
Zuckerman and Goin (2012). More details are available on request.

13

The intensity of the federally mandated increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates
between 2013 and 2014 is determined by states’ pre-2013 ratio. Put differently, states with
relatively low Medicaid reimbursement rates vis-à-vis Medicare pre-2013 experienced a
comparatively large boost in the ratio over the period 2013 to 2014. The median increase
attributable to the fee bump was 30 percentage points (p.p.) between 2012 and 2013; with a
minimum of 0 p.p. and a maximum of 66 p.p. Similarly, the decline in Medicaid reimbursement
rates in 2015 (as the mandate was not re-authorized) was determined by states’ discretion in fee
rate setting. The median decline in the ratio between 2014 and 2015 was 29.5 p.p.
The ‘look back’ period of our outcome variables is the past year or the past 30 days. 13
The NSDUH provides the exact date on which a respondent completed the survey. We use
survey date information to construct a past year moving average of the reimbursement rate. 14
Although there were some delays in fee bump payment to physicians in early 2013, we
follow Alexander and Schnell (2017) and do not incorporate such delays into our matching of the
fee bump to the NSDUH data, besides using the look back period matching described above.
This decision is based on the assumption that affected physicians expected to receive payments
in the future from Medicaid. 15 However, we show that our results are robust to dropping year
2013 (the time period in which the enhanced rates were paid retrospectively).
3.4 State-level control variables

13

We note that our tobacco product use variable has a 30 day look back period. Tobacco product use is a stock
variable determined by flows into (initiation) and out of (cessation) product use. We expect that in our sample of
adults cessation is the most likely flow variable as most tobacco product initiation occurs before age 18. Cessation
is a time-intensive activity and thus we argue that using the12 month moving average for the fee bump variable,
rather than more immediate measure, is reasonable.
14
More specifically, we construct an average of the fee bump ratio in the survey month and the 11 months prior to
the interview. For instance, if a respondent was interviewed in January 2012, we calculate the average fee bump
over the period February 2011 through January 2012. More details available on request.
15
Indeed, slow payments are commonly reported by physicians who treat Medicaid patients (Rosenbaum 2014).

14

To minimize omitted variable bias, we control for several state-level variables in our
regressions that plausibly predict both behavioral health outcomes and the Medicaid-to-Medicare
fee ratio in a state. These variables are merged into the NSDUH from external sources on state
and year. First, we control for the state unemployment rate. Second, we account for state
policies plausibly related to behavioral health outcomes: tobacco cigarette tax per pack,
indicators for an e-cigarette tax and an e-cigarette public use ban (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2018), 16 a prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) (Ali, Dowd et al.
2017), and a medical marijuana law (Sabia and Nguyen 2016). Finally, we include an indicator
for ACA-related Medicaid expansion following Maclean, Pesko et al. (2017). Inclusion of a
Medicaid expansion control is particularly important as this policy may have altered the
composition of enrollees. We examine this question further in robustness checks.
3.5 Empirical model
We apply the differences-in-differences (DD) regression model outlined in Equation (1):
(1)

𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 = 𝜶𝜶𝟎𝟎 + 𝜶𝜶𝟏𝟏 𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓_𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 + 𝜶𝜶′𝟐𝟐 𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊,𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 + 𝜶𝜶′𝟑𝟑 𝑿𝑿𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚 + 𝜽𝜽𝒔𝒔 + 𝝉𝝉𝒚𝒚 +

𝜼𝜼𝒎𝒎 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚

𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 is a behavioral health outcome for individual i in state s in year y and month m.

𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓_𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 is the 12-month moving average Medicaid-to-Medicare

reimbursement fee ratio in state s in year y and month m, which is heavily influenced by the
Medicaid fee bump in 2013 and 2014, and whether this policy was continued or not. 𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊,𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 is a

16

States that have implemented an e-cigarette tax have done so in different ways. E.g., ad valorem or value-added
tax. To the best of our knowledge, there is no standardized approach to classifying e-cigarette taxes at this time.
Hence, we simply code states as implementing or not implementing such a tax.

15

fixed effects. These fixed effects capture time-invariant state characteristics, factors that affect
the nation as a whole, and seasonality in behavioral health respectively. 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 is the error term.

We cluster standard errors around the state (Bertrand, Duflo et al. 2004) and apply NSDUH

survey weights. We estimate logit models and report estimates of average marginal effects.
3.6 Internal validity
A necessary assumption for a DD model to recover causal estimates is that the treatment
and the comparison groups would have followed the same trend in outcomes in the posttreatment period, had the treatment group not been treated. Our empirical specification is a
variant of the canonical DD as our treatment, the Medicaid-to-Medicare ratio, is a continuous
variable rather than an indicator. To provide some evidence as to whether or not parallel trends
exist, we classify states as ‘large’ and ‘small’ fee bump states depending on if they have above or
below the median increase in the Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratio of 30% between
2012 and 2013. 17 We first examine unadjusted trends in the pre-treatment period in our outcome
variables for large and small fee bump states. If outcomes appear to have trended similarly in
states that experienced large and small increases in the Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee
ratio, then this pattern would provide evidence that the parallel trends assumption has been met
in the NSDUH data and support the validity of our design.
Our second approach to explore the parallel trends assumption is to use data prior to the
fee bump (2010-2012) to estimate Equation (2):
(2)

𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 = 𝜸𝜸𝟎𝟎 + 𝜸𝜸𝟏𝟏 𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒔𝒔 ∗ 𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒚𝒚 + 𝜸𝜸′𝟐𝟐 𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊,𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 + 𝜸𝜸′𝟑𝟑 𝑿𝑿𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚 + 𝜽𝜽𝒔𝒔 + 𝝉𝝉𝒚𝒚 + 𝜼𝜼𝒎𝒎 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚

This equation is similar to Equation (1) with the exception that we replace the Medicaid-to-

Medicare reimbursement fee ratio with an interaction between the large fee bump state indicator
17

Large fee bump states are: AL, AR, CA, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, MA, MD, ME, MI, MO, NH, NJ, NV, NY, OH, PA,
RI, SD, TX, WA, and WI.

and a linear time trend (𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒔𝒔 ∗ 𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒚𝒚 ). 18 If we cannot reject the null hypothesis that 𝛾𝛾1 is
zero, then this finding provides further support that the NSDUH can satisfy the parallel trends
assumption. To avoid difficulties in interpreting interaction terms in non-linear models
(Popovici, Maclean et al. 2018), we estimate Equation (2) with a linear probability model. 19
4. Results
4.1 Summary statistics
Table 1 reports summary statistics for the 2010 to 2012 pre-ACA fee bump period for
Medicaid recipients. 30.8% and 11.6% of the sample met criteria for mental illness and an SUD
in the past year, respectively, while 41.6% used a tobacco product in the past 30 days. 20 In terms
of past year behavioral healthcare utilization, 23.4% reported any mental illness treatment and
4.5% reported any SUD treatment. The mean Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratio
was 0.73 (compared to a median value of 0.70; not reported but available on request).
Figure 1 reports the average, maximum, and minimum Medicaid-to-Medicare
reimbursement fee ratio over our study period. Prior to 2013 the average ratio was relatively
low, however in 2013 the fee bump-attributable boost is evident with the average ratio increasing
from 70.9% in 2012 to 101.3% in 2013. Similarly, the sharp decline in the fee bump in 2015 is

18

This trend takes the value of 1 in January 2010, 2 in February 2010, 3 in March 2010, and so forth.
A limitation of our explorations of internal validity is that both our ‘treatment’ (large fee bump) and ‘comparison’
(small fee bump) groups were both treated by the policy. The intuition of our testing is that effects should be more
substantial in states that experienced a larger ‘dose’ of the fee bump policy (i.e. the large fee bump state group).
However, we note that there is a monotonicity assumption that underlies this testing, that is the effects of the policy
increase with the size of the fee bump. This assumption may be violated due to physician or patient attributes and
preferences, features of healthcare delivery systems, patient health needs, and so forth. Thus, we interpret our
findings based on these analyses with some caution.
20
We note that the share of the sample reporting any tobacco use is somewhat higher than the national average
cigarette smoking rate over our stud period, roughly 20% (National Center for Health Statistics 2017). However,
tobacco product use is more common among Medicaid enrollees, and our measure of tobacco product use is more
comprehensive than standard measures that capture only tobacco cigarette use.
19

17

evident as the federal mandate was not continued by the majority of states. The average rate
continued to decline through 2016 (the last year of our study period).
4.2 Internal validity
Trend analyses of our outcomes are reported in Figures 2 to 6 for large and small fee
bump states. With the possible exception of SUD treatment, which is a relatively rare outcome
(4.5% of the sample reports this outcome) and appears noisy in the graphs, these figures show
similar trends over the period 2010 to 2012.
We report regression-based parallel trends testing in Tables 2 (outcomes) and 3
(utilization). We cannot reject the null hypothesis that 𝛾𝛾1 = 0 in any of the five regressions.

Indeed, the coefficient estimates on the interaction between the large fee bump indicator and
time trend are small in magnitude and statistically indistinguishable from zero.
4.3 Behavioral health outcomes
Table 4 reports fee bump regression results for behavioral health outcomes. We measure
reimbursement rates with the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio. Thus, our estimates capture the
effect of increasing this ratio from 57.2% to 100% (42.8 p.p.), which corresponds to the increase
from the average fee ratio among large fee bump states prior to the fee bump policy to Medicare
parity. For brevity, we refer to this change in the ratio as the ‘average increase’.
We find that the average increase in the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio leads to a 2.9 p.p.
decrease in mental illness (9.7%; all relative effect sizes are calculated by comparing the
marginal effect estimate with the sample proportion prior to the fee bump), a 1.7 p.p. decrease in
SUD treatment (15.2%), and a 2.4 p.p. decrease in tobacco product use (6.0%).
Our relative effects are somewhat large in size because the baseline proportions for some
of our outcomes are relatively small and we focus on a sample (Medicaid enrollees) with

18

elevated prevalence of behavioral health conditions. Finally, we consider an arguably non-trivial
treatment ‘dose’ (i.e., increasing the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio from 57.2% to 100%).
4.4 Behavioral healthcare outcomes
Estimates of the effect of raising the Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratio on
behavioral healthcare use are reported in Table 5. As noted earlier, NSDUH only allows us to
study mental illness and SUD treatment use. We find no statistically significant evidence that
increasing the ratio changes utilization of these services.
5. Extensions and sensitivity analyses
We next report from extensions and additional analyses.
5.1 Effects on coverage
We next explore whether the fee bump had any effect on the probability of Medicaid
coverage. We focus on a sample with family income less than 400% of the FPL to examine a
group that is plausibly eligible for Medicaid. 21 Information on insurance status in the NSDUH to
construct an indicator variable for Medicaid coverage. Increased ability to access providers, or
to receive higher quality care, may induce some Medicaid-eligible individuals to enroll in the
program (Hahn 2013). On the supply side, providers, when faced with a higher reimbursement
rate, may be more likely to enroll eligible uninsured patients in Medicaid. Finally, for some
privately insured patients who are eligible, higher quality Medicaid coverage may induce them to
drop private coverage and take up Medicaid (‘crowd out’) (Cutler and Gruber 1996). Further,
from a purely empirical standpoint, we define our sample based on Medicaid enrollment. If our
treatment variable influences the probability of Medicaid coverage, then we are selecting our
sample on an endogenous variable which can lead to bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009).

21

We could have chosen a lower income threshold but we are concerned that individuals may target income to gain
Medicaid eligibility (Hamersma 2013).

19

We report results in Table 6. We find no statistically significant evidence that the
Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio predicts the probability of Medicaid coverage. 22 This null
finding suggests that our treatment variable does not alter the composition of our sample and we
are not selecting the sample on an endogenous variable.
5.2 Alternative measures of behavioral healthcare service use
Our measures of behavioral healthcare treatment capture any service use related to
behavioral health. However, these measures may not reflect improvements in the quality or
appropriateness of behavioral healthcare services that could have been induced by the fee bump
policy. To probe deeper into changes in other dimensions of behavioral healthcare service use
following the fee-bump, we consider proxies for perceived adequacy of care. To this end, we
use indicators for past year perceived unmet need for mental illness and SUD treatment. 23 These
measures capture broader concepts of acceptable/appropriate care from the patient’s perspective
that may be missed through the use of simple indicators for receiving any care. For instance,
seeing a physician but not feeling that the visit adequately treated healthcare needs would be
incorporated in a measure of any care receipt but, perhaps, not a measure of unmet need for care.
Utilization of healthcare could also paradoxically increase unmet need if it makes patients aware
of new diagnoses for which they are not immediately receiving desired treatment and/or

22

We have also confirmed these findings in the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is a much larger
survey than the NSDUH, roughly three million respondents per year, and is designed to provide accurate estimates
of insurance outcomes. This survey does not record behavioral health outcomes or service use. Results are
comparable and available on request. Interesting, in the NSDUH (but not in the ACS) we find some evidence that
increases in Medicaid reimbursement rates raises the probability that a respondent is uninsured at the time of the
survey. We find no evidence for changes in private coverage. We are uncertain as to the mechanism that may lead
to this counter-intuitive finding for uninsurance status.
23
Specific question wording for unmet mental illness treatment need is ‘Felt a perceived need for mental health
treatment/counseling that was not received.’ Specific question wording for unmet SUD treatment need is ‘Felt a
need for illicit drug or alcohol treatment or felt need for additional illicit drug or alcohol treatment in past year’.

20

improved knowledge of healthcare and health generally. Thus, the extent to which the fee bump
policy affects perceived unmet need is ex ante ambiguous.
Results are reported in Table 7. We find no statistically significant evidence that the
Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio predicts the probability of either of these outcomes. The null
findings could reflect patients switching from specialty care to primary care as higher
reimbursement rates afford better access. Indeed, many patients report that they would prefer to
receive care in general healthcare settings rather than through the specialty behavioral healthcare
delivery system (Boone, Brown et al. 2004).
5.3 Alternative time horizons
We next explore the robustness of our findings across various time horizons.
Specifically, we (i) drop 2013 (the year in which enhanced reimbursement rates were delayed to
some extent) and (ii) drop 2015-2016 (the period following the federal mandate for parity
between Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates for the 146 targeted services). Results are
reported in Tables 8A (outcomes) and 8B (service use). In terms of our behavioral health
measures, while we lose precision in some specifications (which is not surprising as we have less
variation with which to identify treatment effects), the direction and magnitude of the
relationship between the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio and outcomes is the same. Turning to
behavioral healthcare service use and in line with our preferred time period, none of the
coefficient estimates are statistically different from zero.
5.4 Alternative controls for between-state heterogeneity, weighting, and functional form
Tables 9A and 9B show results generated in models that (i) include state-specific linear
time trends, (ii) exclude all individual and time-varying state-level controls, (iii) remove sample
weights, and (iv) apply a linear probability model. We note that there is some difficulty in

21

interpreting coefficients generated in non-linear models with different sets of controls (Norton
2012, Maclean, Webber et al. 2014), which is a study limitation.
While we lose statistical significance in some specifications for behavioral health
outcomes (Table 9A), the direction and magnitude of our effect sizes are broadly comparable in
these sensitivity checks vis-à-vis our main specifications. Turning to our behavioral healthcare
utilization variables (Table 9B), as is the case in our preferred specification, no coefficient
estimates are statistically different from zero.
5.5 Heterogeneity by ACA-related Medicaid expansion status
Medicaid expansion, among the 31 states and the District of Columbia that adopted this
policy by the end of our study period (January 2016), substantially increased the number of
program enrollees (Frean, Gruber et al. 2017). 24 Moreover, this expansion plausibly altered the
composition of Medicaid enrollees. For instance, pre-Medicaid expansion simulations suggested
that the newly eligible had higher rates of SUDs and greater unmet need for SUD treatment than
previously eligible populations (Garfield, Zuvekas et al. 2011, Busch, Meara et al. 2013).
Further, capacity may be particularly strained within expansion states as Medicaid rolls increased
substantially. However, in Section 5.1 we found no statistically significant evidence that the fee
bump, our treatment variable, lead to changes in the probability of enrollment conditioning on
Medicaid expansion and other factors.
We dig deeper into these issues by stratifying our sample based on Medicaid expansion
status by January 2016. The sample of expansion states is subject to increased enrollment and
compositional shift while the samples of non-expansion states is less vulnerable to these factors
and may allow us to more cleanly identify fee bump effects. However, we note that ACA-related

24

We note that, at the time of writing Maine and Virginia have passed legislation designed to expand Medicaid. To
the best of our knowledge, no implementation dates for these expansions have been set.

22

changes lead to other groups enrolling in Medicaid; i.e., welcome mat effects and changes in
Modified Adjusted Gross Income. Hence, non-expansion states may have been subject to similar
changes although we argue that any changes are likely smaller in non-expansion states.
Results from this analysis are reported in Table 10A (outcomes) and 10B (service use).
While we lose precision across the subsamples (which naturally rely on less variation in the
Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio), the direction of magnitude and direction of the effects are
broadly comparable across expansion and non-expansion states. However, in terms of
behavioral healthcare service use, we find some evidence that mental illness treatment declined
in non-expansion states as the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio increased.
5.6 Heterogeneity by sex
There are well-established differences in both behavioral health and service use. Women
are more likely to experience mental illness and are more likely to use both general and
behavioral healthcare services than men, while men are more likely to use substances (Center for
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
2017). Given these differences across men and women, we explore heterogeneity in the
Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio across gender. Results are reported in Tables 11A and 11B.
The fee bump has differential effects across sex in terms of behavioral health outcomes.
Increases in the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio lead to reductions in mental illness among
women, and SUDs and tobacco product use among men. Turning to measures of service use, we
observe no statistically significant evidence that women experience changes in behavioral
healthcare service use when the Medicaid-to-Medicare ratio increases. However, among men,
we document that increases in this ratio leads to a decrease in SUD treatment. One possible
explanation for this counter-intuitive finding is that men, who are more likely to be diagnosed

23

with OUD (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017) which can be treated in
primary care office-based settings, substitute specialty care for primary care treatment.
5.7 Alternative samples based on income and insurance coverage
We next test for spillovers to higher income groups following Alexander and Schnell
(2017). In particular we select a group of respondents that is unlikely to be Medicaid eligible at
any point over our study period (i.e., before or after the ACA Medicaid expansion): adults with
family incomes >400% FPL. Individuals with this income level are above all state Medicaid
thresholds for all years of our study (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2017).
On the one hand, capacity constraints (e.g., a physician can only work so many hours per day) or
income effects (e.g., higher income from Medicaid patients may lead some physicians to reduce
overall work time) may lead to worse care and outcomes for higher income patients through
reduced access and/or quality. On the other hand, previous work suggests spillovers across
patients with different insurance coverage within a practice (Glied and Zivin 2002, Finkelstein
2007, Glied and Hong 2018). For instance, increased delivery of targeted services (e.g.,
behavioral health counselling services) may lead to increases in these services for all patients
regardless of insurance status. Hence, the effects on non-targeted patients is ex ante ambiguous.
Results are reported in the top panels of Tables 12A (outcomes) and 12B (service use).
While there are numerous hypotheses that suggest changes in our behavioral health outcomes
among higher income groups not likely eligible for Medicaid, we find no statistically significant
evidence that the outcomes are affected. We note that our null findings are in line with findings
for general healthcare services (Alexander and Schnell 2017).
Medicaid coverage is likely reported with error by some respondents (Lo Sasso and
Buchmueller 2004, Kolstad and Kowalski 2012). To probe the sensitivity of our results (which

24

are based on a sample of reported Medicaid enrollees), we next expand our analysis sample to
include NSDUH respondents who report Medicaid or Medicare coverage (Hamersma and
Maclean 2018). Results are reported in the bottom panels of Tables 12A (outcomes) and 12B
(service use), and are very similar to our main findings. We interpret these findings to suggest
that our main results cannot be fully explained by reporting error in Medicaid enrollment.
5.8 Event-study design
A standard concern in analyses of healthcare policies is that changes in outcomes prompt
decision makers to implement policies. In other words, healthcare policy evaluation may be
vulnerable to reverse-causality at the state-level. To explore this possibility we estimate an
event-study design in the spirit of Autor (2003). We use the large fee bump indicator (see
Section 3.5) and estimate Equation (3):
2016
′
(3) 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 = 𝜸𝜸𝟎𝟎 + ∑2011
𝑗𝑗=2010 𝜹𝜹𝒋𝒋 (𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑠,𝑗𝑗 = 1) + ∑𝑗𝑗=2013 𝝆𝝆𝒋𝒋 (𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑠,𝑗𝑗 = 1) + 𝜸𝜸𝟏𝟏 𝑷𝑷𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚 +

𝜸𝜸′𝟐𝟐 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊.𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 + 𝜽𝜽𝒔𝒔 + 𝝉𝝉𝒚𝒚 + 𝜼𝜼𝒎𝒎 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚

The reference period in the event-study design is the year prior to the federally mandated fee
increased (2012). The vector 𝝆𝝆𝒋𝒋 reflects the effect of the fee increase in the post-mandate period

while the vector 𝜹𝜹𝒋𝒋 captures effects prior to the mandate. Studying estimates of pre-mandate

effects allow us to examine anticipatory behaviors and probe parallel trends after conditioning on
covariates. Results are reported in Tables 13A (outcomes) and 13B (service use).
The coefficient estimates on the lead variables are imprecise which provides additional
support for the hypothesis that the NSDUH data satisfy parallel trends. However, turning to the
lag estimates, we lose power to detect effects except for a 5.7 p.p. decrease in mental illness.
Coefficient estimates for tobacco use in 2013 and 2014 are also large in magnitude but not
statistically different from zero, potentially because the event study does not provide sufficient

25

power to detect even sizable increases in the post period. Moreover, as noted in Section 3.6,
both the large and small fee-bump states were treated by the policy. We suspect that a ‘treated’
comparison group may attenuate effects in the post-period. However, it is reassuring that our
event studies do not reveal evidence of differential pre-trends across groups.
5.9 Utilization of general healthcare services
We next focus on a broader set of general services to further examine the extent to which
primary care can improve behavioral health; either as a substitute for specialty or informal care
and/or addressing unmet need for care. We consider the following past year outcomes: the
number of outpatient visits, the number of emergency department (ED) episodes, and the number
of hospitalizations. However, outpatient visit information, an important location in which
primary care services targeted by the fee bump are likely to be delivered, is only available from
2013 onward in the NSDUH. Thus, we cannot leverage the large variation driven by the fee
bump between 2012 and 2013 and earlier (smaller) within state changes. We apply Poisson
models given that the outcomes are counts. We convert beta coefficients to average marginal
effects. Results are reported in Table 14.
We find no evidence that changes in the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio leads to changes
in the number of office visits or the number of ED episodes. However, we do find that the
average increase in this ratio leads to 0.7 fewer hospital admissions in the past year. We have
also estimated logit models in which the outcomes are indicators for using any of these services
in the past year and results (available on request) are similar.
6. Discussion
In this study we examine the effects of federal mandate that substantially increased
Medicaid reimbursement rates for a range of common primary care services. The rate boost

26

attributable to the policy we study is the largest federal increase within Medicaid; with premandate estimates suggesting that this policy would increase Medicaid rates by 73% (Zuckerman
and Goin 2012). Previous work had documented that this mandate was effective in increasing
Medicaid reimbursement rates, induced providers to participate in Medicaid, and increased use
of primary care visits and improved health among Medicaid enrollees (Polsky, Richards et al.
2015, Alexander and Schnell 2017, Kirby 2017, Li, Pesko et al. 2018). Our contribution to this
literature is to test for spillover effects to behavioral health outcomes and service use. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this question. Given the ability of primary care
providers to cost-effectively treat behavioral health conditions (e.g., prescribing medications,
patient education, counselling services, disease management) (American Academy of Family
Physicians 2018), testing for such spillovers is important.
We show that the mandated increase in primary care reimbursement rates within
Medicaid had positive spillovers to behavioral health outcomes: mental illness, substance use
disorders (SUD), and tobacco product use. Following the fee boost, behavioral health outcomes
improved while behavioral health service use was not altered. Interestingly, our results may
imply that primary care is efficient in delivering services to Medicaid enrollees that improve
behavioral health, perhaps more efficiently than specialty care; where a substantial amount of
behavioral health, particularly SUD, treatment has been delivered historically (Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration 2016).
Given established workforce shortages within the behavioral healthcare delivery system,
this finding is important as it suggests a feasible approach to addressing the behavioral healthcare
needs of Medicaid enrollees (Rosenbaum 2014). Further, patients who are reluctant to seek care
within the specialty delivery system may be more willing to receive treatment in non-specialty

27

settings such as primary care physicians’ offices (Boone, Brown et al. 2004). Allowing patients
to receive care in their preferred setting may, over time, allow for better treatment and in turn
outcomes. Indeed, an objective of the ACA was to better integrate behavioral health, in
particular SUD treatment, into general healthcare delivery (McLellan and Woodworth 2014).
In extensions to the main analyses, we show that the fee bump had differential effects
across states that did and did not expand Medicaid with the ACA, and men and women. Further,
we find no statistically significant evidence that the fee bump led to changes in the probability of
Medicaid coverage. Hence, the value of better access to care and/or higher quality care was not
sufficient to lead individuals to enroll in Medicaid. Finally, we note that the temporary nature of
the fee policy may have muted such effects. Policies that permanently increase Medicaid
reimbursement rates may have larger effects on outcomes.
The policy we study increased physician reimbursement rates for Medicaid patients
(albeit temporarily for many states). Low reimbursement rates have long been cited as a barrier
for participation in the program by physicians but increasing these rates is costly and politically
difficult. However, there are other aspects of treating Medicaid patients that may deter physician
participation in this market. For instance, physicians report that the administrative burdens (e.g.,
filling out numerous documents), delays in payment, and complex caseloads are barriers to
Medicaid participation (Rosenbaum 2014). If enhanced funding for elevated Medicaid
reimbursement rates is not feasible, either financially or politically, then policymakers may wish
to consider targeting other commonly cited barriers to program participation by providers. While
altering the health status of Medicaid enrollees is likely beyond the scope of near-term policies,
reducing administrative burdens and/or ensuring timely payments to physicians may be more
feasible. Providers consider both the costs and returns to treating patients. Hence both of these

28

objects could be targeted by policies and, in turn, potentially increase the number of providers
participating in Medicaid.
While we emphasize the direct role of obtaining more (or any) primary care services
within a group of patients with established healthcare access challenges in improving behavioral
health, other mechanisms may also play a role in our findings. First, in addition to being able to
access services, Medicaid patients may receive higher quality care. Given the wide range of
services covered by the fee bump, either new or incumbent patients may have access to a broader
set of services that allows for better and more comprehensive care. Similarly, physicians may
spend more time with Medicaid patients, new or incumbent, and this extended interaction may
offer more time for behavioral health conditions to be diagnosed (e.g., physicians may ask more
probing questions about mental health and use of substances), the correct treatment regime (e.g.,
carefully discussing the importance of regularly taking medications at required times), and/or
lifestyle changes (e.g., avoiding situations that may prompt substance use or lead to anxiety). Or
higher reimbursement rates may simply improve patient-provider interactions in other intangible
ways. We explore this avenue to some extent through indicators for unmet need but likely
cannot capture all aspects of care quality. Second, akin to the benefits of ‘conditional coverage’
(Marton and Yelowitz 2015, Burns and Dague 2017), simply knowing that quality care can be
accessed if needed may improve behavioral health (i.e., less anxiety, less self-medication through
substances and tobacco products). 25 Third, improvements in general health outcomes as
documented by Alexander and Schnell (2017) may have spillover effects for behavioral health
(e.g., better management of chronic conditions such as diabetes may improve mental health).
Fourth, among parents, improved access to services and health outcomes among children

25

However, we expect that an individual must be enrolled in Medicaid to experience the effects of the fee bump and
hence the phenomena we capture here is somewhat different from conditional coverage.

29

(Alexander and Schnell 2017) may have further health benefits (e.g., earlier diagnoses and
treatment of communicable illnesses such as the flu, less stress related to poor child health).
These pathways likely do not operate independently and instead interact to generate the
improvements in behavioral health that we observe.
Our study has limitations. (i) We have imperfect information on the settings in which
targeted primary care services are likely to be received (i.e., outpatient visits) in the NSDUH.
(ii) We are not able to explore whether the fee bump induced new physicians to participate in
Medicaid, increased participation among incumbent physicians, and/or (iii) altered practice styles
(e.g., use of substitutes such as nurse practitioners). These are economically interesting and
policy-relevant questions that could be explored in other datasets. (iii) Our measures of
behavioral health are based on survey data and thus may be subject to reporting bias. However,
we note that the NSDUH measures have been validated and are collected by trained survey
administrators in a government survey designed to provide official statistics on behavioral health
for the nation. Moreover, we suspect that any reporting error is orthogonal to the fee bump
policy. (iv) The majority of our variation in Medicaid reimbursement rates occurred over a
relatively short period of time (two years) and the policy was temporary for many states, thus the
effects we observe may not reflect the effects of a permanent policy.
Overall, our findings provide evidence that increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for
primary care services can substantially increase behavioral health outcomes among lower income
populations. While the costs of the federal Medicaid fee bump were non-trivial -- $7B to $12B
over a two year period (Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission 2015)) -- given
the enormous social costs of behavioral health, estimated to be as high as $1.31T per year in the
U.S. (Caulkins, Kasunic et al. 2014, Insel 2015) and the current opioid epidemic that leads to 116

30

deaths per day (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017), our findings provide
suggestive evidence that this policy was potentially worthwhile financially. 26

27

Indeed, at the

time of writing, both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate had advanced legislation
designed to mitigate harms associated with the opioid epidemic (Kaiser Family Foundation
2018). While we do not study opioids directly, our results suggest that financially incentivizing
primary care physicians to treat Medicaid enrollees, who are at elevated risk for OUD (Center for
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017), may be a potential policy alternative.

26

The original numbers ($467B in 2012 dollars for mental illness and $711B for substance use [alcohol,
psychoactive drugs, and tobacco] in 2011) were inflated to 2018 dollars using the Consumer Price Index by the
authors.
27
We acknowledge that we are not incorporating the full costs of treatment which extend beyond enhanced funding
to physicians (e.g., facility fees, medications) which Medicaid finances with some cost-sharing by patients.

Notes: The unit of observation is the individual-state-year. All models estimated with a Poisson model and control
for individual characteristics, state characteristics, and state, month, and year fixed effects. Beta coefficients are
converted to average marginal effects. NSDUH sample weights applied. Standard errors clustered around the state
and reported in parentheses. Outpatient visits are not collected in the NSDUH until 2013 and the mean value for
this variable is for the period 2013-2016. Observations are rounded to the nearest 100. Interpreting effect
sizes: Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio is the effect of going from 57.16% Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement
ratio to 100%.

Notes: Calculations based on Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratios for select primary care services
targeted by the Medicaid fee bump policy collected from various sources. Tennessee is excluded because it does not
have a fee-for-service component to its Medicaid program. See associated text for more details on calculations and
data sources. Large fee bump state = increase in the Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement rate > 30% (median
increase in the sample).
