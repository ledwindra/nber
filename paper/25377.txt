ABSTRACT
A large literature has documented links between harmful early life exposures and later life health
and socioeconomic deficits. These studies, however, are typically unable to examine the
possibility that these shocks are transmitted to the next generation. Our study traces the impacts
of in utero exposure to the 1918 influenza pandemic on the outcomes of the children and
grandchildren of those affected using representative survey data from the US. We find evidence
of multigenerational effects on educational, economic, and health outcomes.

Introduction
Understanding persistent poverty and poor life outcomes has posed significant challenges for
social science theories as well as crafting policy responses. Of particular interest is the so called
“long arm” of childhood circumstances, where events and conditions early in an individual’s life
(even in utero) may set in motion an accumulation of disadvantage. The Developmental Origins
of Health and Disease theory (often referred to as the Barker hypothesis) suggests that in utero
insults program the fetus in ways that lead to maladaptive responses to the environment that
persist throughout the life course and explain poor long term outcomes (Barker 2007). However,
since the likelihood of experiencing an early insult is related to parental circumstances, there is
an empirical challenge to causally examining the impacts of early insults. This issue ties into a
key question of whether intergenerational persistence in poor outcomes may stem in part from
genetic mechanisms that may be more resistant to policy efforts. In order to separate potential
channels, some research has focused on exogenous (i.e. unrelated to genetics) health shocks
during early life to explore long term outcomes.
Indeed, a strong causal link between harmful early life / in utero shocks and lowered later
life health and economic outcomes has been found in a number of clearly identified empirical
studies. In addition to separating genetic and non-genetic mechanisms, many of these
investigations are also able to uncover biological (i.e. fetal programming) explanations by
studying specific insults, including the effects of prenatal nutritional status and exposure to
infectious disease. Without the use of experimental (i.e. animal model) research designs, these
studies use so-called quasi-experimental designs by leveraging striking demographic events such
as the Dutch famine and the 1918 flu pandemic (Almond 2006; Lindeboom et al. 2010). The

1

results generally suggest large, lifelong impacts of in utero insults on economic and health
outcomes.
With these results established, a next question is whether they might persist into the
outcomes of future generations. We explore the question of intergenerational persistence of fetal
insults by extending previous work that uses the 1918 influenza pandemic as a natural
experiment (Almond 2006) by adding multigenerational data. We document that in utero
exposure to the pandemic can be seen in the educational attainments of multiple generations.
More specifically, we find a reduction of approximately 1/10th a year of schooling (statistically
insignificant) for the first generation, 1/5th a year of schooling for the second generation, and
1/6th of a year of schooling for the third generation.1 We also show large effects on economic as
well as health outcomes for the second generation. Our findings suggest the importance of in
utero health insults that persist across multiple generations and allow a shift in our analytical
frame from the “long arm of childhood circumstances” to the “long arm of previous generation’s
circumstances,” or, alternatively, “the long reach of history” (Kuzawa and Eisenberg 2014). Our
results can also be interpreted in the context of assessing benefits of policy and environmental
conditions that reduce the likelihood of in utero health insults, where the full benefits may unfold
over multiple generations.
Background Literature
Our research intersects several related literatures. There is a large literature that
documents associations between early life insults and later life outcomes, following the original

1

As mentioned in greater detail in 3.1, the first generation is comprised of the parents from the Wisconsin
Longitudinal Study (WLS). This is the generation that is treated, or exposed in utero to the 1918 flu
epidemic. The second generation is the WLS graduates and siblings, who are the focus of the WLS, and
the third generation is comprised of the offspring of the WLS graduates and siblings.
2

Barker Hypothesis. In addition, we draw on literature that explores multigenerational linkages of
environmental exposures on life course outcomes. These literatures are rarely unified in a single
analysis, largely due to data constraints. We overcome these limitations by leveraging a threegenerational dataset that coincides with a key demographic event from the early 20th century—
the 1918/1919 influenza epidemic.
The seminal work of the economist Douglas Almond (2006) was one of the first papers to
exploit the 1918 flu pandemic as a natural experiment and to test whether in utero exposure to
infectious disease influences later life outcomes. Using US census microdata to situate
respondent births in both time (birth quarter) and place (exploiting geographic variation in the
severity of the flu), Almond (2006) finds evidence of lower educational attainment, higher rates
of physical disability, as well as lower income and socioeconomic status for cohorts exposed to
the 1918/1919 flu while in utero (estimated using birth quarter, age, and timing of the flu) as
compared to unexposed adjacent cohorts. In a related paper, Almond and Mazumder (2005), use
a similar approach with the Survey of Income and Program Participation and find negative health
effects for adults who were in utero (based on birth quarter) during the outbreak. Subsequent
work has built on these outcomes, finding excess cardiovascular disease (Mazumder et al. 2010);
increased likelihood of kidney disease, diabetes, circulatory, and respiratory problems in old age
(Lin and Liu 2014); and increased old-age mortality in non-cancer related causes (Myrskylä et al.
2013).2 More broadly, the negative effect from the flu dovetails with other negative in utero
shocks; see for example, Catalano et al. (2011), Roseboom et al. (2001), Schulz (2010), and
Torche (2011).

Though Cohen (2010) and Fletcher (2014) found no effects on overall mortality.

The mechanisms underlying these broad effects from in utero influenza exposure are not
fully understood in humans. However, in studies of monkeys (Kobasa et al. 2007) and mice
(Kash et al. 2006), it has been shown that the reconstructed 1918 flu virus triggers an
exceptionally intense and prolonged innate immune response. More specifically, gene-expression
analysis shows that proteins involved in the innate immune system have a higher and sustained
expression when triggered by the 1918 reconstructed virus than when triggered by the
contemporary flu of the same H1N1-type (Kobasa et al. 2007). While the specific 1918 flu strain
cannot be studied in humans through purposeful exposure for ethical reasons, both animal and
human studies have linked the maternal immune response during severe flu infection in
pregnancy to offspring brain development as well as impaired adult behavior and cognitive
outcomes (Brown and Derkits 2010; Canetta and Brown 2012; Fatemi et al. 2002; Li et al. 2014;
Miller et al. 2013). These results align with research in psychology that links inflammatory
processes in mothers—including stress and infection, as well as stress-induced
immunosuppression—to poor birth outcomes (for a review, see Schetter 2011). Recent evidence
suggests that in utero exposure to the 1918 flu may not only affect adult outcomes, but also the
outcomes of subsequent generations. Richter and Robling (2015) were the first to identify an
effect of first generation prenatal exposure (using birth trimester) to the 1918 flu pandemic on
the outcomes of the second generation (the children of those exposed to the 1918 flu in utero).
The authors use historical influenza morbidity data matched to birth information to identify
potential exposure to the 1918 flu and find that first generation maternal in utero exposure in the
second trimester lowers educational attainment for female children by 2-2.5 months, or by 1.51.8 percent, but find no such effect for male children. An analogous result is identified for first
generation paternal exposure and male outcomes; that is, first generation exposure in the second

4

trimester lowers educational attainment for male children by 2.4 to 3 months, or by 1.8-2.2
percent, but paternal exposure showed no such effect for females. Taken together, first
generation exposure to the 1918 flu while in utero results in 2 to 3 months less schooling for the
second generation.
Several pathways exist for the intergenerational transmission of early life health shocks.
Through socioeconomic channels, intergenerational persistence in poor outcomes could occur
when a fetally insulted parent, marred by poorer health and socioeconomic outcomes, raises a
child in a low-resource environment. Biologically, phenotype-to-phenotype transmission and
epigenetic inheritance are hypothesized to be key mechanisms for intergenerational transmission
(Kuzawa and Eisenberg 2014). In cases of in utero or very early life shocks, phenotype-tophenotype transmission impacts the outcomes of the next generation through changes in parental
biological systems that lead to altered gestational and/or lactation environments for offspring
(e.g. pre-pregnancy hypertension is linked to low birthweight). Importantly, socioeconomic and
biological channels are not mutually exclusive and can also interact with one another; that is, the
effects of adult phenotype on offspring extend beyond physiology and metabolism to include
parental behavior/environmental response as a potential source of phenotypic transmission and
potentially even cumulative intergenerational phenotypic change (Benyshek 2013). For example,
stress experienced by a mother prenatally may alter stress regulation in offspring, which may in
turn increase risk for the same adult phenotype in the offspring as well as in subsequent
generations. Epigenetic inheritance, in comparison, occurs when parental experiences alter gene
expression that is subsequently transmitted to offspring and future generations through the germ
line. Here, again, there is an opportunity for socioeconomic circumstances to interact with
biology—e.g. where poverty, through the experience of stress, alters gene expression for
5

generations. Our analysis of second generation outcomes will explore some of these channels
but not attempt to prioritize one over another.
Work extending effects of in utero exposure to the 1918 flu to the third generation (the
grandchildren of those originally exposed in utero) in humans, to the best of the authors’
knowledge, does not exist. The strongest evidence for a potential biological channel across
multiple generations comes from studies of historical data from Överkalix region in Northern
Sweden that exploit variance in first generation grandparental food supply during childhood.
Bygren et al. (2001), for example, find that an excess of food during the period just before
adolescence, a time labeled the “slow growth period” (SGP), shortens the grandson’s longevity.
A later study using the Överkalix data replicates the results of Bygren et al. (2001) in a second
cohort, and further extends the results to include an association between first generation paternal
grandmother’s food supply and granddaughter’s mortality risk (Pembrey et al. 2006).3
Our work builds off of this evidence to conduct novel examinations of multigenerational
effects of in utero exposures in human populations. The current research leverages a unique
survey to measure the multigenerational impacts of in utero exposure to the 1918 flu pandemic.
Our hypothesis is that the previously documented direct effects of such shocks extend into the
outcomes of the second generation. Going further, we also estimate whether these effects
continue into the third generation. In other words, we ask whether the singular in utero shock has
a multigenerational effect--on the adult outcomes of those exposed in utero, on their children,

externally validated the potential for transmission across three generations by analyzing the impact of
the German famine of 1916-1918 on the mental health outcomes (an index from survey questions
accounting for ’general mental health’, ’emotional functioning’, ’social functioning’ and ’vitality’) of the
children and grandchildren of those exposed to the famine during their SGP. The authors find that
paternal (maternal) grandfather (grandmothers) exposure during their SGP is associated with better
mental health in grandsons (granddaughters).

Data and Empirical Methodology
Data
In order to examine multigenerational effects of an in utero exposure, we require
multigenerational data. Very few datasets in the US have a multigenerational component and fit
the relevant time period for our exposure (i.e. birth cohorts around 1918). Our data come from
the Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey (WLS), which is a random one-third survey of graduating
high school seniors in Wisconsin in 1957. The majority of these respondents were born in 1939
and form our second generation. Thus, the parents of the WLS graduates form our first
generation, with birth years overlapping the 1918/1919 in utero exposure period. This allows for
the creation of our primary measure for in utero exposure to the 1918 flu epidemic: an indicator
for either first generation parent being born during the 1918-1919 range.4,5 Additional data are

4

Parent year of birth is recorded from the WLS graduates. This self-reported measure is used to create
the indicator of flu exposure: those parents born in 1918 or 1919. To maximize sample size, we use
differing waves of the WLS and reported birth years from biological siblings to supplement the reported
year of birth from WLS graduates. Parent birth years are first collected for the 1992/93 graduate wave.
Missing observations are then sequentially added from graduate reports in later waves—2003 and 2011.
After using all graduate reported year of parent birth variables, observations are then filled in from
identically reported measures from a selected biological sibling.
Specifically, for mothers (gen 1 females), 7,976 observations come from graduates in the 1992/93
wave, 366 additional observations come from the 2003/05 wave, 84 observations come from 2011 wave,
and 68 observations come from the selected sibling. This leaves a base sample size of 8,494, ~94% of
which is from the graduate reported 1992/93 wave. For fathers (gen 1 males), 7,929 observations come
from graduates in the 1992/93 wave, 361 additional observations come from the 2003/05 wave, 77 come
from the 2011 wave, and 91 observations come from siblings, leaving a base sample size of 8,458 (again,
~94% is from the grad reported 1992/93 wave).
From this base, 7 observations are dropped for gen-1-female’s (WLS mother’s) year of birth due
to reported gen 2’s year of birth being 10 or less years after gen 1’s year of birth; 45 additional
observations are lost if this threshold is increased to 15 years. For gen-1-male’s year of birth, 2
observations are removed for identical reasons; this increases to 25 additional observations for the 15 year
threshold. We attribute this reduction in the sample mostly to measurement error.

The 1918 flu epidemic in Wisconsin was from September 1918 through December 1918, but did not
reach the severity experienced in many other states. According to historical records, Wisconsin had the
fourth lowest numbers of deaths out of 25 reporting states (Burg 2000, Shors and McFadden 2009).

collected on the later life outcomes of the WLS graduates and a selected sibling, as well as a
limited number of outcomes for the children (third generation) of the graduates/siblings,
providing the structure for our multigenerational analysis.
Summary statistics are presented in table 1. As shown, approximately 10 percent of WLS
parents are born in either 1918 or 1919. On average fathers are born in 1907 and mothers are
born in 1911; consequently, a birth year of 1918 or 1919 is closer to the right-tail of the
distribution of births and the rate of 10 percent is driven primarily by relatively young mother
exposures.6 Since WLS graduate’s fathers tend to be on average 4 years older than mothers, this
right-tail problem is larger for generation 1 males. This is seen in Figure 1. While not the
primary focus of the WLS data collection, several parental (first generation) outcomes are
available, including years of schooling, occupational prestige, and family socioeconomic status
in 1957.7
[insert table 1 here]
The primary focus of the WLS data collection is high school seniors in 1957 Wisconsin,
the second generation of our study. Given this focus on graduates (and their siblings), a large
number of economic and health variables are available in each wave of the WLS (irregular
intervals roughly 10-15 years apart: 1975/77, 1992/93/94, 2003-2005/2004-2007, and in 2011).
In addition to examining years of schooling, several additional dependent variables in the second

6

Appendix tables 7 and 8 provide evidence that our results are not driven solely by confounding between
exposure to the influenza pandemic and being young mothers.
7
The index of socioeconomic status is a factor weighted score combining data on father and mother’s
years of schooling, father’s occupational prestige, and average parental income. Replacing this measure
with average parental income (see appendix table 1) does not change the effect of the flu indicator. Job
prestige measures for both mother and father are based on Duncan’s Socioeconomic Index, which is a
measure of job prestige based on income, education, and surveyed perceptions of general social standing
for certain occupations (Duncan 1961).

generation intend to capture broad differences in economic and health well-being.8 These include
income during the peak earning years (i.e., family income collected when graduates are 53 years
of age on average), net worth at initial retirement age (i.e., net worth collected when graduates
are 65 years of age on average), and general indicators of health measured by body mass index
and a count of doctor diagnosed illnesses (both collected in the wave when graduates are age 53
on average). Finally, the WLS data contains information that is collected from the second
generation about the third generation; we focus on years of schooling as the main outcome of
interest.
Empirical Methodology
Our empirical strategy follows that of Almond (2006) by examining harmful effects of being
exposed in utero on later life outcomes. We then extend this analysis by estimating
multigenerational impacts on both the second and third generations. In so doing, the primary
estimating equation is given by the following form:
𝑦"#,% = 𝛽( + 𝛽* (𝑌𝑂𝐵 = 1918/19)#,* + 𝜸𝑻𝒇,𝟏 + 𝜹𝑿𝒊𝒇,𝒈 + 𝜀"#,%

Our primary focus is on the coefficient 𝛽* , which measures the effect of having a
parent/grandparent born in 1918-1919 on a number of outcomes for 𝑖 individuals in 𝑓 families
for generation 𝑔. Parent year of birth time trends and their square are denoted by 𝜸𝑻𝒇,𝟏 ; 𝜹𝑿𝒊𝒇,𝒈
represents generation specific controls; and 𝜀"#,% is representative of a family clustered error
term.

8

We note that our three generations of individuals are drawn from three non-overlapping set of birth
years; the mean birth year for generation 1 is ~1910, generation 2 is ~1940, generation 3 is ~1965. Thus,
since we are performing the analysis separately by generation, we are controlling for much of the timevariation in the meaning of education. We also perform analysis stratified by sex in Appendix Tables 1012, so that we can also control for the differential meaning of education in each generation.
9

For the first generation, we control for birth year and its square, capturing age-specific
trends that are tied to our first-generation outcomes of interest (e.g. years of schooling). For the
analysis of second and third generations, birth years and squares for both first generation parents
are included as controls along with generation-specific controls for sex, age, and birth order.
Our estimation strategy follows an intent to treat design. It is likely that the actual
incidence of flu differed by socioeconomic status and social standing (Mamelund 2006;
Sydenstricker 1931). Our use of year-of-birth, however, avoids potential confounding by SES
because all—both rich and poor—are defined as treated if they are born in one of the two years.
Although avoiding confounders associated with actual disease incidence, this estimation strategy
will underestimate the true effect of flu exposure, lowering the magnitude of our coefficient of
interest.
Results
First Generation
Our initial analysis explores the direct effects of being born during the 1918 Influenza Epidemic.
While health data are sparse for the WLS graduate’s parents (first generation), a number of
economic outcomes are available, especially during the initial sample year of 1957. Table 2
explores the relationship between these economic variables and an indicator for birth during
1918/1919. Columns (1)-(3) of table 2 show the relationship between a WLS graduate’s father
being born during 1918/1919 and the father’s years of schooling, the father’s occupational
prestige, and the family’s index of socioeconomic status in 1957 (i.e. when the first generation
members are approximately 40 years old). While statistically insignificant, a negative association

10

is observed between years of schooling and being born in 1918 or 1919.9 This is carried over into
father’s job prestige in column (2), from which the indicator of in utero exposure to the 1918 flu
is associated with an approximate 0.1 standard deviation decline in the index of occupational
prestige. These effects culminate in column (3), which shows a statistically significant negative
effect of in utero exposure to the flu and later life economic well-being: a 1.3 decline in the SES
index, which corresponds to a decline of roughly 10 percent of a standard deviation. The findings
of table 2 corroborate past studies that show in utero exposure to the 1918 flu led to poorer
economic outcomes later in life (Almond 2006).10
[insert table 2 here]
Mirroring the results for males in the first generation, a negative but statistically
insignificant association is observed between an indicator of birth in 1918/1919 and schooling
for first generation females. This association, however, becomes statistically significant at the 1
percent level for the index of family SES, the coefficient being nearly identical to that of a
male’s in utero exposure to the flu, though it is unclear whether these effects flow from labor
market and/or marriage market sources. The findings of table 2 are extended in table 3, which
explores potential marriage market effects of early life exposure to the flu epidemic.11
Column (1) of table 3 regresses the indicator for male in utero exposure on an identical
measure for spouse’s exposure. Females who were born in 1918/1919 were 5 percentage points
more likely to marry men who were also born during the same period. Furthermore, as shown in

9

First generation years of schooling are reported by the second generation WLS graduates. Measurement
error is likely, which may result in the insignificant coefficients of table 2.
10
Richter and Robling (2013; Table 12) find a similar effect for in utero female exposure to flu in the first
trimester.
11
Mothers and fathers of WLS graduates are assumed to be married.
11

columns (2) and (3), these women were more likely to marry men with fewer years of school and
lower job prestige. These effects are significant at the 1 percent level. Similar effects are seen in
columns (4)-(6) for 1918/1919 born males, who are 14 percentage points more likely to marry flu
exposed females (p=0.00) and marry females with 0.26 fewer years of schooling (p=0.101).
Given the findings of table 3, however, we cannot rule out that this is a marriage market effect.12
[insert table 3 here]
Second Generation
Our hypothesis is that the direct effects observed in tables 2 and 3 extend into future generations.
To address this hypothesis, we regress a number of economic and health outcomes of the WLS
graduates and siblings, the offspring of the first generation examined in tables 2 and 3. These
estimations are performed in tables 4 and 5. Column (1) in both tables focus on an indicator for
either parent being born in 1918/1919; the primary regressor of column (2) is an indicator for
father’s (gen. 1 males) in utero exposure to the 1918 flu; column (3) considers mother’s (gen. 1
females) exposure; and column (4) includes separate indicators for both mother and father’s
exposure. Controls included in all columns include father’s year of birth and its square, mother’s
year of birth and its square, an indicator for sex in the second generation, a measure of birth
order in the second generation, and second-generation year of birth and its square.
Table 4 focuses on economic outcomes of the WLS graduates. To reiterate, our
hypothesis is that in utero exposure to the 1918 influenza pandemic has effects that persist for
multiple generations. Table 2 shows the direct, first generation effects, while table 4 begins to
show the indirect effects that are transmitted to offspring. Panel A regresses years of schooling in

12

Appendix table 2 repeats the estimation of table 3 while also controlling for an indicator of own-flu
exposure and own year of birth measures.
12

the second generation on indicators of first generation exposure to the 1918 flu.13 From column
(1), either parent being born in 1918/1919 is associated with a statistically significant decline of
0.21 years of schooling in the second generation. This estimate is likely understated because the
sampling design of the WLS is a focus on high school seniors; thus, individuals with fewer than
twelve years of schooling are underrepresented in the data.14 Columns (2)-(4) disambiguate this
effect into the maternal and paternal lines. From which, the effect of column (1) seems to be
driven by mother’s in utero exposure to the flu.15
The findings of Panel A are extended into Panel B, which replaces years of schooling as
the dependent variable with the natural log of family income for the 1992 wave, a time when the
second generation respondents are 53 years of age on average and represents a time of peak
earning in the life course. As with years of schooling, a negative association is seen throughout
the specifications of Panel B. Having either parent born in 1918/1919 is associated with a 22
percent decline in family income. Once again, this effect seems to be driven by mother’s, not
father’s, exposure. Panel C replaces income with a measure of net worth for the 2004 wave. This
measure of net worth is when the second generation respondents are on average 65 years of age
and is representative of earnings throughout the life course. The dual indicator of column (1) is
negative but statistically insignificant at conventional levels (p=0.23). When looking at the effect
of mother exposure in column (3), however, the effect becomes statistically significant at the

Appendix Table 6 includes a number of alternative measures for years of schooling in place of the
simple count used in Table 4.
14
Table 3 includes selected siblings of the WLS graduates. These siblings do not have to be high school
graduates.

This finding differs from that of Richter and Robling (2013), who find maternal exposure tied to
daughter outcomes and paternal exposure tied to son outcomes.
13

10% level (p=0.069), implying those with mothers born during 1918/1919 have approximately
$36,000 less in net worth by 2004.
Following the broader health focus of the Barker hypothesis, the economic effects of
table 4 are replaced with health measures in table 5. We consider three broad measures of
general health and well-being later in life: self-reported health in later life (~53 years old),
height, and BMI (again at ~53). The use of self-reported health is intended to capture general
well-being later in life; this is tested in Panel A of table 5. Mazumder et al. (2010) provide
evidence that in utero exposure to the 1918 flu is associated with a reduction in height and an
increase cardiovascular disease, so it is possible that these negative health outcomes could be
transmitted to offspring; this is tested in Panel B of table 5.16 And given prior work linking
early life exposure to the Dutch famine to BMI (Stein et al. 2007) and metabolic function
(Lumey et al. 2009) in adulthood, as well as the fact that both the Dutch famine and the 1918 flu
impacted maternal stress and nutritional status,17 we examine BMI as another broad indicator of
health for the second generation; this is tested in Panel C of table 5. A consistent pattern
emerges across all panels. Like SES outcomes in table 4, gen. 1 female exposure to the flu is
shown to have negative, statistically significant association with all health outcomes in the
second generation.
From Panel A, parental—or gen. 1—flu exposure reduces self-reported health by roughly
half a point (p<0.05) on a Likert scale from 1-5; 1 being very poor health and 5 being excellent

16

Appendix Table 14 tests indicators for a number self-reported health conditions. As shown, a weak
positive association is shown between gen. 1 female flu exposure and an indicator of cardiovascular
disease during the 1992/93 wave of the WLS (Appendix Table 15A). This association, however, reduced
in magnitude and statistical significance for later-life waves of the WLS (Appendix Table 15B and 15C).

health. As shown and like prior estimates, this effect is driven by gen. 1 female exposure. For
adult height, gen. 1 female exposure is associated with a reduction of about 0.2 inches (p<0.10),
which is larger than the direct effect documented by Mazumder et al. (2010). of 0.05 inches;
however, Mazumder et al.’s (2010) estimated effect falls within the 95% confidence interval of
our estimated coefficient. Panel C considers the effect on second generation BMI. From column
(1), having either parent being born in 1918/1919 is associated with a statistically significant
increase in the offspring’s BMI of 0.41 points. As with the economic effects of table 4, this
increase in BMI appears to be driven by mother’s exposure. This is seen in columns (2)-(4),
which estimate a statistically significant positive coefficient for mother’s exposure but a
coefficient that is statistically indistinguishable from zero for father’s exposure.
A persistent effect of in utero exposure to the 1918 Flu is seen in tables 4 and 5. First
generation exposure consistently has a statistically significant and economically meaningful
effect on second generation health and economic outcomes. And this effect appears to be driven
solely by mother’s exposure; although, due to marriage market associations, we cannot
determine definitively that mother’s exposure produces this multigenerational effect through
biological mechanisms.
Appendix Tables 10A-11G re-estimate Tables 4 and 5, splitting the sample by generation
2’s sex. In short, the negative effects of first generation exposure appear to be more prominent
in second generation males; such that, the harmful multi-generational effects are most prominent
in second generation men whose mothers were exposed to the 1918 flu.18 Potential reasons for
18

When omitting those with no family income during the 1992 wave of the WLS, negative effects from
gen. 1 female flu exposure are primarily seen in second generation males. This indicates, however, that
there is a greater frequency of no income amongst second generation females from gen. 1 flu exposure.
Additionally, when looking at net worth in the 2011 wave of the WLS, we see no difference by gen. 2’s
sex.
15

this sex disparity could be tied to general trends in the differences between sons and daughters in
intergenerational mobility (Chadwick and Solon 2002). In other words, sons are more likely to
inherit their families SES standing than daughters. This implies that the negative gen. 1 shock
from in utero exposure is more likely to affect sons through the proposed SES channel than
daughters, resulting in a larger estimated effect for gen. 2 males. Furthermore, there appears to
be a growing gap between in the intergenerational elastiticy between sons and daughters during
the time period in question (Olivetti and Paserman 2015). Another potential reason for the sex
difference could be the larger standard deviation in gen. 2 male outcomes; this is shown in
Appendix Table 9. Finally, the findings of Appendix Tables 10A-11G differ from Richter and
Robling (2015), who show homogeneous sex effects from in utero flu exposure for education:
gen. 1 female exposure led to reduction in gen. 2 female education, and gen. 1 male exposure is
associated with gen. 2 male education. Given this disparity between the two studies, our underrepresentation for gen. 1 male exposure, and the mixed findings in Tables 10A-11G, we view our
general finding of gen. 1 female exposure working through gen. 2 male outcomes as preliminary
and suggestive. Indeed, as we test in Appendix Tables 12A-12G, the sex differences in gen. 2 are
often not statistically significant.
Third Generation
As mentioned previously, the focus of the WLS data collection is high school graduates in 1957,
but additional samples have been collected for a number of variables on the children of these
graduates. Table 6 explores the effects of the WLS parents on the years of schooling for WLS
children, estimating the effect of flu exposure across three generations.19

19

Analysis of the WLS grad/sibling children (i.e. the third generation) restricts the sample to those
children that are biological children and that are 35 years of age and older by the 2003/2004 wave of the
WLS.
16

Consistent with the second-generation estimations, a persistent effect of the in utero flu
exposure is observed, and this effect seems to be driven by grandmother exposure (gen. 1
female). The joint indicator for either parent is negative and close to statistical significance at
the 10 percent level (p=0.106), suggesting that exposure in the first generation is associated with
0.12 years of schooling less in the third generation. The effect of grandfather exposure is
insignificantly different from zero, while the coefficient of grandmother exposure is similar in
magnitude to the joint estimate of column (1) while being statistically significant at the 10%
level (p=0.066). Furthermore, the decline in schooling seen in the third generation is similar, but
slightly smaller in magnitude compared to the second generation effects seen in Panel A of table
4.20 This again indicates a persistent effect that may be attenuating over time. Importantly, while
the estimate for grandfather exposure is insignificant, it is consistent with intergenerational
inheritance (Kuzawa and Eisenberg 2014). To say the same for grandmother exposure would
require effects to persist into the fourth generation (due to the differences in gametic
development), and this data is not available in the WLS.
Conclusion
This paper presents novel evidence of multigenerational effects of in utero health insults. We
use the sudden and unexpected influenza pandemic in 1918/1919 to trace out the effects of in
utero exposure to infectious disease on own outcomes for the first generation, children’s
outcomes, and grandchildren’s outcomes. We find that this exposure reduces educational
attainment and related economic outcomes across three generations. For example, individuals in

20

For gen. 1 female exposure in column (4), the p-value for a difference in coefficients between Panel A
of Table 4 and Table 6 is 0.411, implying the effect in the third generation is statistically indistinguishable
from that in the second generation.
17

our second generation, the WLS graduates and their siblings who have mothers who were
exposed to the 1918 flu in utero, complete 1/5 fewer years of schooling (or 2.4 months less
schooling). The size of our estimated effect aligns well with those of Richter and Robling (2015)
who find that first generation in utero exposure to the 1918 flu results in 1/6 fewer years of
schooling (or 2 months to 2.5 months less schooling) for the maternal line. We then extend
results to the third generation for the first time in the literature and find that individuals in the
third generation, who have grandmothers who were exposed to the pandemic in utero, complete
1/7 fewer years of schooling (or 1.7 months less schooling) than individuals without affected
grandmothers.
There are at several potential mechanisms for the persistence of poor outcomes across
three generations we find in our data. As previously outlined, the intergenerational persistence in
poor outcomes due to early life health shocks could occur through socioeconomic channels,
where a fetally insulted person with resulting low educational attainment raises a child in a lowresource environment that reduces opportunities for high educational attainment of the child. In
order to see multigenerational effects, the reduced opportunities for high educational attainment
of the child must then reduce opportunities for their own children. Alternatively,
intergenerational transmission may occur through epigenetic inheritance through the germ line, a
distinct possibility based on findings of the Överkalix studies, or phenotype-to-phenotype
transmission and cumulative intergenerational phenotypic change.
Our analysis is unable to fully distinguish between these proposed intergenerational
channels, the socioeconomic and biological, but it is important to note that the channels are by no
means mutually exclusive. Further analysis (appendix tables 3-5) that is intended to partially
account for the socioeconomic mechanism leads to mixed results in which the coefficient of first
18

generation flu exposure is attenuated to insignificance for some outcomes but not others. This
provides evidence for a socioeconomic channel but does not eliminate the possibility of
epigenetic mechanisms or other biological channel through which socioeconomic status “gets
under the skin” to influence outcomes of subsequent generations (e.g. the socioeconomic
circumstances of one generation may “get under the skin” of the next and subsequently be passed
via biology and/or socioeconomics to other generations). Likewise, the estimates of grandfather
effects on grandchildren are imprecise but consistent with transgenerational inheritance (Kuzawa
and Eisenberg 2014). Additionally, while the WLS provides a unique framework to analyze
multiple generations, the measurement of flu exposure is somewhat crude (from self-reported
parents’ year of birth) and is in the right-tail of the distribution of parent birth years, suggesting
the possibility of confounding from resource-poor younger mothers.21 That is, exposure to
influenza in the first generation is mechanically tied to mother’s ages of 20 and 21 because the
WLS sample is drawn based on having a child who was born in 1939 (and thus graduating high
school in 1957). While we cannot definitively separate these two effects, our ability to compare
outcomes of slightly older mothers (ages 22 and 23, born in 1917 or 1916) provide evidence
more consistent with in utero exposure to influenza than impacts of having a mother who is
20/21 years old.
From a policy perspective, our evidence may suggest a novel source of multigenerational
persistence in poverty through biosocial factors and suggest a need to consider evidence of
transgenerational social and/or biological mechanisms. We document the extent to which

21

We specifically explore the confounding effects of younger mothers in appendix tables 7 and 8. These
tables show that younger mothers are indeed initially disadvantaged (i.e. less years of schooling);
however, this young-mother disadvantage does not persist in subsequent generations. Rather, only those
mothers born in the 1918-1919 range have significant negative effects on later generations.
19

harmful early life environments cascade through generations, promoting a disadvantaged start for
those whose grandparents exposed to a hazardous early life environment.

Summary & Notes: This table provides summary statistics for all variables used. The samples above may not be
representative for all estimations. For example, the inclusion of siblings in the second generation increase the sample of parental
year of birth and the corresponding flu indicator. This increase in sample does not significantly change the sample statistics
above. Similar sample changes occur for the second generation controls above. For the third generation, the sample is restricted
to biological children over 35 years of age.

Ind. for First Gen. Flu Exposure (Female)

Summary & Notes: This table provides evidence of harmful effects of flu exposure in the first generation on second
generation health outcomes. First generation time trends are given by year of birth and its square for both WLS parents (i.e.,
gen.1 males and females). Second generation controls inlcude an indicator for sex, second generation year of birth and its
square, and birth order. All estimation is performed with OLS with family clustered standard errors reported in parenthesis.
Statistical significance is denoted by *, **, and ***, representing significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.

Summary & Notes: This table shows that the generational effects of flu exposure extend into the third generation of the
WLS. First generation flu exposure is shown to have a negative association with third generation years of schooling. First
generation time trends are year of birth measures for each parent and their square. Second generation controls inlcude an
indicator for sex, second generation year of birth and its square, and birth order. Third generation controls include a sex
indicator, year of birth and its square, and birth order. Given the focus on years of schooling, the sample is restricted to those
third generation individuals 35 years of age and older, or born during or before 1970 (data were collected in 2005). All
estimation is performed with OLS with family (second generation) clustered standard errors reported in parenthesis. Statistical
significance is denoted by *, **, and ***, representing significance at the 10, 5, and 1% levels, respectively.
