    "abstract": "\n\nThe U.S. economic expansion since 2009 is the longest on record since 1854, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research Business Cycle Dating Committee. This paper seeks to understand this phenomenon better by looking at the time paths of popular narratives over this interval, of stories that people have been telling that offer clues into their economic behavior. Six constellations of narratives are studied, identified by keywords \u201cGreat Depression,\u201d \u201csecular stagnation,\u201d \u201csustainability,\u201d \u201chousing bubble,\u201d \u201cstrong economy,\u201d and \u201csave more.\u201d\n\n",
