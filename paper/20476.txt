Strategic News Releases in Equity Vesting Months

NBER Working Paper No. 20476
September 2014
JEL No. G14,G34
ABSTRACT
We show that CEOs strategically time corporate news releases to coincide with months in which their
equity vests. These vesting months are determined by equity grants made several years prior, and thus
unlikely driven by the current information environment. CEOs reallocate news into vesting months,
and away from prior and subsequent months. They release 5% more discretionary news in vesting
months than prior months, but there is no difference for non-discretionary news. These news releases
lead to favourable media coverage, suggesting they are positive in tone. They also generate a temporary
run-up in stock prices and market liquidity, potentially resulting from increased investor attention
or reduced information asymmetry. The CEO takes advantage of these effects by cashing out shortly
after the news releases.

Introduction

The timely release of information is central to the efficiency of both financial markets and the
real economy. Information can influence real decisions either directly, or indirectly via affecting
stock prices which agents use as signals (see the survey of Bond, Edmans, and Goldstein (2012)).
For example, suppliers, employees, and investors may base their decision of whether to initiate,
continue, or terminate their relationship with a firm on news releases, or stock prices that are
affected by news.1
News can also have distributional as well as efficiency effects. In particular, news reduces
information asymmetry between investors, thus protecting uninformed investors from trading losses.
Indeed, Regulation FD aims to “level the playing field” between investors by restricting selective
disclosure. Moreover, these distributional consequences in the secondary market may feed back into
efficiency consequences in the primary market. Uninformed investors, who expect future trading
losses due to information asymmetry, may withdraw from the market (Bhattacharya and Spiegel
(1991)) or require a higher cost of capital (Diamond and Verrecchia (1991)), in turn hindering
investment.
Timely information flows are thus important. Subsequent to Regulation FD in October 2000
and Sarbanes-Oxley in July 2002, corporate news releases have been particularly important in
communicating new information to investors (Neuhierl, Scherbina, and Schlusche (2013)). News
releases do not occur mechanically whenever corporate events take place, but are a discretionary
decision of the CEO. This paper investigates whether CEOs strategically time news releases for
personal gain. Specifically, we hypothesize that a CEO who intends to sell equity in a given month
will delay otherwise past news releases until that month, and accelerate otherwise future news
releases into that month. This is because disclosure can temporarily boost the stock price through
two channels. First, disclosure can attract investor attention. Barber and Odean (2008) argue
that investors need to browse through thousands of stocks when making a buy decision, and so
1
Moreover, real decisions may be affected not only by specific releases of information, but also the general
informativeness of stock prices. For example, Faure-Grimaud and Gromb (2004) show that a blockholder will base
her decision to undertake a costly intervention on whether the benefits of this intervention will be reflected in prices
within her investment horizon.

are particularly likely to buy attention-grabbing stocks. They indeed find that retail investors
are net buyers of such stocks, and Da, Engelberg, and Gao (2011) show that such buying leads to
temporary price increases. Second, disclosure can reduce information asymmetry between investors,
encouraging uninformed investors to buy the stock and raising its price. Indeed, Balakrishnan,
Billings, Kelly, and Ljungqvist (2014) find that voluntary disclosures increase liquidity and thus
firm value. Separately, in addition to releasing a greater volume of news, the CEO may also release
more favorable news.
However, documenting that CEOs disclose more (favorable) news in months in which they sell
equity would not imply a causal relationship from equity sales to disclosure, because the decision to
sell equity is endogenous. For example, if a particular month happens to coincide with many favorable events, the CEO will undertake many positive news releases (even in the absence of strategic
considerations) and take advantage of any resulting stock price increase by opportunistically selling
equity. Thus, disclosure causes equity sales rather than expected equity sales causing disclosure.
We identify a CEO’s likelihood of selling equity in a given month by whether he has stock
or options scheduled to vest in that month. These “vesting months” depend on the timing and
vesting schedule of equity grants made several years prior2 , and thus are unlikely to be affected by
the current information environment. It is unlikely that boards can forecast, to the exact month,
when news is most likely to be released several years in the future. We identify vesting months
between 2006 and 2011 using a new dataset from Equilar, and hand-collect it from proxy statements
and SEC Form 4 filings from 1994 to 2005.
We find that CEOs are likely to sell equity shortly after it vests, consistent with the optimal
exercise behavior of an undiversified agent (e.g., Kahl, Liu, and Longstaff (2003) and Hall and
Murphy (2002)). Controlling for CEOs’ unvested and vested equity and other determinants of
equity sales, they are 23% (14%) more likely to sell shares in months in which their stock (options)
vest, compared to non-vesting months. Thus, scheduled vesting of equity indeed leads to equity
sales and thus short-term stock price concerns.
2

The average vesting horizon in our sample is three years, with a maximum of seven years.

We use novel data from Capital IQ’s Key Developments database as our source for news releases. Unlike other news sources such as Factiva, LexisNexis, and Dow Jones Newswires, this
database filters the data to eliminate duplicates and extraneous information, and classifies news
into categories. This allows us to stratify the releases into discretionary news (the timing of which
is likely to be under the CEO’s control, such as conferences, client and product announcements, and
special dividends) and non-discretionary news (such as earnings announcements or annual general
meetings (“AGMs”)). Capital IQ also allows us to filter the news by source, thus enabling us to
focus on news released by the firm, rather than the media.
We show that firms release significantly more discretionary news in vesting months than in
non-vesting months, controlling for other determinants of news releases, such as months in which
there is an earnings announcement, AGM or board meeting, analyst coverage, and unvested and
vested equity. Firms also significantly reduce disclosures in the months before and after the vesting
month. There are 2% more discretionary news releases in vesting months than non-vesting months,
and 5% more than in prior months. The value of vesting equity is also significantly associated
with the number of news releases. In contrast, the amount of non-discretionary news releases is no
different between vesting and non-vesting months. These results are robust to removing out-of-themoney options, which are unlikely to be exercised upon vesting, and equity with performance-based
vesting provisions, which may not vest if performance thresholds have not been met.
We then examine the positivity of news releases by studying the tone of media coverage immediately afterwards. Textual analysis from Thomson Reuters News Analytics indicates that media
articles after discretionary news releases are more favorable in vesting months than non-vesting
months, suggesting that the CEO releases more favorable discretionary news in vesting months.
There is no difference in the tone of media coverage following non-discretionary news.
Next, we study the effect of news releases on stock returns and trading volume to verify whether
they indeed improve the conditions for equity sales. The disclosure of one discretionary news item
in a vesting month generates a significant 16-day abnormal return of 28 basis points (“bps”). The
31-day return is smaller (14 bps), suggesting a temporary attention boost.

4

The average CEO equity sale is 6.2% of the average daily trading volume. Thus, the CEO may
benefit from not only the higher price that results from disclosure, but also any increased liquidity.
On the first day after a discretionary news release, abnormal trading volume rises by 0.32% of
shares outstanding, compared to the mean of 0.22%. This value decreases over time, consistent
with an attention story. The CEO’s average equity sale (on a sale day) represents 0.165% of shares
outstanding. Thus, the abnormal trading volume generated by the news releases, which is nearly
double, can provide adequate camouflage.
The final step is to show that CEOs indeed take advantage of the observed short-term runups in stock price and trading volume. We find that the median interval between a discretionary
disclosure in a vesting month and the first equity sale by a CEO is 5 days, and the median interval
until the CEO sells the entire vesting amount is 7 days.
Our paper is mainly related to two literatures: corporate disclosures and equity vesting. Starting
with the former, several papers examine the relation between disclosure and equity incentives
(Penman (1982), Noe (1999), Nagar, Nanda, and Wysocki (2003), Cheng and Lo (2006), and
Brockman, Khurana, and Martin (2008)). These studies investigate standard measures of incentives
which are likely to be endogenous to the information environment. Other papers study disclosure
incentives that stem from channels other than the CEO’s contract. In Balakrishnan, Billings, Kelly,
and Ljungqvist (2014), exogenous broker closures or mergers reduce public information and thus
increase managers’ incentives to disclose in response. Yermack (2014) finds that firms release less
news when the CEO is on vacation and thus disclosures involve particularly high effort. Ahern and
Sosyura (2014) find that bidders in stock mergers with fixed exchange ratios originate significantly
more positive news stories, which improves their stock price and thus merger terms. While the
decision to undertake a stock-financed merger may be driven by the expectation of imminent
positive news releases3 , we study disclosure incentives that result from equity grants made several
years prior. Another difference is that we study the incentives of the CEO in particular, rather than
the firm in general: the news releases in our setting benefit the CEO specifically. While Bebchuk
and Fried (2004) argue that CEOs negotiate higher grant-date pay, we show that CEOs can also
3

Ahern and Sosyura (2014) thus undertake a battery of tests to address alternative explanations for their results.

5

increase the value of their pay upon vesting. For example, applied to the average annual CEO
vesting equity of $5.18 million, the 16-day return of 28 bps translates into a gain of $14,504, in
line with the gains to illegal insider trading. These gains come at little cost: changing the timing
of news releases is legal4 , and involves less effort than other actions to boost the stock price, such
as cutting investment projects. However, while meaningful for the CEO, these gains are small
compared to firm value. Thus, we do not claim to identify a major agency problem between the
CEO and shareholders. The main effect of delaying news releases may be on stakeholders who
made decisions prior to the vesting month with less information, or on the distribution of wealth
between shareholders who traded in prior months.
Other papers study disclosures around option award (rather than vesting) dates. Aboody
and Kasznik (2000) hypothesize that managers who receive scheduled option grants just before
earnings announcements are more likely to have private information than those who receive grants
afterwards. Studying 70 earnings forecasts, they find that the former group is more likely to
issue pessimistic earnings forecasts, which may lower the grant strike price. Daines, McQueen,
and Schonlau (2014) find that before (after) scheduled option grants, management issues negative
(positive) earnings guidance, and 8-K filings of material corporate events exhibit negative (positive)
announcement returns. We study the CEO’s incentives to time news in general, using a sample
of 166,000 news releases that predominantly contains disclosures other than earnings guidance
and 8-K filings, and show how the effect differs across discretionary and non-discretionary news.
Many of these news releases do not have a clear direction (e.g. company conference presentations,
earnings release dates). They thus affect the stock price through a different mechanism than
earnings forecasts or 8-K filings – attracting attention or reducing information asymmetry – and
thus also affect trading volumes. While options have been markedly replaced by stock in recent
4

6

years (Frydman and Jenter (2010)), we show that the CEO’s existing stock as well as option holdings
affect his disclosure incentives.5
The second literature studies the relationship between vesting equity and corporate decisions.
Edmans, Fang, and Lewellen (2014) show that newly-vesting equity is associated with declines in
investment and a greater likelihood of meeting or narrowly beating earnings forecasts. Ladika and
Sautner (2013) show that, in response to the adoption of FAS 123R, some firms chose to accelerate
option vesting, and such accelerated vesting was associated with a reduction in capital expenditure.
While those papers show that newly-vesting equity affects real decisions, we show that it can affect
the information environment, thus linking a corporate finance variable (the CEO’s contract) to
financial markets. Since news releases are much easier to manage than real decisions, disclosure
is arguably the most plausible arena in which short-term concerns will manifest. In addition,
Edmans, Fang, and Lewellen (2014) study the Equilar data, which starts in 2006, while Ladika
and Sautner (2013) use the R.G. Associates Option Accelerated Vester Database, which covers
May 2004 to February 2006. We use the Equilar data from 2006 to 2011, and hand-collect data
from 1994 to 2005. Gopalan, Milbourn, Song, and Thakor (2014) study a different measure of
short-term incentives – the duration (average vesting horizon) of the CEO’s equity holdings. We
do not use duration in our setting as it is endogenous to current equity grants and the decision
to retain previously-vested equity, both of which may be correlated with the current information
environment.
In addition to the literature on short-term incentives in particular, our paper also contributes
to the literature on CEO compensation in general. While this literature is substantial, it is very
difficult to document causal effects. The survey of Frydman and Jenter (2010) notes that “compensation arrangements are the endogenous outcome of a complex process. This makes it extremely
difficult to interpret any observed correlation between executive pay and firm outcomes as evidence
5

Yermack (1997) shows that CEOs can also increase the value of their option grants by influencing their award
dates around pre-scheduled earnings announcements. Options are more likely to be awarded before (after) positive
(negative) earnings surprises. Smukler (2009) documents anecdotal examples of companies releasing negative information shortly after what he assumes to be the vesting dates of options. We have data on actual vesting dates and
conduct a systematic study.

of a causal relationship.” We use a measure of CEO incentives that is unlikely to be driven by the
current contracting environment, allowing us to show that CEO contracts affect behavior.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and Section 3 shows that CEOs
frequently sell equity in vesting months. Section 4 presents our core results, linking the frequency
and positivity of discretionary news releases with equity vesting schedules. Section 5 shows that
news releases lead to short-term increases in stock prices and trading volume, and that the CEO
takes advantage of these increases by selling equity shortly after such releases. Section 6 discusses
robustness tests and Section 7 concludes.

Data and Variable Construction

This section describes the variables used in our analysis. Our goal is to study how disclosure is
affected by the CEO’s concerns for the stock price in a given month. Theoretically, these concerns
will arise if he has equity vesting in that month, because he is likely to sell his vesting equity for
diversification reasons (e.g., Kahl, Liu, and Longstaff (2003) and Hall and Murphy (2002)). We thus
seek to identify these vesting months. Information on vesting schedules is available in SEC Form
4, which must be filed after a stock or option award. For each grant, the Form 4 filing provides the
number of securities granted and the grant date in a standardized table, and vesting information
in a footnote. For example, Form 4 indicates that John H. Eyler, Jr. of Toys “R” Us was awarded
20,000 restricted shares on April 1, 2004. The footnote reads:
“These shares vest 50% on the second anniversary of the award date and 100% on the third
anniversary of the award date.”
We use these footnotes to calculate the number of shares scheduled to vest on each date. Here,
10,000 shares vest on April 1, 2006, and the remaining 10,000 vest on April 1, 2007.
For option grants, a second source of vesting information is SEC proxy statements, which provide
information on all options granted during the year in a format comparable to Form 4. The number
of securities, exercise price, and maturity are in a standardized table, and the vesting schedule is in

8

a footnote. For example, the 2001 proxy filing of IBM states that Louis Gerstner received 650,000
options with an exercise price of $109.62. The footnote reads:
“Mr. Gerstner’s grant becomes exercisable in two equal installments, on March 1, 2001, and on
March 1, 2002.”
Here, 325,000 options vest on March 1, 2001, and the remaining 325,000 vest on March 1, 2002.
In a randomized sample of options, we find that the information quality is higher in proxy
statements than in Form 4 filings, which are not filed regularly and sometimes missing altogether.
Unfortunately, proxy statements do not provide grant-level vesting information on restricted stock,
which would allow identification of vesting months, but only the number of shares vesting in the
current fiscal year as a whole. Therefore, we hand-collect option vesting information from proxy
statements and stock vesting information from Form 4 filings, from 1994 (when SEC filings become
available electronically) to 2005. To make the hand-collection manageable, we restrict our pre-2006
sample to firms that were part of the S&P 500 Index in any year within that period.
For grants starting from 2006-2011, we use the Equilar dataset. Using proxy statements and
Form 4 filings, Equilar provides vesting information for all stock and option grants to executives of
Russell 3000 firms, in a standardized format. For each grant, Equilar records the date and size of the
grant, the vesting period, and whether the grant exhibits cliff vesting (where the entire grant vests
at the end of the vesting period) or graded vesting. Graded vesting means that part of the grant
vests prior to the end of the vesting period, but it is unclear whether it corresponds to straight-line,
back-loaded, or front-loaded vesting. We assume that graded vesting refers to straight-line vesting
on an annual schedule, as most pre-2006 grants with graded vesting vest on this basis.
We use these vesting schedules to create the variable V estingM onth, a dummy variable that
equals one if the CEO has any equity vesting in a given month. We also create V estingSensitivity,
the dollar sensitivity of the vesting securities to a 100% change in the stock price, which takes into
account the amount of vesting equity. To do so, we first calculate the delta of the vesting securities.
We obtain the strike price and maturity date of a given option grant from either the proxy statement
or Equilar. We use this information, together with the average monthly stock return volatility over
the past 12 months, annual dividend yield from CRSP, and the one-month Treasury bill rate as

9

the risk-free rate, to calculate the Black-Scholes delta. We sum across the deltas of all vesting
option grants and add the number of vesting shares (since the delta of a share is 1) to calculate the
aggregate delta of all vesting securities. This delta measures the dollar sensitivity of the vesting
securities to a $1 increase in the stock price. We multiply it by the stock price at prior monthend to form V estingSensitivity. This sensitivity is comparable across firms with different stock
prices and is analogous to the Hall and Liebman (1998) incentive measure, but focuses on vesting
equity rather than the entire equity portfolio. While the delta represents the effective number of
vesting shares, the sensitivity represents their effective value. We use the logarithm of one plus
V estingSensitivity due to significant skewness.
Edmans, Fang, and Lewellen (2014) use V estingSensitivity as their key independent variable,
because they study the link between short-term incentives and investment. Since reductions in
investment lower future firm value and thus the CEO’s unvested equity holdings, the CEO will
trade off the short-term gain from disinvestment with the potential long-term loss. In contrast, it is
less clear that strategically timing news has a substantial effect on long-run firm value; instead, its
main effects are likely to be on other stakeholders or on the distribution of wealth between trading
shareholders. In addition, news timing arguably involves less effort than changing investment plans,
and so it may be that vesting equity of any amount induces the CEO to increase disclosures. We
thus use both V estingM onth and Log(1+V estingSensitivity) as independent variables in different
specifications. Our discussion will primarily concern the V estingM onth results since they are easier
to interpret – in particular, we can compare the amount of news disclosed in vesting versus nonvesting months, and versus the previous and the following month.6
Our identification strategy is that vesting equity causes the CEO to be concerned about the
current stock price, because he is likely to sell vesting equity for diversification reasons. Some
CEOs hold already-vested equity, which could also lead to stock price concerns if they are free to
sell it. However, any association between vested equity and news releases is difficult to interpret
6

Our method of identifying equity vesting also differs from Edmans, Fang, and Lewellen (2014), who study the
actual equity that vests in a given year. By looking at actual vesting ex-post, they do not require the assumption that
graded vesting refers to straight-line vesting. However, their measure is only available on an annual basis, consistent
with their analysis of investment, which is also available on an annual basis. We study the number of news releases
in a given month, which requires us to estimate the number of shares and options that vest in a given month. Thus,
we follow Gopalan, Milbourn, Song, and Thakor (2014) by studying predicted vesting ex-ante.

10

because the CEO’s decision to hold onto vested equity is endogenous – for example, it could
be driven by the anticipation of future positive news releases. In addition, the CEO may face
explicit or implicit constraints on selling his vested equity. These same constraints also support our
identifying assumption that CEOs increase equity sales in vesting months, because vesting relaxes
these constraints. One constraint may result from ownership guidelines set by the board. These
guidelines are typically satisfied only by vested equity (Core and Larcker (2002)), and so vesting
allows the CEO to sell equity without violating the guidelines. Second, the CEO may hold vested
equity voluntarily for control reasons. Since unvested equity does not provide voting rights, vesting
allows additional sales without falling below his desired level of voting rights. Similarly, the CEO
may hold a threshold level of vested equity to signal confidence in the firm. Consistent with these
points, we show in Section 3 that CEOs sell significantly more equity in vesting months, even after
controlling for already-vested equity. Note that our identification does not require the CEO to sell
his entire equity upon vesting, only that vesting months are a significant determinant of equity
sales.
Our main analysis links equity vesting to news releases. We obtain data on news releases
from Capital IQ’s Key Developments database, which starts in 2002. This database consists of
information from over 20,000 public news sources, company press releases, regulatory filings, call
transcripts, investor presentations, stock exchanges, regulatory websites, and company websites.
The database has several attractive features compared to other standard news data sources, such as
Factiva, LexisNexis, and Dow Jones Newswires. First, it pre-filters the data to eliminate duplicates
and extraneous information. This results in a much cleaner dataset which consolidates all the
different sources of a particular news item in a single record. Second, it classifies news releases into
different items, allowing us to stratify them into two main categories. The first is discretionary
news, the timing of which is likely to be under the CEO’s control, such as conferences, client and
product announcements, and special dividends. Non-discretionary news is likely outside the CEO’s
control, such as earnings announcements or AGMs. Appendix B provides the full classification, as
well as the frequency of the different news items, and Appendix C shows examples of Capital IQ
news items for Wal-Mart in the first quarter of 2012. Third, Capital IQ allows us to filter the news

11

by source. We exclude news released by the media, and retain only news items generated from
within the firm: those whose sources are company websites, newswires that disseminate corporate
press releases (e.g. Business Wire, PR Newswire, Market Wire, and GlobeNewsWire), SEC filings,
and the Capital IQ transactions database (e.g. M&A announcements, debt issuances, and share
buybacks). Some of the other data providers (e.g. Factiva) forbid automated downloads, thus
restricting their use in academic research. While researchers have frequently used the Capital IQ
database for transactions, we are one of the first to use its Key Developments database of news
items.7
We relate N ewsEvents, the number of news events, to either V estingM onth or Log(1+V estingSensitivity).
We control for several other determinants of news releases, described in more detail in Appendix A.
AGM and Board are dummy variables for whether there is an AGM or board meeting that month,
which Dimitrov and Jain (2011) show are positively associated with news releases. EAY early and
EAQuarterly are dummy variables for whether that month featured a yearly or quarterly earnings
announcement. EarningsSurprise is that quarter’s earnings surprise, taken from the Institutional
Broker Estimates Services (“I/B/E/S”) database. Analyst is the log of one plus the number of
analysts following the stock (from I/B/E/S). Balakrishnan, Billings, Kelly, and Ljungqvist (2014)
show that firms release more news to compensate for a loss in analyst coverage. After filtering for
the availability of these controls, we have 166,041 news releases.
We also control for V estedSensitivity and U nvestedSensitivity, the sensitivity of the CEO’s
already-vested and unvested equity, which are calculated analogously to V estingSensitivity. We
also use the logs of one plus those variables due to strong skewness. Due to the aforementioned
potential constraints on the sale of vested equity, we do not have clear predictions for the sign of
its coefficient. Since the strategic reallocation of news releases may not have a significant long-term
effect on firm value, the association with unvested equity is also unclear.
To gauge whether the news releases are positive or negative, we use data on the tone of subsequent media coverage from the Thomson Reuters News Analytics (“News Analytics”) database.
7

We are aware of only two working papers that use the Key Developments database: Nichols (2009) and Cohn,
Gurun, and Moussawi (2014)

12

This database contains firm-specific news articles from 41 media outlets that Thomson Reuters
transmits to its clients. It uses linguistic parsing to measure the proportion of words in a media
article that are positive, neutral, or negative.8
A separate analysis links equity vesting to equity sales, to show that vesting equity indeed
induces short-term stock price concerns. (For brevity, we will use the term “equity sales” to refer
to both standard sales of stock, and sales of shares acquired after option exercises.) We obtain
data from the Thomson Financial Insider Trading database, which is collected from SEC Form
4. SalesM onth is an indicator that equals one if the CEO sells any equity in a given month,
and SalesAll is an indicator that equals one if, by that month, the CEO has sold all the equity
that vested in the most recent vesting month. We control for Log(1+V estedSensitivity) and
Log(1+U nvestedSensitivity), because a CEO with significant unvested equity may have greater
diversification needs and thus sell equity more readily upon vesting. We also control for AGM ,
Board, EAY early, EAQuarterly, and EarningsSurprise, because these events may lead to news
releases that temporarily boost the stock price and encourage equity sales.
Our remaining tests investigate the stock price and trading volume reaction to news releases,
which we study using a standard event-study methodology, and we also study the interval between
news releases and equity sales.
Table 1 presents the summary statistics for our main variables. Panel A shows that vesting
periods average 3.4 years for stock and 3.6 years for options, with a maximum of 7 and 6.3 years,
respectively. Thus, vesting equity is determined by equity grants awarded to the CEO several
years prior, and can plausibly be considered exogenous to the current information environment. In
months with corporate news events in Capital IQ, a typical firm has an average of 4 news releases,
of which 3 are discretionary. Including the months with no news, the averages are 1.8 and 1.5. The
average (median) media article comprises 36% (23%) positive words, 38% (32%) negative words,
and 26% (16%) neutral words.
8

The News Analytics database covers 1996-2011; we only use the data starting from 2003, due to potential
survivorship bias prior to 2003 (see Scherbina and Schlusche (2013)).

13

In Panel B, we provide summary statistics on equity vesting and equity sales by CEOs. CEOs
sell on average $5.4 million of equity per year, there are 3 vesting months on average per year, and
CEOs trade in 4 out of 12 months on average.
Appendix D reports the correlations between some of the main variables used in this study.
Appendix E shows the distribution of events across the months in a calendar year. The first quarter
contains nearly 40% of vesting months and more than 70% of yearly earnings announcements. It
will therefore be important to control for month fixed effects in our analyses.

Equity Vesting Months and CEO Sales

This section studies whether CEOs indeed sell equity soon after it vests. In Table 2, we compute
the average distance between the month in which a CEO’s equity vests and the month in which we
first observe a subsequent equity sale.9
Panel A shows that in more than 50% of cases, the CEO sells stock in the vesting month. The
frequency of first equity sales in any subsequent month is less than 10%. The pattern is similar for
the exercise of options, but with lower magnitudes for the vesting month. In Panel B, we report
the time it takes for a CEO to sell all the equity that vests in a vesting month. In 17% of cases, the
CEO sells all the equity within the vesting month. The differences between the vesting month and
future months, although significant, are smaller in Panel B because it measures the likelihood of
selling equity by a particular month. Thus, mechanically, the further out the month, the more time
the CEO has to sell all of his vesting equity. However, the frequency of all sales in any subsequent
month remains below 10%.
The CEO pays a lower, long-term, capital gains tax rate if he waits 12 months after stock
vesting or option exercise before selling his shares (e.g. Cicero (2009) and Fos and Jiang (2014)).
However, in Table 2, equity sales in month 12 are only 2% higher than in month 11, and much
9
The following example illustrates how we treat the case of multiple vesting months before a sale. Assume that
equity vests in March and June, and that the first observed sale is in July. We consider this observation as both a
first sale 4 months after the March vesting month, and a first sale 1 month after the June vesting month.

14

smaller than the frequency of sales in the vesting month. Since most vesting-related trades happen
in the vesting month, we use this month for identification.
In Table 3, we conduct a multivariate regression on the determinants of CEO sales:

Saless,t = α + β ∗ V estingM onths,t + ρ ∗ M onthBef ores,t +

(1)

+ ν ∗ M onthAf ters,t + γ ∗ Controls + Fixed Effects + s,t ,

where s indexes a firm and t indexes a month. We use year, month, and firm fixed effects to control
for unobservable firm-level or time-specific determinants of equity sales. The dependent variable
Sales is SalesM onth in Panel A and SalesAll in Panel B. Our key independent variable of interest
is V estingM onth. We also include indicators for one month before (M onthBef ore) and one month
after (M onthAf ter) the vesting month. The remaining controls are as described in Section 2.
The results in Table 3 are consistent with those in Table 2. In column (1), we report that CEOs
are 23% more likely to sell shares in a month in which stock vests than in a month in which no
stock vests; this figure is 14% for options (column (2)). Moreover, CEOs are 15% more likely to
sell the full amount of vesting stock in the vesting month than by any subsequent month (column
(3)); this figure is 8% for options (column (4)). The control variables load with the expected sign.
CEOs are more likely to sell equity in months where earnings are announced or there is an AGM,
the greater the earnings surprise, and the greater his unvested equity.
Overall, the results in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that managers sell equity shortly after vesting,
and so vesting equity induces the CEO to be concerned with short-term stock prices. Since the
results are similar between stock and options, we will consider aggregate vesting of all equity in the
bulk of the paper.

News Releases in Equity Vesting Months

This section studies the relation between equity vesting months and the quantity and positivity of
news releases.

15

4.1

Quantity of News Releases

Table 4 reports the core result of this paper, that vesting equity is significantly related to news
releases. We run the following model for the number of news events, under the assumption of a
Poisson error structure:

N ewsEventss,t = α + β ∗ V estingM easures,t + ρ ∗ M onthBef ores,t +

(2)

+ ν ∗ M onthAf ters,t + γ ∗ Controls + Fixed Effects + s,t

This model accounts for the discreteness and skewness of our data by using an explicit stochastic specification for the news variable. In particular, we assume that our dependent variable
(N ewsEvents) follows a Poisson distribution.
In Panel A, our independent variable of interest (V estingM easure) is the V estingM onth
dummy. We add indicators for the one month before and after (MonthBefore and MonthAfter,
respectively). All specifications include year, month, and firm fixed effects.10 Column (1) includes the non-compensation controls: indicators for other newsworthy months AGM , Board,
EAY early, and EAQuarterly), as well as EarningsSurprise and Analyst. It shows that firms
release 2% more discretionary news in vesting months.11 Column (3) adds the compensation controls of Log(1+V estedSensitivity) and Log(1+U nvestedSensitivity) and the figure rises to 5%.12
In contrast, columns (2) and (4) show that the amount of non-discretionary news is no different
between vesting and non-vesting months, consistent with the CEO having less latitude to control
non-discretionary news.
There is also a significant reduction in discretionary news both one month before and one
month after the vesting month, suggesting that the CEO may be strategically delaying news until
the vesting month and accelerating it into the vesting month. Firms release 5% more discretionary
10

The results are unchanged when using CEO instead of firm fixed effects. They are also unchanged when using
fiscal year instead of calendar year effects.
11

To obtain this figure, we divide the coefficient of 0.0355 by the average number of discretionary news releases
of 1.48 per month, which is reported in Table 1, Panel A.
12
We present specification (1) without the compensation controls since the sensitivity of vested equity mechanically
falls in vesting months, potentially leading to multicollinearity. However, Appendix D shows that the correlation
between V estingM onth and Log(1+V estedSensitivity) is small in practice.

16

news in the vesting month compared to the prior month, both with the non-compensation controls
(column (1) and all controls (column (3)).
Panel B uses Log(1+V estingSensitivity) as the main independent variable. The sensitivity
of vesting equity is significantly positively related to discretionary news releases, but unrelated to
non-discretionary news releases.
The above analysis quantifies the increase in news releases in vesting months versus non-vesting
months. A broader question is the extent to which news releases are higher in months in which
the CEO sells equity in general. Equity sales can stem from channels other than vesting equity
– for example, a CEO may voluntarily hold already-vested equity as a long-term investment, but
later decides to rebalance his portfolio. Since actual equity sales are endogenous, we use vesting
months as an instrument. The two properties of vesting months discussed earlier – their high
correlation with sale months and their determination by equity grants awarded several years prior
– are analogous to the relevance criterion and the exclusion restriction for a valid instrument.
In Table 5, we report the results of an instrumental variables Poisson regression estimated via
Generalized Method of Moments, in which we instrument the endogenous regressor SalesM onth
using V estingM onth. The control variables are as in Table 4, except that we remove M onthBef ore
and M onthAf ter, as well as firm fixed effects. We test how the probability of selling in a given
\onth affects N ewsEvents. We find significant coefficients on SalesM
\onth for dismonth SalesM
cretionary news but not non-discretionary news. Thus, in months in which CEOs are predicted to
sell equity, they release more discretionary but not non-discretionary news.

4.2

Positivity of News Releases

While Section 4.1 studies the quantity of news items released, this section studies their positivity.
Our hypothesis is that, in vesting months, the CEO should release not only a greater number of
news items, but also more positive news. We measure the positivity of news releases using the tone
of media coverage immediately after the disclosure, since more positive news should lead the media
to write more favorable articles about the company.

17

In Table 6, we conduct an “event-study”-type analysis of the effect of news releases on the tone
of subsequent media coverage. Our dependent variable is the abnormal tone of a media article,
measured by the percentage of positive, neutral, or negative words as reported in News Analytics in
the 2-day ([0,1]), 16-day ([0,15]), and 31-day ([0,30]) period afterwards, minus the average positive,
neutral, or negative tone score for media articles over [-300,-46]. The univariate analysis in Panel A
shows that discretionary disclosures in vesting months lead to media coverage with more positive
(columns (1)-(3)) words and fewer neutral (columns (4)-(6)) words across all windows, consistent
with the news releases themselves being positive. Columns (7)-(9) show no systematic change in
the proportion of negative words, but columns (10)-(12) show that the “net positivity” of media
coverage (proportion of positive words minus proportion of negative words) is significantly greater
in all windows. There is no systematic pattern for non-discretionary news releases in the vesting
month. For example, the net positivity measure is significantly negative for [0,1] but significantly
positive for [0,30]. Similarly, there is no systematic pattern for non-vesting months. For both
discretionary and non-discretionary news, the net positivity measure is significantly negative for
[0,1] but significantly positive for [0,15].
Panel B controls for other newsworthy events on the day of the news release: days of earnings
announcements (EADay), AGM meetings (AGM Day), and board meetings (BoardDay). The
results are similar to Panel A. We also test for the difference in media tone between vesting and
non-vesting months after controlling for these events. Discretionary news releases lead to the
proportion of positive words in a [0,1] window being 1.3 percentage points higher in vesting than
non-vesting months, significant at the 1% level. The difference is also significant at the 1% level
for the [0,15] and [0,30] windows, and for the net positivity measure over all three windows. In
contrast, the difference for non-discretionary news releases is insignificant across all three windows,
for both the positivity and net positivity measures. These results suggest that managers release
significantly more positive discretionary news in vesting months than non-vesting months, but the
positivity of non-discretionary news is no different.
Figure 1 graphically illustrates the results of Table 6. It depicts the difference in tone of media
coverage over a [0,30] day window after discretionary news releases in vesting months versus non-

18

vesting months. The frequency of positive words is significantly larger after discretionary news
released in vesting months compared to non-vesting months. It is negatively correlated with the
frequency of neutral words, suggesting that the media is substituting away from neutral into positive
words, consistent with Table 6.

5

Returns and Volume in Equity Vesting Months

We have shown that CEOs release more news in vesting months, and that such news is more likely
to be positive. Our hypothesis is that they do so to increase the stock price and trading volume, by
reducing information asymmetry and attracting investor attention. In Table 7, we study whether
news releases indeed have these effects. In Panel A, we calculate the average 2-day ([0,1]), 16-day
([0,15]), and 31-day ([0,30]) cumulative abnormal return (CAR) and daily abnormal trading volume
around the release of discretionary news. We use these different windows to test whether any price
and volume increases are temporary, as predicted by an attention story. The CAR is calculated
over the CRSP value-weighted index, using a beta estimated over [-300,-46]. The daily abnormal
trading volume is the daily trading volume minus the average trading volume over [-70,-31], divided
by the number of shares outstanding, and excludes the CEO’s own trades.
The univariate analysis of Panel A shows that a discretionary news release in a vesting month
is associated with a 16-day CAR of 28 bps (t = 4.54); the 2-day CAR is similar. The positive stock
price reaction to discretionary news releases in vesting months is consistent with these releases being
more positive, as documented in Table 6. However, it could also arise from the news attracting
attention to the stock – thus, Section 4 uses the tone of media articles, rather than the stock price
reaction, as our measure of the positivity of news releases. As a back-of-the-envelope calculation
of the dollar gain to the CEO, Table 1, Panel B reports that the average annual value of CEO
equity vesting is $5.18 million.13 Therefore, a 28 bp CAR implies an average gain of $14,504.
While this gain appears modest, it is in line with gains reported in cases of illegal insider trading.
13
This figure represents the CEO’s gain if he discloses one additional news item in each vesting month, and sells
the vesting equity 16 days after the disclosure. Instead of using the CEO’s average annual vesting equity, we could
use his average annual equity sales of $5.44 million. This would imply slightly higher gains for the CEO.

19

For example, Meulbroek (1992) reports a median gain per security of $17,628.14 This figure is for
1980-9 (i.e. with a midpoint of 1985) whereas our numbers are for 2002-11 (i.e. with a midpoint of
2007). Adjusting for inflation, the Meulbroek (1992) number becomes $33,968 in 2007 terms. Since
insider trading is illegal and thus highly risky, it is logical that the benefit should be higher than
for strategic news timing. Moreover, the gain to strategic news timing is even higher if the CEO
discloses several news items. In addition to entailing no legal cost, it arguably involves less effort
than other attempts to inflate the stock price (such as changing investment projects). The estimated
gains to the CEO are economically meaningful but also plausible. In particular, while significant
for the CEO (especially because they come at little cost), they are not substantial compared to
firm value, and so it is unlikely that boards would intervene to prevent such strategic timing. The
main effect is on stakeholders who base their decisions on the stock price, or on the distribution of
wealth between trading shareholders.
Panel A also reports the price reactions to disclosures in non-vesting months. The 2-day CAR
for discretionary news in non-vesting months is smaller than for vesting months, at 17 bps compared
to 25 bps, while the 16- and 31-day CARs are higher. These results suggest that the CEO may
be releasing particularly attention-grabbing news in vesting months, which has a short-lived price
impact. Panel B shows that, after controlling for EADay, AGM Day, and BoardDay, the 2-day
(25 bps) and 16-day (28 bps) CARs to discretionary news releases are significant at the 1% level,
and the 31-day (15 bps) CAR is significant at the 10% level. The 2-day reaction to discretionary
news is 8 bps higher for vesting months than non-vesting months, significant at the 5% level. In
contrast, the difference in reactions for non-discretionary news is insignificant, consistent with the
CEO having less latitude to affect non-discretionary news.
In addition to increasing the stock price, news releases can also benefit the CEO by increasing
the trading volume, thus reducing the price impact of his equity sales. The right-hand side of Table
7, Panel A, reports that, in a vesting month, the release of discretionary news generates significant
average daily abnormal trading volume of 0.32% (t = 31.53) of shares outstanding over 2 days,
14

This figure includes not only CEOs but all defendants formally charged with insider trading. As an example
of a high-profile case, Martha Stewart avoided losses of $45,673 when she sold shares of ImClone Systems in 2001,
leading to a insider trading trial and indictment.

20

and 0.03% (t = 7.47) over 16 days.15 The average abnormal trading volume is insignificant over
31 days, consistent with news releases creating a short-lived attention boost, consistent with the
CAR being lower over [0,30] than [0,15]. The above figures compare to an average daily trading
volume of 0.22%, and the CEO’s average equity sale (on a sale day) of 0.165% of shares outstanding.
Thus, the 2-day abnormal trading volume is nearly double the average CEO equity sale, and so
can provide adequate camouflage. Note that this high ratio is not because CEO sale volumes are
small: the average CEO equity sale is 6.2% of the average daily trading volume.
Panel B adds controls for other events and finds a similar pattern. The abnormal trading volume
associated with discretionary news is significantly higher for vesting than non-vesting months using
a 2- or 16-day window (0.05% and 0.01% with p-values of 0.00 and 0.03, respectively), suggesting
that news in vesting months attract more attention. The difference is insignificant for the 31day window (0.01% with a p-value of 0.29). For non-discretionary news, the difference in abnormal
trading volume between vesting and non-vesting months is insignificant across all windows (p-values
ranging from 0.55 to 0.86). The abnormal trading volume for non-discretionary news is higher than
for discretionary news, likely because the former category includes earnings announcements.
Since the stock price and volume increases are temporary, we study whether CEOs indeed take
advantage of these short-term effects by selling their equity shortly after news releases in vesting
months. Figure 2 illustrates the number of trading days between a discretionary news release and
the first subsequent CEO equity sale. We focus on discretionary news releases that are within 30
days of the most recent vesting date, as these releases are most likely to be prompted by vesting
(and thus the intention to sell) rather than other reasons. Half of the first equity sales occur within
5 days after the release of discretionary news in vesting months, compared to more than 45 days
for non-discretionary news.16 In Figure 3, we show that it takes the median CEO only 7 days to
sell all of his newly-vested equity after the release of a discretionary news item that is within 30
days of the most recent vesting date.
15

The figures in Table 7 exclude the CEO trades from the calculation of abnormal trading volume. Including
them has very little effect on the results.
16

We also consider only the release of non-discretionary news that is within 30 days of the most recent vesting

date.

21

Overall, our results indicate that the timing of corporate news may be influenced by CEOs
seeking to attract investor attention, reduce information asymmetry, or release more positive news.
The greater price reaction to discretionary news releases in vesting versus non-vesting months
suggests that the market does not take into account the CEO’s greater incentives to release news in
vesting months. Thus, news releases do affect stock prices, and so potentially have redistributional
consequences and affect real decisions. One potential explanation for why the market does not take
into account the CEO’s short-term concerns is that data on equity vesting is not salient and must be
hand-collected from footnotes and Form 4 filings. Lilienfeld-Toal and Ruenzi (2014) find long-run
abnormal returns to portfolios formed on standard measures of CEO incentives (wealth-performance
sensitivity). That even standard elements of the CEO’s contract are not fully incorporated by the
market is consistent with the market not taking into account the CEO’s equity vesting schedule, the
calculation of which requires hand collection from footnotes. Similarly, Edmans, Fang, and Lewellen
(2014) find that CEOs with significant vesting equity enjoy superior earnings announcement returns.
In addition, while a rational market may discount the information content of positive news releases
issued by a manager with vesting equity, the positive returns to disclosures may stem from them
attracting attention (rather than their information content), which is less likely to be discounted.
Indeed, we also find a greater volume reaction to discretionary news released in vesting versus
non-vesting months, consistent with an attention story.

Robustness Tests

This section examines the robustness of our main findings in Table 4 to alternative samples and
measurement choices. In Table 8, we report estimates obtained from using the same specification
as column (3) of Table 4 (the effect of vesting equity on the number of discretionary news releases,
including all controls), unless otherwise noted. To save space, we report only the coefficients
on the independent variables of interest. Panel A studies V estingM onth, M onthBef ore, and
M onthAf ter, and Panel B investigates Log(1+V estingSensitivity).

22

In column (1) of Panel A, we restrict our sample to firms that were part of the S&P 500 at
some point during the period between 1994 and 2011. This restriction excludes small firms in the
Russell 3000 covered by Equilar. The positive and significant coefficient on V estingM onth, and the
negative and significant coefficients on M onthBef ore and M onthAf ter, suggest that our results
in Table 4 are not driven by small firms that could be illiquid or release little news.
In column (2), we restrict our sample to firms covered in the Equilar database, which covers
Russell 3000 firms from 2006 to 2011 and has been used by prior literature, such as Gopalan,
Milbourn, Song, and Thakor (2014) and Edmans, Fang, and Lewellen (2014). This excludes our
hand-collected data of S&P 500 firms for the period between 1994 and 2005. Our results remain
significant, which suggests that they are not due to any particular feature or systematic bias of our
hand-collected data.
Aboody and Kasznik (2000) and Daines, McQueen, and Schonlau (2014) argue that CEOs
release more negative news before the award date of an option grant, and more positive news after
the award date. In column (3), we control for GrantM onth, a dummy variable for the award date
of (actual) option grants. The coefficient on V estingM onth remains positive and significant and
the coefficients on both adjacent months remain negative and significant.17
In column (4), we run a placebo test in the spirit of Daines, McQueen, and Schonlau (2014).
In particular, we create a pseudo-vesting month that is exactly 6 months after the actual vesting
month. The coefficient is insignificant, suggesting that the result is not driven by other spurious
events with a cyclical pattern.
Bettis, Bizjak, Coles, and Kalpathy (2010) find that performance-based vesting provisions have
become increasingly common in equity grants. Such grants will not vest on their scheduled vesting
date if certain performance thresholds have not been met, and so may provide weaker incentives
to release news. Column (5) excludes from our sample all equity grants with performance-based
vesting provisions; this information is available in Equilar and the footnotes of Form 4 filings and
proxy statements. Our results are unchanged.
17

Appendix D shows the distribution of vesting and award months across the calendar year.

23

The award of restricted stock to CEOs has become more common than options recently (Frydman and Jenter (2010)), in part due to the option backdating scandal. In columns (6) and (7) we
limit our sample to stock and options, respectively. For both stock and options, V estingM onth
remains positive and significant; thus, our results are not driven by a component of compensation (options) that is becoming less common nowadays. The coefficients on M onthBef ore and
M onthAf ter remain negative in both columns, although they are now insignificant, likely because
each specification only uses partial information on the CEO’s equity.
In column (8) we define a vesting month as a month in which either stock and/or in-the-money
options vest. The rationale is that out-of-the-money options are unlikely to be exercised upon
vesting, and thus provide the CEO with incentives to increase the stock price. The coefficient on
V estingM onth remains positive and significant, and the coefficient on M onthBef ore is negative
and significant.
In Panel B of Table 8, our main independent variable is (Log(1+VestingSensitivity)). The model
specifications presented in Panel B are similar to those in Panel A, except that in column (3) we
control for Log(1+GrantSensitivity) (the log of one plus the sensitivity of new equity grants)
instead of GrantM onth. In column (4), we replace option deltas with intrinsic values and calculate
VestingSensitivityAdjusted, which assigns a value of 0 for out-of-the-money options and a value of
1 for in-the-money options. Again, the rationale is that only in-the-money options are likely to be
exercised immediately upon vesting. The results remain significant.

Conclusion

This paper shows that managers strategically time the disclosure of discretionary corporate news to
coincide with the scheduled vesting of their equity grants. Discretionary disclosures are significantly
higher in months in which equity is scheduled to vest, and significantly lower in the months before
and after vesting. They are associated with favorable media coverage, suggesting that they are
positive in tone. The news releases lead to temporary increases in the stock price and trading

24

volume, consistent with an attention story. CEOs exploit these temporary effects: the median
CEO sells all his vesting equity within 7 days of a discretionary news release in a vesting month.
Our results have two main implications. First, we show that a CEO’s contract affects firm
behavior; moreover it affects not just corporate decisions (as typically studied by the myopia literature) but also the firm’s information environment. This result links corporate finance to financial
markets. Second, we provide evidence that CEOs strategically time the release of news, using a
measure of CEO incentives that is likely exogenous to the current information environment. Information does not just flow mechanically to financial markets when events occur, but instead the
timing of news releases can be strategically chosen by the CEO. These news releases in turn affect stock prices, and thus may have distributional consequences on shareholders who trade, and
efficiency consequences on stakeholders who base their decisions on corporate news or stock prices.

Table 2: Time from Vesting to First Sale and to Full Sale
This table reports the distance between the month of equity vesting and the month of the first observed sale
of the CEO (Panel A), as well as the time it takes the CEO to sell all the equity that vested in the most recent
vesting month (Panel B). The data on equity vesting is extracted from Equilar (for Russell 3000 firms for 20062011) and hand-collected from SEC Form 4 and proxy statements (for S&P500 firms for 1994-2005). The data
on CEO trading is extracted from Thomson Financial Insider Trading filings (SEC Form 4). In Panel A we
present the results for stock and options separately. In Panel B, we aggregate equity sales that are the result
of either stock or option vesting. We show the frequency of observations and their respective percentages.

Table 3: Equity Vesting and CEO Sales
This table reports the results on the relationship between CEO equity sales and equity vesting months.
The dependent variable is SalesM onth in columns (1) and (2), and SalesAll in columns (3) and (4).
The variable V estingM onth is an indicator function that equals one if an equity grant vests in a given
month.
The variables M onthBef ore and M onthAf ter indicate the months before and after the vesting
month. Controls are described in Appendix A. t-statistics are in parentheses, standard errors are clustered
at the firm level, and ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ represent significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 4: Timing of News Events Around the Vesting Month
This table reports the Poisson regression on the relationship between the count of corporate news releases and
vesting months. The dependent variable N ewsEvents is the count of corporate news releases. In Panel A,
our main independent variable (V estingM easure) is an indicator function that equals one if a particular month
is a vesting month (VestingMonth), and zero otherwise. We also include the months surrounding the vesting
month, using the functions M onthBef ore and M onthAf ter indicating the months before and after vesting, respectively. In Panel B, our main independent variable (V estingM easure) is the sensitivity of newly-vesting equity to changes in the stock price (Log(1+VestingSensitivity)). Controls are described in Appendix A. t-statistics
are in parentheses, and ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ represent significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 5: News Releases and Equity Sales
This table reports the results of an instrumental variables Poisson regression estimated via GMM. We relate corporate
news releases with months in which the CEO sells equity. We instrument the endogenous regressor SalesMonth using
\onth. Controls are described in Appendix A. We also
VestingMonth which results in the instrumented variable SalesM
control for year and month fixed effects. We allow for heteroskedasticity of the errors, and we cluster the errors by firm.
t-statistics are in parentheses and ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ represent significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

This table reports the results of an event-study on the effect of corporate news releases on the tone of subsequent media coverage.
We denote by DV and
DNV the discretionary news released in vesting and non-vesting months, respectively.
Similarly, we denote by NDV and NDNV the non-discretionary news
that released in vesting and non-vesting months, respectively.
The dependent variable is the proportion of positive (columns (1)-(3)), neutral (columns (4)(6)), negative (columns (7)-(9)), or positive minus negative (columns (10)-(12)) words in a [0,1], [0,15], and [0,30] window in excess of their respective averages over [-300,-46]. These proportions are calculated from the Thomson Reuters News Analytics database. Below Panel B, we test for the difference in the
tone of media coverage between vesting and non-vesting months, after the release of discretionary (DV-DNV) and non-discretionary (NDV-NDNV) news. Controls are described in Appendix A. t-statistics are in parentheses, and ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ represent significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 6: Tone of Media Coverage

Table 7: Reactions to News Events in the Vesting Month
This table reports the results of an event-study on the effect of corporate news releases on subsequent stock returns and
trading volume. We denote by DV and DNV the discretionary news released in vesting and non-vesting months, respectively. Similarly, we denote by NDV and NDNV the non-discretionary news that released in vesting and non-vesting
months, respectively. We use a [0,1], [0,15], and [0,30] window. The cumulative abnormal return is the raw buy-andhold return adjusted using a beta estimated over [-300,-46] with a market model. The average daily abnormal trading volume is in excess of its average value in the period [-70,-31], and excludes the CEO’s own trades. Panel A reports a univariate analysis, and Panel B reports a multivariate analysis that controls for other newsworthy events, described in Appendix A. Below Panel B, we test for the difference in the the stock price and volume reactions between
vesting and non-vesting months, after the release of discretionary (DV-DNV) and non-discretionary (NDV-NDNV) news.
t-statistics are in parentheses, and ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ represent significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

This table reports the results of robustness tests to alternative samples and measurement choices. We use the same specification as column (5) of Table 4, unless otherwise noted. In Panel A, our main independent variable is an indicator function that equals one if a particular month is a vesting month (VestingMonth), and zero otherwise. Column (1) restricts our sample to firms that were part of the S&P 500 at some point over 1994-2011. Column (2) restricts our sample to firms covered in the
Equilar database, which covers Russell 3000 firms over 2006-2011. Column (3) controls for grant award months. Column (4) runs a placebo test that uses a pseudo-vesting
month that is 6 months after the actual vesting month. Column (5) excludes all equity-based grants with a performance-based vesting provision. Column (6) considers restricted stock only, and column (7) considers options only. Column (8) redefines a vesting month as a month in which either stock and/or in-the-money options vest, excluding the cases in which only out-the-money options vest. In Panel B, our main independent variable is the sensitivity of newly-vesting equity to changes in the stock price
(Log(1+VestingSensitivity)). The specifications presented in Panel B are similar to those in Panel A, except that we use Log(1+GrantSensitivity) instead of GrantM onth
in column (3), and in column (4) we replace option deltas with their intrinsic values of 0 for out-the-money options and 1 for in-the-money options, with which we create the variable Log(1+VestingSensitivityAdjusted). t-statistics are in parentheses, and ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ represent significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Number of Days After the Discretionary News Release Date

Figure 1: Tone of Media Coverage After Discretionary News Releases
This figure shows the difference between vesting and non-vesting months regarding the tone of media coverage after
the release of discretionary news. We show the differences in average positive, neutral, and negative sentiment scores
of the media articles, as reported in the Thomson Reuters News Analytics database over [0,30] in excess of the average
score over [-300,-46].

Number of Days from News Releases to CEO Equity Sales

Figure 2: Number of Days from News Releases to CEO Sales
This figure reports the distribution of the number of trading days between the date of the release of corporate news
and the first observed equity sale of the CEO. We consider news releases in vesting months, and show the results
separately for discretionary and non-discretionary news items. We truncate the y-axis at 0.16 for better visualization
of the graph. The frequency bar for non-discretionary news for more than 45 days between the release of news and
the first CEO sale (> 45), has a value of 0.61. News items are obtained from the Capital IQ database, which covers
2002-2011. We consider only discretionary news that is released within 30 days of the most recent vesting date.

Number of Days from News Rleases to CEO Full Sale

Figure 3: Number of Days from Discretionary News Releases to CEO Full Sale
This figure shows the distribution of the number of trading days between the date of the release of discretionary news
and the date the CEO sells all the equity that vested in the most recent vesting month. For the purpose of this graph,
we only consider discretionary news released in the 30 days after the vesting date. We truncate the y-axis at 0.12 for
better visualization of the graph. The frequency bar for non-discretionary news for more than 45 days between the
release of news and the CEO’s full sale (> 45), has a value of 0.16.
