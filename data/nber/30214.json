    "abstract": "\n\nPoliticizing policies designed to address market failures can diminish their effectiveness. We document a pattern of \u201cpolitical adverse selection\u201d in the health insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA; \u201cObamacare\u201d in political debates): Republicans enrolled at lower rates than Democrats and independents, a gap driven by healthier Republicans. This selection raised public subsidy spending by approximately $124 per enrollee annually (2.4% of average cost). We field a survey to show this selection does not exist for other insurance products. Lower enrollment and higher costs are concentrated in more Republican areas, potentially contributing to polarized views of the policy.\n\n",
