    "abstract": "\n\nThe equity premium consists of a term premium reflecting the longer maturity of equity relative to short-term bills, and a risk premium reflecting the stochastic nature of equity payoffs and the deterministic nature of payoffs on reckless bills.  This paper analyzes term premia and the risk premia in a general equilibrium model with catching up with the Joneses preferences and a novel formulation of leverage.  Closed-form solutions for moments of asset returns are derived.  First-order approximations illustrate the effects of parameters and provide an algorithm to match the means and variances of the riskless rate and the rate of return on equity.\n\n",
