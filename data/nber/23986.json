    "abstract": "\n\nIncentive problems make securities\u2019 payo\ufb00s imperfectly pledgeable, limiting agents\u2019 ability to issue liabilities. We analyze the equilibrium consequences of such endogenous incompleteness in a dynamic exchange economy. Because markets are endogenously incomplete, agents have di\ufb00erent intertemporal marginal rates of substitution, so that they value assets di\ufb00erently. Consequently, agents hold di\ufb00erent portfolios. This leads to endogenous markets segmentation, which we characterize with Optimal Trans-port methods. Moreover, there is a basis going always in the same direction: the price of a security is lower than that of replicating portfolios of long positions. Finally, equilibrium expected returns are concave in factor loadings.\n\n",
