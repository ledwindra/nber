    "abstract": "\n\nA menu description presents a mechanism to player i in two steps. Step (1) uses the reports of other players to describe i\u2019s menu: the set of i\u2019s potential outcomes. Step (2) uses i\u2019s report to select i\u2019s favorite outcome from her menu. Can menu descriptions better expose strategyproofness, without sacrificing simplicity? We propose a new, simple menu description of Deferred Acceptance. We prove that\u2014in contrast with other common matching mechanisms\u2014this menu description must differ substantially from the corresponding traditional description. We demonstrate, with a lab experiment on two elementary mechanisms, the promise and challenges of menu descriptions.\n\n",
