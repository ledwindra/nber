An Evaluation of the Impact of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (SPFTZ)

JEL No. F38
ABSTRACT
In this paper we present evidence as to the effects of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone
(SPFTZ) on China’s capital controls. The start of the SPFTZ in September, 2013 was a trial to introduce
a combination of exchange rate floating and capital account liberalization into China’s macro policy
mix. We employ three methods to test the SPFTZ’s impact on capital controls: price spread tests between
CNH and CNY, RMB yield gaps between onshore and offshore RMB markets, and Granger causalities
among China’s money supply and the foreign interest rates. All these tests give consistent results suggesting
that the impact of China’s capital controls is weaker since the SPFTZ.

1. Introduction and Background

The adoption of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (hereafter SPFTZ) at the
end of September, 2013 is part of an ambitious trial for a new round of Chinese reform
and opening out, with stress on capital liberalization1. After one year’s operation, we
offer an evaluation of the impact of the SPFTZ on China’s capital controls.

China is the largest economy in the world which still maintains relatively rigorous
capital controls. According to the capital liberalization criteria of the IMF, China has
controls on all thirteen sub-items of capital transactions2. Although capital controls are
normal in developing countries which lack foreign exchange, it may seem strange for
China who have a large share of total foreign reserves in the world. Capital controls
have also been an obstacle to the internationalization of the RMB, but they also serve
as a seawall for the domestic financial market.

China maintains capital controls for both state security and policy independence. The
Asian financial crisis in 1990s taught China that capital liberalization can be dangerous
without enough preparation. According to the “Impossible Trinity3”, there cannot be
simultaneously a fixed exchange rate, capital liberalization and independent monetary

policy. To the Chinese government which insists on independence in foreign policies,
surrendering monetary policy to others is unimaginable. Therefore China must choose
between a fixed exchange rate and capital liberalization. In the past China chose the
former: a pegged (and often under-valued) RMB; with rigorous capital controls,
especially on capital out flows and hot money in flows.

Such a policy combination induces export orientation and foreign capital competition,
and fits well with a “catching up strategy” for China. China’s GDP more than tripled in
merely twelve years after she joined the WTO in 2001, reflecting an annual rate of
growth of 10.09%. As a result, China’s foreign reserves increased sharply. The value of
China’s total reserves in 2001 was 220 billion current US$, and by 2013 they had
increased to 3.88 trillion, more than triple the second largest reserve holder Japan’s 1.27
trillion (Fig.1).

Source: WDI database
But the accumulation of foreign reserve while maintaining a stable RMB has its own
3

price. The balance sheet of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), China’s central bank,
must be balanced. As the assets increased quickly with the accumulation of reserves,
the PBoC had to increase its debt equally, which meant injecting more money into the
economy. The rate of increase of China’s M0 has been in about 10 percent in recent
years, with a M2 increase of nearly 15 percent (Fig.2). At the end of September, 2014,
the M2 of China was 120205 billion of yuan. By comparison, the M2 of the U.S. at the
same time was US dollar 11473 billion. This means that although China’s GDP is only
one-third of that of the U.S., China’s money supply is about two-thirds more, which
contributes to inflation and asset price booms in recent years.

Source: the IMF database
Because of the problems induced by the fixed exchange rate and capital controls, the
Chinese government now seeks to adjust to a combination of a relatively open capital
account and some degree of float in the RMB, while maintaining her policy
independence. Since July 2005, China has allowed RMB crawling appreciation to a
basket of currencies, and the floating band has been enlarged to ±2%. Capital controls
4

have been loosened gradually, with a RMB internationalization policy in place from
July 2009. This process continues with the SPFTZ.

Launched on Sep.29, 2013, the SPFTZ is more than a traditional “free trade area”, and
more a trial zone for China’s new opening and reform strategy. It is a unilateral set of
measures and procedures relating to a small area in Shanghai, which has promised
liberalization on capital account and trade facilitation as its main objectives. After one
year’s operation, the SPFTZ has already met several important policy objectives in
reforming legal and regulatory system; adopting a negative list management for foreign
investment; improving trade facilitations and introducing financial innovations. We
give a detailed introduction of the SPFTZ in Yao and Whalley (2014).

2. Growing Cross-Border Capital Flows Since the SPFTZ

a) China’s Capital Flows in Recent Years

We begin with the effects of the SPFTZ on capital flows. Although the definition of
capital flows is clear, there are some difficulties in computing the cross-border capital
flows for China. Ma (2008) defines capital flows as the sum of debit and credit flows
on China’s balance of payments, excluding errors and omissions. According to his
calculation, in 2005 gross capital account flows represented 40% of China’s GDP. Ma
(2008) acknowledged that such a definition is likely to underestimate capital flows
5

because some capital flows take the form of current account transactions in order to
avoid official restrictions, and most reported bank-related gross flows represent changes
between two dates and do not capture any intervening gross flows1.

We compute China’s capital flows for a more recent year following Ma (2008). These
data are calculated from the Balance of Payments database of the IMF2, and capital
flows are computed as the change between two years. As listed in Table 1, both the
capital flows in and out of China have increased rapidly since 2009.

In theory we can compute the net capital flow in a period by comparing the capital stock change between the
beginning and the end of that period. The actual capital flow may be larger than this if there is capital in flow and
out flow in such period. See Ma(2008), p.105, footnote 2.

Reserves) and Employee Stock Options, which is omitted here because the amount for China is very small.

Flows to Emerging Markets”, which depicts China’s capital flows directly, but data are
restricted to its members. Fig.3 replicates the IIF’s report in October, 20144.

Source: the IIF
Although different data sources can vary substantively, we can see that capital flows
have increased during the previous years. This suggests that the Chinese economy has
become more integrated into the global economy and hence more exposed to the
fluctuation of international markets. In particular, the rapid increase of out-flow capital
points to the use of more opportunities to evade capital controls, which questions the
effectiveness of capital controls.

b) China’s Hot Money Flows in Recent Years

Another way to evaluate the impact of capital controls is to calculate hot money flows,
defined as the difference between capital inflows and the increase of foreign reserves.
In theory all foreign exchange from international transactions must be forwarded
through banks to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) and be
exchanged as RMB. Therefore, if the capital inflow is larger than the increase of
reserves there should be a hot money outflow which cannot be tracked by official
records.

We have calculated the hot money inflows of China between 2006 and 2012, and report
them in Table 2. We can see that the hot money fluctuated dramatically during this
period. In the beginning and the end there is hot money outflow, while in the middle
years there is hot money inflow. In the year of 2012, the outflow of hot money
skyrocketed to 326.7 billion. The hot money volume itself may be more relevant to the
market expectation of Chinese economy and the appreciation of RMB, but such a huge
increase can also be regarded as indicating that the impact of capital controls is
weakening.

c) Capital flows since the SPFTZ

Since the start of the SPFTZ on 30th, September, 2013, capital flows of China have
increased. Table 3 is based on the Balance of Payments of China in recent quarters6.
Before the start of the SPFTZ, the inflow and outflow volumes were about 300-400
billion US dollars. From the fourth quarter of 2013, the capital outflow increased
gradually to US dollar 620 billion. The capital inflow shows a more rapid increase,
from US dollar 402 billion to 636 billion, more than a half increase in three quarters.

3. A Price Spread Test

We have shown that the capital flows in and out of China have increased in recent years,
and this increase has speeded up since the start of the SPFTZ. But the increase of capital
flows cannot itself be treated as a proxy for lowered capital control impact. If every
flow must acquire a permit from the government, volume increases can simply indicate

Balance of Payments. Some analysts think there hides “hot money” flows in this account.
10

a busy government. A more direct test of capital control impact of the SPFTZ is to
check whether there exist substantial cross-border arbitrage opportunities for a
considerable period of time after the introduction of the SPFTZ. According to the law
of one price, if capital flows were free, there should be no significant and persistent
price differences for the same financial assets across the border of China. As Ma (2008)
pointed out, when price and flow measures are consistent with each other, one may
arrive at an easy conclusion regarding capital mobility, but when they point in different
directions, price evidence should be given more weight. In the following we conduct
price tests for the impact of China’s capital controls since the SPFTZ.

a) The Offshore Exchange Market and the CNH

We already reported that the start of the SPFTZ has induced more capital flows in and
out of China. Therefore, assessment of its impact on capital controls can be achieved
by studying the price spread between CNY and CNH 1 . The CNY is the onshore
exchange rate of RMB, while the CNH is the offshore exchange rate of RMB in Hong
Kong, China. If capital controls have been loosened, this price spread should show a
tendency to diminish since the founding of SPFTZ.

b) Data description

We can obtain the CNH daily exchange rate data from both Wind Database and

1

There is currently a dual system of RMB markets, see Chen and Whalley (2013)
11

Bloomberg. The time period is from 08/31/2012 to 09/30/2014, with September 29th,
2013 on which the SPFTZ was founded at the middle of the interval. The source of
CNY daily exchange rate data is the FRED Economic Data by the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis, U.S. Although the People’s Bank of China also provide the daily
CNY data, we can use the data from FRED because it is more convenient when
comparing with other international data (for example the exchange rate of Euro).

The use of daily data brings a problem of the time gap and mismatch in transaction
dates. All the financial transaction are stopped during the weekends and holidays. While
the weekend’s data are the same all over the world, the holidays date in different
countries can vary significantly. In the FRED Data there is no transaction on the U.S.
federal holidays including New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, President’s
Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor’s Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day,
Thanksgiving and Christmas. The CNH transaction takes in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), where the holidays are even more complex with
three kinds: Chinese, western and local holidays. Therefore, the CNH transaction stops
on the Lunar New Year’s Day, Ching Ming Festival, Birthday of Buddha, Tuen Ng
Festival, HKSAR Establishment Day, Chinese Mid-Autumn Day, Chinese National
Day, Chung Yeung Festival and Christmas. In order to make data comparable, all such
mismatched data are deleted.

Altogether we have 493 matched transaction days and 493 pairs of CNY and CNH
12

exchange rate data. The price spread of CNY to CNH can be easily computed, and we
draw a chart for it as Fig.4.

Source: Authors’ computation based on the Wind, Fred and Bloomberg Databases

From Fig.4 we can see that generally speaking the start of the SPFTZ has brought the
price spread of CNY and CNH closer. In the year before the SPFTZ, the price spread
reached 300 basis points (1 base point equals 0.0001). But since the SPFTZ, especially
since later March, the price spread seldom reached 100 base points. Considering that
the financial liberal policy of supporting RMB cross-border use in the SPFTZ was
declared on February 21st, 2014, the price spread data fits this policy quite well.

There are several periods when the price spread is relatively high, most obviously from
early January to mid-March. It emphasizes that we cannot explain the movement of that
price spread only by the financial policy in SPFTZ. In order to give a reasonable
13

explanation of such disparities, we need consider other elements determining the
exchange rates of CNY and CNH.

c) The relationship between CNY and CNH

Since CNY and CNH are essentially the prices of the same currency, the yuan, the
fundamental elements such as exports, imports, price level and money supply are the
same. This is the reason why the two prices are very similar most of the times. In fact,
the correlation of them in the period of study is 0.9901.

As to the short term elements, the CNY is the price on the domestic foreign exchange
market, and there will be intervention by the Chinese authorities, usually the People’s
Bank of China. After the end of each transaction day, the People’s Bank of China will
decree a mid-price of CNY according to the closing prices of RMB to other currencies
on that day. The Center for Foreign Exchange Transactions of China is authorized to
publish this mid-price on the next transaction day, and all the brokers in the foreign
exchange market must offer a price within designated limits of this mid-price. The limit
was 0.3 percent from the reform of exchange rate mechanism in July 2005, enlarged to
0.5 percent in May 2007, enlarged again to 1 percent in April 2012, and currently is no
more than 2 percent, all in both directions. Although the limit is enlarged steadily,
considering that the main brokers in the market are the state-controlled banks, the CNY
is more a planning price than a market price.
14

Because the offshore CNH market is much smaller than the onshore CNY market, there
is no surprise that for most of the time the CNH shows the same movement as the CNY.
But since there are less financial controls in HKSAR, the CNH is more sensitive to the
changes in international capital markets. This can be seen by analyzing the movements
of US dollar.

Source: the Fred Database
Fig.5 depicts the trend of trade weighted USD index and CNY in the past two years.
We can see basically the two series are negative correlated. Their correlation is -0.5821.
But in the period from mid-January to early April, 2014, while the USD index kept
stable at around 77.0, the CNY depreciated quickly from 6.06 to 6.24, with a loss in
value of more than 3%. This period corresponds to the relatively large positive price
spread between CNY and CNH. Similarly, from the mid-September the USD index has
appreciated from 78.5 to 81.3, but the CNY kept at about 6.14. This corresponds to the
negative price spread between CNY and CNH.
15

As Chen and Whalley (2013) point out, the spread between CNH and CNY represents
the benefits of effective convertibility through market transactions. We can draw a
conclusion that, although CNH show the same movements along with CNY in most
time, there will be a relatively larger price difference between them if CNY moves in
the opposite direction to the USD. The underlying policy explanations for these two
periods are as follows. From mid-January to early April, 2014, Chinese authorities
manipulated the CNY to depreciate, which did not accord with the international
financial market, and the CNH value is higher than CNY. From later September,
Chinese authorities did not let the CNY depreciate as the US dollar appreciated, which
made the CNH value lower than the CNY.

Except for these two periods, the price spread between CNH and CNY is small since
the SPFTZ started. The market can operate more efficiently. This is evidence that the
financial liberalization of China has made some progress since SPFTZ, and the
effectiveness of capital controls is weaker.

4. The Effects of SPFTZ on China’s Capital Control: An Interest Parity Test

Although the price spread test is illuminating, we can conduct a formal price test by
analyzing the combination of onshore RMB interest rates, offshore US dollar interest

16

rates and non-deliverable forward (NDF1) exchange rates. If the differences between
onshore RMB interest rates and those implied by the offshore NDFs in conjunction with
US dollar Libor show a tendency to diminish, it will be direct support for the position
that the impact of capital controls is lower after the SPFTZ.

a) Theoretical Foundation

The theoretical base for such a price test is Interest Rate Parity, which requires the
revenue of the same money should be equal in different currencies if there is no capital
control. Therefore, the forward exchange rate of the home currency is linked by
arbitrage to its spot rate and the dollar offshore interest rate through the covered interest
parity condition:
F=

(1)

$

Where the F is the forward exchange rate of RMB, S is the spot rate of RMB, r is the
interest rate of RMB, and

$

is the offshore interest rate of dollar.

However, because there are capital controls in mainland China, non-residents may not
have full access to the onshore credit market. Since there is no capital control in
HKSAR, the NDF version of covered interest parity should hold:
NDF = S

1

$

(2)

The NDF is defined as a cash-settled, short-term forward contract on a thinly traded or non-convertible foreign
currency, where the profit or loss at the time at the settlement date is calculated by taking the difference
between the agreed upon exchange rate and the spot rate at the time of settlement, for an agreed upon notional
amount of funds.
17

where i is the NDF-implied yield of RMB offshore:
i=

1+

$

−1

(3)

There can be a significant difference between r and i if capital controls are highly
effective. Therefore, the onshore and offshore interest rate spread

−

is an

indication of the impact of cross-border capital controls.

b) Data Description

In order to perform the price test, we need to carefully choose the financial instruments
for their maturity, credit and liquidity. If the instruments share the same maturity, issued
by the same private parties, and enjoy the same liquidity, the price test can work better.
We choose Shibor, the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, as the domestic interest rate.
Shibor is computed by the interbank offer rates of 18 main banks in China, and is
regarded as the benchmark rate in the money market. The Shibor rates include overnight,
one week, two weeks, one month, three months, six months, nine months and one year.
Shibor rates shorter than three months are mainly determined by supply and demand in
the money market, while those equal and longer than three months are determined more
by expectation of future interest rates.

To compute the implied interest rate in the offshore market, we need the spot and NDF
exchange rates of RMB, as well as the US dollar offshore interest rates. Spot exchange
18

rates of RMB are easy to obtain, and the Libor rates are suitable for dollar offshore
interest rates. As to the NDF exchange rates, there are currently four NDF markets for
the dollar-RMB transactions, namely New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore.
We choose the NDF rates in Hong Kong as it is the largest NDF market.

In order to minimize the mismatch between different data sources, all the data are drawn
from the DZH database2. The data period is from October 8, 2006, the beginning date
of Shibor data, to the latest trade date when we executed this study, November 6, 2014.

19

subtracting the implied offshore rates from domestic Shibor rates. If compared with the
study of Ma (2008) for the period 1999 to 2006, we find that the yield gap seldom
reached 6 percent after 2006, while it often exceeded 8 percent before that. This is
consistent with Ma (2008) that the yield gap has narrowed since the July 2005 policy
change, when the PBoC announced that RMB will peg to a basket of currencies rather
than the US dollar and can float according to market supply and demand.

The evolution of RMB yield gaps in Fig.6 moves through several phases. The first is
from September 2007 to the end of 2008, when the gaps peaked in March 2008. The
second phase is from early 2009 to the end of 2011, when the gaps increased steadily
from minus 1.5% to 5%. The third phase is from January 2012 to the end of 2014, when
the gaps maintain a relatively narrow change between 2.6% to 5.3%.

Formal statistical analysis can say more precisely what is the effect of SPFTZ on such
yield gaps. We split the data period T into two sub-periods: the first period
before SPFTZ, from 2006/10/08 to 2013/09/30, and the second period

SPFTZ, from 2013/10/01 to the latest trade day in our study, 2014/11/06. We regress
the absolute value of yield gap to time, and see whether there is any trend change since
the founding of the SPFTZ.

Note: Y is the absolute value of 3-month onshore/offshore yield gap, T is time trend.

From Table 4 we can make the following observations. Firstly, the yield gap is different
from zero, which means there are still effective capital controls in China. Secondly, the
start of the SPFTZ has alleviated capital controls. In the whole period there is a time
trend for the absolute yield gap to increase (0.0018), but since the start of the SPFTZ
this trend has changed to a decrease (－0.0038). A dummy +! = 1 when the time
period is

equals －0.2936. Thirdly, there is a regime break on the last day of

September 2013, when the SPFTZ was founded. If we do a Chow Test using the ESS,
we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no structural change between the two
periods.

5. The Effects of SPFTZ on China’s Capital Control: A Granger Causality Test

a) Theoretical Foundation

Our last test on the effects of the SPFTZ employs a Granger causality test based on
VAR model. The theoretical basis of such test is quite straightforward, as expressed in
Huang (2014). If the capital control were totally effective, we may expect the expansion
of China’s monetary supply can only affect transmission internationally through trade
channels such as production, exports, investments, instead of financial channels
including interest rates and exchange rates. In fact, using data from the period 20002012, Huang (2014) finds that the international transmission of the PBoC’s balance
sheet expansion is more through “trade channels” than through “financial channels.”

There are three types of methodologies for empirical examination of the international
transmission mechanisms of monetary policy: simulation experiments, dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, and the VAR approach. The advantage
of a VAR model is that it requires minimal identifying restrictions on the underlying
Chinese economic structure, which may differ significantly from the standard theory3.

The difference between us and Huang (2014) lies in that we check the expansion of

China’s M2 rather than the PBoC’s balance sheet. In China’s financial system the
commercial banks play an important role in monetary policy practices, especially the
so called “Big Four”4. In Fig.2 (see page 3) we can see the M2 increase ratio is more
stable than that of M0 or M1. Therefore the PBoC’s balance sheet may not be an
adequate representation of China’s monetary expansion.

b) Data description

We study the relations between China’s M2 ratio increase and the interest rates of the
US and Japan. The US interest rate is the monthly average of federal fund rates, and the
Japanese interest rate is the average of commercial loan rates. The sample period is
from August 2008, the beginning month of China’s M2 data available, to the latest
Japanese exchange rate we can get, August 2014. Altogether there are 37 months of
data. All the data are drawn from the DZH database, and the data trends are depicted in
Fig.7.

Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank.

From Fig.7 we can see while the M2 of China expanded monthly at a high speed of 14%
to 16%, the interest rates of both the US and Japan show a decreasing trend. Of course
such a decrease may result from the quantitative easing of the US Fed and the Japan’s
Abenomics financial policy, without much relevance to China’s monetary expansion.
Only by econometric analysis can we say whether there is Granger causality between
China’s M2 increase and the interest rates of the US and Japan.

c) Granger Causality Test

We analyze a VAR model with three variables, China’s M2 increase ratio, the US
interest rate and Japan’s interest rate. We make two Granger tests, one using the data
between period 2011m8 to 2013m9, before the start of the SPFTZ (VAR1); the other
using all the samples (VAR2). We wish to see whether there is any change in the
Granger causalities among the variables. All the necessary tests for time series are
24

fulfilled. Table 5 reports the main test results.

Notes: Those variables that are not significant at a 10% level in both VAR models are
omitted.
From Table 5 we can see that, before the start of the SPFTZ (model VAR1) both interest
rates of the US and Japan are Granger causes of China’s M2, but the M2 is only the
Granger cause of the interest rate in the US at a relatively low significance (9.2%). After
the SPFTZ (model VAR2), the significance of the US interest rate as the Granger cause
of China’s M2 is higher, from 5.5% to 1%; so is the reverse causality that China’s M2
as the Granger cause of US interest rate, from 9.2% to 6.4%. The Chinese financial
market is connected to the international market more closely. This is likely because the
capital flow in and out of China is becoming easier after the start of the SPFTZ.

6. Concluding Remarks

25

In this paper we discuss preliminary evidence as to the effects of the SPFTZ on China’s
capital controls. China still maintains relatively rigorous capital controls to keep the
exchange rate stable along with monetary policy independence. But the foreign reserve
accumulation and money supply induced has presented China with a dilemma. The start
of the SPFTZ is a trial to introduce a middle combination of exchange rate floating and
capital account liberalization.

We employ three methods to test the SPFTZ’s impact on capital controls: price spread
tests between CNH and CNY, RMB yield gaps between onshore and offshore markets,
and Granger causalities among China’s money supply and the foreign interest rates. All
these tests give consistent results that the impact of capital controls is lower since the
SPFTZ.

With the further successful practice of the SPFTZ and more pilot policies replicated in
China as a whole, we can anticipate China’s capital control will diminish further in the
following decade. China will likely choose floating exchange rate, free capital account
and independent monetary policy, just as other developed economies do, including the
United States, the European Union and Japan.
