    "abstract": "\n\nThis study shows that the demographic and institutional origins of new US trained science and engineering PhDs changed markedly between the late 1960s-1970s to the 1990s-early 2000s. In 1966, 71% of science and engineering PhD graduates were US-born males, 6% were US-born females, and 23% were foreign born. In 2000, 36% of the graduates were US-born males, 25% were US-born females, and 39% were foreign born. Between 1970 and 2000 most of the growth in PhDs was in less prestigious smaller doctorate programs. The undergraduate origins of bachelor's obtaining science and engineering PhDs changed only modestly among US colleges and universities while there was a huge growth in the number of foreign bachelor's graduates obtaining US PhDs.\n\n",
