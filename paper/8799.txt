Publicly Provided Education

JEL No. H4, I2

ABSTRACT
Historically, most attention in public programs has been given to the resources devoted to the
activity, and resources have been used to index both commitment and quality. Education differs from
other areas of public expenditure because direct measures of outcomes are available, making it is possible
to consider results and, by implication, to consider the efficiency of provision. Early interpretations of
the evidence, emanating from popular interpretations of the Coleman Report that “schools do not make
a difference,” are incorrect, but the basic evidence behind the statement suggests serious performance
problems of government supply, because purchased inputs to schools are not closely related to outcomes.
This paper reviews that evidence along with providing an evaluation of the various controversial aspects
including issues of causality, consumer behavior, and estimation approaches. Two detailed policy areas
are discussed in terms of the evidence on performance: public versus private provision and the financing
of schools.

The provision of education is a major public sector activity around the world, and both developed
and developing nations frequently act as if ensuring an appropriate education ranks close in priority to
providing for the safety and security of their citizens. And, much like these other fundamental areas,
governments not only provide a majority of the funding for schools but also typically operate the schools.
The objectives of this essay include not only a consideration of the purposes and rationale for governmental
involvement in schooling but also an evaluation of performance in addressing the underlying goals.
Even though government’s presence in education is commonly accepted without much question, the
degree and form of involvement warrants attention. The amount and quality of education is known to
contribute to the income and well-being of individuals. Recent analyses also suggest that education has a
powerful effect on the strength and growth of national economies. These factors do not, however,
necessarily justify the extent or manner of governmental involvement.
Regardless of one’s opinion about the involvement of government, it is valuable to assess how well
government does at providing education. Historically, most attention in public programs has been given to
the resources devoted to the activity, and resources have been used to index both commitment and quality.
Such a perspective, while forced on many areas of governmental activity by lack of good measures of
outcomes, is obviously quite limited. Importantly, education increasingly differs from other areas of public
expenditure because direct measures of outcomes are becoming more readily available. Thus, instead of
measuring governmental human capital investments just by expenditure, it is possible to consider results
and, by implication, to consider the efficiency of provision. Such consideration reveals a complicated
picture of expenditure patterns that are not matched by performance, although the conclusions and policy
implications to be derived from this general finding are not straightforward. Because of the ability to
consider performance directly, the study of publicly provided educational services also provides a possible
window on one of the critical policy questions that continuously arises in mixed economies: how well does
government do in directing society’s resources to meet its public goals? Nonetheless, given our current

1

state of knowledge, considerable uncertainty necessarily remains about whether or not any inefficiencies of
the educational system are typical of governmentally provided services.
The distribution of educational outcomes is also an element of any evaluation of educational
performance. Education is not a pure public good, available without diminution to all. Instead, it is a
complicated intermediate good that is partially produced by government through provision that varies across
local jurisdictions and that that interacts with the endowments and actions of students and families.
Substantial portions of the rewards of more schooling accrue directly to the individual. Thus, education has
more of the character of a publicly provided private good. As such, the distribution of outcomes is not only
an important concern in judging the performance of government provision but also an object of policy.
Education clearly encompasses a wider variety of things than can be readily covered here. The
central issues analyzed are the organization, financing, and production of educational services. This
discussion is placed within the context of the role of government in intervening in the market for education.
The following section more fully delineates the scope of this investigation and provides a roadmap through
the subsequent discussions.

Scope and Roadmap for Discussion
This essay comes in the midst of a rapidly expanding analytical base on the economics of education.
The importance attached to human capital in many areas of economic research plus the intense policy
concerns about schooling have heightened interest in scholarly exploration of the education sector per se. A
primary purpose of this overall discussion is to highlight the most promising lines of research and to project
future areas of productive research. In doing this, some limits on the scope of this endeavor are necessary.
Much of the discussion centers on experiences in the United States with the provision of primary
and secondary education. This focus permits a clear development of the issues of service delivery that can
be based on a very extensive analytical base. It is, nonetheless, a somewhat arbitrary delineation of the
overall set of potential topics. Although the provision of formal schooling by government includes
extensive interventions in tertiary education, higher education involves quite different institutional
2

structures. More importantly, little progress has been made in the measurement of outcomes of higher
education, thus precluding direct analysis of the financing and production issues that are central to this
analysis.1
The restriction to formal schooling situations excludes important aspects of human capital
investment. Most countries have governmental involvement in various aspects of job training, including
both formal vocational training and work with private employers. This involvement ranges from
governmentally provided training programs to interventions in apprentice programs arranged directly with
firms. The institutional structure of such programs differs widely across countries, but it is frequently more
closely linked to the labor ministries of government than to the education ministries. This separation of
function, while perhaps unfortunate from an overall policy perspective, implies that the issues and analyses
of training programs have developed very differently from those related to formal schooling.2 This analysis
also generally follows the American custom of separating preschool programs from formal schooling.
Again, however, a full treatment of human capital investment policies should span this period, because there
is some indication that investments early have high pay-offs, and some discussion is provided below.3
The restriction generally to U.S. experience is an unfortunate limitation forced by the availability of
comparable studies from other countries and other institutional experiences. The wide international
variation in governmental institutions should be and is an advantage for some analyses. While the

1

As developed below, the largest issues in primary and secondary education are whether or not various
structures and financing schemes lead to qualitative differences in the performance of schools. For primary and
secondary education, a variety of readily available measures of student outcomes, including test scores and differential
labor market performance, permits direct analyses. But, no similar measures of higher education outcomes – beyond
pure quantity differences – are available and accepted. A few attempts to look at labor market outcomes of higher
educational quality are available (e.g., Solmon (1973); Sewell and Hauser (1975); James and Alsalam (1993);
Behrman, Rosenzweig, and Taubman (1996); Behrman et al. (1998); Eide, Brewer, and Ehrenberg (1998); Dale and
Krueger (1999)), but the field remains largely undeveloped.

consideration of optimal human capital investment across the life cycle, see Heckman, Lochner, and Taber (2000).

limitation is rapidly disappearing with significant data development and analytic efforts around the world,
the more limited range of analyses that are currently available makes in-depth consideration of the
international similarities and differences impossible to develop in depth. To the extent possible,
comparisons with both developed and developing countries are made throughout this discussion, but they
generally cannot be summarized and organized as clearly as the United States experiences.
The discussion begins with an overview of stylized facts about schooling and with a discussion of
how human capital enters into overall economic output and performance. A consideration of the conceptual
basis for governmental involvement in education follows this.
The performance of government in providing education is a central element to the entire
interpretation of both research and policy in this area. Beginning with a general conceptual model of the
educational production process, detailed attention is given to what research has said about the effectiveness
of inputs to education. This summary of analytical studies leads naturally to discussion of potential
analytical issues that arise in the area and to how one might interpret the range of results.
The study of school performance is related to a variety of organizational issues that are key
elements of governmental intervention and participation in education. Two of the most significant
organizational aspects are the relationship between public schools and private schools and the form and
means of financing education. The substantial literatures on each provide insights into these significant
policy choices.
Finally, even though there is rapid expansion of research in this area, a number of areas remain
underexplored. The last section identifies a series of issues that appear to be productive areas for the
continual development of the area.

Overview of Schooling Issues
Economists generally view schooling as an investment both by students and by the society at large.
Each incurs costs, and each reap rewards. For a student, the costs of education include the direct costs of
tuition, books, and other school-related expenditures as well as the income that the student forgoes when
attending school instead of taking a paying job. Similarly society incurs direct costs in subsidizing a school
system that provides free or heavily subsidized education to its citizens. It also forgoes the opportunity to
devote the skills, people and resources that are engaged in education to other projects. This viewpoint –
regarding education as an investment – dates back to the 17th century with the writings of Sir William Petty
and includes work by Adam Smith and other influential economists (see Kiker (1968)). It was brought into
mainstream economics, however, by Schultz (1961, 1963), Becker (1993), and Mincer (1970, 1974) and
has become the basis of a steady stream of subsequent theoretical and empirical analyses.

Quantity of Schooling
A look at the history of the twentieth century suggests that schooling has generally been a good
investment, buoyed by steady increases in the demand for skilled workers. Individuals have dramatically
increased their own investments in education.
In the United States, at the beginning of the twentieth century, only six percent of the adult
population had finished high school. After the first world war, high school graduation rates began to
increase rapidly. But changes in education work their way only slowly through the overall population. By
1940, only half of Americans aged 25 or older had completed more than eight years of school, that is, had
had any high-school education at all. Not until 1967 did attainment of the median adult aged 25 or over
exceed high school.4 Since 1967, however, the increase in the number of years of schooling completed by
Americans has slowed. The young adult population, aged 25 to 29, has had stable completion rates for

4

See U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975, 2000) and Goldin (1998).
5

almost two decades. At the turn of the 21st century, over 80 percent of Americans over 25 had completed
high school or more.
The changes in other nations have been even more dramatic. Table 1 shows the percentages of
different age groups completing upper secondary schools for a sample of more developed countries.5 The
different age groups effectively trace the normal schooling in different decades in the past, so that the
changes with age show the rate of increase in schooling. While the United States has been stable since the
1960s, most of the other countries have undergone massive increases in high school completion – mirroring
the historical developments in the U.S. before and immediately after World War II (Goldin (1998)).
The benefits of education to individuals are also clear. The average incomes of workers with a high
school education remain significantly above those of the less educated, and the average income of workers
with a college education now dwarf those of the high-school educated. In the U.S., the rapidly increasing
earnings of college-educated workers during the past two decades currently provides them with a premium
of more than 70 percent higher earnings than a high school graduate with similar job experience.6
The earnings patterns elsewhere in the world appear quantitatively more varied, but there is a strong
similarity in the earnings effects associated with more schooling. Table 2 shows earnings distributions by
level of schooling and by gender across the adult labor force, again for a sample of developed countries.
While the earning distribution is more compressed in some countries than others – probably reflecting
characteristics of labor markets – invariably there are obvious gains in earnings to more schooling. Not only
are wages higher for the better educated, but they also tend to enjoy greater job opportunities and suffer less
unemployment (U.S. Department of Education (1996a); Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (2001)).

A comprehensive comparison of schooling across nations can be found in Barro and Lee (2001).

More detail on the patterns of earnings can be found in Murphy and Welch (1989, 1992), Kosters (1991),
Pierce and Welch (1996), and Deere (2001). McMahon (1991) reports slightly lower private rates of return for high
school completion than for college completion, although they remain substantial. These calculations all rely on just
salary differentials, and greater equality in the provision of fringe benefits may act to compress the differences for
total compensation. However, no analysis of schooling returns in terms of total compensation is available.
6

For individuals the increased relative incomes of more educated people have been sufficient to
offset the costs. An individual can expect significant financial benefit from extended schooling, even after
appropriately considering costs.7 Individuals also gain non-financial benefits from education. For example,
there is evidence that more educated people make better choices concerning health, so they tend to live
longer and to have healthier lives. There is also evidence that the children of more educated parents get
more out of school. They attend longer and learn more. Such benefits of schooling simply reinforce those
from the labor market.8
The common interpretation of the overall returns is that high technology economies produce large
demands for skilled workers, workers who can adapt to new technologies and manage complicated
production processes effectively. Formal models with this character are developed in Nelson and Phelps
(1966) and Welch (1970) and summarized in the ideas of dealing with disequilibrium in Schultz (1975).
Society as a whole also benefits from education. National income rises directly with earnings from
workers with more and better skills. The more educated are more prone to be civically involved, to vote in

7

While most economists think of schooling as involving the production of human capital in individuals, the
screening or signaling perspective is a clear alternative (e.g., Spence (1973), Wolpin (1977), Weiss (1995)). The
screening model in the extreme suggests that individuals begin schooling with differing abilities and that schooling
merely allows employers to identify those with more ability. From the individual’s viewpoint, it does not matter what
the source of earnings enhancement is, be it production by schools or screening. The individual will be equally
induced to make schooling investments based on the comparison of returns and costs. The two may, however, yield
quite different incentives to governments to invest, because signaling may lead to different social and private returns
to schooling. As a general matter, these models are not identified with just labor market outcome data. A variety of
specialized tests under different maintained assumptions about individual motivations and firm behavior have been
conducted but have not provided clear support for screening. These tests include looking for “sheepskin effects,”
particularly high returns to completing given institutional levels, as in Layard and Psacharopoulos (1974). Some
support of screening does come from analysis of incentives to complete high school when there are fewer college
graduates Bedard (2001). See Riley (2001) for a review of general theoretical and empirical work. The key difficulty
with these tests, however, remains that they focus on labor market outcomes, where the private returns to schooling
are generally expected to exist independent of the underlying causal mechanism. The analysis below concentrates
importantly on outcomes that relate directly to the schooling process (the point where the two models are
hypothesized to differ significantly).
8

See, for example, Michael (1982); Haveman and Wolfe (1984); Wolfe and Zuvekas (1995); and Leibowitz
(1974). Many factors are unclear, however, because of questions of causality; see, for example, Farrell and Fuchs
(1982).

local and national elections, and to be a better informed and more responsible electorate.9 Increases in the
level of education are associated with reductions in crime (e.g., Ehrlich (1975), Lochner and Moretti
(2001)).
Recent economic studies argue that education may provide economic benefits to society greater
than the sum of its benefits to individuals – by providing a rich environment for innovation, scientific
discovery, education can accelerate the growth rate of the economy; see, for example, the analyses of
growth by Lucas (1988), Romer (1990a), Barro (1991), Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1992), and Barro and
Sala-I-Martin (1995). The growth effects depending on the aggregate level of education in the economy
enter as an externality to the individual. (Estimation by Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), however, questions
this effect, at least at the state level).
Education appears also to have helped to achieve both greater social equality and greater equity in
the distribution of economic resources. Schooling was a centerpiece of the U.S. War on Poverty in the
1960s, and the benefits of improved schooling are demonstrated in comparisons of the earnings of different
social and ethnic groups. Earnings by blacks and whites have converged noticeably since the Second World
War, and much of this convergence is attributable to improved educational opportunities for
African-Americans (see Smith and Welch (1989); Jaynes and Williams (1989)). However, as discussed
below, that convergence slowed down noticeably in the 1980s with skill differences being cited as a prime
determinant (Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993)).
Nonetheless, while there are many well-documented associations between amount of schooling –
either individually or in the aggregate – and desirable economic outcomes, significant questions remain
about the magnitude and interpretation of these relationships. First, the association may misstate the causal

The pattern of U.S. voting over time can be found inStanley and Niemi (2000). An analysis of the partial
effects of educational attainment (which are positive in the face of overall declines in voter turnout over time) is
presented in Teixeira (1992).

impact of changes in schooling for individuals and the aggregate.10 Second, the average effects may not
correspond to the marginal effects. Third, in general externalities have been notoriously elusive and
difficult to estimate convincingly, and education proves to be no exception. Finally, the measurement
issues, as highlighted in the next section, are significant. Each of these topics (with the possible exception
of the last) has received surprisingly limited research and is a fertile area for future work. In many contexts,
they are key to both analytical and policy concerns.

Quality Considerations
For most of the 20th century, the U.S. debate over the economic consequences of schooling
concentrated on the amount of school attained or, simply, the quantity of schooling of the population. Policy
deliberations focused on school completion rates, on the proportion of the population attending
postsecondary schooling, and the like. And analyses of the benefits of schooling were most concerned with
the effects of quantity of schooling—whether benefits are seen in terms of individual incomes or social
benefits like improved voting behavior of citizens.
Most policy and analytical attention has now switched to quality dimensions of schooling. In the
United States, with the slowing of individual income growth11 and of income convergence by race,12
improving the quality of schooling, or how much is learned for each year, has been seen as the natural
policy focus. Similar concerns, albeit generally with a lag, have diffused to other developed and developing
countries.

10

For example, Bils and Klenow (2000) question the importance of education as a cause of growth, as
opposed to the relationship going the other way around. See also the perspectives in Mankiw, Romer, and Weil
(1992) and Benhabib and Spiegel (1994). At the individual level, see Card (1999).
11

See, for example, Levy and Murnane (1992) for a review of U.S. earnings patterns. See also Welch (1999)
for an update and interpretation of distributional patterns.
12

Discussion of distributional issues including earnings differences by race can be found in Smith and Welch
(1989), O'Neill (1990), Card and Krueger (1992b), Levy and Murnane (1992), Bound and Freeman (1992), Boozer,
Krueger, and Wolkon (1992),Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993), Hauser (1993), Kane (1994), Grogger (1996), Welch
(1999), and Deere (2001).

The economic effects of differences in the quality of graduates of our elementary and secondary
schools are much less understood than the effects of quantity, particularly with regard to the performance of
the aggregate economy. The incomplete understanding of the effects of educational quality clearly reflects
difficulties in measurement. Although quality of education is hard to define precisely, it is natural to use the
term quality to refer to the knowledge base and analytical skills that are the focal point of schools.
Moreover, to add concreteness to this discussion, much of the discussion will rely on information provided
by standardized tests of academic achievement and ability.
Relying on standardized tests to provide measures of quality is controversial—in part because of
gaps in available evidence and in part because of the conclusions that tend to follow (as discussed below).
The contrasting view emphasizes measuring "quality" by the resources (i.e., inputs) going into schooling.
Early investigations include Wachtel (1975), Akin and Garfinkel (1977), and Rizzuto and Wachtel (1980).
Most recent along this line is Card and Krueger (1992a); see also the reviews of the discussion in Burtless
(1996b) and Betts (1996). In the context of developing countries, where these issues might be more
important, see Behrman and Birdsall (1983). A substantial part of the controversy relates to the adequacy or
effectiveness of expenditure or resource measures as a proxy for worker skills (as discussed below). In the
end, cognitive skill measures appear to be the best available indicators of quality and do relate to outcomes
that we care about, where resource measures are quite inadequate.
A variety of studies of the labor market have been concerned about how individual differences in
cognitive ability affect earnings and specifically modify the estimated returns to quantity. The early work
was subsumed under the general topic of "ability bias" in the returns to schooling. In that, the simple
question was whether the tendency of more able individuals to continue in school led to an upward bias in
the estimated returns to school (because of a straightforward omitted variables problem).13 These studies

13

See, for example, Griliches (1974). More recently, see Taber (2001). Discussions of alternative
approaches to dealing with ability bias can be found in Card (1999). That discussion in general does not consider
school quality, although some of the formulations could be recast in that way.
10

have focused on the estimated returns to years of schooling, although that seems to be a badly formulated
question. The correction most commonly employed was the inclusion of a cognitive ability or cognitive
achievement measure in the earnings function estimates. In interpreting that work, one must believe that
quantity of schooling is uncorrelated with quality as measured by tests of cognitive ability and achievement.
These studies, nonetheless, provide insight into quality measurement issues through their common
control for cognitive effects on earnings. The results of the early work generally indicated relatively modest
impacts of variations in cognitive ability after holding constant quantity of schooling.14 In this work, there
was no real discussion of what led to any observed cognitive differences, although much of the work
implicitly treated it as innate, and not very related to variations in schooling.15 Further, all of the early work
relied on generally small and nonrepresentative samples of the population.
The most recent direct investigations of cognitive achievement, however, have generally suggested
larger labor market returns to measured differences in cognitive achievement. For example, Bishop (1989,
1991), O'Neill (1990), Grogger and Eide (1993), Murnane, Willett, and Levy (1995), Neal and Johnson
(1996), Currie and Thomas (2000), Murnane et al. (2000), and Murnane et al. (2001) each find that the
earnings advantages to higher achievement on standardized tests are quite substantial.16 These results are
derived from quite different approaches. Bishop (1989) considers the measurement errors that are inherent
in most testing situation and demonstrates that careful treatment of that problem has a dramatic effect on the

14

This limited impact of cognitive achievement was also central to a variety of direct analyses of schooling
that reformulated the earnings determination process such as Jencks et al. (1972) and Bowles and Gintis (1976) and
Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001).
15

Manski (1993a) represents one strand more recent work with this same general thrust. He recasts the issue
as a selection problem and considers how ability or quality interacts with earnings expectations to determine
continuation in schooling. Currently, however, no empirical work along these lines identifies the quantitative
importance of selection or the interaction of school quality and earnings in such models.
16

Outside of the United States, few studies are available. One exception for developing countries that finds
significant effects of cognitive skills on income is Boissiere, Knight, and Sabot (1985). The NAS/NRC study on
employment tests Hartigan and Wigdor (1989) also supports the view of a significant relationship of tests and
employment outcomes, although the strength of the relationship appears somewhat less strong than that in the direct
earnings investigations. Nonetheless, it seems likely that, for the purposes here, the GATB may not be a good
measure of the cognitive outcomes of schools and may not correspond well to standard measures of cognitive
11

estimated importance of test differences. O'Neill (1990), Bishop (1991), Grogger and Eide (1993), and
Neal and Johnson (1996) on the other hand, simply rely upon more recent labor market data along with
more representative sampling and suggest that the earnings advantage to measured skill differences is larger
than that found in earlier time periods and in earlier studies (even without correcting for test reliability).
Currie and Thomas (2000) provide evidence for a sample of British youth and rely on a long panel of
representative data. Murnane et al. (2001), considering a comparison over time, demonstrate that the results
of increased returns to measured skills hold regardless of the methodology (i.e., whether simple analysis or
error-corrected estimation). Murnane et al. (2000) and Murnane et al. (2001) provide further evidence of
the effects of cognitive skills (although offering some caution in the interpretation of strength of cognitive
effects versus other traits). Ultimately, the difficulty of separating cognitive skills from pure schooling has
made this estimation very difficult (Cawley et al. (2000), Heckman and Vytlacil (2001)) and leaves
ambiguity about the exact magnitude of effects.
An additional part of the return to school quality comes through continuation in school. There is
substantial evidence that students who do better in school, either through grades or scores on standardized
achievement tests, tend to go farther in school (see, for example, Dugan (1976); Manski and Wise (1983).
Rivkin (1995) finds that variations in test scores capture a considerable proportion of the systematic
variation in high school completion and in college continuation. Indeed, Rivkin (1995) finds that test score
differences fully explain black-white differences in schooling. Bishop (1991) and Hanushek, Rivkin, and
Taylor (1996)find that individual achievement scores are highly correlated with school attendance.
Behrman et al. (1998) find strong achievement effects on both continuation into college and quality of
college; moreover, the effects are larger when proper account is taken of the endogeneity of achievement.
Hanushek and Pace (1995), using the High School and Beyond data, find that college completion is
significantly related to higher test scores at the end of high school.
This work, while less complete than might be desired, leads to a conclusion that variations in

achievement.

12

cognitive ability, as measured by standardized tests, are important in career success. Variation in measured
cognitive ability is far from everything that is important, but it is significant in a statistical and quantitative
sense.
The linkage of individual cognitive skills to aggregate productivity growth is more difficult to
establish. There is no clear consensus on the underlying causes of improvements in the overall productivity
of the United States economy, nor on how the quality of workers interacts with economic growth.17 The
analysis of the impact of schooling quality on cross-country differences in growth by Hanushek and Kimko
(2000), however, suggests that quality may be very important and could even dominate effects of the
quantity of schooling differences across countries. They develop measures of labor force quality based on
several different international mathematics and science tests and then find these to be highly correlated with
international differences in growth rates. The concern in such work is the direction of causality. While a
series of specification tests in Hanushek and Kimko (2000) indicates that there is a causal relationship
between quality and growth, the exact magnitude of the effect is open to question.
Parallel to the work on individual wage determination, a number of studies have also pursued how
school resource differences correlate with economic growth. These differences, however, have not shown a
close relationship with international growth (see Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995), Hanushek and Kimko
(2000), and Barro and Lee (2001).

One observation is useful, however. When looking at the history of productivity increase in the United
States economy, several distinct time periods stand out. Productivity growth continued at some two percent per year
through the 1960s, but fell off subsequently - first to one percent in the 1970s and then to virtually zero in the 1980s.
It subsequently rebounded in the 1990s. Noting that productivity changes in these time periods through the 1980s
mirror the aggregate pattern of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, which fell dramatically from 1964 through
1980 before partially recovering, some have gone on to presume that the test scores are driving the productivity
changes. Such could not, however, be the case -- since, as Bishop (1989) makes clear, the test takers with lower scores
remained a small proportion of the total labor force through the 1980s. Lower test scores in the 1980s may signal
forthcoming problems, but they cannot be an explanation for past changes in the economy.

Aggregate Resources and School Outcomes
School policy in the United States and elsewhere has focused attention on quality issues and desires
to improve student outcomes. It is useful in this light then to consider briefly how this policy attention has
shown up and what the results have been. The simplest picture comes from the aggregate data.
The concern in the United States about the quality of schooling has undoubtedly contributed to the
growth in spending on schools. The U.S. has increased the resources devoted to students dramatically over
the entire 20th century, with per pupil spending rising at 3½ percent per year in real terms for a 100-year
period (Hanushek and Rivkin (1997)). Importantly, between 1960 and 1995 when performance become
available, real spending per pupil tripled.18 Clearly some of this recent expenditure was required simply to
compete with other sectors for highly educated women and does not represent an expansion of school
activities, but, even allowing for this, expenditure shows a strong trend.19
While U.S. spending on education has increased significantly during the last quarter of century,
quality of student performance measured by test performance has remained roughly constant. Beginning in
1970, the United States embarked on an extensive testing program for students, the National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP), that was designed to track performance over time. It appears that the
performance of U.S. 17-year-olds has remained roughly constant over the thirty-year period of observation.

18

The measurement of real increases in resources has been the subject of some controversy and is difficult to
do with precision. The preceding calculations deflate nominal spending by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This is
an output price index and is likely to diverge from an appropriate input price indices. Education is a labor intensive
industry, which historically has shown little productivity improvement. The consumer price, or alternatively the GDP
deflator, indicate how much of society’s resources are being devoted to schooling. But, because of real wage
increases in the economy, input costs in the education sector are likely to rise more rapidly than the CPI, so that the
CPI-adjusted increases will overstate the increases in real inputs to education (e.g., Scitovsky and Scitovsky (1959) or
Baumol (1967)). Rothstein and Miles (1995) suggest an alternative approach of using a modified service-sector CPI.
This approach– based on a different measure of output prices emphasizing the service sector–cannot, however, solve
the problem of obtaining more accurate measures of input prices, although it can provide a means of developing
comparisons of productivity change across labor-intensive sectors (Hanushek (1997b)). While development of
accurate input price indices is difficult because of issues of quality measurement for teachers, the difference between
CPI-adjusted and input-adjusted measures is important to keep in mind. Use of a simple wage index or of a measure
of increases in salaries for college graduates nonetheless still shows large real resource increases.

See Flyer and Rosen (1997) for a discussion of the competing forces on teacher labor markets.

The simple comparison of NAEP scores from the early 1970s through the 1990s, shows lower science
scores, roughly the same reading scores, and higher math scores.20 Obviously, a variety of factors could
influence the aggregate pattern of performance and costs, including for example changes in the student
population or the structure of schools–topics discussed below. Nonetheless, the aggregate comparison of
resources and performance creates a prima facie case that performance of public schools warrants careful
consideration.
While the United States remains near the top of all nations in terms of spending per pupil, a number
of other countries now spend similar amounts or even greater amounts. Table 3 displays estimates of both
the absolute levels of spending and the proportion of GDP per capita devoted to primary and secondary
schooling.21 The comparison of spending patterns across countries shows considerable variation, part of
which might be accounted for by higher proportions of private spending for schooling.22
Interestingly, the amount of spending internationally does not have a very close relationship to the
performance of students. Table 4 displays national scores of eighth graders and twelfth graders on the Third
International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), conducted in 1995. Countries are rank ordered
from highest to lowest in each and compared to performance in the United States. (Bold indicates

20

The earliest NAEP test date differs by subject area with the first science test in 1969, first reading test in
1971, and first math test in 1973. Tests have been given approximately every four years and also involve earlier ages.
Each of the subject areas has exhibited some change over the entire time period, and, while only endpoints are
reported, it is also true that each of the tests has been roughly flat during the 1990s. See U.S. Department of
Education (2000).
21

Such comparisons across countries are clearly difficult to do with any precision. The absolute spending
patterns require an international exchange rate, but even then are prone to inaccuracies because of differences in
teacher labor markets. Further, countries differ in what is included in statistics for spending on schools. The GDP
comparisons get around the exchange rate issues but suffer from lack of any models of how spending should change
with national income. See U.S. Department of Education (1996b) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (2001).
22

Data on private expenditures are difficult to find on a consistent and complete basis. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (2001) tabulations for developed countries display private spending in the
form of tuition and other expenditures on private schools. But they leave out private tutoring which appears to
represent a significant investment in a variety of countries – mostly notably the East Asian countries. Moreover,
countries use different definitions of what is included in school expenditures, of the age period for schooling, and the
like. The OECD analysis attempts to standardize data collection, but this is obviously difficult to do completely.

significantly above the U.S., and italics indicates significantly below the U.S.). Clearly, national scores are
not closely related to the spending rankings in the previous table. More systematic investigation reveals the
same results: Performance on the international tests is not closely related to resources of the school systems
in these countries.23
The overview of education attainment, spending, and performance demonstrates the importance of
schooling to individuals along with the commitments of governments to the provision of schooling. This
provides a backdrop for consideration of government’s involvement.

Role of Government
As is well-known, the existence of large returns to quantity or quality of schooling does not by itself
warrant large scale governmental involvement. Large returns imply that individuals have strong incentives
to obtain schooling, without the intervention of government. There are several primary justifications
generally given for the level of governmental involvement in education: externalities, economies of scale,
market failures in general, and redistributive motives. In the presence of these, purely private decisions are
unlikely to lead to optimal social decisions.
Externalities are frequently proposed as central to government’s interest in education. In general,
activities that are perceived to have significant externalities are prime candidates for increased governmental
support. With positive externalities, Pigouvian subsidies can be used so that individuals make decisions in
line with the appropriate social calculus. Or other governmental interventions might be used to move
toward a social optimum. But, as is also well recognized, externalities are noticeably elusive, and, while
optimal tax and subsidy policies in the face of externalities are well understood conceptually, few estimates
of the magnitude of externalities exist anywhere. Nevertheless, economists and citizens, if polled on

16

externalities in education, would probably support the view that education involves extensive externalities
(Cohn and Geske (1990)).
Leading candidates for areas of external benefits involve citizen involvement in the community and
government, crime reduction, family decision making and child upbringing, and economic growth. There is
evidence that more schooling does have a positive impact in each of these areas.
In each area, a significant portion of the beneficial effect of education appears to come from
comparing very low levels of school attainment with significantly higher levels. Thus, extensive
discussions of the social benefits of schooling in developing countries would seem both warranted and
correct.24 It is difficult to have, for example, a well-informed citizenry when most of the population is
illiterate. It may also be difficult to introduce advanced production technologies, at least in a timely manner,
if workers cannot be expected to read the accompanying technical manuals.
On the other hand, even if accepting the importance of externalities at minimal levels of schooling,
there is little reason to believe that there are constant marginal externalities when expanded on both the
extensive and intensive margins.25 Specifically, arguments about the social benefits of expanded education
seem much stronger in the case of developing countries of Africa than in the case of the United States
during the 21st century. Where half of the population has attended some postsecondary schooling, another
year of average schooling seems unlikely to change dramatically the political awareness of the U.S.
population. Similarly, if the average high school student scores somewhat higher on the National

24

Interestingly, policy discussions of education in developing countries tend to concentrate most on private
rates of return and the market outcomes of added schooling, even if they make some reference to other social benefits
such as political participation and lower fertility. See, for example, Heyneman and White (1986), Psacharopoulos,
Tan, and Jimenez (1986), and Lockheed and Verspoor (1991).
25

This issue is raised by Friedman (1962) and remains for the most part in the discussions of college
education in Hartman (1973) and Mundel (1973). None of these, however, provides empirical evidence on the
existence or magnitude of any externalities. The early primer on externalities in education (Weisbrod (1964))
concentrates chiefly on geographic spillovers and fiscal effects and downplays the issues raised here. A discussion of
the magnitude of externalities that is similar to the one here is found in Poterba (1996).
17

Assessment of Educational progress, it is doubtful that many would expect noticeable changes in the
identified extra social benefits of education.
Although education may be associated with a variety of social outcomes, a particularly relevant
question is whether there is a causal relationship or not. With very little done on even assessing the
magnitude of effects – largely because of poor measurement, progress on understanding the underlying
causal structure has been even more limited. For example, one of the few direct investigations of causation
indeed opens serious questions about common interpretations. Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) present
evidence on the role of mother’s education in the intergenerational transmission of skills. In this, they pay
particular attention to identifying the causal impact of mother’s education through use of identical twins and
conclude that it is not only much smaller than believed but possibly negative.26
A leading candidate for potential externalities of education in the United States and other developed
countries, however, would revolve around economic growth. If a highly skilled workforce permits entirely
different kinds of technologies to be introduced, or to be introduced earlier in a development cycle,
expanded education of an individual may indeed affect other workers in the economy. Or, if improved
abilities of the best students lead to more rapid invention and development of new technologies, spillovers
of educational investments may result. Nevertheless, little evidence exists that distinguishes externalities in
economic growth from simply the impact of better workers and more human capital.27
Beyond externalities, government also has a natural role when there are other market failures. The

most obvious possibility comes through capital market imperfections. If individuals cannot borrow against
their human capital – because human capital is embodied in the individual – there may be underinvestment
in education (cf. Becker (1993)). This possibility, only observable in postsecondary education when

26

For an early study of family effects, see Leibowitz (1974).

27

A recent consideration employs cross-sectional wage information to look at productivity spillovers and
finds little evidence after considering endogeneity of schooling (Acemoglu and Angrist (2000)). These issues can also
be found in discussions of endogenous growth models such as Nelson and Phelps (1966), Romer (1990b), Mankiw,
Romer, and Weil (1992), Benhabib and Spiegel (1994), and Hanushek and Kimko (2000).
18

government freely provides lower education, has not received strong empirical support (Cameron and
Heckman (1999)), but the current interventions in the market make it difficult to assess completely the
importance of this. Further, if there are economies of scale, say, from some fixed components of school
operations, governmental intervention may provide for efficient operations. Nonetheless, while the
empirical analysis is thin, little support for pervasive economies of scale exists.
An additional imperfection that deserves mention, and that enters into the discussion later, involves
information. Student achievement involves a complex mixture of educational inputs including the student’s
own abilities, the influence of parents and friends, and the impact of schools. These factors are not easily
separated, so that individuals themselves may have trouble assessing the independent influence of schools.
If such is the case, informational problems may impede the decision making of individuals in terms of
human capital investments. It may be that government can produce superior information about the quality
of school inputs than the individual – although, if this is the rationale for governmental involvement, the
form of intervention is important. In particular, government would not need to operate schools in order to
provide information about their performance.28
The second major category of justification for governmental intervention is a redistributive motive.
If society has certain goals for the distribution of income and well-being in society, normal market
operations are unlikely to achieve those goals. The precise form of societal goals and the relationship to
schooling has not been given much attention.29 (Note also that redistributive goals may also interact with

28

As mentioned before, a different aspect of information failures would relate to signaling and screening
models. A common interpretation of these models is that schooling does not increase productivity, it only identifies
more able people through their use of school attendance to convey their ability. In such a case, the social returns to
schooling may be considerably less than the private returns – indicating that government should work to lessen the
amount of costly schooling. Or, government may also not what to pursue programs designed to reduce school
dropouts if it lessens the information on individuals that is available.
29

Fair (1971) considers optimal policies for income distribution when it is an explicit component of the
social welfare function. Becker and Tomes (1976, 1979) concentrate on intergenerational aspects of income
transmission and distribution. Behrman, Taubman, and Pollak (1982) pursue intergenerational distribution issues from
an alternative model of parental behavior. Hanushek, Leung, and Yilmaz (2001) evaluate using education as a
redistributive device compared to the other mechanisms of negative income taxes and wage subsidies.
19

concerns about capital market constraints, where the desire is to break any linkages of poverty that exist
because parents cannot provide appropriate schooling opportunities to their children).
An alternative redistributive motive actually appears to guide much policy and to interact with a
range of policy initiatives discussed below.30 Because housing in the United States and in many other
places tends to lead to concentrations of poor people, minorities, and others who traditionally have not
faired as well in schools, schools tend also to reinforce these concentrations.31 To the extent that
concentrations of poverty have added effects on schooling over and above individual poverty per se, there is
an externality that interacts with any redistribution objectives, government may again have a clear role for
correcting a market failure.
Without pursuing the details of any mandate for public action, however, two conclusions are
important. First, while various market interventions are frequently employed to justify governmental
intervention into education, very little explicit research or consideration has been given to the exact nature
of these. For example, are the externalities related to the quality of schooling or just the minimal quantity?
Second, as underscored by Poterba (1996), even less attention has been given to the appropriate mechanism
for any governmental intervention. For example, if government wished to deal with capital market
imperfections, should it provide free or reduced priced schools, make loans to students, operate the schools
directly, or give grants to students to attend schools? A simple comparison is useful. The organization of
the educational sector has moved toward government financing and government provision, similar issues in
the health sector have led to very different institutional structures (at least in the United States). With few

30

These issues arise most significantly when talking about policies that affect peer groups (e.g.,
desegregation policies) and policies that affect the financing of schools across local educational districts or agencies.
31

Much of the past work on concentrations of poverty has involved crime, health, and welfare outcomes. As
discussed below, the analytical complications of this work are serious. As Brock and Durlauf (forthcoming), Manski
(1993b) and Moffitt (2001) point out, the empirical analysis of peer influences has been inhibited by both conceptual
and data problems – problems that raise serious questions about interpretation of many existing studies. These
critiques, in part precipitated by analyses of neighborhood poverty (e.g. Mayer and Jencks (1989), O'Regan and
Quigley (1999), Rosenbaum and Popkin (1991)), point to a number of potentially severe empirical problems that are
at least partially present in the recent set of randomized housing experiments aimed at understanding neighborhood
effects (e.g., Rosenbaum (1995); Katz, Kling, and Liebman (2001); Ludwig, Duncan, and Hirschfield (2001)).
20

exceptions, little policy attention is given to any underlying consideration of the scope and form of
governmental intervention.
The summary from considering the role of government is that the arguments for the currently large
intervention – one quite generally including both financing and provision of services – remains not well
analyzed. Thus, the remainder of this essay addresses a more limited issue: how well does government do
at what it is trying to do.

Efficiency of Production
Because of the heavy involvement of the public sector in the actual provision of schooling,
understanding the efficiency of production becomes an important issue. With competitive, private
provision, little attention is given to economic or technical efficiency. Barring obvious market
imperfections, there is general faith that market forces will push firms toward efficient use of resources.
Even with market imperfections, there is generally little attention given to issues of technical efficiency,
because firms are presumed to produce the highest possible levels of output given the chosen inputs–even if
the firms are producing at the wrong level or not using the economically best set of inputs. But, the
involvement of government in production, frequently in near-monopoly situations, alters the focus
considerably. The possibility of inefficient production becomes a much more serious concern.
The attention to performance and efficiency in education began chiefly with Equality of
Educational Opportunity (the “Coleman Report”), a U.S. government publication that appeared in 1966
(Coleman et al. (1966)). The specific focus of the Coleman Report, mandated by the Civil Rights Act of
1964, was the extent of racial discrimination in U.S. public schools. Two aspects led to the broad attention
given to it and contributed to the controversy that has followed. First, it took the position that the central
issue was not so much governmental inputs to schooling as it was student outcomes. Second, it is widely
interpreted to imply that “schools are not important.”32

32

The Coleman Report was heavily criticized on methodological grounds (Bowles and Levin (1968); Cain
21

Public programs are frequently measured by the magnitude of public spending on them or the array
of specific real resources (personnel of various types, capital in buildings or laboratories, etc.) going into a
program. An extension of this is that variations in spending or resources indicate varying amounts of public
involvement. The presumption behind employing spending measures is that funds are used effectively,
implying spending is a simple index of the outcomes. The presumption behind the use of real resource
measures is that the specific resources are important components indicating differences in quality, even if
input prices vary across schools. The Coleman Report, which was required to look at the extent of racial
discrimination in the public provision of schooling, needed a measure of the importance of various inputs to
the schooling process. This requirement led the researchers to turn to measuring student outcomes and to
relating various inputs directly to outcomes. This focus, which had not been applied very broadly in
education or in other areas of government-provided services, dramatically changed the basic form of
analysis.
Much discussion of schools tends to use the terms “quality” and “resources” interchangeably, but
this usage presumes efficient operations of schools. A central part of the analysis discussed here looks
directly at aspects of how effectively public schools use resources – and concludes that considerable
inefficiency in resource usage exists. At a minimum, school quality should not be simply measured by
expenditure patterns or by specific resources. More importantly, policy should logically reflect this reality.
The attention to the Coleman Report reflected the popular interpretation of the analysis that
“schools do not make a difference.” That interpretation, as discussed below, is incorrect, but the basic
evidence behind the statement suggests serious performance problems of government, because purchased
inputs to schools are not closely related to outcomes. Evaluation of the alternative interpretations,
nonetheless, requires more general treatment of the educational production process and the empirical results
that are available.

and Watts (1970); Hanushek and Kain (1972)). The most serious issue was the use of an analysis of variance
procedure that biased the findings against any school factors being important and toward family factors. As discussed
22

General structure
The framework of analysis of educational performance considers a general production function
such as:

(1)

Oit = f(Fi(t), Pi(t), Si(t), Ai) + υit

where Oit =performance of student i at time t, Fi(t)=family inputs cumulative to time t, Pi(t)=cumulative peer
inputs, Si(t)=cumulative school inputs, Ai =innate ability, and a stochastic term, υit.
This general structure has motivated an extensive series of empirical studies. The typical empirical
study collects information about student performance and about the various educational inputs and then
attempts to estimate the characteristics of the production function using econometric techniques.
Two aspects of this formulation are important to point out. First, a variety of influences outside of
schools enter into the production of achievement. Second, the production process for achievement is
cumulative, building on a series of inputs over time. Both of these are important in the specification and
interpretation of educational production functions.
The relevance of many factors outside schools highlights the necessity of going beyond simple
comparisons of student performance across schools. Most of the attention in analytical studies has focused
on the measurement of school attributes. This focus seems natural from a policy point of view. It also
reflects the common use of administrative data in estimating production functions, because administrative
data are frequently short of many measures of family background. Nonetheless, this lack of attention is
unfortunate. First, increasing attention has been given to potential policies related to families – such as
preschool and daycare programs, after school programs, parent education and the like. Second, because

below, this study also confused measurability of inputs with the importance of teachers and schools.
23

families frequently exert preferences on the schools that their children will attend, incomplete measurement
of external influences on performance raise intense issues of selection bias and preclude simple statements
about causal influences of schools. Such an observation of course does not seem very profound, but, as
discussed below, many empirical studies give little attention to nonschool influences in addressing the
impact of school factors. Moreover, public policy debates surprisingly frequently rely on simple accounting
of performance across schools. For example, much of the current movement toward increased school
accountability often relies on just aggregate student scores for a school.33 Just the level of student
performance is not a reliable indicator of the quality of schools students are attending.
The cumulative nature of achievement, where the learning in any time period builds on prior
learning, implies that any analysis must take into account the time path of inputs. This places heavy
demands on measurement and data collection, because historical information is frequently difficult to
obtain.
The cumulative nature of the production process has been a prime motivation for considering a
value-added formulation. At least in a linear version of (1), it is possible to look at the growth in
contemporaneous performance over some period of time, instead of the level of performance, and relate that
to the flow of specific inputs. The general value-added formulation can be written as:

(2)

Oit - Oit*= f*(Fi(t-t*), Pi(t-t*), Si(t-t*)) + υit - υit*

33

With the increasing popularity of publishing average performance of students in different schools, the
interpretation of scores becomes more important. In fact, without consideration of the various inputs that go beyond
just schools, alternative accountability systems can have perverse effects (cf. Hanushek and Raymond (2001)). The
integration of the underlying theoretical and empirical analysis of the determination of achievement with
accountability and incentive systems is an important but underdeveloped area of investigation.
24

where outcome changes over the period (t-t*) are related to inputs over the same period. Note that this
formulation dramatically lessens the data requirements and eliminates anything that appears as a fixed effect
in the level of achievement (eq. 1).34
A final key issue is how student performance is measured. A prime justification for the attention to
education, as described previously, is its hypothesized effects on labor market outcomes. The question
remains about how best to measure educational output for understanding production relationships and
policy options. With few exceptions (e.g., Betts (1995), Grogger (1996)), accurate measures of school
inputs have not been related to subsequent earnings, making direct analysis impossible.35 Thus, most
analyses have conceptualized this as a two-stage problem: school resources and other things are related to
test scores, school completion, or other intermediate outcomes, and these outcomes are related to subsequent
success.36

Effects of teacher and schools
The most obvious complication of estimating models such as equation 1 is the necessity to specify
precisely the various inputs into the production of student achievement. A logical starting place is
estimation of the magnitude of differences across teachers and schools.
Consider

34

This formulation presumes that innate abilities are constant and thus fall out of achievement growth. With
more information on variations over time, it is also possible to allow for ability differences in growth (Rivkin,
Hanushek, and Kain (2001)). Alternative formulations have prior achievement, Oit*, on the right hand side, allowing
for coefficient different than one (Hanushek (1979)). This latter approach has the advantages of allowing for different
scales of measurement in achievement during different years and introducing the possibility that growth in
performance differs by starting point. It has the disadvantages of introducing measurement error on the right hand
side and of complicating the error structure, particularly in models relying on more than a single year of an
individual’s achievement growth.
35

Another class of studies, those aggregated to high levels such as the state level, have also considered labor
market outcomes (e.g., Akin and Garfinkel (1977), Card and Krueger (1992a)). These studies, which introduce a
wider set of analytical concerns, are discussed below.
36

In more pragmatic terms, if interested in understanding policy influences on student outcomes, one would
not want to wait decades until the ultimate impact in the labor market is observed.
25

(3)

Oit - Oit*= f*(Fi(t-t*), Pi(t-t*)) + ∑ tj Tij + (υit - υit* )

where Tij is an indicator variable if student has teacher j during the period t-t*. This general covariance, or
fixed-effect, formulation identifies teacher and school effects by systematic differences in achievement
gains by students. In this formulation, teacher quality is measured implicitly by the average gain in
achievement for the students of each teacher (adjusted for other factors influencing achievement).
Such analyses consistently show large and significant differences among teachers (e.g., Hanushek
(1971, 1992); Murnane (1975); Murnane and Phillips (1981); Armor et al. (1976); Rivkin, Hanushek, and
Kain (2001)). In the general formulation of equation 3, however, identification and interpretation of teacher
and school effects is nonetheless complicated, since any factors that are constant across the period t-t* and
across the students with teacher j are incorporated in the estimated effect, tj. Thus, for example, teacher
effects, school effects and classroom peer effects are not separately identified if the estimates come from a
single cross section of teachers. Hanushek (1992), however, demonstrates the consistency of teacher effects
across grades and school years, thus indicating that the estimated differences relate directly to teacher
quality and not the specific mix of students and the interaction of teacher and students. Rivkin, Hanushek,
and Kain (2001) remove separate school and grade fixed effects and observe the consistency of teacher
effects across different cohorts – thus isolating the impact of teachers as opposed to just some combined
teacher and classroom effects.37
The magnitude of differences in teacher quality is noteworthy. The estimated difference between a
"good" and a "bad" teacher in poverty schools of Gary, Indiana, was approximately one grade level per

37

The approach in Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2001), however, relies on just variations within schools
(having removed any fixed school and grade effects on achievement). Therefore, it cannot identify either the
magnitude of between school differences in teacher quality or the importance of overall school differences such as
that reflecting school leadership, quality of facilities, or the like. Even though for many purposes understanding the
magnitude of between school quality differences is also important, an important objective of this paper is eliminating
any possibility of selection effects.
26

academic year; i.e., a student with a good teacher might progress at 1.5 grade equivalents in a school year,
while those with a bad teacher might progress at 0.5 grade equivalents (Hanushek (1992)). Alternatively,
Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2001) produce lower bounds on estimates of the variance in teacher quality
entirely from heterogeneity of teachers within Texas schools. The estimates indicate that one standard
deviation in teacher quality is equal to one-fifth of the average gap in performance between low income and
higher income students. In other words, contrary to some conclusions emanating from Coleman et al.
(1966), schools have the ability to compensate for educational differences arising from family backgrounds.
A string of five above average teachers can, by the previous estimates, entirely close the average
achievement gap by income level within Texas schools.
The identification of teacher and school effects also relies on the linearity of effects. If teachers, for
example, have different effects on certain subgroups of students, the estimates of equation (3) do not
separate out pure teacher effects. This problem, which also exists for estimation that relies upon specific
measures of teacher characteristics, can be investigated through straightforward extensions of the model to
allow tj to vary across groups or according to other characteristics.
While estimation of this general fixed effect model demonstrates the significant impact of variations
in teacher and school quality, it does not pinpoint the underlying characteristics or causes of these
differences. Estimation by Murnane (1975) and by Armor et al. (1976) demonstrates that school principals
are able to identify variations in teacher quality in the value-added sense of tj. Thus, evidence suggests that
quality variations are observable – an important issue in light of the next section that demonstrates that
quality is not captured by measures of common characteristics such as degrees and experience of teachers.

Components of school inputs
The vast majority of analyses of educational production have pursued a different approach: the
specification and estimation of hypothesized components of the teacher and school effects. This work
returns to the specifications in equations 1 or 2 and attempts to incorporate specific measures of the
27

components of Sit, the relevant inputs from the school. High on the list of characteristics has been a variety
of measures of the resources going into schools, since budgeting for added expenditures of various sorts
presents a series of obvious hypotheses about which factors influence achievement. This approach has not
been very productive from the viewpoint of empirical description of the educational progress. But that in
itself is significant because, as discussed below, these measured inputs are frequently the object of
governmental decision making and policy.
Studies of educational performance include a variety of different measures of resources devoted to
schools. Commonly employed measures include (1) the real resources of the classroom (teacher education,
teacher experience, and class size or teacher-pupil ratios); 2) financial aggregates of resources (expenditure
per student and teacher salary); and, 3) measures of other resources in schools (specific teacher
characteristics, administrative inputs, and facilities).
The real resource category receives the bulk of analytical attention. First, these best summarize
variations in resources at the classroom level. Teacher education and teacher experience are the primary
determinants of teacher salaries. When combined with teachers per pupil, these variables describe the most
significant variations in the instructional resources across classrooms. Second, these measures are readily
available and well-measured.38 Third, they relate to the largest changes in schools over the past three
decades. Table 5 displays the dramatic increases in these school inputs for the U.S., with pupil-teacher
ratios falling steadily, teacher experience increasing, and the percent of teachers with a masters' degree
actually doubling between 1960 and 1990. Similar increases in resources have been well documented in
other countries around the world (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2001)).
Fourth, studies of growth in performance at the classroom level like equation 2, commonly thought to be the
superior analytical design, frequently have these resource measures available but not the others.

38

A majority of existing analyses of student performance has relied upon administrative data from schools.
The real resource variables are commonly collected and reported within such data, and, because they are frequently
the basis of payments or regulations across levels of government, they tend to be reported accurately.
28

The analytical design of studies of real resources stands in contrast with that for the other resource
measures. The financial aggregates, particularly expenditure per pupil, are typically not even calculated for
the classroom or the school, but instead are only available for the school district or for entire states or
nations. As a result, studies employing these are typically the most aggregated studies, a source of
analytical problems discussed below. Moreover, studies focusing on spending are not amenable to valueadded specifications, causing the set of specification problems described previously. The study of spending
is directly relevant for many policy discussions,39 but these expenditure studies are noticeably lower quality
than the best, and the typical, study investigating real classroom resources. The measures of other school
resources typically are measured poorly and tend to be available only at the district level.40 Since resources
such as facilities tend to be relatively smaller in terms of overall spending, one would also expect these
factors to be less important in determining student achievement.

Results of Production Function Estimation for the United States
Existing estimation of educational production functions provides considerable information about
governmentally provided schooling. The intellectual heritage of this is the Coleman Report (Coleman et al.
(1966)). This governmentally sponsored study spawned a large body of subsequent analyses, in large part
because of its conclusions that cast doubts on the productivity on public schools. Perhaps more important,
it set a standard of studying outcomes of schooling. Because of the common approach to studies conducted

39

Some studies include expenditure per pupil along with measures of the real classroom resources. In such a
case, since variations in classroom instructional expenditure are held constant, expenditure per student is interpreted
as spending outside of the classroom. If only some of the classroom resources are included, the interpretation is more
ambiguous and depends on the specific specification.
40

For example, policy deliberations often consider the relative proportion of resources going to
administration versus instruction. In the United States, the proportion of expenditures at the classroom level has
fallen dramatically over time (Hanushek and Rivkin (1997)), leading some to view this as a measure of waste.
However, without accounting for the uses of these resources and their effects on achievement, it is difficult to make
such efficiency statements. Unfortunately, little work has concentrated on expenditures outside of the classroom.
Data are imprecise, because even the definition of what are administrative expenditures is not settled. When
available, administrative and other expenditure categories are generally not disaggregated at the school level.
Similarly, measures of resources like laboratories or libraries are noted by their existence as opposed to any idea
29

since the Coleman Report, it is possible to provide a consistent summary of the results of how resources and
other inputs affect student performance.
Providing a consistent summary is especially important in this area, because the large number of
existing studies, taken individually, appear to support a number of disparate conclusions which do not hold
when put in the context of the entire body of evidence. A tendency to focus selectively on a few studies and
findings is exacerbated by the relationship between the research and serious policy discussions. The results
of this research has been entered into legislative debates, judicial proceedings, and executive proposals –
frequently placing heavy weight on the subset of studies that supports a particular position.
This discussion begins with tabulation of all studies meeting rudimentary quality standards
(published in a refereed journal or book, including some measure of family background, and presenting
information about the statistical properties of estimates). By including the universe of U.S. studies
(available through 1994), the initial analysis provides an overview that is not affected by selectivity of
results.
Estimates of key production function parameters come from 376 separate published estimates,
found in 89 separate articles or books.41 The estimated relationships vary in a variety of substantive ways
(by measure of student performance, by grade, by included measures of resources). These studies also vary
widely in quality, as generally captured by methodology and adequacy of data. Subsequent discussion
considers how any results might be affected by key dimensions of focus and quality. In particular, the
following sections delve into both analytical issues (methodology and data) and substantive specification
issues (behavior and organization).

extent or quality.
41

A more complete description of the studies can be found in Hanushek (1997a), which updates the analysis
in Hanushek (1986). The tabulations here correct some of the original coding of effects in that publication. They also
omit the estimates from Card and Krueger (1992b). In reviewing all of the studies and estimates, it was discovered
that these estimates were based on models that did not include any measures of family background differences. This
specification requirement is a minimal quality criterion, since omission will almost certainly lead to biased resource
estimates. Family backgrounds have been shown to be quite generally correlated with school resources and have been
shown to have strong effects on student outcomes.
30

Basic Results
Table 6 presents the overall summary of results of estimates of the effects of key resources for U.S.
public schools. The tabulations note the numbers of separate estimates for each parameter along with their
estimated direction of effect and with their statistical significance (5 percent level).
In terms of real classroom resources, only 9 percent of the estimates for the level of teachers
education and 14 percent of the estimates for teacher-pupil ratios show positive and statistically significant
effects on student performance.42 These relatively small numbers of statistically significant positive results
are balanced by another set finding statistically significant negative results—reaching 14 percent in the case
of teacher-pupil ratios or the same percentage as finding the expected positive effect. Most estimates (72
percent of the teacher-pupil ratio estimates and 86 percent of the teacher education estimates) are
statistically insignificant and those reporting the sign of insignificant estimated coefficients are split fairly
evenly between positive and negative. A higher proportion of estimated effects of teacher experience are
positive and statistically significant: 29 percent. Importantly, however, 71 percent still indicate worsening
performance with experience or less confidence in any positive effect. And, because more experienced
teachers can frequently choose their school and/or students, a portion of the positive effects could actually
reflect reverse causation (Greenberg and McCall (1974); Murnane (1981); Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin
(2001c)). In sum, the vast number of estimated real resource effects gives little confidence that just adding
more of any of the specific resources to schools will lead to a boost in student achievement. Moreover, this
statement does not even get into whether or not any effects are ‘large’. Given the small confidence in just

42

The individual studies tend to measure each of these inputs in different ways. For example, while many
studies include an indicator variable for whether or not the teacher has a master’s degree, some will include measures
of the graduate credits. With teacher-pupil ratio, some measure actual class size, while the majority measure teacherpupil ratio. A variety of functional forms have been used, ranging from simple linear relationships to different
nonlinear forms with thresholds, quadratics, and the like. In all cases, estimated signs are reversed if the measure
involves pupil-teacher ratios or class size instead of teacher-pupil ratio. Further, where nonlinearities indicate positive
effects over some range but not others, say with ranges of teacher experience, the most favorable for the hypothesis of
positive effects is recorded.
31

getting noticeable improvements, it seems somewhat unimportant to investigate the size of any estimated
effects, at least for the aggregation of studies.
The financial aggregates provide a similar picture. There is very weak support for the notion that
simply providing higher teacher salaries or greater overall spending will lead to improved student
performance. Per pupil expenditure has received the most attention, but only 27 percent of the estimated
coefficients are positive and statistically significant. In fact, seven percent even suggestion some confidence
in the fact that adding resources would harm student achievement. In reality, as discussed below, studies
involving per pupil expenditure tend to be the lowest quality studies, and there is substantial reason to
believe that even these results overstate the true effect of added expenditure.
Outside of the basic resource factors, a vast number of specific measures of teachers and schools
have been included at one time or another, but few measures have been repeated frequently enough to
permit any sort of tabulation. One set of exceptions involves either administrative inputs or facilities.
While these categories include a wide range of specific measures, the results of such investigation as
tabulated in Table 6 show little consistent effect on student performance.43 An additional exception is
teacher test score, where teachers have been given some sort of achievement or IQ test and their score on
that has been related to their students' performance. Table 6 displays the results of the 41 studies that
include teacher test scores. Of all of the explicit measures that lend themselves to tabulation, stronger
teacher test scores are most consistently related to higher student achievement, even though only 37 percent
provide positive and statistically significant effects.

Components of results
The forgoing tabulations combine the available evidence in a variety of ways – across grade levels,

43

Administrative inputs are measured with such things as overall spending, the salaries of administrators, or
the qualifications of administrators. Facilities include expenditures and specific measures such as availability of
laboratories, the size and presence of a library, and the property of the school. In all cases, results are tabulated such
that more of the measured characteristic means greater resources.
32

across measures of outcomes, and across studies of varying quality. While study quality is considered in the
next section, the other issues do not have a strong influence on the overall findings. Real resources tend to
show the same inconsistent pattern with achievement at both elementary and secondary school levels (not
shown). Similarly the results of real or financial resources are not very different for studies focusing on test
scores as the measure of performance and those focusing on other outcome measures. One specific issue has
received extra attention. Do high resource schools encourage students to stay in school longer (which has
obvious impacts on earnings)? Answering this question is, perhaps, more difficult than the straight
achievement question, because labor market opportunities will affect the school completion decision as will
net tuition and parental financial support when contemplating college. That question is a focal point of
Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996). In that study of school completion, school resources have no
significant impact on student behavior once individual achievement and school costs are considered.44 The
issue of performance measurement has arisen specifically within the context of results for achievement tests
and results for labor market outcomes (see controversies, below). Nonetheless, except for the differences in
aggregation of the underlying estimation, no significant differences in results are found.

The role of peers
Schools are made up of teachers and other personnel but also include other students – peers. In
fact, early sociological discussion of schools emphasized peers, and the Coleman Report (Coleman et al.
(1966)) is commonly interpreted as arguing that peers played a more significant role in student achievement
than did the resources and other formal structure of the schools. The interest in peers and integration of this

44

Resource effects on college continuation are emphasized in Card and Krueger (1996). The estimation of
resource impacts on school continuation is, however, particularly prone to specification problems. One might expect
state effects to be particularly important in determining school continuation, since the availability and expense of
public colleges and universities and the opportunity costs implied by different local labor markets vary significantly
across states. The studies of college attendance in general do not control for interstate differences, leading to serious
specification errors. (State policies and their impacts on production function estimates are discussed below). Betts
(1996) reviews a number of these studies of educational attainment and does suggest some positive effects of
resources. For the studies tabulated here (which differ from those considered by Betts), there tend to be positive
effects of expenditure on school attainment, but there are only 25 total studies and only five estimated from within
individual states. Thus, the small samples make it difficult to resolve this issue conclusively.
33

with Tiebout choices of families are set out in an interesting set of papers emphasizing the general
equilibrium outcomes including de Bartolome (1990), Manski (1992), Benabou (1993, 1996), Epple and
Romano (1998, forthcoming), Nechyba (2000, forthcoming-b), and Caucutt (forthcoming). A central
element running through these papers is how financing mechanisms, particularly vouchers, interact with
demands of families for different peers. While the structure of the vouchers and the mechanisms for
individual behavior affect the solutions, these papers suggest that important peer influences can have direct
ramifications for overall welfare and for the distribution of outcomes. These papers consider the outcomes
of sorting, assuming that peer groups are important. Unfortunately, the development of empirical work has
not kept pace with the theoretical investigations.
The empirical analysis of peers is very difficult to conduct and the results have been hard to
interpret because they become confused with issues of the underlying estimation. Manski (1993b, 2000),
Moffitt (2001), and Brock and Durlauf (forthcoming) describe a variety of econometric issues surrounding
the topic.
Perhaps the most significant issue in estimating peer effects is the presence of omitted or
mismeasured variables for schools and peers. Mismeasured individual factors or neglected influences that
are common to the peers lead naturally to further identification issues, because mismeasured individual
factors may be proxied by aggregate measures for the peers. Importantly, omitted variables bias will under
very general circumstances lead to overstating peer influences, so peer effects can appear significant even in
the case where they have no true effect Hanushek et al. (forthcoming). As the previous analysis of measured
school factors indicates, characterizing school quality has been difficult, and thus it is highly likely that
standard estimation of educational production functions with peers will overstate peer influences.
The theoretical econometric literature has concentrated more on the endogeneity of peer influences.
Peer effects can be thought of as a simultaneous equation system where each student affects the others in
the class and is in turn affected by the others, implying that standard issues of identification arise. These

34

issues are very difficult to deal with, particularly if the main effect of peers is through contemporaneous
interactions. Specifically, if my behavior affects peer behavior and peer behavior affects me, estimation is
problematic. Normal exclusion conditions, or even random assignment of students to classrooms, offer little
hope in this case. If instead it is the characteristics of peers, such as how prepared they are for the
curriculum or their general motivation and outlook, the development of both econometric estimators and the
use of sample randomization becomes more feasible. In this case, nonetheless, the pure measurement issues
still impinge on the ability to separate individual effects from peer effects.
Early empirical investigations provide mixed results about the importance of peers (Hanushek
(1972, 1992)), Henderson, Mieszkowski, and Sauvageau (1976), and Summers and Wolfe (1977)). More
recent analysis has taken alternative approaches to identification of peer effects. Hanushek et al.
(forthcoming) consider changes in the peer composition that arise from small changes across grades and
cohorts in demographics and prior achievement. They are able to eliminate any time invariant effects of
schools and grades in schools through a fixed effect strategy and then to identify the effects of peers. They
find small but significant differences of having smarter peers, and they find some effects of racial
composition.
A separate strand of research, which has generally not been too careful about the structure of peer
estimation, has looked at questions of ability tracking, or streaming, in schools. Conventional wisdom has
suggested that heterogeneous grouping is good because the higher achievers help the lower achievers but
are not affected by having low achieving classmates (Oakes (1985, 1992)). A careful review of this
literature along with new estimation of tracking effects is found in Argys, Rees, and Brewer (1996).
Nonetheless, this important policy issue deserves more attention, particularly in terms of the underlying
methodological difficulties.
Peer effects have been considered in an international context by Zimmer and Toma (2000). Their
analysis, using data from the second international mathematics and science tests given in 1981, estimated

35

achievement models across five countries (Belgium, France, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States)
and incorporating public and private schools. They find that peer ability appears important, especially for
low achieving students, and that peer effects may be more important in public than in private schools.
Because peer effects enter into a wide variety of other economic analyses and because they are the
subject of intense policy deliberation, it remains surprising that there has not been more empirical research
into the topic.

Racial integration
Racial integration of schools has been one of the most significant factors in United States public
schools over the past fifty years. Yet, while there has been an enormous amount of legislative and judicial
attention to racial desegregation of schools, the analysis of its effects is quite limited.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) held that separate but equal
was unconstitutional because separate could not be equal.45 This ruling led to dramatic changes in schools
throughout the country. While school integration started slowly, the decade of the 1970s witnessed a
substantial reduction in segregation brought about largely through legal pressure on local school districts
(Welch and Light (1987)).
Many of the early (post-Brown) analyses, which focused on short run effects of purposefully
moving students to less segregated schools, consider a variety of student outcomes and yield mixed effects
of desegregation (Crain and Mahard (1978), Cook (1984), Armor (1995)). These studies are, however,
plagued by methodological problems – largely related to sample selection issues but also including the
heterogeneity of desegregation circumstances – making it difficult to assess the general impact of
desegregation efforts.
Another segment of this literature focused on not so much on student outcomes but on the impact of
desegregation efforts on the subsequent racial composition of schools. The large-scale exodus of whites

45

Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).
36

from many cities and towns clearly dampened the impact of school desegregation on interracial contact, and
beginning with analysis of “white flight” in the face of court ordered desegregation by Coleman, Kelley,
and Moore (1975), much of the analytical focus shifted to outcomes defined in terms of racial contact
(Welch and Light (1987), Clotfelter (2001)).46
Finally, a related but distinct strand of research focuses on whether peer racial composition, as
opposed to desegregation actions, affects achievement for blacks as well as for other demographic groups.
Coleman et al. (1966)) and its offshoots (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1967)) provided empirical
evidence that racial isolation harms academic achievement.47 Subsequent work by Crain (1970), Boozer,
Krueger, and Wolkon (1992), Grogger (1996), and Hoxby (2000c) finds that school racial composition
affected academic, social, or economic outcomes. Hanushek (1972) finds that higher concentrations of
blacks hurts both whites and blacks, but is concerned that the racial composition of the school may simply
be a proxy for heterogeneity in school quality and other omitted factors. Rivkin (2000) finds no evidence
that exposure to whites increases academic attainment or earnings for Black men or women in the high
school class of 1982, and Cook and Evans (2000) indicate that little of the black-white difference in
National Assessment of Educational Progress scores can be attributed to racial concentration. On the other
hand, Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001b) find that the racial composition of the school has a significant
effect on black students, but not whites or Hispanics. Moreover, the negative effect of being in a school
with higher concentrations of blacks is highly concentrated on blacks in the upper ability groups. The use
of stacked panel data that permits controlling for other inputs in a very general manner suggests that
unmeasured school quality can be ruled out as the primary cause of these findings and that specialized peer

46

A related line of inquiry investigates racial composition and private schools (e.g., Clotfelter (1976) or
Fairlie and Resch (forthcoming)). Whether or not private schools tend to be more segregated than public schools has
also been the subject of considerable policy debate since Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore (1982). These issues are,
however, beyond the scope of this analysis.
47

The Coleman Report data, collected in 1965, largely reflect the legal and behavioral equilibrium before
court ordered desegregation efforts, because most desegregation plans were instituted in subsequent periods (Welch
and Light (1987)).
37

effects are the most likely explanation.
Most existing estimates have not paid close attention to the methodological issues surrounding
identification of peer effects.48 Moreover, the research has often failed to even separate out the most
rudimentary differences in school quality.49 Further research into aspects of the racial composition of
schools, similar to peer research, appears to be a challenging but high value line of inquiry.

Family inputs
The emphasis of the original Coleman Report on the role of families in education has generated
little subsequent disagreement. Most empirical studies of school performance include some measure of
family background.50 In fact, having some controls for family differences was a requirement for the
previous tabulation of resource results, because ignoring these differences will undoubtedly bias resource
coefficients through the correlation of family background and resources. Nonetheless, this research for the
most part has not considered the details of what aspects of families are most important or of the causal
structure of family effects.
The general argument has been that changing the important underlying characteristics of the family
would be extraordinarily expensive even if policy makers wished to consider such an approach. Thus, for
example, if mother’s education were known to be important in a child’s achievement, the best short run
policy probably is not to send all mothers back to school. For this reason, researchers have not paid close
attention to the precise measurement and specification of family effects.
On the other hand, long run policies may nonetheless reasonably relate to family factors. For

48

A recent comprehensive review finds the evidence on achievement and psychological differences is very
mixed Schofield (1995) and attributes the inconclusiveness largely to methodological shortcomings.
49

See for example the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1967), which neglects any consideration of school
factors Hanushek (1972). Of course, an alternative argument for policy purposes might be that only the reduced form
relationship is needed, because the correlates of racial composition may adjust with desegregation. Moreover, much
of the discussion about school segregation goes far beyond the simple discussions of student achievement.
50

One large exception to this rule is that many studies of labor market effects or other performance measures
that are collected after completion of schooling often neglect background information. See the review and discussion
38

example, arguments for improving women’s education in developing countries may reflect the potential
impacts on children’s achievement more than the normal arguments about the return to the mother of human
capital investment, particularly in countries where women do not work much in the formal market.51
But, if long run policies are directed at family factors, it is important to know the exact nature and
causal impact of families. Is it the education of mothers that is important? Or is it the education of fathers
(which often is not given the same analytical attention)? Or is it some other aspect of the family – wealth,
attitudes, expectations, or other things – that is truly important and that shows up through its correlation
with parental education?
The little work that has been explicitly related to family factors has opened serious question about
the underlying causal structure. For example, Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) suggest that mother’s
education may not be as important in children’s schooling as commonly believed, once proper attention is
paid to the possibility of omitted factors.52 Similarly, Mayer (1997) questions whether income per se affects
the kinds of family outcomes that are normally subsumed under the topic of poverty and income. Part of the
issue in understanding families effects may arise from heterogeneous incentives within and across families
(cf., Becker and Tomes (1976), Weinberg (2001)).
As policy debates venture into policies that are designed to change families, it is important to
understand better the underlying structure. For example, as described previously, a variety of policies for
developing countries point to family factors. But, in developed countries similar policy initiatives such as
those designed to strength the family role or to ameliorate adverse family influences are increasingly
discussed. The general problem has been that existing studies lack a convincing identification strategy that

in Betts (1996).
51

These arguments also interrelate with a variety of economic models of fertility that consider trade-offs
between child quantity and quality, although most do not directly consider child achievement; see Becker and Lewis
(1973), Willis (1973), Hanushek (1992)).
52

Their analysis relies on a sample of identical twins to separate the effects of mothers from other possible
influences. While their cross-sectional estimates reproduce the common positive effects of mother’s education, their
refinements alter the sign.

distinguishes true structural aspects of families from a variety of correlated proxies.

The importance of study quality

The conclusions that should be drawn from the prior tabulations of results have been questioned
because no weighting is used to distinguish among the quality of the studies. While the previous discussion
presents the universe of available evidence, the studies of educational performance clearly differ in quality
and the potential for yielding biased results.
Two elements of quality, both related to model specification and estimation, are particularly
important.53 First, education policy in the United States is made by the 50 separate states, and the variations
in spending, regulations, graduation requirements, testing, labor laws, and teacher certification and hiring
policies are large. These potentially important differences – which are also the locus of most policy debates
in the states – imply that any studies of student performance across states must include descriptions of the
policy environment of schools or else they will be subject to standard omitted variables bias. The
misspecification of models that ignore variations in state education policy (and other potential state
differences) interacts with the estimation approach. As Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996) demonstrate,
any bias in the estimated parameters will be exacerbated by aggregation of the estimation sample.54
Nonetheless, the direction of any bias is an empirical issue, because it depends on the correlation of the

53

Krueger (2000) introduces a different measure of study quality. His proposed measure is the number of
separate parameter estimates in a given published analysis. So, for example, a publication that included estimates
from a production function for eighth grade reading and one for high school graduation would necessarily be lower
quality than a publication that only reported on third grade mathematics. Because this criterion is not related to
conventional statistical arguments about model misspecification, estimation bias, or the quality of the underlying data
base, it is not pursued here.
54

Loeb and Page (2000) argue that in some circumstances, such as their analysis of compensating
differentials in teacher wages, state aggregate data will be superior because it averages over choices across districts
within states. To deal with state policy variations they concentrate on within state differences with a state specific
time trend employing a panel of salaries and school attainment.
40

omitted state regulatory and finance factors and the included school measures such as class size or spending.

Second, as noted, education is a cumulative process, but a majority of studies are purely crosssectional with only contemporaneous measures of inputs. In other words, when looking at performance at
the end of secondary schooling, many studies measure just the current teachers and school resources and
ignore the dozen or more prior years of inputs. Obviously, current school inputs will tend to be a very
imperfect measure of the resources that went into producing ending achievement. This mismeasurement is
strongest for any children who changed schools over their career (a sizable majority in the U.S.) but,
because of the heterogeneity of teachers within schools, also holds for students who do not move (see
Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a)). Even if contemporaneous measures were reasonable proxies for the
stream of cumulative inputs, uncertainty about the interpretation and policy implications would remain. The
coefficients would bear an ambiguous relationship to the underlying structure parameters of interest, making
policy calculations difficult. But there is little reason to believe that they are good proxies.
While judgments about study quality have a subjective element, it is possible to make a crude cut
based on violations of these two central problems. Table 7 provides insight into the pattern and importance
of the specific omitted variables bias resulting from lack of information about key educational policy
differences across states. This table considers two input measures: teacher-pupil ratio and expenditure per
pupil. These inputs, on top of being important for policy, are included in a sufficient number of analyses at
various levels of aggregation that they can provide direct information of potential misspecification biases.
As discussed previously, the percentage of all estimates of the impact of teacher pupil ratios with significant
positive estimates is evenly balanced by those with significant negative estimates. But this is not true for
estimates relying upon samples drawn entirely within a single state, where the overall policy environment is
constant and thus where any bias from omitting overall state policies is eliminated. For single state studies,
the statistically significant effects are disproportionately negative. Yet, as the samples are drawn across

41

states, the relative proportion positive and statistically significant rises. For those aggregated to the state
level, almost two-thirds of the estimates are positive and statistically significant. The pattern of results also
holds for estimates of the effects of expenditure differences, which are more likely to come from highly
aggregate studies involving multiple states. (Expenditure studies virtually never direct analysis at
performance across different classrooms or schools, since expenditure data are typically available only at the
district level. Thus, they begin at a more aggregated level than many studies of real resources.)
This pattern of results is consistent with expectations from considering specification biases when
favorable, but omitted, state policies tend to be positively correlated with resource usage. As noted, while
the direction of any bias depends on the degree of correlation, under quite general circumstances, any bias
will tend to be more severe if estimation is conducted at the state level than if conducted at the classroom
level (Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996)).55 The initial assessment of effects from Table 6 indicated
little reason to be confident about overall resource policies. The refinement on quality in Table 7 indicates
that a number of the significant effects may primarily be artifacts of the sampling and methodology.
The second problem is a different variant of model specification. Because education is a
cumulative process, relating the level of performance at any point in time just to the current resources is
likely to be misleading. The standard approach for dealing with this is the estimation of value-added
models such as equation 2 where attention is restricted to the growth of achievement over a limited period
of time (when the flow of resources is also observed).
Table 8 displays the results of studies that consider value-added models for individual students.
The top panel shows all such results, while the bottom panel follows the earlier approach of concentrating
just on studies within a state. With the most refined investigation of quality, the number of studies gets
quite small and selective. In these, however, there is no support for systematic improvements through

The discussion of aggregation is part of a broader debate trying to reconcile the findings of Card and
Krueger (1992a) with those presented here. See discussion below.
42

increasing teacher-pupil ratios and hiring teachers with more graduate education.56 The effects of teacher
experience are largely unaffected from those for the universe of studies. Again, because of the small and
selective nature of these value-added studies within a single state, uncertainty about the precise effect of
ignoring history remains. They do, however, make a prima facie case that the prior results about the effects
of specific resources were not simply an artifact of study quality.

International Evidence

Analysis of how schools affect student performance has been conducted considerably more in the
United States than in other countries. Nonetheless, similar investigations have been conducted in other
parts of the world, even though data limitations have tended to be more severe.
The evidence for countries other than the United States is potentially important for a variety of
reasons. Other countries have varying institutional structures, so different findings could help to identify
the importance of organization and overall incentives. Moreover, other countries frequently have much
different levels and exhibit larger variance in resource usage, offering the prospect of understanding better
the importance of pure resource differences. For example, one explanation of the lack of relationship
between resources and performance in the United States is its schools may be generally operating in an area
of severe diminishing marginal productivity where marginal resource effects are small. By observing
schools at very different levels of resources, however, it would be possible to distinguish between
technological aspects of the production relationship and other possible interpretations of the evidence such
as imprecise incentives for students and teachers.
Analysis in less developed countries has shown a similar inconsistency of estimated resource effects

Other possible explanations of the results also exist. For example, as discussed in more detail below,
Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2001) are able to find statistically significant but small effects of class size differences,
and these effects differ by socioeconomic status of the family. This analysis, based on very large samples, suggests
the possibility that other analyses lack sufficient statistical power to detect the small and varying effects of some of the
school factors.

across studies. While these estimates typically come from special purpose analyses and are frequently not
published in refereed journals, they do provide insights into resource use at very different levels of support.
Table 9 provides evidence on resource effects from studies completed by 1990.57 Two facets of these data
compared to the previous United States data stand out: 1. In general, a minority of the available studies
suggests much confidence that the identified resources systematically and positively influence student
performance; and, 2. There is generally somewhat stronger support for these resource policies than that
existing in U.S. studies. Thus, the data hint that the importance of resources may vary with the level of
resources, a natural presumption. Nonetheless, the evidence still does not suggest that pure resource
policies can be expected to have a significant effect on student outcomes.
There is similar evidence to that in the U.S. that very significant differences exist among teachers
(Harbison and Hanushek (1992)). Their analysis in the very poor region of northeast Brazil finds very large
differences in total teacher effects. Surprisingly these differences are not related to simple measures such as
the amount of teacher education or experience, even though, for example, teacher education can be as little
as four years.
The evidence on developed countries outside of the United States is more difficult to compile. The
review by Vignoles et al. (2000) points to a small number of studies outside of the U.S. and shows some
variation in them similar to that already reported among estimates elsewhere.
A set of consistent estimates for recent periods using the data from the Third International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is presented in Hanushek and Luque (forthcoming). They employ
the data on variations in scores within countries. The 36 countries with complete data are weighted toward
more developed countries but do include poor countries. They find little evidence that any of the standard
resource measures for schools are related to differences in mathematics and science scores within

and Hanushek (1992), and a variety of studies during the 1980s.
44

countries.58 Moreover, there is no evidence in this consistent work that there are different effects of
resources by income level of the country or by level of the resources. Thus, contrary to the conclusions of
Heyneman and Loxley (1983), schools do not appear relatively more important for poorer countries.
Woessman (2000, 2001) looks at cross national differences in TIMSS math and science scores and
concludes that the institutional structure matters importantly for achievement. By pooling the student test
scores across countries and estimating models that include both school and national characteristics, he finds
suggestive evidence that the amount of competition from private schools and the amount of decentralization
of decision making to schools have significant beneficial impacts, while union strength is detrimental and
standard differences in resources across countries are not clearly related to student performance. The
limited number of national observations for institutions nevertheless leaves some uncertainty about the
estimates and calls for replication in other samples that permit, say, variations within countries in the key
institutional features.
While the international evidence has been more limited, this situation is likely to be reversed
profitably in the future. A key problem historically has been less available performance data for different
countries, but this lack of information is being corrected. As student outcome data become more plentiful –
allowing investigation of value added by teachers in schools in different environments, international
evidence can be expected to grow in importance.

Interpretation of Evidence on School Performance
The previous work on educational production has provided substantial evidence that there are vast
differences among teachers and schools. At the same time, these differences are not easily described by the
resources employed or by any simple set of programmatic or behavioral descriptions. More importantly,
since policy is often directed at the resource levels, questions about the effectiveness of the public provision
of schooling naturally arise.
The evidence does not say that money and resources never matter. Nor does it say that money and
resources could not matter. It simply describes the central patterns of results given the current organization
and incentives in schools. Indeed, a plausible interpretation of the evidence is that some schools in fact use
resources effectively but that these schools are counterbalanced by others that do not. At the same time, the
expansion of resource usage unaccompanied by performance gains implies a high level of inefficiency in the
current operations of schools.
The implications of these results, however, depends fundamentally on how the policy and decision
making process is conceived. At one level, these conclusions clearly imply that educational policy making
is more difficult than many would like. If resources had a consistent and predictable effect on student
performance, policy making would be straightforward. State and national governments could decide how
much money to invest in schools and could trust local districts to apply funds in a productive manner. But,
the fact that local districts do not use funds effectively complicates this picture. The clearest message of
existing research is that uniform resource policies are unlikely to work as intended.
The considerations of overall spending levels, either in legislatures or the courts, largely rest on the
premise that local districts are best situated and motivated to use funds wisely and productively. The
evidence currently does not support the effectiveness of local decision making in the current environment.
There is ample evidence, moreover, that policy makers do not fully believe that local decision makers will
do a good job. The extensive bodies of rules and regulations at the federal and state level are mainly
46

designed to ensure that local districts do not do undesirable things in operating their schools and indicate a
considerable distrust of the motivations and/or abilities of local districts. This, of course, runs into similar
information problems. To set regulations appropriately, one would need to know how resources or process
considerations affect student performance—which we do not know in any way sufficient for designing most
regulatory approaches to good schooling.
An alternative perspective is simply that current incentives, within the public provision of
schooling, do not motivate schools toward improving student performance (Hanushek and others (1994)).
The simple premise is that the unresponsiveness of performance to resources is largely a reflection that very
little rests on student performance. Good and bad teachers or good and bad administrators can expect about
the same career progressions, pay, and other outcomes—making the choice of programs, organization, and
behaviors less dependent on student outcomes than on other things that directly affect the actors in schools.
Such a description is, however, itself much too simple, because we have limited experience with
alternative incentive schemes (Hanushek and others (1994)). The alternative incentive structures include a
variety of conceptual approaches to providing rewards for improved student performance and range from
merit pay for teachers to privatization and vouchers. Performance incentives recognize that there might be
varying approaches by teachers and schools that are productive. Thus, they avoid the centralized
“command and control” perspective of much current policy. At the same time, they recognize that simply
decentralizing decision making is unlikely to work effectively unless there exist clear objectives and unless
there is direct accountability.59 Nonetheless, while some evidence is provided below, limited information is
available about the design and impact of alternative incentive schemes in schools.
The existing work does not suggest resources never matter, but it also cannot describe
circumstances where resources are used well. It does clearly indicate that the current organization and
incentives of schools do little to ensure that any added resources will be used effectively.

59

While the decentralization considered here really refers to pure resource policies and general funding, the
evidence supports this conclusion even at the level of school based management; see Summers and Johnson (1996).
47

Controversies

The preceding interpretations of the general ineffectiveness of school resource policies have been
challenged on several grounds. The challenges generally suggest that the evidence and its interpretation
may be biased.

Causality
A key issue in considering the results of the educational production function studies is whether they
identify causal relationships. Resource allocations are determined by a complicated series of political and
behavioral choices by schools and parents. The character of these choices could influence the estimates of
the effectiveness of resources. Consider, for example, the result of systematically assigning school
resources in a compensatory manner. If low achieving kids are given extra resources – say smaller classes,
special remedial instruction, improved technology, and the like – there is an obvious identification problem.
Low class size could simply mean kids need more help. Issues of this kind suggest both care in
interpretation of results and the possible necessity of alternative approaches.
At the individual student level, correlations with aggregate district resources through either formula
allocations or community decisions are not a major cause of concern. The classroom allocations may,
however, be a concern. For example, within a school, low achievers may be placed in smaller classes,
suggesting the possibility of simultaneity bias. Any such problems should be largely ameliorated by valueadded models, which consider the student’s prior achievement directly. The only concern then becomes
allocations made on the basis of unmeasured achievement influences that are unrelated to prior
achievement.
Lazear (2001) develops an optimizing model that provides motivation for the decisions of schools
in setting class size. His theoretical model, based on profit maximizing schools, emphasizes the externality
related to disruptive students. One key issue in the context of the previous empirical results is whether
48

variations in disruption probabilities should be thought of as exogenous or whether alternatively they
represent components of the teacher’s classroom management ability, i.e., elements of teacher skill. Such a
distinction is obviously very important in interpreting the model and the implications of it. While his model
underscores the ambiguities of estimating reduced form models, the appropriate approach for testing the
overall model or for estimating the behavioral equations is not developed.
Particularly in the area of class size analysis, a variety of approaches do go further in attempting to
identify causal effects, and the results are quite varied. Hoxby (2000b) used de-trended variations in the
size of birth cohorts to identify exogenous changes in class size in small Connecticut towns. Changes in
cohort sizes, coupled with the lumpiness of classes in small school districts, can provide variations in class
size that are unrelated to other factors. After pursuing her instrument strategy, she finds no significant
impact of class size on achievement. Other studies have used aggregation approaches (by school or state) to
construct instrumental variables estimators for the effects of class size (Akerhielm (1995); Boozer and
Rouse (1995)) and have found more positive effects.
Several international studies have also pursued instrumental variables strategies that rely upon
specific institutional structure. Angrist and Lavy (1999) note that Maimonides’ Rule requires that Israeli
classes cannot exceed forty students, so that, like in Hoxby’s analysis, the lumpiness of classrooms may lead
to large changes in class size when the numbers of students in a school approaches multiples of forty (and
the preferred class size is greater than forty). They formulate a regression discontinuity approach to identify
the effects of class size, but many of their estimates also use class size variation other than that generated by
the discontinuities. The results provide generally positive but varying support for the effects of class size in
different grades and circumstances. Case and Deaton (1999) rely upon the distinct policy regime of
apartheid in South Africa to identify the effects of changes in resources and class size for black citizens.
They argue that mobility restrictions and white decision making break the possible correlation of resources
and individual errors, allowing them to identify the causal impact of resources. They find a significant

49

positive relationship between pupil-teacher ratios (interpreted more generally as overall resources) and both
attainment and achievement. Hanushek and Luque (forthcoming), using the TIMSS data, perform a crosscountry analysis restricted just to rural schools where mobility is restricted and schools frequently have a
single classroom in the relevant grade, eliminating the normal concern about compensatory decision
making. They not only find little evidence of consistent benefits from class size reduction but instead tend
to find class size is positively related to achievement.60 A final alternative is Lindahl (2000), who
hypothesizes that differential summer learning across students could mask the importance of differences in
school resources. Employing achievement data on a sample of Swedish students, the effects of resources
are identified by assuming that parental inputs are the same in the summer and in the school year, while
school inputs operate only during the school year. He estimates significant effects of class size
differences.61
Unfortunately, identification of truly exogenous determinants of class size, or resource allocations
more generally, is sufficiently rare that other compromises in the data and modeling are frequently required.
These coincidental compromises jeopardize the ability to obtain unbiased estimates of resource effects and
may limit the generalizability of any findings. Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2001), employing better data of
multiple cohort panels, make use of exogenous variations in class sizes within Texas schools across grades
and cohorts to identify the impact of class size. The very large samples in that analysis provide estimates of
small but statistically significant effects of class size on performance for earlier grades but not later grades
and that the effects vary with student background.62
60

A second approach removes a common achievement difference if the student’s classroom is below the
average for the grade, thus removing an average compensatory effect (if it exists) for each country. This approach
similarly leads to little difference from the basic estimation.
61

This analysis follows prior work on summer learning differentials (e.g., Heyns (1978); [Entwisle and
Alexander (1992)), but he also suggests implications for the analysis of school differences. He concludes that the
previous value-added specifications may be tainted by differential summer learning.
62

The large samples in that analysis, approaching one million students, permit very precise estimates of the
small effects. Krueger (1999) suggests that one reason many estimates are statistically insignificant is that the
underlying parameter is very small and the typical estimation sample is insufficiently large to discriminate between
small and zero. Of course, the small size of the parameter is relevant for any policy deliberations, because small
50

In sum, these alternative approaches yield inconsistent results both in terms of class size effects and
in terms of the effects of alternative methodologies. The results in each of these studies tend to be quite
sensitive to estimation procedures and to model specification. As a group, nonetheless, the results are more
likely to be statistically significant with the expected sign than those presented previously for all studies, but
the typical estimate (for statistically significant estimates) tends to be very small in magnitude. At the same
time, the results of these approaches are inconsistent in terms of statistical significance, grade pattern, and
magnitude of any effects, making it difficult to understand to what circumstances any results might
generalize.
Consideration of the determination of school inputs has not been undertaken systematically,
although anecdotal evidence suggests that it should be given more attention. For example, many teacher
contracts in the United States allow more experienced teachers to choose the schools where they teach,
leading to the previous concerns about the underlying behavior behind estimated achievement and
experience relationships (Greenberg and McCall (1974); Murnane (1981); Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin
(2001c)). At the same time, little has been done on overall expenditure determination and its possible
effects.63 Similarly, while various policies and incentives drive much of the education of teachers, the
effects of this have not generally been integrated into the achievement analysis.
While these topics are reconsidered below, it is clear that further work into the determination of
resource patterns and the relationship to production function analysis is an important area for additional
research. The difficulty of course is finding ways to identify the separate relationships in a convincing
manner.

effects must be compared to the costly nature of the interventions.
63

Some work has considered specific expenditures, such as special education (see, for example, Lankford
and Wyckoff (1996); Cullen (forthcoming)). General expenditure determination and its effects on production
function estimation has not, however, received much attention.
51

Labor Market Outcomes
Taken as a group, the production function studies give little indication that variations of resources
have anything to do with present variations in student performance. The overall findings related, for
example, to teacher-pupil ratios are dominated by estimates for test score measures of outcomes (217 out of
276). Test scores are nonetheless not generally the ultimate object of educational policy, but their use
instead reflects growing evidence suggesting variations in test scores have important effects in the labor
market. However, the widely-publicized findings of Card and Krueger (1992a) are taken as contrary
evidence to the general picture given previously by indicating that variations in school resources are related
to earnings differences among workers.64 Some discussion has suggested that the most important difference
between this latter study and the bulk of those reported previously comes from the measurement of
outcomes, i.e., labor market experiences versus (typically) test scores (see Burtless (1996a)).
On the other hand, the test score-earnings linkage previously discussed provides a prima facie case
that outcome measurement is not the source of difference. Moreover, specific reviews of the larger set of
estimates in the resource-earnings literature suggest no significant differences from the overall results
presented above (Betts (1996); Hanushek (1997a)). Yet, because of frequent citations of the different
findings by Card and Krueger, it is useful to investigate the possible sources of the differences.
The divergent findings may simply be explained by variations in the level and environment of
schooling across different eras. The Card and Krueger (1992a) analysis begins with samples of adult
workers from the 1970 and 1980 Censuses of Population and fills in information about the schooling
circumstances of individuals from information about their year and state of birth. The workers in their
sample attended schools between the 1920s and the 1970s, implying variations in the level of resources
going far beyond what is found today. If added resources have diminishing effects on student achievement,

64

The Card and Krueger (1992a) analysis of school resources and earnings is the most discussed, but it
follows a larger line of research. See, for example, Welch (1966), Johnson and Stafford (1973), and Wachtel (1976).
An insightful review of past studies that considers underlying characteristics of the studies is Betts (1996).
52

current school operations may be largely "on the flat" of the production function, while Card and Krueger
observe ranges from the past where resources had stronger effects.65
A related possibility might be that the political economy of schools has changed over time. For
example, with the rise of teachers unions and the resulting change in bargaining positions, resources might
be used in different ways and have different student achievement implications now than in the past (e.g.,
Borland and Howsen (1992); Peltzman (1993); Hoxby (1996b)). In other words, it is quite possible that the
enormous changes in educational resources did have an effect on outcomes in the first half of the 20th
century, but that more recent studies are also correct in finding no effect for the sorts of resource changes
discussed in current schools.
Nonetheless, the most important set of reasons for the different conclusions likely involves
specification issues. To begin with, many of the direct analyses of earnings include just the level of school
resources, but none of the other factors that might influence student achievement and skill development. For
example, it is plausible that students attending schools with a high level of resources also have parents who
contribute more time, energy, and money to their education. If parental inputs are left out of the calculation,
any estimated effects of school resources would tend to overstate the true independent effect of resources.66
Further, as pointed out above, aggregation of school inputs is also likely to exacerbate any biases due to
specification issues (Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996)). Most of the earnings analyses observe school
resources measured only at the aggregate state level. The Card-Krueger estimate comes from resource data

65

The key element is that at high levels of resources the marginal productivity of added resources may be
significantly less than at low levels of resources. While not a direct test of this on-the-flat thesis, the lack of
significantly stronger resource effects in developing countries introduces some question about this hypothesis; see
Hanushek (1995), or, in a growth context, Hanushek and Kimko (2000).
66

For example, Card and Krueger (1992b) do not include any family background factors, so – in addition to
the general aggregations issues of missing state policies – the effects of pupil-teacher ratios will be confounded with
any family factors that are correlated at the state level. They stratify by race but include no measures of family
background variations that might permit identification of a pure effect of pupil-teacher ratios.
53

aggregated to the state level, but no measures of state policy differences are included, so their estimates are
subject to this bias.67
As critiques by Speakman and Welch (1995) and Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996a,
1996b) show, the Card and Krueger (1992a) estimates are very sensitive to the specific estimation
procedure. Moreover, the state earnings differences cannot be interpreted in terms of school quality
differences in the way that Card and Krueger interpret them. In order to identify their estimates of school
quality, Card and Krueger (1992a) must assume that the migration of people across states is random and not
based on differential earnings opportunities. Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996a, 1996b) show that
there is selective migration and that this fundamental requirement for their interpretation is untrue.68
Thus, while some of the discrepancy in results could be attributed to different changes in schools
over time, much of it appears to arise simply from the analytical problems in Card and Krueger (1992a). In
more general consideration going beyond this specific paper, there appears to be little difference in results.

Meta-Analysis and the Summary of Results
Alternative procedures exist for summarizing the results of studies. These approaches, more
common to other fields of study, sometimes go under the general title of "meta-analysis." A preferred
approach to assessing disparate results would involve combining the underlying data of the studies directly
to develop statistical inferences and tests of hypotheses across the studies. Unfortunately the original data
are seldom available for reanalysis—and even when they are, combining data from different sources can be
difficult—which forces a variety of compromises in the aggregation of results. The previous data on studies

67

If, on the other hand, there are important measurement errors in the school resources, aggregation could be
beneficial because this would tend to average out any measurement problems. A central concern of Hanushek,
Rivkin, and Taylor (1996) is distinguishing between the harmful effects of aggregation and model misspecification
and the beneficial effects of aggregation and measurement error. That analysis rejects the hypothesis that
measurement error is a primary element in the apparent importance of resources in the more aggregated studies.
68

They also show that the results differ significantly across time and that they are very sensitive to the
precise specification of the models. Speakman and Welch (1995) further show that virtually all of the effects of state
school resources work through earnings of college attendees, even though the resource measures relate only to
elementary and secondary schools.
54

in Tables 6-8 represent one approach to the aggregation of results, an approach which relies on the minimal
set of factors standardly reported. But, instead of simply reporting the distribution of results, others have
attempted to do formal statistical tests.69 An attempt to apply formal statistical tests to education production
function data is found in Hedges, Laine, and Greenwald (1994) and Greenwald, Hedges, and Laine (1996).
They wish to do formal hypothesis testing using the available data from essentially the same set of
published studies employed here.70 The most basic problem with their statistical analysis is that it fails to
address the fundamental problem of whether resources are consistently related to performance. Instead, the
question they pose is whether there is any evidence that resources or expenditure differences ever appear to
affect student performance. They explicitly test the null hypothesis that all parameters indicating the effect
of a specific resource on student performance are simultaneously equal to zero; i.e., Ho: β1=β2=. . .=βn=0,
where the βi are the underlying parameters relating a specific resource to student performance in one of the
n available estimates. If any single underlying parameter (i.e., one βi ) for the combined sample of studies
across varied schooling circumstances is not zero, the null hypothesis is false (that is, someplace there is an
effect on student performance). Their statistical procedures are designed in such a case to reject the null
hypothesis, leading to acceptance of the alternative that at least one study indicated the resource was related
to performance.71 They reject the null, but it does not change the overall interpretation of the econometric
results.

69

The primary argument against the simple tabulations, or vote-counting, employed here derives from the
stylized analysis of combining a series of small experiments employing tests with low power, where more studies can
actually lead to false conclusions. These examples have little relevance to the statistical tests developed in a
regression framework with the very large samples frequently available.
70

Some of the problems with doing this are immediately evident. Combining testing information is best
motivated from thinking about variations in estimates of a single common parameter, something that hard to define
given the variations in underlying model specifications. More importantly, published articles frequently do not (and
cannot) provide sufficient information. For example, if parameter estimates are correlated across studies, say because
they reflect performance in different grades of one school district, estimation of the combined variance of the
estimator would require knowledge of the covariances--something that is never provided. Problems on
nonindependence enter into the tabulations previously presented, but they are clearly less central to the interpretation
of the results than in the case of combined significance testing.
71

In discussing precisely the issue of how to interpret rejection of this null hypothesis, Hedges and Olkin
55

Experimental Evidence (STAR Experiment)
In attempting to understand the effects of specific resources on student performance, an appealing
alternative to econometric estimation is the use of random assignment experiments. Such an approach can
overcome a variety of concerns raised above about selection, causation, and the like. In the mid1980s,
because of ambiguity about the effects of class size on student performance, the State of Tennessee
launched a random-assignment experiment in reducing class sizes. The design was heavily influenced by
an early summary of research by Glass and Smith (1979) that suggested student achievement was roughly
constant across class sizes until the class size got down to approximately 15 to 1. After 15 to 1, reductions
in class size appeared to yield gains in student performance. Based on this, a group of kindergarten through
third graders in Tennessee was randomly assigned to either large classes (22-24 students) or small classes
(14-16 students).72 Students were followed over time as they progressed from kindergarten through third
grade.
The student testing shows that children in smaller classes did better at the end of kindergarten and
that this better performance was maintained through the third grade. This evidence is sometimes taken as
refuting the econometric evidence on teacher-pupil ratios that was presented earlier, but two aspects are
important to consider. First, while the use of experimentation is an important research approach (Hanushek
and others (1994); Mosteller (1995)), the actual implementation of this experiment is open to question.
Second, the findings, which pertain to a very large policy change in very specific circumstances, yielded
small and difficult to interpret results.
A number of questions arise about the quality of the randomization in the STAR experiment.
Specifically, because of lack of data, it is difficult to assess the randomization of students or teachers into

(1985), state, “It is doubtful if a researcher would regard such a situation as persuasive evidence of the efficacy of a
treatment” (p. 45).
72

The design was actually more complicated. The large classes were broken into two groups, one with
teacher aides and one without aides. To be eligible for participating in the experiment, a school also had to be large
enough so as to ensure that there was at least one small and large class. For a description the experiment and the
basic results, see Word et al. (1990).
56

the experiment. There was substantial nonrandom attrition from the experiment; 51 percent of students
initially in the experiment left before the end of the experiment. Substantial numbers (up to 12 percent by
test) did not take annual tests; significant proportions of students changed experimental group (with the
largest numbers going from large to small classes) during the experiment. It is difficult to assess the impact
of any of these with the existing data (see Hanushek (1999); Krueger (1999)).
The second issue is interpretation of the results. The initial achievement differences found in the
year students entered a small class were maintained but did not become wider through the grades (Word et
al. (1990); Krueger (1999)). Because they continue to get more resources (smaller classes), these resources
should, according to the general hypothesis, keep producing a growing advantage. Figure 1 shows the
difference in reading performance in small classes that was observed across grades in Project STAR. (The
results for math performance are virtually identical in size and pattern). It also shows how the observed
outcomes diverge from what would be expected if the impact in kindergarten were also obtained in later
grades.
Even if taken at face value, however, a significant issue remains: To what circumstances should the
results be generalized?73 The Tennessee experiment identified performance differences related to very large
changes in class size at the entry into school. No similar experimental evidence looks at schools outside of
Tennessee, at later grades, at smaller reductions, or at different absolute levels of class size. The previous
econometric evidence found that some introductions of lower class appeared effective, even if across the
board results were unlikely. But, like the Tennessee results, there is no indication from the econometric
studies of when class size reduction is likely to work.
In sum, the potential application of random assignment experiments to schools is a very important
innovation. Indeed, it offers an attractive alternative to the more common event, moving directly to major

73

A second significant issue, discussed below, is whether the resulting effects large enough to justify further
policy initiatives? The magnitude of the difference in performance is very small: a 1/3 reduction in class size over
four years produced an average gain of about 0.2 standard deviations of student achievement.
57

public funding of full-scale programs.74 The existing results from the one major experiment that exists,
however, do not offer any substantial contradiction to the previous econometric findings.

Consumer behavior
The concept of increased consumer choice with respect to schools has been high on a variety of
reform agendas. At the same time there is considerable choice of schools that comes through residential
choice that is frequently tied to specific schools. While moving residence is clearly costly and clearly
provides a blunt instrument for school choice, it nonetheless operates on the margin. Each year one-fifth of
American households change location, allowing considerable room for exercising consumer choice of
schools. An issue here is whether this choice by consumers affects the results observed about the operations
of schools.75
A general conceptual argument against the inefficiency in school provision revolves around
consumers and keys on notions of Tiebout moving behavior (Tiebout (1956)). Consumers appear to desire
higher spending for schools; if wasted, one would expect lessened demand and/or moving of consumers to
districts where there was more efficient production. This in turn would put pressure on districts to become
more efficient.
The evidence suggests that there is consumer pressure, but that it is insufficient to overcome the
existing variations in efficiency. The one direct investigation of jurisdictional competition is Hoxby

74

In 1996, the State of California moved to a statewide program of providing significant additional funds to
all schools that lowered class sizes in primary grades to state-prescribed levels. This program appears to have been
the policy implementation of perceived results from the STAR experiment. Having done this on a statewide basis,
there is also no effective way to evaluate the results of such an initiative, so that neither California nor other states
can learn from this program. The existing evidence provides little reason to be optimistic about the future
achievement effects of this policy Stecher and Bohrnstedt (1999).
75

A different perspective on Tiebout effects comes from consideration of estimation of expenditure demand
functions, where choice of communities by families will generally lead to overstating the income elasticity of demand
Goldstein and Pauly (1981), Bergstrom, Rubinfeld, and Shapiro (1982), Gramlich and Rubinfeld (1982), and
58

(2000a) that considers how the numbers of districts in a metropolitan area – a measure of the potential for
Tiebout competition – affects performance of the public schools.76 She finds that more competition
increases outcomes measured by test scores, attainment, and early career earnings. She also suggests that
districts are more efficient when there is more competition among districts.
Most work has not focused directly on the relationship between school efficiency and consumer
behavior but instead has investigated pieces of consumer choices. First, consumers have been shown to be
willing to pay for schools with higher test performance. In particular, estimation of hedonic price indices
for housing, beginning with Kain and Quigley (1975) and Rosen and Fullerton (1977), demonstrate positive
effects of school achievement levels on housing demand. More recently, Black (1999) refines this approach
by considering houses very close to school district boundaries – where contamination of unmeasured
neighborhood quality is likely to be small – and finds that test scores of local schools have a strong effect on
house prices. Similarly, Weimer and Wolkoff (2001) confirm such within district capitalization of school
performance. Second, consideration of the political economy of school budgeting suggests that budget
maximizing bureaucrats may act to push expenditure above the optimum (Romer and Rosenthal (1979);
Filimon, Romer, and Rosenthal (1982); Romer, Rosenthal, and Munley (1992); Inman (1987); Rothstein
(1992)). By gaming voters in the face of budget reversion levels, bureaucrats are able to push the median
voter above her optimum spending level. Third, investigations of demand for spending – which typically
assumes that expenditure is the same as quantity demanded – have paid no attention to quality of
governmental services (e.g., Borcherding and Deacon (1972); Bergstrom and Goodman (1973); Poterba
(1997)). In short, most existing analyses do not consider either consumer awareness of inefficiencies or
consumer reactions to any inefficiencies.

Rubinfeld, Shapiro, and Roberts (1987).
76

The underlying analysis uses instrumental variables (based on local geography) to circumvent endogeneity
problems with district choice. The estimates of Tiebout choice effects disappear when endogeneity is not considered.
An alternative set of estimates of public school choice on outcomes is found in Hanushek and Rivkin (forthcoming).
59

An alternative view of the forces behind the inefficiency of schools relates to self-interest of school
personnel. Pritchett and Filmer (1999) consider how the interests of school personnel align with the
decisions that are made and conclude that such self-interest appears important. Because of the special role
of school personnel in setting policy, these forces could distort the preferences and choices of consumers.
A basic problem with all of these indirect approaches is the failure to distinguish school quality, or
the value-added by schools, from the level of achievement in a school. Indeed, this is almost certainly the
problem facing consumers and offers an explanation for remaining inefficiency. Without information about
the contributions of families and of schools, consumers face a critical information problem. This
information problem, which by all accounts appears to be serious, will in turn lead consumers to make
nonoptimal decisions about location, school spending, and the degree of inefficiency that exists in local
schools.
The analysis of school changing by Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a) does suggest that parents
obtain reasonable (value-added) information about school quality, even though such information is not
directly provided by standard accountability systems. A difficulty in analyzing choice through mobility is
that families move for a wide variety of reasons including changes in jobs and family circumstances. Some
of these underlying causes will directly affect student performance, and the analysis of school choice must
take this into account. The analysis in Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a) concentrates on long run
achievement effects of a move, under the presumption that the effects of other factors die out after a move,
and finds that families moving to and within suburban areas tend to increase their children’s achievement.
Clearly, the role of consumers within the determination of school policies and outcomes is an area
for research, because the role of consumer demand is central to many perspectives on schools. We return to
part of this issue below.

Inefficiency and estimation approach
Another approach to estimating production frontiers involves variants of mathematical

60

programming models or imposition of assumptions about the errors in an econometric formulation to
capture the frontier notion. The underlying production theory calls for estimating the maximum feasible
output from a set of inputs. If inefficiency exists in some schools, estimation should conceptually take it
into account. The approaches follow a variety of estimation strategies with data envelope analysis (DEA)
being one of the more common (see, for example, the early work in Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) or
Ruggiero (1996) and the references in it). Related work along more conventional econometric lines
concentrates on the specialized nature of the error term that would be generated in the context of a
production frontier (e.g., Aigner and Chu (1968); Aigner, Lovell, and Schmidt (1977). An extension
combining some features of both can be found in Grosskopf et al. (1997).
The programming model has been used chiefly to consider both the trade-off between alternative
outcomes (e.g., math and reading or test scores and graduation rates) and to uncover the most efficient way
to produce these outcomes. The basic idea is that an efficient school is one producing the maximum output
for its inputs. The estimation then constrains schools to lie on or below the production frontier. As is typical
of these approaches, the number of “efficient” schools will be the same as the number of separate inputs,
and all other schools will be compared to the efficient ones. Since this approach provides a direct measure
of efficiency, it is conceptually possible to investigate how consumers behave when faced with varying
efficiency. These approaches, however, suffer from the presumption that the small number of inputs fully
captures the relevant production factors and that no measurement error exists.77 For computational reasons,
only a small number of inputs are considered, and these often do not take into account the influence of
family background or other nonschool factors. But to fit the underlying theory, it must be the case that other
firms can reproduce the output of the efficient firm – which would not be really possible if performance
relied on other unmeasured inputs such as managerial skill or missing dimensions of teacher quality.
The stochastic versions relax these assumptions by explicitly including a one-sided error for

77

Because they do not begin with a stochastic formulation, the programming approaches typically do not
yield information about the statistical significance of any parameter estimates.
61

efficiency (constrained to be less than zero) along with a symmetric error. That is, considering the error in
equation (1).

υ it = εit + ηjt

where individual i attends school j during year t and school j has a stochastic efficiency term with ηjt≤0. If
η is uncorrelated with the family and school inputs, then ordinary least squares estimation provides
consistent estimation and, with specification of the distributions of ε and η, maximum likelihood provides
efficient estimates. But, of course, the key assumption is that inefficiency is uncorrelated with any of the
observed inputs – an unlikely event unless there is truly nothing systematic about the efficiency of schools.
A variety of approaches expand on these models to incorporate both the notions of production frontiers
involving multiple outputs and stochastic elements (see, for example, Grosskopf et al. (1997)), but these
will be subject to the same underlying issues.
The investigation of inefficiency by schools is clearly a worthwhile pursuit, especially in light of the
previous evidence about performance of schools. Nevertheless, the current limitations of programming
solutions and other econometric approaches appear overwhelming.

Multiple outputs
Much of the analysis of school performance treats the production of achievement in a given area as
independent of that in other areas. Thus, for example, the determination of mathematics performance is
separate from that of reading performance. If, however, schools are actively deciding among outcomes and
they compete for resources (generally denominated in terms of time), differences in performance among
schools when measured in a single dimension may simply reflect different motivation to produce a given
array of outputs. That is, a school emphasizing reading may look inefficient in the production of
mathematics if the performance in mathematics is compared to the total set of inputs to the school. A

62

number of studies have directly investigated varying student performance in a multiple outcome fashion
through traditional simultaneous equations estimation (e.g., Levin, 1970; Boardman, Davis, and Sanday
1974). The problem in this estimation is the difficulty in identifying the separate equations for each
outcome – because it is generally difficult to find factors that affect one outcome but not the others. One
novel approach, however, is Brown and Saks (1975). In their formulation, school districts are portrayed as
maximizing a welfare function defined over both the level and the variance in achievement. They then
estimate reduced form equations for each. They demonstrate that, while school resources are not
systematically related to the level of achievement in a majority of the estimates, their apparent strength is
increased by also considering the variance in performance. One difficulty with this approach is that it rests
upon a presumed common objective function that is not observable. Thus, much like the problems of
basing estimates of consumer demand functions on the researcher’s presumption of the utility function, this
analysis gets it power from specifying the elements of the common preferences of school districts. But,
again, the largest problem is that identification of the underlying structural parameters is not possible,
making the application of this less useful for any policy purposes.
The common solution for maximizing multiproduct production functions requires some source of
the relative weights for each output – making prices particularly attractive in the analysis of general firm
behavior. Such prices are not readily available for school outputs.
The previously discussed data envelope analysis (DEA) lists as one of its virtues the ability to
handle multiple outputs. Contrary to the normal production theory optimization, outputs are not aggregated
according to any simple value maximization process. A discussion of the criteria employed can be found in
Grosskopf et al. (1997). A key element in this aggregation is that any inefficiency is found in the
transformation of inputs into aggregate output, as opposed to finding the output combination that maximizes
any social welfare function.78

78

An alternative statistical approach to dealing with multiple outputs is the estimation of canonical
correlation models (e.g., Gyimah-Brempong and Byapong (1991)). These methods use statistical criteria to maximize
63

Finally, by going to the dual of the production problem it is possible to frame the estimation in
terms of cost functions (e.g., Downes and Pogue (1994) or Duncombe, Ruggiero, and Yinger (1996)).79
With maximization, this approach provides an alternative estimation approach that can characterize directly
the relationships among various outputs. But the estimation relies not only on maximization of outcomes
but also on having accurate measures of input prices. Input prices are particularly problematic with respect
to the primary input – teachers. As discussed below, the supply function for teachers of varying quality is
unknown, making it difficult to integrate into the production analysis.
Many policy discussions relate directly to consideration of varying outcomes of the educational
process, yet little is known either about the trade-offs that are present or about differential consumer demand
for outcomes. As data on multiple outcomes increasingly become available, the possibilities of inferring
consumer demand from behavior and choices expand.

Cost Considerations

One remarkable aspect of most considerations of educational performance and school decisions is a
general lack of attention to the costs of alternatives. Perhaps because the evidence about systematic effects
of different programs, of different attributes of schools, or of various other inputs has been so inconsistent,
most attention has focused on whether or not a particular input has a positive and statistically significant
effect on achievement. But knowing that something might be expected to improve student performance is
insufficient to make it the object of public policy. One would clearly want to know whether there were
alternative uses of funds that produced higher achievement, or even higher value outside of schools.

the correlation of aggregate outputs and inputs, but the criteria in general is not clearly related to underlying structural
models or optimization on the part of schools.
79

These dual approaches also yield qualitatively the same results as the direct expenditure studies except that
the impacts are inverted. An expenditure parameter in a production function estimate that is close to zero translates
into a very large cost of obtaining any given student outcome. Thus, for example, Duncombe, Ruggiero, and Yinger
(1996) suggest implausibly that it costs two and half times as much to achieve a gain in achievement in some
64

The policy problem is easy to see in the case of discussions of policies to reduce class size. Most of
the debate has centered on whether one can expect any achievement gain from a simple policy of reducing
class sizes. But even if one takes the results of the Tennessee STAR experiment as accurate, they suggest a
very small magnitude of effect on performance: a 1/3 reduction in class size over four years produced an
average gain of about 0.2 standard deviations of student achievement (Krueger (1999)).80 Any
consideration of class size reductions should clearly be put in terms of the cost of the program and
alternative uses of funds.
An important part of the problem, however, is that the cost of alternative inputs is not well
understood. In order to assess the relative benefits of employing alternative inputs, it would be appropriate
to weight by the cost of each input. Yet, particularly when the inputs reflect different attributes of teachers
(e.g., experience) or inputs (e.g., science laboratory quality), little information is available about costs of the
inputs.81
Teachers are perhaps the best example. It is possible to identify how effective different salaries are
in attracting a pool of teachers without regard to their characteristics (Murnane et al. (1991)). It is also
possible to make some assessment about the relationship between salaries and specific characteristics of
teachers (e.g., Hanushek and Pace (1995); Ballou (1996); Ballou and Podgursky (1997)) or labor markets
(Toder (1972); Antos and Rosen (1975); Chambers (1977); Levinson (1988)). More generally,
compensating differentials for teachers may lead to nominal salary differentials that are misleading in terms
of individual decision making (e.g. Loeb and Page (2000)). Finally, by looking across time, one can see
how teacher salaries cut the distribution of all college graduates, as a possible indication of the overall

downstate New York districts as compared to the average school district in New York State.
80

These estimates are roughly similar to those for disadvantaged fourth grade students found in Rivkin,
Hanushek, and Kain (2001), but considerably larger than those for more advantaged students. Putting these results
into cost terms reinforces the small magnitude of the estimates.
81

Levin and McEwan (2001) describe cost analysis based on adding the average cost of components of
programs. This approach moves in the right direction of introducing costs into educational decisions, but it cannot
deal with quality concerns and other reasons why the average and marginal cost might differ.
65

quality of teachers (Hanushek and Rivkin (1997); Flyer and Rosen (1997)). However, even suspending
concerns about the value of separate teacher attributes, the existing studies do not give sufficient
information to integrate any potential benefits with costs. Little progress has been on characterizing the
supply function for quality.
The analysis of teachers has been more detailed than analyses of other school inputs. Even such
apparently straightforward calculations as the costs of altering class size have been generally neglected.
When attempted, the difficulties become apparent, because the specification of precisely how the policy is
implemented along with other complementary changes that would be required has received little attention
(see, for example, Stecher and Bohrnstedt (1999)).
In many ways it is surprising that the discussion of costs is so short. Programmatic costs do not
seem to enter systematically in much educational decision making, suggesting a clear reason for observed
inefficiencies in resource use. It also suggests that investigation of costs, particularly for quality aspects of
school inputs, is a fertile area of study.

Institutional Structure and Incentives
The existing evidence is conditioned by the organization and structure of existing schools.
Specifically, the prevailing incentives in schools may not create very strong pressures for improving student
performance (Hanushek and others (1994)). Altered incentives, on the other hand, could potentially lead to
very different outcomes.
At the outset, however, it is important to note that a variety of incentives currently exist and that
school personnel respond to them. Traditionally few incentives have existed with respect to improved
student performance, but instead have pointed in other directions. For example, financial incentives from
state payments to schools for children in special education have distorted classification rates into special
education (Cullen (forthcoming). Or, unionization has influenced the efficiency of school and the patterns
of their resource usage (Hoxby (1996b)). Public schools also appear to react to consumer choices, perhaps
66

because of the relationship to property values discussed previously. In any event, schools facing wider
competition from other districts show improved performance and efficiency (Hoxby (2000a)). The issue is
not the existence of incentives but the direction, force, and focus of incentives. While consideration of
incentives derived from competition with public schools is considered next, some altered incentives have
been attempted within the public schools, and they are the focus of this section.
Perhaps the most discussed incentive topic is merit pay – providing differential pay for teachers
based on judgments of performance. Most people think this is a natural kind of policy, mimicking pay
systems found in other industries. The common evaluation of those policies attempted is that they fail
(Cohen and Murnane (1986); Hatry, Greiner, and Ashford (1994)). The generalizations are that these
systems tend to evolve into systems of relatively uniform pay and that they often tend to end up being extra
pay for extra work instead of extra pay for good performance. The lessons from existing attempts at merit
pay, however, remain unclear. Because performance contracts exist broadly outside of schools, it seems
necessary to describe why education is different from other sectors. For example, other areas, similar to
education, have difficulty in measuring the contributions of each individual in the firm and need
cooperation among workers – yet they maintain differentiated pay. Indeed, even closely related activities
like business schools use substantial merit systems and find considerable success (Brickley and Zimmerman
(2001)). Private nonsectarian schools appear to use merit pay more extensively than public schools (Ballou
(2001)) and also rely more frequent judgments about teachers and to let go teachers who are not performing
well (Ballou and Podgursky (1997)).
Part of the issue in assessing merit pay plans revolves around expectations for the incentives. Most
merit pay plans have been evaluated in terms of the performance of the existing teachers. This assessment
assumes that the most significant issue is whether or not teachers are trying hard to do well. If they are not,
merit pay may induce more and better efforts, leading to improved student performance. An alternative
view is that the most significant aspect of merit pay proposals revolves around changes in the stock of

67

teachers, or the selection issue. Merit pay schemes might provide incentives for better teachers to stay and
for poorer teachers to leave and thus may have little to do with variations in effort. Existing evaluations
have not focused on the employment aspects.
Schools have not made much use of personnel incentive systems developed in other industries. Nor
have they considered the theoretical literature developed for other organizations. A key element of parts of
this has to do with partial measurement performance and the potential incentives set up by this within
organizations (e.g., Baker (1992, forthcoming)).
A key element in any individual-specific accountability system is accurate and reliable
measurement of performance. On this score, a variety of approaches have related student performance
directly to teachers. Most notable is the Tennessee Value-Added Assessment System (TVAAS) that is
mandated by state law but does not include rewards or sanctions for individual teachers (Sanders and Horn
(1994, 1995)). Alternative approaches have been developed in Dallas, Texas (Mendro et al. (1998)) and
would include the previously discussed statistical models for estimating teacher effects. A variety of
concerns have been raised about relying specifically on student test performance, including undue focus on
tests that partially measure performance, but importantly there is evidence that principal ratings are highly
correlated with estimates of value-added by teachers (Murnane (1975), Armor et al. (1976)). Nonetheless,
analysis of methodology for evaluating teachers on the basis of performance and of incentive systems that
utilize such information remains limited.
States have, however, moved away from developing teacher-specific incentive systems and toward
group ratings and accountability. A currently popular reform approach – standards based reform and school
accountability – can be thought of as providing different incentives, although some incentives in these
reform efforts are quite confused (Hanushek and Raymond (2001)).82 The clearest expression of this is the
82

The evaluation of behavior under different accountability systems is currently limited, although it is likely
to expand rapidly as increased testing and use of varying accountability systems expands. For example, Deere and
Strayer (2001) suggest that individuals react to public accountability systems but that some of the reaction may not be
desirable. An initial evaluation of the Florida program for using vouchers to deal with failing schools has led to
considerable controversy over the interpretation of the incentives; see Greene (2001a, 2001b) and Carnoy (2001).
68

develop of accountability systems that report the scores of students in a school and that may condition
rewards on student performance. The approach highlights student performance, often calling for explicit
measurement of outcomes along with mechanisms for aiding school to perform better. For example, a
number of states have moved to substantial rewards to schools that perform highly on the state standards.83
On the other hand, little existing evaluation has been conducted.84 Much of the discussion has concentrated
on the explicit evaluation of outcomes (e.g., Koretz (1996)).
Some innovative theoretical modeling has begun to describe some of the competing forces
generated by many of the common accountability systems that have emerged with standards based reform
(Betts and Costrell (2001)). They demonstrate some surprising outcomes when accountability systems have
multiple roles.
The movement of policy toward accountability system and standards based reform has some
important antecedents in the work of John Bishop. In a series of papers he hypothesizes that centralized
testing systems have powerful incentive effects on students (for example, Bishop (1996); Bishop et al.
(2001)). He argues that the strength of incentives for students differ dramatically when there is a
consequential central examination as compared with, say, relative grading by classroom teachers. While
evaluating this proposition is difficult since testing regimes tend to coincide with state or national
jurisdictions that make isolation of test effects difficult, the line of research highlights the importance of
students in the educational process. Most of the other analyses of achievement has stressed the role of
schools and has brought in students largely to the extent that they have fixed, but this line of inquiry
emphasizes the role of student behavior in affecting achievement and therefore brings in the necessity of

83

The idea of rewarding schools instead of teachers relates to arguments used against merit pay. Because
teachers must work with each other in a variety of ways, an incentive system that led to “hoarding” of information by
teachers or general lack of cooperation would be unfortunate. There has been little analysis of such approaches.
84

Conducting evaluations of existing state plans for accountability is very difficult. Because many plans
cover entire states, it is necessary to do comparative studies across states. But, many other state policies are
simultaneously affecting schools in each state. As discussed previously, problems of misspecification and aggregation
to state levels can severely distort any such analysis.
69

incentives for students as well as school personnel.
The general consideration of incentives provides the contrast between the traditional regulatory
approach to running schools and the value of identifying outcomes without detailing the approaches to
achieving them. The incentive approach has the advantage of not requiring detailed knowledge about the
production process in various local situations. Incentives, however, are not without their own
complications. Specifically, little experience indicates how to devise the best incentive structures, and the
details within the complex organization of schools are almost certainly very important. Some early
experimental work into incentive contracts provides a simple example. The U.S. Office of Economic
Opportunity, as part of the War on Poverty in the late 1960s and early 1970s, experimented with
performance contracting, i.e., providing firms direct payments based on the achievement of students to
whom they offered remedial instruction. In the end, virtually nothing was learned from the experiment
because the flawed contract led firms to react in ways that limited what could be learned about basic
approaches to remedial instruction (Gramlich and Koshel (1975)). The conclusion from this experiment
and other incentive designs is that considerably more research is necessary to understand the best approach
to designing incentives. The possibility of such research is likely to increase noticeably as education policy
increasingly recognizes the importance of incentives.

Public versus Private Provision
If one distinguishes between the financing and the provision of education, it is possible to consider
whether private schools, which perhaps have different incentive structures, perform better than public
schools. The importance of competition for public schools was emphasized early by Friedman (1962) and
has been discussed and implemented in a wide variety of forms. The investigation of this has nonetheless
proved to be difficult and controversial.

70

Since 1970, about 11 percent of the U.S. student population has attended private schools. The
private schools are overwhelmingly schools with a religious affiliation, but the religious affiliation has
changed dramatically over time. In 1997, 50 percent are Catholic, 35 percent were other religious schools,
and the remaining 15 percent are nonsectarian, but in 1970 three-quarters were Catholic (see Sander
(2001)). The private schools are restricted from receiving public funding, so those students attending
private schools pay tuition. Additionally, since the taxes to support the public schools – most of which are
property taxes at the local level – are paid regardless of attendance, students attending private schools in
essence pay for both public and private schooling.
The fundamental analytical question that has dominated the literature is whether or not performance
in private schools exceeds that in public schools ceteris paribus. In particular, if private school performance
exceeds that in the public schools, is it good schools or good kids?

Unsubsidized choice
Uncovering the relative advantage of public and private provision of education is confounded by
the underlying choice of schools. Consider the following stylized choice problem where attention is
concentrated just on public and Catholic schools for now.

(4)

Op = ƒp(F, P, S, A) + υp

(5)

Oc = ƒc(F, P, S, A) + υc

(6)

Prob(c) = g(F, P, S, A, X) + ε

71

Equations 4 and 5 (which follow directly from equation 1) describe production in the public (p) sector and
Catholic (c) sector. Equation 6 describes the selection equation governing choice of Catholic schools based
on the production characteristics and other factors, X, such as religious preferences.
The fundamental difficulty in uncovering the differences between public and private provision
comes from the selection equation. It is clear from the beginning that families that send their children to
private schools are different, because they could have attended the public schools but instead paid tuition to
attend the private school. Specifically, if parents with the largest interest in schooling tend simultaneously
to pick Catholic schooling and to provide more motivation or a better learning environment for their
children, υ and ε will be correlated. As is well known, the estimated effect of schools will be biased if the
production functions are estimated without taking into account the selection of parents.
The estimation of these relationships takes a variety of forms. The simplest forms of estimation
pursue two similar strategies. First, assuming the impact of families, peers, and school factors is the same
except for a level difference in performance, a pooled production function combining Equations 4 and 5 is
estimated with the addition of an indicator variable for attendance at a Catholic school (Neal (1997)).
Second, separate production functions are estimated within the public and Catholic school populations and
then the difference in performance is calculated by evaluating the production functions at common levels of
all of the inputs and comparing the predicted performance (e.g., Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore (1982)).
Both of these approaches, however, require attention to selection.85
Perhaps the most common approach to selection correction is to consider how own religious
preference affects choice of public or Catholic schools. The argument is that a Catholic background will
increase the chance that a student attends Catholic schools but will not affect the school outcome. But this

85

The investigation of relative performance of Catholic schools started intensively with Coleman and Hoffer
(1987). That analysis estimated separate public and Catholic school production functions and then standardized for
differing levels of inputs (F, P, and S) in deriving the differences in performance of the two types of schools. This
analysis started a heated controversy (see, for example, Noell (1982); Murnane, Newstead, and Olsen (1985)) over the
importance of selection in Catholic schools. Selection could also be dealt with through estimation of the choice
equation (Eq. 6), although it is difficult to do this in a way that also can realistically identify achievement
72

instrument would not be valid if, for example, Catholics on average had higher or lower abilities or were
more supportive of their children than nonCatholics. A better choice, however, is the density of Catholic
households or schools in an area (e.g., Neal (1997)). In any event, some variant of religious affiliation is
commonly employed, though the validity and usefulness of these instruments remains a matter of concern.
The stringent requirements for a valid instrument are generally difficult to meet. An alternative approach is
to consider value-added models where variations in early achievement are considered. This approach,
found in Coleman and Hoffer (1987), implicitly controls for selection if the outside factors entering into
achievement are summarized in the initial levels of achievement. Again, while this estimation strategy has
appeal, assessing whether any further selection effects remain is difficult.
The common result from estimation is that Catholic schools tend to achieve higher graduation rates
after making selection corrections and holding other input factors constant (see Evans and Schwab (1995);
Neal (1997); Grogger and Neal (2000)). At the same time, the estimation of effects on measured test scores
is not as clear. Estimation yields varying views of the effects of Catholic schools, and the results are
frequently not statistically different from zero (see the summary in Neal (1998)).
A key element of evaluation of relative performance is defining the relevant comparison. As Neal
(1997) demonstrates, comparisons of public and private schools differ significantly by the group considered.
While suburban public and private schools appear roughly comparable, urban Catholic schools, especially
those serving minority populations, appear noticeably superior on average to urban public schools. The
reasons for this difference in results have not been fully analyzed, but it is consistent with differential
abilities to move and to select schools. If poor and minority populations have limited ability to change
residences, and thus to select school districts, opening up choice through Catholic schools offers more
potential gain. It is also consistent with the possibility that urban schools are on average inferior to
suburban schools (cf. Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a)). Sander (1996), however, suggests that

relationships. See, on choice, Lankford and Wyckoff (1992).
73

heterogeneity of the population attending Catholic schools is important, with positive effects isolated in the
non-Catholic school population and no gains for Catholic students.
The variation in results by the measure of outcomes, if not a statistical artifact in the small number
of available studies, is difficult to interpret. Student achievement and graduation are closely related
according to past estimation, so it seems surprising that the influence of Catholic quality shows up in one
dimension but not the other. Yet, the differences in school completion continue through college graduation,
suggesting that these are significant differences. One possibility is that the statistical problems with the
achievement estimation are greater, but more attention is needed to the variations in performance across the
different outcomes.86
A larger problem with this line of research is that it provides no information on the distribution of
results. As discussed above, the bulk of research about educational production is aimed at understanding
the wide variation in performance of public schools. It seems natural to believe that Catholic schools also
exhibit wide variation in performance, although none of the existing analyses document either the
magnitude of differences or the potential causes of such differences. For example, assume that there is a
difference in the mean performance of Catholic schools compared to public schools. It is important to
understand whether this comes from a simple shifting of the entire quality distribution or from a truncation
in the bottom of the quality distribution or from a narrowing of the entire distribution with a loss at both the
top and bottom of the quality distribution. With the character of underlying changes in quality for Catholic
schools being unknown, there is an ambiguity about the exact lessons to be drawn for any policy purposes.
The comparison of Catholic and public schools is based entirely on performance, but a more
complete analysis would also incorporate the costs of production. Many observe that Catholic schools

86

The High School and Beyond survey, which is used in the Coleman work and others, employed a short test
that is likely to be noisy. Further, the sampling design behind the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS)
employed in Grogger and Neal (2000) makes selection on test taking important but difficult to deal with.
74

appear to be run with significantly lower expenditure levels, but accurate cost accounting is not readily
available.
One final area deserves attention. The focus on Catholic schools, or private schools more generally,
is motivated by the idea that more choice will lead to competition among schools that will then lead to
improve either in overall performance or in the effectiveness of resource usage. The competition for
students argument is the commonly held explanation for any difference in public-Catholic performance.
But, if that competition affects the Catholic schools, it should also affect the public schools. This effect on
public schools is in fact the primary interest in private school competition, because even a general widening
in the availability and access to private schools would leave a large public sector. Pursuing this theme,
Hoxby (1994) suggests that public schools located in areas where there is more competition from Catholic
schools perform better than comparable public schools facing less competition. This competition is
estimated to affect the level of output measured by educational attainment and graduate rates. Sander
(1999), on the other hand, does not find such spillovers, leaving the question of competitive impacts open.
Note, however, that if public schools react to the existence of private schools, the evaluation
problem becomes difficult. Any estimate of the performance difference of Catholic schools would
understate the true impact.

Subsidized choice

Much of the attention to choice and its impact on results emanates from early arguments by
Friedman (1962) about governmental provision of schools. He argued that, even if government had a role
in the financing of schools, it did not have to provide the service. Instead, by providing vouchers given to
parents, citizens would be able to choose among potential schools – both securing an education that suited
them and opening up competitive forces to improve the provision of schooling.

In the United States, with a few exceptions there has historically been limited general, publicly
supported choice. A number of states and districts have supported some kind of choice among public
schools. Part of this reflects efforts both to accommodate and to subvert the racial desegregation of U.S.
schools (Armor (1995)). Another part reflects efforts to provide more options and, implicitly, to broaden
competition. The latter efforts have included intradistrict and interdistrict school choice (Nathan (1989);
Hanushek and others (1994)) along with new efforts to free individual “charter” schools (Nathan (1996)).
In recent years, charter schools have dramatically expanded. 87 Hoxby (forthcoming)Subsidized choice
plans are to date considerably more limited: publicly provided vouchers in Milwaukee and Cleveland and
privately subsidized vouchers in Dayton, New York City, and Washington.88
The wide variety of choice options implies that the incentives under each can be quite different.
For example, the impact of a plan permitting students to choose any public school in the district would have
very different incentives depending on how any excess demand for a school is dealt with, what happens to
teachers and administrators in schools with large number of vacancies, how transportation of students is
handled, and the like. Similarly, when students are permitted to attend public schools outside of the district,
issues about fiscal transfers, the handling of excess demand, and transportation become critical. For
voucher plans, the size of the voucher, the eligibility of potential schools, the treatment of excess demand,
the range of programs that are permissible, the legitimate grounds that schools can use to select students,
and more will determine the character and results of the program. A variety of underlying theoretical
models have identified specific elements of importance. For example, Manski (1992) concentrates on the

87

Charter schools provide provisions for individual schools to opt out of district regulations and to provide
an alternative program. The rules governing these schools vary widely by state, but the common element is that they
are supported by public funds and remain officially part of the public school system. These schools must attract
students who choose them over the regular public schools. While most states have less than one percent of their
students in charter schools in 2000, some such as Arizona (3.7 percent) and Michigan (2.8 percent) have developed
substantial competitive public sector. The District of Columbia has over 8 percent in charters. The start of this
expansion along with a description of the kinds of schools in the charter sector is described in Finn, Manno, and
Vanourek (2000)).
88

Note that privately provided scholarship plans for attending private schools are actually much more
extensive, but the individual plans generally have been small and have not been evaluated.
76

role of peers under different choice plans, while Chubb and Moe (1990) emphasize school decision making.
Little empirical work has been done on identifying or assessing the key elements of choice plans.
The existing public school choice plans have not received thorough analysis in terms of student
outcomes. A primary deterrent to analysis is disentangling selection from program effects. The issues are
identical to those sketch for understanding the impact of Catholic schools, but the development of suitable
instruments for the selection equation is much more problematic. One exception is an analysis of open
enrollment plans in Chicago public schools that suggests most observed better performance by choice
students comes from selection (Cullen, Jacob, and Levitt (2000)).
The voucher programs are different. The most thorough analysis of the voucher programs has
occurred in Milwaukee. This publicly supported voucher, while not an experiment but instead an on-going
program, had an evaluation plan set up at the outset (Witte (1999)). Subsequently, a number of studies,
taking different approaches and reaching somewhat different conclusions, have looked at the same impact
of vouchers in Milwaukee (Peterson, Greene, and Noyes (1996); Greene, Peterson, and Du (1998); Rouse
(1998); Witte (1999)).
Three issues are important in the analysis: how to define outcomes, how long to wait to observe
results, and what the comparison group of students should be. In terms of the outcomes of choice, the
available analyses from the Milwaukee program suggest that parents choosing voucher schools are happier
with them than with the public schools and that the choice schools generally spend noticeably less than the
public schools. Thus, from a simple consumer viewpoint, the vouchers seem useful. Nonetheless, the
majority of attention has focused on measured student achievement. The analyses of student achievement
show no real gains in vouchers schools during the first years, but by the fourth year of operation voucher
schools are doing as well as or better than the Milwaukee public schools, depending upon the precise
performance measure. The findings on achievement also depend upon the precise comparison groups.
Comparisons to people applying but not enrolling in the voucher program or to the low income eligible

77

population show the voucher schools on the whole as doing better, while comparisons to the entire public
student population in Milwaukee show less gain.
The Milwaukee program is one specific set of rules and institutions. It is not a general test of
vouchers versus public schools. At its inception in 1990, participating schools had to be already existing
nonsectarian schools that also served a substantial unsubsidized population (Witte (1999)). Participating
students had to come from low income families.89 The number of participants was initially restricted to less
than 1 percent of the public school population but grew to 15 percent by 1995. Therefore, this experiment
does not represent a general test of vouchers, but instead a very specific kind of application of the ideas.
For example, an important element of the original Friedman (1962) proposals is the induced supply
response which engages markets in innovating in ways that appeal to consumers – something that is really
not a part of the Milwaukee experience.
The voluntary, privately-funded voucher programs offer a separate view of the impact of vouchers.
While these have only been operating for short periods of time, some preliminary results are available.
Peterson et al. (forthcoming) suggest that these programs have had positive effects for some minority
students but not for others. The variations in effectiveness thus leave open many questions that are central
to many of the policy discussions.
The short run evaluations of performance in voucher programs, while interesting and useful,
necessarily provide a limited picture. The primary arguments for introducing competition involve
incentives for new private schools to develop and incentives for the public schools to improve. These are,
however, long run effects, making the evaluation problems and perspectives on these programs analogous to
evaluating merit pay plans for teachers.90

89

Family incomes had to be less than 175 percent of the federal poverty level. The official poverty line for a
family of four was approximately $17,500 in 1990.
90

Note, however, that Hoxby (forthcoming) provides early results that suggest public schools respond
quickly when they face direct competitive pressures.
78

Throughout most of the discussion, very little mention is made of costs. As operated, the existing
voucher programs, including that in Milwaukee, appear to be running at noticeably lower expenditure than
the comparable Milwaukee public school system. Part of this is easily explicable by the public schools’
responsibility for taking all students, including high needs students such as those with handicapping
conditions. But part also seems to be simple differences in cost structures. It is important to know f the
voucher programs are truly operating at lower costs while producing the same (or better results).

International evidence
Other countries have of course operated much broader choice systems than found in the United
States. While it is possible to find descriptive information and information about the flows of students, little
is available about the relative performance of private schools under different institutional structures (see, for
example, James (1987, 1993); Glenn (1989); West (1996); Cohn (1997), and the case studies in it; Fiske
and Ladd (2000); and Jimenez and Sawada (2001)). Again, as with the analysis of production functions,
developing information about the performance has been hindered by measures of student outcomes.
Nonetheless, evidence on choice is beginning to develop, including McEwan and Carnoy (2000) and
McEwan (forthcoming) on the Chilean experience, and Angrist et al. (2001) on Columbia.
International evidence currently offers the best chances for understanding the impacts of voucher
systems, particularly the longer run implications. Not only is choice better established in many countries
than in the U.S. but also the institutional structure for choice shows much more variation.

Financing of Schools
State governments in the United States have had the primary responsibility of the provision of
schooling. The federal government has provided between 5-7 percent of the total funding for schools, and
this funding has been focused on special populations – with economically disadvantaged and handicapped
79

students receiving the bulk of the funding.91 The federal government has also promulgated laws with major
effect on schools. The most important are Constitutional prohibitions against segregation of schools and
federal legislation about service requirements and standards for handicapped students (so called “special
education”). Because of the limited role of the federal government, however, this discussion will
concentrate on state and local spending.
State constitutions invariably identify the role of the state government in establishing and running a
public school system that is free to all students. While the exact arrangements differ, state governments
have historically set the general operating structure for schools in terms of regulations and laws governing
the schools and then given local jurisdictions the responsibility for running the schools. Although there is
wide variation across states, local governments typically share funding responsibilities with the states. The
determination of funding levels is the complicated outcome of local decisions, voter and political outcomes,
and state rules and regulations.
Perhaps the principal policy lever of the states has been the funding level for local education. States
have provided grants to local school districts to cover special purpose, or categorical, items, but most
spending goes for general operating expenditure. The decisions facing state legislatures concern both the
level and the distribution of spending. All states use their funding mechanisms to offset different abilities of
school districts to raise funds locally. Particularly as the value of high quality education has become more
apparent, states have turned their funding toward the goal of improving student achievement. The problem
facing the legislatures has been an inability to turn funding into student achievement with any assurance –
the general issue discussed earlier. One result has been an increasing tendency to add further regulations on
activities along with further funding. This discussion, however, concentrates on the funding aspect and the
implications of state fiscal federalism.

91

Funding for primary and secondary schooling (and higher education) comes through the U.S. Department
of Education. Funding for Head Start, another large education-related program for disadvantaged 4-5 year olds, has
come through the Department of Health and Human Services and generally is not included in the usual accounting of
total spending for education.
80

The discussion of state funding is heavily influenced by legal cases. School finance in the United
States was relatively stable through much of the 20th century. Early developments emphasized the role of
states in ameliorating the largest differences in local wealth (Strayer and Haig (1923)). In the late 1960s,
the case of Serrano v. Priest was entered into California state courts and changed the stability in financing.92
This case alleged that the state funding of schools violated the 14th amendment of the U.S. constitution that
requires equal treatment of individuals under the law. The state funding provided a portion of the funds
needed by local districts, and districts were expected to raise the remainder. California like a majority of
other states permitted local jurisdictions to use the property tax as its major revenue source. The Serrano
suit argued that, because local property tax bases differ, this funding arrangement discriminated against
students in poor districts by making the funding dependent upon the wealth of others in the community
(Coons, Clune, and Sugarman (1970)). While the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled in 1973 that the
state funding formula did not violate the federal constitution,93 the Serrano case and similar subsequent
ones in a majority of the states were argued on the grounds that the method of funding violated the
individual state constitutions. While court cases in states continue, few general conclusions can be drawn
about the legal decisions that have variously upheld and struck down existing state funding formulae.
Similar policy dilemmas face the courts in school finance cases as face the state legislatures that are
formally charged with funding decisions. The courts have entered into education decision making in
deciding on suits brought by people who argue that their districts are receiving insufficient state funding.
While frequently motivated by concerns about student achievement, in reality both the judicial statement of
the issue and the proposed remedies invariably revolve around the level and distribution of resources.
An important issue in these discussions is the effect of financing on student outcomes. While
explicitly considered below, the prior discussions on the limited evidence about any consistent relationship

between resources and student performance should provide an early note of caution about the potential
results of resource based policy decisions.

Alternative funding schemes
With a few exceptions, states and local school districts share the financing of local schools. This
sharing, however, varies in several important dimensions. State financing is frequently characterized in
terms of a formula of identifying state funding per pupil in relationship to local capacity, local effort, and
characteristics of the local student body. The details, the methods of describing the allocation mechanisms,
and even the nomenclature differ across states. Nonetheless, three basic funding mechanisms characterize
the options – and most states use a combination of them. Categorical aid funds districts based upon specific
identified needs; foundation aid compensates for different tax capacity of the local district; and variable
matching aid adjusts state support for both different tax capacity and the taxing decisions of the local
district.
To understand the funds available to a district, it is easiest to ignore federal subsidies and to
concentrate on the state and local funding. For simplicity the funding formulae are written in terms of a
property tax base, reflecting the fact that tax on real property is the most frequently employed local revenue
raising instrument. With number of students Nj, tax base per student Bj , and local tax rate r, school district
j can raise Lj in local funds:

(7)

Lj = Nj × rBj

Districts with larger tax bases clearly can raise funds more easily if they choose to increase
revenues. Note, however, that the tax base is actually endogenous. Because the tax base includes not only
residential property but also commercial and industrial property, local residents in districts with a smaller

82

proportion of the tax base from residential property pay less of the total local tax bill. In other words, the
“tax price” of raising an extra dollar of local revenue is less than one dollar for the residents (Ladd (1975)).
Other things being equal, then, districts with a low tax price are more attractive, and demand for housing in
them will be high – leading to housing prices being bid up and to the tax base being larger (Oates (1969)).
This endogeneity obviously also enters into policy actions. For example, if the state prohibited local
districts from taxing certain kinds of commercial property, some districts would lose two ways: B, the tax
base, would fall with the loss of the commercial property from its tax base and the district would likely
become relatively less attractive so that housing values fell, bringing B down further.
State governments routinely act to ameliorate the largest disparities in revenue abilities of districts
and to even out cost differences across districts. The simplest kinds of state subsidy formulae provide fixed
payments for categorical purposes such as:

(8)

Cj=c × Nj

Where the subsidy from the central authority (state) to district j is a flat amount, c, times the number of
eligible students (N). Thus, for example, the state might provide a flat amount for each student classified as
gifted or talented. Categorical aid is identified with specific purposes and often requires specific
expenditures.94 Categorical aid flows for a variety of purposes including student transportation, books and
supplies, special education, and bilingual education programs. Districts, however, cannot be assumed to be
impervious of incentives. As described below, there is evidence that the number of “categorical” students is
endogenous, related to the fiscal incentives that are presented.95

94

Of course, as is generally true, funds are fungible – implying that requirements to spend categorical funds
would not be binding unless the local education authority wished to spend less than c per eligiblestudent. Some
evidence, however, suggests that this is not the case. Evidence of the “flypaper effect” suggests that funds tend to
stick where they are provided (e.g., see Gramlich (1977)and the discussion in Oates (1994)).
95

Another element of categorical programs is identifying and adjusting for program costs. For example,
83

Most attention, however, has focused on alternative ways of providing general revenue – revenue
with few specific use restrictions. By far the most common aid formula is foundation aid where the state
subsidy varies inversely with the local property tax base per student such as:

(9)

Cj = Nj × (F – roBj)

F is the “foundation,” or the amount the district would get per student if it had no ability to tax itself, ro is
the fixed tax rate used to calculate what the local district might be expected to raise itself. Because local
revenue capacity rises with the taxable base (equation 7), states typically reduce their subsidy for districts
with higher B.
Several aspects of foundation aid are important, although to varying degrees across different states.
First, the foundation aid formula can clearly lead to negative subsidies for districts with large tax bases, i.e.,
when roBj>F. States have generally had mixed reactions to whether or not they should recapture any excess
funds that a district may be able to raise. Without recapture, districts with large amounts of property wealth
continue to have more revenue raising opportunities than those with lower tax bases.
Second, if a district chooses a tax rate, rj, that is greater than ro, state subsidies are unaffected and
jurisdictions with larger tax bases can capture the full benefit of their tax base.96 Total education spending
(Ej) under a foundation plan combines local and state funding as in:

special education funding is frequently adjusted for different handicapping conditions of students. Existing estimates
of costs that are built into many funding formula begin with the expenditure choices of schools, making them
somewhat problematic. See Chaikind, Danielson, and Brauen (1993)and Lankford and Wyckoff (1996). Other
attempts to deal with local cost differences involve both choices of what costs are important and estimation of the
their magnitude – but this again is difficult when based largely on the choices of districts which also involve varying
preferences about teacher quality (Ballou and Podgursky (1997)).
96

Many states require that the district levy some minimum tax rate, often ro, as a way of ensuring that
districts bear a minimum portion of the total taxes for schools. Some states also cap the tax rate that local
jurisdictions can apply (rj) in an effort to limit variations in local spending.
84

(10)

Ej = Lj + C j

= Nj × [(F) + (rj – ro)Bj ]

The incentive to raise the local tax rate of course depends on the desired spending of the community. Thus,
as the foundation level – that “guaranteed” by the state formula – increases, local communities have less
incentive to spend more than F per student and tend to choose tax rates closer to the nominal rate of the
state, ro.
Third, the number of students is frequently adjusted to take into account special factors. For
example, special education students, instead of being paid simple categorical funds as in (eq. 8), may be
credited as if they are additional effective students. Therefore, for example, a disabled student who has an
identified learning disability may count as, say, 1.6 students. In such a case, the state subsidy for categorical
aid depends upon the local tax capacity. But, of course, this also raises the possibility that Nj is really
endogenous to the extent that districts can vary populations. For example, Cullen (forthcoming) shows that
school districts adjust the numbers identified as requiring special education according to their fiscal
incentive;97 Cullen and Rivkin (forthcoming) also show that further reactions to the provision of special
education services by family choices of residence are possible.
Finally, a variable matching grant by states takes into account the actual tax choices of the district.
While this formulation comes under many different names (and equivalent ways of writing the formula),
perhaps the simplest is to think of this as a “guaranteed tax base” as in:

(11)

Cj = Nj × rj (Bo - Bj)

where Bo is the tax base that is guaranteed to the district. (Other common descriptions include wealth

97

An important feature of the analysis is separating out the causal impact. In this, Cullen develops a series of
plausible instruments that permit identification of the impact on classification.
85

neutralizing, power equalizing, and percentage equalizing). For any district with an actual tax base less
than the guaranteed base, the state supplements the local tax revenue. Again, a key element is what happens
when Bj>Bo. If recapture is required, the local district sends the excess revenues to the state. In such a
case, the effective revenue schedule for all districts (combining equations 7 and 11) is simply:

(12)

Ej = Nj × rj Bo

and districts differ in spending just to the extent that they choose varying local tax rates. A variant of this
formulation was first popularized by Coons, Clune, and Sugarman (1970) and is the intellectual backdrop to
the original school finance law suits from Serrano v. Priest through recent suits. Again, however, recapture
provisions have generally proved unpopular and are generally only imposed in response to court orders.
An important aspect of the fiscal consideration is that the formulae provide an indication of the
opportunities that face a district. They do not necessarily foretell the distribution of spending outcomes that
will occur, because these require knowing more about the behavioral responses of individuals. The
behavioral responses occur in two primary ways: the choice of districts by individuals and the expression of
preferences within each district.

Fiscal effects of alternative plans
While courts and legislatures have significantly changed the fiscal responsibilities for schools since
the early 1970s, surprisingly little is known about the effects of these alterations. Some efforts have been
made to track the spending patterns of these changes, but less attention has gone to consideration of the
overall level.
Wyckoff (1992) traces the within-state variations in spending over a substantial period of change.
By calculating alternative measures of spending variations, he concludes that state court action has tended to

86

lead to some narrowing in spending variations, but this is not uniform.98 In a comprehensive study of
existing court and legislative actions, Murray, Evans, and Schwab (1998) estimate models of spending
variation which incorporate information about the timing of court actions. They also conclude that court
action has led to significant narrowing of the spending distribution. However, the state court actions
directly consider just variations within states, while they find that the most significant narrowing of the
spending distribution has been between states.
The exact nature of the changes in the distribution has been the focus of a number of different
analyses. In an early analysis, Stern (1973) focuses on how changes in the financing formula would affect
equalization of funding within Massachusetts. His simulations indicate that a variable matching subsidy
would reduce disparities due to fiscal capacity differences of states but not those due to socioeconomic
differences. The key element, understanding the underlying preferences of individuals, was extended by
Feldstein (1975). He specifically considered how wealth neutrality approaches might lead to unexpected
spending outcomes where spending was inversely related to local wealth. Craig and Inman (1982, 1986)
consider spending patterns in light of reforms that involve moving spending responsibilities to lower levels
of government. Their work builds upon an explicit model of decision making at different levels of
government and highlights the importance of the fiscal federal system. They find surprisingly strong
reactions to changes in funding patterns.99
Court rules may have effects on the level of spending in addition to any effects on the distribution.
Most court rulings do not specify how the state should distribute funds, only that an existing funding system
does not meet constitutional requirements. This typically requires that the state legislature alter its approach
to funding. A variety of political economy models could describe the resultant changes. The simplest

98

An early predecessor to the systematic consideration of state funding variations along with discussion of
alternative measures of the distribution of spending is Berne and Stiefel (1984).
99

While not emphasized here, they also demonstrate the importance of institutional structure including how
grants often have surprising effects. For example, because of the “flypaper effect,” tax reductions exhibit different
effects on spending than unconditional grants (cf. Oates (1994)).
87

model recognizes that pure distributional changes dictate a large number of losing districts that find their
state funding being decreased. To offset these changes, political incentives push toward increasing the
overall level of spending at the same time that there is a redistribution of spending. Downes and Shah
(1996) provide some evidence for this effect, although it is relatively small.
One natural interpretation of the results is that there are simply too many different circumstances
and court rulings to imply uniform effects on spending. In fact, Hoxby (2001) pursues exactly the
characterization of alternative plans. By separating the key parameters and assessing how these differ by
states, she is able to estimate the effects of legislative and court actions on overall spending levels.
Following the earlier analyses of behavioral responses to altered incentives, she shows convincingly that the
naïve, no-behavioral-response analysis that accompanies many plan changes is very misleading.

Effect of equalization on equity
If resource availability is not a good index of educational outcomes or if providing for overall
resource levels does not ensure a desired level of performance, the courts face the same dilemma as
legislatures. Simply providing more funding or a different distribution of funding is unlikely to improve
student achievement (even though it does affect the distribution of tax burdens for school financing across
the citizens of a state).
A related issue—one highlighted in some recent school finance court cases—centers on whether
funding for schools is “adequate” (cf. Clune (1994)) The idea of adequacy has been to provide sufficient
funds to ensure some chosen level of achievement for all students in a state.100 Such concepts may have
popular appeal, but they have no policy superiority to traditional district equity arguments when translated
into resource requirements. First, what is adequate is a purely political and economic issue that it likely to

100

An important aspect of the legal and legislative discussions of adequacy is translation into expenditure.
The situation might be very different if equity and adequacy were truly defined in terms of student outcomes, but in
such a situation there would be little way of ensuring any given distribution of performance – making judicial or
legislative mandates generally impossible.
88

change both with the demands of the economy and with political views on appropriate levels of government
support of programs. Second, and more important, the previous conclusion that resources are not a good
index of student performance holds no matter what goals are placed for student achievement or how these
goals are arrived at. Thus, there is no objective method of indicating what resources are required for an
‘adequate’ level of student performance.101
A variation of this general adequacy theme is to argue that, while resources alone may not be
sufficient to guarantee achievement, adequate resources are surely necessary. Undoubtedly, this is an
accurate statement at some level, because a school with no funds would not be expected to add anything to
student achievement. Nonetheless, as shown in Table 5 for the United States, real spending per student rose
dramatically between 1900 and 1995, even though U.S. student performance appears to have been
essentially unchanged. Further, nothing in the previous analytical results about the effects of resources
suggests that there is a level below which resources have clear and powerful effects on achievement—which
would be a demonstration that some schools are below the threshold of ‘necessity.’ Just asserting that there
is some level of necessary expenditure does not make the case for pure resource policies in today’s
schooling environment.
Analyses considering spending variations do not, for the reasons previously described, give direct
information about any effects on student performance. Perhaps surprisingly given the extent of legal actions
during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there has been little direct analysis of performance differences related
to funding equalization. Downes (1992) investigates whether the early alterations in California arising from
the Serrano v. Priest case had any impact on variations in student test performance. He finds no significant
impact on performance when he looked at variations before and after equalization of local spending.
Hanushek and Somers (2001) pursue a different tact. They consider whether variations in spending within
a state are ultimately reflected in earnings variations when the students progress into the labor market. This

101

See, for example, the difficulty in defining adequacy in Ladd and Hansen (1999).
89

analysis, a generalization of that in Card and Krueger (1992a), finds little evidence that earnings variations
correspond to earlier spending variations.102 These findings are consistent with the earlier evidence that
suggested no consistent improvement in student performance from changes in funding.
One of the impacts of court cases has been increased centralization of funding. Particularly during
the 1970s, the average share of funding coming from the state level rose and surpassed the share at the local
level. Centralization of funding itself could have implications for both funding levels and performance. As
funding responsibility moves from the locality to higher levels of government, individuals are more
detached from the taxing and spending decisions and standard free rider problems increase. The arguments
for this position are largely conceptual (e.g., Hoxby (1996a)). The direct empirical analysis typically must
confront the concerns about aggregation bias raised previously when they rely on evidence across states
(e.g., Walberg and Walberg III (1994); Peltzman (1993)). Indirect evidence on reactions to changes over
time, however, provides additional support. Specifically, movements toward more centralization of state
finance have been related to efforts to control overall levels of spending by Fischel (1989), Silva and
Sonstelie (1995), and Courant and Loeb (1997). The argument is that, in reaction to state court decisions to
equalize spending, California voters supported Proposition 13 that placed strict limits on levels of taxes and
spending.103 A similar analysis by Loeb (2001), simulating the effects different financing systems, shows
that the amount of local control of supplementation can have dramatic impacts on the level and distribution
of spending across districts and that these effects are very dependent on the distribution of local
preferences.104

102

The Hanushek and Somers analysis concentrates on the within state variance in funding and the
subsequent variations in earnings of people educated in a given state. Thus, it avoids the largest problems associated
with differences in state policy environments, as discussed previously.
103

Related work on the causes and consequences of tax limitation initiatives have also had a component of
looking at student performance in addition to the more common study of the effects on spending and its composition.
See Figlio (1997) and the discussion there.
104

An innovation in this work is relaxing a common assumption that there is perfect sorting by income,
which allows her to base simulations on the observed wealth distributions of school districts.
90

Mobility, Distribution, and Equilibrium
One very significant problem in considering state financing of schools is that the analysis generally
assumes that districts and their residents are fixed. Additionally, it is often assumed that property wealth –
the common basis for local taxation – is an acceptable index of the economic well-being of a jurisdiction’s
population. These assumptions prove to be very problematic but difficult to deal with in any complete
fashion (Hanushek (1991)).
If the property tax base just incorporated residential property, the tax base would be a reasonable
measure of the economic well-being of the population, but the inclusion of commercial and industrial
property in the tax base breaks this relationship. Thus, for example, some cities have large proportions of
their students in poverty even though they have large tax bases (e.g., New York City) while other cities have
large poverty populations and small tax bases (e.g., Newark, New Jersey). Most of the funding formulae
emphasize the local ability of districts to raise funds, but often incorrectly suggest that this is synonymous
with poverty. Moreover, the tax advantage of having large amounts of commercial and industrial property
in a city will, to the extent that potential tax revenues exceed the costs of providing public services to these
properties, be capitalized into the value of residential properties. Thus, two identical properties located in
jurisdictions with different tax capacities will sell for different amounts.
Additionally, as discussed previously, communities that have good schools will generally be more
desirable than schools with bad schools, and housing prices will be bid up in places with good schools
(Kain and Quigley (1975), Rosen and Fullerton (1977), Black (1999), Weimer and Wolkoff (2001)).105 In
other words, residents in school districts with larger capitalization of school quality are actually paying more
for their schools than is apparent by a simple comparison of tax rates to support schools. This variation in
capitalization also has apparent feedbacks to the quality of schools, since schools in more competitive areas
tend to have more effective schools (Hoxby (2000a), Hanushek and Rivkin (forthcoming)). The overall

105

The capitalization relationships are complicated by variations in the efficiency of schools in producing
91

endogeneity of the tax base is ignored in most considerations of school finance policy – both legislatively
and judicially.
Behind the capitalization of aspects of tax base and schools into housing prices is the choice of
communities and mobility of residents. The high level of mobility in school age population underscores the
levels of potential adjustment to school cost and quality that occurs regularly.106 If thought of in terms of
the different possible margins of adjustment, as in the exit and voice of Hirschman (1970), it also highlights
the equilibrium nature of school finance policy and changes in such policy. Thus, for example, a change in
school funding by a state would set in motion a pattern of changed housing values, altered residential and
school choices, and adjusted spending and performance patterns of schools. The resulting equilibrium
outcomes in terms of the distribution of expenditure and performance patterns across the population are not
easy to project.
Several research programs have addressed various aspects of this general equilibrium problem and
have provide insights into the effects of different fiscal policies. An early and interesting line of work,
although following a different path than here, involves understanding the effects of financing mechanisms
on economic growth (Glomm and Ravikumar (1992, 1998)). This work concentrates on how public and
private schooling interact with economic growth. Their analysis of endogenous growth models suggests a
trade-off between higher per capita incomes with private schools and more equality with public schools. By
explicitly considers voting and public choice mechanisms, they also suggest that voters are likely to choose
public schools.
Fernandez and Rogerson (1996, 1997, 1998)develop calibrated models of schooling and labor
market outcomes that incorporate different jurisdictions. This apparatus allows investigation of different

any quality of outcomes; see Somers (1998).
106

Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2001a) describe school mobility and its effects on achievement.
Interestingly, the detailed consideration of moving causes in the Current Population Survey does not attempt to
investigate whether moving behavior is related to public services or schools; see Schacter (2001a, 2001b). For within
county movers, 26 percent move for family-related reasons, 6 percent for work-related reasons, and 65 percent for
housing-related reasons.
92

financing schemes, and the complete characterization of individuals in the economy permits welfare
comparisons derived from different financing schemes. While the exact welfare comparisons appear
dependent upon the key parameters of their economy, they develop a structure that identifies how individual
behavior responds to changing in financing schemes. A key insight from their work is that it is difficult to
predict the impact of different financing schemes on the level of educational spending from a partial
equilibrium setting. In their models, however, the schooling sector itself is very simple (efficient provision
of public education depending just on spending), making it impossible to trace out implications of policy for
the schooling sector.
Epple and Romano (1996, 1998, forthcoming) develop more detailed models of household location
that interact consumer choices and schooling outcomes. A central element of their analyses is variations in
school quality that depend on peers in the school, leading to an externality from high ability students.
Households of different incomes with children of different abilities seek out communities that maximize
utility. The presence of a private sector supported by vouchers permits the private schools to internalize the
externality of high ability students, but the exact solution depends on the size of the voucher. Epple and
Romano (1998) sets out the basic properties of equilibrium including the key predictions that private
schools will trade off income and ability, private tuitions declining in ability, and a strict hierarchy of
schools. Epple and Romano (forthcoming) turn to the alternative of public school choice and traces out
equilibrium models of neighborhood choice, showing that residential stratification is a likely result that
interacts with tax and expenditure policies.
In a series of papers, Nechyba (1999, 2000, 2001, forthcoming-a, forthcoming-b) develops rich
models of the interplay of residential location, school policies, and segregation. Much of the discussion of
private schools, for example, suggests that segregation of schools is a likely result, but these discussions
ignore the current incentives to segregate in communities. Nechyba (2000) shows that vouchers work in
part to severe the link between residential location and schools. As a result, the pressures to segregate in

93

residential communities are lessened, and vouchers produce less segregation than a pure public school
system. Nechyba (forthcoming-b) introduces private schools in the absence of vouchers, mirroring the
observed U.S. equilibrium, and – even in the absence of vouchers – a private school alternative is shown to
reduce segregation more than a completely centralized (and equalized) system. Nechyba (forthcoming-a)
further explores the interaction of public school efficiency, private schools, and schooling choice, again
showing that the general equilibrium responses differ markedly from simple partial equilibrium predictions.
Each of these approaches necessarily concentrates on some specific issues, while highly simplifying
others. At the same time, each demonstrates vividly that the general equilibrium can differ quite
dramatically from the partial equilibrium results. As more experience is gained in these models, they can
enrich their descriptions of behavior and can provide important insights about central issues in the financing
of schools.

Some Underexplored Topics
While much has been learned about publicly provided education, a variety of important issues
remain underresearched. Most of these are apparent from replaying the prior discussions of what is
currently known. Therefore, this discussion is designed to highlight a few areas rather than to develop the
areas in any depth.
Perhaps at the top of the list is the behavior of consumers in the face of public provision of schools.
If schools are inefficient in their use of public funds, why is consumer and voter behavior so ineffective?
Attention to consumer behavior and to underlying issues of political economy has focused almost
exclusively on issues of the level of spending, ignoring questions of the results of spending.107
Understanding the elements of citizen behavior is important for both positive theories of spending and for
consideration of the feasibility of alternative policy regimes.

107

Exceptions include Somers (1998) and Pritchett and Filmer (1999). Somers considers how school
efficiency and consumer demands interact in determining spending levels and patterns of districts. Pritchett and
Filmer consider how self-interest of school decision makers affects patterns of inefficiency.
94

The incentive structure of schools is the keystone to educational policy, but little headway has been
made in understanding this more generally. Many reform proposals – from expanded consumer choice to
heightened accountability systems – involve direct attempts to change incentives. Nonetheless, existing
research, which has generally relied upon the few natural experiments with different incentives, remains
very rudimentary. The empirical analyses typically relate to very specific programs whose generalizability
is not well understood. The conceptual work is even farther behind, failing in general to develop much of a
vocabulary or taxonomy for incentive schemes and thus leaving open a wide range of important
measurement issues. In a larger political view, current participants clearly have preferences over a variety
of the potential incentive schemes and exert influence on both their adoption and their evolution – and
understanding the political aspects of program development is important. Pressures for changes in
incentives currently being contemplated or implemented, however, open large new areas for research.
As discussed throughout, the analysis has been heavily weighted toward studies of the United States
experience. This slant to research is particularly unfortunate, because international schooling offers a very
wide range of experiences. The variations in organization, funding, and institutions that are found
internationally offer promise for resolving some of the questions that have not been fully addressed within
the more limited U.S. experience.
The analysis of schooling policies generally pays little attention to the array of policies and
influences outside of school: daycare, preschool, after school programs, extracurricular activities, and the
like. These facets of children’s development are typically treated independent of schools in both analytical
and policy discussions, even though they undoubtedly interact with schools and should be considered in a
larger optimizing framework for governmental programs.
