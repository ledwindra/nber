    "abstract": "\n\nCrony capitalism and self-fulfilling expectations by international creditors are often suggested as two rival explanations for currency crisis.  This paper examines a possible linkage between the two that has not been explored much in the literature: corruption may affect a country's composition of capital inflows in a way that makes it more likely to experience a currency crisis that is triggered/aided by a sudden reversal of international capital flows.  We find robust evidence that poor public governance is associated with a higher loan-to-FDI ratio. Such a composition of capital flows has been identified as being associated with a higher incidence of a currency crisis.  We also find some weaker evidence that poor public governance is associated with a country's inability to borrow internationally in its own currency.  The latter is also associated with a higher incidence of a currency crisis.  To sum up, even though crony capitalism does not forecast the timing of a crisis, it can nevertheless increase its likelihood.  This paper illustrates a particular channel through which this can happen.\n\n",
