CHARACTERISTICS OF U.S. MANUFACTURING COMPANIES
INVESTING ABROAD AND THEIR CHOICE OF PRODUCTION LOCATIONS

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relations among characteristics of U.S. firms, their tendency to invest abroad, and their choice
of production locations. The larger the firm, and the higher its profitabi—
lity, capital Intensity, technological Intensity, and the skill level of
its labor force, the higher the probability that it was a foreign investor.
Some of these factors were largely associated with the industry the firm
was in but size, R&D, and profitability were characteristics of investing
firms within individual industries.
Despite its importance in determining the probability that a firm
would invest abroad, size of firm appeared to have no relation to the
importance of foreign investment; among firms that invested at all, large
firms did not produce a higher proportion of their output abroad than small
firms. The concentration of manufacturing abroad in a small number of cornpanies Is largely a reflection of the concentration within the United
States. The influence of size, we conclude, reflects economies of scale
not In production but in investing.
We found no evidence that, in general, low—wage U.S. firms tended to
invest in low—wage countries or that R&D—intensive firms tended to operate
more in countries with highly sophisticated or educated labor. In fact,
investors in developing countries, and particularly those in some Southeast
Asian countries, tended to be more R&D intensive than investors in developed countries. There was some indication that in industries other than
machinery R&D—intensive firms were more inclined than others to license
technology, while in the machinery industries, R&D—intensive firms tended
to license less:
to exploit their technological capital In foreign markets
by producing there rather than by licensing.

Introduction
One common thread that runs through most explanations of the role of
multinational firms is that their distinctive characteristic is possession

of some technological advantage over other firms. This could be the
possession of a patented or difficult to imitate process or product but it
might also be knowledge about production or marketing or servicing a

complex product. It could be a particular quality of product or its
suitability in particular uses or the firm's ability to assist buyers in

using the product or to persuade buyers to purchase the product. The
advantage is usually difficult to identify and measure, because it rarely
takes the form simply of measurably higher output for the same amount of

identifiable inputs. The difficulty of demonstrating the existence of or
measuring the extent of this mysterious factor of production, which we can
broadly identify as "technology," is one reason why It tends to be
exchanged

in internal markets——that is, within a firm——rather than traded

among firms. By the same token, this difficulty of measurement makes it
hard to learn whether technological advantages are the basis for direct
investment or to know what results would flow from limitations on
investment.

Who Invests Abroad?

A parent firm's distinctive characteristics are presumably what enable
it to produce in a host country in competition with local firms that may
have advantages of being at home:

the favor of the government, knowledge

of the language and customs of the country, consumer goodwill, and so on.
The attributes of the multinational firm are composed of several elements:

those associated with the country that is the home base of the firm, those
associated with the industry, and those specific to the firm (Kravis and

Lipsey, 1982). The home country attributes must be those that are absorbed
by the company, embodied in mobile factors of production, such as the
management or scientific or marketing staff, and carried over to production

abroad. The industry attributes are those common to firms in an industry
regardless of national origin, and the firm attributes are those that
distinguish the company from others in its own country and industry, such

as leadership in innovation or in quality of product. The same
characteristics may appear in each category; for example, a high level of

R&D is a characteristic of U.S. firms in general, as compared to those from
other countries, but firms in the pharmaceutical industry have high levels
of R&D relative to those in other industries in the United States and in
other countries, and some firms within each country's pharmaceutical
industry have much higher levels of R&D investment than the industry
ave rage.

In this paper we deal mainly with what we describe as industry and

firm characteristics. There may be some country characteristics mixed in,
but we cannot distinguish them in a study relying on one country's data.

—3—
We do point out some similarities to, and differences from, Swedish
investors, the only other national group studied extensively. Even with
respect to Sweden and the United States, however, there has not yet been a
careful comparative study.

The accepted notion of what characteristics distinguish multinational
parent firms from others, as summarized in Hufbauer's (1975) survey, is
that they are a mixture of technological—rent and

industrial—organization

factors, not completely independent of each other. Multinational firms are
set apart from others by, among other

characteristics, their large size,

high profitability, and heavy expenditures on R&D and advertising.
Hufbauer quotes Horst (1972) as having established that within industries
only size distinguishes multinational firms from others in their

industries, at least among U.S.—based firms. The implication is that all
the other characteristics are industry attributes. Thus size of firm is a
rival to technological characteristics as an explanation of foreign

investment decisions among parents within an industry.
Comparing the attributes of investing firms with those of other fIrms
is a more complex problem than might appear at first glance. While we know

a good deal about U.S. firms investing abroad, from the direct investment
surveys of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. Department of

Commerce,

1975 and 1981), there are no comparable data, using the same Industry

classifications,

parent firm definitions, and firm attributes, for

noninvestors. Data sources with information for large numbers of
individual firms that include both investors and noninvestors, such as

Moody's Industrials or the Standard and Poor's Compustat tapes, do not

—4--

identify all foreign direct investors arid do not distinguish between

domestic and foreign activities of individual firms. We use both of these
sources of data to characterize firms we identify as investors or
noninvestors.

In Table 1, we compare U.S. parents of majority—owned manufacturing
affiliates with their industries with respect to several measures of R&D
intensity and average compensation (which we take in comparisons within the

U.S. to be a measure of average skill level of the labor force). The
parent data refer to the consolidated domestic operations of manufacturing

industry parents of affiliates in all industries. For comparability, we
restricted our industry data to those which excluded foreign operations,

although this limited the kinds of comparisons we could make. We were
unable, for example, to include any industry profitability measures because

these included profits from foreign operations. It was not possible to
obtain comparability between parent and industry data in industry

classification, unfortunately. The parent data are classified by major
industry of the enterprise, as are the industry data in the section of the

table referring to R&D expenditures and personnel. The industry data in
the section on employee compensation are classified by establishment. They
thus more accurately represent industry characteristics but are less
comparable to the parent data.

A comparison of the absolute numbers reported by the various sources
points up some of the difficulties in this comparison. One is that the
investors made up a large part of the universe of manufacturing
enterprises, 84.4 per cent of employment and 87.6 per cent of the R&D

scientists and engineers. The characteristics of parents could not,
therefore, diverge much from those of enterprises in their industries.

Parents accounted for a much smaller share of manufacturing establishment
employment——only 60 per cent. If comparability were perfect we could
subtract

to

the parent values from those for enterprises in their industries

obtain estimates for noninvestors, and we did make such a calculation

for total manufacturing. However, it is clear that at least for the
industry groups there are differences in classification or measurement,
since parent numbers exceed the industry numbers in three of the six
industries.

We

measured skill intensity by levels

of employee compensation,

assuming that the more skilled workers command higher salaries. In every
industry but

food

products, the parent companies paid higher than average

levels of total compensation per employee. Average payroll per production
worker (total compensation was not available) shows the parent companies

higher in all but two industries: food products, again, and chemicals.
The magnitude of the difference in compensation per employee between parent
and industry for total manufacturing is larger than that for any individual

industry. This would suggest that the difference results not only from
individual industry differences, but also from a different industry mix——
the parent firms must have been concentrated in higher paying industries,

as well as paying above average wages for their industry. Thus the
multinational firms appear to be relatively skill—intensive within
relatively skill—intensive industries.

We cannot, on the other hand, draw any strong conclusions from these

—8—

data

about the R&D intensity of the multinationals. One gets the general

impression that the parents were, overall, slightly more R&D intensive, and
they appeared more R&D intensive in twice as many comparisons as they

appeared less so. However, the ratios are often extremely close, or equal
to each other. Among the four measures in Table 1 there is none that
points consistently one way or the other. For only three industries is
there any general agreement among them: in both the metal manufactures and
nonelectrical machinery industries, the parents' R&D levels were higher

than average, while in the chemical industry, they were lower. For the
rest of the industries, as well for total manufactures, the parents' R&D

intensity was very similar to that of their industries. One would have to
conclude from this set of data, for most industries, and for manufacturing
in general, that there were no major differences between multinational
parents and their industries in R&D intensity.

Calculations for noninvestors, that is industry minus parents, were
performed only for total manufacturing, because we did not think the

industry classifications were comparable. They show consistently that
parents were higher—wage companies and, by three measures Out of four, more

research—intensive as well. The lack of any difference for the rate of
total R&D expenditures to sales may reflect the fact that there were some
very R&D—intensive industries with major government financing of R&D, such

as aircraft and missiles, that invest very little abroad. We cannot say
whether these differences in R&D intensity are to be attributed to intra—
industry

differences or to industry mix. There are also some differences

in definition between the parent

and industry definitions of R&D

—9—
expenditures, the importance of which we do not know. One of these is the
inclusion in the parent data of company—financed R&D performed outside the
company.

Another measure sometimes used as a proxy for skill levels of the

labor force is the proportion of nonproduction workers. The data showed
the parent companies to have had much higher levels than their industries—--

almost 50 per cent higher for manufacturing as a whole and over 50 per cent

in some industries. However, we did not consider this difference
believable for two reasons. One was that parents were such a large part of
their industries that the ratios would have to be close if they were

measured properly. The other was that the data showed parents having much
higher proportions of nonproduction workers even in industries in which
parents' average compensation levels were lower.

Another way of studying the characteristics of investing firms is by
using information on individual companies from standard sources of company
financial data within which we attempted to distinguish foreign direct

investors. One advantage over the calculations of Table 1 is that the
characteristics for investors and noninvestors are from the same source and

are therefore comparable. Another is that the companies can be compared
with their industries at the 4—digit SIC level rather than at the very

broad industry groups of Table 1. The comparison with the more detailed
industries should tend to raise the importance of industry differences and
reduce the influence of company divergences from their industries.

The comparisons of firms with their industries are done in two ways.
For most items, the industry measures, referred to as enterprise data, are

— 10 -

from the same sources as the firm data and are unweighted averages of the
measures for the firms in the sample. For a few items, referred to as
establishment data, the industry measures are calculated separately for
each firm by weighting industry characteristics derived from the Census of
Manufactures by the proportion of the firm's domestic (TJ.s.) employment

that is in each industry. These are thus measures of the characteristics
each firm would have shown if in each industry in which it operated it was

exactly like the average firm. The establishment data are better than our
enterprise data in two respects. One is that they apply only to
establishments in the industry, rather than to all establishments, whatever

their industry, of every firm classified in that industry. The second is
that the individual firms are assigned the attributes of all the industries
in which they operate rather than only those of the principal industry for
each firm.

The data suffer from a number of disadvantages. One is that we can
only characterize firms here by the attributes of their worldwide
operations, assuming for this purpose that these attributes determined

investment decisions and were not simply a reflection of them. Thus an
investing firm paying high wages in the United States may appear here as
one paying lower wages in the aggregate if foreign operations in low—wage

countries were important in the total. However, since the bulk of foreign
operations were in comparatively high wage countries and since they were
not a very large part of total employment for most companies, although they
were for some, we suspect that the inclusion of foreign operations does not
produce very different results from those we would have arrived at from an

— 11 —

analysis

in which characterizations of firms

were based on domestic (u.s.)

attributes.
Another drawback of these data is that to avoid incomparabilities in
definitions of characteristics between firms and their industries we do not
calculate differences between firms and industries or ratios of firms to
industries using the establishment—based industry characteristics, but only

using "industry" averages for the firms in our data set. Since the firms
usually cover several industries, these "industry" averages may tend to
blur the distinctions among more precisely defined industries such as could

be calculated from establishment data. For that reason we do show a few
establishment—based industry characteristics of firms for comparison. As
was pointed out in connection with Table 1, the investors tended to

dominate most of the industries. That problem is exacerbated in the
company data by the incompleteness of the sample, which probably omits more

small noninvesting firms than investors. The industry averages are thus
biased to resemble the larger firms.

Table 2 compares U.S. firms that invest abroad with those that did not

have any such operations, not even sales subsidiaries. Columns (1) and (2)
compare the two sets of firms directly, without regard to their industry

affiliation. In columns (3) and (4) we compare the industry
characteristics of the two groups by attributing to each firm the average

characteristics of the industry or industries to which it belonged. In
effect this comparison assumes that there are such things as attributes
that are common to firms in an industry regardless of their foreign

investment or other individual characteristics. The industry

company data for manufacturing firms, mainly based

publicly available financial information, were matched with our

listing of investors and noninvestors, as identified for a period

around 1971—72, and with our tabulation of the industry distribution
o1 company employment in the United States. For a description of the
data sets see Lipsey (1978).
Numbers of observations range from 204 for Compensation per
employee

and 650—770 for R&D intensity, Noncomperisation VA per
employee, and Rate of growth of employment to 900—1,000 for the other
var I a hi. e s.

Col. (3) and (4): Enterprise data (Rows 1—9, 11—14, and 17) are derived
from our own data and therefore include information only for those
companies that were included in that set. Each firm is therefore
assigned the characteristics of the average of all the firms in the
same 4—digit SIC industry in our data set rather than the characteristics of the industry as a whole. For this purpose, each firm is
included only in its principal industry.
The establishment data (Rows 10, 15, 16, and 18) take advantage
of the information for whole industries collected on an establishment
basis for the Census of Manufactures and similar surveys. For each
firm, the attributes of its industries are weighted up by the
employment distribution for the firm. Thus, the figure for
Scientists and engineers/Employment shows the ratio each firm would
have had if in each of the industries in which it operated it used
the same proportion as the average for the industry.
Numbers of observations are as in Col. (1) and (2) for
enterprise data and over 1,250 for establishment data.

characteristics

are calculated in two ways, from enterprise data and from

establishment data, as explained above, and we consider the latter more

reliable. Unfortunately, they are also more difficult to compare directly
with the data for firms in columns (1) and (2), because they are from
different sources, and we therefore do not make direct comparisons.

In

columns (5) through (8) we compare each firm to its own industry, using

only the industry data on an enterprise basis. We do not directly compare
investors with noninvestors since the industries may be quite different.

Among the variables related to the technology of firms the most direct

measures of input into technology are those of R&D intensity. They show
that investors spent more heavily than did noninvestors. The differences
in R&D

input shown here are much larger than those in Table

variable we take to represent an aspect of

capital

1.

Another

technology is the physical

intensity of production, as measured by various ratios of nonhuman

capital input to employment. The investors were more capital intensive, by
every measure. A counterpart to the nonhuman capital intensity is the
human capital or skill intensity. We have, on the firm level, only average
compensation per employee as a measure, and even that is poorly covered in

the sample. The noninvestors appear to have been higher—wage, presumably
higher-skill, firms. Since the total compensation figures are based on
only about a fifth of the firms and since the data in Table 1 point to the
opposite result——that investors paid high—compensation per worker——we have
to describe the issue of skill levels as not settled.

Investors were more profitable than noninvestors, and by a large

margin. This is a variable that is difficult to classify with respect to

— 15 —

its

relation to technological factors. It could represent the exercise of

market power derived from size, rather than from technological leadership.

On the other hand, it could represent higher than normal profits, true
rents, on technological investment, in which case it would be a
technological output measure, reflecting the success of R&D investment.
Rates of growth, another possible reflection of technological success,

but also of many other factors, differed little between investors and
noninvestors except in the case of employment growth.
The largest difference between investors and noninvestors was in size,

which can be, as we said earlier, an alternative to technological factors

as an explanation of investment. The investors were, on the average, six
to nine times as large as the noninvestors by the three size measures.'- As
in the case of profitability, there is some ambiguity about the reason for

the relationship. The size of investors may reflect economies of scale in
investing, as Caves suggests.2 Large size may open up the possibility of
economies achieved by splitting up a product line or stages of production
into

parts suitable for different economic envIronments, as In the division

between wafer production in developed countries and assembly in developing

countries

by semiconductor companies. It might, on the other hand,

represent mainly the market power of the large investor, or its desire to
exercise that power more effectively in foreign countries.

These differences between investors and noninvestors may reflect
simply the industry composition of the two groups or, on the other hand,
differences between investing or noninvesting firms and their industries.

We try in various ways to make that distinction in Columns 3 through 8 of

— 16 —

of

Table 2.

The large differences in R&D intensity between investors and
noninvestors are mirrored in the four measures for the industries of the

two groups. That is, the investors were clearly from more R&D—intensive

industries. The two measures for which we have firm as well as industry
data suggest that about half of the difference was associated with the
industry composition and about half with firm

differences

from their

industries, with perhaps some indication that the latter source of
differences was larger.

The technology input measure that shows the largest difference between
investors and noninvestors that is associated with industry composition is

the ratio of total scientists and engineers to total employment. This may
measure not R&D input but the technological complexity of the industry or
the pace of technical change, which determines the manpower required for

imitation. Unfortunately we do not have a corresponding measure for
individual firms.3
We find that investors were more physically capital intensive than

non.investors but in this case the bulk of the difference reflects the

industry composition of the two groups. Relative to their industries the
noninvestors were slightly (4—8 per cent) less capital intensive.

The surprising higher compensation per worker we found for nonin—

vesting firms turns out to be entirely an industry characteristic. There
was no difference between the two groups relative to their industries.
However, the two industry measures of compensation per worker disagree.

The enterprise measure, more comprehensive in the types of compensation

— 17 —

covered, says that it is the lower—skill industries that tended more to
invest abroad. The establishment measure, covering only wages and salaries
per worker but not other forms of compensation, but based on observations
for many more firms, suggests that the investors came from industries of
slightly higher skill levels.4

The higher profitability of investing firms, while it partly reflects
the fact that they came from more profitable industries, mainly reflects

the characteristics of the individual firms. That is, the investors were

more profitable than the average firms in their industries. On the other
hand, the higher rates of growth in employment of investing firms were
largely an industry characteristic.

Size is partly an industry variable. The investors were from
industries in which average firm size was high.5 In addition, investors
were, within their industries, about twice as large as noninvestors.6

The industry differences in average size of firm could reflect the
extent of scale economies in production, a characteristic of the

Industries' technologies. However, the presence of scale economies in
production is usually considered an obstacle to production abroad. In the
case of Swedish foreign investors, scale economies, as an industry
variable, were negatively related to foreign investment propensities
(Swedenborg, 1979, pp. 128—130).

Since most large firms had some foreign activity, either manufacturing
or marketing, it is of interest to look at the characteristics of those

that did not. Of the 2,300 manufacturing firms in our company data, only a
little over ten per cent had no foreign subsidiaries. The proportions

— 18 —

differ

greatly among the industries, ranging from 0 to over a quarter among

two—digit SIC classes (Table 3).

The industries in which the United States does not enjoy a comparative
advantage in trade and that have had severe problems with import competition,

such as leather and products, apparel, primary metals, and transportation
equipment were also the ones with the highest proportions of noninvestors.

The industries that had very few firms that did not invest abroad, such as
instruments, chemicals, and nonelectrical machinery, were those in which

the U.S. comparative advantage is concentrated. The industries with the

— 19 —

highest

skill levels and R&D intensity were also concentrated at the bottom

of the list with very few noninvesting firms, while the low—skill and low
R&D—intensity industries were mostly among those with higher numbers of

noninvestors. There is no clear relationship to physical capital intensity. Chemicals and petroleum refining were in the group in which almost
all firms invested abroad, but primary metals, also physical—capital inten-

sive, had a high proportion of noninvestors. Leather and products and
apparel, both labor—intensive, had many noninvestors, but machinery, also
fairly labor-intensive, had very few.

One industry characteristic we thought might distinguish firms likely
to invest abroad was the cost of transporting the product, conceived
broadly to include any factors that required production close to consumers.

An industry in which U.S. firms possessed the technological advantages
needed to sell abroad hut in which exporting was difficult because the
product was bulky or needed extensive attention at the consumption location

would be likely to produce extensively abroad. We attempted to measure the
difficulty of long—distance marketing from data on the U.S. market, hoping
that it would be associated with industries in which establishments shipped

their product relativey short distances. The logic of the hypothesis
requires a division between firms with and without foreign manufacturing
rather than those with and without any foreign subsidiaries, but we did not

have the manufacturing information. The effect is probably to blur our
results since firms which centralize production and only export from the

United States may nevertheless establish foreign sales affiliates and
therefore appear in our data as foreign investors.

The data give no confirmation at all to the role of this variable.

The investors shipped over a longer distance on the average, rather than a

shorter one, by both measures. Unless the results are dominated by the
operations of trading subsidiaries, we can drop this variable from

consideration

as an important determinant of investment.

Foreign investment has also been associated with the degree of
concentration

in an industry. We can test that relationship in our data by

comparing the average concentration ratios among the industries of the two

groups of firms. The differences are not large but they are consistent

from one measure to another. The investing firms were from industries with
higher levels of concentration than those of the noninvesting firms, as has
been

suspected.

All these analyses up to this point of the probability that a firm
would be a foreign investor have been univariate. They have ignored the
possibility that the apparent influence of one variable may

reflect

that of

another correlated with it or the possibility that several variables in

combination explain the probabilities. A way of investigating this issue
is with a multivariate logit analysis in which the dependent variable is
the probability that a firm will be an investor or a multinational firm, or
the per cent of a group of firms that will be investors or multinational
firms,

and the independent variables are the ones listed in Tables 1 and 2.

We can also add industry dummy variables and, for the pharmaceutical

industry, certain measures of a company's innovativeness developed in an

earlier study.
For our own measure of the probability of being any type of foreign

investor, the logit analysis pointed to only one variable, the size of the
firm. Neither the other characteristics of Industries or firms or industry
dummies improved on this variable. Because of the high proportion of
investors by this definition overall and in most industries we thought the
logit equation might not provide a good fit and we experimented with the

much more restrictive definition of a multinational firm used In the
Harvard studies (Vaupel and Curhan, 1973, p. 2), principally that the firm

should have equity interests of 25 per cent or more In manufacturing firms

located in six or more countries outside the United States. This criterion
was met by fewer than 200 firms.

The main variable determining multlnatlonality in this sense was again

— 22 —

size,

but profitability, as measured by the ratio of net income to sales

(and with possible relationships to technology and/or monopolistic power,

as mentioned earlier), was also significant. Some industry dummy variables
were significant, positive for chemicals and foods, negative for primary

metals. The measure distinguishing "innovative" pharmaceutical companies
from others and those purporting to measure the innovativeness of these
companies (Cohen, Katz, and Beck, 1975) did not help to distinguish multinational manufacturing investors from others within that industry.

To summarize, we have strong evidence supporting earlier findings that
size of firm is of great importance in determining the probability that a

firm will invest abroad. Profitability and technological intensity also
seem to encourage foreign investment.

Most of the industry and firm characteristics worked together, as can
be seen in the following table which shows the per cent of differences
between investors and noninvestors that is explained by differences in the
characteristics of the industries they are in:

High skill levels, if they served at all to distinguish investors from
noninvestors, were almost entirely an industry determinant of the
probability of being an investor rather than an influence on the firm's

behavior relative to its industry. The same was true to a smaller extent
of physical capital Intensity. Depending on the size measure used, we find
that 40 to 60 per cent of the difference in size between investors and
noninvestors could be attributed to industry, and the rest to the deviation

of companies from their industry average. While most of the industry and
firm characteristics worked together there was one exception, the rate of

growth of assets, in which they pulled in opposite directions: the

— 24 —

investors

were from slightly slower—growing industries but they were the

faster—growing companies within those industries. However, the differences
involved were too small to deserve much attention. On the other hand, the
investors were from industries growing faster in employment than those of
the nonirivestors and were the faster growing employers in those industries.

The two characteristics for which the behavior of firms relative to
their industries was more important than the behavior of industries were

technological intensity and profitability. In both cases the deviation of
investing firms from their industry averages accounted for about 60 per
cent or more of the overall difference between investor and noninvestor

firms. Thus, aside from industry differences and that of size of firm
within industries, we found, in contrast to earlier studies, two variables

that influence the selection of foreign investors within industries. One
is the extent of input into R&D, which is a technological input, and the
other is profitability, which might reflect input into technology, the
other sources.

One way of attempting to explain the results of our comparisons of
investors and noninvestors is by referring to theories that treat
technology as a changing, rather than a fixed, characteristic of

commodities. Among these are the "availability" hypothesis of Kravis
(1956) and the product cycle hypothesis (Vernon, 1966, and Gruber, Vernon,

and Mehta, (1967). To do this we must stretch these theories to associate
the life cycle of firms with the life cycle of commodities.

The noninvestors, according to this interpretation, are comparatively
new firms producing new or innovative products in the early stages of the

product cycle. Such products tend to be manufactured in the United States
by U.S.—based firms because at that stage of their lives they are still

production stage. These

are possibly capital intensive, and now adaptable to production

with less skilled labor.

In fact, since the production process has

become more routine and does not need the skill of U.S. technical labor,

the U.S. firms must produce abroad where unskilled labor is cheaper or face
losing the market for the product.

We do find the noninvestors to have been small relative to investors
within and among industries and less capital intensive, both as might be

expected from the life—cycle notion. However, several of the results do
not seem to be in accord with the theory: investors were more R&D or
technology intensive, by every measure, both within and among industries,

were the faster growing firms within their industries, and did not differ
substantially from noninvestors in average wage levels, presumably an

indication of skill level. Some of these calculations point to another

explanation of investment. Not every industry manufacturing older
products can transfer its production abroad because production abroad
requires some advantage over local firms such as that conferred by high

technological intensity. In an industry without such advantages, or for a
firm with no technological advantages, production moves from the United
States not to foreign affiliates of U.S. firms but to non—U.S. producers.

That possibility would explain our finding that overseas investors tend to
be from R&D—intensive industries and to be R&D—intensive firms within
industries.

— 26 —

Size of Firm and the Propensity to Invest Abroad
The distinction between the probability of being a foreign investor
and the extent of foreign investment, or propensity to invest or produce

abroad, was made in Hufbauer's (1975) survey. He pointed out that the
evidence available for the United States was on the influence of size on
the likelihood that a firm would be a foreign investor but not on the

extent of such Investment. The distinction was tested in a study of
Swedish firms (Swedenborg, 1979) which confirmed Horst's finding as to the
probability of being a foreign investor but "contradict the common notion
that large firms invest relatively more abroad than small firms do, due to

advantages of firm size or oligopoly considerations." In fact, the elasticity of foreign sales with respect to domestic sales size was reduced
below one in an equation relating foreign affiliate sales not only to
domestic sales but also to R&D intensity, physical—capital intensity, labor
skill (or human capital intensity), and age of foreign operations.

We have not made as thorough an analysis of the U.S. data but a
preliminary look at the 1970 cross—section suggests the same conclusion.

In all manufacturing industries combined the foreign investment
propensities, as measured by median ratios of manufacturing affiliate net
sales to parent domestic sales, did not increase with firm size among those

firms that were investors, as can be seen below. The relationship was
erratic, with the highest foreign sales ratios in the class of firms with
only $50 to $100 million in domestic sales, and lower median ratios of
affiliate to parent sales at the larger parent firm sizes than at the two
smallest

ones shown.

Table 4 shows the results of a set of linear regression equations
across all manufacturing industries, all excluding transportation
equipment, and within 5 broad industry groups, the best breakdown we could

get with this limited number of observations. Two measures of foreign and
domestic size are used: fixed assets and employment.
The equations for all manufacturing firms in the sample have a small
negative constant term, and those for all firms except transport equipment

have a positive one. None is significant, however, and we can interpret
the results as indicating that the equations go through the origin; there

was essentially no relationship between parent size and propensities to

invest abroad. That is, the foreign operations of large parents bore the
same proportion to their domestic operations as did those of small parents.
When we divide the sample into five industries we get mixed results.
Only two constant terms are statistically significant at the 5 per cent
level, a positive one for parent employment in metals and a negative one
for parent employment in metals and a negative one for parent fixed assets

in nonelectrical machinery. The former suggests a negative size effect on
the propensity to invest abroad and the latter a positive one.

the

National Bureau's collection for individual companies. The better ones

for each size variable and each form are shown in Table 5. They show more
evidence for a decline than for a rise in the propensity to invest abroad

as size of firm increases. All the significant coefficients for the
squared size term in arithmetic equations are negative. Of the
coefficients for log of size in the logarithmic equations, all significant
at the 5 per cent level, three are below one and two are above.

The equations for individual industries in Table 6 also give little
support for the idea that size of firm is related to foreign investment

propensities. For the industry with the largest number of observations,
machinery, the best equation includes a significant negative term for the
square of the size variable and the other two arithmetic equations have

insignificant squared terms. The log equations, which fit the data less
well, include two size coefficients below one and one very slightly above.

The chemical industry results are similarly unfavorable to a positive

relation of size to propensity. The arithmetic equations again fit much
better than the log equations and all include negative squared terms for

size. The log equations produce two coefficients for the log of size that
are above one, but only slightly, and one substantially below one. For the
other two industries, foods, and metals and mining (partly outside the
coverage of our industries), we have only 10 to 13 observations for each

equation. The arithmetic equations, again the better ones, include no
significant squared terms. The log equations, which do not fit as well, do
have some coefficients for log of size substantially above one. The only
significant evidence we have for a positive relationship between size and
the propensity to invest abroad is for the oil industry, which is outside

the range of our study. In that case the log equation is the better one

and the coefficient for log of size is well above two. However, there are
only 10 observations for this equation.

Our general conclusion on the influence of size of firm is to support
the belief that it is an important influence, but only as a threshold

effect: an effect on the decision to invest abroad but not, once foreign
investment has been established, on the fraction of the firm's resources

devoted to foreign activity. It reflects economies of scale, not in
production, but in foreign investing, and such economies of scale account
for the higher frequency of foreign investors among larger firms.

However,

they seem to be in the nature of indivisibilities which have little or no
influence once a firm has surmounted the initial barrier to becoming a
foreign investor.

The Location of Investment

Another question we can ask is whether the technological
characteristics of industries and firms influence their choices among

locations for investment. We pursue this issue first by comparing the
parents that located in two very different types of host countries, Sweden
on the one hand, a high—wage, high—skill, developed country, and Brazil and
Mexico on the other, two rapidly industrializing developing countries, but

with

far lower wages and skill levels than Sweden. Those countries are

compared here not only because of the contrast

in

environments they provide

but also because reasonably complete lists of U.S. investors are available
that permit us to use our own company data for analysis (Table 7).
Investors in Sweden were far more R&D—intensive firms than those in

Brazil or Mexico, as measured by the ratios of R&D expenditures to

sales

and employment. They were from R&D—intensive and technology—intensive

The list of U.S. investors in Sweden was supplied by an agency of the

industries,

by the same measures as well as by measures of employment.

They were in addition, by a large margin, the more R&D—intensive firms
within their industries.

Since Sweden is a high—wage country, at least for unskilled labor, we

might expect it to attract the most capital—intensive U.S. firms. In fact,
the parents of Mexican and Brazilian affiliates were more capital intensive
and were from more capital—intensive industries than those investing in

Sweden. Within industries, however, we could not observe any consistent
relationship to capital intensity.

Sweden's comparative advantage is often associated with skill
intensity, but our measure, compensation per employee, suggests that skill
intensity did not distinguish investors in Sweden from those investing in

Mexico or Brazil. The investors in Sweden came from industries of somewhat
higher skill levels but within their industries they were lower wage—firms.

In other words, firms which, within their industries, were the lower-wage
firms, presumably those with a lower—skill labor force, tended to establish
affiliates in one of the highest—wage countries .iith a highly skilled labor

force, as if they were seeking characteristics in their affiliates opposite
to those of the parent operations in the United States.7
Among the other firm characteristics we have information for,

investors in Sweden were smaller and they were from industries
characterized by relatively small firms, probably a reflection of the
concentration on machinery investment8 and the absence of U.S. auto

companies. They were also relatively small firms in their industries.
There are thus indications that economies of scale in production were a
characteristic that did not favor locating in Sweden.

The firms investing in Sweden were from industries of faster growing

— 37 —

and more profitable firms and they were also, within their industries, the
firms with these characteristics. Both of these may be related to the high
level of R&D intensity among investors in Sweden.

The sharpest distinction we found between firms investing in Sweden
and those investing in Mexico or Brazil was the extent of expenditure on

R&D. The higher R&D levels of the firms investing in Sweden were clearly
not related to size since the Swedish firms tended to be smaller, and we
thus have further evidence of the importance of this technology input
variable in explaining within—industry differences in investment.

A more systematic view of the selection of parents for investing in
different locations can be gained from the latest survey of U.S. direct

investment (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1981). One indication of the
selection of parents is the distribution, by industry, of parents investing

in various areas of the world. Table 8 gives one measure of that
distribution, the share of each major industry in the total of parent—firm

assets. There is no indication here that physical—capital—intensive U.S.
industries, defined as those with high levels of plant and equipment per
worker, consistently concentrated their investment in high income countries
and labor—intensive U.S. industries in low—income, presumably low—labor—

cost countries. The most capital—intensive industry, chemicals,
represented a higher proportion of investment in developing countries than
in developed countries, while the nonelectrical machinery industry, which

is labor—intensive, was concentrated in developed countries. On the other

electrical machinery and transportation equipment, both laborintensive, tended to be more heavily represented in low—income countries.
hand,

Similarly, R&D—intensive industries did not consistently choose locations

with highly educated populations. Electrical machinery and chemicals, two

Two measures of the capital intensity of parents investing in
different areas of the world are given in Table 9.

and financial capital. We

show average capital intensities of

investing in different areas, for all manufacturing and for several

Industry groups, using weighted and unweighted averages within countries.
One fairly

consistent feature of the table is that unweighted averages

of net property, plant, and equipment per worker

of Investors in Canada are

lower than weighted averages, overall and In all industries except foods.

Furthermore, the unweighted averages for investors in Canada are
consistently below those for investors in Europe and even those for
investors in developing countries, even though Canadian wages were higher
than European wages and much higher than developing country wages.

Weighted averages for investors in Canada also tend to be relatively low,

but not as consistently or by so much. Since the difference between the
weighted and unweighted averages is in the weight given to the larger
parents,

it tells us something about

the relation of parent size, capital

intensity, and investment location. High physical capital intensity was

industries,

were more likely to invest In Canada than in developing

countries despite their labor intensity. The reason was presumably that
because they were small they did not wish to take the risks or costs of
investment in developing countries.
The direction of differences between uriweighted and weighted parent

firm capital intensities is often consistent within industries. In foods
and electrical machinery almost all the unweighted averages are higher for

both total assets and fixed assets per employee. For metals, nonelectrical
machinery, transportation equipment, and "other manufacturing," the

weighted averages are higher. For chemicals, unweighted averages of total
assets per employee are higher while unweighted averages of fixed assets

per employee are lower than weighted. The implication seems to be that
large parent firms were more capital intensive in metals, nonelectrical
machinery, transportation equipment, and the miscellaneous group but were
more labor intensive in foods and electrical machinery and, as measured by
total assets per worker, in chemicals.

Most of the figures show slightly higher capital intensity among
investors in developing countries than among those in developed countries.

The differences are small and not very consistent from industry to

industry. Although the capital intensities derived from weighted averages
within countries are often quite different from those derived from
unweighted averages, they tell essentially the same story about the capital
intensity of investors in developed and developing countries.

The relation among parent capital intensity, host—country labor cost,
and parents' selection of countries for investment was examined by
regressions across host countries of parent capital intensity on average

compensation per worker in affiliates.9 The results agree with our

- 42

-

impression from Tables 8 and 9: none of the coefficients is statistically
significant and more are negative than positive. If there is any relation
between the two variables It Is more likely negative than positive, but the
evidence for any relationship is very weak.

Another set of parent company characteristics we can examine is

related to the technical level of the companies. These characteristics
include the average skill level of employees, as measured by average
compensation per worker, and three variables related to technological

Intensity. These are R&D expenditures as a per cent of sales and two
measures of technology sales: the importance relative to sales of license
fees received from firms not controlled by the parent and of sales under
license by foreign firms not controlled by the parent.

Investors in developing countries were parents with slightly higher
average compensation than those investing in developed countries among
manufacturing companies in general, but there was no consistent relation

within industries (Table 10). The only fairly consistent difference Is
that investors in Canada seem to have been among the lower-skilled
companies In their Industries relative to other investors, despite the

comparatively high level of education of the Canadian labor force. This
result may reflect the size of investors in Canada mentioned earlier (see

also Kravls and Lipsey, 1982) rather than any selection on the basis of
labor force quality.

Regressions across countries within industries of parent average wage
(assumed to represent parent firm skill levels) against average quality of

each country's labor force (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982) produce no significant

coefficients.

—

The coefficients larger than their standard errors, for

three of the seven industries, are all negative. That is, if there was any
faintly visible relationship, lower—skill firms within their industries in
the United States tended to operate in countries with higher labor quality.

Our measure of parent R&D intensity, R&D expenditures as a per cent of

sales, reveals a surprising relationship. Investors in developing
countries were more R&D—intensive than investors in developed countries in

manufacturing as a whole and in
were

every

industry. Some of the differences

very small but some were substantial. With respect to this measure as

was true of others, investors in Canada were different:
R&D intensive than
in

in this case less

any other area, and by a large margin
several cases. However, even investors in Europe were less R&D
those investing in

intensive than investors in developing

countries in every

industry. In the

two machinery industries, the margin was quite large. There was little
difference in R&D intensity between investors in Europe and investors In
Latin America, but the machinery parent companies investing In the
developing Asian countries were particularly R&D intensive.

The figures for individual countries (not shown in our tables)

that

confirm

investors in Canada were among the least research intensive, even if

they were not the lowest. Our earlier finding from the individual company
dta for 1972 that investors in Sweden were particularly R&D intensive is
supported here only for the nonelectrical machinery Industry. That was,
however, by far, the main area of U.S. investment in Sweden. In other
industries we do not find investors in Sweden particularly R&D intensive

even relative to those investing in Brazil and Mexico. Investors In

— 45 —

individual

developing Asian countries were not only much more R&D intensive

than others In the machinery industries hut slightly more R&D intensive In
all the other Industries except foods.

Regressions across countries within industries in which we related
parent R&D intensity to average host—country labor quality again failed to
reveal any selection of parents, or of investment locations by parents, on

this basis. Only one of the coefficients was even as large as its own
standard error.

The apparent affinity of R&D—intensive parents for low—income

countries may be related to other characteristics of the parents. Larger
parents may tend to have higher R&D Intensities and may also be more able

to bear the costs of investing in developing countries. The latter point
has been documented in this paper and elsewhere (for example, Kravis and

Lipsey, 1982). The developed countries thus attract both larger and
smaller U.S. parents while the developing countries attract mainly the
large ones.

The particularly high R&D intensity of machinery Industry investors in
developing Asian countries must reflect to some degree the policies of the
semiconductor and computer companies, which are particularly R&D—intensive.

U.S. parents' Investment in developing countries of Asia (except the Middle
East) and the Pacific is heavily concentrated In "Electronic Components and
Accessories" within electrical machinery and "Office and Computing

Machines," within nonelectrical machinery. The ability of the
semiconductor companies to split their stages of production between labor—
intensive operations, carried out in developing countries, and skill— and

— 46 —

technology—intensive operations carried on in developed countries is partly
responsible for this apparently paradoxical choice of host countries by R&D
intensive parents (see Firian, 1975).

We include two measures of technology sales in Table 10. One is the
ratio to parent sales of fees and royalties received by the parent from

foreign entities other than its own affiliates. The other is product sales
by uncontrolled foreign entities under license from the parent. We

interpret them as representing a mixture of two elements: the
technological level of the parent, which permits it to have some technology
to sell to others, and the tendency to exploit that technology outside the
United States by sales of the technology itself rather than by production

of the goods embodying it. A firm or industry with little technology to
sell would presumably show low ratios to total sales of fees and royalties

and uncontrolled product sales under license. The food industry might be
an example of this situation, since it has low ratios of both R&D and

technology sales to total sales. A firm or industry at a fairly high
technological level might still show low ratios of technology sales to
total sales if it chose to exploit its technological capital by producing

abroad rather than by sales of the technology itself. This might be the
case for the motor vehicle industry which is only slightly below average in
R&D

expenditure but far below average in the importance of uncontrolled

product sales under license.

Differences in

sales levels

between investors in developed

and developing countries were not very large or consistent among

industries. Within industries two major differences stand out. Electrical

— 47 —

machinery companies investing in developed countries reported larger sales
by uncontrolled companies under license (but not larger income from such
sales) than those investing in developing countries while the latter spent

more heavily on R&D. In the other manufacturing group, investors in
developing countries, and especially those investing in Asia, reported both
relatively high sales by uncontrolled companies under license and high
income from fees and royalties from such sales, while they were no more

research—intensive than were investors in Europe. Investors in Canada
were, overall, the lowest in sales under license, income from such sales,
and R&D intensity, but the picture is very different in some industries.
Chemical and metals industry investors in Canada were the least
R&D—intensive group but reported the highest ratios of fees and royalties
received and of sales under license, while "other manufacturing" investors
in Canada were low in all three respects.

Along the same lines we ran a set of regressions across host
countries, including and excluding Canada, relating two characteristics of
parents investing in them, from the unpublished U.S. Department of Commerce

data for 1977. The dependent variable was the importance to the parents of
technology sales, as measured by the ratio of sales by uncontrolled foreign
entities under license from the parents (TS), and the independent variable

was the ratio of parent R&D expenditures to parent sales (RD). None of the
equations for manufacturing as a whole, foods, chemicals, electrical
machinery, or transportation equipment, explained any of the variation in

technology sales. Equations for the other industries, excluding Canada,
based on 24 observations, are as follows (equations including Canada were

The relationships seem to vary among the industries. In metals and in
"other manufacturing industries," the more R&D intensive the firms

investing in a country, the greater the importance of sales by uncontrolled

firms under their licenses. In the nonelectrical machinery industry, on
the other hand, higher R&D intensity was negatively related to sales by

others under license. The equation for electrical machinery also had a
negative coefficient hut explained very little of the variation in

technology sales. It may be characteristic of machinery industries that
they exploit their technological capital in foreign markets by production

rather than by licensing. However, this is a question that should be
examined at the individual firm level rather than, as here, by looking at
differences among parents investing in groups of contries.

Conclusions

The strongest influence on the likelihood that a U.S. manufacturing
firm will be a foreign investor is the size of the firm, as has been noted

by others. Profitability, capital intensity, technological intensity, the
skill level of the labor force, and the rate of growth of the firm, are
also all positively related to the probability of being an investor.
We separated these relationships between effects common to firms in an
industry and those related to differences between a firm and the industry

— 49 —

average.

About half of the firm

size

effect can be attributed to the

industry of the parent firm and capital intensity is mostly an industry
effect.

Aside from industry differences and that of size of firm within an

industry we found,

that

in contrast

to some earlier studies, two characteristics

influenced the selection of firms within industries. One is the

extent of input into R&D, which is a technological input, and the other is
profitability, which might reflect the output from technological input or
market power derived from other sources.

The selection of firms and industries as foreign investors tends to
bring

to foreign countries the attributes of the more technically oriented,

faster-growing, and more profitable of U.S. manufacturing firms within

their industries, as well as the larger firms. It also brings to foreign
countries U.S. firms from industries that are capital
technologically

While

intensive and

oriented.

a number of studies have examined the factors determining the

probability of a firm's being a foreign investor, few have attempted to
explain the propensity to invest abroad——that is, the determinants of the

size of foreign investment or activity relative to domestic. The results
of our test of the effects of size of firm on investment propensities were
somewhat surprising in view of the conclusive evidence that size is the

major determinant of the probability of foreign investment. For
manufacturing as a whole and for major industry groups within manufacturing
we could find little or no evidence from two independent sources of company
data of any relationship between the domestic size of a parent company and
the propensity to invest abroad. Thus the frequently mentioned
concentration of manufacturing abroad in a small number of companies
appears to be nothing but a reflection of the concentration among

— 50 —

manufacturing

firms

in

the United States.

Our conclusion about the influence of size of firm

is

to support the

belief that it is important, but only as a threshold effect. It affects
the decision to invest abroad or to invest in a particular area but not,

once manufacturing has been established, the fraction of the firm's

resources that are devoted to foreign operations. The influence of size,
we conclude, reflects economies of scale, not in production, but in foreign
investing, and such economies of scale account for the higher frequency of

foreign investment among larger firms. However, these economies of scale
seem to result from indivisibilities that have little or no influence once
a firm has surmounted the initial barrier to becoming a foreign investor.
We could find only a few, and rather weak relationships between the
characteristics of parent firms and the locations of their foreign
operations, as measured by the likelihood that they would invest in

particular locations. Investors in low—income countries were not
predominantly U.S. companies that paid low wages or were labor intensive

in their U.S. operations. Relatively R&D—intensive or skill—intensive U.S
companies or those from relatively R&D—intensive or skill—intensive

industries were not more likely to invest in developed countries. In fact
the average firm investing in developing countries was slightly more R&D

intensive than the average investor in developed countries. Investors in
developing Asian countries in particular were relatively R&D intensive for

their industries. Thus the characteristics of parent firms that led to
foreign investment also led to investment in the developing countries, with
perhaps a greater emphasis on size and technological intensity.

Other parent—firm characteristics we investigated were income from
technology sales and the importance of sales by uncontrolled foreign

— 51 —

licenses

relative to the parents' sales. Two types of relationship were

noticed: in the electrical machinery industry, investors in developing
countries spent more on R&D relative to their sales than investors in
developed countries but reported smaller sales by uncontrolled firms under
license, and in the machinery industries R&D—intensive companies tended to

license less. In other words, these companies apparently tended to exploit
their technological capital in foreign markets by production rather than by

licensing. On the other hand, in metals and in "other manufacturing
industries" there was a positive relation between R&D intensity and
licensing.

Foot notes
1

Since size is such a major difference between the investors and the
noninvestors, one might suppose that it alone might account for some of the
differences in other characteristics between the two groups, if those
characteristics, such as profitability, are related to size. In fact, size
does not seem to be a strong influence on most of the other variables in
equations across all firms. Where it was, we tested the effect of size on
the differences between investors and noninvestors. For example, we substituted, for the profitability measure (Pr), defined as Net Income/Sales, the
residuals from an equation relating profitability to size, such as

Pr = a + b (Sales)
Pr = a + b (log Sales)
log Pr = a + b (log Sales)
and then compared investors and noninvestors with respect to PR — PR, the
latter being the "expected" profitability from one of the equations. The
conclusions were not altered by that calculation; the other variables'
influence was not simply a reflection of their relation to size. However,
taking account of size did reduce the margin substantially, from the 1.7
percentage points shown in the table to only .6 percentage points, using an
arithmetic equation, or from over 35 per cent to less than 10 per cent using
a log equation.

"...direct investment entails higher (relatively fixed) costs of
search and investigation than do exporting or licensing, and thus is more
likely the game of the firm big enough to amortize these search costs over a
large direct investment outlay' (Caves, 1974).
3

The same R&D variable has a fairly weak effect on the propensity of
Swedish firms to produce abroad (Swedenborg, 1979). That fact suggests that
the role of R&D input may be a characteristic of U.S. multinationals rather
than of multinationals in general. However, the variables that affect the
propensity to invest (the ratio of foreign to home—country investment) are
not necessarily the same as those that affect the probability of investing
(the proportion of firms in a group that do any foreign investing at all) as
we shall see below, and there are also other differences between the Swedish
and U.S. analyses. We therefore cannot make a strong statement on this
question.
4

Although we are dealing with characteristics associated with any
investment abroad rather than with the proportion of production carried Out
abroad (propensity to invest) it is of some interest to compare these

— 53 —

characteristics

with those that determined the propensity to invest of
Swedish parent firms (Swedenborg, 1979). Aside from size, discussed later,
the labor skill level was positively related and physical—capital intensity
negatively related to the Swedish foreign investment propensities. Those
facts suggest that multinational firms from different countries may not
carry the same set of advantages.
5

Table 2 probably exaggerates the difference associated with industry
composition because, in the enterprise data, investors are much more fully
covered than noninvestors and dominate our industry averages. However, an
industry size measure from establishment data (not shown here), not subject
to this problem, gives the same results: investors are from industries in
which the median size of establishment is larger.
6

This difference is undoubtedly underestimated here because the nonin—
vestors missing from our data must consist mainly of small firms.
7

That strange result is not a peculiarity of this pair of countries.
In another paper (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982) we found, across a broader set of
countries, that high—wage, presumably high—skill companies showed some tendency to locate not in high—wage host countries, for example, but in low—
wage countries, and low—wage parents located in high—wage countries. The
most capital—intensive parents located in low—wage countries and the least
capital intensive in high—wage countries.
8

44 per cent of U.S. manufacturing investment in Sweden, measured by the
U.S. direct investment position, was in norielectrical machinery, the highest
share for any host country, although Japan was close (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 1981, Table I.W3). U.S. machinery industry parents were, on the
average, 25 per cent smaller, as measured by total assets, than U.S. manufacturing parents in general (ibid, Table C).
9

In these regressions, differences among host countries in compensation
per worker are presumed to reflect differences in costs of equivalent labor
to a substantial degree, although we know that differences in labor quality
are also included. That interpretation contrasts with the one we apply to
average wage differences among industries or companies within the United
States, which we consider as measuring differences in labor quality.
The
underlying assumption is that labor is fairly mobile among companies and
industries within the United States but not among countries. To test the
consequences of treating inter—country differences in average wages as
measures of the price of labor we ran the regressions substituting for
average wage in 1977 the same wage corrected for differences in labor
quality measured for an earlier period (see Kravis and Lipsey, 1982, for a
discussion of the correction). The results were essentially the same.
