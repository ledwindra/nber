    "abstract": "\n\nAlmost $10 trillion is benchmarked to Morgan Stanley Capital International\u2019s Developed, Emerging, Frontier, and standalone market indexes. Reclassifications from one index to another require thousands of investors to decide how to react. We study a comprehensive sample of past reclassifications to inform this decision. On average, reclassified markets\u2019 prices substantially overshoot between the announcement and effective dates\u2014prices fall when a market moves from an index with more benchmarked ownership to one with less, such from Emerging to Frontier, and vice-versa\u2014but largely revert within a year. We identify alpha-maximizing responses to reclassifications for both benchmarked and more flexible investors.\n\n",
