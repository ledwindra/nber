ABSTRACT
This paper computes welfare-maximizing monetary and fiscal policy rules in a real business cycle
model augmented with sticky prices, a demand for money, taxation, and stochastic government
consumption. We consider simple feedback rules whereby the nominal interest rate is set as a
function of output and inflation, and taxes are set as a function of total government liabilities. We
implement a second-order accurate solution to the model. Our main findings are: First, the size of
the inflation coefficient in the interest-rate rule plays a minor role for welfare. It matters only insofar
as it affects the determinacy of equilibrium. Second, optimal monetary policy features a muted
response to output. More importantly, interest rate rules that feature a positive response to output can
lead to significant welfare losses. Third, the welfare gains from interest-rate smoothing are
negligible. Fourth, optimal fiscal policy is passive. Finally, the optimal monetary and fiscal rule
combination attains virtually the same level of welfare as the Ramsey optimal policy.

Introduction

Recently, there has been an outburst of papers studying optimal monetary policy in economies
with nominal rigidities.1 Most of these studies are conducted in the context of highly stylized
theoretical and policy environments. For instance, in much of this body of work it is assumed
that the government has access to a subsidy to factor inputs, financed with lump-sum taxes,
aimed at dismantling the inefficiency introduced by imperfect competition in product and
factor markets. This assumption is clearly empirically unrealistic. But more importantly it
undermines a potentially significant role for monetary policy, namely, stabilization of costly
aggregate fluctuations around a distorted steady-state equilibrium.
A second notable simplification is the absence of capital accumulation. All the way
from the work of Keynes (1936) and Hicks (1939) to that of Kydland and Prescott (1982)
macroeconomic theories have emphasized investment dynamics as an important channel for
the transmission of aggregate disturbances. It is therefore natural to expect that investment
spending should play a role in shaping optimal monetary policy. Indeed it has been shown,
that for a given monetary regime the determinacy properties of a standard Neo-Keynesian
model can change dramatically when the assumption of capital accumulation is added to the
model (Dupor, 2001; Carlstrom and Fuerst, 2005).
A third important dimension along which the existing studies abstract from reality is the
assumed fiscal regime. It is standard practice in this literature to completely ignore fiscal
policy. Implicitly, these models assume that the fiscal budget is balanced at all times by
means of lump-sum taxation. In other words, fiscal policy is always assumed to be nondistorting and passive in the sense of Leeper (1991). However, empirical studies, such as
Favero and Monacelli (2003), show that characterizing postwar U.S. fiscal policy as passive
at all times is at odds with the facts. In addition, it is well known theoretically that,
given monetary policy, the determinacy properties of the rational expectations equilibrium
crucially depend on the nature of fiscal policy (e.g., Leeper, 1991). It follows that the design
of optimal monetary policy should depend upon the underlying fiscal regime in a nontrivial
fashion.
Fourth, model-based analyses of optimal monetary policy is typically restricted to economies
in which long-run inflation is nil or there is some form of wide-spread indexation. As a result, in the standard environments studied in the literature nominal rigidities have no real
consequences for economic activity and thus welfare in the long-run. It follows that the
assumptions of zero long-run inflation or indexation should not be expected to be inconse1

quential for the form that optimal monetary policy takes. Because from an empirical point
of view, neither of these two assumptions is particularly compelling for economies like the
United States, it is of interest to investigate the characteristics of optimal policy in their
absence.
Last but not least, more often than not studies of optimal policy in models with nominal
rigidities are conducted in cashless environments.2 This assumption introduces an inflationstabilization bias into optimal monetary policy. For the presence of a demand for money
creates a motive to stabilize the nominal interest rate rather than inflation.
Taken together the simplifying assumptions discussed above imply that business cycles
are centered around an efficient non-distorted equilibrium. The main reason why these rather
unrealistic features have been so widely adopted is not that they are the most empirically
obvious ones to make nor that researchers believe that they are inconsequential for the nature
of optimal monetary policy. Rather, the motivation is purely technical. Namely, the stylized
models considered in the literature make it possible for a first-order approximation to the
equilibrium conditions to be sufficient to accurately approximate welfare up to second order.
Any plausible departure from the set of simplifying assumptions mentioned above, with the
exception of the assumption of no investment dynamics, would require approximating the
equilibrium conditions to second order.
Recent advances in computational economics have delivered algorithms that make it feasible and simple to compute higher-order approximations to the equilibrium conditions of
a general class of large stochastic dynamic general equilibrium models.3 In this paper, we
employ these new tools to analyze a model that relaxes all of the questionable assumptions
mentioned above. The central focus of this paper is to investigate whether the policy conclusions arrived at by the existing literature regarding the optimal conduct of monetary policy
are robust with respect to more realistic specifications of the economic environment. That is,
we study optimal policy in a world where there are no subsidies to undo the distortions created by imperfect competition, where there is capital accumulation, where the government
may follow active fiscal policy and may not have access to lump-sum taxation, where nominal rigidities induce inefficiencies even in the long run, and where there is a nonnegligible
demand for money.
Specifically, this paper characterizes monetary and fiscal policy rules that are optimal
within a family of implementable, simple rules in a calibrated model of the business cycle.
In the model economy, business cycles are driven by stochastic variations in the level of total
factor productivity and government consumption. The implementability condition requires

policies to deliver uniqueness of the rational expectations equilibrium. Simplicity requires
restricting attention to rules whereby policy variables are set as a function of a small number
of easily observable macroeconomic indicators. Specifically, we study interest-rate feedback
rules that respond to measures of inflation, output and lagged values of the nominal interest
rate. We analyze fiscal policy rules whereby the tax revenue is set as an increasing function
of the level of public liabilities. The optimal simple and implementable rule is the simple and
implementable rule that maximizes welfare of the individual agent. As a point of comparison
for policy evaluation, we compute the real allocation associated with the Ramsey optimal
policy.
Our findings suggest that the precise degree to which the central bank responds to inflation in setting the nominal interest rate (i.e., the size of the inflation coefficient in the
interest-rate rule) plays a minor role for welfare provided that the monetary/fiscal regime
renders the equilibrium unique. For instance, in all of the many environments we consider,
deviating from the optimal policy rule by setting the inflation coefficient anywhere above
unity yields virtually the same level of welfare as the optimal rule. Thus, the fact that
optimal policy features an active monetary stance serves mainly the purpose of ensuring
the uniqueness of the rational expectations equilibrium. Second, optimal monetary policy
features a muted response to output. More importantly, not responding to output is critical
from a welfare point of view. In effect, our results show that interest rate rules that feature a
positive response of the nominal interest rate to output can lead to significant welfare losses.
Third, the welfare gains from interest-rate smoothing are negligible. Fourth, the optimal
fiscal policy is passive. Finally, the optimal simple and implementable policy rule attains
virtually the same level of welfare as the Ramsey optimal policy.
Kollmann (2003) also considers welfare maximizing fiscal and monetary rules in a sticky
price model with capital accumulation. He also finds that optimal monetary policy features
a strong anti-inflationary stance. However, the focus of his paper differs from ours in a
number of dimensions. First, Kollmann does not consider the size of the welfare losses that
are associated with non-optimal rules, which is at center stage in our work. Second, in
his paper the interest rate feedback rule is not allowed to depend on a measure of aggregate
activity and as a consequence the paper does not identify the importance of not responding to
output. Third, Kollmann limits attention to a cashless economy with zero long run inflation.
Finally, in Kollmann’s paper policy evaluation do not take the Ramsey optimal policy as the
point of comparison.
The remainder of the paper is organized in six sections. Section 2 presents the model.
Section 3 presents the calibration of the model and discusses computational issues. Section 4
computes optimal policy in a cashless economy. Section 5 analyzes optimal policy in a
3

monetary economy. Section 6 introduces fiscal instruments as part of the optimal policy
design problem. Section 7 concludes.

The Model

The starting point for our investigation into the welfare consequences of alternative policy
rules is an economic environment featuring a blend of neoclassical and neo-Keynesian elements. Specifically, the skeleton of the economy is a standard real-business-cycle model with
capital accumulation and endogenous labor supply driven by technology and government
spending shocks. Five sources of inefficiency separate our model from the standard RBC
framework: (a) nominal rigidities in the form of sluggish price adjustment. (b) A demand
for money by firms motivated by a working-capital constraint on labor costs. (c) A demand
for money by household originated in a cash-in-advance constraint. (d) monopolistic competition in product markets. And (e) time-varying distortionary taxation. These five elements
of the model provide a rationale for the conduct of monetary and fiscal stabilization policy.

2.1

Households

The economy is populated by a continuum of identical households. Each household has
preferences defined over consumption, ct , and labor effort, ht . Preferences are described by
the utility function

index assumed to be strictly increasing in its first argument, strictly decreasing in its second
argument, and strictly concave. The consumption good is assumed to be a composite good
produced with a continuum of differentiated goods, cit , i ∈ [0, 1], via the aggregator function

good, purchases of each variety i in period t must solve the dual problem of minimizing

total expenditure, 0 Pit cit di, subject to the aggregation constraint (2), where Pit denotes

the nominal price of a good of variety i at time t. The optimal level of cit is then given by

This price index has the property that the minimum cost of a bundle of intermediate goods
yielding ct units of the composite good is given by Pt ct .
Households are assumed to have access to a complete set of nominal contingent claims.
Expenditures on consumption are subject to a cash-in-advance constraint of the form
mht ≥ ν h ct ,

where mht denotes real money holdings by the household in period t and ν h ≥ 0 is a parameter.

where dt,s is a stochastic discount factor, defined so that Et dt,s xs is the nominal value in
period t of a random nominal payment xs in period s ≥ t. The variable kt denotes capital,
it denotes gross investment, φ̃t denotes profits received from the ownership of firms net of
income taxes, τtD denotes the income tax rate, and τtL denotes lump-sum taxes. The variable
q̃t denotes the market price of one unit of installed capital. The term δτtD q̃t kt represents a
depreciation allowance for tax purposes. The capital stock is assumed to depreciate at the
constant rate δ, and changes in the capital stock are assumed to be subject to a convex
adjustment cost. The evolution of capital is given by

(7)

The function Ψ is assumed to satisfy Ψ(1) = 1, Ψ0 (1) = 0, and Ψ00 (1) < 0. These assumptions
ensure no adjustment costs in the vicinity of the deterministic steady state. The investment
good is assumed to be a composite good made with the aggregator function (2). Thus,
the demand for each intermediate good i ∈ [0, 1] for investment purposes, denoted iit , is
given by iit = (Pit /Pt )−η it . Households are also assumed to be subject to a borrowing limit

5

that prevents them from engaging in Ponzi schemes. The household’s problem consists in
maximizing the utility function (1) subject to (5), (6), (7), and the no-Ponzi-game borrowing
limit referred to above. Letting ζt λt β t , λt β t , and qt λt β t denote, respectively, the Lagrange
multipliers associated with (5), (6), and (7), the first-order conditions associated with the
household’s problem are

It is apparent from these first-order conditions that the income tax distorts both the leisurelabor choice and the decision to accumulate capital over time. At the same time, the opportunity cost of holding money, 1/(1 − ζt ), which, as will become clear below equals the gross
nominal interest rate, distorts both the labor/leisure choice and the intertemporal allocation
of consumption.

2.2

The Government

The consolidated government prints money, Mt , issues one-period nominally risk-free bonds,
Bt , collects taxes in the amount of Pt τt , and faces an exogenous expenditure stream, gt . Its
period-by-period budget constraint is given by
Mt + Bt = Rt−1 Bt−1 + Mt−1 + Pt gt − Pt τt .
Here Rt denotes the gross one-period, risk-free, nominal interest rate in period t. By a
no-arbitrage condition, Rt must equal the inverse of the period-t price of a portfolio that
pays one dollar in every state of period t + 1. That is, Rt = 1/Et dt,t+1 . Combining this
expression with the optimality conditions associated with the household’s problem yields

6

the usual Euler equation
λt = βRt Et

λt+1
,
πt+1

(13)

where πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 denotes the gross consumer price inflation. The variable gt denotes
per capita government spending on a composite good produced via the aggregator (2). We
assume, maybe unrealistically, that the government minimizes the cost of producing gt .
Thus, we have that the public demand for each type i of intermediate goods, git , is given by
git = (Pit /Pt )−η gt . Let `t−1 ≡ (Mt−1 +Rt−1 Bt−1 )/Pt−1 denote total real government liabilities
outstanding at the end of period t − 1 in units of period t − 1 goods. Also, let mt ≡ Mt /Pt
denote real money balances in circulation. Then the government budget constraint can be
written as
`t =

Rt
`t−1 + Rt (gt − τt ) − mt (Rt − 1).
πt

(14)

We wish to consider various alternative fiscal policy specifications that involve possibly
both lump sum and distortionary income taxation. Total tax revenues, τt , consist of revenue
from lump-sum taxation, τtL , and revenue from income taxation, τtD yt , where yt denotes
aggregate demand.4 That is,
τt = τtL + τtD yt .

(15)

The fiscal regime is defined by the following rule:
τt − τ ∗ = γ1 (`t−1 − `∗ ),

(16)

where γ1 is a parameter, and τ ∗ and `∗ denote the deterministic Ramsey steady-state values of
τt and `t , respectively. According to this rule, the fiscal authority sets tax revenues in period
t, τt , as a linear function of the real value of total government liabilities, `t−1 . Combining
this fiscal rule with the government sequential budget constraint (14) yields
`t =

Rt
(1 − πt γ1 )`t−1 + Rt (γ1 `∗ − τ ∗ ) + Rt gt − mt (Rt − 1).
πt

When γ1 lies in the interval (0, 2/π ∗ ), we say, following the terminology of Leeper (1991),
that fiscal policy is passive. Intuitively, in this case, in a stationary equilibrium near the
deterministic steady state, deviations of real government liabilities from their nonstochastic
steady-state level grow at a rate less than the real interest rate. As a result, the present
4

In the economy with distortionary taxes only, we implicitly assume that profits are taxed in such a way
that the tax base equals aggregate demand. In the absence of profit taxation, the tax base would equal
wt ht + (ut − δqt )kt . As shown in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004b,d), untaxed profits create an inflation
bias in the Ramsey policy. This is because the Ramsey planner uses the inflation tax as an indirect tax on
profits.

7

discounted value of government liabilities is expected to converge to zero regardless of the
stance of monetary policy. Alternatively, when γ1 lies outside of the range (0, 2/π ∗ ), we say
that fiscal policy is active. In this case, government liabilities grow at a rate greater than
the real interest rate in absolute value in the neighborhood of the deterministic steady state.
Consequently, the present discounted value of real government liabilities is not expected to
vanish for all possible specifications of monetary policy. Under active fiscal policy, the price
level plays an active role in bringing about fiscal solvency in equilibrium.
We focus on four alternative fiscal regimes. In two all taxes are lump sum (τ D = 0),
and in the other two all taxes are distortionary (τ L = 0). We consider passive fiscal policy
/ (0, 2/π ∗ )).
(γ1 ∈ (0, 2/π ∗ )) and active fiscal policy (γ1 ∈
We assume that the monetary authority sets the short-term nominal interest rate according to a simple feedback rule belonging to the following class of Taylor (1993)-type rules
ln(Rt /R∗ ) = αR ln(Rt−1 /R∗ ) + απ Et ln(πt−i /π ∗ ) + αy Et ln(yt−i /y ∗ );

i = −1, 0, 1,

(17)

where y ∗ denotes the nonstochastic Ramsey steady-state level of aggregate demand, and R∗ ,
π ∗ , αR , απ ,, and αy are parameters. The index i can take three values 1, 0, and -1. When
i = 1, we refer to the interest rate rule as backward looking, when i = 0 as contemporaneous,
and when i = −1 as forward looking. The reason why we focus on interest rate feedback rules
belonging to this class is that they are defined in terms of readily available macroeconomic
indicators.
We note that the type of monetary policy rules that are typically analyzed in the related
literature require no less information on the part of the policymaker than the feedback rule
given in equation (17). This is because the rules most commonly studied feature an output
gap measure defined as deviations of output from the level that would obtain in the absence
of nominal rigidities. Computing the flexible-price level of aggregate activity requires the
policymaker to know not just the deterministic steady state of the economy—which is the
information needed to implement the interest-rate rule given in equation (17)—but also the
joint distribution of all the shocks driving the economy and the current realizations of such
shocks.
We will also study an interest-feedback rule whereby the change in the nominal interest
rate is set as a function of its own lag, lagged output growth, and lagged deviations of
inflation from target. Formally, this monetary rule is given by
ln(Rt /Rt−1 ) = αR ln(Rt−1 /Rt−2 ) + απ ln(πt−1 /π ∗ ) + αy ln(yt−1 /yt−2 ).

(18)

This specification of monetary policy is of interest because its implementation requires min8

imal information. Specifically, the central bank need not know the steady-state values of
output or the nominal interest rate. Furthermore, implementation of this rule does not
require knowledge of current or future expected values of inflation or output.

2.3

Firms

Each good’s variety i ∈ [0, 1] is produced by a single firm in a monopolistically competitive
environment. Each firm i produces output using as factor inputs capital services, kit , and
labor services, hit . The production technology is given by
zt F (kit , hit ) − χ,
where the function F is assumed to be homogenous of degree one, concave, and strictly
increasing in both arguments. The variable zt denotes an exogenous, aggregate productivity
shock. The parameter χ introduces fixed costs of production, which are meant to soak up
steady-state profits in conformity with the stylized fact that profits are close to zero on
average in the U.S. economy.
It follows from our analysis of private and public absorption behavior that the aggregate
demand for good i, denoted ait ≡ cit + iit + git , is given by
ait = (Pit /Pt )−η at ,
where at ≡ ct + it + gt denotes aggregate absorption.
We introduce a demand for money by firms by assuming that wage payments are subject
to a cash-in-advance constraint of the form
mfit ≥ ν f wt hit ,

(19)

where mfit ≡ Mitf /Pt denotes the demand for real money balances by firm i in period t, Mitf
denotes nominal money holdings of firm i in period t, and ν f ≥ 0 is a parameter denoting
the fraction of the wage bill that must be backed with monetary assets.
Letting bond holdings of firm i in period t be denoted by Bitf , the period-by-period budget
constraint of firm i can be written as:
f
f
Mitf + Bitf = Mit−1
+ Rt−1 Bit−1
+ Pit ait − Pt ut kit − Pt wt hit − Pt φit .
f
f
We assume that the firm’s initial financial wealth is nil. That is, Mi,−1
+ R−1 Bi,−1
= 0.
Furthermore, we assume that the profit-distribution policy of firms is such that they hold

9

no financial wealth at the beginning of any period, or Mitf + Rt Bitf = 0 for all t. These
assumptions together with the above budget constraint imply that real profits of firm i at
date t expressed in terms of the composite good are given by:
φit ≡

Pit
ait − ut kit − wt hit − (1 − Rt−1 )mit .
Pt

(20)

Implicit in this specification of profits is the assumption that firms rent capital services from
a centralized market, which requires that this factor of production can be readily reallocated
across industries. This is the most common assumption in the related literature. A polar
assumption is that capital is sector specific, as in Woodford (2003) and Sveen and Weinke
(2003). Both assumptions are clearly extreme. A more realistic treatment of investment
dynamics would incorporate a mix of firm-specific and homogeneous capital.
We assume that the firm must satisfy demand at the posted price. Formally, we impose

(21)

The objective of the firm is to choose contingent plans for Pit , hit , kit and mfit to maximize
the present discounted value of profits, given by

Throughout our analysis, we will focus on equilibria featuring a strictly positive nominal
interest rate. This implies that the cash-in-advance constraint (19) will always be binding.
Then, letting dt,s Ps mcis be the Lagrange multiplier associated with constraint (21), the
first-order conditions of the firm’s maximization problem with respect to capital and labor
services are, respectively,


f Rt − 1

and
mcit zt Fk (kit , hit ) = ut .
Notice that because all firms face the same factor prices and because they all have access to
the same production technology with F homogeneous of degree one, the capital-labor ratio,
kit /hit and marginal cost, mcit , are identical across firms.
Prices are assumed to be sticky à la Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996). Specifically, each

10

period a fraction α ∈ [0, 1) of randomly picked firms is not allowed to change the nominal
price of the good it produces. We assume no indexation of prices. This assumption is in
line with the empirical evidence presented in Cogley and Sbordone (2004) and Levin et al..
(2005). The remaining (1 − α) firms choose prices optimally. Suppose firm i gets to choose
the price in period t, and let P̃it denote the chosen price. This price is set to maximize the
expected present discounted value of profits. That is, P̃it maximizes

According to this expression, firms whose price is free to adjust in the current period, pick a

marginal costs and marginal revenue equals zero.

Equilibrium and Aggregation

It is clear from optimality condition (22) that all firms that get to change their price in a
given period choose the same price. We thus drop the subscript i. The firm’s demands for
capital and labor aggregate to

(24)

and

As mentioned earlier, we restrict attention to equilibria in which the nominal interest rate
is strictly positive. This implies that the cash in advance constraints on firms and households
will always be binding. The sum of all firm-level cash-in-advance constraints holding with
equality yields the following aggregate relationship between real balances held by firms and

11

the wage bill:
mft = ν f wt ht .

(25)

Similarly, the aggregate demand for money by households satisfies
mht = ν h ct .

(26)

Total aggregate real balances are the sum of the demands for money by households and
firms:
mt = mht + mft

(27)

It is clear from the household’s optimality condition (10) and equation (13) that the
multiplier on the household’s cash-in-advance constraint ζt satisfies
ζt = 1 − Rt−1 .

(28)

From (4), it follows that the aggregate price index can be written as
1−η
+ (1 − α)P̃t1−η .
Pt1−η = αPt−1

Dividing this expression through by Pt1−η , one obtains
1 = απt−1+η + (1 − α)p̃1−η
,
t

(29)

where p̃t ≡ P̃t /Pt denotes the relative price of any good whose price was adjusted in period
t in terms of the composite good.
At this point, most of the related literature using the Calvo-Yun apparatus, proceeds
to linearizing equations (22) and (29) around a deterministic steady state featuring zero
inflation. This strategy yields the famous simple (linear) neo-Keynesian Phillips curve involving inflation and marginal costs (or the output gap). In the present study one cannot
follow this strategy for two reasons. First, we do not wish to restrict attention to the
case of zero long-run inflation. For price stability is neither optimal in the context of our
model, nor in line with historical evidence for industrialized countries. Second and more
importantly, we refrain from making the set of highly special assumptions that allow welfare
to be approximated accurately up to second order from a first-order approximation to the
equilibrium conditions. One of these assumptions is the existence of factor-input subsidies
financed by lump-sum taxes aimed at ensuring the perfectly competitive level of long-run
employment. Another friction that makes it inappropriate to use first-order approximations

to the equilibrium conditions for second-order-accurate welfare evaluation is the presence of
a transactional demand for money at the level of households or firms.
Our approach makes it necessary to retain the non-linear nature of the equilibrium conditions and in particular of equation (22). It is convenient to rewrite this expression in a
recursive fashion that does away with the use of infinite sums. To this end, we define two
new variables, x1t and x2t . Let

Naturally, the set of equilibrium conditions includes a resource constraint. Such a restriction is typically of the type zt F (kt , ht ) − χ = ct + it + gt . In the present model, however,
this restriction is not valid. This is because the model implies relative price dispersion across
varieties. This price dispersion, which is induced by the assumed nature of price stickiness, is
inefficient and entails output loss. To see this, start with equilibrium condition (21) stating

Three observations are in order about the dispersion measure st . First, st is bounded
below by 1.5 That is, price dispersion is always a costly distortion in this model. Second,
in an economy where the non-stochastic level of inflation is nil, i.e., when π = 1, up to first

order the variable st is deterministic and follows a univariate autoregressive process of the
form ŝt = αŝt−1 , where ŝt ≡ ln(st /s) denotes the log-deviation of st from its steady-state
value s. Thus, the underlying price dispersion, summarized by the variable st , has no real
consequences up to first order in the stationary distribution of other endogenous variables.
This means that studies that restrict attention to linear approximations to the equilibrium
conditions around a noninflationary steady-state are justified in ignoring the variable st . But
this variable must be taken into account if one is interested in higher-order approximations
to the equilibrium conditions or if one focuses on economies without long-run price stability
(π 6= 1) and imperfect long-run price indexation. Omitting st in higher-order expansions
would amount to leaving out certain higher-order terms while including others. Finally,
when prices are fully flexible, α = 0, we have that p̃t = 1 and thus st = 1. (Obviously, in a
flexible-price equilibrium there is no price dispersion across varieties.).

remain bounded in some neighborhood around the deterministic steady-state and satisfy
equations (7)-(9), (11)-(17), (23)-(35) and either τtL = 0 (in the absence of lump-sum taxation) or τtD = 0 (in the absence of distortionary taxation), given initial values for k0 , s−1 ,
and `−1 , and exogenous stochastic processes gt and zt .

Computation, Calibration, and Welfare Measure

We wish to find the monetary and fiscal policy rule combination (i.e., a value for απ , αy , αR ,
and γ1 ) that is optimal and implementable within the simple family defined by equations (16)
and (17). For a policy to be implementable, we impose three requirements: First, the rule
must ensure local uniqueness of the rational expectations equilibrium. Second, the rule
must induce nonnegative equilibrium dynamics for the nominal interest rate. Because we
approximate the solutioin to the equilibrium using perturbation methods, and because this
method is ill suited to handle nonnegativity constraints, we approximate the zero bound
constraint by requiring a low volatility of the nominal interest rate relative to its target value.
Specifically, we impoe the condition 2σR < R∗ , where σR denotes the unconditional standard
deviation of the nominal interest rate. Third, we limit attention to policy coefficients in the
interval [0, 3]. The size of this interval is arbitrary, but we feel that policy coefficients larger
than 3 or negative would be difficult to communicate to policymakers or the public. Most
of our results, however, are robust to expanding the size of the interval.
For an implementable policy to be optimal, the contingent plans for consumption and
hours of work associated with that policy must yield the highest level of unconditional lifetime
15

utility. Formally, we look for policy parameters that maximize E[Vt ], where
Vt ≡ Et

∞
X

β j U (ct+j , ht+j ).

j=0

and E denotes the unconditional expectations operator. Our results are robust to following
the alternative strategy of selecting policy parameters to maximize Vt itself, conditional
upon the initial state of the economy being the nonstochastic steady state (see SchmittGrohé and Uribe, 2004c). As a point of reference for policy evaluation we use the timeinvariant equilibrium processes of the Ramsey optimal allocation. We report conditional
and unconditional welfare costs of following the optimized simple policy rule relative to the
Ramsey polcy. Matlab code used to generate the results shown in the subsequent sections
are available on the authors’ websites.
Given the complexity of the economic environment we study in this paper, we are forced
to characterize an approximation to lifetime utility, Vt . Up to first-order accuracy, Vt is equal
to its non-stochastic steady-state value. Because all the monetary and fiscal policy regimes
we consider imply identical non-stochastic steady states, to a first-order approximation all of
those policies yield the same level of welfare. To determine the higher-order welfare effects
of alternative policies one must therefore approximate Vt to an order higher than one. For
an expansion of lifetime utility to be accurate up to second order, it is in general required
that the solution to the equilibrium conditions—the policy functions—also be accurate up
to second order. In particular, approximations to the policy functions based on a first-order
expansion of the equilibrium conditions would result in general in an incorrect second-order
approximation of the welfare criterion. In this paper, we compute second-order accurate
solutions to policy functions using the methodology and computer code of Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe (2004a).

3.1

Calibration and Functional Forms

To obtain the deep structural parameters of the model, we calibrate the model to the U.S.
economy, choosing the time unit to be one quarter. We assume that the economy is operating
in the deterministic steady state of a competitive equilibrium in which the inflation rate is
4.2 percent per annum, the average growth rate of the U.S. GDP deflator between 1960 and
1998. In addition, we assume that all government revenues originate in income taxation.
We require the share of government purchases in value added to be 17 percent in steady
state, which is in line with the observed U.S. postwar average. We impose a steady-state
debt-to-GDP ratio of 44 percent per year. This value corresponds to the average federal
16

debt held by the public as a percent of GDP in the United States between 1984 and 2003.6
We assume that the period utility function is given by
U (c, h) =

[c(1 − h)γ ]1−σ − 1
.
1−σ

(36)

We set σ = 2, so that the intertemporal elasticity of consumption, holding constant hours
worked, is 0.5. This value of σ falls well within the range of values used in the business-cycle
literature.
The production function excluding fixed costs, F , is assumed to be of the Cobb-Douglas
type
F (k, h) = k θ h1−θ ,
where θ describes the cost share of capital. We set θ equal to 0.3, which is consistent with
the empirical regularity that in the U.S. economy wages represent about 70 percent of total
cost.
The capital adjustment cost function is parameterized as follows:
Ψ(x) = 1 −

ψ
(x − 1)2 ,
2

where ψ is a positive constant. The baseline model features no adjustment costs, ψ = 0. We
also study the sensitivity of our results to the introduction of adjustment costs. In that case,
we draw on the work of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) and set ψ equal to 2.48.
We assign a value of 0.9902 to the subjective discount factor β, which is consistent with
an annual real rate of interest of 4 percent (Prescott, 1986). We set η, the price elasticity
of demand, so that in steady state the value added markup of prices over marginal cost is
25 percent (see Basu and Fernald, 1997). The annual depreciation rate is taken to be 10
percent, a value typically used in business-cycle studies.
Based on the observations that in the U.S. two thirds of M1 are held by firms (Mulligan,
1997) and that M1 was on average about 17 percent of annual GDP over the period 1960 to
1999, we calibrate the ratio of working capital to quarterly GDP to 0.45(= 0.17 × 2/3 × 4).
This parameterization implies that ν f = 0.63, which means that firms maintain 63 percent
of their wage bill in cash, and that ν h = 0.35, which implies that households hold money
balances equivalent to 35 percent of their quarterly consumption.
We assign a value of 0.8 to α, the fraction of firms that cannot change their price in any
given quarter. This value implies that on average firms change prices every 5 quarters, which
is consistent with empirical estimates of tα that assume a rental market for physical capital,

as we do in this paper (see, for example, Altig et al., 2005). We set the preference parameter
γ so that in the deterministic steady state of the competitive equilibrium households allocate
on average 20 percent of their time to work, as is the case in the U.S. economy according to
Prescott (1986).
The driving forces gt and zt are parameterized as in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2006).
Government purchases are assumed to follow a univariate autoregressive process of the form
ln(gt /ḡ) = ρg ln(gt−1 /ḡ) + gt ,
where ḡ is a constant. The first-order autocorrelation, ρg , is set to 0.87 and the standard
deviation of gt to 0.016. Productivity shocks are also assumed to follow a univariate autoregressive process
ln zt = ρz ln zt−1 + zt ,
where ρz = 0.856 and the standard deviation of zt is 0.0064. Finally, we set the fixed
cost parameter χ to ensure zero profits in the deterministic steady state of the competitive
equilibrium. Table 1 presents the deep structural parameter values implied by our calibration
strategy.

Measuring Welfare Costs

We conduct policy evaluations by computing the welfare cost of a particular monetary and
fiscal regime relative to the time-invariant equilibrium process associated with the Ramsey
policy. Consider the Ramsey policy, denoted by r, and an alternative policy regime, denoted
by a. We define the welfare associated with the time-invariant equilibrium implied by the
Ramsey policy conditional on a particular state of the economy in period 0 as
V0r = E0

∞
X

β t U (crt , hrt ),

t=0

where crt and hrt denote the contingent plans for consumption and hours under the Ramsey
policy. Similarly, define the conditional welfare associated with policy regime a as
V0a

= E0

∞
X

β t U (cat , hat ).

t=0

We assume that at time zero all state variables of the economy equal their respective Ramseysteady-state values. Because the non-stochastic steady state is the same across all policy
regimes we consider, computing expected welfare conditional on the initial state being the
nonstochastic steady state ensures that the economy begins from the same initial point under
all possible polices.7
Let λc denote the welfare cost of adopting policy regime a instead of the Ramsey policy
conditional on a particular state in period zero. We define λc as the fraction of regime r’s
consumption process that a household would be willing to give up to be as well off under
regime a as under regime r. Formally, λc is implicitly defined by
V0a

= E0

∞
X

β t U ((1 − λc)crt , hrt ).

t=0

For the particular functional form for the period utility function given in equation (36), the
7
It is of interest to investigate the robustness of our results with respect to alternative initial conditions.
For, in principle, the welfare ranking of the alternative polices will depend upon the assumed value for (or
distribution of) the initial state vector. In an earlier version of this paper (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004c),
we conduct policy evaluations conditional on an initial state different from the Ramsey steady state and
obtain similar results to those presented in this paper.



(1 − σ)V0a + (1 − β)−1
(1 − σ)V0r + (1 − β)−1

1/(1−σ) #

.

Given that we compute V0a and V0r accurately up to second-order, we restrict attention to
an approximation of λc that is accurate up to second order and omits all terms of order
higher than two. In equilibrium, V0a and V0r are functions of the initial state vector x0 and
the parameter σ scaling the standard deviation of the exogenous shocks (see Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe, 2004a). Therefore, we can write V0a = V ac (x0 , σ) and V0r = V rc(x0 , σ ). And the
conditional welfare cost can be expressed as
"

λc = 1 −

(37)

It is clear from this expression that λc is a function of x0 and σ , which we write as
λc = Λc (x0 , σ).
Consider a second-order approximation of the function Λc around the point x0 = x and
σ = 0, where x denotes the deterministic Ramsey steady state of the state vector. Because
we wish to characterize welfare conditional upon the initial state being the deterministic
Ramsey steady state, in performing the second-order expansion of Λc only its first and
second derivatives with respect to σ have to be considered. Formally, we have

λ ≈ Λ (x, 0) +

Because the deterministic steady-state level of welfare is the same across all monetary policies
belonging to the class defined in equation (17), it follows that λc vanishes at the point
(x0 , σ ) = (x, 0). Formally,
Λc (x, 0) = 0.

20

Totally differentiating equation (37) with respect to σ , evaluating the result at (x0 , σ) =
(x, 0), and using the result derived in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2004a) that the first
derivatives of the policy functions with respect to σ evaluated at (x0 , σ ) = (x, 0) are nil
(Vσac = Vσrc = 0), it follows immediately that
Λcσ (x, 0) = 0.
Now totally differentiating (37) twice with respect to σ and evaluating the result at (x0 , σ ) =
(x, 0) yields
Vσrc σ (x, 0) − Vσac
(x, 0)
 σ
.
Λcσ σ (x, 0) =

(1 − σ)V (x, 0) + (1 − β)−1
Thus, the conditional welfare cost measure is given by

(1 − σ)V rc(x, 0) + (1 − β)−1 2

(38)

Similarly, one can derive an unconditional welfare cost measure, which we denote by λu .

λu ≈

A Cashless Economy

Consider a nonmonetary economy. Specifically, eliminate the cash-in-advance constraints on
households and firms by setting
νh = νf = 0
in equations (5) and (19). The fiscal authority is assumed to have access to lump-sum taxes
and to follow a passive fiscal policy. That is, the fiscal policy rule is given by equations (15)
and (16) with
γ1 ∈ (0, 2/π ∗ ) and τtD = 0.
This economy is of interest for it most resembles the canonical neokeynesian model studied
in the related literature on optimal policy (see Clarida, Galı́, and Gertler, 1999, and the
references cited therein). This body of work studies optimal monetary policy in the context
of a cashless economy with nominal rigidities and no fiscal authority. For analytical purposes,
the absence of a fiscal authority is equivalent to modeling a government that operates under
21

passive fiscal policy and collects all of its revenue via lump-sum taxation. We wish to
highlight, however, two important differences between the economy studied here and the
one typically considered in the related literature. Namely, in our economy there is capital
accumulation and no subsidy to factor inputs aimed at offsetting the distortions arising from
monopolistic competition. The latter difference is of consequence for the solution method
that can be applied to the optimal policy problem. Without the ad-hoc subsidy scheme,
first-order approximations to the policy functions are not sufficient to deliver a second-order
accurate approximation to the utility function. One must approximate the policy functions
up to second order to obtain a second-order accurate approximation to the level of welfare.
Panel A of table 2 reports policy evaluations for the cashless economy. The point of
comparison for our policy evaluation is the time-invariant stochastic real allocation associated
with the Ramsey policy. The table reports conditional and unconditional welfare costs, λc
and λu , as defined in equations (38) and (39). Under the Ramsey policy inflation is virtually
equal to zero at all times.8 One may wonder why in an economy featuring sticky prices
as the single nominal friction, the volatility of inflation is not exactly equal to zero at all
times under the Ramsey policy. The reason is that we do not follow the standard practice of
subsidizing factor inputs to eliminate the distortion introduced by monopolistic competition
in product markets. Introducing such a subsidy would result in a constant Ramsey-optimal
rate of inflation equal to zero.9
We consider seven different monetary policies: Four constrained optimal interest-rate
feedback rules and three non-optimized rules. In the constrained optimal rule labeled nosmoothing, we search over the policy coefficients απ and αy keeping αR fixed at zero. The
second constrained-optimal rule, labeled smoothing in the table, allows for interest-rate
inertia by setting optimally all three coefficients, απ , αy and αR .
We find that the best no-smoothing interest-rate rule calls for an aggressive response to
inflation and a mute response to output. The inflation coefficient of the optimized rule takes
the largest value allowed in our search, namely 3.10 The optimized rule is quite effective as
it delivers welfare levels remarkably close to those achieved under the Ramsey policy. At the
same time, the rule induces a stable rate of inflation, a feature that also characterizes the
8

In the deterministic steady state of the Ramsey economy, the inflation rate is zero.
Formally, one can show that setting τtD = 1/(1 − η) and πt = 1 for all t ≥ 0 and eliminating the
depreciation allowance the equilibrium conditions collapse to those associated with the flexible-price, perfectcompetition version of the model. Because the real allocation implied by the latter model is Pareto efficient,
it follows that setting πt = 1 at all times must be Ramsey-optimal in the economy with sticky prices and
factor subsidies.
10
Removing the upper bound on policy parameters optimal policy calls for a much larger inflation coefficient, a zero output coefficient and yields a negligible improvement in welfare. The unconstrained policy-rule
coefficients are απ = 332 and αy = 0. The associated welfare gain is about one thousandth of one percent of
consumption conditionally and unconditionally.

Notes: (1) In the optimized rules, the policy parameters απ , αy , and αR are restricted
to lie in the interval [0, 3]. (2) Conditional and unconditional welfare costs, λc ×100 and
λu × 100, are defined as the percentage decrease in the Ramsey optimal consumption
process necessary to make the level of welfare under the Ramsey policy identical to
that under the evaluated policy. Thus, a positive figure indicates that welfare is higher
under the Ramsey policy than under the alternative policy. (3) The standard deviation
of inflation and the nominal interest rate is measured in percent per year.

Ramsey policy.
We next study a case in which the central bank can smooth interest rates over time.
Our numerical search yields that the optimal policy coefficients are απ = 3, αy = 0.01, and
αR = 0.84. The fact that the optimized rule features substantial interest-rate inertia means
that the monetary authority reacts to inflation much more aggressively in the long run than
in the short run. The fact that the interest rule is not superinertial (i.e., αR does not exceed
unity) means that the monetary authority is backward looking. So, again, as in the case
without smoothing optimal policy calls for a large response to inflation deviations in order to
stabilize the inflation rate and for no response to deviations of output from the steady state.
The welfare gain of allowing for interest-rate smoothing is insignificant. Taking the difference
between the welfare costs associated with the optimized rules with and without interest-rate
smoothing reveals that agents would be willing to give up less than 0.001 percent, that is,less
than 1 one-thousandth of one percent, of their consumption stream under the optimized rule
with smoothing to be as well off as under the optimized policy without smoothing.
The finding that allowing for optimal smoothing yields only negligible welfare gains spurs
us to investigate whether rules featuring suboptimal degrees of inertia or responsiveness to
inflation can produce nonnegligible welfare losses at all. Figure 1 shows that provided the
central bank does not respond to output, αy = 0, varying απ and αR between 0 and 3
typically leads to economically negligible welfare losses of less than five one-hundredths of
one percent of consumption. The graph shows with crosses combinations of απ and αR
that are implementable and with circles combinations that are implementable and that yield
welfare costs less than 0.05 percent of consumption relative to the Ramsey policy.
The blank area in the figure identifies απ and αR combinations that are not implementable
either because the equilibrium fails to be locally unique or because the implied volatility of
interest rates is too high. This is the case for values of απ and αR such that the policy stance is
απ
passive in the long run, that is 1−α
< 1. For these parameter combinations the equilibrium
R
is not locally unique. This finding is a generalization of the result, that when the inflation
coefficient is less than unity (απ < 1) the equilibrium is indeterminate, which obtains in
the absence of interest-rate smoothing (αR = 0). We also note that the result that passive
interest-rate rules (together with passive fiscal policy) renders the equilibrium indeterminate
is typically derived in the context of models that abstract from capital accumulation. It is
therefore reassuring that this particular abstraction appears to be of no consequence for the
finding that (long-run) passive policy is inconsistent with local uniqueness of the rational
expectations equilibrium. Similarly, we find that determinacy obtains for policies that are
απ
active in the long run, 1−α
> 1.

More importantly, figure 1 shows that virtually all parameterizations of the interest-rate

feedback rule that are implementable yield virtually the same level of welfare as the Ramsey
equilibrium. This finding suggests a simple policy prescription, namely, that any policy
parameter combination that is irresponsive to output and active in the long run is equally
desirable from a welfare point of view.
One possible reaction to the finding that implementability-preserving variations in απ
and αR have little welfare consequences may be that in the class of models we consider
welfare is flat in a large neighborhood around the optimum parameter configuration, so that
it does not really matter what the government does. This turns out not to be the case in
the economy studied here. Recall that in the welfare calculations underlying figure 1 the
response coefficient on output, αy , was kept constant and equal to zero. Indeed, as we show
in the next subsection, interest-rate policy rules that lean against the wind by raising the
nominal interest rate when output is above trend can be associated with sizable welfare costs.

4.1

The importance of not responding to output

Figure 2 illustrates the consequences of introducing a cyclical component to the interest-rate
rule. It shows that the welfare costs of varying αy can be large, thereby underlining the
importance of not responding to output. The figure shows the welfare cost of deviating
from the optimal output coefficient (αy ≈ 0) while keeping the remaining two coefficients
of the interest-rate rule at their optimal values (απ = 3 and αR = 0.84). Welfare costs are
monotonically increasing in αy . When αy = 1, the welfare cost is over two tenths of one
percent of the consumption stream associated with the Ramsey policy. This is a significant
figure in the realm of policy evaluation at business-cycle frequency. This finding suggest
that bad policy can have significant welfare costs in our model and that policy mistakes are
committed when policy makers are unable to resist the temptation to respond to output
fluctuations.
It follows that sound monetary policy calls for sticking to the basics of responding to inflation alone.11 This point is conveyed with remarkable simplicity by comparing the welfare
consequences of a simple interest-rate rule that responds only to inflation with a coefficient
of 1.5 to those of a standard Taylor rule that responds to inflation as well as output with
coefficients 1.5 and 0.5, respectively. Panel A of table 2 shows that the Taylor rule that
responds to output is significantly welfare inferior to the simple interest-rate rule that responds solely to inflation. Specifically, the welfare cost of responding to output is about half
a percentage point of consumption.12
11

Other authors have also argued that countercyclical interest-rate policy may be undesirable (e.g., Ireland,
1996; and Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997).

The simple interest-rate rule that responds solely to inflation is implementable, whereas the standard

A question that emerges naturally from our forgoing results is why cyclical monetary
policy is so disruptive. An intuition often offered for why a policy of leaning against the
wind is not appropriate in response to supply shocks such as a technology shock, is that
under leaning against the wind the nominal interest rate rises whenever output rises. This
increase in the nominal interest rate in turn hinders prices falling by as much as marginal
costs causing markups to increase. With an increase in markups, output does not increase
as much as it would have otherwise, preventing the efficient rise in output (see, for example,
Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997). This explanation requires that in response to a positive
supply shock, the central bank raises the nominal interest by more (or lowers it by less) in
the case that αy is positive as compared to the case in which αy is nil. But this is not what
happens in the class of sticky-price models to which ours belongs.
Figure 3 depicts the response of a number of endogenous variables of interest to a onepercent increase in the exogenous productivity factor zt . The figure displays impulse response
functions associated with two alternative values for the output coefficient in the interest-rate
rule, the one called for by the optimized rule (αy = 0) and a positive one (αy = 0.5). In
response to the positive productivity shock, the nominal interest rate increases in the case of
an acyclical monetary stance, but falls when the central bank leans against the wind. This
implication of the model may appear as surprising at first. For one would be inclined to
expect that introduction of a procyclical component into the interest rate rule would induce
a stronger positive response of the nominal interest rate to a positive supply shock. But
further inspection of the structure of the model reveals that the intuition is indeed more
subtle. The dynamics of inflation in this model are driven primarily by the Fisher effect
(i.e., the interest rate is the sum of expected future inflation and the real interest rate)
and the interest rate rule, linking the interest rate to current inflation and output. A simple
flexible price example will suffice to gather intuition for the equilibrium dynamics of inflation.
Consider an endowment economy where output follows a univariate autoregressive process of
the form Et ŷt+1 = ρŷt with ρ ∈ (0, 1). All variables are expressed in log-deviations from their
respective deterministic-steady-state values. In equilibrium, the Euler equation that prices
riskless nominal bonds (or Fisher equation) is of the form −σ ŷt = R̂t − Et π̂t+1 − σEt ŷt+1 ,
where σ measures the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. The interest-rate rule is of
the form R̂t = απ π̂t + αy ŷt , with απ > 1. The non-explosive solution to this system of
stochastic linear difference equations is π̂t = Dπ ŷt where Dπ ≡ [σ(1 − ρ) + αy ]/(ρ − απ ) < 0
and R̂t = DR ŷt , where DR = [απ σ(1 − ρ) + αy ρ]/(ρ − απ ) < 0. Note that as output becomes
highly persistent (ρ → 1), we have that both Dπ and DR converge to αy /(1 − απ ). In this
case we have that a positive output innovation produces a negative response of inflation and
Taylor rule is not, because it implies too high a volatility of nominal interest rates.

Note: The feedback rule coefficients are απ = 3, αy = 0 or 0.5, and αR = 0.84. For
all variables with the exception of the inflation rate and the nominal interest rate, the
impulse responses are shown in percent deviations from the steady state. For inflation
and the nominal interest rate, deviations from steady state in percentage points, rather
than percent deviations, are shown.

29

the interest rate when the Fed has a countercyclical stance (αy > 0), but has no effect on the
equilibrium level of these variables when monetary policy is acyclical (αy = 0). Moreover,
the decline in inflation and interest rates are larger the greater is the output coefficient of the
interest-rate feedback rule. Table 2 confirms this conjecture. It shows that in our sticky-price
model the standard deviation of inflation falls from 3.1 percent per annum to 0.6 percent
as αy decreases from 0.5 to zero. In the presence of nominal rigidities, inflation volatility
entails a welfare cost because it generates inefficient price dispersion.
Having established why when αy is positive inflation falls in response to positive productivity shocks, one can understand why responding to output is costly from a welfare point of
view. Those firms that get to change prices when the productivity shock occurs will tend to
keep their markup close to its long-run mean.13 In addition, the fact that inflation falls on
impact requires that firms that change prices in that period actually lower nominal prices.
This implies that the relative price of firms that get to change prices, P̃t /Pt , falls. Since
markups for these firms are little change, we deduce that real marginal costs fall. Now, since
real marginal costs are common across all firms, the markup of firms who do not have the
chance to change prices must go up. It follows that the average markup in the economy
increases, as indicated by the lower-left panel of figure 3.14 The increase in markups produces an inefficient macroeconomic adjustment in response to the productivity shock, which
is welfare reducing.

4.2

Inflation Targeting

The Ramsey-optimal monetary policy implies near complete inflation stabilization (see panel
A of table 2). It is reasonable to conjecture, therefore, that inflation targeting, interpreted to
be any monetary policy capable of bringing about zero inflation at all times (πt = 1 for all t),
would induce business cycles virtually identical to those associated with the Ramsey policy.
We confirm this conjecture by computing the welfare cost associated with inflation targeting.
The unconditional welfare cost of targeting inflation relative to the Ramsey policy is virtually
nil. Curiously, conditional on the initial state being the deterministic Ramsey steady state,
inflation targeting welfare dominates the Ramsey policy albeit by an insignificant amount.
13

Note that equation (22) implies that in their price setting behavior these firms penalize more heavily
deviations of markups from η/(η − 1) in the short run because demand is highest during this part of the
transition.

or µ̂t = −m̂ct .

30

This result can be understood by the fact that the Ramsey policy maximizes welfare along
a time-invariant equilibrium distribution.

4.3

Backward- and Forward-Looking Interest-Rate Rules

An important issue in monetary policy is what measures of inflation and aggregate activity
the central bank should respond to. In particular, a question that has received considerable
attention among academic economists and policymakers is whether the monetary authority
should respond to past, current, or expected future values of output and inflation. Here
we address this question by computing optimal backward- and forward-looking interest-rate
rules. That is, in equation (17) we let i take the values −1 and +1. Panel A of table 2 shows
that there are no welfare gains from targeting expected future values of inflation and output
as opposed to current or lagged values of these macroeconomic indicators. Also a muted
response to output continues to be optimal under backward- and forward-looking rules.
Under a forward-looking rule without smoothing (αR = 0), the rational expectations
equilibrium is indeterminate for all values of the inflation and output coefficients in the
interval [0,3]. This result is in line with that obtained by Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005).
These authors consider an environment similar to ours and characterize determinacy of
equilibrium for interest-rate rules that depend only on the rate of inflation. Our results
extends the findings of Carlstrom and Fuerst to the case in which output enters in the
feedback rule.15

5

A Monetary Economy

We next introduce money into the model by assuming that the parameters ν h and ν f governing the demands for money by households and firms take their baseline values of 0.35 and
0.63, respectively. All other aspects of the model, including the fiscal policy specification,
are as in the cashless economy analyzed in the preceeding section.
In this model there exists a tradeoff between inflation stabilization, aimed at neutralizing the distortions stemming from sluggish price adjustment, and nominal interest rate
stabilization, aimed at dampening the distortions introduced by the two monetary frictions.
Movements in the opportunity cost of holding money distort both the effective wage rate,
via the working-capital constraint faced by firms, and the leisure-consumption margin, via
the cash-in-advance constraint faced by households. We find, however, that this tradeoff is
15

Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005) comment that including output in the interest rate rule would have minor
effects on local determinacy conditions (see their footnote 4).

31

not quantitatively important (see panel B of table 2). The Ramsey monetary policy calls for
the same degrees of inflation and nominal-interest-rate volatilities as in the cashless economy.16 Furthermore, the welfare-maximizing interest-rate rules, with and without interestrate smoothing, are virtually identical to those obtained in the cashless economy. That is,
απ takes the largest value allowed in our grid, 3, the output coefficient αy is practically
nil, and the the interest-rate smoothing parameter is signigicant, αR = 0.8. The optimized
interest-rate rule, with or without inertia, gets remarkably close to the level of welfare associated with the Ramsey allocation. The welfare cost in both cases are economically negligible.
Therefore, the welfare gain of allowing for interest-rate smoothing is insignificant.
As in the cashless economy, welfare is quite insensitive to the precise magnitude of the
inflation and interest-rate-smoothing coefficients provided that the output coefficient is held
at zero. This point is clearly communicated by figure 4, which shows with crosses the pairs
(απ , αR ) for which the equilibrium is implementable and with circles the pairs for which
the equilibrium is implementable and welfare costs vis-a-vis the Ramsey equilibrium are less
than 0.05 percent of consumption.. In the figure, the output coefficient αy is fixed at zero.
Most of the implementable policy parameterizations yield welfare levels remarkable close to
that implied by the Ramsey policy.
A further similarity with the cashless economy is that positive values of the output
response coefficient of the interest-rate rule, αy , continue to be associated with nonnegligible
welfare losses. Figure 5 plots unconditional welfare losses as a function of αy , holding the
inflation and lagged-interest-rate coefficients at their optimal values of 3 and 0.8, respectively.
The welfare cost increaes monotonically as αy increases from 0 to 0.7. Beyond this value,
the equilibrium ceases to be implementable.

5.1

Difference Rules

In motivating the interest-rate rule (17), which we have been studying thus far, we argued
that it demands little sophistication on the part of the policymaker, because the variables
involved are few and easily observable. However, one might argue that because the variables
included in the rule are expressed in deviations from their nonstochastic steady state, implementation requires knowledge of the deterministic steady state. The nonstochastic steady
state is, however, nonobservable. Thus, the assumed rule presupposes a degree of knowledge
that central bankers may not posses. Earlier in this section we also addressed the issue that
16
The Ramsey-steady-state inflation rate is -0.55 percent per year, slightly lower than the zero steady-state
inflation rate that is optimal in the cashless economy. In the Ramsey steady state there is a tradeoff in the
levels of inflation (which should be nil to avoid distortions stemmings from price rigidity) and the nominal
interest rate (which should be zero as called for by the Friedman rule). This tradeoff is resolved in favor of
near price stability.

the central banks may not have information on variables such as output and inflation on a
contemporaneous basis. A way to avoid these problems is to postulate a rule that includes
lagged values of time differences in prices, aggregate activity, and interest rates, as opposed
to simply the contemporaneous levels of such variables. Such a rule is given in equation (18).
Note that besides the policy coefficients αR , απ and αy , the only parameter required for implementing this rule is the inflation target π ∗ , which is a choice for the central bank. Also,
changes in prices and output appear with one period lag. In this way, the proposed rule is
simpler than the one studied thus far. Within the family of difference rules, we find that the
welfare-maximizing one is given by
ln(Rt /Rt−1 ) = 0.77 ln(Rt−1 /Rt−2 ) + 0.75 ln(πt−1 /π ∗ ) + 0.02 ln(yt−1 /yt−2 ).
This rule is similar in spirit to the optimal policy rule in levels. In effect, optimal policy
calls for interest-rate smoothing and a mute response to output growth. The difference rule
induces remarkably smooth inflation dynamics, with a standard deviation of 6 basis points
at an annual rate. Furthermore, the optimal difference rule yields virtually the same level
of welfare as does the optimal level rule. Eliminating the interest-rate smoothing term by
restricting αR = 0 has negligible welfare consequences. Thus, as in under the level rule,
interest-rate smoothing is unimportant from a welfare point of view.
We conclude that in the context of our model knowledge on the part of the central bank
of past values of inflation and output growth provide sufficient information to implement a
real allocation that is virtually identical in welfare terms to that associated with the Ramsey
policy. This result is significant in light of the emphasis that the related literature places
on rules that respond to unobservable measures of the output gap—typically defined as the
difference between output under sticky and flexible prices.

An Economy With A Fiscal Feedback Rule

Thus far, we have restricted attention to the case of passive fiscal policy. Under passive
fiscal policy, government solvency obtains for all possible paths of the price level or other
macroeconomic variables. This type of fiscal-policy regime is the one typically assumed in the
related literature. But it is worthwhile asking whether from a welfare point of view a passive
fiscal policy stance is desirable. Moreover, even if it turns out that optimal policy calls for
a passive fiscal regime, it is of interest to know how close one can get to the level of welfare
associated with the optimized monetary and fiscal rules when fiscal policy is restricted to be
active. For these reasons, in this section we study a simple fiscal policy rule that allows for

35

the possibility that fiscal policy be either active or passive. We first analyze an environment
with lump-sum taxes and then turn attention to the case of distortionary income taxation.

6.1

Lump-Sum Taxation

Suppose that fiscal policy is defined by equations (15) and (16) with τtD = 0 for all t.
Combining this fiscal policy fiscal policy with the government sequential budget constraint,
given by equation (14), one obtains `t = Rt /πt (1 − πt γ1 )`t−1 + rest. Loosely speaking, this
expression states that the feedback parameter γ1 controls the rate of growth of total real
government liabilities. If 1 − γ1 π ∗ is less than one in absolute value, then real government
liabilities tend to grow at a rate less than the real rate of interest. In this case, fiscal solvency
is guaranteed regardless of the stance of monetary policy and fiscal concerns play no role
for the determinacy of the price level. In this case, we say that fiscal policy is passive.
On the other hand, if 1 − γ1 π ∗ is greater than unity in absolute value, then the size of
government liabilities will in general tend to grow at a rate greater than the real interest
rate in absolute value. In this case, existence of a stationary equilibrium—one in which the
present discounted value of future expected real government liabilities converges to zero—
requires that the initial price level adjust to a value that is consistent with a bounded path
for government liabilities. This would be an example of an active fiscal policy.
We find that the optimal monetary/fiscal rule combination without smoothing (αR = 0)
features an active monetary stance and a passive fiscal stance. The optimal coefficients are
απ = 3, αy = 0.002, and any γ1 ∈ [0.1, 1.9]. The fact that passive fiscal policy is optimal
implies that all of the results of the previous section follow. In particular, the rule delivers
virtually the same level of welfare as the Ramsey optimal policy, responding to output entails
sizable welfare costs, and interest-rate smoothing adds insignificant welfare gains.
The intuition for why the optimal monetary and fiscal rule combination features passive
fiscal and active monetary policy as opposed to active fiscal and passive monetary policy
is the following. Recall that this is an economy in which the government has access to
lump-sum taxation. Thus, any fiscal policy that ensures solvency using lump-sum taxes
is nondistorting. This is the case under passive fiscal policy. If government liabilities are,
say, above their target level, then lump-sum taxes are increased and with time government
liabilities return to their long-run level. A rather different strategy for bringing about fiscal
solvency is to use unexpected variations in the price level as a lump-sum tax/subsidy on
nominal asset holdings of private households. This is what happens under active fiscal
policy. For example, consider the simple case in which γ1 = 0, so that primary fiscal deficits
are exogenous, and απ = αy = 0, so that monetary policy is passive (taking the form of

an interest-rate peg). The only way in which fiscal solvency can be brought about in this
case is through variations in the real value of government liabilities, which in turn require
(unexpected) adjustments in the price level. In the economy under study movements in the
price level increase the distortions stemming from the presence of nominal rigidities. This is
why the strategy of reigning in government finances with surprise inflation is suboptimal.
We now address the question of how costly it is, from a welfare point of view, to follow
an active fiscal stance. Figure 6 shows with crosses the (απ , γ1 ) pairs that are implementable
holding αy equal to zero. The equilibrium is implementable only for combinations of active
fiscal and passive monetary policy or passive fiscal and active monetary policy. It follows that
policy implementability requires coordination between the fiscal authority and the central
bank.
Figure 6 also shows that most policy combinations that are implementable yield almost
the same level of welfare as that associated with the Ramsey equilibrium. Specifically, the

37

figure shows with circles the pairs (απ ,γ1 ) implying welfare costs smaller than 0.05 percent of
consumption vis-a-vis the Ramsey allocation. Most of the parameter specifications for which
the equilibrium is implementable have a circle attached to them, indicating that agents are
only marginally better off under the Ramsey optimal rule. Notably, the figure shows that
there exist active fiscal policies yielding welfare costs below five one-hundreds of one percent.
This is the case, for instance, for a pure interest rate peg, απ = 0, and values of γ1 between
2 and 3. Given our intuition for why passive fiscal policy is optimal, this result is somewhat
surprising. The reason for why the welfare cost associated with active fiscal policy can be
small is that this type of policy need not imply high inflation volatility. In effect, the policy
combinations featuring active fiscal policy and low welfare costs shown in figure 6 display
inflation volatilities well below one percentage point per year. We note that implementable
policy combinations featuring γ1 = 0 are not circled in figure 6. This means that it is
important for welfare that fiscal policy allow for some response in taxes to deviations of
government liabilities from target.

6.2

Distortionary Taxation

Consider now the more realistic case in which lump sum taxes are unavailable and the fiscal
authority must levy distortionary income taxes to finance public expenditures. Specifically,
total tax receipts are assumed to be given by
τt = τtD yt .
We continue to use the Ramsey optimal policy as the point of reference to perform policy
evaluation. We require that in the nonstochastic steady state of the Ramsey equilibrium the
debt-to-GDP ratio be 44 percent annually. Given this restriction, the Ramsey steady state
implies an income tax rate, τ D , equal to 15.7 percent. As in the economy with lump-sum
taxation, the tradeoff between price stability, which minimizes distortions stemming from
price stickiness, and a zero nominal interest rate, which minimizes the opportunity cost of
holding money is resolved overwhelmingly in favor of price stability. In effect, the Ramsey
steady-state rate of inflaiton is -0.04 percent per year.17
We assume that the government commits to the fiscal and interest-rate rules given in
17
Although the focus of our study is not the welfare effects of distortionary taxation, it is worth pointing
out that the steady-state level of welfare under distortionary taxation is significantly below that associated
with the economy in which the fiscal authority has access to lump-sum taxes. For an agent to be indifferent
between living in the Ramsey steady state of the economy with distorting taxes and the one with lump-sum
taxes, not taking into account the transition, he must be forced to give up more than 7 percent of the
consumption stream that he enjoys in the lump-sum-tax world.

38

equations (16) and (17), respectively. The optimal policy rule combination without interestrate smoothing is given by
ln(Rt /R∗ ) = 3 ln(πt /π ∗ ) + 0.005 ln(yt /y ∗ )
and
τt − τ ∗ = 0.21(`t−1 − `∗ ).
The main characteristics of optimized policy in this economy are identical to those obtained
in the economy with lump-sum taxes: First, the optimized interest-rate rule features an
aggressive response to inflation and a muted response to output. Second, the optimized fiscal
rule is passive as tax revenues increase only mildly in response to increases in government
liabilities. Third, the optimized regime yields a level of welfare that is virtually identical
to that implied by the Ramsey optimal policy. The welfare cost of the optimized policy
relative to the Ramsey policy conditional on the initial state being the deterministic Ramsey
steady state is only 0.0029 percent of consumption per period.18 Finally, the optimized
rule stabilizes inflation. The standard deviation of inflation is 16 basis points per year. In
addition, optimal policy achieves a significant degree of tax-rate stabilization. The standard
deviation of the income tax rate is 0.7 percentage points.
As in the economies with lump-sum taxes, we find that interest-rate rules featuring a
large output coefficient can be disruptive from a welfare point of view. Figure 7 shows that
for values of αy between 0 and 0.5 welfare costs increase from virtually 0 to over 0.15 percent.
The latter figure is a sizable one as welfare costs at business-cycle frequency go. For values
of αy greater than 0.5, the policy rule ceases to be implementable.
A further similarity with the economy with lump-sum taxes is that although interestrate smoothing is optimal, its contribution to welfare is quantitatively unimportant. The
optimized rule with interest-rate smoothng is given by απ = 3, αy = 0.01, αR = 0.88, and
γ1 = 0.26. The conditional welfare gain relative to the optimized rule without smoothing is
0.0009 percent of consumption, which is economically negligible.
Unlike the economy with lump-sum taxes, the current environment with distortionary
taxation speaks louder in favor of pursuing an active monetary stance together with a passive
fiscal stance. Figure 8 shows with a cross the pairs (απ , γ1 ) that are implementable given αy =
0. Essentially, all rules featuring fiscally active and monetarily passive policy or vice versa are
implementable. This result is well known in the case of lump-sum taxation and flexible prices
(Leeper, 1991). Here, we show that this result extends to the case of distortionary taxation
18

We do not report unconditional welfare costs because the Ramsey dynamics feature a unit root, making
it impossible to compute unconditional moments.

and sticky prices. Figure 8 shows with circles implementable parameter pairs (απ , γ1 ) for
which the conditional welfare cost relative to the Ramsey policy is less than 0.05 percent
of consumption per period. Virtually all implementable regimes featuring active monetary
policy and passive fiscal policy (the southeast quarter of the plot) deliver conditional welfare
levels that are insignificantly different from that implied by the Ramsey policy. By contrast,
all of the implementable regimes featuring passive monetary policy and active fiscal policy
have welfare costs exceeding 0.05 percent.

Conclusion

In this paper we evaluate the stabilizing properties of simple monetary and fiscal rules. Our
measure of stabilization is given by the level of welfare of private agents. By simple rules we
mean ones where policy variables such as the nominal interest rates, and taxes are set as a
function of a few number of observable aggregates such as output, inflation, and government
debt. We further restrict our rules to be implementable by requiring that they be associated
with a unique rational expectations equilibrium and infrequent violations of the zero lower
bound on nominal interest rates.
Within the class of simple and implementable rules, we find that: first, welfare is virtually
insensitive to changes in the inflation coefficient in the interest-rate feedback rule. Second,
interest-rate feedback rules that respond to output can be significantly harmful. Third,
the optimal fiscal-policy stance is passive. Fourth, although the optimized interest-rate
rule features signigicant interest-rate smoothing, the welfare gains associated therewith are
negligible. Finally, the optimized simple monetary and fiscal rules attain virtually the same
level of welfare as the Ramsey optimal policy.
The theoretical model and methodology we employ improves upon the existing literature
by including simultaneously all of the following elements: (a) sluggish price adjustment;
(b) capital accumulation; (c) no subsidies aimed at eliminating the long-run distortions
introduced by imperfect competition; (d) nonzero long-run inflation; (e) welfare evaluation
based upon a second-order accurate solution to the equilibrium behavior of endogenous
variables; (f) joint evalutation of monetary as well as fiscal stabilization policy; and (g)
policy evaluations using the Ramsey optimal allocation as the point of reference.
But the model studied in this paper leaves out a number of features that have been
identified as potentially important for understanding business fluctuations. Recent empirical
work suggests that nominal wage stickiness, and real frictions such as habit formation, capital
adjustment costs, and variable capacity utilization are important in improving the ability of
macroeconomic models to explain U.S. business cycles. In Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2005,
42

2006), we take up the task of identifying optimal simple and implementable rules in the
context of larger estimated models of the U.S. business cycle.

This appendix derives the steady state of the competitive equilibrium as well as the long-run
restrictions used for calibration. A box around an equation indicates that the variable on
the left-hand side has been expresed as a function of known structural parameters (directly,
or indirectly via earlier expressions in boxes). Numbers next to boxes indicate the order
in which the boxed equations must be written in a matlab program in order to obtain the
steady state.

This system contains 19 equations with 21 variables: i, h, k, c, λ, R, w, τ D , u, π, `, g, τ , m,
τ L , y, mc, p̃, x1 , x2 , and s.
The monetary/fiscal regime is such that in steady state the variables π and ` are determined as follows:
π = 1.0421/4

The steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio, b/y is 44 percent of annual GDP. The definition ` =

In addition, the system contains 11 structural parameters: δ, σ, γ, ν h , β, θ, ν f , α, η, χ, and

Finally, we need to find values for `, τ , and τ L .
• Consider first the case that τ D = 0, and all taxes are lump sum. It follows that

Then, use the calibration restriction that the government debt to gdp ratio is 44 percent.

Now solve the sequential budget constraint of the government, equation (14), for τ
