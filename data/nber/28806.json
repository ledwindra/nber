    "abstract": "\n\nThe \u201cdebt-overhang hypothesis\u201d \u2013 that households cut back more on their spending in a crisis when they have higher levels of outstanding mortgage debt (Dynan, 2012) \u2013 seems to be taken for granted by macroprudential authorities in several countries in their policy decisions, as well as by the international organizations that evaluate and comment on countries\u2019 macroprudential policy. Results are presented for UK microdata that reject the debt-overhang hypothesis. The results instead support the \u201cspending-normalization hypothesis\u201d of Andersen, Duus, and Jensen (2016a), what can also be called the \u201cdebt-financed overspending\u201d hypothesis \u2013 that the correlation between high pre-crisis household indebtedness and subsequent spending cuts  during the crisis reflects high debt-financed spending pre-crisis and a return to normal spending during the crisis. As discussed in Svensson (2019, 2020), this is consistent with the correlation reflecting debt-financed overspending through what Muellbauer (2012) calls the \u201chousing-collateral household demand\u201d and Mian and Sufi (2018) the \u201ccredit-driven household demand\u201d channel. The correlation is thus spurious and an example of omitted-variable bias. A simple model shows that consumption and debt changes are directly and strongly positively correlated, whereas consumption and debt levels are quite weakly negatively correlated. Importantly, and in contrast, examples show that there is no systematic relation between consumption cuts and levels of or changes in LTV ratios. The lack of a robust relation between consumption cuts and levels of or changes in LTV ratios implies that tests of these hypotheses should generally not be done by regressions of consumption cuts on levels of or changes in LTV ratios.\n\n",
