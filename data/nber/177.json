    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper considers the formulation and estimation of simultaneous equation models with both discrete and continuous endogenous variables. The statistical model proposed here is sufficiently rich to encompass the classical simultaneous equation model for continuous endogenous variables and more recent models for purely discrete endogenous variables as special cases of a more general model.\n\n",

Bahadur, Linda Edwards Zvi Griliches, Tom MaCurdy, Marc Nerlove, Randy Olsen, Donald Sant, Peter Schmidt and Arnold Zellner all made valuable comments on drafts of this paper. I assume all responsibility for any remaining errors. The first draft of this paper appeared under the same title as an unpublished NEER paper in April 1973. A second draft was circulated under a different title and presented at the World Econometric Society Meetings at Toronto, 1975.\n\n\n"
