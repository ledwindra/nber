    "abstract": "\n\nEconomists tend to assume that redistributive transfers increase equity but cause a loss in efficiency, the so-called 'leaky bucket' effect.  This paper explores situations where efficiency losses are small or where equity and efficiency might even complement each other.  A simple model identifies key parameters that cause leaky buckets and which policy can affect.  Three situations are discussed where the equity/efficiency tradeoff may be low:  When transfers go to populations with no capacity to change their behavior; when transfers go to programs that limit efficiency losses through behavioral requirements; and when commodities are subsidized that function as long-term investments and create future income gains.\n\n",
