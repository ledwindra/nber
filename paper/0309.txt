January 1979
How Elastic Is the Demand for Labor?
SUMMARY

This paper investigates the magnitude of the elasticity of demand
for labor in time series data using more general and complete models of

demand than have been previously employed. It argues that previous analyses
have imposed two invalid constraints in calculations, which bias downward estimated

elasticities. The first invalid constraint is the assumption that real
capital prices have an equal opposite effect to real wages in the demand

equation. We show on measurement error grounds that this constraint should
not be imposed in econometric work even when longrun homogeneity of prices

correctly characterizes the market. The constraint is rejected in the
data. The second invalid constraint is that all explanatory variables
have the same lag distribution. We argue that this constraint is invalid
when decisions are made under uncertainty and find that it is also rejected

by the data. The principal positive empirical finding is that with the

relaxed, the elasticity, of demand with respect to real wages
is much larger than the estimates in the literature, indicating much greater
constraints

price responsiveness on the demand side of the labor market than has
previously been thought.

Time series studies of the determinants of employment have tended to
find relatively low elasticities of response to factor prices. One body

of literature has ignored relative price effects and focused exclusively on

the adjustment of employment to output) Other studies have entered
relative factor prices into adjustment models, to find negligible elastici-

ties. The recent study by Nadiri and Rosen, which represents the most
comprehensive work to date, obtained virtually zero elasticities of
demand in aggregate and two—digit manufacturing data.

Reviewing the

literature, Hamermesh concluded that a concensus value of the fixed output
response of employment to wages in the long run was a bare —.15 (Hamermesh, table 1).
The econometric evidence of low elasticities of demand may be explained

in several ways: it could result from the particular type of model
specified, with alternative models yielding different results; it could
reflect peculiar variation or lack of variation in the factor price
variables, creating poor empirical "experiments"; it could result from
inadequate measurement of variables; it could reflect correlation between
the wage and error terms due to simultaneity; or it could be, in fact,

study develops a new and more general model of the demand for

labor under cost minimization than those used in previous work and uses
the model to analyze the time series evidence on the magnitude of the
elasticity of demand for labor in United States manufacturing. The

principal finding is that, contrary to much of the literature, the fixed
output elasticity of demand for labor in manufacturing is fairly sizeable.
The coimnon finding of negligible factor price effects appears due to the

2

imposition of the constraint, which is strongly rejected by the data,
that

real

capital prices have as large a positive effect on demand as

the negative effect of real wages.

We begin by examining the patterns of change in the principa1

variables that enter demand analysis: wages, prices, employment and
output. The second section examines alternative models of the demand
for labor, with specific focus on the appropriate empirical specification

of relative prices. Section three presents the basic empirical results.
The paper concludes with a brief summary of the findings.

I

Patterns of Wage and Employment Change
The patterns of change in the principal demand variables in manufacturing

are presented in Table 1. The left hand. side of the table records standard
deviations in the log changes of quantity variables and of ratios of quantity
variables, by quarter, from first quarter 1950 to third quarter 1976.
The right hand side of the table presents comparable standard deviations

in the log changes of the relevant prices and earnings from quarter to
quarter. With one exception, the basic data are obtained directly from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics establishment survey and from the U.S. Department
of Commerce,
of

capital,

as described in the table source. The exception is

the price

which we have measured using the concept of user cost

developed in several articles by Jorgenson, and various associates
(Jorgenson, Hall and Jorgensen). Our measure takes into account the
differential tax treatment of equipment and structures and the presence
of both equity and debt finance, and adjusts the cost of capital for

depreciation and expected capital gains. The formulas and sources of
data for the cost of capital are given in the Appendix.
The table reveals two striking aspects about postwar changes in

3

the prices and quantities of labor, goods, -and capital which condition
econometric analysis of demand relations.

First, there is a markedly different pattern of variation between

quantities and pricin the labor market, the product market, and the capital
market. In the labor and product markets, the standard deviations show much
greater variation over time in quantity variables than in price variables. In

the labor market variation in nroductjon wnrlcer eTnnlnvmpl,t

standard deviation for non—production worker employment is smaller

but still sizeable. In the product market, the pattern is similar, with
the

standard deviation in real shipments far exceeding the standard

deviation in prices. The pattern is reversed in the capital market. The
nominal price of capital shows the greatest variation of any price—side
measure and is more than twice as variable as the stock of capital.
Second, although the variation in nominal and deflated (real) earnings

is smaller than the variation in

employment, the standard deviations of the

two earnings variables are still sufficiently sizeable as to provide a

reasonable "experiment"

from which to estimate demand schedules

Indeed, the

basic data suggest that demand for labor may be quite responsive to changes

in real wages. If, as a crude first approximation, one were to take the
ratio of employment to shipments as indicative of movements along a fixed

demand schedule and changes in real wages as the relevant price—side
variable, the figures show greater variation along the quantity than price

axis. Given a high negative correlation between the variables, this implies
an elasticity of demand above unity.2 In fact, relative to trend, the
ratio of employment to shipments is substantially negatively related to the

real wage variable: in 86 of 107 quarters, the variables move in the

direction; their simple correlation is —0.84. While these

patterns are hardly to be viewed as providing evidence of the magnitude
of elasticities, they highlight the fact that the data evince demand—type
patterns of change.

Much of the variation in real wages occurs, it should be stressed,
in the 1969—75 period when real wages dropped sharply; decomposition of
the overall variance of quant-ity changes into the variance from 1950 to

1969 and the variance from 1969 to 1976 shows that 56% of the total
3

variation occurred in the latter period.

Whereas in the "average" postwar

NBER reference cycle, real wages rose by 2.45% from trough to peak and by
1.34% from peak to trough, a very different pattern is found in the 1970—75

cycle: from 1970:4 to 1973:4 real wages rose only 0.5%; from 1973:4 to
1975:1 they fell by 7.9%. This highlights the extent to which the decline
in real wages in the 1970s provides a distinct "experiment."4

Third, the standard deviations in the log quarterly changes of the
ratio of employment to capital and of the ratio of average hourly earnings
to the price of capital reveal a very different pattern of variation in

the relative quantity of inputs than in the relative price of inputs. Not
unexpectedly, the relative variation in the labor/capital ratio tends to

be dominated by movements in the numerator. More important in terms of
ensuing analysis, howe-er, is the fact that variation in the price of labor
relative to the price of capital is dominated by changes in the cost of capital:
the variance in wages/cost of capital exceeds the variance in nominal wages

approximately the same as the variance in the cost of capital. This

are essentially relating demand for labor to the price of capital rather

6

II Alternative Models of Demand
The standard, static theory of cost minimization subject to a production
constraint can be used to derive an expression for long run labor demand

as a function of planned output and relative prices. For simplicity
assume that the production process in the representative firm can be
approximated by a Cobb—Douglas function of the form:

Qt=a+K+YL

(1)

where K and L represent the log of capital and labor input respectively,

Q is the log of output and a is a constant. When the firm takes all prices
as given, and varies all inputs, cost minimization leads to the following
labor demand function:

+

L

Q

—

-(W_C)

(2)

where 0 = y + and measures returns to scale, W and C are the log of the
prices of labor and capital, Q is the log of. planned output, and b is a constant.

Equation (2) depicts the long run demand for labor. If the firm
faces costs of adjustment, discrepancies between curent labor input and
long run demand may arise as the firm adjusts with a lag to changes in

output or relative prices. A common formulation of the adjustment
process makes use of some variant of the flexible accelerator.

A simple version is given by

= lp(L* —

Li)

(3)

Substituting for L yields an equation for observed labor input:
Lt =

+ Q - (W_C) +

(l4)L1

(4)

Equation (4) places two constraints on the demand equation. First, it
imposes the constraint that the price of labor and the price of capital

have equal, oDposite signed, coefficients. This restriction derives from the
homogeneity of the production process and is assumed to hold in each perio4.

7

The second constraint embodied in (4) is that the explanatory variables
W,- C, and Q have the same lag structure. The equation imposes this
constraint by specifying that changes in these variables affect labor demand
through changes in the latent variable L. This restriction assumes that
the cost of moving to the new target is the only source of legged adjustment
in

the

system and that

expectations

are static or are formed identically

for all variables.5

We argue that neither of these constraints should necessarily be

imposed on the data. The homogeneity constraint, though theoretically valid
in models of the demand- for labor by a firm, should not be imposed on the

data when capital prices are subject to sizeable measurement error. The
constraint that all explanatory variables have the same lagged effect on
employment is not appropriate when decisions are made under uncertainty.

Measurement error and the relative price constraint

Assume that in the long run

and C have equal opposite signs but

that the price of capital is measured with considerable error. In this case,
one can get a better estimate of the long run elasticity of demand for
labor by letting wages and capital enter the equations separately than
by imposing the constraint the they enter with equal opposite signed coefficients.
To see the implications of measurement error in C assume that the
true model is (conditional on other variables)

Lt = a0 —

cL(W_c) + e

where W and C represent logs of

(5)

wages and cost of capital measured in real

terms. The price of capital is measured with error, so that

(7)

We assume that measurement error in capital and the error in the equation
are independent of the other variables and are independent of each other:
that is E(Wv) = E(We) = E(Ce) =

Equation (16) differs from equation (4) in the specification of relative

factor prices. In (16) demand depends on the ratio of the expected value of
w to the expected value of c, not on the ratio of factor prices or the

expectation of the ratio. When c and w do not follow the same stochastic
process, this implies that their lag structures should differ. To illustrate,
consider the situation in which the "true" cost of capital in the current

noise input, independent of u. The process of determining an expected
cost of capital can be treated as a problem of choosing an optimal

predictor of .

For simplicity we restrict the predictor to be a linear

combination of past observations of c. Assuming that the firm's objective
is to miniinize the mean square error of the forecast, the optimal predictor

of c can be expressed as
c

The distributed lag given by (17:. is based on a highly simplified

stochastic process; a more realistic characterization would yield a much

ire complicated lag structure. The important point here, however, is that
the nature of the distributed lag depends on the characteristIcs of the

process generating observed values of w and c. Since wages and capital
costs are likely to follow different stochastic processes, the lag

structure associated with each will be different. As long as past
observations of w and c are used in forming expectations and the stochastic

Hence, the

determining likely means of

the ratio of expected wages to expected costs of capital. Even though
variations in wage rates and capital costs may influence labor demand through
their effect on the relative price term, the firm must examine the past
history of each variable separately in forming expectations.

The empirical implication of uncertainty in factor prices is that
W and C should be allowed to have different lag distributions in labor
demand analysis and thus that past values of these variables should enter

the equation separately. This is true even if we impose the long run
homogeneity constraint. While the ultimate long run effect of W and C
may be identical, the speed of adjustment and other aspects of the time
pattern of response may be quite different.

Taken together, the presence of uncertainty and errors of measurement

separately.

Ignoring adjustment costs for the moment, the basic

two—factor model can be written as

e

(18)

12

If, as noted earlier, we assume that

planned

output is based on a forecast

of shipments, then Q can be replacecf by expected real shipments E(St).
Depending on the specification of expectation formation, Lt will depend on

current and lagged values of the variables, and lags in the system will
be solely attributed to problems of information and uncertainty. Adjustment
costs can be introduced through an equation like (3), so that (18) becomes

=

aO

+ . lnE(s) —

-lnE(w)

+ lnE(c)].+ (l_p)Li

(19)

Clearly, (19) may be rewritten to eliminate Ltl so that L depends
only on current and past values of the independent variables. Lags due
to adjustment costs would be confounded with lags due to expectations, and

without

further restrictions the separate influence of each could not be

identified. However, sorting out the separate influence of expectations
and adjustment costs and determining the specific time pattern of response

is of secondary importance in the current analysis. In terms of evaluating
the elasticity of demand, the precise pattern of adjustment and the source
of lags in the system are of interest only insofar as they affect estimates
of the elasticity parameter or raise questions about the appropriate model

of demand. With respect to estimated elasticities, empirical evidence to
be presented in Section III shows that different adjustment processes affect
the timing but not the magnitude of the estimated demand response.

Accordingly we shall focus on the question of whether all independent

variables have the same lag distribution. If a common distributed lag
caniot be rejected, it could be argued that adjustment costs are the
principal source of lags and that the lagged effects of the independent
variables work through the latent variable L* as posited in the standard

flexible accelerator model. Significant differences in the lag structure
will reject the standard adjustment model and provide support for the
7

specification based on uncertainty and expectations presented earlier.

III Empirical Results

This section presents estimates of the models of labor demand developed
in section II using data for U.S. manufacturing from first quarter 1950

to third quarter 1976. We focus first on the size of elasticity estimates
obtained with models of the firm that have different specifications of

relative prices and processes of adjustment. Subsequent analysis examines
the effect of changes in several assumptions on the estimated elasticities.

The principal finding is that, as long as wages and the price of capital
are allowed to have different impacts on demand for labor, the estimated
elasticities are quite sizeable, from 2 1/2 to 3 times the values obtained

when the variables are constrained to have the same impact.

Estimates of the 2—factor model
The basic empirical framework used in this section is provided by
a fairly general form:

where c

the error term and all variables are in logs. The data used

cover the manufacturing sector as described in table 1. L is the log of
production worker employment, S is the log of shipments, W is the log
average hourly earnings, and C is log of the cost of capital, all expressed
in real terms by deflating by the WPI for manufacturing.
The distributed lags in (20) will be examined along three lines.
To develop a benchmark we will impose the constraint that the lag
distributions follow a geometric pattern, with b =

d1=

in.

for

all 1, so

14

(20) may be estimated with a Koyck lag. This constraint will then be
relaxed, and the lag weights estimated using Almon polynomials. Finally,
unconstrained lagged values of the independent variables will be

entered into the equations. The length of the lag appropriate for each
variable will be chosen empirically, based on minimizing the error sum
of squares.

Our principal focus in the analysis which follows is the magnitude of
and
and
Ebj =

Given the methods of estimation outlined above, estimates of
(and 0) can be obtained only under the assumption that
=

Em

=

1, since no attempt will be made to estimate the long

run parameters and the lag weights separately. The assumption holds exactly
for the Koyck lag, and seems reasonable in the other situations as well.
It should be noted that the most likely alternative is that the sum of the

weights is less than one. Thus if the unity constraint on the sum of
the weights is not true, it is likely that the estimated long run elasticities
will be downward biased.

Table 2 presents estimates of equation (20) under several specifications

of the lag structure and relative prices. In columns 1 and 2 a Koyck
lag has been imposed; column 3 presents results with an unconstrained
lag, while column 4 contains results when the coefficients

ollow a second degree polynomial. The relative prices are entered separately
in each column except the first, where the long run homogeneity constraint

is imposed. The estimated elasticity of demand for labor in co1inn 1,
which imposes the same lag distribution on the two variables, is

consistent with other results in the literature: the long run elasticity
of —.19 is of the same magnitude as Hamermesh's summary value —.15

(Hamermesh, 1976). We argued earlier that imposition of the constraint

15

of

÷

— 0 may not be appropriate in the presence of measurnent

error and uncertainty. Entering the prices separately finds empirical
support in column 2, where C and W obtain

very different coefficients. The

evidence suggests a wage elasticity of —.253 in the short run, and a

value of —.463 over the longer term. The cost of capital, in contrast,
is estimated to have a short run impact of .062 and a long run

effect of .114. Thus, both wage rates and the cost of capital are found
to influence the demand for labor, with wages estimated to have an impact

about four times as large. These results imply that models which specify
identical, opposite signed effects of factor prices are not consistent
with the data.8 It appears that one reason for the small elasticities

found in previous work is imposition of a model ( +

= 0) which is

rejected by the data.

The results in columns 1 and 2 are based on a model of the adjustment
process in which changes in wages and the cost of capital influence
labor demand through their effect on desired employment.

Costs of adjustment

yield a lagged response which has the same time pattern in all variables.

The assumption of a conon geometric lag structure is dropped in columns 3—4
and more general lag distributions estimated.

Changing the lag structure

has little impact on the magnitude of long run elasticities of demand

for labor. The long run wage parameter lies between —.472 and —.489,
while the long run output elasticity ranges from 1.058 to 1.069. Only

in the case of the cost of capital did the lag secficaton have nv
impact on the magnitude of the elasticity. In experiments

not reported here,

shortening the lag from 8 to 3 quarters reduces the effect by almost 30 percent.
The magnitude of the capital cost elasticity was sensitive to the

length of the lag up until about 8 quarters out. Beyond that point the
value of the coefficient remained relatively close to 0.100.
The actual lag structures in the variables, given In figure 1,

suggests that the lagged response to changes in the cost of capital Is

somewhat slower than the response to shifts in sales, and quite a bit
slower than the response to changes in the wage. The strikingly different

pattern of response shown in figure 1 is consistent with an uncertainty!
expectations rationale for lagged adjustment, in which the speed and pattern
of adjustment depends on the stochastic structure generating observed

values of the independent variables. The longest response time is in
the variable with the highest noise—to—signal ratio, the cost of capital.

In contrast, firms appear to respond relatively rapidly to changes in wage

rates which are more easily predicted. The differences in lag response
provide further npirica1 justification for treating wages and the cost of
capital sepatately, and for relaxing the assumption of a cotmnon lag distribution.

Given the preceding adjustments to the basic 2—factor model, the
evidence suggests that the wage elasticity of demand for production workers
in manufacturing lies between —.15 and —.20 in the short run (one quarter),

with the full effect of approximately —.48 completed after 2—3 quarters.

Analysis of assumptions
The elasticity estimates in table 2 are based on a 2—factor model of
the production process, in which the firm treats prices as parameters and
input decisions are made conditional on an output plan derived from a sales

forecast. The 2—factor framework ignores the influence of variation in
other factors of production by implicitly assuming that they move in proportion
to changes in the number of production workers or that they are fixed. The model
further assumes that sales can be treated as an exogenous term, thereh
ignoring questions of simultaneity in the determination of output
employment1 and factor prices. Finally, the adjustment process underlying
the basic results does not allow for feedback between the factors of
production of the type stressed by Nadiri and Rosen, among others.

several of these postulates. For comparison, line 1 reproduces the coefficients

from the basic model (column 2, table 2). The potential impact of simultaneity
is examined in lines

2—4. In

line 2 we treat shipments as endogenous,

instrumenting it on the exogenous measures of aggregate demand specified

in the table note. In line 3, we instrument factor prices as well as
shipments on the aggregate demand measures. Use of the demand side instruments
in lines 2 and 3 has

very

little effect on the estimated coefficients.

As expected, the long run elasticity increases somewhat, but the change

is marginal. In line 4 we shift from demand to supply factors, instrumenting
the real wage on measures of shifts in supply. With the supply instruments,
the short run elasticity increases by 20 percent, while the estimated

long run impact is —.53. This suggests the possibility that the "demand
relation" between employment and wages in the data is contaminated by
simultaneity on the supply side leading to underestimates of the elasticity
of demand.

Expansion of the 2—factor model to include additional inputs (non—
production workers, inventories) requires more complete data on factor prices.
As Nadiri and Rosen have shown, appropriate measures would include wage
rates, fringe benefits, search and training costs,-and inventory carrying

costs. The availability of such data would permit a distinction between
stock and flow demands, and would allow

estimation of the elasticity of

demand for production workers holding constant the prices of additional
relevant inputs. The full range of factor price data is not available on
a time series basis,and the usual procedure is to assume that all

of

the user cost of labor and

with

the

price of inventories

facets

vary proportionally

average hourly earnings, or the cost of capital. Without additional

data, the implications of this assumption cannot be examined.

However,

some feel for the influence of additional inputs may be obtained by

using

available data on hours per worker, the number of non—production workers and
the stock of capital to modify our estimating equations further.

the adjustment process are to be viewed

as

no more than illustrative of

the impact of specification changes on estimates. In the long run, one
clearly does not want to hold these other inputs fixed.9
An alternative more desirable way of treating additional inputs is

to analyze interrelations in terms of the effect of discrepancies between

actual and desired levels of other inputs. One way of doing this is
generalize the flexible accelerator as in:

Xit=ZjX"
i it—xit—l )

to

(21)

where X's are inputs (see Nadiri and Rosen). Assuming X' is determined by

expected sales and relative prices, solution of (21) for X yields an equaticn
similar to the basic Koyck lag model, with the addition of lagged values of all

other inputs. In the current setting, interrelated adjustment is examined

22

by relating production worker employment to the usual variables, but
including lagged values of hours—per—worker, inventories, non—production

employment, and the capital stock (all variables In logs). The results
are presented in line 9 and footnote 8 of table 3. Allowing for interrelated
adjustment has only a marginal effect on the short run ilasticity, which

falls to —.24. To calculate a long run elasticity it is necessary to
estimate comparable equations for all inputs and solve the resultant

difference equation system. For production workers, this procedure yields
a long run elasticity of —.49. Together with the evidence in table 2, these
results underscore the point that alternative lag structures have little
impact on the estimated elasticity.

IV Conclusion
The examination of demand for labor in this paper has yielded
substantive empirical results regarding the magnitude of the elasticIty of
demand and more technical findings regarding alternative model struc'ttres.

The principal finding is that

under

a variety of specifications, che

elasticity of demand for production labor is quite sizeable, far from the

very small estimates traditionally found in the literature. The low
elasticities found in previous work appear to be due to the imposition
of the long run homogeneity constraint in the presence of measurement

error. We have found that while our basic results are invariant to
changes in the lag structure, the data reject both the imposition of identical
lag structures on the explanatory variables, and the restriction of equal
opposite signed factor price coefficients. The rejection of a cotmnon
lag structure on all explanatory variables suggests the need for new

models of the adjustment process in the labor market, with emphasis on
the role of uncertainty and expectations.

The evidence that demand for labor is more responsive to changes in real
wages than had been previously thought suggests that greater attention be
given to policIes, like employment tax credits, which seek to stimulate
-__employment by inducing movements along demand schedules.

7The analysis in the text follows existing literature by analyzing demand
for labor by an individual cost—minimizing firms and thus on the fixed output

demand elasticity. Because the data relate to industry level aggregates,
however, questions arise about whether models of the firm offer the

appropriate tool of analysis. The principal difference between the fixed—
output demand schedule of a firm and the industry—level demand schedule

relates to the exogeneity of the scale of output. Whereas the cost—minimizing
firm takes output as exogenous and the profit—making firm takes the price
of output as exogenous, the level of output and price are endogenous

variables to the industry. As is well known, with price and output endogenous,
the elasticity of demand depends not only on substitution but also on

"scale effects." An increase in the wage reduces demand for labor by
causing substitution against labor and also by reducing industry output
through increased costs and prices. An increase in the price of capital,
by contrast, raises demand for labor by causing substitution toward labor

but also reduces demand for labor by reducing industry output through
increased costs and prices. The differential scale and sul.stitution effects
induced by capital price changes compared to those induced by wage changes

provides another reason for relaxing the assumption that W an C enter the
demand equation with equal opposite signs.
Estimates of industry demand curves with output endogenous require,
however, detailed investigation of the factors that shift the demand for output,

which goes beyond the scope of the current analysis (see Houthakker and
Taylor for empirical estimates of demand for industry ouput). Hence, no effort is

made in
focus

this

study to estimate the indusry level demand curves. Since we

solely on fixed—output demand relations, the "full" elasticity

of demand for labor exceeds the estimates on

our

models.

25

8The important finding that the relative factor price model if rejected
by
the data can be examined in another way. Associated with the optimal level

of employment is a factor price frontier relating price of output to the

price of inputs. With a Cobb—Douglas constant returns production function
the factor price frontiers can be written as

time, used to index of technical change. If the quarterly data lie on

the long run frontier regressions of P on W, C and T should yield positive
coefficients on the two input prices with coefficients that sum, at least

approximately, to unity. After considerable effort to obtain estimates
consistent with the model, the following "best" results were obtained:

Both sums of the coefficients diverge

significantly from unity, providing

further evidence against the standard relative factor price model. The
model simply does not fit the data.
9The proper way to deal with several inputs is to imbed

the

labor demand

function into a consistent system of factor demand relations. As a further
check on our empirical findings we estimated elasticities of demand from
a three input translog cost function, using annual data on production

workers, nonproduction workers, and capital. While most attention has been
given to the translog production function in analysis, we believe that the
translog cost function offers a more fruitful means of

estimating the elasticity

of demand. The factor demand equations obtained from the cost function
relates shares to factor prices, consistent with the single equation models,

26

while the production function relates shares to factor quantities. In
analyzing a single sector such as manufacturing the first specification seems
more plausible.

Given factor prices and input levels, we calculated cost as the sum of

factor outlays and then derived the cost shares by division. We treated
technological change as an additional input, estimated as the rate of growth
of total cost deflated by the price of output less a weighted average of
input growth weights, with input shares in cost as weights.

The parameters of the constrained translog cost system were jointly estimated
using an iterative version of Zeliner's minimum distance estimator. To correct.
for the possible endogenous determination of factor prices we combined the
iterative Zeilner procedure with two stage least squares using the same

instruments as in the single equation analysis (see table 3, note 2). This
iterative version of three stage least squares is asymptotically equivalent
to full information maximum likelihood (see Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman).

With the full translog constraint only two of the share equations are

needed. Assuming neutral technical change the blue collar and white collar
