Randomization with Asymetric Information

ABSTRACT

It is by now well-known that,

in the presence of moral hazard or

adverse selection, randomization of insurance premia and benefits may be
Pareto efficient.

i) provides a typology of the various forms
ii) derives necessary and/or sufficient condi-

tions for the desirability of these various forms of randomization; iii) obtains some simple characterization theorems of the efficient random policies;
iv) gives some intuition behind the results;

and v) considers why randomiza-

tion appears to occur less often in practice than the theory suggests it

Throughout the paper, competitive equilibrium (when it

exists) corresponds to the solution of the monopoly problem with expected

utility at the competitive equilibrium level(s).3 Thus, when we say that
randomization is desirable, we mean that randomization

is Pareto efficient,

profitable for a monopoly insurer, and is a characteristic of competitive
equilibrium.

1.

Moral Hazard
Consider the simplest moral hazard setting.

There are a large number

of identical individuals, each of whom realizes one of two possible outcomes
or

events. Either an accident does not occur in which case the individual

receives

w

prior to insurance, or an accident4 does occur in which case the
receives w-d, where d

Is the accident damage. The probability that

an accident occurs depends on

the individual's accident-prevention effort, e;
i.e. p=p(e). It is assumed that p'cO and p''>O, and that the individual always expends some effort in the monopoly solution. Also, individuals accident

probabilities are statistically independent.
Moral hazard arises because an insurer is unable to observe effort.

As a result, insurance contracts cannot be written contingent on effort,

that the insurer can, however, ohserve its clients' total insurance
purchases..5 In these circumstances, the non-random insurance contract will
specify a (net) insurance payout or benefit a payable to an individual if an
accident occurs and an insurance premium fi payable by the individual if an

accident does not occur. Thus, consumption (y) is w-d÷a when an accident does

occur, and

when it does not.

The individual's expected utility is

The individual chooses effort to maximize expected utility, taking
the parameters of the insurance contract as given.

This yields a function or

The insurers prob-

lem is to choose (a,fl) to maximize profits subject to providing

with a given level of expected utility.6
The question to be addressed

is;

Under what circumstances

does ran-

domization of the parameters of the insurance contract result in a welfare
improvement?
The basic intuition behind why randomization might be desirable is

4

this:

Moral hazard causes a tradeoff between risk-bearing and incentives,

since if full insurance were provided the insured would take little or no
As a result, the deterministic monopoly insur-

level of effort.

A compensated randomization of insurance may cause the in-

sured to increase effort by enough that profits are increased

The techniques

of Rothschild-Stiglitz [1970] can be used to ascertain conditions under which
a mean-preserving randomization of, say, the payout will increase effort at
accident avoidance; randomization will do so provided only that the firstorder condition for effort is convex in the payout.

Randomization also has a

direct, negative effect on risk-averse individuals.

Thus, whether randomiza-

tion is desirable depends on a careful balancing of the welfare gains from the

mitigation of the moral

While the latter depend on the degree of risk aversion (which depends

on first and second derivatives of the utility function), the former depend on

that randomization may in some circumstances be desirable. Characterization

It is evident from the diagram that,

randomization stems from the convexity of

and ii) that no more

than two random policies are needed in a profit-maximizing contract with

We formalize this intuition in a series of Propositions.
Proposition 5:

If

EU(ll)

is concave, ex ante randomization is never desirable.

Proposition 6:

If

EU(ll)

is convex at the level of profits at the determirtis-

tic monopoly insurer profit maximum, then cx ante randomization is desirable.14
Proposition 7:

With cx ante randomization,

no more than two random policies

are required in the profit-maximizing insurance contract.
In the absence of any

because of diminishing marginal utility. But with moral

changes, effort changes.

In the normal case, as profit increases

(decreases), the individual will expend more (less) effort at accident avoidance.

If the absolute value of the individual's effort response is greater

for increases in profits than to decreases (in

a

sense to be made more precise

The desirability of non-local randomization is difficult to characterize
because it depends on global rather than local properties of the event-contingent utility functions and the probability of accident function. In what
follows, we shall therefore consider only local randomizations.

changes in levels (which are critical for ascertaining the convexity or concavity of profit as a function of

To simplify, we have considered ex post and ex ante randomization in
isolation.

It should be evident that there are circumstances in which it is

desirable to employ both forms of randomization simultaneously.

2.

Selection
It seems plausible that randomization can be desirable when adverse

selection is present, by altering the position of the self-selection locus.
To investigate this, we treat the case where there are two groups in the population,

one high-risk (H) and one low-risk (L).
Suppose that, in the absence of randomization, the monopoly insurer

provides group H with contract (&H,bH) and group L contract

Throughout this

we assume that profit-maximization entails the insurer offering a

We now consider the use of randomization as a self-selection device.
Again, randomization can take on two forms.

We randomize the contract for low-risk individuals in such a way

i) there are two policies,

ii) low-risk

utility is the same with either policy and equals their certainty

Randomization will then be desirable if (and only if) it lowers the utility of
the high-risk individuals when they hold the low-risk contract, since if this
happens, the self-selection constraint is relaxed, and the low-risk contract
can then be adjusted to increase its profitability. To simplify the algebra,
it is assumed that both groups' utility functions are event-independent.

The intuition for this result is straightforward.

When a high-risk

individual is infinitely risk-averse, he will care only about the worst possible outcome. Since the randomization worsens the worst possible outcome
when the low-risk contract is bought, it reduces the utility of the high-risk
individual when he purchases the low-risk contract,

which relaxes the self-

selection constraint.

Consider the extreme case where A' is close to zero.

Then the ran-

domization undertaken is almost a randomization along the low-risk budget
line,

Because the high-risk group is risk-averse, its expected utility

in-

creases less from the increase in insurance in one policy than its expected
utility decreases from the almost same-sized decrease in insurance in the
other OiiCy.

Hence, the randomization loosens the self-selection constraint.

Note that none of the above results depend on constancy of absolute
risk aversion and that finite randomizations may be Pareto-improving even when
infinitesmal randomizations are not.
We have examined the circumstances

under which randomization is de-

sirable with either moral hazard or adverse selection, and explained the results,

Future research should extend these results to the general situation

where both moral hazard and adverse selection are present.

Discussion
In the previous two sections we employed standard assumptions to de-

rive necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the randomization of insurance

23

contracts to be desirable. We investigated the desirability of randomization by analyzing whether randomization could increase the profits of a monopoly insurer faced with expected utility constraints.
if each insurer can observe his clients

It bears repeating that

titive equilibrium18 coincides with the solution to the monopoly insurers
problem when the expected utility levels are those that would obtain in competitive equilibrium. Hence, all the results of the paper apply to competi
tive equilibrium.

sa

In the absence of relevant empirical work, it is not possible to

how stringent the conditions we derived for randomization to be desirable in

fact are.

However, none of our arguments implies that randomization is

mally' undesirable. Thus,

1ncr-

it is remarkable that randomization of insurance

contracts is not in fact observed.

This statement needs to be qualified

somewhat since the seeming capriciousness of the tax collector and insurance
adjustor could be veiled forms of randomization9 Nevertheless,

we know of

How can

e

explain this apparent discrepancy between theory and fact?

Along with the possibility that the conditions for randomization ar
never met, we have come up with six reasons why randomization might not occur
as frequently as the theory suggests.

Each of these reasons leads one to

question the appropriateness of some of the assumptions underlying our analysis and more generally underlying much of the literature on incentives

and

contracts, particularly that focussing on non-linear contracts.
1.

Firms may not have discovered the advantages of randomization or else cus-

tomers may be reluctant to purchase random insurance policies since they do
not understand them.

To the extent that this explanation is valid, one must

question the appropriateness of assuming that the contracting parties exhibit

24

unbounded rationality
2.

A related argument is that it is costly to write down and enforce complex

contracts.

This argument is consistent with the observation that non- stochas-

tic contracts are almost invariably considerably less complex than contract
theory predicts.

If this argument carries force, then contract theory should

treat the costs of complexity.

Simple contracts may be observed not only because the costs of complexity are high, but also because the benefits are low.20'21
3.

Even in those circumstances where randomization of insurance contracts is

desirable, insured individuals would obtain insurance against the randomization if they could.
insurance,

They would perceive the benefits of such randomization

but because they act non-cooperatively would neglect that,

in re-

sponse to everyonets purchasing the randomization insurance, accident insurance companies would be forced to offer less attractive contracts in order to
break even.

Full randomization insurance would completely neutralize the ef-

fects of randomization of the accident insurance contract, and so accident
insurance firms would have no incentive to randomize. The analysis assumed
away such randomization insurance.22 But with limited observability, which
underlies both moral hazard and adverse selection,

the assumption may be

unwarranted.23 A more satisfactory analysis would describe the economy in
such a way that which markets are present and what contracts are enforceable,
are derived rather than assumed.
4.

In some contexts (e.g., the draft in the U.S.) lotteries are commonly re-

garded as fair, in other contexts as unfair (horizontal equity).

While the

persuasive modelling of fairness and horizontal equity has proved elusive, it
may be that consumers would find random iriurance policies unattractive because they view them as unfair.

25

5.

For other, familiar reasons, one may question the appropriateness of em-

ploying von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility theory (?Iachina [1987]).

6.

A sixth reason why such contracts may not be employed is that individuals

may not trust their insurers to randomize in the manner specified in their
contracts. To know whether a firm is complying with the contract, an individual must know not only which policy he has been assigned, but also which pOlicies have been assigned to all its other clients.

Even if he were able to

verify that the firm assigned the policies with the contractually-specified
probabilities, the firm could still cheat by assigning the policies in a

tematic

way, e.g. to friends or to those offering kickbacks.

sys-

Whether reputa-

tion would be an effective enforcement mechanism in this context is moot.
A final point is that precluding randomization by assumption is not a
satisfactory way of treating the empirical fact that random contracts are not
observed.

First, by prohibiting randomization from entering through the front

result
ond, one cannot be sure that whatever considerations (discussed above)
in random insurance contracts not being observed do not also have implications
for the structure of nonrandom contracts. For example, if complexity is

im-

and nonportant, the competitive equilibrium contract may be simple, linear,

26

random.

But if one were simply to exclude random contracts by assumption,

without explicitly treating complexity, the solution might indicate that the

equilibrium contract would be highly non-linear and complex. For both these
reasons, disallowing random contracts by assumption is likely to generate
spurious results.
