    "abstract": "\n\nThe average distance of U.S. banks from their small corporate borrowers increased before the global \ufb01nancial crisis, especially for banks in competitive counties. Small distant loans are harder to make, so loan quality deteriorated. Surprisingly, such lending intensi\ufb01ed as the Fed raised interest rates from 2004. Why? We show banks\u2019 responses to higher rates led to bank deposits shifting into competitive counties. Short-horizon bank management recycled these in\ufb02ows into risky loans to distant uncompetitive counties. Thus, rate hikes, competition, and managerial short-termism explain why in\ufb02ows \u2018burned a hole\u2019 in banks\u2019 pockets and, more generally, increased risky lending.\n\n",
