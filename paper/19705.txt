ABSTRACT
Parameter learning strongly amplifies the impact of macro shocks on marginal utility when the representative
agent has a preference for early resolution of uncertainty. This occurs as rational belief updating generates
subjective long-run consumption risks. We consider general equilibrium models with unknown parameters
governing either long-run economic growth, the variance of shocks, rare events, or model selection.
Overall, parameter learning generates long-lasting, quantitatively significant additional macro risks
that help explain standard asset pricing puzzles.

Introduction

Asset pricing theories commonly assume a particularly strong form of knowledge by economic agents: they know the true model and true parameter values. This is, in part,
motivated by conventional wisdom suggesting that parameter learning has negligible asset pricing implications. To see why, assume normally distributed consumption growth,
i:i:d:
ln(Ct ) = yt
N ( ; 2 ), is unknown, and that
N ( 0 ; A0 2 ) a priori. Bayesian
updating implies the posterior is N ( t ; At 2 ) ; where t and At are recursively de…ned and
y t is data up to time t: Under power utility preferences, the ‘equity’premium on a single2
period consumption claim is
(1 + At ). Since At decreases rapidly over time, parameter
uncertainty has a small initial and quickly dissipating impact on asset prices.
We show that this conventional wisdom does not hold generally because rational parameter learning generates subjective long run consumption risks that have important asset
pricing implications when the representative agent has Epstein-Zin recursive utility (see
Bansal and Yaron (2004)). Long run risks arise because posterior distributions, P ( 2 Ajy t ),
as well as posterior moments, are martingales (e.g., Doob (1949)), which implies that shocks
to rational beliefs are permanent and impact consumption growth in all future periods. For
agents who prefer early resolution of uncertainty, assets whose payo¤s are a¤ected by unknown parameters may therefore be particularly risky. The same logic holds when there is
uncertainty over the model speci…cation and agents learn about the ‘true’model over time.
Parameter uncertainty is intuitively important, especially in asset pricing models with
numerous parameters and increasingly complex dynamics. In many common speci…cations,
the main asset pricing implications arise from long-run properties of consumption dynamics
and/or rare events, both of which are extremely hard-to-estimate with observed histories of
macroeconomic aggregates. This fact suggests the importance of accounting for parameter
uncertainty when analyzing the relation between macroeconomic risks and asset prices, as
emphasized in Hansen (2007).
This paper studies qualitatively and quantitatively how parameter uncertainty impacts
asset prices when the temporal resolution of uncertainty matters. The overall …nding is
that reasonable calibrations of parameter and model uncertainty can tremendously amplify
the perceived quantity of aggregate risk, with corresponding strong implications for asset
prices. Parameter learning a¤ects asset prices principally because belief updating leads to
large shocks to continuation utility. This is distinct from other conduits (e.g., Weitzmann
(2007)), where parameter uncertainty leads to fat-tailed predictive distributions, increasing
1

the probability of very high marginal utility states. Since the shocks to beliefs are permanent,
even a small amount of parameter uncertainty can have a large e¤ect on continuation utility,
which is a function of the conditional distribution of consumption in all future periods. As
continuation utility shocks arise from subjective beliefs updates, learning can drive a large
wedge between the known-parameters consumption dynamics and the dynamic behavior of
the pricing kernel. For instance, large time series variation in the price of risk and the equity
risk premium can arise from homoskedastic macro fundamentals, even though the preferences
are time- and state-invariant.1
Since there are many di¤erent types of parameters (means, variances, transition probabilities, etc.), we are particularly interested in understanding when parameter learning may
generate large and long-lasting e¤ects on central asset pricing quantities like the risk premium and return volatility of the aggregate consumption and dividend claims, as well as real
yields on short- and long-term default-free bonds. To this end, we consider a range of models with uncertainty about parameters governing di¤erent aspects of aggregate consumption
dynamics.
We …rst consider the simple consumption growth model described above and document,
analytically and numerically, the asset pricing implications of an unknown mean growth
rate. While overly simple to be realistic, this model highlights the underlying economics.
In addition to this case, we consider learning about the variance of shocks (see Weitzmann
(2007) and Bakshi and Skoulakis (2010)), as well as parameters governing the persistence and
severity of rare events (see, Rietz (1988), Barro (2006, 2009), and Gourio (2012) for models
on disaster risk). Finally, we consider parameter uncertainty in the form of model uncertainty
where the agent is learning whether consumption growth is iid or contains a small, persistent
component. This range of model and types of parameter uncertainty provide a taxonomy of
how Bayesian parameter learning impacts asset prices.
In terms of realistic calibrations, learning about the persistence of rare events or otherwise
hard to measure bad states of the economy has dramatic and quite realistic asset pricing
e¤ects. For example, consider a Markov-switching model where the bad state occurs once
every 100 years on average, with a mean and persistence calibrated to U.S. consumption
data during the Great Depression. With uncertainty over the persistence of the bad state,
assuming a 100 year training sample, the model delivers an equity risk premium over the last
1

Related, long-run consumption risk due to parameter learning does not imply predictability of consumption growth moments— a controversial feature of standard long-run risk models (see Beeler and Campbell
(2012)).

2

100 years of about 6% when the agent has relative risk aversion (RRA) coe¢ cient of 3.9 and
an elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) of 2. The pricing kernel volatility is high, a
prerequisite for explaining asset price moments (see Hansen and Jagannathan (1991)). With
a 200 year training sample, the equity risk premium falls to 5%. The corresponding ‘fullinformation’model with known parameters generates a risk premium of 1%. Thus, realistic
parameter uncertainty provides a dramatic magni…cation of macroeconomic risks on asset
prices. Further, the model can match the very high equity return volatility at the onset of the
Great Depression relative to normal times, as well as the drop in aggregate price-dividend
ratios, as the risk premium increases strongly in bad times.
Learning about rare event parameters, though realistic and important, has only a minor
impact on dynamics during ‘normal’ times, since learning about bad states is rare. We
therefore also consider learning about parameters governing business cycle ‡uctuations in
consumption via a case of model uncertainty. Here, the representative agent is uncertain
whether consumption growth is i.i.d. or it contains a small, persistent component a la Bansal
and Yaron (2004).2 In this case, the impact of learning on asset prices is quantitatively large
and endogenously long lasting. In fact, learning generates a high price of risk even if agents
assign a very small probability to the more risky economy with persistent shocks. The
price of risk and the risk premium vary substantially even though both are constant in each
individual model and can, in certain states, be more than double their size in either of the
individual models. When feeding this model the actual consumption realizations over the
post-WW2 U.S. sample, the price of risk and the equity market risk premium are high in
recessions relative to expansions, as in the data.
Alvarez and Jermann (2004) argue that asset prices imply small welfare costs from business cycle ‡uctuations if business cycles are comprised of only transitory ‡uctuations, consistent with the analysis is Lucas (1987). In the model uncertainty case we analyze, a non-trivial
fraction of the variation in beliefs stems from business-cycle ‡uctuations during the postWW2 U.S. sample. Thus, business cycle ‡uctuations are associated with permanent shocks
to subjective consumption dynamics, and carry therefore ‘long-run’risk. Alvarez and Jermann (2004, 2005) document empirically that permanent components in the pricing kernel
are the main source of large welfare costs. Our learning channel provides an endogenous
mechanism for how such large permanent macro shocks arise.
2

A similar problem is analyzed in Hansen and Sargent (2010), but they focus on learning under a preference
for robustness.

Parameter learning as a source of long-run risks

Parameter uncertainty and rational updating generates truly ‘long-run’ risks. Intuitively,
this occurs because the forecast errors of optimal beliefs are unpredictable, which implies
that shocks to beliefs are permanent. Mathematically, long run risks arise due to various
martingale properties associated with conditional probabilities.
Denote the time-t posterior density of a vector of parameters as p ( jy t ). By the law of
iterated expectations, P [ 2 Ajy t ] ; expectations of functions of the parameters (E [h ( ) jy t ]),
and likelihood ratio statistics are all martingales. This is easy to see: de…ning t E [ jy t ] ;
E

t+1 jy

t

=E E

jy t+1 jy t = E

jy t =

(1)

t:

Thus, the belief process, t , is a martingale, and evolves via t+1 = t + t+1 ; where
E t+1 jy t = 0: From this, it is clear that the shocks to rational beliefs, t+1 , are not just
persistent, but permanent as they have a unit root. This property of Bayesian parameter
learning has been noted before, see, e.g., Hansen (2007).
This intuition also holds for learning about competing model speci…cations. Consider two
models, denoted model 0 and model 1, and de…ne an indicator variable, M , such that M = 1
(0) indicates that model 1 (0) is true. The data is then generated from p(yt+1 jM = 0; y t )
or p(yt+1 jM = 1; y t ), where the dependence on y t as a conditioning variable re‡ects the fact
there could be learning about other parameters or state variables within the model. From
the agent’s perspective, M is a random variable whose value can be learned. Given initial
probabilities, p0 = P [M = 0], rational learning generates the posterior pt = P [M = 0jy t ] ;
which is de…ned recursively by Bayes rule as
pt+1 =

p(yt+1 jM = 0; y t )pt
p(yt+1 jM = 0; y t )pt + p(yt+1 jM = 1; y t ) (1

pt )

:

(2)

As in the case of …xed parameter uncertainty, shocks to beliefs regarding the true model
speci…cation (the random variable M ) are martingales and have permanent e¤ects.

When the underlying structural parameters governing consumption dynamics are unknown, parameter learning impacts marginal intertemporal rates of substitution. In particular, revisions in beliefs generate permanent shocks to the conditional distribution of future
consumption, impacting the price-consumption ratio via changes in growth expectations
and/or discount rates. From Equation (4) it is immediate that these shocks are priced risk
factors in this economy.
The rest of the paper quanti…es the impact of various types of parameter uncertainty in
a range of models. We …rst consider the simplest model, where consumption growth is i.i.d.
lognormal, but the mean growth rate is unknown. This case transparently provides intuition
and a sense of magnitudes. We then move on to more interesting consumption dynamics,
including learning about rare events and model uncertainty.

2.1

Relation to existing literature

Our focus on parameter learning connects to a long-standing debate in macroeconomics. One
common critique of rational expectations models assuming perfect knowledge is precisely
the assumption that agents know ‘…xed but unknown’parameters, e.g., Modigliani (1977).
Of course there is nothing about parameter or model learning inconsistent with rational
expectations, as noted by Lucas and Sargent (1978, p. 68)): “... it has been only a matter of
analytical convenience and not of necessity that equilibrium models have used the assumption
of stochastically stationary "shocks" and the assumption that agents have already learned the
probability distributions that they face. Both of these assumptions can be abandoned, albeit
at a cost in terms of the simplicity of the model. . . .While models incorporating Bayesian
learning and stochastic nonstationarity are both technically feasible and consistent with the
equilibrium modeling strategy, almost no successful applied work along these lines has come
to light. One reason is probably that nonstationary time series models are cumbersome and
5

come in so many varieties.” As discussed below, numerical solutions are generally required
and can be quite complicated.
Hansen (2007) stresses the importance of studying how parameter and model uncertainty
impacts asset valuation, forcing economic agents to face the inference problems as econometricians. Hansen (2007), and also Hansen and Sargent (2010), take a robustness approach,
with agents making decisions that are robust to model uncertainty and consider the case
of an EIS of one. In contrast, we focus on Bayesian learning with Epstein-Zin preferences
and consider EIS values di¤erent from unity and also consider the pricing of long-horizon
risky claims— notably claims to the in…nite streams of consumption and dividends, as well
as long-term bonds.
Other related papers considering general equilibrium implications of parameter learning
include Veronesi (2000), Cogley and Sargent (2008), Jobert, Platania, and Rogers (2006),
Benzoni, Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2011), Johannes, Lochstoer, and Mou (2010), and
Kumar and Gvozdeva (2012). Relative to these our paper focuses on the impact of priced
parameter uncertainty on asset price moments in a general equilibrium model with EpsteinZin preferences.3
Pastor and Veronesi (2009, 2012) consider parameter learning applications with power
utility preferences over …nal wealth. As shown in Timmermann (1993) and Lewellen and
Shanken (2002), parameter learning about dividend dynamics induces excess return predictability in in-sample forecasting regressions as typically undertaken in the literature. The
hallmark of the learning channel, however, is poor out-of-sample performance of such regressions, consistent with the data (see Goyal and Welch (2008) and Johannes, Korteweg and
Polson (2013)).
A number of papers consider state uncertainty, where the state evolves discretely via a
Markov chain or smoothly via a Gaussian process.4 Veronesi (2000) considers learning about
mean-dividend growth rates in a power utility setting and focuses on the role of information
quality. Learning about a …xed parameter is a special case, and with common preference
parameters, Veronesi shows that in this case the equity premium falls and could even be
negative when parameters are uncertain.
3

Benzoni, Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2011) also solve for a continuous time general equilibrium
model where there is parameter uncertainty associated with a rare crash-event probability. Their focus
is on explaining the implied option skew however. Kumar and Gvozdeva (2012) also consider a general
equilibrium model with Epstein-Zin preferences and parameter uncertainty, but their numerical solution is
only an approximation to the true problem.

Earlier contributions include Detemple (1986), Dothan and Feldman (1986), and Gennotte (1986) who
show that you can separate the …ltering problem from the pricing problem.

David (1997) consider learning about the level of …rm pro…tability, which is assumed to
switch between two states. Moore and Shaller (1996) consider consumption/dividend based
Markov switching models with state learning and power utility. Veronesi (2004) studies the
implications of learning about a peso state in a Markov switching model with power utility.
David and Veronesi (2010) consider a Markov switching model with learning about states.
Pastor and Veronesi (2003, 2006) study uncertainty about a …xed dividend-growth rate or
pro…tability levels with an exogenously speci…ed pricing kernel, in part motivated in order
to derive cross-sectional implications.
In the case of Epstein-Zin utility, Brandt, Zeng, and Zhang (2004) study alternative
rules for learning about an unknown Markov state, assuming all parameters and the model
is known. Chen and Pakos (2008), Lettau, Ludvigson, and Wachter (2008) and Boguth and
Kuehn (2012) consider economic agents who know parameter values, but learn about states
in a Markov switching consumption based asset pricing model. Ai (2010) studies learning
in a production-based long-run risks model with Kalman learning about a persistent latent
state variable. Bansal and Shaliastovich (2008) and Shaliastovich (2010) consider learning
about the persistent component in a Bansal and Yaron (2004) style model with sub-optimal
Kalman learning.
Alternative preferences with a preference for early resolution of uncertainty will exhibit
similar e¤ects to those we document with parameter learning and Epstein-Zin preferences.
The quantitative e¤ects will of course depend on the utility speci…cation and parameter
assumptions. Examples include general Kreps-Porteus preferences and smooth ambiguity
aversion preferences of Klibano¤, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2009) and Ju and Miao (2012), as
well as the fragile beliefs setup of Hansen and Sargent (2010).5 Strzalecki (2011) discusses of
the relation between ambiguity attitudes and the preference for the timing of the resolution
of uncertainty. Learning under ambiguity (e.g., Epstein and Schneider (2007)) di¤ers from
Bayesian learning as learning under ambiguity depends on the sets of priors entertained by
the agent, with higher weight being given to more pessimistic prior beliefs when forming
predictive distributions.

Benzoni, Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein and Helwege (2010) investigate the implications for credit spreads
of learning under fragile beliefs.

(8)

In words, the agent thinks that consumption growth is normally distributed, but the moments are time-varying and expected consumption growth has a unit root. Compared to
the consumption dynamics in Bansal and Yaron (2004), learning induces truly long-run consumption risks, as the agent perceives expected consumption growth shocks to be permanent
versus Bansal and Yaron’s persistent, but still transitory, shocks.6 The consumption growth
process does not explode, however, as the posterior variance declines over time and will
eventually (at t ! 1) go to zero.
Since actual consumption growth as in Equation (5) is unpredictable, it (trivially) cannot be predicted by, e.g., the price-dividend ratios or risk-free rates. This di¤erence between
the objective long-run risks assumed by Bansal and Yaron, which imply a high degree of
consumption predictability, and subjective long-run risks arising endogenously through pa6

In Bansal and Yaron, conditional expected consumption growth follows an AR(1) with a monthly autoregression coe¢ cient of 0.979.

rameter learning, is empirically relevant. One critique of long-run risk models is that they
imply an implausible degree of consumption predictability (see Beeler and Campbell (2012)).
From the example presented here it is clear that such critique is not valid for long-run risks
induced by parameter learning.

3.1

Asset price implications when EIS = 1

When = 1 and in continuous-time, there is an analytical solution for the value function,
the details of which are given in the Online Appendix.7 This generates simple expressions
for central asset pricing quantities and provides intuition for understanding the general equilibrium e¤ects of structural parameter uncertainty with Epstein-Zin preferences.
The continuous-time equivalent of Equation (5) is
dct =

t dt

+ dzt ,

where dzt are innovations to a standard Brownian motion under the agent’s …ltration and the
hyperparameters, t and At (the state variables in this economy), evolve via d t = At dzt
and dAt = A2t dt. In continuous-time, the volatility of consumption growth (short-run risk)
is the same as in a full-information economy. The log value function (vt ) is (see Online
Appendix):

respectively. The …rst terms in each expression are the familiar power utility terms, and the

In subsequent models, it will be necessary to resort to numerical solutions and therefore we move back to
a discrete-time setting shortly. The results do not hinge on the distinction between discrete and continuous
time.

second terms are generated by learning. The quantitative impact of learning is therefore
1
a function of (i) the preference for the timing of resolution of uncertainty,
, (ii)
the duration of the belief shock in terms of its e¤ect on utility, 1= ~ , and (iii) the size of
shocks to beliefs, At . Intuitively, a preference for early resolution of uncertainty ( > 1= )
is needed for learning to increase risk. The extra risks arising from parameter learning and a
preference for early resolution of uncertainty come from updating beliefs and not from a fattailed conditional distribution of consumption growth–the subjective distribution is normal.
This is di¤erent from Geweke (2002) and Weitzman (2007), who note that learning about
in discrete-time induces a fat-tailed predictive distribution for consumption.
3.1.1

Asset pricing implications and the speed of learning

Equation (10) implies that when = 1 important moments like pricing kernel volatility and
the risk premium have a constant loading on the amount of parameter uncertainty. With
a preference for an early resolution of uncertainty, parameter learning clearly increases the
Sharpe ratio and risk premium. However, since Bayesian learning is e¢ cient, one might think
that parameter learning e¤ects are small and disappear quickly. Indeed, since dAt = A2t dt
and assuming A0 = 1, we obtain At = (1 + t) 1 . Thus, the ex ante magnitude of the shock
to beliefs about the mean growth rate (At ), declines at a rate (1 + t) 1 .
However, with parameter learning, even if the size of the belief shock is small, the e¤ect
is permanent and so the e¤ect on continuation utility can still be large. As an example,
consider a quarterly calibration with time-preference and risk aversion as in Bansal and
Yaron (2004): ~ = ln 0:994 and = 10. The multiplier on the amount of parameter
uncertainty is extremely large, (
1) = ~ = 1; 495: This implies that even after learning for
100 years, the annualized Sharpe ratio and risk premium are 1:37 times or 37% larger than
the corresponding quantities in the full-information or known parameters case.8 With a 200
(300) years long training sample, the increase is 19% (12%). Thus, there is a quantitatively
large and long-lasting magni…cation of macroeconomic risks. This is one of our primary
results. In contrast, in the case of = 1= = 1 (log utility), the agent is indi¤erent to
the timing of resolution of uncertainty and there are no e¤ects of parameter learning on the
risk-premium or Sharpe ratio.
It is also important to note that the speed of learning slows over time. Measuring time
t in quarters (consistent with the quarterly model calibration), the conditional volatility of

shocks to the mean beliefs about declines by a factor of 400 over the …rst one hundred
years of learning, but the rate is not uniform. In the …rst 10 years of learning, volatility
declines by a factor of 40. From year 10 to 50 by a factor of 5, and from years 50 to 100
and years 100 to year 200; the volatility declines only by a factor of 2. Thus the speed of
learning slows. This is why the asset pricing impact of parameter learning persists for a very
long time, even in this simple model.
At this stage, note that when learning about a …xed parameter, the amount of parameter
uncertainty will typically, and in this case certainly, decline with time, implying time-trends
in asset prices. While one can argue that the market Sharpe ratio and risk premium overall
has declined over the available historical sample (see, e.g., Fama and French (2000)), one
can reasonably rule out declines greater than, say, a factor of 5.9 Thus, the reasonability of
a prior can be assessed in part by whether it implies excessive learning (time-trends) over
samples such as those we have available relative to observed asset price behavior.

which are driven by t , a martingale, and At ; which decreases deterministically over time.
Thus, future risk-free rates are always expected to be higher than current risk-free rates, suggesting an upward-sloping term structure. However, the risk premium on bonds is negative,
as low realized consumption growth decreases t , which, in turn, decreases the risk-free rate
and increases bond prices. The slope of the term structure depends on the relative magnitude of the risk premium and the increase in future expected short-rates from the decreasing
precautionary savings (At ).

future short-rates roughly nets to zero, and the yield curve is ‡at. In contrast, the Bansal
and Yaron (2004) model generates a strongly downward-sloping term structure, which Beeler
and Campbell (2012) argue is counter-factual.

3.2

Asset pricing implications when EIS > 1

The case of EIS 6= 1 is discussed in detail in the Online Appendix, and we brie‡y summarize the implications. When the substitution e¤ect dominates the wealth e¤ect (i.e., when
EIS > 1), the price-consumption ratio increases upon a positive revision of the beliefs about
the growth rate. Overall, the primary e¤ect of increasing the EIS is an increase in excess
return volatility, which, in turn, increases the risk premium, both of which are important
for matching historical asset price data. Further, the impact of parameter learning on the
pricing kernel changes over time: the volatility of the pricing kernel decreases at a slower rate
over time when the EIS is high than when it is low. This is due to an endogenous increase
in the sensitivity of the price-consumption ratio to belief updates. This occurs as discount
rates decrease over the sample, which makes the price-consumption ratio more sensitive to
updates in the expected growth rate (see Pastor and Veronesi (2004)).
Importantly, these e¤ects combine to imply that the risk premium on the consumption
claim after 100 years of learning is almost twice as the risk premium in a full-information,
known parameter economy when EIS = 2, while the price of risk is almost 1.5 times higher
and the return volatility is 1.24 times higher than in the known parameter economy. Further,
as highlighted in Lewellen and Shanken (2002), learning generates excess return predictability
in standard, in-sample forecasting regressions.

Asset pricing implications of unknown volatilities

The Online Appendix, for completeness, also analyzes learning about 2 in the simple i.i.d.
consumption growth case in a discrete time economy. Bakshi and Skoulakis (2010) note that
12

uncertain variance with reasonable truncation bounds for the support of the distribution
leads to negligible e¤ects on the price of risk in a power utility setting. Since learning about
the variance parameter also generates shocks to continuation utility, it is not clear this result
holds when agents have a preference for early resolution of uncertainty. However, as learning
about a constant volatility parameter is more rapid than about a mean parameter, and since
volatility is a second-order e¤ect in terms of utility, the asset pricing e¤ects of learning about
the volatility of shocks become quickly very small with Epstein-Zin preferences.

3.4

Discussion

The analytical solution cleanly shows how parameter uncertainty in conjunction with a
preference for early resolution of uncertainty can be a powerful ampli…cation mechanism for
the pricing of macro shocks. Parameter uncertainty generates quantitatively large and longlasting e¤ects and helps in understanding many of puzzling observations such as the high
equity premium and Sharpe ratio, as well as the shape of the yield curve. Furthermore, the
subjective nature of the long-run risks induced by parameter learning means that neither the
risk-free rate nor valuation ratios (e.g., the price-dividend ratio) forecast future consumption
growth. In particular, the high EIS and time-varying risk-free rate in this model are entirely
consistent with estimates of the EIS close to zero obtained from Hall (1988)–type regressions,
as actual consumption growth is i.i.d. and thus unpredictable.10
Of course, the i.i.d. normal model is overly simplistic as a description of actual consumption dynamics. We consider next parameter uncertainty in more realistic models, where
learning is likely to take a long time and where asset pricing implications of parameter uncertainty are large. In particular, we consider learning about rare events such as the Great
Depression, and also a case of model uncertainty where two models with very di¤erent asset
pricing implications are hard to di¤erentiate using available macroeconomic data.

Learning about rare events

Markov switching models have been widely used in consumption based asset pricing, both
for their ‡exibility and their analytical tractability (see, e.g., Mehra and Prescott (1986) and
10

The fact that the Hall-regression does not uncover the EIS of economic agents is also a feature in
Garleanu and Panageas (2012), who show that long-run risk in individual consumption growth rates, with
corresponding time-variation in the risk-free rate, are generated from optimal consumption sharing with
heterogeneous agents even when aggregate consumption is i.i.d.

13

Rietz (1988)). Since the …nancial crisis, there has been a renewed interest in using these
models to capture particularly bad periods economic periods like the Great Depression, commonly called consumption disasters. These models provide a particularly useful laboratory,
as it is hard to learn about the parameters governing rare events and these parameters have
particularly strong asset pricing implications.
It is di¢ cult to estimate the frequency, severity, and length of consumption disasters or
depressions. In fact, even using centuries of data and a broad panel of countries, Barro,
Nakamura, Steinsson, and Ursua (BNSU, 2011) report signi…cant uncertainty in parameter
estimates in formal models. They estimate a consumption disaster frequency of 2:8% per
year and a probability of exiting a disaster is 13:5% per year. The standard errors are high:
e.g., a 2 standard-error bound for the average duration of the bad state is between 4:5 and
9 years. There is also a large amount of uncertainty over the size (mean and variance) of
consumption disasters.
To investigate the impact of parameter learning in rare events models, we consider a
two-state Markov switching model:
ct =
where "t

N (0; 1), st is a 2-state observed Markov chain with transition matrix:

Without any loss of generality, we label st = 1 the ‘good’or normal state and st = 2 the ‘bad’
or rare event state. With i; j 2 f1; 2g and i 6= j, the unconditional or ergodic probability of
state i is

(14)
P [st = i] =

We separately consider the cases of unknown transition probabilities (Section 4.1) and
uncertain means/variances (Section 4.2) to understand the role of di¤erent types of parameter
uncertainty while keeping the size of the state-space manageable.

Uncertain transition probabilities
The Learning Problem

Assume the transition matrix is unknown and conjugate, Beta-distributed priors ii
(ai;0 ; bi;0 ), for i = 1; 2. Under the assumption that st is observed, the posterior distribution
for the transition probabilities depends only on the state counts, which makes the learning
problem particularly tractable.11 De…ning the observed states up to time t as st = (s1 ; :::; st ),
the posterior distribution is ii jst
(ai;t ; bi;t ), where
ai;t = ai;0 +

and vart (

:
(ai;t + bi;t )2 (ai;t + bi;t + 1)

In calibrating the priors, we consider a range of historical experiences that are easy to
incorporate given the conjugate structure. Our priors are unbiased, as our focus is on the
e¤ects of priced parameter uncertainty and not biased beliefs (see, e.g., Cogley and Sargent
(2008) for biased priors). Thus, the priors parameters imply the number of prior transitions
coincides with the true ergodic probability of the corresponding regime from equation (14).
Given the true values of 11 and 22 , the priors and posteriors are functions of numbers of
years of observations, T0 .
We consider priors corresponding to 100, 200, or 300 years of quarterly observations.
After 200 years of observations starting from a ‡at prior, the posterior standard deviation
of 22 is very close to the corresponding standard error reported in BNSU. Since BNSU
arrive at this standard error after having used the last 100 years of data in the estimation,
we choose the prior based on 100 years of observations as our benchmark for understanding
asset prices over this past century. The prior based on 300 years of learning is added as a very
conservative case and would assume that the agent began learning early in the 1600s, close
to the opening year for the world’s …rst stock exchange – the Amsterdam Stock Exchange
(1611).
11

If both the parameters and state are unobserved, the learning problem becomes intractable as the
parameter posteriors require computing every possible combination of observed states and their probabilities.

4.1.2

Calibration

The remaining model parameters are calibrated to match the U.S. consumption data over
the century. The bad state is calibrated to the Great Depression, when real, per capita
log consumption declined 4:6% per year from 1929 to 1933 with 2:94% volatility per year
( 2 = 1:15% and 2 = 1:47% at a quarterly frequency). We set 11 = 0:9975 and 22 =
0:9375, corresponding to one 4-year depression per century. In the normal growth state,
1 = 0:54% and 1 = 0:98%, generating a time-averaged, annual log consumption growth
mean and standard deviation of 1:8% and 2:2%, respectively, matching the observed values
(from NIPA) from 1929 to 2011.
We price a dividend claim to compare to market returns and assume
dt+1 =

+ ( ct+1

)+

d t+1 ;

(16)

where dt is the log of dividends, is the unconditional mean consumption growth rate, is
a leverage parameter, and t is an i.i.d. standard normal shock (independent of "t ). This
ensures the long-run growth rate of dividends and consumption is the same, while the shortrun response of dividends to consumption shocks is higher than that of consumption. Using
the 1929 to 2011 sample, we estimate the leverage parameter to be 2:5 by regressing annual
real dividend growth (constructed from CRSP data) on annual consumption growth.
In terms of exposure to parameter uncertainty, our dividend assumption is conservative
relative to the more standard speci…cation, dt+1 =
ct+1 + d t+1 .12 Alternatively, one
could assume consumption and dividends are cointegrated, which introduces another state
variable and is computationally costly. We set the idiosyncratic volatility d such that annual
dividend volatility is 11:5%, as in Bansal and Yaron (2004). The model is solved numerically
using a backwards recursion method where the known parameters economies are used as
boundary conditions (see the Online Appendix for more details).13
We consider a range of preference parameters, but a preference for an early resolution
of uncertainty, > 1= . In our main calibration, we choose values for and commonly
used in the long-run risks literature and set to match the level of the risk-free rate. This
generates = 2, = 0:994 (as in Bansal and Yaron (2004)), and = 3:9. We consider
12

In particular, the uncertainty about the long-run growth rate is the same for consumption and dividend,
= E (s1 ) 1 + (1 E (s1 )) 2 .
13
The case of learning about transition probabilities when the regimes are observed can be solved particularly fast. While the Appendix gives more details as to why, we note here that this model therefore is well
suited as a workhorse model for macro-…nance applications.

Results

Given these priors, we compute standard asset pricing moments for a ‘typical’long sample
(100 years) by averaging across 20,000 simulated sample moments. We also feed the regime
transitions corresponding to the U.S. historical experience from 1911 to 2010 into the model
to understand how conditional asset pricing moments (such as the conditional risk premium
and return volatility) respond to the Great Depression and, later, to the Great Recession.
Unconditional Moments
Panel A of Table 1 reports the average risk premium, return volatility, and Sharpe ratio
for a year sample, as well as the level and volatility of the real risk-free rate (all in logs). The
‘Data’ column contains corresponding observed equity market moments for the U.S. from
1929 to 2011 (from CRSP). The real risk-free rate moments are from BY (2004).
As mentioned earlier, the T0 = 100 years prior is our benchmark, which implies that
the level of remaining parameter uncertainty after 100 years of observed data is consistent
with the uncertainty in BNSU’s parameter estimates. The average risk premium is 5:7%,
somewhat higher than its historical counterpart (5:1%), achieved with a 16% return volatility,
compared to 20% in the data. The Sharpe ratio of simple annual excess returns is 0:39,
slightly higher than in the data (0:36). The known parameters case (T0 = 1) generates a
risk premium of 1:1% and a Sharpe ratio of 0:14; both well below their observed counterparts,
and a much higher risk-free rate. For the alternative cases with 200 and 300 years of prior
learning, the risk premium only falls slightly to 4:9% and 4:3%, respectively. In fact, the
model with the tightest prior (T0 = 300 years) can also match the risk premium if is
increased to 0:9952 to match the risk-free rate level (right column of Panel A Table 1).
In sum, learning is slow and the quantitative e¤ect of parameter learning on the risk
premium and Sharpe ratio are very large for a range of reasonable priors. It is remarkable
that the model can match the equity premium and Sharpe ratio, as well as the risk-free rate,
with a level of risk aversion of only 3:9 and an unconditional consumption volatility of 2:2%,
consistent with U.S. consumption data. By comparison, Bansal and Yaron (2004) match
the risk premium with relative risk aversion and consumption volatility calibrated to 10 and
2:7%, respectively.
Panel B of Table 1 reports results for = 1:1. The risk premium with 100 years of prior
observations decreases from 5:7% to 4:1%. The Sharpe ratio falls only slightly from 0:39 to

0:35, but the level of the risk-free rate increases signi…cantly with a lower EIS. The volatility
of the price-consumption and price-dividend ratios are also lower. Thus, a high level of
the EIS is helpful in terms of matching the standard moments in models with parameter
uncertainty. For the more precise priors (T0 = 200 years and T0 = 300 years), there is a
modest decline in the risk premiums and increase in the risk free rate relative to the case
18

when T0 = 100 years, similar to the dynamics from the high EIS case.
Conditional Moments using regime changes from 1911 to 2010
To mimic the U.S. historical experience, we feed into the model a path of states corresponding to the 1911 to 2010 sample. We designate the NBER dates for the Great Depression
and the Great Recession as realizations of the bad state, with the remaining quarters are
assumed to be draws from the good state. The Great Recession was not as severe as the
Great Depression, though there were extensive fears in its early stages that it may become
a depression-like event.14
Figure 1 reports the mean beliefs about the transition probabilities for this case. From
1910 to 1929, the probability of remaining in the good state ( 11 ) increased slowly, while
the belief about the persistence of the Depression state ( 22 ) was not updated as there
were no observations from which to learn. When the Depression starts in 1929, Et [ 11 ]
is sharply revised downwards, and Et [ 22 ] increases during the Depression. At the end of
the Depression, Et [ 22 ] is revised downwards as the length of this Depression now has been
resolved. From 1934 and onwards the pattern repeats as Et [ 11 ] increases slowly until the
onset of the Great Recession. Since the Great Recession was quite short, Et [ 22 ] is revised
downwards upon exit from the recession. Figure 2 shows how these belief dynamics are
re‡ected in conditional asset price moments. Abrupt shifts and then trending beliefs are
hallmarks of learning about rare events.
The wealth-consumption ratio (upper left panel of Figure 2) decreases strongly when
the bad state is realized, and continues to decrease until the bad state is exited. Given a
preference for early resolution of uncertainty and the stochastic discount factor, this event
is very risky, strongly increasing marginal utility. This is due both to a lower consumption
growth rate in a Depression, as well as increased risk coming from updates about the persistence of the bad state. The latter is re‡ected in the di¤erence between the dashed blue line,
the case with parameter uncertainty, and the solid red line, the benchmark case of known
parameters. The wealth-consumption ratio is lower in the case with parameter uncertainty,
re‡ecting higher discount rates, and it also falls more conditional on the bad state.
The real risk-free rate level (upper right panel of Figure 2) in both the models with

The sample also contain 400 shocks to quarterly consumption growth ("’s), which are random, antithetic
draws from a standard normal, normalized to have unit variance. We do not use actual consumption data
here as the pre-WW2 sample only has annual consumption data. In any case, the realized consumption
shocks have no impact on the evolution of either the wealth-consumption or the price-dividend ratios in this
model.

Forecasters, decreased by about 5:5% from right before the Financial Crisis to the end of
the event. In the Great Depression the nominal rate did decrease by about 6%, but in‡ation
expectations are not available for this period. Realized in‡ation was, however, at some points
negative, indicating that the real rate decreased less than the nominal rate or possibly even
increased. On the other hand, the nominal rate was hitting the zero lower bound at this
point, so it is unclear how to relate this data to the frictionless economy presented here.

Figure 2: The …gure shows conditional moments from the 2-state switching regime model where
the transition probabilties are unknown and where the regimes are based on the U.S. macro data

while the solid line corresponds to the case with known transition probabilities. The preference
parameters are = 0:994, = 3:9, = 2.

The two bottom panels of Figure 2 display the conditional, annualized risk premium
and return volatility of the dividend claim. With parameter uncertainty, the risk premium
and return volatility increase to more than 40% and 80%, respectively, at the onset of the
bad state. Thereafter, both quantities decreased during the Depression, as the agent learns
about the persistence of the bad state. This decreasing return volatility is consistent with
recent experience over the …nancial crisis, both looking at realized volatility and the VIX
index. When the parameters are known, the conditional risk premium and return volatility

stay constant through the depression at 18% and 52%, respectively. For comparison, Martin
(2012) argues that the risk premium at the onset of the …nancial crises exceeded 55%. Both
realized market volatility and the VIX index showed volatility in excess of 80% at the same
time. Realized volatility in the fall of 1929 also exceeded 80%.15

Table 2 reports sample moments feeding in realized states. The return volatility with
parameter uncertainty is over this period 20:96%, relative to the observed volatility of 20:21%.

Here realized volatility is calculated as the annualized value of the square root of realized daily variance
over a month.

It is higher than the average reported across simulated economies in Table 1 due to the
presence of two crises in the sample. Table 2 also reports the correlation between annual
log consumption growth and market returns. With parameter uncertainty, this correlation
is 0:30, while with known transition probabilities this correlation is 0:36. In the data, from
1929 to 2011 as available from the BEA, this correlation is 0:65.16
The drop in the price-dividend ratio of the dividend claim at the onset of the bad state is
55% in the model with parameter uncertainty and 50% in the model with known transition
probabilities. In the Great Depression the drop in the price-dividend ratio from the beginning
of the Depression in 1929 to its lowest point in 1932 was 79%. For the recent Financial Crisis,
the corresponding drop was 50%.
In sum, the model with a depression state calibrated to consumption dynamics under
the U.S. Great Depression performs well along a number of dimensions when compared to
relevant moments from the data. In particular, it predicts a high unconditional risk premium
and a low risk-free rate, along with a very high risk premium and return volatility in the
crisis period, and only requires a relative risk aversion coe¢ cient of 3:9. Relative to the
benchmark case with known transition probabilities, parameter uncertainty increases the
Sharpe ratio and the risk premium by factors of about 2:5 and 5, respectively.
Alternative Calibrations of Consumption Dynamics in the Depression State.
Table 3 shows results for alternative calibrations of the consumption dynamics in the
Depression state. The original calibration used the NBER dating of the Great Depression
(1929 1933) and the annual, real, per capita consumption data from BEA as the basis
for the calibration of the persistence of the bad state, as well as the mean and volatility of
consumption growth in this state. The 2-state regime switching model as calibrated here
does not account for any reversal phase with strong growth after a Depression has ended.
The high consumption growth of 5:4% in 1934 is consistent with such a reversal. The total
drop in consumption in the years 1929 1933 was 18%, while the decrease from 1929 to 1934
was 13%; and from 1929 to 1935 it was "only" 9%.
To assess the robustness of the results with respect to the calibration of the consumption
dynamics in this bad state, we also consider calibrations based on a 5- and 6-year Depression,

This correlation is obtained using the beginning-of-period timing for consumption, given the timeaveraging of the consumption data (see Working (1960) and Campbell (1999)). That is, reported consumption growth for year t is correlated with returns for year t 1. The correlation between consumption
growth reported for year t and returns in year t, corresponding to using the end-of-period timing when
calculating consumption growth, is 0:18.

The true quarterly persistence of the bad state is then 0:95 or 0:9583, with corresponding
quarterly means of 0:65% and 0:39%. The corresponding quarterly volatilities (where
volatility is as before adjusted for the time-averaging of the consumption data) are 3:01%

Table 3 shows that the risk premium and Sharpe ratio are both decreasing in the alternative calibrations, as the mean state is less severe. For the 4-year benchmark calibration,
the risk premium is 5:7%, whereas it is 4:1% and 3:0% in the 5- and 6-year calibrations,
respectively. The risk-free rate increases in these calibrations for the same reason. The …nal
column of Table 3 shows a calibration of the model with a 6-year Depression state where
the time-preference parameter ( ) has been increased from 0:994 to 0:996 such that the level
of the risk-free rate is on par with the data. In this case, the risk premium and Sharpe
24

ratio of the least risky, 6-year calibration are increased to 4:1% and 0:32, respectively. The
Sharpe ratio is on par with that observed historically. The corresponding case with known
parameters is shown in parentheses. Here the risk premium and Sharpe ratio are 0:9% and
0:13, respectively. We conclude from this that the overall implications of the parameter
uncertainty model are robust to alternative, reasonable calibrations of the Depression state,
in particular the strong increase in relevant asset pricing quantities such as the risk premium
and the Sharpe ratio relative to the benchmark known parameters case.

4.2

Uncertain mean and variance of the Depression state

In an experiment detailed in the online Appendix, we consider the case where the transition probabilities are known, but where instead the mean and variance parameters of the
Depression state ( 2 and 2 ) are unknown. To summarize the results, learning about the
mean growth rate in the Depression state increases the risk premium by a factor of about 2
relative to the known mean benchmark case. Learning about the variance in the bad state
has only negligible impact on asset pricing moments.17
We next turn to a case of model uncertainty that generates interesting dynamics in
the price of risk and risk premium at the business cycle frequency. Since business cycles
are observed more frequently, learning can only be slow if the two models are very hard to
distinguish using available macro samples, which is exactly the case in the following analysis.

5

Learning about competing model speci…cations

In this section, we investigate an economy where agents face uncertainty over the model
speci…cation. As discussed earlier, model uncertainty can be viewed as uncertainty about
an ‘indicator’parameter, M , that equals one for the true model and zero for an alternative
model. Here, we consider an agent who is uncertainty between the Bansal and Yaron (BY,
2004) model (M = 0) with homoskedastic shocks and a normally distributed i.i.d model
(M = 1).18 This is a natural framework to evaluate model uncertainty for two reasons: (1)
17

We truncate the support of the mean and the variance parameters to ensure existence of equilibrium.
See the online Appendix for details.
18
A similar problem was considered in Hansen and Sargent (2010), though their alternative model is not
the iid case, but a case where there is still positive, but less autocorrelation in consumption growth than in the
long-run risk model. Also, our focus is on the quantitative implications of rational learning for long-horizon
claims when the agent has Epstein-Zin preferences. Ju and Miao (2012) and Collard, Mukerji, Sheppard,
and Tallon (2011) consider di¤erent cases of model uncertainty under smooth ambiguity aversion.

25

the predictable component in the BY model is highly persistent and di¢ cult to detect over
even modestly sized samples; and (2) the asset pricing implications of the models are quite
di¤erent.

The agent initially assumes p0 = P (M = 0), and updates beliefs via Bayes rule:
pt+1 = P M = 0jy t+1 / p yt+1 jy t ; M = 0 pt :

(18)

The probabilities are martingales. Letting p(yt+1 jy t ; M = 0) = pBY (yt+1 jy t ) and p (yt+1 jy t ; M = 1) =
piid (yt+1 ), the belief recursion is
pt+1 =

(19)

where pBY (yt+1 jy t ) N ( + x^t ; 2BY + 2x ) and piid (yt+1 ) N ( ; 2iid ). The value function
normalized by consumption is a function of pt and x^t and is computed numerically using
value function iteration, with boundary values given by the cases pt = 0 and pt = 1. See the
Online Appendix for more details on the numerical solution methodology.

Results and calibration

We calibrate the consumption dynamics based on Bansal and Yaron (2004) at a quarterly
frequency, since we will later feed actual consumption realizations. In particular, = 0:45%,
= 0:9793 , BY = iid , and ' = 0:089. This implies that ^ BY = 1:706% and
iid = 1:65%,
26

'
^ = 0:044: The values for and '
^ are the same as the values for and ' assumed in Bansal
and Yaron (2004). In other words, the amount of long-run risk as perceived by the agent
learning about xt from consumption growth is the same as that for the agent in Bansal and
Yaron (2004) who observes xt . Given the discussion in the previous section, we assume an
EIS greater than one. In our main calibration, we set = 2 and calibrate = 0:9963 and
= 9 such that we match the level of the equity market risk premium and risk-free rate.

Figure 3: The …gure shows the annualized, conditional price of risk in the economy where the agent
is unsure whether true consumption growth is iid or follows the dynamics in Case 1 in Bansal and
Yaron (2004) –the homoskedastic case. The state variables are the current belief about the model
pt , where pt = 1 means the agent is certain the BY model is the true model, and x
^t –the current
belief about expected consumption growth, conditional on the BY model being the correct model.

When pt = 1, the agent is certain the BY economy is the true speci…cation, in which
27

case, the annualized price of risk is constant and equal to 0:51.19 In the i.i.d. case, pt = 0,
the price of risk is 0:30. For pt 2 (0; 1) the price of risk is di¤erent than a simple weighted
average of the two boundary case economies–a crucial feature of priced model uncertainty.
In particular, at x^t = 0, the price of risk remains close to, and in fact slightly higher than,
0:51 even for values of pt close to zero. Thus, even if the BY model is very unlikely, the agent
still perceives the economy to be much riskier than the i.i.d. case for two reasons. First,
shocks to model beliefs are permanent and therefore have a large impact on the continuation
utility, provided the two models have di¤erent continuation utilities (which is clearly the
case here). Second, as pt declines, the event that the BY model is the true model has an
impact similar to a ‘disaster’scenario. This occurs because the distribution of continuation
utility becomes increasingly negatively skewed as pt decreases, and such negative skewness
is disliked by risk averse agents with preferences for early resolution of uncertainty.
Unconditionally, the BY model generates lower utility than the iid model, and this difference increases when x^t < 0, as future expected consumption growth rates are lower than
the i.i.d. model. Thus, model uncertainty is ‘worse’in these states of the world, generating
a higher conditional price of risk. Further, the two risks in the economy, the shock to consumption and the update in the model probability, reinforce each other in these states. A low
consumption growth is bad also in the iid model. However, when x^t < 0, a low consumption
growth realization also increases the likelihood of the BY model. In fact, Figure 3 shows that
when pt = 0:05 and x^t is three standard deviations below its mean, the price of risk is about
1:10, almost twice that of the riskiest alternative model of the world. On the other hand,
when x^t > 0 the updates in beliefs hedge the consumption shock in the following sense. A
low consumption realization is bad (which is also the case in the iid model), but since x^t > 0,
the low consumption growth increases the likelihood that the iid model is the true model,
which is a good in a utility sense. Therefore, the total price of risk in these states can drop
below that of either of the limiting economies. In fact, when pt = 0:05 and when xt is three
standard deviations above its mean, the annualized price of risk is only 0:06.
Model uncertainty generates counter-cyclical risk prices, as x^t tends to be low/high in
recessions/expansions. Figure 3 also show the tenuous nature of the rational expectations
assumption (see also Hansen (2007)). It is not until pt gets lower than 0:01% that the
asset pricing implications of model uncertainty are negligible, which, would take agents on
19

In the exactly solved Bansal and Yaron model, the price of risk actually varies a tiny amount with x
^t ,
but to the third decimal it is constant, as in the approximate solution for the homoskedastic case given in
Bansal and Yaron (2004).

28

average about 800 years to learn starting from the initial prior p0 = 0:5. In sum, one
cannot outright dismiss a model as unimportant even though it is rejected by the data at
conventional signi…cance levels–a point commonly made in the robustness literature. This
conclusion does depend on the agent having a preference for the timing of the resolution of
uncertainty, but as we show below, it does not rely on a high EIS. A model with an EIS
close to one, for instance, delivers similar dynamics. Power utility preferences, however, are
una¤ected by model uncertainty and the price of risk is constant at .20
5.1.2

Asset price moments

As in the previous case, the endogenous sensitivity to the learning dynamics generates strong
and long-lasting asset pricing implications even though agents are rational Bayesian learners.
Figure 4 shows the conditional risk premium, Sharpe ratio, and return volatility of the
dividend claim (see Equation(16)), as well as the model probability (pt ) plotted against
time passed since the initial prior. The …gure shows these moments averaged across 20,000
simulated economies where the initial beliefs are set to p0 = 0:5 and x^0 = 0 and where the
true model is assumed to be the i.i.d. model (i.e., pt=1 = 0). The corresponding moments
from each of the boundary economies are plotted as well.
After 100 years of learning the average model probability decreases from 0:5 to 0:17.
Though the agent updates in the direction of the true model, learning is slow as it is di¢ cult
to discriminate between the two models. Despite downweighting the likelihood of the BY
model, the asset pricing moments are close to the corresponding values in the BY economy. In
fact, the risk premium and Sharpe ratio are only very slightly lower than in the BY model,
and barely decrease with time. In contrast to the initial case discussed earlier (learning
about the mean growth rate with EIS = 1), the asset pricing moments are highly nonlinearly
related to the variance of beliefs, which is pt (1 pt ) and which decline substantially over
time, starting at 0:25 when pt = 0:5 and ending at 0:146 when pt = 0:17. The intuition
is similar to that for the price of risk, as given in Figure 3. The endogenous sensitivity of
continuation utility to belief shocks increases as pt declines, due to the increased negative
skewness in model risk.
Table 4 shows average 100-year sample moments for four di¤erent calibrations corresponding to combinations of the EIS and initial model probability:
2 f1:1; 2g and
20

Basically, it is
1= that matters for the pricing of shocks to the continuation utility. With = 9
this magnitude is 8:5 if = 2, but only falls to 7 if = 0:5. Thus, the main implications shown here are
robust to the level of the IES, as long as is not very close to 1= .

consumption growth and market returns, which in the data, from 1929 to 2011 is 0:65.21

This correlation is computed using the beginning-of-period timing for consumption, given the timeaveraging of the consumption data (see Working (1960) and Campbell (1999)). That is, reported consumption
growth for year t is correlated with returns for year t 1. The correlation between consumption growth
reported for year t and returns in year t, corresponding to using the end-of-period timing when calculating
consumption growth, is 0:18.

The ’Model I’column summarizes the case with initial model uncertainty, p0 , set to 0:5
and = 2. The model undershoots volatility somewhat (14:44% versus 20:21% in the data),
but otherwise matches these unconditional moments quite well. In fact, the moments are
very similar to the moments in the BY model, despite the true model here being the i.i.d.
model. In contrast, the i.i.d. model does a poor job in asset pricing. The ’Model II’column
keeps the prior the same, but decreases to 1:1. The risk premium and return volatility both
decrease somewhat (to 4:65% and 13:94%, respectively), but overall the model does quite
well. In fact, as the risk-free rate here is a little too high, the model admits a calibration
with a higher , which as seen in Equation (10) increases the risk premium and Sharpe
ratio when there is parameter uncertainty. Thus, the implications of model uncertainty as
considered here are robust to the level of the EIS, as long as it is above 1.22
22

With an IES < 1, the return volatility decreases faster, making excess volatility too small. Also, as

31

The column ’Model III’in Table 4 shows the asset pricing moments for the case when
the prior belief that the Bansal-Yaron model is the true model is low, p0 = 0:1. The asset
pricing moments look largely the same, although volatility is increased slightly. This is
in line with the discussion regarding the price of risk (Figure 1), which shows that as the
probability declines, the sensitivity of the continuation utility to updates in beliefs is higher,
even though the variance of beliefs is decreased substantially in this case: 0:09 versus 0:25
in the case when p0 = 0:5.
5.1.3

Feeding the model actual consumption data

Finally, we consider the impact of model uncertainty on the post-WW2 sample using the
corresponding time series of U.S. quarterly, real, per capita consumption growth. To be
consistent with the model, we …rst remove autocorrelation of 0.25 induced by time-averaging
of the data (see Working (1960)) and then normalize the sample mean and variance of this
modi…ed consumption growth series to have mean and variance as assumed in the model
calibration.23
The solid line in the top graph in Figure 5 shows the posterior probability of the Bansal
and Yaron model, P(M = 0jyt+1 ), from 1947Q3 to 2010Q4, starting with an initial probability
of 0:5. The model probabilities vary quite a bit, from about 0:25 to 0:9. Periods with long
runs of either high consumption growth (late 1960’s) or low consumption growth (the Great
Recession) increase the probability of the Bansal and Yaron model relative to the iid model.
At the end of the sample, the likelihood of the Bansal and Yaron model is 0:9 at its maximum.
The dashed line shows the case where the initial model probability is set to 0:1. The dynamics
are largely the same, but the probability is of course shifted down relative to the earlier case.
In this case, the probability of the Bansal-Yaron model at the end of the sample is about
0:45.
The middle plot of Figure 5 shows the conditional price of risk, which varies substantially
and is overall counter-cyclical. However, there are cases where this is not the case. For
instance, in the expansion of the late 1960’s the price of risk increases as the Bansal and
Yaron model becomes more likely. Through the recession of 2001, on the other hand, the
price of risk decreases as the Bansal and Yaron model becomes more likely. This is due
emphasized in Drechsler and Yaron (2010), and IES > 1 is needed to explain the variance risk premium.
23
We …rst construct yt = ct 0:25
ct 1 , using actual real per capita quarterly consumption growth
data from Q2 in 1947 to Q4 in 2010. The modi…ed consumption growth series is then constructed as
fct
+ iid yt TE[yT t[y] t ] , where ET [ ] and T [ ] denote the sample mean and variance, respectively.

32

to the then current high value of x^t , arising from high growth in the 1990’s. As can be
seen from Figure 3, the high current x^t makes the prospect of facing the Bansal and Yaron
consumption dynamics a conditionally less risky prospect as the agent then can enjoy higher
expected consumption growth than in the iid case. For the case with p0 = 0:5, the price of
risk in this sample reaches its maximum of roughly 0:7 during the Great Recession, and its
lowest point close to 0:4 in the mid 1960s. Corresponding to the dynamics apparent from
Figure 3, the price of risk in fact becomes more volatile with p0 = 0:1. Now, the price of
risk is about 0:9 during the …nancial crisis about 0:2 in the mid 60s. The bottom graph of
Figure 5 shows that the conditional risk premium on the levered consumption claim largely
inherits the dynamics of the price of risk. The conditional, annualized risk premium varies
substantially throughout the sample, from about 4% to 8% when p0 = 0:5 and 1% to 9%
when p0 = 0:1.
Overall, model learning leads to interesting risk price and equity premium dynamics,
even though both candidate models are homoskedastic and exhibit constant risk premiums
and Sharpe ratios. As in the earlier example, model learning has long-lasting, quantitatively
signi…cant implications for standard asset pricing moments. This is due to the martingale
shocks, as well as the large di¤erence in the utility continuation values implied by the two
models, and to the endogenously increased sensitivity of continuation utility to updates in
beliefs as pt decreases (as evident from Figure 3).
When feeding the agent the realized consumption growth from the post-WW2 sample, the
learning problem itself is quite hard and model beliefs for most of the sample are close to 0:5.
As before, the learning mechanism that gives rise to a potential resolution of standard asset
pricing puzzles does not rely on the predictability of any moment of consumption growth in
the data.

Conclusion

This paper …nds that uncertainty about …xed parameters governing the exogenous aggregate
endowment process of the economy can have long-lasting, quantitatively signi…cant asset
pricing implications. This conclusion relies on rational learning, which implies that posterior
probabilities regarding …xed quantities are martingales, and that agents have a preference for
early resolution of uncertainty. For such agents the updating of beliefs, with its associated
permanent shocks to the conditional distribution of future consumption growth, constitute
an additional risk that can serve as a tremendous ampli…cation mechanism for the impact

of macro shocks on marginal utility.
In several cases of parameter uncertainty we document an endogenous interaction between
34

the increased precision of beliefs and an increased sensitivity of marginal utility to shocks
to beliefs. Thus, in a general equilibrium setting the asset pricing impact of parameter
uncertainty does not in general decline one for one with the variance of beliefs. For instance,
in a particular case of model uncertainty, we document that the price of risk in the economy in
fact can increase as the variance of parameter uncertainty declines due to a strong concurrent
increase in the skewness of beliefs.
We evaluate the quantitative impact of many di¤erent forms of parameter uncertainty and
show that learning about the persistence of bad states has the most dramatic asset pricing
implications. In particular, a model with a bad state calibrated to aggregate consumption
data from the U.S. during the Great Depression, where the agents learn about the persistence
of this state, yields a high equity premium (6%), a low risk-free rate (1%), with low relative
risk aversion (slightly less than 4), and low consumption volatility as in the data. In contrast,
the otherwise identical economy with known parameters yields an equity premium of 1%
with a risk-free rate of 3%. Further, this model can match the extremely high equity return
volatility observed at the onset of the Depression. We also emphasize a particular case of
model uncertainty, where agents learn whether consumption growth has a small persistent
component or not. This case, when fed the actual consumption growth realizations of U.S.
post-WW2 data, produces strongly counter-cyclical price of risk and equity risk premium at
the business cycle frequency despite the fact that both alternative models have homoskedastic
fundamentals and that preferences are isoelastic.
In sum, with Epstein-Zin preferences, which allow a separation of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and the relative risk aversion, parameter learning provides a signi…cant
source of additional macro risk that can help explain both a high level and counter-cyclical
time-variation in the volatility of the marginal utility of the representative agent, as needed
to explain asset market data.

Derivations of analytical solutions for the learning
about the mean case

There are several formal treatments of stochastic di¤erential utility and its implications for asset pricing (see, e.g.,
Du¢ e and Epstein (1992a,b), Du¢ e and Skiadas (1994), Schroder and Skiadas (1999, 2003), and Skiadas (2003)).
In this Appendix we o¤er a simple derivation of the pricing kernel that obtains in an exchange economy where the
representative agent has a KPEZ recursive utility with unit EIS and where he is learning about the constant growth
rate of aggregate consumption. We …rst recall a few well-known results about stochastic di¤erential utility.

7.1

Representation of Preferences and Pricing Kernel

We assume the existence of a standard …ltered probability space ( ; F; fFt g; P ) on which there exists a vector z(t)
of d independent Brownian motions.
Aggregate consumption in the economy is assumed to follow a continuous process, with stochastic growth rate
and volatility:

d log Ct

=

C

(Xt ) dt +

C

(Xt ) dz (t) ;

(20)

dXt

=

X

(Xt ) dt +

X

(Xt ) dz (t) ;

(21)

where Xt is a n-dimensional Markov process (we assume su¢ cient regularity on the coe¢ cient of the stochastic
di¤erential equation (SDE) for it to be well-de…ned, e.g., Du¢ e (2001) Appendix B). In particular
vector,

X

X

is an (n; 1)

is an (n; d) matrix.

Following Epstein and Zin (1989), we assume that the representative agent’s preferences over a consumption
process fCt g are represented by a utility index U (t) that satis…es the following recursive equation:
U (t) =

(1

e

dt

)Ct1

dt

+e

Et U (t + dt)

With dt = 1, this is the discrete time formulation of KPEZ, in which
coe¢ cient.
To simplify the derivation let us de…ne the function

u (x) =

6= 1

log((1

)

6= 1 ;

:

Then, de…ning the ‘normalized’ utility index J as the increasing transformation of the initial utility index J(t) =
u (U (t)), Equation 22 becomes:

g(J(t)) = (1

dt

e

)u (Ct ) + e

dt

(23)

g (Et [J(t + dt)]) :

Using the identity J(t + dt) = J(t) + dJ(t) and performing a simple Taylor expansion we obtain:

0 = u (Ct )dt

(24)

g(J(t)) + g0(J(t)) Et [dJ(t)] :

Slightly rearranging the above equation, we obtain a backward recursive stochastic di¤erential equation which
could be the basis for a formal de…nition of stochastic di¤erential utility (see Du¢ e Epstein (1992), Skiadas (2003)):
u (Ct )
g(J(t))
dt:
g0(J(t))

Et [dJ(t)] =

(25)

Indeed, let us de…ne the so-called ‘normalized’aggregator function:

We obtain the following representation for the normalized utility index:

J(t) = Et

Itô’s lemma shows that
J(t) = Et

J and a simple application of

Further, Du¢ e-Epstein (1992b) show that the pricing kernel ( (t)) for this economy has the following form (if

41

there exists an ‘interior’solution to the optimal consumption portfolio choice problem of the representative agent):

(t) = e

Rt
0

fJ (Cs ;Js )ds

(29)

fC (Ct ; Jt ) :

It is the Riesz representation of the gradient of the normalized utility index at the optimal consumption (See Chapter
10 of Du¢ e (2001) for further discussion.) We now consider the case of unitary EIS ( = 1) and give an expression
for the utility index and for the pricing kernel in this economy.

Equilibrium Prices when

Assuming the equilibrium consumption process given in equations (20)-(21) above, we obtain an explicit characterization of the utility index J and the corresponding pricing kernel

.

For this we de…ne, respectively, the operator

where hx is the (n; 1) Jacobian vector of …rst derivatives and hxx denotes the (n; n) Hessian matrix of second
derivatives. With these notations, we …nd:

This shows that our candidate solution satis…es the recursive backward stochastic di¤erential equation we are
trying to solve. Uniqueness follows from the appendix in Du¢ e, Epstein, Skiadas (1992) (under some additional
technical conditions listed therein).
The expression for the pricing kernel follows from its de…nition in equation 29, the expression for the aggregator
in equation 26 and the expression for the value function just derived.
The next result investigates the property of equilibrium prices.
Proposition 2 The risk-free interest rate is given by:

r(xt ) =

Further, if the following transversality condition is satis…ed limT

The risk premium on the claim to aggregate consumption is given by

C (x)

C (x)

Proof. To prove the result for the interest rate, apply the Itô-Doeblin formula to the pricing kernel. It follows from

Now substitute the expression for log I(x) from the ODE for I(x) in Proposition 1 to obtain the result.
To prove the result for the consumption claim, de…ne V (t) =

. It follows from Itô’s lemma that:

C (Xt )dzt

Then, using the de…nition of the risk-free rate we obtain:

dVt + Ct dt
= r(Xt ) + (
Vt

I (Xt ))

C (Xt )

C (Xt )

C (Xt )dzt

In turn since the state price density has dynamics:

an application of the Itô’s formula shows that

which is a martingale (under appropriate regularity conditions for the stochastic integral to be a Martingale). Taking
an expectation we thus obtain

If, furthermore, the solution satis…es the transversality condition listed in the proposition (i.e., limT

7.3

Application to learning

Suppose now that log consumption follows the following process:

(42)

d log Ct = dt + dz(t)

but we assume further that

has to be estimated by the representative agent based on observing past consumption.

Suppose that he starts with some Gaussian prior
Gaussian with mean and variance given by (mt ;

dmt

N (m0 ;
t)

Then it is well-known that his posterior is also

0 ).

with dynamics:

=

t

(d log Ct

=

t

d~
z (t)

(43)

mt dt)

(44)

where the second equation de…nes the innovation process z~t , a Brownian motion in the observation …ltration of the
agent, in terms of which the consumption process can be rewritten as

(45)

d log Ct = mt dt + d~
z (t) :

Further, the posterior variance is:
d

2
t

=

t

2

(46)

dt

and the regression coe¢ cient is given by:
t

=

t
:
2

(47)

Therefore, note the dynamics of :
d

t

=

2
t dt:

(48)

The solution of which is simply
1
1
=
+ t:
(t)
0
Now we see that the state-vector in the information …ltration of the agent is X (t) = [mt ; t] (or equivalently, [mt ;

7.3.1

t ]).

The pricing kernel with EIS = 1

We now derive an expression for the I ( ) function from proposition 1 above (for the case unitary EIS

= 1 and

arbitrary risk-aversion ). The ode given in equation 30 simpli…es to (we drop arguments for simplicity):

0 = I((1

Imm (t)2

+ (1

I log I + It :

(49)

We guess a solution of the form
log I(m; t) = a(t) + b(t)m
Plugging into the pde and setting coe¢ cients in m to zero we obtain two odes which are:
b0 (t)

Now for the boundary conditions we note that (since limt!1 mt =

and limt!1 (t) = 0):

It is straightforward to verify that the transversality condition of proposition 1 is satis…ed.

Now, using the expression for the pricing kernel in Proposition 1, we can obtain the interest rate in closed form

Further discussion of the "learning about the mean"economy

Here we discuss in detail the e¤ect of increasing the EIS above 1 in the case when agents are learning about the
mean growth rate in the economy discussed in Section 3. The upshot is that increasing the EIS increases return
volatility, which in turn increases the risk premium. In addition, there is an interesting interaction e¤ect between the
endogenous discount rate and the e¤ect of shocks to the mean growth rate to the wealth-consumption ratio which
makes the pricing kernel more sensitive over time to shocks to beliefs. This is di¤erent from the case where the EIS
= 1, where the sensitivity of the pricing kernel to updates in beliefs is constant, and means that the asset pricing
implications of learning decrease over time at a slower rate than the posterior variance of beliefs.

8.1

The E¤ect of the Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution

Increasing the EIS from 1 to, say, 2 has in typical calibrations only a minor e¤ect on the sensitivity of the pricing
kernel to shocks to the continuation utility. For instance, if
EIS from 1 to 2, means that this sensitivity,

= 10, as in Bansal and Yaron (2004), increasing the

1= , only increases from 9 to 9:5. However, when the substitution

e¤ect dominates the wealth e¤ect, the wealth-consumption ratio increases upon a high realization of consumption
growth as the expected mean growth rate is revised upwards. These dynamics create excess return volatility, which
in turn increases the risk premium. Further, interestingly, the endogenous sensitivity of the continuation utility to
updates in beliefs in this case increases over time, which leads to a slower decline in asset return Sharpe ratios over
time than in the cases with a lower EIS. Before we discuss these e¤ects, we …rst explain how the model is solved.

8.1.1

Model solution

In the case when EIS 6= 1, it is necessary to resort to numerical solution of the model. Further, since the wealth
and substitution e¤ects now no longer cancel, it is necessary to bound the support for the beliefs about the mean
growth rate,
and

.2 4 Therefore, we consider a truncated normal prior distribution for

, where the truncation bounds

are set such that equilibrium exists for all possible ’boundary’ (t = 1) economies, where the agents have

learned the true mean. This ensures the existence of equilibrium. The updating equations for the hyperparameters,
t+1

+ 1, remain the same. The reason for this is easiest to see by considering

Bayes’ rule when the truncation of a general, untruncated prior, p ( ), is achieved by multiplying by an indicator
function which takes the value 1 if

2

(69)

The reason is that a positive probability of an arbitrarily high (low) when the IES is greater than
(smaller than) 1, leads to a violation of a transversality condition and the equilibrium does not exist (i.e.,
the wealth-consumption ratio is in…nite). This is easiest to see by considering a deterministic economy with
a constant growth rate. If the growth rate is higher than the risk-free rate, the wealth-consumption ratio,
and thus utility, is in…nite.

48

The conjugacy of the prior comes from the functional forms of the original prior and the likelihood, p ( ) and p y t j .
Thus, if the likelihood function is normal and the prior is truncated normal, the posterior is truncated normal
with the same truncation limits as the prior. The hyperparameters,
completely describe the solution. Of course, the hyperparameter

the subjective conditional mean of consumption growth.

Note that since the posterior variance is deterministic (At+1
= At

+ 1), we can replace the state variable At

with time, t. Thus, the parameter uncertainty model is nonstationary. Building on Johnson (2007), who consider the
simpler case of power utility, we develop a solution methodology for the case of parameter uncertainty and Epstein-Zin
preferences where we solve the model using a backwards recursion from the known-parameters (t = 1) boundary

Asset pricing moments versus amount of parameter uncertainty

To assess the asset pricing implications of varying degrees of parameter uncertainty in cases where EIS 6= 1, it is
necessary to calibrate the consumption dynamics as the model relies on a numerical solution. For this exercise, we
choose the true consumption dynamics to match the mean and volatility of time-averaged annual U.S. log, per capita
consumption growth, as reported in Bansal and Yaron (2004): ET [ c] = 1:8% and

T

( c) = 2:72%. This implies

true (not time-averaged) quarterly mean and standard deviation of 0:45% and 1:65%, respectively, which are the
numbers we use in the quarterly calibration. The lower bound for the quarterly growth rate

is set at

0:3%, while

the corresponding upper bound is set at 1:2%. The prior beliefs are assumed to be unbiased and the maximum
level of prior uncertainty is A0 = 1, as before. The market claim we consider is a levered consumption claim. In
particular, we simply multiply the excess returns on the consumption claim with 1:5, which is consistent with the
average aggregate leverage ratio in the U.S. stock market.2 7
The left plot in Figure 6 shows that the conditional, annualized price of risk (that is,

t

(Mt+1 ) =Et (Mt+1 ); see

Hansen and Jagannathan (1992)) is constant at 0:33 in the known parameters benchmark economy (solid line). This
is true for any level of the EIS since consumption growth is i.i.d. In the two economies with parameter uncertainty,
however, the price of risk decreases from about 1:15 to about 0:45. Thus, as in the EIS = 1 case discussed earlier, the
25

See Vazquez-Grande (2009) for a similar solution technique.
This backwards recursion is fast and very accurate. The only additional requirement is continuity at the
boundary when going from the boundary solutions where t = 1 to a large t (we use t = 5000 as the point
in time before the known-parameter boundary is reached). This general solution method is used throughout
the paper, with detailed explanations relegated to the Appendix.
27
Note that we do not add idiosyncratic dividend growth shocks. Thus, the return volatility of the market
claim ought not be compared directly to equity market return volatility. The risk premium, however, which
is a function of the covariance of dividend and consumption growth, can reasonably be compared to the
equity market risk premium.

unbiased beliefs (i.e.,at Et [ ] = . The red dashed line gives the case when the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution (IES) is 0.5, the blue dash-dotted line gives the case when the IES is 2,

the IES does not matter for the moments shown here).
price of risk decreases with the decreasing amount of parameter uncertainty (see Equation (10)). However, whereas
the component of the price of risk due to shocks to beliefs in the EIS = 1 case decreases by a factor of 200 over the
…rst 50 years, it only decreases by a little less than a factor of 3 in the cases shown in Figure 6.2 8
This much slower decline in the price of risk at the beginning of the sample is mainly due to the e¤ect of truncation
bounds, which alters the prior distribution. In particular, for high At the prior is close to a uniform distribution with
upper and lower bounds

and

. Thus, extreme values are ruled out, which decreases the price of risk, but at the

same time, learning is slower as the signal to noise ratio in this case is decreased, relative to the untruncated case.
After about 100 quarters the e¤ect of the truncation is negligible as, for

t

=

, the truncation bounds are 5

standard deviations away given the tighter prior at this time. At this point, there is an interesting relation between
the price of risk and the level of the EIS. In particular, the price of risk decreases more slowly with time with a higher
EIS (the red, dashed line has EIS = 0.5, while the blue, dashed-dotted line has EIS = 2). This is the result of an
endogenous interaction between the amount of parameter uncertainty, the e¤ect of such uncertainty on the volatility
of the pricing kernel, and the level of the EIS.
The rightmost plot of Figure 6 shows the sensitivity of the continuation utility component of the log pricing
28

In the plot, the price of risk decreases from about 1:15 to about 0:6 over the …rst 200 quarters. Since the

(see Equation (4)). From the analytical EIS

= 1; 495 and is thus constant. From the rightmost

plot of Figure 6, focusing on the dynamics after 100 quarters of learning has taken place and the e¤ects of truncation
are negligible, it is clear that this sensitivity is increasing for the high EIS case, but decreasing for the low EIS case.
In fact, this time-varying sensitivity is due to an endogenous interaction between discount rates and the size of the
shock to the growth rate,

t.

As is well understood, the price-consumption ratio is more sensitive to shocks to the

growth rate if discount rates are low (see, e.g., Pastor and Veronesi (2002)). When the EIS is greater than one and
the substitution e¤ect dominates, the price-consumption ratio increases when uncertainty decreases (see also Bansal
and Yaron (2004)) and so, holding

t

= , the price-consumption ratio in this case increases over time, meaning that

discount rates decrease and, thus, the sensitivity to belief shocks increases. When the EIS is less than one, however,
the price-consumption ratio is decreasing over time as discount rates now increase when uncertainty decreases, and
this makes the pricing kernel less sensitive to shocks to beliefs over time. These endogenous dynamics are why after
100 years of learning the component of the price of risk that is due to belief shocks is almost twice as big for EIS =
2 versus EIS = 0.5, even though the direct risk price of shocks to the continuation utility (

1= ) when the EIS =

2 is only 1.19 times the same when the EIS = 0.5.
Figure 7 shows the conditional, annualized market risk premium, log return volatility, as well as the log real yield
spread, for di¤erent economies versus the amount of parameter uncertainty, as measured by quarters passed since the
initial prior, A0 = 1. The conditional moments are always calculated assuming an unbiased prior,

t

= .2 9 . The

yield spread is de…ned as the di¤erence between the annualized 10-year yield on a real, default-free zero-coupon bond
minus the current (quarterly), annualized real risk-free rate. The economies with parameter uncertainty have EIS

= 0:994. As a benchmark, the black solid line depicts the case where

is known (in which the EIS does not matter for any of the reported moments, given the assumed i.i.d. consumption
growth process).
For the high EIS case (

= 2), the risk premium is initially about 12%, declining as posterior variance decreases,

and after 100 years of learning about 3%. For comparison, the case where

is known yields a risk premium of 1:7%

(for any level of the EIS). Thus, there is again a signi…cant e¤ect of parameter uncertainty even after 100 years of
learning, even though at this point the standard deviation of beliefs about
For the low EIS case (

= 0:5), however, the risk premium is initially negative and increasing as posterior

variance decreases. When the EIS is less than one, the wealth e¤ect dominates, and therefore a positive revision in
beliefs about , resulting from high realized consumption growth, is accompanied by a decrease in the price-dividend
ratio of this claim. For high levels of parameter uncertainty, the return on this claim is in fact negatively correlated
with realized consumption growth, which leads to a negative risk premium. As the posterior variance tightens over
time, the updates in the price-dividend ratio become smaller and the realized dividend dominates, which restores the
positive correlation between the return to this claim and consumption growth.

(IES) is 0.5, the blue dash-dotted line gives the case when the IES is 2, while the black solid line

for the moments shown here).

52

The middle plot in Figure 7 shows how these dynamics play out for the volatility of returns. With a high
EIS, when the substitution e¤ect dominates, a positive shock leads to both high dividends and an increase in the
price-dividend ratio of the claim, which in turn means return volatility is high (excess volatility). After 100 years
of learning, the volatility is 6:2% versus 5% in the benchmark, known parameters economy. With a low EIS, the
response of the price-dividend ratio and realized dividend growth o¤set to some extent and volatility is therefore
always lower than in the case with an EIS > 1. The lowest level of volatility occurs when the level of parameter
uncertainty is such that the two o¤set almost exactly, as seen at around 180 quarters of learning.
The bottom plot in Figure 7 shows that the yield spread is positive initially and then basically zero for the case
of high EIS, but negative initially for the case of a low EIS. With a low EIS, the volatility of the risk-free rate is
higher, which leads to more volatile bond returns. The negative risk premium on real bonds, which are hedges in
this economy as discussed earlier, is therefore higher in the case if a low EIS, which leads to a negative yield spread.
With a high EIS, however, the e¤ect of expected future higher short-term rates, as precautionary savings decreases
over time, dominates initially.
In sum, with an EIS greater than one, the model delivers excess return volatility and a higher risk premium
than in the case when EIS = 1, as analyzed earlier. Further, the real term structure is, except for in cases with
very high parameter uncertainty, essentially ‡at. Again, this is in sharp contrast to the objective long-run risks
assumed in Bansal and Yaron (2004), which implies a strongly downward-sloping yield curve. A low EIS generates a
counter-factual negative risk premium and also tends to deliver return volatility that’s lower than dividend volatility,
which is strongly counter-factual (see, e.g., Shiller (1980), Campbell and Shiller (1987)).

8.2

Unknown variance

In the preceding, the variance parameter

2

was assumed known to investors. It is straightforward to relax this

assumption, though as pointed out in Weitzmann (2007) and Bakshi and Skouliakis (2010), it is necessary to truncate
also the support for

2

in order to ensure …nite utility. Weitzmann (2007) argues that learning about the variance

parameter can lead to arbitrarily high risk premiums as the subjective distribution for consumption growth becomes
fat-tailed. He further argues that learning about the mean, as in the preceding section, does not increase the fatness
of the tails of the conditional consumption growth distribution and therefore cannot help in explaining asset pricing
puzzles. Clearly, the latter intuition does not hold when considering a utility function that allows for a preference for
early resolution of uncertainty.3 0
Bakshi and Skouliakis (2010) argue that Weitzmann’s results, which are developed under power utility, are not
robust to reasonable truncation limits for

2

. However, given that we focus primarily not on the fatness of the tails,

but on permanent shocks to the conditional consumption growth distribution induced by the learning process itself,
uncertain variance can potentially still have important asset pricing implications. In the following, we show that
30
In fact, with a truncated normal as the prior, the tails of the subjective distribution are actually less fat
than for a normal distribution with the same dispersion, but due to the updating that generates long-run
risks, the asset pricing implications were shown to be nontrivial.

53

quantitatively large asset pricing implications of learning about the variance parameter indeed can arise, but that
interesting asset pricing e¤ects of learning about the variance parameter are shorter-lived than those documented for
the uncertain mean case.

First, consider the dashed line, which shows the case when learning about the variance only. The volatility of the

(2010), the fatness of the tails given reasonable bounds on the variance parameter is not su¢ cient to strongly a¤ect
asset prices. However, the large updates in beliefs about the variance that occur in the …rst 10 years does have
signi…cant impact on the volatility of the pricing kernel through the e¤ect on the continuation utility. After this,
the impact of shocks to beliefs about the variance parameter have a very small impact. The dash-dotted line shows
the case of unknown mean and variance. Here, we see that adding unknown variance yields a pricing kernel that
is on average always more volatile than in the known variance, unknown mean case. However, there are only large
di¤erences in the …rst decade, relative to the case with only unknown mean (dotted line).
The risk premium for a 100 year long sample that start with priors corresponding to tossing out the 10 …rst years
plotted in Figure 8, is 1:8% for the case of unknown variance but known mean, relative to 1:7% for the benchmark
known parameters economy. In the case of unknown mean and variance, the average risk premium over this sample

In sum, unknown variance has more of a second-order e¤ect on asset pricing moments, unless uncertainty is very
large, as would be the case in the decade after a structural break for instance. There are two reasons for this more
short-lived e¤ect. First, Bayesian learning implies that learning about variance is much faster than learning about
the mean. Second, the variance is a second order moment, so generally less important for the continuation utility
than changes in the mean.

rule to learn about whether there is a disaster or not, as well as the mean growth rate in the disaster state.
This mean growth rate is drawn at the beginning of each disaster and so it is not a …xed parameter as in
the case we consider here.

in the Depression state, , on a grid for a and B .
To ensure existence of equilibrium, it is necessary to truncate the distribution for the unknown parameters. For
example, the normal distribution for the mean in the disaster state implies that there is a positive probability that
the disaster state has, in fact, an arbitrarily high mean growth rate. As is well known, the growth rate of the economy
has, in conjunction with preference parameters, to satisfy a transversality condition, so an unbounded support for

2

is inadmissible. Further, as pointed out by Geweke (2002), Weitzman (2007), and Bakshi and Skoulakis (2010), it is
also necessary to truncate the support for

2

. The updating equations for the state variables are not a¤ected by the

truncation, although of course the numerical integration will take the truncation into account. More details on the
model solution technique are provided later in this Appendix.
As discussed earlier, our focus in this paper is on unbiased priors and we choose wide truncation limits relative
to the initial prior to limit the e¤ects of truncation on our results.3 3 In particular, we let the truncation limits
on the mean growth rate be +=

4 standard deviations away from the true mean, where the standard deviation

Simulating data from the truncated Inverse-Gamma distribution, we …nd

that this implies that the prior standard deviation of beliefs about the variance

pricing implications of assuming that only the mean or only the variance are unknown. This is achieved by setting
A0 = 0 and b0 = 1, respectively.
Panel A of Table 5 shows the case where only the disaster mean

2

is unknown. When

= 3:9 the average

sample equity premium is 1:80% versus 1:05% in the known parameters benchmark case. This compares to 5:67% for
the case of unknown transition probabilities. Thus, while an uncertain disaster mean adds risk to this calibration, the
risk ampli…cation is much less than in the case of unknown persistence parameters. The Sharpe ratio is 0:19, while
the risk-free rate is somewhat high at 2:75%, again giving a much poorer …t to the data than the case of unknown
transition probabilities.
Figure 9 shows as an example a simulated path of the annual wealth-consumption from this economy, which

At the same time, we do not choose truncation limits that are very close to violating transversality
conditions. Bakshi and Skoulakis (2010) show that the results in Weitzman (2007) are due exactly to this,
i.e. that the quantitatively signi…cant results come from the tiny probability of extreme levels of consumption
volatility.

Through simulation we verify that the truncation bounds are such that E 22 jb0 ; B0 = b0B0 1 is very

shows how updates in beliefs only happen in the Depression state. In this case, the updating leads to time-varying
beliefs about

2

(see Equation (82)), which is re‡ected in time-variation in the wealth-consumption ratio.3 5 Thus,

the learning about the mean economy generates somewhat more interesting dynamics in valuation ratios during a
disaster than the case when learning about the transition probabilities.

Figure 9: The …gure shows a representative simulated 100-year sample path from the 2-state regime
switching model, where the mean consumption growth rate in the bad state is unknown. Top plot
shows the mean belief about this parameter, while the lower plot shows the annualized wealthconsumption ratio (P=C), given a 100-year training period for the prior.
In Barro, Nakamura, Steinsson, and Ursua (2011), the standard error about the annual disaster mean is reported
to be 0:7%, which corresponds to about 0:18% for a quarterly mean. This level of uncertainty corresponds roughly
to a 200-year prior learning period before the last 100-years of data these authors base their estimates on. In the
200-year prior case, the equity premium is 1:45% and the Sharpe ratio is 0:17, while for the 300-year prior the risk
premium is 1:33% and the Sharpe ratio is 0:16. Thus, while the e¤ects of parameter uncertainty are decreasing over
time, the decrease is very slow simply because one can only learn about a parameter that governs dynamics in a rare
event when the event occurs.
35

We did not feed actual regimes and consumption shocks into this model as quarterly consumption data
is not available for the pre-WW2 period (including, of course, the Great Depression).

58

The rightmost set of columns shows the case when the risk aversion coe¢ cient is increased from 3:9 to 5. Now,
the 100-year prior yields a risk premium of 4:95% for the case of unknown mean with a 100-year prior, decreasing to
3:57% for the 300-year prior, which is still substantially higher than the 2:74% in the known mean benchmark case.
Note that the modest increase in risk aversion in this experiment has a large impact on the asset pricing moments.
This is nonlinearity is due to the negative skewness and ensuing non-normality of the consumption dynamics the
Depression calibration implies (see, e.g., Rietz (1988)). To summarize Panel A of Table 5, unknown Depression mean
can almost double the risk premium and increase the Sharpe ratio by up to a factor of 1.5 relative to the known
parameter case. This is in contrast to the previous case with unknown transition probabilities which increased the
risk premium by up to a factor of 5 and the Sharpe ratio by almost a factor of 3.
Figure 9 shows a 100-year path of the mean belief about the Depression mean, at , as well as the wealthconsumption ratio, when the model is fed regimes from the last century of U.S. macro data, as discussed earlier for
the case of unknown transition probabilities. The calibration has

= 3:9 and a 100-year prior and uncertainty over

only the mean parameter. The wealth-consumption ratio falls at the onset of the Great Depression, as before, but now
the updating about the mean growth rate in the Depression state leads to more dynamics in the wealth-consumption
ratio while in the Depression state. Once the normal state re-emerges, the wealth-consumption ratio is constant as
there is nothing to learn outside of the Depression event for the uncertain parameters considered here.
Panel B of Table 5 shows the case where only the variance in the bad state is unknown. This case is quickly
summarized. For either risk aversion assumptions, the asset pricing implications arising from the 100-, 200-, and
300-year priors are in all cases the same as those for the known parameters benchmark model. As is well-known,
second moments are much more precisely estimated than …rst moments, and this is re‡ected in the speed of learning
about the variance parameter. Note that this result is robust to small changes in the truncation bounds for

2
2.

Panel C of Table 5 shows the case where both the mean variance in the bad state are unknown. In this case, the
risk premium and Sharpe ratio are slightly higher than for the case where only the mean was unknown. For instance,
for

= 3:9, the risk premium increases from 1:80% to 1:83%, while for the

= 5 case, the risk premium increases

from 4:95% to 5:13%. Thus, the unknown variance does interact with the unknown mean, in particular to create a
little higher return volatility, but the e¤ect is not very large. In sum, in the case considered here where the priors
are unbiased, uncertainty about a truncated volatility parameter does not have large asset pricing impact given a
reasonably calibrated prior. Of course, with biased priors, a drifting variance parameter can a¤ect both ex ante and
ex post risk premiums considerably (see Johannes, Lochstoer, and Mou (2010)). The exercise in this paper, however,
is to establish the properties of the risk pricing of parameter uncertainty.

conditional level of long-run risk given the Bansal-Yaron model, and the probability that the Bansal-Yaron model is

the true model, relative to the iid consumption growth model, pt .
The boundary cases, pt = 0 and pt = 1, are solved as follows. For iid consumption growth, the price-consumption
ratio, P Ct , is found using the fact that this ratio is constant in this case. Thus:

where the parameters are de…ned in the main text. The price-consumption ratio is found on a grid for x
^ by iterating
on Equation (86) given an initial guess of P C (pt = 1; x

Given these boundary solutions, the price-consumption ratio for the general cases where 0 < pt < 1 are found by

grid as p approaches zero in order to ensure a nicely behaved PC ratio at this boundary. We use 200 grid points for
p with a strongly nonlinear grid for the reason just mentioned. The exact grid used can be obtained upon request.

but does not know the transition probabilities

At t = 0, the agent is given an initial, Beta-distributed prior over each of these parameters and

thereafter updates beliefs sequentially upon observing the time-series of realized regimes, st . We denote the history
of realized regimes up until time t as st . The prior Beta-distribution coupled with the realization of regimes, which
are governed by constant probabilities, leads to a conjugate prior and so posterior beliefs are also Beta-distributed.
The probability density function of the Beta-distribution is:
(1

B (a; b)

a 1

p ( ja; b) =

(95)

where B (a; b) is the Beta function (a normalization constant). The parameters a and b govern the shape of the
distribution. Of particular interest is the expected value:

E [ ja; b] =

a
:
a+b

(96)

In our case, there is one uncertain probability corresponding to each regime and a standard application of Bayes
rule shows that the updating equations basically count the number of times state i has been followed by state i
versus the number of times state i has been followed by state j. Given this sequential updating, we let the a and b
parameters have a subscript for the relevant state (1 or 2), as well as a time subscript .In particular:

ai;t

=

ai;0 + # (state i has been followed by state i) ;

(97)

bi;t

=

bi;0 + # (state i has been followed by state j) :

When solving this problem numerically, we use the known parameters boundary economies (at T = 1 when the

parameters have been learned) as terminal values in a backwards recursion, following Johnson (2007).3 6 We use the

true long-run (unconditional) growth, which is a function of the uncertainty about the transition probabilities, is the
same for the dividend claim as for the consumption claim. Note that the long-run mean under the agent’s …ltration
is in fact random and its’ t + 1 value can be expressed as

(st+1 ; st ; Xt ). Finally, dividends have an idiosyncratic

component given by the standard normal shock "d , which is assumed uncorrelated with any other shocks in the
economy.
Solving for the price-dividend ratio of this claim is analogous to solving for the consumption claim. Note how
the uncertainty about the in…nite horizon dividend growth rate is the same as that for in…nite horizon consumption
growth rate as the exposure of dividend growth to

Limiting economies –boundary values for general case

All parameters known

The simplest limiting economy is given by the case where both

11

and

22

(108)

are known. Since the state is observed and

all the parameters are known, st is the only state variable and thus the wealth-consumption ratio can only take on
two values. Solving this limiting economy amounts to solving two nonlinear equations in two unknowns (P C (s = 1)
and P C (s = 2)):

These equations are relatively straightforward to solve numerically, imposing the requirement ex ante that the wealthconsumption ratio is positive and real. In our case, it was possible to verify that there is only one economically
reasonable solution by plotting the function space for the grid for the

0

s, given the other parameters as assumed in

the main paper.
We solve these limiting equations for a grid on

11

and

22

with lower and upper bounds set to the 0:01% and

99:9% percentile values of the initial prior distribution for the general case we ultimately want to solve for, as given
by ai;0 and bi;0 , i 2 f1; 2g.

One transition probability known, one unknown

the other is unknown. This case corresponds to

< 1,

64

22;1

or

11;1 ,

22;t

< 1. We can …nd the wealth-

From these boundary values, we iterate backwards in time (which here is a 2-dimensional concept, as we are
recording time spent in each regime) to …nd the solution for the …nite ’s we ultimately are interested in.

11.3

Existence of equilibrium

The existence proof relies on the concavity of the value function and the fact that the value function is …nite in
all the boundary, known parameter cases. In particular, the value function is bounded above by either, depending
on whether the value of the EIS is above or below 1, the case where there is only the good state (
22

= 0, and economy starts in good state), or the case where there is only the bad state (

11

= 0 and

11
22

= 1 and
= 1 and

economy starts in bad state). Thus, the existence condition amounts to checking existence for cases of i.i.d. normal
log consumption growth with known mean and variance. A similar approach can be used to prove existence for all
the cases considered in this paper.

from consumption growth in the good state.

Given that log consumption growth is normally distributed, these prior beliefs lead to posterior beliefs that are of
the same form (conjugate priors). The updating equations for investors’beliefs are:

In terms of pricing, note that this system can be reduced to three state-variables: a , B , and , given initial priors.
We solve the model numerically and, as before, use the closed-form solution for the known parameters cases as the
boundary values in a recursion that is solved backwards in time, where time again is counted in terms of time spent in
the Depression state, , on a grid for a and B .Both distributions have to be truncated in order to ensure existence
of equilibrium.
De…ne the state vector Xt = [a ; B ] as the state-variables in the economy with the exception of time in state 2,
, and the state itself, st . The equilibrium recursion used to solve the model is then:

P C (st ; X jst = 2)

=

Pr (st+1 = 2jst = 2; Xts )
h
:::E e(1 ) ct+1 (P C (st+1 ; st ; X

+1 )

Pr (st+1 = 1jst = 2; Xts )
h
i
:::E e(1 ) ct+1 (P C (st+1 ; st ; X ) + 1) jst+1 = 1; st = 2; Xt :
:::

P C (st ; X jst = 1)

=

i
+ 1) jst+1 = 2; st = 2; Xt +

1; Xts )

Pr (st+1 = 2jst =
h
:::E e(1 ) ct+1 (P C (st+1 ; st ; X

+1 )

i
+ 1) jst+1 = 2; st = 1; Xt +

Pr (st+1 = 1jst = 1; Xts )
h
i
:::E e(1 ) ct+1 (P C (st+1 ; st ; X ) + 1) jst+1 = 1; st = 1; Xt :
:::

Note that P C (s; X ) appears in both sides of each equation as there is no updating of beliefs if the economy is in
state 1 next period. Thus, the numerical recursion involves also solving the nonlinear 2 equations, 2 unknowns problem

implicit in these equations. We numerically integrate over the uncertainty in the mean and volatility parameters,
as well as for the shock to consumption . In particular, we use quadrature weights for the truncated normal for
as well as for the inverse gamma for

price-dividend ratio for the claim to the exogenous dividend stream is found analogously given the solution for the
price-consumption ratio (as in the earlier cases).

Table 5: This table gives average sample moments from 20,000 simulations of 400 quarters of data from the 2-state switching
regime model of consumption growth, where the mean and/or variance parameters 2 and 22 are unknown. The bad state
is calibrated to correspond to the U.S. consumption data over the Great Depression, as explained in the main text. ET [x]
denotes the average sample mean of x, SRT [x] denotes the average sample Sharpe ratio of x, and T [x] denotes the average
sample standard deviation of x. Rm and Rf denote the gross market return and real risk-free rate. Lower case letters denote
log of upper case variable. All statistics are annualized and, except for the Sharpe ratio, given in percent. In all cases, the
time-preference parameter is set to 0.994. The relative risk aversion and intertemporal elasticity of substitution are given for
each panel. The ’data’column shows the historical excess market return moments for the U.S. from 1929 to 2011, as given in
CRSP. The real risk-free rate moments are taken from a similar sample as reported in Bansal and Yaron (2004).
