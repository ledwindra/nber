Introduction1

In Prucha and Nadiri (1982) we Introduced a methodology to estimate
systems of dynamic factor demand that allows for considerable flexibility in
both the choice of the functional form of the technology and the expectation

formation process. This approach was explored further in Prucha and Nadiri
(1986). It Is based on a firm with a finite but shifting planning horizon.
The stocks at the end of the planning horizon are determined endogenously via
the assumption that the firm maintains a constant firm size and static

expectations beyond the actual planning horizon. Prucha and Nadiri (1982)
introduced also a corresponding estimation algorithm that avoids the need for

an explicit analytic solution of the firm's control problem and show how at
the same time it is possible to evaluate (for reasons of numerical efficiency)
the gradient of the statistical objective function from analytic expressions.
A generalization of the algorithm is given in Prucha and Nadiri (1988).

In this paper we apply the methodology of Prucha and Nadiri (1982) to
estimate the production structure and the demand for labor, materials, capital
and R&D in the historic U.S. Bell System.

(The merits of the breakup f the

U.S. Bell System is still an Item of considerable debate. In future research
it seems of interest to compare the historic U.S. Bell System with several of
the currently operating telephone companies. )

We consider alternative

specifications of the length of the planning horizon and the expectation
formation process; we compare, in particular, results obtained from the finite

horizon model with those from an infinite horizon model. The empirical
application to the U.S. Bell System not only provides an illustration of the
methodology but also contributes several new features to the existing

literature on the production structure of AT&T. First, we formulate and

1

estimate a dynamic model in contrast to the static models that were usually
applied to AT&T data.2 Schankerman and Nadiri (1986) find evidence to reject

the hypothesis that for AT&T all factors are variable. Second, contrary to
conventional studies we include R&D as a factor of production. R&D should be
of particular importance in a high technology firm like AT&T.3
As a description of the technology we introduce a new restricted cost
function that generalizes the restricted cost function introduced by Denny,

Fuss and Waverman (1981a) and Morrison and Berndt (1981) from the linear

homogeneous to the homothetic case. Furthermore, we discuss measures of
technical change if the firm is in temporary rather than long—run equilibrium
and if the technology is not a priori assumed to be linear homogeneous.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we describe the
theoretical model under both the assumption of a finite and infinite planning
horizon, and derive the factor demand equations used in the empirical

analysis. In Section 3 we present the parameter estimates of the model
corresponding to different planning horizons and expectation regimes.
Adjustment cost characteristics as well as price and output elasticities of
the inputs in the short—, intermediate— and long—run are presented in Section

4. Section 5 deals with the formulation of pure measures of technical change
and the measurement of returns to scale. In Section 6 we provide a
decomposition of the traditional measure of total factor productivity growth
into components attributable to technical change, scale and the adjustment

costs. We also provide a decomposition of the growth of output and labor
productivity. Section 7 deals with the calculation of rates of return on
physical and R&D capital. The conclusions are contained In Section 8 followed
by a brief technical appendix.

Theoretical Model and Empirical Specification

2.1 Theoretical Model
Consider a firm that employs in variable inputs V

quasi-fixed inputs X (j1

(i1,...,m) and n

n) in producing the single output good Y.

The firm's production process Is described by the following generalized
production function:

Y = F(V ,X ,X ,T

is twice continuously differentiable and that

It is assumed that F(.)

> 0 and Fii <

It is furthermore assumed that the production function Is Strictly

concave in all arguments (except possibly in the index of technology). This

implies that the marginal products of the factors of production V and X1
are decreasing and that the marginal adjustment costs are Increasing.
The stocks of the quasi—fixed factors accumulate according to (j=1,. ..

The firm Is asstimed to face perfectly competitive markets with respect to

its factor inputs. We denote the acquisition price for the variable and

quasi—fixed factors as w

(1=1

m) and

(j=l,...,n), respectively.

It proves convenient to normalize all prices in terms of the price of the

3

=

first variable factor. We denote those normalized prices as w
and

q =

q1/w

and define vectors w =

{W}m2 and q =

Instead of describing the production structure in terms of the production
function (1) we can describe the productions structure equivalently in terms

of the normalized restricted cost function. Let {V} denote the cost
minimizing variable factor inputs needed to produce output V

where A denotes taxes (which will be specified In detail later on) and

is a vector composed of w,

T, as well as tax parameters.

The firm is assumed to minimize the present value of current and future

costs. We consider two alternative specifications of the firm's optimization
problem regarding the length of the planning horizon. First consider the case
of an infinite planning horizon.

In this case the firm's objective function

in period t Is assumed to be given by

(5)

C(X

,Eu
)(l+r)t
t. t+t

where E denotes the expectatIons operator conditional on information

available at the beginning of period t and r denotes the real discount

rate.

It Is assumed that in each period t

the firm derives an optimal plan

for the quasi—fixed inputs for periods t.t+1,... such that (5) Is minimized
subject to the initial stocks X1 and information available at that time;
the firm then chooses its quasi—fixed inputs In period t according to this
plan.

(Note that in each period the firm only Implements the initial portion

of its optimal input plan.) The firm repeats this process every period. In
each period a new optimal plan is formulated as new information on the
exogenous variables becomes available and expectations on those variables are
modified accordingly.
Next consider the case of a finite but shifting planning horizon.

Following Prucha and Nadiri (1982, 1986) we assume that the stocks of the
quasi—fixed Inputs at the end of the planning horizon are determined
endogenously subject to the assumption of static expectations and a constant

firm size beyond the planning horizon. This means that under the finite

horizon specification the firm minimizes (5) in each period t subject to the
constraints

2.2 EmpIrical Specification
For the empirical analysis we specialize the model to the use of two
variable inputs, labor (L) and materials (H), and two quasi—fixed factors, the

where H(Y) is a function in V.

(The scale elasticity is then given by

H(Y)/EY(dH/dY)]; compare also Section 5.) We note that h(Y) can (apart from
a scaling factor) be viewed as a second order translog approximation of H(Y).

The restricted cost function (7) can hence be viewed as a

second order approximation to that of a general homothetic production

function. The functional form (7) Is a generalization of the restricted cost
function introduced by Denny, Fuss and Waverman (1981a) and Morrison and
Berndt (1991) from the constant returns to scale case to the homothetic case.

In case of constant returns to scale we have p =

We will explore the model under alternative assumptions on the planning

horizon and expectations on output. Expectations on relative prices and tax
parameters are taken as static. In case of an infinite planning horizon the
firm's objective is defined as to minimize (5) subject to (7) and (8). We

The demand equations for the variable factors, labor and materials, are the

same as in the infinite horizon case. The estimating equations for the finite
horizon model are hence given by (ii), (12) and (14), with random errors added

to each of those equations. The next period plan values KT 1 and RT 1
appearing in (14) are unobservable but implicitly defined by (13).

In

principle we could solve (13) to obtain explicit analytic expressions for
T

K

and RT

,

and substitute those expressions into (14). However,

because of the complexity of the expressions involved this approach is quite
impractical even for short planning-horizons. We hence estimate the model
using the algorithm developed in Prucha and Nadiri (1982, 1988) for the full
information maximum likelihood estimator for systems of equations with

implicitly defined variables.8 This algorithm does not require an explicit

analytic solution for K1 and R but solves (13) numerically for those
values at each iteration step of the estimation algorithm, i.e. for each set

of trial parameter values. For numerical efficiency Prucha and Nadiri (1982,
1988) show how the algorithm can be designed such that the gradient of the

10

log-likelihood function can be evaluated from analytic expressions rather than
by numerical differentiation.
We note that under static output expectations the 'flnite horizon"

quasi—fixed factor demand equations (14) differ from the 'Infinite horizon"
quasi—fixed factor demand equations (10) only in the expression for the next

period plan values. In the infinite horizon case we have K

Estimation and Empirical Results

We have estimated the production structure and factor demand for the Bell

System using data from 1951 to 1979. Data on 1967 constant dollar gross
output, capital, R&D, labor, and materials, as well as data on the rental
prices of capital and R&D, the wage rate, and material prices,

were taken from

sources provided by AT&T. The sources and construction of the data are
described in Nadiri and Schankerrnan (1981b). We used a simple time trend as
our technology index and a real discount rate of 4 percent.9 Data on output,
stocks of capital and R&D, labor and materials were used in mean scaled form;
prices were constructed conformably.

For the finite horizon model we considered several different forms of
expectations, but because of need for brevity only the results

obtained for

two expectations processes are reported. First, in order to identify the true
effect of changing the planning horizon we consider (as in the infinite
horizon case) static expectations:

= '1

'j

for t = o,. . ,T.
.

the second form of expectations we first estimate an AR model for

To generate
output1° and

then use the model to generate a sequence of rational expectations.

We have tested several hypotheses (in addition to the hypothesis that the
adjustment paths of the two quasi fixed factors are separable, which was, as

reported above, accepted). We first considered the hypothesis that the

technology Is homogeneous, i.e., p—O, and accepted this hypothesis.11 The
second hypothesis considered the absence of adjustment costs for both of the
quasi—fixed factors, i.e.

a.. =

a..

= 0.

This hypothesis was clearly

rejected; similarly the hypotheses of the absence of adjustment costs was

rejected individually for K and R. This suggests that a static equilibrium
model is inappropriate to describe the technology and the structure of factor

12

demand of the Bell System. A similar conclusion was reached by Schankerman
and Nadiri (1986) using a different methodology.
In Table 1 we present the estimation results for the infinite horizon
model with static expectations and of the 4-period and 10—period horizon

models with static and rational (output) expectations. We allowed for
autocorrelation of the disturbances in all equations. The estimation
technique used was full information maximum likelihood. The results reported
in Table 1 show good R2's for all four equations and models. The
DW—statistics generally do not suggest further autocorrelation. A comparison
of the likelihoods corresponding to static and rational expectations on output
suggests (somewhat informally) the rejection of the hypothesis of static
expectations in favor of rational expectations.

The parameter estimates for the infinite and the 4—period horizon model

under static expectations are very similar. The largest change occurs in the
estimate for a.. which is about 90 percent higher for the 4-period horizon

model. The estimate of a.. changes only by 5 percent. We hypothesize from
this result that by expanding the planning horizon a bit more we should be

able to duplicate (in a numerical sense) the results of the infinite horizon
model under static expectations almost exactly with our finite horizon model.

This is borne out by the results reported in Table 1 for the 10—period

planning horizon. The results for the 10—period and infinite horizon model
under static expectations are essentially identical.12
By allowing for nonstatic expectations we get further differences in our
parameter estimates, especially for a v, aR

is 200 percent larger than that from the 4—period horizon model with static

expectations. We note, however, that the results for the 4-period and
10—period horizon model under rational expectations are again very similar.

The above results suggest that the optimal plans for the finite horizon
model converge rapidly to those of the infinite horizon model as the planning
horizon increases.

(Similar evidence was reported by Prucha and Nadirl (1986)

for a somewhat different model under rational price and output expectations.

We note that this result may be viewed as a justification for why it may be
reasonable for a firm to only plan moderately ahead into the future (which is

what firms actually do). Additional planning costs will very quickly exceed
additional gains from extending the planning horizon. To put it differently,
the length of the planning horizon does matter for the investment decision of

the firm. However once a reasonable horizon is identified, the finite horizon
model approximates the infinite horizon model very well.
In principle, we can estimate all of the technology parameters from the
variable factor demand equations, i.e. the labor and material demand equation,

alone. Those equations are essentially unaffected by the choice of the
planning horizon and the form of the expectations. By estimating the labor
and material equations jointly with the demand equations for capital and R&D

we hope to increase the precision of our estimates. We can, however, only
expect Improvements If the demand equations for the quasi-fixed factors and In
particular the expectations entering those equations are properly specified.
In light of this remark we would not expect that different forms of

expectations and different choices for the length of the planning horizon

affect all estimates of model parameters equally. Not surprisingly we find

16

the main changes in estimates for parameters that determine the adjustment
path of capital and R&D (while the estimates of other parameters that
determine characteristics of the technology such as scale are essentially
unaffected).

Adlustment Costs, Price and Output Elasticities

4.1. Adlustment Process
For the infinite horizon model the optimal paths for the quasi-fixed
factors capital and R&D are described by the flexible accelerator equations
(10).

In each period a fraction of the difference between the initial stocks

of capital and R&D and the respective long—run optimal values are closed.
(Note that the long—run optimal values, i.e. the targets, are changing over

time in response to changes in the variables exogenous to the firm's input

These fractions correspond to the adjustment coefficients m

decisions. )

and mRR.

For the finite horizon model the optimal input path has no exact

accelerator representation. Still, since the expressions for the adjustment
coefficients in (lOc) only depend on the technology parameters and the

discount rate, we can pose the question of what values for in KX

implied

and mRE

are

by the estimates of the technology parameters obtained from the finite

horizon models.

Table 2 contains estimates of implied adjustment coefficients for capital

and R&D, m

and m, for the infinite horizon model under static

expectations and the four-period horizon model under static and rational

expectations. The estimates of the adjustment coefficients for capital are

quite different from those for R&D. The estimates for mKK vary between 0.94

and 0.83 and those for m

between 0.24 and 0.21. The estimates for m

and

mRB obtained under the assumption of rational expectations are about 10

To give some indication of the disequilibrium (from a long—run

model with static expectations the percentage difference of actual values from

long—run optimal values for respective inputs. These deviations are given In
Table 3.

defined by (10); the long—run optimal values for labor and material, L

are
and

are obtained by substituting K: and R

into (11).

At the beginning of the sample period labor and materials exceeded
considerably the long—run optimal values; the reverse is true for capital and

R&D. Over time there have been changes in the extent to which actual and long
—run optimal values differ. For the variable inputs, labor and materials, as
well as for capital the (absolute) difference between actual and long—run
optimal values declined substantially in the 1950's. The gap between the
actual stock of R&D and the long-run optimal value widened in the late 1950's,
then declined throughout the 1960's.

It widened again slightly in the 1970's;

still, the size of the shortfall in the actual stock of R&D from the long—run
optimal value in 1979 is about 65'!. higher than in 1951.

4.2. Elasticities
Tables 4 and 5 contain, respectively, price and output elasticities

of

the demand for capital, R&D, labor and materials. Elasticities calculated
from estimates obtained from the 4-period, 10—period and infinite horizon
model under static expectations were found to be quite similar.

Likewise

elasticities calculated from estimates obtained from the 4—period and
10—period horizon model under rational expectations were found

to be similar.

In Tables 4 and 5 we hence only report elasticities corresponding to estimates
of the 4—period horizon model with static and rational output expectations,

respectively.13 Short—run, intermediate— and long—run elasticities are,

respectively, evaluated at t+t with t=O, r1 and r.
The own—price elasticities for both capital and R&D are small. The
long—run own—price elasticity for capital varies between —0.25 and —0.28,

for R&D between -0.12 and —0.14. The cross—price elasticities of R&D are

20

With c

we denote, respectively, the elasticities of the factor Z

capital (K), R&D (R), materials (H), labor (L) with respect to output (Y).
The symbols SR, JR and LR refer to the short-run, intermediate-run and
long-run.

The respective estimates for the short—run output elasticity of capital are

0.60 and 0.54, those of R&D are 0.14 and 0.15. The estimates of the short-run
output elasticity of materials and labor show that both factors overshoot in

the short—run. The respective estimates of the short—run output elasticity of

22

materials are 1.53 and 1.56, those of labor are 1.38 and 1.29.

The differences in the short—run output elasticities corresponding to
estimates obtained under the assumptions of static and rational output

expectations are sizable. Consider a change in output by, say, 7 percent.
(The average growth rate of output for AT&T over the sample period was 7.33

percent.) Then the implied differences In the estimated short-run demand for
the stock of capital, the stock of R&D, materials and labor would be

approximately -0.4, -0.1, -0.2, and 0.6 percent. The average ratios of net
capital and R&D investment to the stocks of capital and R&D over the sample

period were 5.9 percent and 6.3 percent respectively. Therefore the above
reported differences in the demand for stocks of capital and R&D translate

themselves Into big differences in Investment demand. The labor bill and the
materials bill of AT&T in 1967 were, respectively, 4329 and 1508 millions of

dollars. The above reported differences in the demand for labor and materials
hence imply significant dollar differences in how we expect variable costs to
react to changes in output.

TechnIcal Change and Scale
To avoid ambiguities we explicitly define measures for technical change

and scale within the context of our cost of adjustment technology,

I.e. within

the context of temporary equilibrium. In the following we use again the

general notation of Section 2 with V =

[V,V1

= [L,M1

and X =

[X,X]

=

EK,R].
Let a(,V,X1,X,T) be the factor by which output can be increased for
given inputs if the technology index shifts by ,

F(V,X,K,T+).

i.e.

aF(V,X1,X,T) =

Similarly let b(,V,X,AX,T) be the factor by which all

inputs can be decreased for a given level of output If the technology index

i.e.

shifts by ,

F(V,X1,X,T) =

F(bV,bX,bX,T+).

We then define the

following "output and input based" measures of technical change:

We note that the definitions adopted here are analogous

to those given in Caves, Christensen and Swanson (1981) and Caves, Christensen
and Diewert (1982a,b) for technologies without adjustment costs.

The Lemma in the Appendix implies Immediately the following relationships

8F/aX = _EaG/8AX]/[3G/aY].

F/8T = —I8G/aTI/EaG/3YI.

Consequently A and A, and hence c, can be written as follows in terms
of the restricted cost function G(.):

Given our estimate for the restricted cost function G we can now
estimate technical change and scale from the above expressions.
for technical change and scale are quite stable over models.

Our estimates
(As remarked

above, this suggests that differences in the specification of expectations and
the length of the planning horizon mainly affect the estimates of the dynamic
characteristics of the model and not the estimates of basic technological

characteristics.) The estimates were also quite stable over time. In the
following we report results for the 4—period horizon model with rational

expectations. The estimate of scale,

c,

for 1967 is 1.60, suggesting that

AT&T has experienced substantial economies of scale. This estimate is
somewhat lower than that reported in Nadiri and Schankerman
the range of estimates reported in Christensen, Cummings

are 0.60 and 0.37

Canada.

The expressions in (17) for output based and input based technical change
and scale In terms of the restricted cost function were given previously in

Nadiri and Prucha (1983, 1984). They generalize analogous expressions given
Caves, Christensen and Swanson (1981) for a model without explicit adjustment
costs and by Otha (1975) for a model where all factors are variable.

(We note

that the algebra employed here Is completely analogous to that used by Caves,
Christensen and Swanson. )

variable

All results generalize trivially to the case of in

and n quasi—fixed factors. Furthermore, the results can be readily

generalized along the lines of Caves, Christensen and Swanson to the multiple
output case.

15

The issue of a proper measure of technical change, given the firm is in
short-run or temporary equilibrium but not in long—run equilibrium, has also
been discussed, In particular, in recent papers by Rerndt and Fuss (1981,

1986), Hulten (1986), and Morrison (1983, 1986). Those papers relate the
proper measure of technical change to an adjustment of traditional measures in
terms of a capacity utilization measure.

Berndt, Fuss and Hulten consider

technologies with constant returns to scale. Morrison allows for (possibly)
non—constant returns to scale and works within an explicit dynamic framework.

Given our analysis also allows for (possibly) non—constant returns to scale
and Is based on an explicit dynamic framework it seems of interest to relate
our measures of technical change to those given by Morrison (and hence to that

in the papers by Berndt, Fuss and Hulten). Define total cost and shadow cost
as

(18)

where c and z = -aG/ax

change defined in terms of the total cost function:

Morrison's

(1983,1986) measures of pure technical change (denoted in her paper

by c;.1 and e'1) correspond exactly to the expressions on the right hand
side of (19a) and (19b), and hence are identical to those considered here.
Based on the expressions on the right hand side of (19a) and (19b) and the

observation

that C /C can be viewed as a measure of capacity utilization

Morrison emphasizes that the derivation of a pure measures of technical change

from c

involves an adjustment in terms of capacity utilization to account

for temporary equilibrium. The approach taken here, and previously by Nadirl
and Prucha (1983, 1984), is to first look for a proper definition of technical
change on the production side and then to demonstrate how this measure can be

evaluated in terms of the restricted cost function. The two approaches
complement each other in terms of interpretation.

Decomposition of Total Factor Productivity and Output Growth
Traditional measures of productivity growth assume, in particular, (1)

that all factors are variable, (2) that the technology exhibits constant
returns to scale, (3) that output and Input markets are perfectly competitive,

and (4) that factors are utilized at a constant rate. If any one of those
assumptions is not satisfied, traditional measures of total factor

productivity growth will not be pure measures of technical change.16 Given
traditional measures of total factor productivity growth are widely used, it
seems of interest to analyze the Composition of those measures if those
assumptions are possbily not satisfied.

(The question how to properly

estimate technical change under non—constant returns to scale and within a

dynamic

framework was

discussed in Section 5.

Denny, Fuss and Waverman (1981b) and Nadiri and Schankerman (1981a,b)
consider technologies with non—constant returns to scale and provide, within a
static framework, a decomposition of the traditional measure of total factor
productivity growth into a part attributable to technical change and a part

attributable to economies of scale. A similar decomposition exists for our

cost of adjustment technology. More specifically, let IF? be the rate of
growth of total factor productivity as measured by the conventional Divisia

index and let ATFP be the corresponding Tornquist approximation defined as

Based on (21) we have decomposed TFP for different types of model
specifications and different periods. We present in Table 6 the results for
the four-period horizon model with rational expectations. The results for the

other models were similar to those reported in this table. They indicate that
the scale effect is by far the most important contributor to total factor

productivity growth. The temporary equilibrium effect and the adjustment cost
effect are negligible and technical change contributes about 10 to 12 percent

to growth of total factor productivity. The contributions of scale and
technical change are comparable to those reported by Denny, Fuss and Waverman

(1981b) for Bell Canada. Average total factor productivity growth for the
Bell System was about 2.82 percent in 1952—1965; it declined slightly (2.71
percent) in 1965—1972, but increased substantially in 1972-1979 to 3.87

percent. This pattern is in sharp contrast to the behavior of total factor
productivity growth at the level of the total economy and many of the
industries (Nadiri (1981)) for the period 1972 to 1979.

The contributions of inputs, technical change and adjustment costs to

growth of output are shown In Table 7. This decomposition is based on the

restricted cost function obtained for the four-period horizon model with

rational expectations using the formulae given in (16). Decompositions based
on estimates from other models were again very similar to those reported in
Table 7.

The average growth rate of output of the Bell System has been very

high, about 7.33 percent per annum over the entire sample period. The
contributions of various inputs to the growth of output differ considerably.
The most significant source of the growth of output is the growth of capital

which contributes more than 50 percent to the growth of output. Materials and
labor Inputs contribute about 14 percent while the contribution of technical

change Is about half as much. Growth of R&D contributes about 2 percent
which, given its small share In the production cost, is fairly substantial.
The same pattern of contributions are evident over the time periods of

1952—1965, 1965—1972 and 1972—1979. The results suggest that most of the
growth of output is accounted for by the growth of the conventional inputs in
the Bell system.

The major component of labor productivity growth is again due to the growth of
capital and to a much lesser extent due to technical change, materials and

scale. Growth in R&D also contributed less than 1 percent to the growth of
labor productivity; the adjustment costs played a relatively small role in
reducing labor productivity.

Averag Rate of Return on Physical and R&D Capital

7.

In the following we define a measure for the rate of return on the
investment expenditures on an individual factor in period t within the present

framework of a dynamic factor demand model; cp. also Mohnen, Nadiri and Prucha

(1986). In this paper we have assumed that the firm chooses its
inputs such that it minimizes, for a given output stream, the discounted value

of its costs. For expository reasons, consider for a moment a firm
whose objective is to maximize the discounted value of its net revenue stream:

(24)

where

°

fl(Vt,T ,Xt*T—i ,tXt+t )/(1+r)'

simplicity, prices in the argument list of H.) Let {Xt•t ,V

plan. The firm's net investment expenditures on (say) the first quasi-fixed

factor are then given by X =

1(X1—X11).

returns from this investment we have to compare these returns with the returns

from an input sequence where that particular investment is not undertaken. To
capture the pure effect of the firm's investment we assume that this
alternative input sequence is conditionally optimal, i.e., optimal subject to
the condition that the firm's investment in the first quasi—fixed factor in

period t is not undertaken and hence zero. More formally, we consider as the

alternative input sequence, say {t+T

The definition generalizes in an obvious way to the case of a finite
planning horizon. Further, in case of a cost—minimizing firm we can think of
establishing the respective input sequences by optimizIng (24) subject to the

output constraint. Formally, we can then still use (25) for the calculation
of the average rate of return on investment. However, since gross revenues
are identical for both input sequences we then effectively compare the
difference in cost streams.

In Table 9 we present the estimated internal rates of return on net
investment in plant and equipment and R&D for the period 1952-1979 and for
three subperiods for both finite and infinite planning horizons and for both

static and rational expectations on output. These rates are net of the
adjustment costs and depreciation of the two quasi—fixed Inputs. They are
calculated using equation (25). The gross rate of return will be of course

much higher. The gross rate of return on capital will average about 13
percent and that on R&D about 30 percent. The magnitude and pattern of these
rates are quite comparable to what has been reported in the literature.18

Several interesting points about these results should be noted: First,
the net average rates of return for capital and R&D are quite different; the
rate of return on R&D Is about two to five times larger than that on capital.

This result is consistent with the results reported in the literature

which show that the rate of return on R&D is much higher than that on physical

capital. Second, there are variations in the rates of return over time for
both capital and R&D. The return on physical capital is fairly stable from
1951 to 1972 at about 7 to 8 percent and then declines to an average rate of

return of 4 to 5 percent. The average rate of return on R&D is not only
higher than that on physical capital but seems to rise over time and therefore
the gap between the two rates widens substantially.

Conclusions
In Prucha and Nadirl (1982, 1986, 1988) we developed a methodology that

allows for the estimation of systems of dynamic

factor

demand without strong a

priori restrictions on the functional form of the technology and the

expectation formation process. In this paper we applied this methodology to
estimate the production structure and dynamic factor demand of AT&T. We
considered alternative assumptions concerning the planning horizon and the

form of expectations. The technology was modeled by a new restricted cost
function. This function generalizes the restricted cost function introduced
by Denny, Fuss and Waverman (1981a) and Morrison and Berndt (1981) from the
linear homogeneous to the homothetic case. The paper computes various short-,
intermediate- and long—run price and output elasticities.

Furthermore, we

present proper measures of technical change for technologies where some of the
factors are quasi—fixed and shows how those measures can be evaluated in terms

of the restricted cost function. Those measures were first introduced In
Nadiri and Prucha (1983, 1984) and are related here to measures introduced by

Morrison (1983, 1986). The paper also provides a decomposition of (the
traditional measure of) total factor productivity growth Into technical change
and components that are attributable to scale and the adjustment costs.
Our empirical results suggest the following:

(1) The optimal plans for the finite horizon model converge rapidly to
those of the infinite horizon model as the planning horizon extends.

(The

obtained estimation results for the 10—period and the Infinite horizon model

are found to be nearly identical; Prucha and Nadiri (1986) report similar
results.) This observation suggests that additional planning costs will

quickly exceed additional gains from extending the planning horizon. This

37

observation may hence serve as a rational for why many firms only plan
moderately into the future.

(2) Not all parameter estimates are equally sensitive to alternative

specifications of the expectation formation process. On the one hand
estimates of parameters determining the adjustment path of capital and R&D

turned out to be sensitive. This, of course, would in turn affect conclusions
concerning the effects of tax and monetary policies on investment. On the
other hand estimates of other characteristics of the underlying technology
such as scale seem to be insensitive to the specification of the expectation
formation process.

(3) Using our model we calculate the rates of return on physical and
R&D capital. The net rate of return on R&D is about two to five times larger
than that on capital. Also the gap between the two rates widens over the

sample period. The average net rate of return on R&D Investment over the
period 1952 to 1979 is approximately 20 percent.

(4) The model generates reasonable estimates of the price and output
elasticities for the variable and quasi—fixed inputs in the short—,

intermediate— and long—run. We find evidence that the variable inputs
overshoot in the short-run their long—run targets and that in particular the
estimates of the short—run elasticities are sensitive to the specification of
the expectation formation process.

(5) The obtained estimates for output and input based technical change
are approximately 0.60 and 0.37, those for the returns to scale are
approximately 1.60.

(6) The estimates of the adjustment coefficients suggest a fairly short
adjustment period for physical capital and a long adjustment period of about

38

four to five years for R&D. Our estimates of the adjustment coefficients are
sensitive to the form of expectations, but Insensitive to the length of the
planning horizon (unless it is chosen very short).

(7) Our decomposition of the traditional measure of total factor
productivity growth shows that approximately 80 percent of the growth is due
to scale effects and only approximately 10 percent is due to pure technical

change. That is, the traditional measure of total factor productivity growth
would seriously mi3measure technical change in the U.S. Bell System.

A first revision was circulated as Nadiri and Prucha (1984).

(This revision

was submitted as a contribution to a book that remained In the stage of
preparation. )

The present revision connects the material with recent

developments in the theory of dynamic factor demand and productivity

measurement. We would like to thank Pierre Mohnen for his assistance. We
also gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science
Foundation, Grant PRA-8108635. and the Research Board of the Graduate School

of the University of Maryland. Furthermore we thank the computer centers of
New York University and the University of Maryland for their support with

Christensen, Cummings and Schoech (1983) and Nadiri and Schankerman

(1981b) specify a restricted variable cost function and demand equations for
the variable factors, but do not estimate dynamic demand equations for the

quasi—fixed factors. Similar models have been estimated using Bell Canada
data; see Denny, Fuss and Waverman (l981b).

Nadiri and Schankerman (1981b) do treat R&D as a factor of production and

Christensen, Cummings and Schoech (1983) use R&D as a proxy for an index of
technology.

We take the production function to be twice differential in all

arguments. Let f be some function and let z be some argument of f. Then
denotes the partial derivative of f with respect to z.

As an alternative to (5) we could have stated the firm's objective

function in period t as

EYm
C(Xt+T,X
,ff
t*T
t..t—1
t—t=o

(5')

It

is well known that in case CC.) is linear—quadratic the (certainty

equivalence feedback control) solution for X, corresponding to (5) is
identical to that implied by the (closed loop feedback control solution)

corresponding to (5'). This result is typically referred to as the certainty
equivalence principle. If CC.) Is not linear—quadratic certainty equivalence
will generally not hold. Malinvaud (1969) derives, however, for this latter
case a first—order certainty equivalence result under reasonable conditions.

We note that the formulation in (5) may be interpreted as a limited
information formulation in that it only depends on knowledge of the first

moment of the exogenous variables (i

} , while

t.t r=o

the formulation in (5'

depends (in general) on the knowledge of their entire distribution. For an
interesting limited information formulation based on the knowledge of the

first and second moments see Bitros and Kelejian (1976).

We have tested the hypothesis that a.. =

=0

both from the infinite

horizon model and from the finite horizon model via the likelihood ratio test.

To estimate the model in the infinite horizon case under the alternative we
followed the approach developed in Epstein and Yatchew (1985) and Madan and
Prucha (1988).

In estimating the finite horizon model we followed the

approach developed in Prucha and Nadiri (1982, 1988).

Note that

reduces to (l+r) in the case of static output

expectations.

We note that the algorithm can be readily modified to apply to

alternative objective functions.

46

We have estimated the model with alternative discount rates and found the
results quite insensitive to this specification.

The autoregressive model for output was of the form (t—ratios are given

in parentheses)

The value of the likelihood ratio test statistic was 1.86 compared to the
critical value of 3.84.

12

To examine the effect of the length of the planning period we estimated

the finite horizon model with planning horizons of two, four, five and ten

periods. Whatever changes can be observed seem to follow patterns that are
smooth with respect to the length of the planning horizon. To conserve space,
we report in Table 1 only the estimates for the four and ten period planning
horizon.

13

The elasticities are both a function of the model parameters and

expectations. The elasticities reported for the two sets of parameter

estimates are in both cases evaluated under static expectations. Therefore
any difference in the elasticities are solely due to differences in the
parameter estimates.

In applying the Lemma we take y=Y, m=V,

f(.)=F(.)

k=[X ,1X,T],

The Lemma is only given for completeness.
