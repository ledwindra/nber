Understanding the Great Recession

ABSTRACT
We argue that the vast bulk of movements in aggregate real economic activity during the Great Recession
were due to financial frictions interacting with the zero lower bound. We reach this conclusion looking
through the lens of a New Keynesian model in which firms face moderate degrees of price rigidities
and no nominal rigidities in the wage setting process. Our model does a good job of accounting for
the joint behavior of labor and goods markets, as well as inflation, during the Great Recession. According
to the model the observed fall in total factor productivity and the rise in the cost of working capital
played critical roles in accounting for the small size of the drop in inflation that occurred during the
Great Recession.

1. Introduction
The Great Recession has been marked by extraordinary contractions in output, investment
and consumption. Mirroring these developments, per capita employment and the labor force
participation rate have dropped substantially and show little sign of improving. The unemployment rate has declined from its Great Recession peak. But, this decline primarily reáects
a sharp drop in the labor force participation rate, not an improvement in the labor market.
Indeed, while vacancies have risen to their pre-recession levels, this rise has not translated into
an improvement in employment. Despite all this economic weakness, the decline in ináation
has been relatively modest.
We seek to understand the key forces driving the US economy in the Great Recession.
To do so, we require a model that provides an empirically plausible account of key macroeconomic aggregates, including labor market outcomes like employment, vacancies, the labor
force participation rate and the unemployment rate. To this end, we extend the mediumsized dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model in Christiano, Eichenbaum and
Trabandt (2013) (CET) to endogenize the labor force participation rate. To establish the
empirical credibility of our model, we estimate its parameters using pre-2008 data. We argue
that the model does reasonably well at accounting for the dynamics of twelve key macroeconomic variables over this period.
We show that four shocks can account for the key features of the Great Recession. Two
of these shocks capture ñ in a reduced form way ñ frictions which are widely viewed as having
played an important role in the Great Recession. The Örst shock is motivated by the sharp
increase in credit spreads observed in the post-2008 period. To capture this phenomenon, we
introduce a perturbation into householdsí Örst order condition for optimal capital accumulation. We refer to this perturbation as the Önancial wedge. One interpretation of this wedge
is that it reáects variations in bankruptcy costs and other costs of Önancial intermediation.1
An alternative interpretation is that the wedge reáects a change in the desirability of bonds
issued by non-Önancial Örms to Önance their acquisition of capital. This change could arise
due to variations in the risk or liquidity premium associated with non-Önancial Örms. Motivated by models like e.g. Bigio (2013), we allow the Önancial wedge to impact on the cost of
working capital.
The second shock is motivated by the notion that in the crisis there was a áight to safe
and/or liquid assets. For convenience, we capture this idea as in Smets and Wouters (2007)
and Fisher (2014), by introducing a perturbation to agentsí intertemporal Euler equation governing the accumulation of the risk-free asset. We refer to this perturbation as the consumption wedge. An alternative interpretation of this shock comes from the literature stressing a

reduction in consumption as a trigger for a zero lower bound (ZLB) episode (see Eggertsson
and Woodford (2003), Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2012)).
The third shock in our analysis is a neutral technology shock that captures the observed
decline, relative to trend, in total factor productivity (TFP). The Önal shock in our analysis corresponds to the changes in government consumption that occurred during the Great
Recession.
Our main Öndings can be summarized as follows. First, our model can account, quantitatively, for the key features of the Great Recession, including the ongoing decline in the labor
force participation rate. According to our model, if the labor force participation rate had not
fallen, then the decline in employment, consumption and output that occurred during the
Great Recession would have been substantially smaller. Second, our model implies that the
vast bulk of the decline in economic activity is due to the Önancial wedge and, to a smaller
extent, the consumption wedge.2 Third, the rise in government consumption associated with
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 did have a peak multiplier e§ect of
about 1:6. But, the rise in government spending was too small to have a substantial e§ect on
aggregate economic activity. In addition, for reasons discussed in the main text, we cannot
attribute the long duration of the Great Recession to the substantial decline in government
consumption that began around the start of 2011. The peak multiplier associated with the
decline in government spending is roughly equal to 0:9. Fourth, consistent with the basic
Öndings in CET, we are able to account for the general behavior of real wages during the
Great Recession, even though we do not allow for sticky wages. Fifth, our model can account
for the relatively small decline in ináation with only a moderate amount of price stickiness.
Our last Önding is perhaps surprising in light of arguments by Hall (2011) and others that
New Keynesian (NK) models imply ináation should have been much lower than it was during
the Great Recession.3 Del Negro et al. (2014) argue that Hallís conclusions do not hold if
the Phillips curve is su¢ciently áat.4 In contrast, our model accounts for the behavior of
ináation after 2008 by incorporating two key features of the data into our analysis: (i) the
prolonged slowdown in TFP growth during the Great Recession and (ii) the rise in the cost of
Örmsí working capital as measured by the spread between the corporate-borrowing rate and
the risk-free interest rate. In our model, these forces drive up Örmsí marginal costs, exerting
countervailing pressures on the deáationary forces operative during the post 2008 period.
Our paper may be of independent interest from a methodological perspective for three
2
The Öndings with respect to the Önancial wedge are consistent with Del Negro, Giannoni and Schorfheide
(2014), who reach their conclusion using a di§erent methodology than the one that we use.
3
In a related criticism Dupor and Li (2013) argue that the behavior of actual and expected ináation during
the period of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is inconsistent with the predictions of NK style
models.
4
Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011) reach a similar conclusion based on data up to the end of
2010.

reasons. First, our analysis of the Great Recession requires that we do stochastic simulations
of a model that is highly non-linear in several respects: (i) we work with the actual nonlinear
equilibrium conditions; (ii) we confront the fact that the ZLB on the nominal interest rate is
binding in parts of the sample and not in others; and (iii) our characterization of monetary
policy allows for forward guidance, a policy rule that is characterized by regime switches in
response to the values taken on by endogenous variables. The one approximation that we use
in our solution method is certainty equivalence. Second, as we explain below, our analysis of
the Great Recession requires that we adopt an unobserved components representation for the
growth rate of neutral technology. This leads to a series of challenges in solving the model and
deriving its implications for the data. Third, we note that traditional analyses of vacancies
and unemployment based on the Beveridge curve would infer that there was a deterioration
in the e¢ciency of labor markets during the Great Recession. We argue that this conclusion
is based on a technical assumption which is highly misleading when applied to data from the
Great Recession.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section describes our
model. The following two sections describe the data, methodology and results for estimating
our model on pre-2008 data. In the next two sections, we use our model to study the Great
Recession. We close with a brief conclusion. Many technical details of our analysis are
relegated to a separate technical appendix that is available on request.

2. The Model
In this section, we describe a medium-sized DSGE model whose structure is, with one important exception, the same as the one in CET. The exception is that we modify the framework
to endogenize the labor force participation rate. We suppose that an individual can be in
one of three states: out of the labor force, unemployed or employed in the market. In our
model, the household faces the following tradeo§. It can keep people at home producing a
non-market produced consumption good. Alternatively, it can send people to the market to
seek employment. The wages earned in the labor market can be used to acquire a marketproduced consumption good or an investment good. When wages are low and/or the job
Önding rate is low, then households choose a lower labor force participation rate.
2.1. Households and Labor Force Dynamics
The economy is populated by a large number of identical households. Each household has
a unit measure of members. Members of the household can be engaged in three types of
activities: (i) (1 % Lt ) members specialize in home production in which case we say they are
not in the labor force and that they are in the non-participation state; (ii) lt members of the
4

household are in the labor force and are employed in the production of a market good, and
(iii) (Lt % lt ) members of the household are unemployed, i.e. they are in the labor force but
do not have a job.
We now describe aggregate áows in the labor market. We derive an expression for the
total number of people searching for a job at the end of a period. This allows us to deÖne
the job Önding rate, ft ; and the rate, et ; at which workers transit from non-participation into
labor force participation.
At the end of each period a fraction 1 % ' of randomly selected employed workers is
separated from the Örm with which they had been matched. Thus, at the end of period t % 1
a total of (1 % ') lt!1 workers separate from Örms and 'lt!1 workers remain attached to their
Örm. Let ut!1 denote the unemployment rate at time t%1; so that the number of unemployed
workers at time t % 1 is ut!1 Lt!1 . The sum of separated and unemployed workers is given by:
(1 % ')lt!1 + ut!1 Lt!1 = (1 % ') lt!1 +

Lt!1 % lt!1
Lt!1
Lt!1

= Lt!1 % 'lt!1 :
We assume that a separated worker and an unemployed worker have an equal probability, 1%s;
of exiting the labor force. It follows that s times the number of separated and unemployed
workers, s (Lt!1 % 'lt!1 ) ; remain in the labor force and search for work. We refer to s as the
ëstaying rateí.
The household chooses rt ; the number of workers that it transfers from non-participation
into the labor force. Thus, the labor force in period t is:
Lt = s (Lt!1 % 'lt!1 ) + 'lt!1 + rt :
The total number of workers searching for a job at the start of t is s (Lt!1 % 'lt!1 ) + rt which,
according to the previous expression, can be expressed as follows:
s (Lt!1 % 'lt!1 ) + rt = Lt % 'lt!1 :

(2.1)

By its choice of rt the household in e§ect chooses Lt : We require rt & 0; so that the restriction
on the householdís choice of Lt is
1 & Lt & s (Lt!1 % 'lt!1 ) + 'lt!1 :

(2.2)

It is of interest to calculate the probability, et ; that a non-participating worker is selected
to be in the labor force. We assume that the (1 % s) (Lt!1 % 'lt!1 ) workers who separate
exogenously into the non-participation state do not return home in time to be included in the
pool of workers relevant to the householdís choice of rt : As a result, the universe of workers
5

from which the household selects rt is 1 % Lt!1 : It follows that et is given by:5
et =

rt
Lt % s (Lt!1 % 'lt!1 ) % 'lt!1
=
;
1 % Lt!1
1 % Lt!1

(2.3)

which is non-negative by (2.2).
The law of motion for employment is:
lt = (' + xt ) lt!1 = 'lt!1 + xt lt!1 ;

(2.4)

where xt denotes the hiring rate.
The job Önding rate is the ratio of the number of new hires divided by the number of
people searching for work, given by (2.1):
ft =

xt lt!1
:
Lt % 'lt!1

(2.5)

2.2. Household Maximization
Members of the household derive utility from a market consumption good and a good produced at home.6 The home good is produced using the labor of individuals that are not in
the labor force, 1 % Lt :
L
CtH = . H
t (1 % Lt ) % F(Lt ; Lt!1 ; . t ):

(2.6)

The term F(Lt ; Lt!1 ; . Lt ) captures the idea that it is costly to change the number of people
in the labor force, Lt . We include the adjustment costs in Lt so that the model can account
for the gradual and hump-shaped response of the labor force to a monetary policy shock (see
L
subsection 4.3). . H
t and . t are a processes, discussed below, that ensure balanced growth.
5
We include the staying rate, s; in our analysis for a substantive as well as a technical reason. The substantive reason is that, in the data, workers move in both directions between unemployment, non-participation
and employment. The gross áows are much bigger than the net áows. Setting s < 1 helps the model account
for these patterns. The technical reason for allowing s < 1 can be seen by setting s = 1 in (2.3). In that case,
if the household wishes to make Lt % Lt%1 < 0, it must set et < 0: That would require withdrawing from the
labor force some workers who were unemployed in t % 1 and stayed in the labor force as well as some workers
who were separated from their Örm and stayed in the labor force. But, if some of these workers are withdrawn
from the labor force then their actual staying rate would be lower than the Öxed number, s: So, the actual
staying rate would be a non-linear function of Lt % Lt%1 with the staying rate below s for Lt % Lt%1 < 0 and
equal to s for Lt % Lt%1 & 0: This kink point is a non-linearity that would be hard to avoid because it occurs
precisely at the modelís steady state. Even with s < 1 there is a kink point, but it is far from steady state
and so it can be ignored when we solve the model.
6
Erceg and Levin (2013) also exploit this type of tradeo§ in their model of labor force participation.
However, their households Önd themselves in a very di§erent labor market than ours do. In our analysis
the labor market is a version of the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, while in their analysis, the labor
market is a competitive spot market.

6

An employed worker gives his wage to his household. An unemployed worker receives
government-provided unemployment compensation which it gives to its household. Unemployment beneÖts are Önanced by lump-sum taxes paid by households. The details of how
workers Önd employment and receive wages are explained below. All household members
have the same concave preferences over consumption, so each is allocated the same level of
consumption.
The period utility function of the representative household is:
"
!
Mt+1
~
;
(2.7)
Ut = ln Ct + v
Pt
where Mt+1 denotes beginning-of-period t + 1 money holdings and v is an increasing and
concave function. To accommodate the scenario in which the market rate of interest is zero,
we require that v 0 (m) = 0 for some Önite m & 0: Our analysis does not require any other
restrictions on v: In equation (2.7),
%$
%$ & !1
#
$
$
H
; 0 < 6 < 1:
C~t = (1 % !) Ct % bC/t!1 + ! CtH % bC/t!1

(2.8)

Here, Ct denotes purchases of the market consumption good. The parameter b controls the
degree of habit formation in household preferences. We assume 0 ) b < 1: A bar over a
variable indicates its economy-wide average value.
According to (2.7) the household does not su§er disutility from the activities of people in
the three states of the labor market. Given the ordinal nature of utility in our setting, this
assumption can be thought of simply as a normalization. We think that work in the labor
market does generate disutility. But, so does work in the home and the experience of being
unemployed. The omission of labor disutility from (2.7) corresponds to the assumption that
this disutility is (i) additively separable from the utility of consumption and (ii) the same in
the three labor market states. Given complete consumption insurance, (i) and (ii) imply that
the only e§ect of moving from one labor market state on household utility operates through
its impact on the budget constraint. Formally, we could subtract a term, 7 t > 0; in (2.7)
that is invariant to the distribution of workers across states. We do not include such a term
because it has no impact on equilibrium allocations and prices.
We see no obvious reason to think that the disutility from working in the home and the
market sector are di§erent. It is also not obvious to us that the disutility from the activities
of being unemployed and from being employed are very di§erent. On the one hand, time
use surveys suggest that the unemployed have more leisure (see, e.g., Aguiar, Hurst and
Karabarbounis (2012)). On the other hand, Hornstein, Krusell and Violante (2011) argue
that the value of unemployment is quite low. In addition, there is a number of studies that
report that unemployed people experience adverse physical and mental health consequences
7

(see, e.g., Brenner (1979), Schimmack, Schupp, and Wagner (2008), Sullivan and von Wachter
(2009)). In addition, our assumption about 7 t improves the business cycle performance of
the model. See CET for an extended discussion.7
The áow budget constraint of the household is as follows:
Pt Ct + PI;t It + At+1

(RK;t uK

Here,
At+1 &

Bt+1
+ Mt+1
Rt

(2.10)

denotes the householdís end of period t Önancial assets. According to (2.10), Önancial assets
are composed of interest-bearing discount bonds, Bt+1 =Rt ; and cash, Mt+1 : In principle there
are three types of bonds that households can purchase: government bonds, bonds that are
used to Önance working capital and bonds that can be used to purchase physical capital.
In our benchmark model these three bonds are perfect substitutes from the perspective of
the household. The variable, Tt ; denotes lump-sum taxes net of transfers and Örm proÖts
and RK;t denotes the nominal rental rate of capital services. The variable, uK
t ; denotes the
utilization rate of capital. We assume that the household sells capital services in a perfectly
competitive market, so that RK;t uK
t Kt represents the householdís earnings from supplying
capital services. The increasing convex function a(uK
t ) denotes the cost, in units of investment
K
goods, of setting the utilization rate to ut : The variable, PI;t ; denotes the nominal price of
an investment good and It denotes household purchases of investment goods. In addition,
the nominal wage rate earned by an employed worker is denoted by Wt and . D
t Dt denotes
exogenous unemployment beneÖts received by unemployed workers from the government. The
term . D
t is a process that ensures balanced growth and will be discussed below.
When the household chooses Lt it takes the aggregate job Önding rate, ft ; and the law of
motion linking Lt and lt as given:
lt = 'lt!1 + ft (Lt % 'lt!1 ) :

(2.11)

Relation (2.11) is consistent with the actual law of motion of employment because of the
deÖnition of ft (see (2.5)).
The household owns the stock of capital which evolves according to,
Kt+1 = (1 % B K ) Kt + [1 % S (It =It!1 )] It :
7

(2.12)

Our assumption that ( t is the same across all labor market states implies that the analysis of ChodorowReich and Karabarbounis (2014) does not apply to our environment.

8

The function S(+) is an increasing and convex function capturing adjustment costs in investment. We assume that S(+) and its Örst derivative are both zero along a steady state growth
path.
The sources of uncertainty in this economy are a monetary policy shock and two technology shocks. We now deÖne the household problem which is broken into two stages. The Örst
and second stages occur before and after the period t monetary policy shock is realized. In
the Örst stage the household decides its quantity variables and the total size of its Önancial
portfolio. In the second stage it chooses the composition of that portfolio between cash and
interest bearing bonds.
Let the vector, st ; denote current and lagged values of the two technology shocks. Let
the vector, Xt ; denote the householdís own state variables at the start of time t :
$

H

Xt - Kt ; Lt!1 ; It!1 ; C/t!1 ; C/t!1

The corresponding aggregate quantities are denoted by Xta : The aggregate variables,
a

t ; ft ; PI;t ; Pt ; Wt ; Tt ; which enter the household budget constraint, are functions of Xt and
st . The variable, Rt ; is a function of Xta ; st and also the monetary policy shock, "R;t .

2.3. Final Good Producers
A Önal homogeneous market good, Yt ; is produced by competitive and identical Örms using
the following technology:

(Yj;t ) dj ;
(2.13)
Yt =

9

where J > 1: The representative Örm chooses specialized inputs, Yj;t ; to maximize proÖts:
Z 1
P t Yt %
Pj;t Yj;t dj;
0

subject to the production function (2.13). The Örmís Örst order condition for the j th input
is:
" %
!
Pt %!1
Yt :
(2.14)
Yj;t =
Pj;t

Finally, we note that the homogeneous output, Yt can be used to produce either consumption
goods or investment goods. The production of the latter uses a linear technology in which
one unit of Yt is transformed into 5t units of It :
2.4. Retailers
As in Ravenna and Walsh (2008), the j th input good is produced by a monopolist retailer,
with production function:
1
(zt hj;t )1!1 % . 2t N:
(2.15)
Yj;t = kj;t

The retailer is a monopolist in the product market and is competitive in the factor markets.
Here kj;t denotes the total amount of capital services purchased by Örm j. Also, . 2t N represents
an exogenous Öxed cost of production, where N is a positive scalar and . 2t is a process,
discussed below, that ensures balanced growth. We calibrate the Öxed cost so that retailer
proÖts are zero along the balanced growth path. In (2.15), zt is a technology shock whose
properties are discussed below. Finally, hj;t is the quantity of an intermediate good purchased
by the j th retailer. This good is purchased in competitive markets at the price Pth from a
wholesaler. As in CEE, we assume that to produce in period t; the retailer must borrow a
share { of Pth hj;t at the interest rate, Rt ; that he expects to prevail in the current period: In
this way, the marginal cost of a unit of hj;t is
Pth [{Rt + (1 % {)] ;

(2.16)

where { is the fraction of the intermediate input that must be Önanced. The retailer repays
the loan at the end of period t after receiving sales revenues. The j th retailer sets its price, Pj;t ;
subject to the demand curve, (2.14), and the Calvo sticky price friction (2.17). In particular,
)
Pj;t!1 with probability O
Pj;t =
:
(2.17)
with probability 1 % O
P~t
Here, P~t denotes the price set by the fraction 1 % O of producers who can re-optimize. We
assume these producers make their price decision before observing the current period realization of the monetary policy shock, but after the other time t shocks. Note that, unlike CEE,
10

we do not allow the non-optimizing Örms to index their prices to some measure of ináation.
In this way, the model is consistent with the observation that many prices remain unchanged
for extended periods of time (see Eichenbaum, Jaimovich and Rebelo, 2011, and Klenow and
Malin, 2011).
2.5. Wholesalers and the Labor Market
A perfectly competitive representative wholesaler Örm produces the intermediate good using
labor only. Let lt!1 denote employment of the wholesaler at the end of period t % 1: Consistent with our discussion above, a fraction 1 % ' of workers separates exogenously from the
wholesaler at the end of period. A total of 'lt!1 workers are attached to the wholesaler at
the start of period t: To meet a worker at the beginning the period, the wholesaler must pay
a Öxed cost, . 3t P, and post a suitable number of vacancies. Here, P is a positive scalar and
. 3t is a process, discussed below, that ensures balanced growth. To hire xt lt!1 workers, the
wholesaler must post xt lt!1 =Qt vacancies where Qt denotes the aggregate vacancy Ölling rate
which the representative Örm takes as given. Posting vacancies is costless. We assume that
the representative Örm is large, so that if it posts xt lt!1 =Qt vacancies, then it meets exactly
xt lt!1 workers.
Free entry ensures that Örms make zero proÖts in equilibrium. That is, the cost of meeting
a worker must equal the value of a match:
. 3t P = Jt ;

(2.18)

where the objects in (2.18) are expressed in units of the Önal good.
At the beginning of the period; the representative wholesaler is in contact with a total
of lt workers (see equation (2.4)). This pool of workers includes workers with whom the Örm
was matched in the previous period, plus the new workers that the Örm has just met. Each
worker in lt engages in bilateral bargaining with a representative of the wholesaler, taking
the outcome of all other negotiations as given. We assume that bargaining occurs after the
realization of the technology shocks, but before the realization of the monetary policy shock.
Denote the equilibrium real wage rate by
wt - Wt =Pt :
In equilibrium all bargaining sessions conclude successfully, so the representative wholesaler
employs lt workers: Production begins immediately after wage negotiations are concluded and
the wholesaler sells the intermediate good at the real price, #t - Pth =Pt .
Consistent with Hall and Milgrom (2008) (HM) and CET, we assume that wages are
determined according to the alternating o§er bargaining protocol proposed in Rubinstein
11

(1982) and Binmore, Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1986). Let wtp denote the expected present
discounted value of the wage payments by a Örm to a worker that it is matched with:
p
wtp = wt + 'Et mt+1 wt+1
:

Here mt is the time t household discount factor which Örms and workers view as an exogenous stochastic process beyond their control. This discount factor is deÖned as follows.
Let JC;t denote the multiplier on the household budget constraint, (2.9), in the Lagrangian
representation of the household problem. Then, mt+1 - EJC;t+1 Pt+1 = (JC;t Pt ) :
The value of a worker to the Örm, Jt ; can be expressed as follows:
Jt = #pt % wtp :
Here #pt denotes the expected present discounted value of the marginal revenue product
associated with a worker to the Örm:
#pt = #t + 'Et mt+1 #pt+1 :

(2.19)

We now deÖne the value of the typical household member in each of the three labor
market states. In each case, the áow value experienced by the labor market member is the
marginal contribution of that member to household utility, (2.7), measured in units of the
market consumption good. In each case we evaluate a time t value function at a point in time
when the time t labor force adjustment costs are sunk. In the case of an employed worker,
the contribution to household welfare is simply the real wage, wt : Let Vt denote the value to
a worker of being matched with a Örm that pays wt in period t: Then,
%
$
Vt = wt + Et mt+1 ['Vt+1 + (1 % ') s ft+1 V/t+1 + (1 % ft+1 ) Ut+1

(2.20)

+ (1 % ') (1 % s) (Lt+1 + Nt+1 )]:

The Örst of the period t + 1 terms reáect that with probability, '; todayís match persists in
period t + 1 with the household member enjoying utility, Vt+1 : With probability 1 % ' the
match breaks up in which case there are three possibilities. First, with probability s the
household member remains in the labor force, in which case the household member meets
another Örm with probability ft+1 and goes into unemployment with probability 1 % ft+1 :
Here, V/t+1 denotes the value of working for another Örm in period t + 1. In equilibrium,
V/t+1 = Vt+1 . Also, Ut+1 in (2.20) is the value of being an unemployed worker in period t + 1:
The third possibility for matches that break up is that the household member goes out of
the labor force. This happens with probability 1 % s: In this case, the worker gives rise to a
labor adjustment cost, which we denote by Lt+1 : The value of being out of the labor force,
after possible adjustment costs have been accounted for, is denoted by Nt+1 : The adjustment
12

costs incurred by a household member that moves from the labor force to non-participation
contributes the following to household welfare (see (2.6)):
Lt = Jt F1 (Lt ; Lt!1 ; . Lt ) + Et mt+1 Jt+1 F2 (Lt+1 ; Lt ; . Lt+1 ):
Here, Jt denotes the contribution to household utility of the non-market produced good, CtH ;
expressed in units of the market consumption good, Ct .8 Given our functional forms,
!
"1!$
Ct % bC/t!1
!
:
Jt =

1 % ! CtH % bC/t!1
It is convenient to rewrite (2.20) as follows:
Vt = wtp + At ;

(2.21)

where
#
&
At = (1 % ') Et mt+1 sft+1 V/t+1 + s (1 % ft+1 ) Ut+1 + (1 % s) (Lt+1 + Nt+1 ) (2.22)
+'Et mt+1 At+1 :

According to (2.21), Vt consists of two components. The Örst is the expected present value of
wages received by the worker from the Örm with which he is currently matched. The second
corresponds to the expected present value of the payments that a worker receives in all dates
and states when he is separated from that Örm.
We assume that the only contribution of unemployed workers to household resources is
unemployment compensation, . D
t Dt : Thus, the value of unemployment, Ut , is given by,
~
Ut = . D
t Dt + Ut :

(2.23)

The variable, U~t ; denotes the continuation value of unemployment:
U~t - Et mt+1 [sft+1 Vt+1 + s (1 % ft+1 ) Ut+1 + (1 % s) (Lt+1 + Nt+1 )] :

(2.24)

Expression (2.24) reáects our assumption that an unemployed worker Önds a job in the next
period with probability sft+1 ; remains unemployed with probability s (1 % ft+1 ) and exits the
labor force with probability 1 % s: In case the unemployed worker exits the labor market,
then he contributes to labor force adjustment costs by Lt+1 .
8

The derivative takes into account that Lt = 1 % Nt ; so that
d
L
F(Lt ; Lt%1 ; + L
t ) = %F1 (Lt ; Lt%1 ; + t ):
dNt

Also, ,t - ,H;t = (,C;t Pt ) where ,H;t & 0 denotes the multiplier on (2.6) in the Lagrangian representation of
the household problem, while ,C;t & 0 denotes the multiplier on the household budget constraint.

13

The value of non-participation is:
Nt = Jt . H
t + Et mt+1 [et+1 (ft+1 Vt+1 + (1 % ft+1 )Ut+1 % Lt+1 ) + (1 % et+1 ) Nt+1 ] :

(2.25)

Expression (2.25) reáects our assumption that a non-participating worker is selected to join
the labor force with probability et+1 ; deÖned in (2.3). In addition, (2.25) indicates that a
household member who does not participate in the labor force in period t and in period t + 1
does not contribute to labor force adjustment costs in period t + 1: However, the household
member that does not participate in the labor market in period t; but does participate in
period t + 1 gives rise to labor adjustment costs in t + 1: This is captured by %Lt+1 in (2.25).
H
Finally, the time t áow term in (2.25) is the marginal product of labor; . H
t ; in producing Ct ;
times the corresponding value, Jt :
The basic structure of alternating o§er bargaining is the same as it is in CET. Each
matched worker-Örm pair (both those who just matched for the Örst time and those who
were matched in the past) bargain over the current wage rate, wt : Each time period (a
quarter) is subdivided into M periods of equal length, where M is even. The Örm makes
a wage o§er at the start of the Örst subperiod. It also makes an o§er at the start of every
subsequent odd subperiod in the event that all previous o§ers have been rejected. Similarly,
workers make a wage o§er at the start of all even subperiods in case all previous o§ers have
been rejected. Because M is even, the last o§er is made, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, by the
worker. When the Örm rejects an o§er it pays a cost, . 6t Y; of making a countero§er. Here Y
is a positive scalar and . 6t is a process that ensures balanced growth.
In subperiod j = 1; :::; M % 1; the recipient of an o§er can either accept or reject it. If the
o§er is rejected the recipient may declare an end to the negotiations or he may plan to make
a countero§er at the start of the next subperiod. In the latter case there is a probability, B;
that bargaining breaks down and the wholesaler and worker revert to their outside option.
For the Örm, the value of the outside option is zero and for the worker the outside option
is unemployment.9 Given our assumptions, workers and Örms never choose to terminate
bargaining and go to their outside options.
It is always optimal for the Örm to o§er the lowest wage rate subject to the condition
that the worker does not reject it. To know what that wage rate is, the wholesaler must
know what the worker would countero§er in the event that the Örmís o§er was rejected. But,
the workerís countero§er depends on the Örmís countero§er in case the workerís countero§er
is rejected. We solve for the Örmís initial o§er beginning with the workerís Önal o§er and
working backwards. Since workers and Örms know everything about each other, the Örmís
opening wage o§er is always accepted.
9

We could allow for the possibility that when negotiations break down the worker has a chance of leaving
the labor force. To keep our analysis relatively simple, we do not allow for that possibility here.

14

Our environment is su¢ciently simple that the solution to the bargaining problem has
the following straightforward characterization:
$
%
Z1 Jt = Z2 (Vt % Ut ) % Z3 . 6t Y + Z4 #t % . D
t Dt

(2.26)

where E i = Zi+1 =Z1 ; for i = 1; 2; 3 and,

Z1 = 1 % B + (1 % B)M

Z2 = 1 % (1 % B)M
1%B
% Z1
Z3 = Z2
B
1 % B Z2
+ 1 % Z2 :
Z4 =
2%BM
The technical appendix contains a detailed derivation of (2.26) and describes the procedure
that we use for solving the bargaining problem.
To summarize, in period t the problem of wholesalers is to choose the hiring rate, xt ;
and to bargain with the workers that they meet. These activities occur before the monetary
policy shock is realized and after the other shocks are realized.
2.6. Innovations to Technology
In this section we describe the laws of motion of technology: Turning to the investment-speciÖc
shock, we assume that ln \';t - ln (5t =5t!1 ) follows an AR(1) process:
ln \';t = (1 % '' ) ln \' + '' ln \';t!1 + ] ' "';t :
Here, "';t is the innovation in ln \';t ; i.e., the error in the one-step-ahead forecast of ln \';t
based on the history of past observations of ln \';t :
For reasons explained later, it is convenient for our post-2008 analysis to adopt a components representation for neutral technology.10 In particular, we assume that the growth rate
of neutral technology is the sum of a permanent (\P;t ) and a transitory (\T;t ) component:
ln(\z;t ) = ln (zt =zt!1 ) = ln(\z ) + \P;t + \T;t ;

(2.27)

\P;t = 'P \P;t!1 + ] P "P;t ; j'P j < 1;

(2.28)

\T;t = 'T \T;t!1 + ] T ("T;t % "T;t!1 ); j'T j < 1:

(2.29)

where

and
10

Unobserved components representations have played an important role in macroeconomic analysis. See,
for example, Erceg and Levin (2003) and Edge, Laubach and Williams (2007).

15

In (2.28) and (2.29), "P;t and "T;t are mean zero, unit variance, iid shocks. To see why (2.29)
is the transitory component of ln (zt ), suppose \P;t - 0 so that \T;t is the only component of
technology and (ignoring the constant term) ln(\z;t ) = \T;t ; or
ln(\z;t ) = ln (zt ) % ln (zt!1 ) = 'T (ln (zt!1 ) % ln (zt!2 )) + ] T ("T;t % "T;t!1 ):
Diving by 1 % L; where L denotes the lag operator, we have:
ln (zt ) = 'T ln (zt!1 ) + ] T "T;t :
Thus, a shock to "T;t has only a transient e§ect on the forecast of ln (zt ). By contrast a shock,
say 7"P;t ; to "P;t shifts Et ln (zt+j ), j ! 1 by the amount, 7"P;t = (1 % 'P ) :
We assume that when there is a shock to ln (zt ) ; agents do not know whether it reáects
the permanent or the temporary component. As a result, they must solve a signal extraction
problem when they adjust their forecast of future values of ln (zt ) in response to an unanticipated move in ln (zt ) : Suppose, for example, there is a shock to "P;t ; but that agents believe
most áuctuations in ln (zt ) reáect shocks to "T;t : In this case they will adjust their near term
forecast of ln (zt ) ; leaving their longer-term forecast of ln (zt ) una§ected. As time goes by and
agents see that the change in ln (zt ) is too persistent to be due to the transitory component,
the long-run component of their forecast of ln (zt ) begins to adjust. Thus, a disturbance in
"P;t triggers a sequence of forecast errors for agents who cannot observe whether a shock to
ln(zt ) originates in the temporary or permanent component of ln(\z;t ).
Because agents do not observe the components of technology directly, they do not use
the components representation to forecast technology growth. For forecasting, they use the
univariate Wold representation that is implied by the components representation. The shocks
to the permanent and transitory components of technology enter the system by perturbing
the error in the Wold representation. To clarify these observations we Örst construct the
Wold representation.
Multiply ln(\z;t ) in (2.27) by (1 % 'P L) (1 % 'T L) ; where L denotes the lag operator:
(1 % 'P L) (1 % 'T L) ln(\z;t ) = (1 % 'T L) ] P "P;t + (1 % 'P L) (] T "T;t % ] T "T;t!1 ) :

(2.30)

Let the stochastic process on the right of the equality be denoted by Wt . Evidently, Wt has
a second order moving average representation, which we express in the following form:
%
$
Wt = 1 % ^1 L % ^2 L2 ] ; . t ; E. t = 1:

(2.31)

We obtain a mapping from 'P ; 'T ; ] P ; ] T to ^1 ; ^2 ; ] ; by Örst computing the variance and
two lagged covariances of the object to the right of the Örst equality in (2.30). We then
Önd the values of ^1 ; ^2 ; and ] ; for which the variance and two lagged covariances of Wt
16

and the object on the right of the equality in (2.30) are the same. In addition, we require
that the eigenvalues in the moving average representation of Wt ; (2.31), lie inside the unit
circle. The latter condition is what guarantees that the shock in the Wold representation is
the innovation in technology. In sum, the Wold representation for ln(\z;t ) is:
%
$
(1 % 'P L) (1 % 'T L) ln(\z;t ) = 1 % ^1 L % ^2 L2 ] ; . t :
(2.32)
The mapping from the structural shocks, "P;t and "T;t , to . t is obtained by equating the
objects on the right of the equalities in (2.30) and (2.31):
. t = ^1 . t!1 + ^2 . t!1 +

]P
]T
("P;t % 'T "P;t!1 ) + (1 % 'P L)
("T;t % "T;t!1 ) :
];
];

(2.33)

According to this expression, if there is a positive disturbance to "P;t ; this triggers a sequence
of one-step-ahead forecast errors for agents, consistent with the intuition described above.11
When we estimate our model, we treat the innovation in technology, . t ; as a primitive and
are not concerned with the decomposition of . t into the "P;t ís and "T;t ís. In e§ect, we replace
the unobserved components representation of the technology shock with its representation in
(2.32). That representation is an autoregressive, moving average representation with two autoregressive parameters, two moving average parameters and a standard deviation parameter.
Thus, in principle it has Öve free parameters. But, since the Wold representation is derived
from the unobserved components model, it has only four free parameters. SpeciÖcally, we
estimate the following parameters: 'P ; 'T ; ] P and the ratio <<PT :
Although we do not make use of the decomposition of the innovation, . t ; into the structural
shocks when we estimate our model, it turns out that the decomposition is very useful for
interpreting the post-2008 data.
2.7. Market Clearing, Monetary Policy and Functional Forms
The total supply of the intermediate good is given by lt which equals the total quantity of
labor used by the wholesalers. So, clearing in the market for intermediate goods requires
ht = lt ;
where
ht -

The capital services market clearing condition is:
Z 1

u t Kt =

11

An alternative approach to agentsí forecasting problem is to set it up as a Kalman Öltering problem. One
can show that the solution to that problem and the one obtained with our Wold representation coincide.

17

Market clearing for Önal goods requires:
3
Ct + (It + a(uK
t )Kt )=5t + . t Pxt lt!1 + Gt = Yt :

(2.35)

The right hand side of the previous expression denotes the quantity of Önal goods. The
left hand side represents the various ways that Önal goods are used. Homogeneous output,
Yt ; can be converted one-for-one into either consumption goods, goods used to hire workers,
or government purchases, Gt . In addition, some of Yt is absorbed by capital utilization
costs. Homogeneous output, Yt can also be used to produce investment goods using a linear
technology in which one unit of the Önal good is transformed into 5t units of It : Perfect
competition in the production of investment goods implies,
PI;t =

Pt
:
5t

Clearing in the loan market requires that the demand for loans by retailers, {ht Pth ; equals
the supply, Bt+1 =Rt :
Bt+1
{ht Pth =

Rt
We adopt the following speciÖcation of monetary policy:
(2.36)
ln(Rt =R) = 'R ln(Rt!1 =R)
"/

!
`t

+ (1 % 'R ) 0:25r= ln

`

O

12
The object, ` A
where ` A
t - Pt =Pt!4 and ` is the monetary authorityís ináation target.
is also the value of ` A
t in nonstochastic steady state. The shock, "R;t ; is a unit variance, zero
mean and serially uncorrelated disturbance to monetary policy. The variable, Ot ; denotes
Gross Domestic Product:
Ot = Ct + It =5t + Gt ;

where Gt denotes government consumption, which is assumed to have the following representation:
(2.37)
Gt = . gt gt :
Here, . gt is a process that guarantees balanced growth and gt is an exogenous stochastic
process. The constant, \A
O ; is the value of Ot =Ot!4 in nonstochastic steady state: Also, R
denotes the steady state value of Rt : Finally, we require that money demand equals money
supply.
12

We also estimated a version of the model in which the output gap, i.e. the level of output relative to
its balanced growth path, enters the monetary policy rule. We always found the estimated coe¢cient on the
output gap to be very small.

18

The sources of long-term growth in our model are the neutral and investment-speciÖc
technological progress shocks discussed in the previous subsection. The growth rate in steady
state for the model variables is a composite, 9t ; of these two technology shocks:
(

9t = 5t1!( zt :
The variables Yt =9t ; Ct =9t ; wt =9t and It =(5t 9t ) converge to constants in nonstochastic steady
state.
If objects like the Öxed cost of production, the cost of hiring, etc., were constant, they
would become irrelevant over time. To avoid this implication, it is standard in the literature
to suppose that such objects are proportional to the underlying source of growth, which is
9t in our setting. However, this assumption has the unfortunate implication that technology
shocks of both types have an immediate e§ect on the vector of objects

Such a speciÖcation seems implausible and so we instead proceed as in Christiano, Trabandt
and Walentin (2012) and Schmitt-GrohÈ and Uribe (2012). In particular, we suppose that
the objects in :t are proportional to a long moving average of composite technology, 9t :
:i;t = 9At!1 (:i;t!1 )1!A ;

(2.39)

where :i;t denotes the ith element of :t , i = 1; :::; 7. Also, 0 < ^ ) 1 is a parameter to be
estimated. Note that :i;t has the same growth rate in steady state as GDP. When ^ is very
close to zero, :i;t is virtually unresponsive in the short-run to an innovation in either of the
two technology shocks, a feature that we Önd very attractive on a priori grounds.
We adopt the investment adjustment cost speciÖcation proposed in CEE. In particular,
we assume that the cost of adjusting investment takes the form:
hp
i
00
S (It =It!1 ) = 0:5 exp S (It =It!1 % \) 6 \' )
h p
i
+0:5 exp % S 00 (It =It!1 % \) 6 \' ) % 1:

Here, \) and \' denote the steady state growth rates of 9t and 5t . The value of It =It!1 in
nonstochastic steady state is (\) 6 \' ): In addition, S 00 represents a model parameter that
coincides with the second derivative of S (+), evaluated in steady state: It is straightforward
to verify that S (\) 6 \' ) = S 0 (\) 6 \' ) = 0: Our speciÖcation of the adjustment costs has
the convenient feature that the steady state of the model is independent of the value of S 00 :
The adjustment cost function for the labor force is speciÖed as follows:
F(Lt ; Lt!1 ; . Lt ) = 0:5. Lt NL (Lt =Lt!1 % 1)2 :
19

(2.40)

We assume that the cost associated with setting capacity utilization is given by,
K 2
K
a(uK
t ) = 0:5] a ] b (ut ) + ] b (1 % ] a ) ut + ] b (] a =2 % 1)

where ] a and ] b are positive scalars. We normalize the steady state value of uK
t to unity,
so that the adjustment costs are zero in steady state, and ] b is equated to the steady state
of the appropriately scaled rental rate on capital. Our speciÖcation of the cost of capacity
utilization and our normalization of uK
t in steady state has the convenient implication that
the model steady state is independent of ] a :
Finally, we discuss the determination of the equilibrium vacancy Ölling rate, Qt : We posit
a standard matching function:
xt lt!1 = ] m (Lt % 'lt!1 )< (lt!1 vt )1!< ;

(2.41)

where lt!1 vt denotes the economy-wide average number of vacancies and vt denotes the aggregate vacancy rate. Then,
xt
(2.42)
Qt = :
vt

3. Data and Econometric Methodology for Pre-2008 Sample
We estimate our model using a Bayesian variant of the strategy in CEE that minimizes the
distance between the dynamic response to three shocks in the model and the analog objects
in the data. The latter are obtained using an identiÖed VAR for post-war quarterly U.S.
times series that include key labor market variables. The particular Bayesian strategy that
we use is the one developed in Christiano, Trabandt and Walentin (2011) (CTW).
CTW estimate a 14 variable VAR using quarterly data that are seasonally adjusted and
cover the period 1951Q1 to 2008Q4. To facilitate comparisons, our analysis is based on the
same VAR that CTW use. As in CTW, we identify the dynamic responses to a monetary
policy shock by assuming that the monetary authority observes the current and lagged values
of all the variables in the VAR, and that a monetary policy shock a§ects only the Federal
Funds Rate contemporaneously. As in Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Linde (2011),
Fisher (2006) and CTW, we make two assumptions to identify the dynamic responses to the
technology shocks: (i) the only shocks that a§ect labor productivity in the long-run are the
innovations to the neutral technology shock, . t ; and the innovations to the investment-speciÖc
technology shock "';t ; and (ii) the only shocks that a§ects the price of investment relative to
consumption in the long-run are the innovations to the investment-speciÖc technology shock
"';t . These assumptions are satisÖed in our model. Standard lag-length selection criteria
lead CTW to work with a VAR with 2 lags.13 The assumptions used to identify the e§ects
of monetary policy and technology shocks are satisÖed in our model.
13

See CTW for a sensitivity analysis with respect to the lag length of the VAR.

See section A of the technical appendix in CTW for details about the data. Here, we brieáy
discuss the job vacancy data. Our time series on vacancies splices together a help-wanted
index produced by the Conference Board with a job openings measure produced by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics in their Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). According
to JOLTS, a ëjob openingí is a position that the Örm would Öll in the event that a suitable
candidate appears. A job vacancy in our model corresponds to this deÖnition of a ëjob
openingí. To see this, recall that in our model the representative Örm is large. We can think
of our Örm as consisting of a large number of plants. Suppose that the Örm wants to hire
z people per plant when the vacancy Ölling rate is Q: The Örm instructs each plant to post
z=Q vacancies with the understanding that each vacancy which generates a job application
will be turned into a match.14 This is the sense in which vacancies in our model meet the
JOLTS deÖnition of a job opening. Of course, it is possible that the people responding to the
JOLTS survey report job opening numbers that correspond more closely to z: To the extent
that this is true, the JOLTS data should be thought of as a noisy indicator of vacancies in
our model. This measurement issue is not unique to our model. It arises in the standard
search and matching model (see, for example, Shimer, 2005).
Given an estimate of the VAR we compute the implied impulse response functions to the
three structural shocks. We stack the contemporaneous and 14 lagged values of each of these
impulse response functions for 13 of the variables listed above in a vector, ^ : We do not
include the job separation rate because that variable is constant in our model. We include
the job separation rate in the VAR to ensure the VAR results are not driven by an omitted
variable bias.
14

Some plants will hire more than z people and others will hire fewer. By the law of large numbers, there
is no uncertainty at the Örm level about how many people will be hired.

21

The logic underlying our model estimation procedure is as follows. Suppose that our
structural model is true. Denote the true values of the model parameters by ^0 : Let (^)
denote the model-implied mapping from a set of values for the model parameters to the
analog impulse responses in ^ : Thus, (^0 ) denotes the true value of the impulse responses
whose estimates appear in ^ : According to standard classical asymptotic sampling theory,
when the number of observations, T; is large, we have
( a
p '
T ^ % (^0 ) ~ N (0; W (^0 ; 7 0 )) :

Here, 7 0 denotes the true values of the parameters of the shocks in the model that we do not
formally include in the analysis. When we estimate the model we work with a log-linearized
solution. Consequently, (^0 ) is not a function of 7 0 : However, the sampling distribution of
^ is a function of 7 0 : We Önd it convenient to express the asymptotic distribution of ^ in the
following form:
a
^ ~ N ( (^0 ) ; V ) ;
(3.2)
where

W (^0 ; 7 0 )
:
T
For simplicity our notation does not make the dependence of V on ^0 ; 7 0 and T explicit. We
use a consistent estimator of V: Motivated by small sample considerations, that estimator has
only diagonal elements (see CTW). The elements in ^ are graphed in Figures 1 % 3 (see the
solid lines). The gray areas are centered, 95 percent probability intervals computed using our
estimate of V .
In our analysis, we treat ^ as the observed data. We specify priors for ^ and then compute
the posterior distribution for ^ given ^ using Bayesí rule. This computation requires the
likelihood of ^ given ^: Our asymptotically valid approximation of this likelihood is motivated
by (3.2):

The value of ^ that maximizes the above function represents an approximate maximum
likelihood estimator of ^: It is approximate for three reasons: (i) the central limit theorem
underlying (3.2) only holds exactly as T ! 1; (ii) our proxy for V is guaranteed to be correct
only for T ! 1; and (iii) (^) is calculated using a linear approximation.
Treating the function, f; as the likelihood of ^ ; it follows that the Bayesian posterior of
^ conditional on ^ and V is:

4. Empirical Results, Pre-2008 Sample
This section presents results for the estimated model. First, we discuss the priors and posteriors of structural parameters. Second, we discuss the ability of the model to account for
the dynamic response of the economy to a monetary policy shock, a neutral technology shock
and an investment-speciÖc technology shock.
4.1. Calibration and Parameter Values set a Priori
We set the values for a subset of the model parameters a priori. These values are reported in
Panel A of Table 1. We also set the steady state values of Öve endogenous model variables,
listed in Panel B of Table 1. We specify E so that the steady state annual real rate of interest
is three percent. The depreciation rate on capital, B K ; is set to imply an annual depreciation
rate of 10 percent. The growth rate of composite technology, \) ; is equated to the sample
average of real per capita GDP growth. The growth rate of investment-speciÖc technology,
\' ; is set so that (\) 6 \' ) is equal to the sample average of real, per capita investment
growth. We assume the monetary authorityís ináation target is 2 percent per year and that
the proÖts of intermediate good producers are zero in steady state. We set the steady state
value of the vacancy Ölling rate, Q; to 0:7; as in den Haan, Ramey and Watson (2000) and
Ravenna and Walsh (2008). The steady state unemployment rate, u; is set to the average
unemployment rate in our sample, 0:055. We assume the parameter M to be equal to 60
which roughly corresponds to the number of business days in a quarter. We set ' = 0:9;
which implies a match survival rate that is consistent with both Hall and Milgrom (2008)
and Shimer (2012). Finally, we assume that the steady state value of the ratio of government
consumption to gross output is 0:2.
Two additional parameters pertain to the household sector. We set the elasticity of
substitution in household utility between home and market produced goods, (1 % b)= (1 % 6) ;
to 3. SpeciÖcally, we estimate the consumption habit parameter b and always set 6 so
that (1 % b)= (1 % 6) = 3: This magnitude of the elasticity of substitution is similar to the

23

estimate in Aguiar, Hurst and Karabarbounis (2013).15 We set the steady state labor force
to population ratio, L; to 0:67.
To make the model consistent with the 5 calibrated values for L; Q; G=Y; u; and prof its,
we select values for 5 parameters: the weight of market consumption in the utility function, !;
the constant in front of the matching function, ] m ; the Öxed cost of production, N; the cost for
the Örm to make a countero§er, Y; and the scale parameter, g; in government consumption.
The values for these parameters, evaluated at the posterior mean of the set of parameters
that we estimate, are reported in Table 3.16
4.2. Parameter Estimation
The priors and posteriors for the model parameters about which we do Bayesian inference
are summarized in Table 2. A number of features of the posterior mean of the estimated
parameters of our model are worth noting.
First, the posterior mean of O implies a moderate degree of price stickiness, with prices
changing on average once every 4 quarters. This value lies within the range reported in the
literature.
Second, the posterior mean of B implies that there is a 0:13 percent chance of an exogenous
break-up in negotiations when a wage o§er is rejected.
Third, the posterior modes of our model parameters, along with the assumption that the
steady state unemployment rate equals 5:5 percent; implies that it costs Örms about 0:6 days
of marginal revenue to prepare a countero§er during wage negotiations (see Table 3).
Fourth, the posterior mean of steady state hiring costs as a percent of gross output is
equal to 0:5 percent. This result implies that steady state hiring costs as a percent of total
wages of newly-hired workers is equal to 7 percent. Silva and Toledo (2009) report that,
depending on the exact costs included, the value of this statistic is between 4 and 14 percent,
a range that encompasses the corresponding statistic in our model
Fifth, the posterior mean of the replacement ratio is 0:32. HM summarize the literature
and report a range of estimates from 0:12 to 0:36 for the replacement ratio. So our estimate
falls within their range. It is well known that Diamond (1982), Mortensen (1982) and Pis15

We take our elasticity of substitution parameter from the literature to maintain comparability. However,
there is a caveat. To understand this, recall the deÖnition of the elasticity of substitution. It is the percent
change in C=C H in response to a one percent change in the corresponding relative price, say ,. From an
empirical standpoint, it is di¢cult to obtain a direct measure of this elasticity because we do not have data
on C H or ,: As a result, structural relations must be assumed, which map from observables to C H and ,:
Since estimates of the elasticity are presumably dependent on the details of the structural assumptions, it is
not clear how to compare values of this parameter across di§erent studies, which make di§erent structural
assumptions.
16
The posterior means and distributions of parameters are based on a standard MCMC algorithm with
500.000 draws (100.000 draws used for burn-in, draw acceptance rate is 0.24).

24

sarides (1985) (DMP) style models with Nash wage bargaining require a replacement ratio
in excess of 0:9 to account for áuctuations in labor markets (see e.g. CET for an extended
discussion). For the reasons stressed in CET, alternating o§er bargaining between workers
and Örms mutes the sensitivity of real wages to aggregate shocks. This property underlies
our modelís ability to account for the estimated response of the economy to monetary policy shocks and shocks to neutral and investment-speciÖc technology with a relatively low
replacement ratio.
Sixth, the posterior mean of s implies that a separated or unemployed worker leaves the
labor force with probability 1 % s = 0:16: As a practical matter, we found that there was only
little information in the data about s:
Seventh, the posterior mean of ^ which governs the responsiveness of the elements of :t to
technology shocks, is small (0:11). So, variables like government purchases and unemployment
beneÖts are quite unresponsive in the short-run to technology shocks.
Eighth, the posterior means of the parameters governing monetary policy are similar to
those reported in the literature (see for example Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti, 2010).
Ninth, we turn to the parameters of the unobserved components representation of the
neutral technology shock. According to the posterior mean, the standard deviation of the
shock to the transient component is roughly 5 times the standard deviation of the permanent
component. So, according to the posterior mean, most of the áuctuations (at least, at a
short horizon) are due to the transitory component of neutral technology. The permanent
component of neutral technology has an autocorrelation of roughly 0:75, so that a minus one
percent shock to the permanent component eventually drives the level of technology down by
about 4 percent. The temporary component is also fairly highly autocorrelated.
Many authors conclude that the growth rate of neutral technology follows roughly a
random walk (see, for example, Prescott, 1986). Our model is consistent with this view. We
Önd that the Örst order autocorrelation of ln (zt =zt!1 ) in our model is 0:01; which is very
close to zero. For discussions of how a components representation, in which the components
are both highly autocorrelated, can nevertheless generate a process that looks like a random
walk, see Christiano and Eichenbaum (1990) and Quah (1990).
Tenth, the posterior mean of the fraction of retailersí intermediate input bill, {; that must
be Önanced by working capital, is equal to 0:56:
Table 4 reports the frequency with which workers transit between the three states that
they can be in. The table reports the steady state frequencies implied by the model and the
analog statistics calculated from data from the Current Population Survey. Note that we
did not use these data statistics when we estimated or calibrated the model.17 Nevertheless,
17

Our data does include the job Önding rate. However, our impulse response matching procedure only uses
the dynamics of that variable and not its level.

25

with two minor exceptions, the model does very well at accounting for those statistics of the
data. The exceptions are that the model somewhat understates the frequency of transition
from unemployment into unemployment and slightly overstates the frequency of transition
from unemployment to out-of-the labor force. Finally, we note that in the data over half of
newly employed people are hired from other jobs (see Diamond 2010, page 316). Our model
is consistent with this fact: in the steady state of the model, roughly 53 percent of newly
employed workers in a given quarter come from other jobs.18
Overall, we view these Öndings as additional evidence in support of the notion that our
model of the labor market is empirically plausible.
4.3. Impulse Response Functions
The thin solid lines in Figures 1-3 present the impulse response functions to a monetary policy
shock, a neutral technology shock and an investment-speciÖc technology shock implied by the
estimated VAR. The gray areas represent 95 percent probability intervals. The thick solid
lines correspond to the impulse response functions of our model evaluated at the posterior
mean of the structural parameters. The thin dashed lines correspond to the 95 percent
highest probability density interval for the model impulse response functions. Figure 1 shows
that the model does a reasonable job at reproducing the estimated e§ects of an expansionary
monetary policy shock, including the hump-shaped rises in real GDP and hours worked,
the rise in the labor force participation rate and the muted response of ináation. Notice
that real wages respond by much less than hours worked to a monetary policy shock. Even
though the maximal rise in hours worked is roughly 0:15 percent, the maximal rise in real
wages is only 0:04 percent. SigniÖcantly, the model accounts for the hump-shaped fall in
the unemployment rate as well as the rise in the job Önding rate and vacancies that occur
after an expansionary monetary policy shock. The model does understate the rise in the
capacity utilization rate. The sharp rise of capacity utilization in the estimated VAR may
reáect that our data on the capacity utilization rate pertains to the manufacturing sector,
which probably overstates the average response across all sectors in the economy.
From Figure 2 we see that the model does a good job of accounting for the estimated
e§ects of a negative innovation, . t ; to neutral technology (see (2.32)). Note that the model
is able to account for the initial fall and subsequent persistent rise in the unemployment
rate. The model also accounts for the initial rise and subsequent fall in vacancies and the job
Önding rate after a negative shock to neutral technology. The model is consistent with the
18

We reached this conclusion as follows. Workers starting a new job at the start of period t come from
three states: employment, unemployment and not-in-the labor force. The quantities of these people are
(1 % 1) lt%1 sft ; ft sut%1 Lt%1 and ft et (1 % Lt ) ; respectively. We computed these three objects in steady state
using the information in Tables 1, 2 and 3. The fraction reported in the text is the ratio of the Örst number
to the sum of all three.

26

relatively small response of the labor force participation rate to a neutral technology shock.
Turning to the response of ináation after a negative neutral technology shock, note that
our VAR implies that the maximal response occurs in the period of the shock.19 Our model
has no problem reproducing this observation. See CTW for intuition.
Figure 3 reports the VAR-based estimates of the responses to an investment-speciÖc technology shock. The Ögure also displays the responses to "';t implied by our model evaluated
at the posterior mean of the parameters. Note that in all cases the model impulses lie in the
95 percent probability interval of the VAR-based impulse responses.
Viewed as a whole, the results of this section provide evidence that our model does well
at accounting for the cyclical properties of key labor market and other macro variables in the
pre-2008 period.

5. Modeling The Great Recession
In this section we provide a quantitative characterization of the Great Recession. We suppose
that the economy was bu§eted by a sequence of shocks that began in 2008Q3. Using simple
projection methods, we estimate how the economy would have evolved in the absence of
those shocks. The di§erence between how the economy would have evolved and how it did
evolve is what we deÖne as the Great Recession. We then extend our modeling framework to
incorporate four candidate shocks that in principle could have caused or impacted economic
activity in the Great Recession. In addition, we provide an interpretation of monetary policy
during the Great Recession, allowing for a binding ZLB and forward guidance. Finally, we
discuss our strategy for stochastically simulating our model.
5.1. Characterizing the Great Recession
The solid lines in Figure 4 display the behavior of key macroeconomic variables since 2001
which corresponds to the start of the recession prior to the Great Recession. Our sample
ends in 2013Q2. Note that we include two measures of the spread between the corporateborrowing rate and the interest rate paid by the US government. Given the importance of
these spreads we display their behavior from 1985Q1 to provide a better perspective on their
evolution. Our benchmark spread measure corresponds to the one constructed in Gilchrist
and Zakrajöek (2012) (GZ). These data are displayed in the (4,1) element of Figure 4. The
(4,2) element of Figure 4 displays the Moodyís seasoned Baa corporate bond yield relative to
the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond.
19

This Önding is consistent with results in e.g. Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Linde (2011) and Paciello
(2011).

27

A number of features in Figure 4 are worth noting. First, there was a large drop in per
capita GDP. While some growth began in late 2009, per capita GDP has still not returned to
its pre-crisis level as of the end of our sample. Second, there was a very substantial decline
in consumption and investment. While the latter showed strong growth since late 2009 it
has not yet surpassed its pre-crisis peak in per capita terms. Strikingly, although per capita
consumption initially grew starting in late 2009, it stopped growing around the middle of
2012. The stop of consumption growth is mirrored by a slowdown in the growth rate of GDP
and investment at around the same time. Interestingly, this time period coincides with the
events surrounding the debt ceiling crisis and the sequester. For example, in Spring 2012,
Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke warned lawmakers of a ëmassive Öscal cli§í involving
year-end tax increases and spending cuts.20
Third, vacancies dropped sharply in late 2008 and then rebounded almost to their prerecession levels. At the same time, unemployment rose sharply, but then only fell modestly.
Kocherlakota (2010) interprets these observations as implying that Örms had positions to Öll,
but the unemployed workers were simply not suitable. This explanation is often referred to
as the mismatch hypothesis. Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2012) provide a di§erent
interpretation of these observations. In their view, what matters for Ölling jobs is the intensity
of Örmsí recruiting e§orts, not vacancies per se. They argue that the intensity with which
Örms recruited workers after 2009 did not rebound in the same way that vacancies did.
Perhaps surprisingly, our model can account for the joint behavior of unemployment and
vacancies, even though the forces stressed by Kocherlakota and Davis, et al. are absent from
our framework.
Fourth, we note that despite the steep drop in GDP, ináation dropped by only about
1 to 1:5 percentage points. Authors like Hall (2011) argue that this joint observation is
particularly challenging for NK models.
Finally, note that both measures of the corporate bond spread rose sharply in the middle
of 2008. While the spreads have declined from their peak levels, both are still elevated
relative to their historical averages. Also, both spreads are higher than their values at the
end of 2007 and substantially above their values in the ten years prior to the Great Recession.
Interestingly, the Moodyís spread measure has not come down quite as much as the GZ spread.
The persistence in the rise of the corporate spread plays an important role in our analysis
below.
Target Gap Ranges
20

According
to
the
Hu¢ngton
Post
(http://www.hu¢ngtonpost.com/2012/12/27/Öscal-cli§2013_n_2372034.html) in Autumn of 2012, many economists warned that if left unaddressed, concerns
about the ëÖscal cli§í, could trigger a recession.

28

To assess how the economy would have evolved absent the large shocks associated with
the Great Recession, we adopt a simple and transparent procedure. For each variable, we
Öt a linear trend from date x to 2008Q2, where x 2 f1985Q1; 2003Q1g.21 To characterize
what the data would have looked like absent the shocks that caused the Önancial crisis and
Great Recession, we extrapolate the trend line for each variable. According to our model, all
the nonstationary variables in the analysis are di§erence stationary. Our linear extrapolation
procedure implicitly assumes that the shocks in the estimation period were small relative
to the drift terms in the time series. Given this assumption, our extrapolation procedure
approximately identiÖes how the data would have evolved, absent shocks after 2008Q2.
For each value of x, we calculate, at various horizons, the di§erence between the projected
value of each variable and its actual value. We refer to this di§erence as the target gaps. If
we knew the ëcorrectí value of x; these target gaps would represent our estimates of the
economic e§ects of the shocks that hit the economy in 2008Q3 and later. In e§ect, these
target gaps would be the objects that we are trying to explain. But we do not know the
correct value of x. So we construct the min-max range for the target gaps, using all the
values of x 2 f1985Q1; 2003Q1g: The min-max ranges of the target gaps for all the variables
correspond to the gray intervals displayed in Figures 7 and 8.22 The objective is to assess
whether, given plausible shocks, the model implied values of the endogenous variables in the
post 2008Q2 period are within the target gap ranges depicted in Figures 7 and 8.
Some features of these target gap ranges are worth emphasizing. First, any projection
of the values for the labor force and employment after 2008Q2 are controversial because of
ongoing demographic changes in the U.S. population. Our procedure attributes a mean target
gap decline by 2013Q2 of roughly 2:0 percentage points due to cyclical factors. Projections for
the labor force to population ratio published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in November
2007 suggest that the cyclical component in the decline in this ratio was roughly 2 percentage
points.23 In contrast, Reifschneider, Wascher and Wilcox (2013) and Sullivan (2013) estimate
that the cyclical component of the decline in the labor force to population ratio is equal to
1 percentage point and 0:75 percentage points, respectively. The range of the target gaps
for the labor force participation rate displayed in Figure 4 indicates considerable uncertainty
about the precise value to be targeted.
Second, according to Figure 8, the mean fall of the employment to population ratio is
21
In a previous draft of this paper we only considered x equal to 2001Q1. Hall (2014) uses a procedure
identical to ours corresponding to a value of x equal to 1990Q1.
22
There are of course many alternative procedures for projecting the behavior of the economy. For example,
we could use separate ARMA time series models for each of the variables or we could use multivariate
methods including the VAR estimated with pre-2008Q2 data. A challenge for a multivariate approach is the
nonlinearity associated with the ZLB. Still, it would be interesting to pursue alternative projection approaches
in the future.
23
See Erceg and Levin (2013), Figure 1.

29

about 4 percent. According to Figure 4, actual employment to population fell by about 5
percent. So, our procedure ascribes 20 percent of the actual fall of employment to non-cyclical
factors. Krugman (2014) and Shimer (2014) argue that 1=3 of the fall in the employment
to population ratio is due to non-cyclical factors. So, like us, they ascribe a relatively small
portion of the fall to non-cyclical factors. In contrast, Tracy and Kapon (2014) argue that
the cyclical component of the decline was smaller.
5.2. The Shocks Driving the Great Recession
We suppose that the Great Recession was triggered by four shocks. Two of these shocks are
wedges which capture in a reduced form way frictions which are widely viewed as having
been important during the Great Recession. The other sources of shocks that we allow for
are government consumption and technology.
The Consumption Wedge
The Örst shock that we consider is a shock to households preferences for safe and/or liquid
assets. We capture this shock by introducing a perturbation, 7bt ; to agentsí intertemporal
Euler equation associated with saving via risk-free bonds. The object, 7bt ; is the consumption
wedge we discussed in the introduction. The Euler equation associated with the nominal riskfree bond is given by:
%
$
(5.1)
1 = 1 + 7bt Et mt+1 Rt =` t+1 :
See Fisher (2014) for a discussion of how a positive realization of 7bt can, to a Örst-order
approximation, be interpreted as reáecting an increase in the demand for risk-free bonds.24
We obtain an empirical measure of 7bt as follows. As it turns out ex-post measures of the
time series on mt+1 implied by the estimated version of our model donít display substantial
variation over time. So that we set mt+1 = E: Ignoring covariance terms, equation (5.1) can
then be written as,
%
$
(5.2)
1 + 7bt = Et ` t+1 =(ERt )

In conjunction with federal funds rate data on Rt and measuring Et ` t+1 using the onequarter ahead core CPI-ináation forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, (5.2)
yields a time series on 7bt . We then apply the procedure discussed above to compute target
gaps to obtain measures of 7bt : The results are displayed in the (1,2) element of Figure 7.
It is clear that there is substantial uncertainty about the target gaps for 7bt stemming from
uncertainty about the estimation period for the linear trend.
24

The shock is also similar to the ëáight-to-qualityí shock found to play a substantial role in the start of
the Great Depression in Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2003).

30

We assume that agents forecast 7bt using the following AR(2) process:
7bt = 1:57bt!1 % :567bt!2 + "bt ;
where "bt is a mean zero, unit variance iid shock. The steady state value of 7bt is zero. This
process implies that at each point in time, agents forecast a persistent rise in 7bt consistent
with the mean target gap.
We assume that the actual sequence of values of 7bt that occurred after 2008Q1 is depicted
by the solid line with circles in the (1,2) element of Figure 7. This sequence is identical to
the mean target gap until 2010Q4 and is constant at the 2010Q4 value thereafter. Notice
that the actual mean of the target gap rises in 2011Q1. If we assume a target gap consistent
with that rise, then the model would generate a pronounced and counterfactual contraction
beginning in 2011Q1. Our assumption that 7bt is constant amounts to an informal estimate
of that shock using the structure of the model.25
The Financial Wedge
The second shock that we consider is a shock to agentsí intertemporal Euler equation for
capital accumulation:

where 7kt denotes Rt+1
% Rt : The time period in our model is quarterly, but the average
duration of the bonds in GZís data is about 7 years. We suppose that the 7kt ís are related
to the GZ spread as follows:
/
- k
7t + 7kt+1 + ::: + 7kt+27
(5.4)
j:t ;
Bt = E
7

where Bt denotes the GZ spread minus the projection of that spread as of 2008Q2. Also,
:t denotes the information available to agents at time t: In (5.4) we sum over 7kt+j for
j = 0; :::; 27 because 7kt is a tax on the one quarter return to capital while Bt applies to t + j;
25

Nonlinear versions of standard Kalman smoothing methods could be used to estimate the sequences of all
the exogenous shocks in the post 2008Q2 data. In practice, this approach is computationally challenging and
we defer it to future work. See e.g. Gust, Lopez-Salido and Smith (2013) who estimate a nonlinear DSGE
model subject to an occasionally binding ZLB constraint.

31

j = 0; 1; :::; 27 (i.e., 7 years). Also, we divide the sum in (5.4) by 7 to take into account that
7kt is measured in quarterly decimal terms while our empirical measure of Bt is measured in
annual decimal terms.
We assume that agents forecast Bt using a mean zero, Örst order autoregressive representation (AR(1)), with autoregressive coe¢cient, '+ = 0:5: This low value of '+ captures the
idea that agents thought the sharp increase in the Önancial wedge was transitory in nature.
To solve their problem, agents actually work with the 7kt ís. But, for any sequence, Bt ; Et Bt+j ;
j = 1; 2; ::: , they can compute a sequence, 7kt ; Et 7kt+j ; j = 1; 2; 3; ::: that satisÖes (5.4).26
We assume that the actual sequence of values of Bt that occurred after 2008Q1 is depicted
by the solid line with circles in the (1,1) element of Figure 7. If we assume that Bt is equal
to the mean value of the target gap depicted in Figure 7, then the model counterfactually
implies that the recovery from the Great Recession would have began around mid-2011. Our
assumptions about Bt amount to an informal estimate of that shock using the structure of the
model. It is important to recall that the Moodyís spread displays somewhat more persistence
than the GZ spread. In the appendix we derive the target gaps for the Önancial wedge using
the Moodyís spread. We show that those target gaps are persistently more elevated than
those associated with the GZ spread. So the values that we assume for the target gap in our
analysis are within the combined range of uncertainty stemming from which ëcorrectí spread
measure to use and when to begin the linear trend calculation.
There are at least two interpretations of the Önancial wedge, 7kt . The Örst interpretation
is that it reáects variations in bankruptcy costs and other costs of Önancial intermediation.27
k
Under the second interpretation, the rate of return on capital, Rt+1
; is earned by non-Önancial
Örms who Önance their acquisition of capital by issuing bonds to households. Under this
interpretation, a rise in the Önancial wedge represents an unobserved fall in the desirability of
these bonds. The fall could reáect a change in the risk premium associated with non-Önancial
Örms or the perception that the securities issued by such Örms are more di¢cult to sell in case
a liquidity need arises. Gilchrist and Zakrajöek (2012) argue that the second interpretation
is quantitatively more important than the bankruptcy interpretation, especially in the recent
crisis. While we are sympathetic to their view, our analysis does not require us to take a
stand on the relative plausibility of the two interpretations of the Önancial wedge. The only
distinction between the two interpretations lies in their impact on the resource constraint.
The quantitative magnitude of this impact is likely to be very small.28
Recall that Örms Önance a fraction, {; of the intermediate input in advance of revenues
(see (2.16)). In contrast to the existing DSGE literature, we allow for a risky working capital

In performing this computation, we impose that Et 't+j ! 0 and Et (kt+j ! 0 as j ! 1.

where { = 0:56; as estimated (see Table 2). The risky working capital channel captures in a
reduced form way the frictions modeled in e.g. Bigio (2013). As a practical matter we think
of our measure of 7kt as a noisy signal of the actual wedge in the market for working capital.
In practice the latter wedge is given by
^ kt = 0:337kt
7
We found that if the Önancial and working capital wedges were equal the model generates
a counterfactually high level of ináation during the Great Recession. Our assumption that
the working capital wedge is about 1=3 as large the Önancial wedge amounts to an informal
estimate of that shock using the structure of the model.

Total Factor Productivity (TFP) Shocks
We now turn to a discussion of TFP. Various measures produced by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) are reported in the (1,1) panel of Figure 5. Each measure is the log of valueadded minus the log of capital and labor services weighted by their shares in the income
generated in producing the measure of value-added.29 In each case, we report a linear trend
line Ötted to the data from 2001Q1 through 2008Q2. The start date corresponds to the start
of the recession prior to the Great Recession. We then project the numbers forward after
2008Q2. We do the same for three additional measures of TFP in the (1,2) panel of Figure
5. Two are taken from Fernald (2012) and the third is taken from the Penn World Tables.
The bottom panel of Figure 5 displays log TFP minus the post-2008Q2 projection for log
TFP. Note that, with one exception, (i) TFP is below its pre-2008 trend during the Great
Recession, and (ii) it remains well below its pre-2008 trend all the way up to the end of our
data set. The exception is Fernaldís (2012) utilization adjusted TFP measure, which brieáy
rises above trend in 2009. Features (i) and (ii) of TFP play an important role in our empirical
results.
To assess the robustness of (i) and (ii), we redid our calculations using an alternative way
of computing the trend lines. Figure 6 reproduces the basic calculations for three of our TFP
measures using a linear trend that is constructed using data starting in 1985. While there
are some interesting di§erences across the Ögures, they have all share the two key features,

The BLS measure is only available at an annual frequency. We interpolate the annual data to a quarterly
frequency using a standard interpolation routine described in Boot, Feibes, and Lisman (1967).

(i) and (ii), discussed above. SpeciÖcally, it appears that TFP was persistently low during
the Great Recession.30
We now explain why we adopt an unobserved components time series representation of
ln (zt ) : If we assume that agents knew in 2008Q3 that the fall in TFP would turn out to be so
persistent, then our model generates a counterfactual surge in ináation. We infer that agents
only gradually became aware of the persistence in the decline of TFP. The notion that it took
agents time to realize that the drop in TFP was highly persistent is consistent with other
evidence. For example, Figure 4 in Swanson and Williams (2013) shows that professional
forecasts consistently underestimated how long it would take the economy to emerge from
the ZLB.
The previous considerations are the reason that we work with the unobserved components
representation for ln (zt ) in (2.27). In addition, these considerations underlie our prior that the
standard deviation of the transitory shock is substantially larger than the standard deviation
of the permanent shock. We imposed this prior in estimating the model on pre-2008 data.
At this point, it is worth to repeat the observation made in section 4.2 that we have not
assumed anything particularly exotic about technology growth. As noted above, our model
implies that the growth rate of technology is roughly a random walk, in accordance with a
long tradition in business cycle theory. What our analysis in e§ect exploits is that a process
that is as simple as a random walk can have components that are very di§erent from a random
walk.
Our analysis involves simulating the response of the model to shocks. So, we must compute
a sequence of realized values of ln (zt ) : Unlike government spending and interest rate spreads,
we do not directly observe ln (zt ) : In our model log TFP does not coincide with ln (zt ). The
principle reason for this is the presence of the Öxed cost in production in our model. But,
the behavior of model-implied TFP is sensitive to ln (zt ) :
To our initial surprise, the behavior of ináation is also very sensitive to ln (zt ) : So, from
this perspective both ináation and TFP contain substantial information about ln (zt ) : These
observations led us to choose a sequence of realized values for ln (zt ) that, conditional on the
other shocks, allows the model to account reasonably well for ináation and log TFP.
The bottom panel of Figure 5 reports the measure of TFP for our model, computed using a
close variant of the Bureau of Labor Statisticsí procedure.31 The black line with dots displays
the modelís simulated value of TFP relative to trend (how we detrend and solve the model is
30

To assess the robustness of the inference for TFP we adopted the following exercise. First, we computed
the target gap for TFP using the procedure discussed in the main text. Second, we measured TFP using the
BLS time series for the private business sector. Then the solid line with dots in Figure 5 corresponding to
the model implied measure of TFP lies well within the min-max range for TFP target gap.

Our measure of TFP is the ratio of GDP (i.e., C + I + G) to capital and labor services, each raised to a
power that corresponds to their steady state share of total income.

discussed below). Note that model TFP lies within the range of empirical measures reported
in Figure 5. The bottom panel of Figure 6 shows that we obtain the same result when we
detrend our three empirical measures of TFP when using a trend that begins in 19825
Nonlinear versions of the standard Kalman smoothing methods could be used to estimate
the sequence of ln (zt ) in the post 2008Q2 data. In practice, this approach is computationally
challenging and we defer it to future work. For convenience, we assume there was a one-time
shock to ln (zt ) in 2008Q3. For the reasons given above, we assume that the shock was to
the permanent component of ln (zt ) ; i.e., "Pt : We selected a value of %0:4 percent for that
shock so that, in conjunction with our other assumptions, the model does a reasonable job of
accounting for post 2008Q2 ináation and log TFP. This one-time shock leads to a persistent
move in ln (zt ) which eventually puts zt roughly 1:6 percent below the level it would have
been in the absence of the shock. The shock to "Pt also leads to a sequence of one-step-ahead
forecast errors for agents, via (2.33). Our speciÖcation of ln (zt ) captures features (i) and (ii)
of the TFP data that were discussed above.
Government Consumption Shocks
Next we consider the shock to government consumption. The variable . gt deÖned in (2.37)
is computed using the simulated path of neutral technology, ln (zt ) (see (2.38) and (2.39)).32
Then, gt is measured by dividing actual government consumption in Figure 4, by . gt : Agents
forecast the period t value of . gt using current and past realizations of the technology shocks.
We assume that agents forecast gt by using the following AR(2) process:
ln (gt =g) = 1:6 ln (gt!1 =g) % :64 ln (gt!2 =g) + "G
t ;
where "G
t is a mean zero, unit variance iid shock. We chose the roots for the AR(2) process
such that the Örst and second order autocorrelations of 7 ln Gt in our estimated model are
close to the data for the sample 1951Q1 to 2008Q2. We assume that the realized values of
the government consumption target gap, i.e. the shocks to government consumption, equal
the mean data values depicted in the (2,2) element of Figure 7.
5.3. Monetary Policy
We make two key assumptions about monetary policy during the post 2008Q3 period. We
assume that the Fed initially followed a version of the Taylor rule that respects the ZLB
on the nominal interest rate. We assume that there was an unanticipated regime change in
2011Q3, when the Fed switched to a policy of forward guidance.
32
For simplicity, in our calculations we assume that the investment-speciÖc technology shock remains on
its steady state growth path after 2008.

35

5.3.1. Taylor Rule
We now deÖne our version of the Taylor rule that takes the non-negativity constraint on the
nominal interest rate into account. Let Zt denote a gross ëshadowí nominal rate of interest,
which satisÖes the following Taylor-style monetary policy rule:
$
%
A
ln(Zt ) = ln(R) + r= ln ` A
+ 0:25r(y ln Ot =(Ot!4 \A
t =`
O )):

(5.6)

The actual policy rate, Rt ; is determined as follows:

ln (Rt ) = max fln (R=a) ; 'R ln(Zt!1 ) + (1 % 'R ) ln(Zt )g :

(5.7)

In 2008Q2, the federal funds rate was close to two percent (see Figure 4). Consequently,
because of the ZLB, the federal funds rate could only fall by at most two percentage points.
To capture this in our model, we set the scalar a to 1:004825.
Absent the ZLB constraint, the policy rule given by (5.6)-(5.7) coincides with (2.36), the
policy rule that we estimated using pre-2008 data.
5.3.2. Forward Guidance
We interpret forward guidance as a monetary policy that commits to keeping the nominal
interest rate at zero until there is substantial improvement in the state of the economy.
Initially, in 2011Q3 the Fed did not quantify what they meant by ësubstantial improvementí.
Instead, they reported how long they thought it would take until economic conditions would
have improved substantially. In December 2012 the Fed became more explicit about what the
state of the economy would have to be for them to consider leaving the ZLB. In particular,
the Fed said that it would keep the interest rate at zero as long as ináation remains below
2:5 percent and unemployment remains above 6:5 percent. They did not commit to any
particular action in case one or both of the thresholds are breached.
In modeling forward guidance we begin with the period, 2011Q3-2012Q4. We do not
know what the Fedís thresholds were during this period. But, we do know that in 2011Q3,
the Fed announced that it expected the interest rate to remain at zero until mid-2013 (see
Campbell, et al., 2012). According to Swanson and Williams (2013), when the Fed made its
announcement the number of quarters that professional forecasters expected the interest rate
to remain at zero jumped from 4 quarters to 7 or more quarters. We assume that forecasters
believed the Fedís announcement and thought that the nominal interest rate would be zero
for about 8 quarters. Interestingly, Swanson and Williams (2013) also report that forecasters
continued to expect the interest rate to remain at zero for 7 or more quarters in each month
through January 2013. Clearly, forecasters were repeatedly revising upwards their expectation
of how long the ZLB episode would last. To capture this scenario in a parsimonious way we
36

assume that in each quarter, beginning in 2011Q3 and ending in 2012Q4, agents believed the
ZLB would remain in force for another 8 quarters. Thereafter, we suppose that they expected
the Fed to revert back to the Taylor rule, (5.6) and (5.7).33
Beginning in 2013Q1, we suppose that agents believed the Fed switched to an explicit
threshold rule. SpeciÖcally, we assume that agents thought the Fed would keep the Federal
Funds rate close to zero until either the unemployment rate fell below 6:5 percent or ináation
rose above 2:5 percent. We assume that as soon as these thresholds are met, the Fed switches
back to our estimated Taylor rule, (5.6) and (5.7). The latter feature of our rule is an
approximation because, as noted above, the Fed did not announce what it would do when
the thresholds were met.
5.4. Solving the Model
Our speciÖcation of monetary policy includes a non-negativity constraint on the nominal
interest rate, as well as regime switching. A subset of the latter depend on realizations of
endogenous variables. We search for a solution to our model in the space of sequences.34
The solution satisÖes the equilibrium conditions which take the form of a set of stochastic
di§erence equations that are restricted by initial and end-point conditions. Our solution
strategy makes one approximation: certainty equivalence. That is, wherever an expression
like Et f (xt+j ) is encountered, we replace it by f (Et xt+j ) ; for j > 0:
Let yt denote the vector of shocks operating in the post-2008Q2 period:
yt =

$

7bt 7kt zt gt

%0

:

The law of motion and agentsí information sets about yt have been discussed above.
Let %t denote the N 6 1 vector of period t endogenous variables, appropriately scaled to
account for steady growth. We express the equilibrium conditions of the model as follows:
% &
# $
E f %t+1 ; %t ; %t!1 ; yt ; yt+1 j:t = 0:

(5.8)

Here, the information set is given by

8
9
:t = %t!1!j ; yt!j ; j & 0 :

Our solution strategy proceeds as follows. As discussed above, we Öx a sequence of values
for yt for the periods after 2008Q2. We suppose that at date t agents observe yt!s ; s & 0 for
33

Our model of monetary policy is clearly an approximation. For example, it is possible that in our
stochastic simulations the Fedís actual thresholds are breached before 8 quarters. Since we do not know what
those thresholds were, we do not see a way to substantially improve our approach. Later, in December 2013,
the Fed did announce thresholds, but there is no reason to believe that those were their thresholds in the
earlier period.
34
Our procedure is related to the one proposed in Fair and Taylor (1983).

We adopt an analogous notation for %t : In particular, denote the expected value of %t+j

greater than 2008Q3 we set %t!1 = %t!1 : For t corresponding to 2008Q3, we set %t!1 to its
non-stochastic steady state value.
We now discuss how we computed %tt+j ; j & 0: We do so by solving the equilibrium
conditions and imposing certainty equivalence. In particular, %tt must satisfy:

% &
# $
E f %t+1 ; %t ; %t!1 ; yt ; yt+1 j:t
%
$
t
= 0:
' f %tt+1 ; %tt ; %t!1 ; ytt ; yt+1

Evidently, to solve for %tt requires %tt+1 : Relation (5.8) implies:

t
= 0:
; yt+2
' f %tt+2 ; %tt+1 ; %tt ; yt+1

Proceeding in this way, we obtain a sequence of equilibrium conditions involving %tt+j ; j & 0:
Solving for this sequence requires a terminal condition. We obtain this condition by imposing
that %tt+j converges to the non-stochastic steady state value of %t : With this procedure it is
straightforward to implement our assumptions about monetary policy.

6. The Great Recession: Empirical Results
In this section we analyze the behavior of the economy from 2008Q3 to the end of our sample,
2013Q2. First, we investigate how well our model accounts for the data. Second, we use our
model to assess which shocks account for the Great Recession. In addition, we also investigate
the role of the risky working capital channel, the ZLB, forward guidance and the labor force
participation rate.
6.1. The Modelís Implications for the Great Recession
Figure 8 displays our empirical characterization of the Great Recession, i.e., the di§erence
between how the economy would have evolved absent the post 2008Q2 shocks and how it
did evolve. In addition, we display the relevant model analogs. For this, we assume that the
economy would have been on its steady state growth path in the absence of the post-2008Q2
shocks. This is an approximation that simpliÖes the analysis and is arguably justiÖed by the
fact that the volatility of the economy is much greater after 2008 than it was before. The
38

model analog to our empirical characterization of the Great Recession is the log di§erence
between the variables on the steady state growth path and their response to the post-2008Q2
shocks.
Figure 8 indicates that the model does quite well at accounting for the behavior of our
11 endogenous variables during the Great Recession. Notice in particular that the model
is roughly consistent with the modest decline in real wages despite the absence of nominal
rigidities in wage setting. Also, notice that the model accounts reasonably well for the
average level of ináation despite the fact that our model incorporates only a moderate degree
of price stickiness: Örms change prices on average once a year. In addition, the model also
accounts well for the key labor market variables: labor force participation, employment,
unemployment, vacancies and the job Önding rate.
Figure 9 provides another way to assess the modelís implications for vacancies and unemployment. There, we report a scatter plot with vacancies on the vertical axis and unemployment on the horizontal axis. The model variables in Figure 9 are taken from the (2,1) and
(4,1) panels of Figure 8. The data correspond to the target gap in the gray area of Figure 8
generated by using a linear trend starting in 2001, the start of the recession prior to the Great
Recession. Although the variables are expressed in deviations from trend, the resulting Beveridge curve has the same key features as those in the raw data (see, for example, Diamond
2010, Figure 4). In particular, notice how actual vacancies fall and unemployment rises from
late 2008 to late 2009. This downward relationship is referred to as the Beveridge curve. After
2009, vacancies rise but unemployment falls by less than one would have predicted based on
the Beveridge curve that existed before 2009. That is, it appears that after 2009 there was a
shift up in the Beveridge curve. This shift is often interpreted as reáecting a deterioration in
match e¢ciency, captured in a simple environment like ours by a fall in the parameter governing productivity in the matching function (see ] m in (2.41)). This interpretation reáects
a view that models like ours imply a stable downward relationship between vacancies and
unemployment, which can only be perturbed by a change in match e¢ciency. However, this
downward relationship is in practice derived as a steady state property of models, and is in
fact not appropriate for interpreting quarterly data. To explain this, we consider a simple
example.35
Suppose that the matching function is given by:
ht = ] m;t Vt1 Ut1!1 ; 0 < Z < 1;
where ht ; Vt and Ut denote hires, vacancies and unemployment, respectively. Also, ] m;t
denotes a productivity parameter that can potentially capture variations in match e¢ciency.
Dividing the matching function by the number of unemployed, we obtain the job Önding rate
35

We include this example for completeness. It can be found in other places, for example, Yashiv (2008).

39

ft - ht =Ut ; so that:

ft = ] m;t (Vt =Ut )1 :

The simplest search and matching model assumes that the labor force is constant so that:
1 = lt + Ut ;
where lt denotes employment and the labor force is assumed to be of size unity. The change
in the number of people unemployed is given by:
Ut+1 % Ut = (1 % ') lt % ft Ut ;
where (1 % ') lt denotes the employed workers that separate into unemployment in period t
and ft Ut is the number of unemployed workers who Önd jobs. In steady state, Ut+1 = Ut ; so
that:
Ut = (1 % ') = (ft + 1 % ') :
Combining this expression with the deÖnition of the Önding rate and solving for Vt ; we obtain:
/1
(1 % ') (1 % Ut ) (
Vt =
:
(6.1)
] m;t Ut1!1
This equation clearly implies (i) a negative relationship between Ut and Vt and (ii) the only
way that relationship can shift is with a change in the value of ] m;t or in the value of the other
matching function parameter, Z.36 Results (i) and (ii) are apparently very robust, as they
do not require taking a stand on many key relations in the overall economy. In the technical
appendix, we derive a similar result for our model, which also does not depend on most of
our model details, such as the costs for arranging meetings between workers and Örms, the
determination of the value of a job, etc.
While the steady state Beveridge curve described in the previous paragraph may be useful
for many purposes, it is misleading for interpreting data from the Great Recession, when the
steady state condition, Ut+1 % Ut ; is far from being satisÖed.
If we donít impose the steady state condition Ut+1 = Ut ; we obtain the following relationship between Vt and Ut :
/1=1
(1 % Ut )
Ut+1 % Ut
%
(6.2)
Vt = (1 % ')
] m;t Ut1!1
] m;t Ut1!1
During severe recessions, the steady state condition, Ut+1 = Ut ; will not be satisÖed. The
variable Ut+1 % Ut is a large positive number in the downturn of a severe recession, and then
36

In principle, a change in the separation rate, 1 % 1; could also have shifted the Beveridge curve during the
Great Recession. This explanation does not work because the separation rate fell from an average level of 3.7
percent before the Great Recession to an average of 3.1 percent after 2009. These numbers were calculated
using JOLTS data available at the BLS website.

40

becomes negative as the economy recovers. This e§ect can easily generate what looks like a
shift in the ëstandardí Beveridge curve.
Figure 9 shows that our model accounts for the so-called shift in the Beveridge curve,
even though the productivity parameter in our matching function is constant.37 The only
di§erence between the analysis in Figure 9 and our modelís steady state Beveridge curve is
that we do not impose the Ut+1 % Ut = 0 condition. Thus, according to our analysis the
data on vacancies and unemployment present no reason to suppose that there has been a
deterioration in match e¢ciency. There may have been such a deterioration to some extent,
but it does not seem to be a Örst order feature of the Great Recession.
Below we show that the most important shock driving the real side of the economy into
the Great Recession was the Önancial wedge. It follows that shocks to that wedge were the
key drivers of variations in Ut+1 % Ut and the apparent shift in the Beveridge curve.
6.2. The Causes of the Great Recession
Figures 10 through 14 decompose the impact of the di§erent shocks and the risky working
capital channel on the economy in the post 2008Q3 period. We determine the role of a shock
by setting that shock to its steady state value and redoing the simulations underlying Figure
8. The resulting decomposition is not additive because of the nonlinearities in the model.
E§ects of Neutral Technology
Figure 10 displays the e§ect of the neutral technology shock on the post-2008 simulation.
For convenience, the solid line reproduces the corresponding solid line in Figure 8. The dashed
line displays the behavior of the economy when neutral technology shock is shut down (i.e.,
"pt = 0 in 2008Q3). Comparing the solid and dashed lines, we see that the neutral technology
slowdown had a signiÖcant impact on ináation that arises from its e§ect on marginal costs.
Had it not been for the decline in neutral technology, there would have been substantial
deáation, as predicted by very simple NK models that do not allow for a drop in technology
during the ZLB period. Also note that according to the model the negative technology shock
pushed output, investment, and consumption down. At the same time that shock led to
an increase in employment and the labor force. The latter e§ect reáects that according to
our estimated model agents perceive technology shocks to be transitory. See CTW for the
intuition underlying the result that employment and output move in opposite direction in
response to transitory neutral technology shocks.
E§ects of Risky Working Capital Channel
37

Eichenbaum (2014) shows that the simple model above as summarized by (6.2) also captures the key
features of the Beveridge curve over the Great Recession.

41

Medium-sized DSGE models typically abstract from the risky working capital channel. A
natural question is: how important is that channel in allowing our model to account for the
moderate degree of ináation during the Great Recession? To answer that question, we redo
the simulation underlying Figure 8, replacing (5.5) with (2.16). The results are displayed in
Figure 11. We Önd that the risky working capital channel plays an important role in allowing
the model to account for the moderate decline in ináation that occurred during the Great
Recession. In the presence of a risky working capital requirement, a higher interest rate due
to a positive Önancial wedge shock directly raises Örmsí marginal cost. Other things equal,
this rise leads to ináation. Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim and Zakrajöek (2013) provide Örm-level
evidence consistent with the importance of our risky working capital channel. They Önd that
Örms with bad balance sheets raise prices relative to Örms with good balance sheets. From
our perspective, Örms with bad balance sheets face a very high cost of working capital and
therefore, high marginal costs.
While the risky working capital channel has a signiÖcant impact on ináation, it has essentially no e§ect on real quantities. The reason is as follows. Recall that agents forecast the
corporate bond spread using an AR(1) process with an AR coe¢cient of 0:5. So they think
that the rise in spreads is very transitory as well as any ináation stemming from this channel.
It follows, that agents think that change in the real interest rate associated with the change
in the corporate spread is not long lasting. But changes in consumption demand depend on
the change in the long-term real interest rate. That rate is not much a§ected by transitory
changes in the short-term real interest rate.38 The previous argument makes clear that our
analysis of the e§ect of the risky working capital channel depends on our assumption that
agents expected the ZLB episode to be relatively short-lived (see Swanson and Williams 2013
for evidence on this point).
Taken together, the negative technology shocks and the risky working capital channel explain the relatively modest disináation that occurred during the Great Recession. Essentially
they exerted countervailing pressure on the disináationary forces that were operative during
the Great Recession.
E§ects of Financial and Consumption Wedges
Figures 12 and 13 report the e§ects of the Önancial and consumption wedges, respectively.
The Önancial wedge is clearly the most important shock in terms of driving the economy into
the ZLB and in terms of accounting for the drop in economic activity and ináation after 2008.
The fact that the nominal interest rate remains at zero after 2011 when there is no Önancial
wedge reáects our speciÖcation of monetary policy. Notice that the model attributes the
38

If we increase the AR coe¢cient that agents use to forecast the corporate bond spread, then we obtain
larger e§ects of the risky working capital channel on real quantities in Figure 11.

42

substantial drop in the labor force participation rate mostly due to the Önancial wedge. The
consumption wedge drives down the labor force participation rate to a lesser extent than the
Önancial wedge. The rationale for the e§ects of the wedges is straightforward. Both wedges
lead to deteriorations in labor market conditions: drops in the job vacancy and Önding rates
and in the real wage. We do not think these wedge shocks were important in the pre-2008
period. In this way, the model is consistent with the fact that labor force participation rates
are not very cyclical during normal recessions, while being very cyclical during the Great
Recession.39
A natural question is: what features of our model accounts for the persistence of the Great
Recession? The answer is: the persistence of the Önancial and consumption wedges. Suppose
we set the wedges to zero starting in 2010Q1, then the unemployment rate would have been
5.5% by early 2012. Most of this e§ect stems from setting the Önancial wedge to zero.
E§ects of Government Consumption and the ZLB
We now turn to Figure 14, which analyzes the role of government consumption in the Great
Recession. Government consumption passes through two phases (see Figure 7). The Örst
phase corresponds to the expansion associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009. The second phase involves a contraction that began at the start of 2011. The
Örst phase involves a maximum rise of 2:75 percent in government consumption (i.e., 0:55
percent relative to steady state GDP) and a maximum rise of about 0:9 percent in GDP. This
implies a maximum government consumption multiplier of 0:9=0:55 or 1:6.40 In the second
phase the decline in government spending is much more substantial, falling a maximum of
about 10 percent, or 2 percent relative to steady state GDP. At the same time, the resulting
drop in GDP is about 1:8 percent (see Figure 14). So, in the second phase, the government
spending multiplier is only 1:8=2 or 0:9. In light of this result, it is di¢cult to attribute the
long duration of the Great Recession to the recent decline in government consumption.
The second phase Öndings may at Örst seem inconsistent with existing analyses, which
suggest that the government consumption multiplier may be very large in the ZLB. Indeed,
Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011) show that a rise in government consumption that
is expected to not extend beyond the ZLB has a large multiplier e§ect. But, they also show
that a rise in government consumption that is expected to extend beyond the ZLB has a
relatively small multiplier e§ect. The intuition for this is straightforward. An increase in
spending after the ZLB ceases to bind has no direct impact on spending in the ZLB. But, it
39

See Erceg and Levin (2013), for an analysis which reaches a qualitatively similar conclusion using a small
scale, calibrated model.
40
Christiano, Eichenbaum and Trabandt (2014) provide some evidence that our conclusions for the multiplier are robust to allowing for distortionary labor income taxes and no lump-sum taxes.

43

has a negative impact on household consumption in the ZLB because of the negative wealth
e§ects associated with the (lump-sum) taxes required to Önance the increase in government
spending. A feature of our simulations is that the increase in government consumption in the
Örst phase is never expected by agents to persist beyond the ZLB. In the second phase the
decrease in government consumption is expected to persist beyond the end of the ZLB.
Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011) also argue that the size of the multiplier
depends on how binding the ZLB is. By binding we mean how low the nominal interest
would be if we ignored the ZLB. Figure 15 displays the e§ects of ignoring the ZLB in our
modelís predictions for the Great Recession.41 Two things are worth noting. First, the ZLB
was much more binding at the stage when government consumption was rising. This fact
helps explain why the multiplier associated with the increase in government consumption is
higher than the one associated with the decrease. Second, the output e§ects stemming from
the ZLB are generally modest. Put di§erently, the model attributes most of the magnitude
and persistence of the Great Recession to the wedges and the slowdown in the growth rate
of TFP. Of course absent nominal rigidities, the e§ects of the shocks would be very di§erent.
For example, it is well known that it is very hard to obtain comovement of consumption and
investment in a real business cycle model that does not allow for nominal rigidities.
E§ects of Forward Guidance
Figure 16 displays the impact of the monetary policy regime switch to forward guidance
in 2011. The dashed line represents the model simulation with all shocks, when the Taylor
rule is in place throughout the period. The Ögure indicates that without forward guidance
the Fed would have started raising the interest rate in early 2014. By keeping the interest
rate at zero, the monetary authority caused output to be about two percent higher and the
unemployment rate to be about one percentage point lower. Interestingly, this relationship
is consistent with Okunís law.
E§ects of Labor Force Participation
One of the key contribution of our paper is to endogenize the labor force participation
rate. A natural question is to what extent the prolonged fall in the labor force participation
rate contributed to the decline in overall economic activity. Figure 17 displays the modelís
predictions for how the economy would have evolved post-2008 if we hold the labor force
participation rate constant. Clearly, the decline in employment, consumption and output
that occurred during the Great Recession would have been substantially smaller.
41

Since we ignore the ZLB here, we also shut down forward guidance in this decomposition.

7. Conclusion
This paper argues that the bulk of movements in aggregate real economic activity during the
Great Recession were due to Önancial frictions. We reach this conclusion by looking at the
data through the lens of an estimated New Keynesian model in which Örms face moderate
degrees of price rigidities, no nominal rigidities in wages and a ZLB constraint that started
to bind in early 2009. Our model does a good job of accounting for the joint behavior of
labor and goods markets, as well as ináation, during the Great Recession. According to the
model the observed fall in TFP relative to trend and the rise in the cost of working capital
played key roles in accounting for the small drop in ináation that occurred during the Great
Recession.

Notes: Transition probabilities between employment (E), unemployment (U) and
non-participation (N). Model refers to transition probabilities in steady state at
estimated parameter values. Data are based on Current Population Survey. We
take the average of monthly transition probabilities from January 1990 to December
2013. To convert from monthly to quarterly frequency we take the average monthly
transition probability matrix to the power of three.
