International Transmissions of Monetary Shocks: Between a Trilemma and a Dilemma

NBER Working Paper No. 22812
November 2016
JEL No. F3
ABSTRACT
This paper re-examines international transmissions of monetary policy shocks from advanced
economies to emerging market economies. In terms of methodologies, it combines three novel
features. First, it separates co-movement in monetary policies due to common shocks from
spillovers of monetary policies from advanced to peripheral economies. Second, it uses surprises
in growth and inflation and the Taylor rule to gauge desired changes in a country’s interest rate if
it is to focus exclusively on growth, inflation, and real exchange rate stability. Third, it proposes a
specification that can work with the quantitative easing episodes when no changes in US interest
rate are observed. In terms of empirical findings, we differ from the existing literature and
document patterns of “2.5-lemma” or something between a trilemma and a dilemma: without
capital controls, a flexible exchange rate regime offers some monetary policy autonomy when the
center country tightens its monetary policy, yet it fails to do so when the center country lowers its
interest rate. Capital controls help to insulate periphery countries from monetary policy shocks
from the center country even when the latter lowers its interest rate.

1. Introduction
In an inter-connected world, foreign monetary shocks are often a key risk for emerging
market economies and other developing countries. This paper re-examines the roles of the
nominal exchange rate regime and capital flow management in a country’s resilience to
foreign monetary shocks. There is no shortage of recent reminders of foreign monetary
shocks. When the US Federal Reserve raised the interest rate multiple times in the early
2000s, when it rolled out quantitative easing (QE) after the onset of the Global Financial
Crisis (GFC), when it talked about “tapering” in May 2013, when the increase in the US
interest rate actually took place in December 2015, when the market revised downward
expectations in March 2016 about the number of US interest rate increases that might
happen in 2016, and when the Fed further postponed another rate increase in June and
August of 2016, we saw each time that international capital flows to emerging markets
reacted and interest rates in many developing countries also appeared to have reacted –
often (but not always) to follow the actual or anticipated changes in US interest rates.
What does it take for a country to have some buffer against foreign monetary shocks?
The literature is somewhat split on this topic. The textbook notion that a flexible exchange
rate regime provides insulation against foreign shocks is said to be supported by the data in
Edwards (2012), Klein and Shambaugh (2015), and Obstfeld (2015), among others. On the
other hand, using equity prices for firms across emerging market economies, Tong and Wei
(2011) find that, in terms of the extent to which an emerging market economy was affected
by the GFC, a flexible nominal exchange rate by itself does not provide much help but
capital flow management encouraging more FDI and less non-FDI type of capital flows
before the GFC tends to provide some cushion during the GFC. In terms of pair-wise
correlations among cross-border capital flows, Rey (2015) points out that whether a country
has a flexible or a fixed nominal exchange rate regime does not seem to make a difference,
but whether it has capital controls does. The findings of the last two papers are consistent
with each other. Rey’s (2015) title, “dilemma not trilemma,” succinctly highlights a view
that capital controls appear necessary (whereas a flexible exchange rate regime is not) for a
country to be insulated from global financial cycles. Interestingly, neither Tong and Wei
(2011) nor Rey (2015) directly examine how combinations of nominal exchange rate regimes

3

and capital controls affect a country’s conduct of monetary policy in relation to foreign
monetary shocks.
In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of different combinations of exchange rate
regimes and capital control measures, and we pay special attention to accounting for
possible correlations in monetary policies due to common shocks. We will report evidence of
“2.5-lemma” or something between a trilemma and a dilemma: a flexible exchange rate
regime appears to convey monetary policy autonomy to peripheral countries when the
center country raises its interest rate, but does not do so when the center lowers its interest
rate. In other words, “fear of floating” mostly takes the form of “fear of appreciation.”
Capital controls provide insulation to peripheral countries from foreign monetary policy
shocks even when the center lowers its interest rate. The “2.5-lemma” pattern is more
nuanced than the findings in the existing literature.
The paper makes a number of methodological innovations. First, we use an estimated
surprise component of the inflation forecast and an estimated surprise component of the
growth forecast together with the Taylor rule specification to capture the desired change in
a peripheral country’s monetary policy based on a country’s own domestic needs. The
Taylor specification includes the stability of real exchange rates as a goal of domestic
monetary policy, in addition to output and price stabilization, as suggested by Engle (2011).
Such a framework allows us to control for possible coincidental co-movement of a country’s
monetary policy with that of the United States (US). In other words, sometimes the
domestic needs of two different central banks may coincide such that their chosen monetary
policies are similar even when there is no policy spillover. Hence, not all co-movements of
interest rates in the peripheral and center countries would be interpreted as transmission
of monetary policies or lack of monetary policy autonomy.
Second, the paper provides a specification and an estimation method that can include
the QE episodes, when we do not observe much change in the US interest rate. We use a
likelihood function to incorporate the latent (but censored) changes in the US policy rate.
When the US interest rate is above the lower bound, changes in US monetary policy stance
can be directly observed from the changes in its interest rate. When the US interest rate is
at or near the lower bound, on the other hand, changes in the US policy stance are inferred
from changes in the US money supply relative to its aggregate output. Instead of using a

4

pre-estimated “shadow rate” for the zero-lower-bound period, as done by Wu and Xia (2016)
and Krippner (2014), we estimate the parameters jointly with the equation on international
transmission of monetary shocks3. To our best knowledge, this is among the first attempts
in the literature to incorporate the lower-bound episodes in a study of international
monetary policy transmissions.
There are important precursors to this paper in the literature. Obstfeld (2015) examines
the role of the nominal exchange rate regime but does not explicitly examine the role of
capital controls in the international transmission of monetary policy shocks. Since many
countries with a flexible nominal exchange rate regime also maintain capital flow
management, what appears to be the effect of a flexible exchange rate could instead be the
effect of capital controls. Han and Wei (2014) and Klein and Shambaugh (2015) look at both
but do not fully account for common shocks that can give the appearance of lack of policy
independence of the peripheral country. They also reach opposite conclusions. While Han
and Wei (2014) find that a flexible exchange rate by itself does not confer monetary policy
autonomy, Klein and Shambaugh (2015) find that a moderately flexible exchange rate does
but partial capital controls do not. Aizenman et al. (2016) introduced both exchange rate
stability and financial openness in analyzing the sensitivity of peripheral countries’ policy
rates to core countries’ monetary policies. They found that economies that pursue greater
exchange rate stability and financial openness face stronger links with center economies,
which is consistent with our conclusion. However, they introduced exchange rate stability
and financial openness separately and not as a policy combination. In our specification, a
policy regime is jointly determined by a combination of capital controls and a nominal
exchange rate regime.
The paper also differs from the previous papers by explicitly allowing for asymmetric
responses by peripheral countries on a flexible exchange rate regime to central country
interest rate changes. That is, peripheral countries may or may not feel equally compelled
to follow the center country’s policy moves depending on whether the center loosens or
tightens its monetary policy. In addition, this paper is the first to use estimated surprise
components in GDP growth and inflation forecasts in gauging domestic policy need and the

directly instead of estimating the shadow rates and other parameters jointly.

5

first in incorporating the quantitative easing episode in the context of international
monetary policy transmission.
Farhi and Werning (2014) use a New Keynesian model to study whether capital controls
are needed for welfare maximization when a country already has a flexible exchange rate.
They found that the answer is yes: even with a flexible exchange rate regime, capital
controls raise welfare. In their framework, capital controls are introduced as “taxes” over
capital inflows during capital inflow surges caused by negative risk premium shocks and as
“subsidies” to capital outflows when the capital flows revert. That is, capital controls work
in an opposite way of risk premium shocks. When social welfare is affected by both terms of
trade and the intertemporal path of consumption, it is generally useful to employ both tools.
With a flexible exchange rate to influence terms of trade and capital controls to influence
intertemporal consumption, social welfare is higher than just using one of the tools. This
theoretical result is consistent with the “2.5-lemma” pattern we will report. That is, when
the center country loosens its monetary policy (which tends to generate a capital flow surge
into other countries), peripheral countries appear to feel compelled to follow suit by
lowering their interest rates, unless they have capital control measures in place.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 sets up the modeling specification and
introduces the data; Section 3 presents the empirical estimation results; Section 4 extends
the analysis by proposing a method to include more recent episodes in which US interest
rates may reach the zero lower bound; Section 5 reports additional robustness checks;
finally, Section 6 concludes.
2. Specification and Data

2.1 Empirical model
Our baseline specification is built on two steps. The first step describes the relationship
between the monetary policy of a periphery country and that of a center country, which we
assume is the United States, conditional on other determinants of the periphery’s monetary
policy. Let Δ��, , denote the changes in policy interest rate of (peripheral) country � in time

. We assume it depends on four factors: the value of the policy rate one period ago, ��,

−

change in the desired policy rate, Δ��, ∗ , driven solely by domestic factors; a change in the

;a

6

interest rate driven by the center country, Δ�

�

; and a global financial cycle factor, which

we approximate by the percentage changes of the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market
Volatility Index, Δ�� . More precisely,
(1) Δ��, = ���,

−

Δ��, ∗ +

The lagged policy rate, ��,

+ Δ��

+ ε�, .

, could capture policy momentum or a notion of policy space. For

example, a higher lagged policy rate allows more space for downward policy changes. We
expect to have a negative estimate of the coefficient, �.

When country i’s interest rate is observed to have changed alongside with that of the

United States, is it lack of monetary policy independence or coincidence of a common shock?
To separate the two, we have to specify the desired change in country i’s policy rate that is
driven solely by its domestic need, Δ��, ∗ . We do this by a combination of the Taylor rule and

the estimated surprise components in growth and inflation forecasts. In other words, Δ��, ∗ is
assumed to be driven by news about the domestic output gap and the inflation gap.

However, different from Obstfeld (2015) and Han and Wei (2014), we use the revisions in
semi-annual forecasts of GDP and CPI by the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) to
represent the surprise components in the output gap and the inflation gap. Economic theory
tells us to expect positive coefficients on both factors.
Since domestic factors are not our focus in this study, in our baseline analysis, we do not
differentiate the weights on the output surprise and the inflation surprise across countries.
∗

Let ��, be the desired monetary policy rate of country �; then Δ��, ∗ is the desired change in
the policy rate since the previous period. The least squares regression model of the Taylor

are revisions to the projections of GDP growth and inflation rates by the IMF

between its two projection horizons. The IMF releases its projections (typically) twice a
year, in early April and September (sometimes October), respectively. For each country, the
projections are done by desk economists in the Fund, with the overall coordination by its

7

Research Department to ensure global consistency. The projections presumably take into
account all available information to the Fund and the best judgments of the relevant Fund
staff at the time of making the projections. Our maintained assumption is that the IMF
projections of a member country’s growth and inflation are unbiased estimates of the
member central bank’s projections. Due to IMF’s privileged access to member countries’
central banks and information and the caliber of its staff, such an assumption seems
reasonable. It is also useful to note that IMF projections of growth and inflation are
formally made conditional on the government’s existing macroeconomic policies. That’s why
the projections are called projections rather than forecasts.4 One (helpful) consequence of
the IMF methodology is that we do not need to worry about potentially endogenous
responses of inflation and growth to anticipated changes in the interest rate.
In addition to inflation and output gaps, Engel (2011) included exchange rate
misalignment into the loss function of policy makers and showed that exchange rate
misalignments affect welfare. In our framework, instead of introducing the exchange rate
arrangement into the Taylor rule, we allow the exchange rate to interact with capital
controls and then to differentiate the spillover from the monetary policy of the core country
(the United States). In other words, the role the exchange rate regime plays depends on the
capital control and exchange rate arrangements.
Since our purpose is to find out which combinations of capital control regimes and
nominal exchange rate systems can provide monetary policy independence, we make

as “that established policies of national authorities will be maintained.”

With this specification,5 we can compare different

coefficients directly and easily.

According to Obstfeld (2015), Rey (2015), and Bruno and Shin (2015), global financial
cycles may affect a country’s monetary policy stance separate from transmissions of
monetary policies from the center to periphery countries. Following these authors, we
introduce Δ�� —the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options, which is a common
measure of global financial uncertainty—into our model. Lower values of Δ��

are often

interpreted as higher global risk appetite or greater tolerance of risk-taking.

We are going to use equation (4) to test our hypothesis. As listed in Table 1, the
baseline combination is the fixed exchange rate regime without capital controls. We
interpret coefficient

as a measure of spillover from a change in the US policy rate to the

interest rate in an economy with a combination of a fixed exchange rate regime and no
capital controls. If one wishes to interpret the trilemma hypothesis narrowly, one would
expect

=1 or at least

>0. That is, there is no monetary policy autonomy for any

economy with a fixed nominal exchange rate system and no capital controls. Common
interpretations of the trilemma hypothesis often go beyond this. In particular, one expects
that a flexible exchange rate system would confer monetary autonomy:

=

=0.

If capital controls are not effective because they are “leaky,” we would observe

>0.

On the other hand, if capital controls are completely effective in conferring monetary policy
autonomy, we would expect

=

= 0. On the other hand, if capital controls are partially

effectively (but a flexible exchange rate system is not effective on its own), we may observe
that

>

> 0, and

>

> 0. In other words, by checking for the signs and relative

magnitudes of different s, we can find out whether a given policy regime (a combination of

nominal exchange rate regime and capital control regime) provides no, partial, or complete
monetary policy autonomy.

We extend the baseline specification to incorporate the stability of real exchange rate as

Real exchange rate is nominal exchange rate (in units of local currency per US
dollar) adjusted by the differential in inflation rates between the country in question and
the United States. Therefore, an increase in the value of real exchange rate means
depreciation of local currency; if the country wishes to reduce RER instability, we expect

In equation (6), we allow economies with flexible exchange rate regime to respond

that the countries are reluctant to follow tightening monetary policy by the United States
but generally would follow a reduction in the interest rate by the United States. This would
be interpreted as evidence of “fear of appreciation.” For countries with capital controls (and

still a flexible exchange rate), if there is no spillover in monetary policies regardless of a
rise or fall of the US interest rate, we expect

2.2 Data

,

We include all economies with relevant data in our sample (60 countries in total), of
which 24 are developing or emerging market countries. They are listed in Appendix Table
A1. In our baseline analysis, we include Germany to represent euro currency countries and
exclude all other euro currency countries since they have the same monetary policy as
Germany. We further exclude countries pegged with the euro (post–1999) or pegged with
the German mark (pre–1999). The resulting dataset includes 28 countries6 (excluding the
US) and 827 observations. As a robustness check, we did bring euro zone economies back in
Section 5 to make our results comparable to the existing literature (such as Obstfeld, 2015).
From IMF’s IFS dataset, we collected short-term interest rates – monthly policy rate
data covering M1 1990 to M6 2014. If the monthly policy rate is not available, we use the
discount rate. A detailed description can be found in Appendix Table A2. The policy rates
are used to construct changes in policy rate, Δ��, . Based on equation (4) we also examine the

long-term interest rates’ response to US long-term interest rate changes. For this purpose,

we use 10-year government bond yields. Among the 28 countries included in the short-term
policy rate analysis, Argentina, Belarus, and Ecuador do not have appropriate long-term
government bond yields data and therefore are not included in the long-term rate analysis.
In Table A2, we list the details of the data sources and period coverage of government bond
yields.
To incorporate the effects of domestic factors, as shown in equation (4), we need two
variables – changes in GDP growth and changes in inflation. To get more “exogenous”
changes in GDP growth and changes in inflation, instead of using the first-order difference
of GDP growth and inflation, we use the IMF’s WEO forecasts and the revisions in their
forecasts of GDP growth and inflation. WEO’s forecast data starts from 1990. Each year,
WEO has two publications: one in April and the other in September (for some years, the

11

second issue was released in October). For the forecast of each year, we use two revisions.
For example, for the forecast of GDP (output) growth for year 2000, we use the forecasts
published in WEO in October 1999, April 2000, and September 2000 to calculate two
changes (revisions).7 The same rules apply to the changes in inflation calculations. The lefthand side policy rate changes Δ��, and the changes in US policy rate are calculated as the

difference of monthly policy rates between the two adjacent WEO publication months.

We use the IMF de facto exchange rate regime classification by Ilzetzki et al. (2011)
to define fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes. Classification 18 is defined as fixed
exchange rate. The remaining categories 2–69 are defined as flexible exchange rate.
Countries that were pegged with the German mark or euro were re-defined as flexible
exchange rate since we solely focus on US monetary policy shocks in this analysis. The
detailed descriptions drawn from Ilzetzki et al. (2011) can be found in Table A3 in the
Appendix.10 An alternative regime classification by the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) is used in the robustness check
analysis. It starts from 1999. We label countries in categories 1–3 (pre-2008) and 1–4 (post2008) as the ones with a fixed exchange rate regime. Detailed descriptions can be found in
Table A4 in the Appendix.
While the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was classified under a flexible exchange
rate regime (category 3) from 2002 to 2009 in the IMF de facto regime classification, (as
shown in Table 2), it is classified as fixed during 2002–2005 and flexible during 2006–2007
by AREAER. We will use the alternative classification as a robustness check. As it turns
out, our main inferences are not affected by this change in classification. The index of

category 3 includes pre-announced crawling bands that are wider than or equal to +/–2%, de facto crawling
bands that are narrower than or equal to +/–5%, moving bands that are narrower than or equal to +/–2% (i.e.,
that which allow for both appreciation and depreciation over time), and managed floating; category 4 includes
freely floating; category 5 is “freely falling” (typically with hyperinflation); and category 6 is dual market in
which parallel market data is missing.
10 We further revise the classification for Hong Kong, China. In the Ilzetzki et al. (2011) classification, from
1974 to 1997, it was defined as category 3. However, the Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the US dollar
since 1983. Therefore, in our dataset, we classify it as fixed exchange rate regime.

capital controls is defined as 1–Chinn and Ito’s (2008) financial openness index. In the
baseline estimation, we focus on two discrete cases: no capital controls, and with at least
some capital controls.
The nominal exchange rates and the money supply variables (M1 and M2) are from
IMF’s International Financial Statistics. The aggregated real GDP of the US from CEIC
(Bureau of Economic Analysis) is used to calculate implied interest rate for the zero-bound
periods.
Since the policy rate in the US reached zero bound since September 2009, our baseline
analysis is from May 1990 to April 2009. In Section 4, we will introduce a method to cover
the period when the US interest rate is nearly zero.
3. Analysis
We start our analysis with the short-term policy rate as the focus. Before running the
regression, we first examine the effectiveness of capital controls and exchange rate regimes
by checking the associations of domestic policy rate changes and US policy rate changes.
We classify all countries within a 2x2 matrix, depending on whether they have a flexible or
a fixed exchange rate regime, and whether they have capital controls or not. We illustrate
the relationship between the degree of monetary policy dependence and the features of the
“regime” by a scatter plot (Figure 1): changes in domestic policy rate (vertical axis) are
plotted against changes in US policy rate (horizontal axis). To reduce noise, we first
grouped observations in each regime into twenty groups evenly and took the group average.
Therefore, for each regime, we have twenty observations. Based on these constructed
observations, a linear regression line was fitted, as shown by the solid red line; the 90%
confidence interval is represented by the dashed red lines. The fitted regression lines for
regimes without capital control are significantly positive whereas those for regimes with
capital controls are not.
To test the hypothesis systematically, we turn to a regression analysis based on
equation (4) and report the baseline estimation in Table 3.
As presented in column 1 of Table 3, consistent with our expectation, the coefficient
estimate of λ for the lagged policy rate (–0.048) is negative and statistically significant at

13

10%. This implies that there is a stabilizing tendency for policy rate adjustments. With a
higher lagged policy rate per se, the policy maker tends to adjust the current policy lower.
The coefficient estimate for Δ��� �

ℎ�, is 0.096, but with no statistically significant

difference from zero. The coefficient estimate for Δ�

�� �

�,

is 0.329, statistically

significant at 10%. These estimates are different from the classic Taylor rule parameters for
output gap and inflation gap.11 However, selected recent empirical findings with various
Taylor rule-derived formulas provide comparable estimates. For example, Boivin and
Giannoni (2006) estimate a forward-looking Taylor rule with two lagged policy rates as
additional explanatory variables to formulate US monetary policy. Their estimate for
output gap is 0.000 for both the pre–1979 and post–1979 periods and their estimate for
inflation gap is 0.276 for pre–1979 and 0.508 for post–1979. Comparable estimates were
also found in Kawai and Liu (2015) for the PRC and Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011) for
selected years in the US. Engel (2011) argues that when there are currency
misalignments,12 the optimal monetary policy trades off targeting misalignments with
inflation and output goals, under which the resulting Taylor rule relates the nominal
interest rate in each country only to the CPI inflation in that country, the efficient real
interest rate, and markup shocks. The absence of output gap in this optimal monetary
policy partially justifies the coefficient estimate of 0.096 for ���� �

casts some doubt on the notion that a flexible exchange rate can provide monetary policy
independence. Instead, our findings suggest that countries adopting a flexible exchange

, one could say that the

dependence of monetary policy on the US in this regime is somewhat milder than if the
country also has a fixed exchange rate regime but still without capital controls.
In other words, a mere flexible exchange rate regime does not confer monetary policy
autonomy. Some forms of capital control appear to provide some buffer. Judging from the
point estimates, a combination of capital controls and a flexible exchange rate regime yields
the estimates closest to zero across all specifications and may provide the most autonomy.
Since year 1999 is the starting year of the euro zone (also the middle point of our
sample), we examine whether the start of the euro zone has changed the power of our model
by splitting the sample into two subsamples: 1990–1998 and 1999–2009. As shown in
columns (2) and (3) of Table 3, none of the coefficients for the period 1990–1998 are
significant. The adjusted R-squared is 0.000. On the contrary, the coefficients for the period
1999–2009 (column 3) show similarity with that of the whole sample (column 1). The
adjusted R-squared is 0.30. The difference between the periods 1990–1998 and 1999–2009
implies that the resilience of monetary policy to international monetary policy shocks gets
weaker from 1990–1998 to 1999–2009 (significant positive coefficient estimates for the
regimes of fixed exchange rate without capital controls and flexible exchange rate without
capital controls), which is consistent with the common observation of higher integration of
global capital markets (see, for example, Rey (2015)). The extensions and robustness check
in the following analysis are thus based on the period 1999–2009. In column (4), we present
the estimation results after excluding one outlier (Argentina in April 2001).13 The results
still hold except for the coefficient estimate for

at –0.05. All the remaining estimations

for short-term policy rate are going to be based on the dataset used in column (4).
Meanwhile, Hellerstein (2011) and Dahlquist and Hasseltoft (2013) argued that the longNote that the coefficient estimate for
is –0.249 (although not significant). For all country-periods
with a fixed exchange rate and capital controls, when we plot peripheral countries’ interest rate
changes against US interest rate changes, Argentina in April 2001 is a visible outlier that drives the
negative estimate. We exclude this data point in the remaining estimations.

term interest rate is more correlated across countries than the short-term rate because of
integrated bond markets across countries, in which countries’ term premiums are closely
linked to the US bond premium. Obstfeld (2015) therefore compared the short-term interest
rate with the long-term interest rate in evaluating monetary policy independence and found
that in open economies, the flexible exchange rate allows countries to exercise considerable
monetary autonomy at the short-term structure, but does not have much power at the longterm structure.
We re-visited the conclusion with our modeling specification by replacing policy rates
with 10-year government bond yields. As shown in Table A2 in the Appendix, 10-year
government bond yield data are more limited than those of the policy rate. For long-term
bond yields, we exclude three countries – Argentina, Belarus, and Ecuador – because these
countries did not have appropriate long-term government bond yield data; and exclude
certain episodes since some countries, such as the PRC and Brazil, only have shorter
coverage. The empirical estimation results with long-term government bond yields as the
dependent variable are presented in column (5) in Table 3. Our general conclusion for the
short-term interest rate analysis holds for long-term interest rates. The one period lagged
long-term interest rate ��,

−

has a significant negative sign. The revisions in GDP and CPI

forecasts have significant positive signs, but with a much lower coefficient for CPI revision
(compared with the baseline case for short-term interest rate as in column (4) of Table 3),

which implies that the role of long-term interest rates in domestic macroeconomic targeting
is much smaller than that of the short-term policy rate. Our findings also echo the
argument of Obstfeld (2015): the domestic macro variables play roles in determining longterm interest rates.
As shown in column (5) in Table 3, the coefficients of the exchange rate and capital
control regimes for the long-term interest rate analysis are similar to those under the shortterm interest rate analysis. Coefficients for both regimes without capital controls are
significantly positive with a higher estimate for the regime with fixed exchange rate at 0.68
and a lower estimate for the regime with flexible exchange rate at 0.41. Therefore, our
conclusion that capital controls are more effective in helping economies to be less affected
by US monetary policy shocks and countries with flexible exchange rates without capital

16

controls tend to adjust their policy rates in tandem with the US rate holds for both shortend and long-end of the term structures.
To verify that our findings are not subject to bias induced by a smaller sample for the
long-term bond yield data, we intentionally reduced data set of the short-term policy rates
by focusing on the same country-episodes as in the data for the long-term rates. The results
are shown in column (2) in Table A5 in the appendix and do not change from the baseline
case.
By introducing capital control differentiation explicitly in the model, our findings
partially support and partially refute those of Obstfeld (2015). We found that at the shortend of the term structure, in open economies (regimes without capital controls in our
framework), while the flexible exchange rate allows higher autonomy compared with the
fixed exchange rate, it does not provide total immunity. Our conjecture is that open
economies with flexible exchange rates willingly go in tandem with US monetary policy
changes.

Table 4 presents the estimation results for an extended model that allows for
asymmetric responses under a flexible exchange rate regime and incorporates real
exchange rate stability in the Taylor rule as described by equations (5) and (6). The results
are broadly similar to before. In particular, a flexible exchange rate regime appears to offer
policy autonomy when the center country raises its interest rate, but not when it lowers the
rate. A flexible exchange rate regime in combination with capital controls appears to offer
monetary policy autonomy to peripheral countries. These results are summarized in Figure
1b.

4. The Lower-bound Episodes
The QE approach of the US Federal Reserve creates complications for specification (4)
above, as downward adjustments in the US interest rate are not observed even though the
QE is clearly intended to further loosen the monetary policy stance. More importantly, it is
conceptually possible that the transmission patterns of monetary policy change
qualitatively under QE. In particular, if the US interest rate is stuck near zero, emerging
market exchange rate responses to changes in the US monetary aggregates can be weaker
than when the US interest rate is above zero. Does this happen in the data? Does the
effectiveness of capital controls and the nominal exchange rate regime change from the
normal to the QE world?
In order to answer these questions, we generalize specification (4) by replacing the
observed US interest rate by a latent interest rate, whose value depends on whether the US
interest rate reaches the lower bound. During the lower-bound episodes, agents are
assumed to form their views on US monetary policy by using the US money supply (relative
to aggregate output) instead. The model includes three equations as follows:

is used to

make judgment on whether there is a positive ∆rtUS∗ or negative ∆rtUS∗.

We bootstrap the sample with replacement for 100 times and optimize the logarithm

using a quasi-Newton algorithm for each bootstrapped sample. The standard error from the
100 estimates on bootstrapped samples is used to judge the significance level.
The results are reported in Table 5. Because the maximum likelihood estimation could
be sensitive to the choice of initial values if some initial values lead to a local maximum
that is different from the global maximum, we experiment with different sets of initial
values. In Column 1, we use the OLS estimates (reported in Column 6) as the initial values.
In Columns 2 and 3, we use the OLS estimates plus one or two times their standard errors,
respectively, as the initial values. In Columns 4 and 5, we use the OLS estimates minus one
or two times their standard errors, respectively, as the initial values.
Comparing across the five columns in Table 5, we find broad agreement in the
individual coefficient estimates regardless of the choices of initial values. In particular, we
see evidence in support of the “2.5-lemma” pattern. First, a fixed nominal exchange rate
without capital control offers no monetary policy autonomy (as suggested by

=0.50 to

0.52). Second, a flexible exchange rate regime without capital controls confers no monetary
autonomy when the United States loosens its monetary policy (

but it allows somewhat better policy insulation when the United States tightens its
monetary policy stance (

point estimates are also much closer to zero).
Note that the coefficient on Δ��

is now statistically significant, which is different from

the baseline estimates in Table 3. This might suggest that the notion of a global financial
cycle works more strongly during the QE episodes (2009–2012). Note also that the
coefficients on log money supply and log output have the right signs. For example, a
negative sign on log money supply means that an increase in money supply implies a
reduction in the latent interest rate. However, due to large standard errors, these point

20

estimates are not statistically significant. Finally, Wu and Xia (2016 and Krippner (2014)
provided their estimates of the shadow US interest rate during the US QE period. Because
we jointly estimate the latent interest rate during the QE episode and the international
monetary policy transmissions, our approach is more efficient than pursuing a two-step
approach of estimating the shadow interest rate first and estimating the international
transmissions second. Nonetheless, as a robustness check, we also feed the shadow US
interest rate estimates from Wu and Xia (2016 into Equations (5)–(6) and obtain similar
results as those reported in Table 5.
5. Extensions and Robustness Checks
We conduct a series of robustness checks and extensions. In each exercise, we make one
change to the specification as specified below while maintaining other features of the
baseline case.

Re-defining capital controls
Instead of defining capital controls as a dichotomous variable, we now define it
continuously as 1–(Chinn–Ito index). In this case, a greater value means stricter capital
controls. The results are reported in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6, for short-term and longterm interest rates, respectively.
The pattern of “2.5-lemma” can be seen from the results. First, there is no monetary
policy autonomy by peripheral countries if they have a combination of a fixed exchange rate
and no capital controls. This can be seen from the fact that
significant.

= .487 and is statistically

Second, for a country with a flexible exchange rate regime but without capital controls,
it follows the US policy moves (i.e., no policy autonomy) when the latter loosens monetary
policy (as can be seen by the coefficient on the triple interaction term among a dummy for a
flexible exchange rate, a dummy for US loosening monetary policy, and the change in the
US policy rate to be 0.369 and statistically significant). On the other hand, it appears to not
follow US interest rate moves when the US raises its interest rate.

21

Third, capital controls generally confer monetary policy autonomy to peripheral
countries. For example, for countries on a fixed exchange rate regime, an increase in the
value of the capital controls index from the 25th percentile (or 0.31) to the 75th percentile (or
0.84, approximately the value for the PRC during 1999–2001) would almost eliminate the
impact from changes in the US interest rate (because 0.487–0.727x(0.84–0.31)=0.101)).
However, the coefficient on the interaction term between a fixed rate and the (continuously
valued) capital control index is not statistically significant because the standard error is
large.
Finally, different from Obstfeld (2015), we find no substantive difference between the
result for the long-term interest rate (in Column 2) and that for the short-term interest rate
(in Column 1).

Re-classifying exchange rate regimes
As an alternative to the Reinhart and Rogoff classification, we use the exchange rate
regime classifications in the IMF’s AREAER. We label lack of a separate legal tender,
currency board, and a conventional peg as a fixed exchange rate regime for short. All other
categories are flexible exchange rate regimes. Since we focus on the influence of US
monetary policy changes, the euro zone is represented by one country (Germany) and
classified as a flexible exchange rate regime. More details can be found in Table A1 of the
Appendix.
Regression results with the alternative classifications of nominal exchange rate regimes
are reported in columns (3) and (4) of Table 6. We obtain essentially the same qualitative
conclusions as in the baseline case presented in Table 4. In particular, the “2.5-lemma”
patterns are confirmed in the data.

Alternative specification of the Taylor rule
Instead of estimating the coefficients on output and inflation gaps in the Taylor rule, we
pre-assign 0.5 for the output gap and 1.5 for the inflation gap as suggested by Taylor (1993)
and Hofmann and Bogdanova (2012). Transforming by first difference, we have

With the pre-assigned Taylor rule, both the estimates for inflation gap and real exchange
rate stability became insignificant and much smaller.
Most important for our purpose, we note that the main features of the “2.5-lemma”

continue to hold. For example, under a flexible exchange rate regime, peripheral countries
still follow the United States when the latter loosens its monetary policy (i.e., no autonomy)
but the peripheral countries appear to be able to not follow the United States when the
latter tightens monetary policy. In other words, there is fear of appreciation but not so
much with depreciation. In addition, capital controls appear to offer peripheral countries
monetary policy independence. Also, the difference between the short-term and long-term
interest rates appears minor. So the “2.5-lemma” description also applies to long-term
interest rates.

Using the imposed parameters of 0.5 for output gap and 1.5 for inflation gap, we approximate that the
coefficient of Δ��� �

In a standard SUR specification, one usually has the same number of observations for
each regime. We use a bootstrap approach to create a balanced sample (to obtain 307
observations in each regime, the same as the regime with the most observations). We
repeat the sampling 500 times in Monte Carlo simulations to generate the means and the
associated standard errors. We allow the λs and s to vary while keeping � and �
constant across regimes.

The results are reported in Table 7. In this estimation, we allow for potentially different
parameters in the four regimes (a regime is a combination of nominal exchange rate
arrangement and capital control arrangement). Strikingly, we still get something between a
trilemma and a dilemma: no monetary policy autonomy for peripheral countries with a
fixed exchange rate and no capital controls; partial monetary policy autonomy for countries
with a flexible exchange rate and no capital controls; and monetary policy autonomy for
countries with capital controls.

Another look at the global financial cycle effect
One interesting result from our baseline estimation is that the variable representing the
global financial cycle – Δ��

is not statistically significant, in contrast to Rey (2015) and

Obstfeld (2015). Because Obstfeld (2015) includes all individual euro area countries as
separate observations whereas we group all euro countries into a single observation, the
difference in the samples could be responsible for the difference in the result. To examine

24

this possibility, we bring the euro zone economies back and re-run the regression. As
column (1) in Table 8 shows, once we replicate the sample of Obstfeld (2015), Δ��

becomes

significantly positive in our specification too. In column (2), we exclude the episodes
between 1990 and 1998 but still obtain similar results, This suggests that the “global
financial cycle effects” are mostly driven by treating euro zone economies as separate
observations. There is no robust support for a global financial cycle that is independent
from changes in the center country monetary policy.
The coefficient estimate for the regime with a flexible exchange rate but no capital
controls is 0.24, which is much lower than 0.45, the value of the same coefficient in the
baseline case. This suggests that the euro zone economies collectively are more influenced
by a common global financial cycle but less affected by US monetary policy changes.
It has also been argued that a valuation channel also allows a flexible exchange rate
regime to augment monetary policy effectiveness (see Georgiadis and Mehl, 2015, and
Meier, 2013). According to this hypothesis, when a country has positive net foreign currency
assets, an appreciation of the domestic currency in response to a tightening in local
monetary policy reduces the value of their net foreign currency assets in the local currency
(and so too their total wealth). This leads to a contraction of domestic consumption and
investment, augmenting monetary policy effectiveness. Meanwhile, they suggest that a
global financial cycle can weaken the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy by allowing
consumption smoothing through borrowing from abroad.
We would point out that the valuation channel is precisely one of the reasons why a
flexible exchange rate regime without capital controls tends to follow the US when the US
decreases its interest rate. When the US expands its monetary policy, if the periphery
country does not follow suit, an appreciation of its currency could lead to a contraction of
domestic investment and consumption. The periphery country, even if it has a flexible
exchange rate, chooses to follow the US policy move precisely to nullify the valuation effect.
While if the country has capital controls, the capital controls can effectively help avoid the
“forced” appreciation of the local currency even if the periphery interest rate does not follow
the US interest rate’s movement.

25

In our baseline framework, the global financial cycle effect is captured by Δ��

.

Symmetrically, we add a net foreign asset variable – the share of foreign exchange reserves
to GDP interacting with changes in the US rate. As shown in column (3) of Table 8, this
interaction term has an insignificant estimate, in contrast to Georgiadis and Mehl (2015)
and Meier (2013).

Exchange rate responses to US interest rate changes
Previous discussions suggest that, even for countries with a flexible exchange rate
regime, presence or absence of capital controls makes a difference for the transmission of
monetary policy shocks. Another way to investigate this possibility is to look at exchange
rate responses to changes in the US interest rate. More precisely, we now look at the
difference in the log exchange rate between two WEO reporting times (six months apart) as
the dependent variable (where the exchange rate is defined as units of local currency per
US dollar). The specification on the right hand side is similar to those in Table 3.
The results are reported in Table 9. The key coefficients of interest are the two
associated with the policy regimes. For countries with a flexible exchange rate but no
capital controls, the local currency tends to depreciate by about 2% following a US interest
rate increase by one percentage point, according to Columns 1 or 3. However, for countries
with a flexible exchange rate but with capital controls, the extent of depreciation is much
less at only 0.6%, according to the same two columns. Thus, capital controls appear to blunt
the exchange rate response even for countries with a flexible exchange rate system.
If we use a Talor rule with pre-assigned parameter values (similar to the last two
columns of Table 6), then, following the US interest rate increase, the periphery country’s
currency would depreciate by about 1% if it does not have capital controls, and the
exchange rate appears unresponsive to the US interest rate if the country has capital
controls.
Note that the exchange rate response presumably has already taken into account the
tendency for a periphery country’s interest rate to respond to changes in the US interest
rate. The fact that the observed exchange rate depreciation is bigger for countries without

26

capital controls than for those with capital controls is consistent with the finding in earlier
tables that the periphery country’s interest rate response tends to be less than one for one.
6. Conclusions
In an increasingly inter-connected world, foreign monetary shocks are often a key risk
for emerging market economies and other developing countries. This paper re-examines the
roles of the nominal exchange rate regime and capital flow management in the
transmission of international monetary shocks.
Relative to the existing literature, we introduce several methodological
innovations/improvements. First, we introduce a measure of a country’s desired change in
the interest rate based on a Taylor rule and use the surprise components in inflation
forecasts and growth forecasts by the IMF’s World Economic Outlook to gauge the terms in
the Taylor rule. We also incorporate exchange rate stability as a potential goal of monetary
policy as suggested by Engel (2011). This modification allows us to effectively decompose comovements between a country’s and the US interest rates into two parts, that which is
caused by common shocks to fundamentals in the US and the peripheral country, and that
which reflects the dependence of the peripheral country on US monetary policy, or “fear of
deviations.” Second, since quantitative easing has become a non-trivial part of the recent
US monetary policy history, and little change in the US interest rate is observed during
this period, we also develop a methodology that allows this part of the time series to be
incorporated in the estimation. Third, we examine monetary autonomy both in terms of
long-term and short-term interest rates.
The paper reaches different conclusions from some of the well-known papers in the
literature. In particular, neither a dilemma nor a trilemma characterizes the patterns in
the data completely. Instead, something in between seems to be the norm: for peripheral
countries without capital controls, a flexible nominal exchange rate allows them to have
some policy autonomy when the center country tightens its monetary policy. On the other
hand, when the center country loosens its monetary policy, their “fear of appreciation”
takes over and they often pursue similarly looser monetary policy even if the domestic
Taylor rule suggests otherwise. In this sense, a flexible exchange rate offers asymmetric or
incomplete insulation from foreign monetary policy shocks. In comparison, capital controls

27

do offer insulation from foreign monetary policy shocks for peripheral countries on either a
fixed or a flexible exchange rate regime.
Separately, we do not find robust support for the notion of a global financial cycle that is
separate from the spillover of center country monetary policy shocks.

Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the EMU countries has been reclassified as ‘independently floating’ from ‘exchange

arrangement with no separate legal tender.’ The new classification was based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification
was based on the lack of a separate legal tender.

Comments
The Austral Plan’s second phase was a
crawling peg which lasted until September
1986 but by then, there was a dual market.
For May 1989–March 1990 the regime is a
“hyperfloat.”
A “Target zone”—broad band is
introduced.
The Convertibility Plan, no adjustments to
central parity.
Capital controls are introduced. There are
multiple exchange rates through most of
2001.
+/–5% band. Workers from INDEC, the
state statistical agency, released their own
unofficial inflation estimates that far
outstripped the government’s estimate of
an 8.5% y-o-y CPI increase for 2007. They
reported that 2007 inflation had in fact
been between 22.3% and 26.2%.
+/–2% band.

March 1991 registers as a currency crash
