    "abstract": "\n\nWe investigate the impact of reporting regulation on corporate innovation. Exploiting thresholds in Europe\u2019s regulation, we find that forcing firms to publicly disclose financial statements reduces their innovation activities but does not reduce industry-wide innovation spending. Our findings suggest that reporting regulation imposes proprietary costs on innovative firms, especially smaller ones, thereby discouraging their innovation activity. By extending disclosure requirements to smaller firms, the EU regulation also provides positive information spillovers to other firms (e.g., competitors, suppliers, and customers), especially larger ones, resulting in a concentration of innovation activity. We corroborate these results with an analysis of reporting changes due to a German enforcement reform. In sum, we show financial reporting regulation has aggregate and distributional effects on corporate innovation that are important for policy makers to consider.\n\n",
