ABSTRACT
I extend the classical general equilibrium treatment of uncertainty about exogenous states of
nature to uncertainty about prices. Traders do not know the prices at which markets will clear but
have expectations over possible prices. They trade price-contingent securities (derivatives) to
insure against the risks arising from this uncertainty. I establish four results. One is set of
conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of equilibrium (called an equilibrium
with price insurance) in this framework. A second is that equilibria with price insurance are
Pareto efficient. I give conditions under which agents are fully insured at an equilibrium. Finally I
show that agents' price expectations matter in the sense that they affect the equilibrium allocation
of resources, and that the existence of price-contingent securities alters the equilibrium of the
underlying real economy.

PRICE UNCERTAINTY AND PRICE-CONTINGENT
SECURITIES
GEOFFREY HEAL

Abstract. I extend the classical general equilibrium treatment of uncertainty
about exogenous states of nature to uncertainty about prices. Traders do not
know the prices at which markets will clear but have expectations over possible
prices. They trade price-contingent securities (derivatives) to insure against
the risks arising from this uncertainty. I establish four results. One is set of
conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of equilibrium
(called an equilibrium with price insurance) in this framework. A second is
that equilibria with price insurance are Pareto efficient. I give conditions
under which agents are fully insured at an equilibrium. Finally I show that
agents’ price expectations matter in the sense that they affect the equilibrium
allocation of resources, and that the existence of price-contingent securities
alters the equilibrium of the underlying real economy.

1. Price Uncertainty
Uncertainty about prices has a real welfare cost, just as does uncertainty about
exogenous events such as earthquakes or tropical storms. Prices may affect the value
of our endowments, and there is naturally interest in insurance against this risk. In
advanced economies uncertainty about prices is probably more extensive and more
costly than uncertainty about states of nature (as argued by Shiller [1993]).
There are many markets that meet some of this demand for insurance against
price risks. Options and futures and swap markets, indeed derivative markets in
general, are used extensively to insure against price risks, yet until recently there
have been few attempts to incorporate price uncertainty into the classical ArrowDebreu general equilibrium framework. There is an extensive discussion of the use
of derivative to hedge price risks in the finance literature, but the models used there
are not intended to shed light on issues such as the impact of derivative markets on
the overall allocation of risk in the economy, or on interactions between derivative
markets and the underlying markets for goods and services. These questions are
the focus of this paper: the aim is to establish a framework within which we can
think systemically about interactions between markets for price risks and markets
for goods and services.
How derivatives affect the overall allocation of risks within the economy is particularly pertinent in view of the interest of regulators in the possible systemic
risks associated with derivative markets. Adding to this is the fact that for many
securities the volume of trade in derivatives now exceeds that in the underlying
asset. This suggests that trade in derivative markets might influence the equilibria

in the underlying asset markets, calling into question the premises of some option
valuation models and suggesting a possible systemic impact.
This paper suggests that the introduction of derivative markets in an ArrowDebreu general equilibrium model with price uncertainty leads to an improvement
in resource allocation, with agents benefitting from the ability to insure otherwise
uninsurable risks. There is no evidence of the multiplication of risks or of systemic
risks that have worried regulators.
Earlier work (Chichilnisky et al. [1994], Dreze [1999], Hahn [1999]) has suggested
that uncertainty about prices, which are determined endogenously within the economic system, is conceptually more complex than uncertainty about exogenous
states of nature, with the implication that it is difficult if not impossible to use
price-contingent contracts to manage these risks. In fact there is a very natural
and conceptually simple extension of the classical general equilibrium framework
to price uncertainty, involving the use of price-contingent securities. This provides
a simple and satisfactory account of the welfare and general equilibrium roles of
derivatives in hedging price uncertainty in a complete general equilibrium framework.
1.1. The Framework. I work with a classical exchange economy augmented by
the possibility of trading price-contingent securities (PCSs) which pay a specified
sum if and only if the equilibrium price vector assumes a specified value.1 Prices
play the role of “states of nature” in the Savage or Arrow-Debreu frameworks, but
here the state is determined endogenously, in contrast to the states in the more
traditional frameworks.
Agents hold expectations about possible prices. Before an equilibrium prices is
realized, they trade price contingent securities, shifting income from price states
where they are well off to those where they are badly off. This changes their
endowments in the underlying exchange economy: in addition to conventional endowments of goods and services they hold price-contingent securities that alter the
market values of their total endowments in a way that depends on the price vector
realized.
I do not discuss the source of agents’ price expectations. It suffices to assume
that they do not know the prices that will rule in a forthcoming market equilibrium and in lieu of this knowledge form expectations. There are many possible
explanations for this. To forecast prices accurately an agent would have to know
the preferences and endowments of all other agents, and then be able to compute
the equilibrium of the system. Realistically an agent could fail at any stage of this
process - could not know the preferences or endowments of some others, or could
know these but not have the necessary computational skills. Alternatively, there
may be multiple equilibria so that even knowledge of the model and the ability to
compute its outcomes leaves uncertainty about prices. Chichilnisky et al. [1994]
consider the case of an economy with multiple equilibria, all of which are known to
the participants in the economy, although they do not know which will be realized:
there agent’s expectations are restricted to the set of equilibrium prices. Hahn

Such securities have been discussed in the context of a temporary equilibrium model by
Svensson [1981], and earlier in a growth model by Stigum [1972]. These authors and others (Kurz
and Wu [1996], Henrotte [1992]) have also discussed such securities in a Walrasian framework, but
none have embedded them in the standard general equilibrium framework. de Temple and Selden
[1991] look at the interactions between options markets and markets for the underlying securities.

also focuses on this case, making the point that rational expectations are logically
impossible in this context. For all these reasons it seems eminently plausible that
agents do not know the prices that will rule in a market that is about to open, but
will have expectations about these and will seek to hedge risks generated by this
lack of knowledge.
We can think of agents as making their choices in two stages. In the first stage
they choose portfolios of PCSs in the light of the values of their endowments at
different prices and their expectations about equilibrium prices. Each chooses a
PCS portfolio which maximizes expected utility over equilibrium prices, given their
expectations over prices and given their endowments. Once agents have chosen
portfolios of PCSs, equilibrium prices are realized.2 Now given the equilibrium
prices, agents choose consumption vectors to maximize utility subject to their budget constraints (which depend on their holdings of PCSs). At this stage they face
no uncertainty and act exactly as in a standard exchange economy, except for the
dependence of their endowments on prices.
In modeling this framework we derive an indirect utility function relating an
agent’s expected utility from consumption to her holdings of PCSs: agents select
portfolios to maximize this function. Together with securities prices, this generates
demands for and supplies of securities: the net endowment of any security is zero.
An equilibrium of the entire system, called an equilibrium with price insurance,
is an equilibrium in both the goods and the PCS markets. I establish the following
results: (1) conditions on preferences and price expectations necessary and sufficient for the existence of such an equilibrium (these conditions require that price
expectations overlap in a sense to be made clear), (2) the Pareto efficiency of these
equilibria, which provide agents with insurance against the uncertainty represented
by their prices expectations (3) conditions under which agents are fully insured by
the PCS markets and (4) that agents’ price expectations influence the equilibrium
allocation of resources, that is, derivative markets affect the outcomes in markets
for goods and services. This is of course in the context of a complete set of markets, and so is different from the phenomena that occur in models with incomplete
markets or with temporary equilibria.
If goods and contracts contingent on their prices are traded in the same markets,
then arbitrage will prevent the securities markets from playing a positive role. Once
the prices of goods are announced, then it is immediately clear that only certain
price-contingent securities can have non-zero prices. To avoid this difficulty, we
have to separate the two sets of markets and prevent arbitrage. In real markets,
options and other PCSs are traded before the trading of the goods on whose prices
they are contingent: this is a natural arbitrage-free structure, which I use here.
In the next section I provide simple geometric illustrations of the main concepts
and results of the paper. Then I set out the general model, assumptions, definitions
and results: proofs are in the appendix.
2. Illustrations
In this section I give two examples of how the introduction of PCSs can affect
the equilibrium allocation of goods and services in a competitive economy. They
2
These depend on the portfolios that people have chosen, but, consistent with the standard
competitive assumption, they do not take this into account.

also give some intuition about how the general case works. The examples use a
two-person two-good economy which can be illustrated by an Edgeworth box.
There are two risk-averse agents and with right-angled indifference curves. This
means that there are infinitely many competitive equilibria when this economy is
considered as an exchange economy of the Arrow-Debreu type. The introduction
of price uncertainty and PCSs (which are traded before prices are determined and
which allow this to be insured) leads to a unique equilibrium allocation and the
removal of all price risks.
Agents’ preferences are given by ui = log (min {ci1 , ci2 }) , i = 1, 2, where cij is
agent i’s consumption of good j, j = 1, 2, ci = (ci1 , ci2 ). These combine right-angled
preferences - which make the determination of equilibria easy - with risk aversion.
The total endowment of each of the two goods is one unit, and agent’s endowments
are Ω1 = (1, 0) and Ω2 = (0, 1), placing the endowments at the lower right corner
of the Edgeworth box. We let p = (p1 , p2 ) be a price vector (p1 + p2 = 1, pj ≥ 0∀j).
Note that any strictly positive price vector can be an equilibrium price vector.
Agent i’s holdings of price-contingent securities are represented by si (p) ≷ 0,
which gives the amount she will receive or pay as a function of the equilibrium price
vector in the exchange economy. At a goods price vector p agents’ choice problems
are
(2.1)

max ui = log (min {ci1 , ci2 }) , p1 ci1 + p2 ci2 = pi + si (p)
ci

Demands are given by
(2.2) c11 = c12 =

p2 + s2 (p)
p1 + s1 (p)
= p1 + s1 (p) ; c21 = c22 =
= p2 + s2 (p)
p1 + p2
p1 + p2

Given that s1 (p) + s2 (p) = 0 ∀p and p1 + p2 = 1, it is clear that these demand
functions clear the markets at any prices. As agents consume equal amounts of
both goods, we can write their utilities as function of just the amount of the first
good they consume, which is pi + si (p). If there are no PCSs then any point
on the diagonal of the Edgeworth box (i.e. any point on the contract curve) is a
competitive equilibrium at some suitable price vector.
In the case when there is a market for PCSs, agents choose securities holdings
to maximize expected utility, given their price expectations. First we consider a
case in which agents’ expectation over prices are particularly simple: both expect
that prices will be either p̃ = (0.25,0.75) or p̂ = (0.75, 0.25), and that these two
outcomes are equally likely. Agent 1 therefore seeks to solve the problem
(2.3)

max {0.5log (0.25 + s1 (p̃)) + 0.5log (0.75 + s1 (p̂))}
s1

subject to the securities budget constraint
π (p̃) s1 (p̃) + π (p̂) s1 (p̂) = 0

(2.4)

Here π (p) is the price of a PCS that pays one unit if and only if the market price
vector is p. Let λ1 be the Lagrange multiplier associated with agent 1’s optimization
problem: then from the first order conditions for optimality we have that
(2.5)

s1 (p̃) =

1
1
− 0.25 : s1 (p̂) =
− 0.75
2λ1 π (p̃)
2λ1 π (p̂)

PRICE UNCERTAINTY AND PRICE-CONTINGENT SECURITIES

with analogous results for agent 2:
(2.6)

s2 (p̃) =

1
1
− 0.75 : s2 (p̂) =
− 0.25
2λ2 π (p̃)
2λ2 π (p̂)

Recalling that s1 (p̃) + s2 (p̃) = 0 = s1 (p̂) + s2 (p̂) we now have that π (p̃) =
1
1
2λ1 + 2λ2 = π (p̂). Hence securities prices are independent of which of the two
expected underlying goods price vectors is realized, and agents’ consumption levels,
given by pi + si (p), are also independent of which of these equilibrium prices is
realized.3
Note that the existence of markets for PCSs has not changed the equilibrium
prices in the goods market: rather it has altered the equilibrium allocation of consumption between agents, allowing them to smooth consumption across price states.
If the agents’ expectations did not agree, in the sense that agent one expected prices
p̂ and p̃ while agent two expected prices p̌ and p̆, these being four distinct price
vectors with no two equal, then there would be no trade in PCSs and so no impact
from the existence of such securities.
Now we consider a more complex case. Agents’ price expectations are uniform
over all possible prices. Agent 1 seeks to solve the following problem:
Z 1
Z 1
(2.7)
max
log {p1 + s1 (p)} dp1 :
s1 (p) π (p) dp = 0 :
s1 (p)

0

0

The second integral here is the budget constraint in the securities market. This
makes the problem an isoperimetric problem in calculus of variations. Writing
down a Hamiltonian for this problem and taking first order conditions yields for
each agent the following equations:
(2.8)

s1 (p) =

1
∂λi (p)
1
− p1 : s2 (p) =
− p2 :
= 0 ∀i
λ1 (p) π (p)
λ1 (p) π (p)
∂p

so the shadow prices λi are constants independent of p, and it can then be shown
that π is a constant independent of p. Hence s1 + p1 and s2 + p2 are constants
which means that each agent’s consumption is independent of the goods prices in
the exchange economy.
In this case, as in the first, the existence of PCS markets has not altered the
equilibrium prices in the goods markets: these are whatever they would otherwise
have been. It has however altered the allocation of goods between people in such a
way as to remove price risk. PCSs do this by altering endowments in a way that
depends on the price vector realized.
3. The General Model
The economy E that we consider can be defined formally as follows:
(1) There are n markets for goods and services, and in addition a complete set
of markets for price-contingent securities, i.e. markets for contracts which
will pay one unit of account on the realization of any price vector in the
simplex ∆ ⊂ Rn+ .4
3If neither p̂ nor p̃ is realized then agents’ budget constraints are unchanged from those in the

underlying

(2) A portfolio of securities is an element of the space of functions from the price
simplex to the real line: it assigns to each price vector a number which is the
value of securities held contingent on that price vector. A security pays one
unit if and only if a specified price vector is realized as the equilibrium price
vector, and a portfolio specifies the quantity of securities held contingent
on each possible price vector. We take the space of portfolios to be Hilbert
space L2 , the space of measurable square integrable functions from ∆ ⊂ Rn+
hR
i1/2
2
to the real line. This has the norm ksk = ∆ s (p)
and inner product

R
hx, yi = ∆ x (p) y (p) dp . Securities are elements of the dual to this space
and as L2 is self-dual, both securities and portfolios are in L2 .
(3) There are I agents, i ∈ I. Agents are characterized by endowments Ωi ∈
Rn+ , preferences ui : Rn+ → R, and price expectations ei : 2∆ ⊂ Rn+ → R,
where 2∆ is the σ-algebra of subsets of ∆ and ei (p) is a probability measure
representing agent i’s expectations over possible prices in the simplex. ei (p)
is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra. Agents choose portfolios of
PCSs in the securities markets and the payoffs from these are a part of
their endowments in the goods markets.
(4) Consumption sets are the non-negative orthant Rn+ for goods and L2 for
securities, so unbounded short sales are allowed for PCSs but not for goods.
This seems a natural combination, although other possible combinations
could equally well be covered.
(5) Prices in the goods markets are vectors in p ∈∆ ⊂ Rn+ , and those in securities markets are functions π (p) : ∆ → R giving the cost of a security that
pays one unit if and only if the price is p.
3.1. Behavior in the goods market. Consider behavior in the goods market
once an equilibrium price vector p ∈ ∆ is known. Agent i solves the problem
(3.1)

maxui (ci ) ,
ci

p.ci ≤ p.Ωi + si (p)

Here utility is maximized subject to a standard budget constraint augmented by
the proceeds of trading in the securities market. Denote the maximum of utility
subject to this constraint by wi (p, si (p) , Ωi ). As Ωi will be held fixed in what
follows, we suppress dependence on this and write
(3.2)

wi (p, si (p)) = max ui (ci ) : p.ci ≤ p.Ωi + si (p)
ci

So wi (p, si (p)) denotes the maximum utility attainable if the goods market price
vector is p, as a function of the payoff in this state of PCSs purchased in the
securities market.5 This is an indirect utility function. We can also derive a demand
function di (p, si (p)) showing i’s demand for goods if the price vector is p and
securities holdings are si (p) . Clearly
wi (p, si (p)) = max ui (ci ) : p.ci ≤ p.Ωi + si (p) = ui (di (p, si (p)))
ci

5We can write it w p (s (p)) to show that it can also be interpreted as a state-dependent utility

function if prices are viewed as states.

3.2. Behavior in the securities market. As the goods market price p is seen as a
random variable, agents seek to pick securities so as to maximize the expected utility
from goods, given the wealth resulting from securities holdings and endowments.
We can write this as
Z
Z
(3.3)
max Wi (si (p)) ≡
wi (p, si (p)) dei =
ui (di (p, si (p)))
si (p)

p∈∆

p∈∆

The maximand is the expected utility in the goods market, given the agent’s price
expectations and holdings of securities. Maximization is with respect to the function
si (p) : ∆ → R defining i’s portfolio of PCSs. The budget constraint in the securities
market is
Z
(3.4)
π (p) si (p) dp = 0
∆

This is the inner product of a price vector with a portfolio vector, both in L2 . In
addition to the budget constraint, there is a constraint stating that an agent cannot
sell more income in a price state than she will have in that state:
p.Ωi + si (p) ≥ 0 ∀p

(3.5)

Hence the agent’s optimal choice of PCSs solves the problem

4. Assumptions and Definitions
In this section I set out the assumptions used about consumer preferences and
expectations, and the definitions of some technical concepts that will be used in
the proofs of existence of equilibrium. The strategy of the proof is first to show
that the underlying exchange economy has an equilibrium, and then to show that
the overall economy with securities markets also has an equilibrium. Conditions
sufficient for the exchange economy to have an equilibrium are well-known: here I
give conditions that are necessary as well as sufficient, and then give results that
are necessary and sufficient for existence of equilibrium in the entire system, based
on results in Chichilnisky and Heal [1998]. This makes the arguments slightly more
complex than if we were to focus just on sufficient conditions.
Consumers have preferences over goods, and indirectly have preference over securities. Preferences over goods are assumed to satisfy the following conditions:
Assumption 1. Each agent has preferences
concave con represented by a strictly

tinuously differentiable function ui : N Rn+ → R (where N Rn+ is a neighborhood

of Rn + ) such that ui (0) = 0, sup ui (x) = ∞, ∃ , δ > 0 : ∀x ∈ N Rn+ , 0 <  ≤
x∈R+
n

kDui (x)k ≤ δ where Dui (x) is the first derivative of the function ui at x.
Assumption 2. If an indifference surface through a positive consumption bundle c
intersects a boundary ray r of Rn+ then every indifference surface containing points
preferred to c also intersects the ray r.
Assumption 2 is satisfied by many standard preferences on Rn+ , such as CobbDouglas, CES, linear preferences, most Leontieff preferences and smooth utilities

PRICE UNCERTAINTY AND PRICE-CONTINGENT SECURITIES

defined on a neighborhood of the positive orthant which are transversal to its boundary.
Assumption 3. The indirect utility function Wi (p, si (p)) is normalized so that the
expected indirect utility Wi (si (p)) satisfies Wi (0) = 0 and sup Wi = ∞.
s∈L2

Assumption 4. The expected indirect utility Wi (si (p)) satisfies one of the following two conditions: either each indifference surface is bounded below or the set of
supports to each indifference surface is a closed set.
Definition 1. The goods global cone Ai of agent i consists of all directions in the
space of goods along which i’s utility increases without bound:
Ai (Ωi ) = {z ∈ Rn : ∀y ∈ Rn , ∃λ > 0 : ui (Ωi + λz) > ui (y)}
Definition 2. The cone Gi of agent i is the set of directions in the space of goods
along which i’s utility never ceases to increase:
Gi (Ωi ) = {z ∈ Rn : ∀µ∃λ : ui (Ωi + λz) > ui (Ωi + µz) if λ > µ ≥ 0}
Under assumption 1 the cone Gi (Ωi ) contains the cone Ai (Ωi ) and in addition
contains some of the boundary rays of Ai (Ωi ).
Let Di be the dual to the cone Gi:

n
D i = p ∈ R+
: ∀z ∈ Gi , p.z > 0
and let S (F) be the set of prices that support efficient individually rational and
affordable allocations in the underlying exchange economy E and N the set of prices
which assign some agent zero wealth. Formally

ci ∈P

F=

i Ωi & ∀i, ui (yi ) ≥ ui (cI ) & ∃j : uj (yj ) > uj (cj )
Then
S (F) = {p ∈ ∆ : p supports allocations in F & p.ci = p.Ωi + si (p)}
N = {v ∈ ∆ : ∃j with v.Ωj + sj (v) = 0}
Next we use these to define the goods market cone:
Definition 3. The goods market cone ∂Di of agent i is defined as
∂Di = Di ∩ S (F) if S (F) ⊂ N and ∂Di = Di otherwise
In words, if at all supports to allocations that are feasible, efficient, individually
rational and affordable, some agent j has zero income (including income from securities transactions) then ∂Di consists of those supporting prices at which only
limited increases in utility can be afforded from initial endowments. Otherwise it
is the dual of the set of directions in which utility never ceases to increase.
Definition 4. The economy satisfies limited arbitrage in the goods market if there
is a price vector at which no agent can always derive increased utility from large
zero-cost trades in goods: formally there exists a price vector p ∈ Rn+ assigning
strictly positive value to all vectors in Gi , for i = 1, 2, ..., I or ∩ ∂Di 6= ∅
1≤i≤I

Limited arbitrage states, roughly, that if all supporting prices to allocations
that are efficient, individually rational and affordable imply zero income for some
individual, then there is one supporting price at which only limited increases in

PRICE UNCERTAINTY AND PRICE-CONTINGENT SECURITIES

9

utility are affordable from initial endowments. Otherwise there exists a price at
which only limited increases in utility are affordable.
These definitions have to be modified slightly to apply to the securities markets:
the commodity space is infinite-dimensional and consumption sets are unbounded.
So we have
Definition 5. The securities global cone Ãi of agent i consists of all directions in
the space of securities in which i’s expected utility Wi increases without bound:
Ãi = {z ∈ L2 : ∀y ∈ L2, ∃λ > 0 : Wi (si + λz) > Wi (y)}
Definition 6. The cone G̃i is the set of directions in the securities space in which
i’s expected utility Wi never ceases to increase:
Gi ˜(si ) = {z ∈ L2 : ∀µ∃λ : Wi (si + λz) > Wi (si + µz) if λ > µ ≥ 0}
Definition 7. The securities market cone D̃i is the set of securities prices assigning
positive value to all trades in directions in which expected utility Wi never ceases to
increase:
n
o
D̃i = π ∈ L2 : ∀z ∈ G̃i , hπ, zi > 0
where hπ, zi is the inner product of π and z.
Definition 8 . The economy satisfies limited arbitrage in securities markets if there
is a securities price vector at which no agent can always derive increased expected
utility from arbitrarily large zero-costs securities trades: formally there exists a
price π ∈ L2 assigning strictly positive value to all vectors in G̃i for i = 1, 2, ..., I or
∩ D̃i 6= ∅
1≤i≤I

Note that while limited goods arbitrage places restrictions on differences between
agents’ preferences for goods, limited securities arbitrage places limits on differences
between agents’ preferences for goods and on differences between their price expectations. Even if limited goods arbitrage holds, limited securities arbitrage may fail
if expectations are very different. Limited arbitrage is similar in concept to the
condition of overlapping or similar expectations used as a sufficient condition for
existence of equilibrium in temporary equilibrium models and securities markets
models (see Hammond [1983] and Hart [1974]). The underlying intuition is that to
ensure the existence of an equilibrium we need a condition on preferences that will
prevent any two agents from wanting to take unbounded and opposite positions
(Werner [1987]). We do this by defining a cone of rays along which an agent’s
utility or expected utility increases and then requiring that all such cones intersect.
5. Equilibrium with Price Insurance
An equilibrium with price insurance in the economy E is
(1) A set of PCS prices at which PCS markets clear and such that the associated
PCS holdings for each agent maximize her expected utility according to her
price expectations in goods markets, as indicated in (3.6), and
(2) A set of goods prices and consumption levels such that markets clear and
agents maximize utility as in (3.1). Formally:
Definition 9. An equilibrium with price insurance in the economy E is a set of
PCS prices π ∗ ∈ L2 , of goods prices p∗ ∈ ∆, of PCS holdings s∗i (p) ∈ L2 ∀i,

6. Results
Theorem 1. Under assumptions 1 to 4, there exists an equilibrium with price
insurance in the sense of Definition 9 if and only if the economy satisfies limited
arbitrage in the goods market and in the securities market.
The proof is given in the Appendix.
Theorem 2. Any equilibrium with price insurance is Pareto efficient.
Proof. A standard application of the first theorem of welfare economics.



In general, equilibria with price insurance are neither unique nor fully insured.
In Chichilnisky et al. [1994] the equilibria are unique and fully insured, but in that
paper the assumptions are stronger than here: common price expectations restricted
to the set of Walrasian equilibria and the trading of many levels of derivatives. We
can however prove the following:
Theorem 3. If all agents have identical price expectations and if the support of
these is the set of Walrasian equilibrium price vectors in the underlying exchange
economy, then consumption at the equilibrium with price insurance is constant
across all possible exchange economy prices.
Proof. By assumption 1 agents are risk averse. Let Ci be the set of consumption
vectors for agent i associated with possible equilibrium price vectors for the exchange economy, with cij an element of this set. Take the probability (common
to all agents) of the j-th outcome
cij to be Pj . Then by risk aversion agent i is
P
better off with an allocation
cij Pj equal to her expected allocation than she is
receiving cij with probability Pj . Such an expected allocation is feasible as the total
endowment of the exchange economy is independent of the prices realized. This is
true for all agents. So at a Pareto efficient allocation agents’ consumption vectors
must be state independent.

Note that the state-independent consumption vectors that theorem 3 predicts
will not be equilibrium consumption vectors of the underlying exchange economy,
because endowments will have been altered by trading PCSs.
Theorem 4. In an economy E with price-contingent securities the equilibrium will
differ from any competitive equilibrium in the underlying exchange economy E if
there are non-zero holdings of securities at the equilibrium goods prices.

Proof. Note that the examples of section 2 illustrate this point. Let c∗i,k , p∗k
be one of K competitive equilibrium of the exchange economy E. Suppose the
economy with PCSs has an equilibrium {ĉi , p̂, π̂ (p) , ŝi (p)} with ŝi (p̂) 6= 0 for some
i. Consider first the case in which p̂ = p∗k for some k. Then agents’ budgets are
p∗ .ĉi ≤ p∗ .Ωi + ŝi (p∗ ) which differ from their budgets in the exchange economy E.
If p̂ 6= p∗k for any k then the proposition is clearly true.

Note that securities holdings are a function of price expectations ei (p) (this
follows from the specification of problem (3.6)) so that the equilibrium allocation
in E is affected by agents’ price expectations.

7. Conclusions
A relatively simple extension of the classical general equilibrium framework allows it to incorporate uncertainty about the values of equilibrium prices, a form
of uncertainty which is faced by most participants in modern economies yet which
is not captured in the current formulations of general equilibrium models. This
extension is achieved by the introduction of price-contingent securities, traded in
a framework that prevents arbitrage between the markets for these and the goods
markets. Conditions for the existence of an equilibrium in such an economy are
obvious extensions of those in the classical model.
An interesting open question concerns the determination of the prices of the
price-contingent securities: how are these prices related to those of the underlying
goods and the expectations that agents hold over these? An answer to this question
would provide a general equilibrium approach to the pricing of derivative securities.
We know that the prices of these securities must be in the intersection of the cones
D̃i so this already gives some bounds on possible equilibrium prices, bounds related
to agents’ preferences and expectations.
8. Appendix
This appendix contains the proofs of the main theorems presented above.
Lemma 1. Let s∗i (p) : ∆ ⊂ Rn+ → R be the solution to the consumer’s portfolio
problem (3.6). Then this is a continuous function.
Proof. This follows immediately from the fact that si (p) is the solution to an
isoperimetric variational problem and so solves a differential equation.

Lemma 2. For a given set of PCS holdings, the exchange economy has a competitive equilibrium if and only if it satisfies limited goods arbitrage (definition 4).
Proof. We can use the proof in Chichilnisky [1995] with one minor modification.
On page 97 
in the proof
P of Lemma 3 the correspondence ϕ from the simplex ∆ to
the set T = y ∈ RI : i yi = 0 must be modified so that for each r ∈ ∆
ϕ (r) = {p. [Ω1 + s1 (p) − x1 (r)] , ...., p. [ΩI + sI (p) − xI (r)] : p ∈ P (r)}
Given that si (p) is continuous (Lemma 9 above), upper-semi-continuity of ϕ can
be established exactly as in Chichilnisky page 97, and the proof of existence of an
equilibrium in that paper can be used to establish the lemma.

8.1. Proof of Theorem 1.
Proof. This is direct application of Theorem 5 page 122 of Chichilnisky and Heal
[1998]. Consider the exchange economy H with commodity space and consumption
sets L2 , preferences Wi (si (p)) : L2 → R and initial endowments 0 ∈ L2 . This is
an exchange economy that satisfies all the conditions of Theorem 5 of Chichilnisky
and Heal [1998] and for which the existence of a competitive equilibrium is (by
Theorem 5 of Chichilnisky and Heal [1998]) equivalent to the limited arbitrage
condition of that paper, which in the present contexts is exactly what we have
called limited securities arbitrage. Hence under the conditions of the main theorem
the economy H has a competitive equilibrium. This means that there exists a set
of securities prices π ∗ (p)Pand a set of PCS holdings for each agent s∗i (p) such that
markets for PCSs clear, i s∗i (p) = 0∀p ∈ ∆, and all agents are optimizing subject

i.e. for all i, s∗i (p) maximizes ∆ wi (p, s∗i (p)) ei (p) dp
R ∗ constraints,
subject to ∆ si (p) π ∗ (p) dp = 0 and p.Ωi + si (p) ≥ 0. By Lemma 2 given any set
of PCS holdings, and so in particular the equilibrium holdings s∗i (p), the goods
economy has a competitive equilibrium. Let the prices at this equilibrium be p∗
and the consumption vectors c∗i ∀i. Then the securities holdings s∗i (p, ) securities
prices π ∗ (p), goods prices p∗ and consumption vectors c∗i satisfy all the conditions
of the definition of an equilibrium with price-contingent securities. This completes
the proof of the main theorem.
