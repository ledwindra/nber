    "abstract": "\n\nWe study how privately insured individuals choose lower-limb MRI scan providers. Despite significant out-of-pocket costs and little variation in quality, patients often received care in high-priced locations when lower priced options were available. The choice of provider is such that, on average, patients bypassed 6 lower-priced providers between their homes and treatment locations. We show that referring physicians heavily influence where patients receive care. The influence of referring physicians is dramatically greater than the influence of patient cost-sharing or patients\u2019 home zip code fixed effects. Patients with vertically integrated referring physicians are also more likely to receive costlier hospital-based scans.\n\n",
