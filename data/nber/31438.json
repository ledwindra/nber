    "abstract": "\n\nWe study how political preferences shaped California\u2019s High-Speed Rail (CHSR), a large transportation project approved by referendum in 2008. Voters\u2019 support responded significantly to the projected economic gains in their tract of residence, as measured by a quantitative model of high-speed rail matched to CHSR plans. Given this response, a revealed-preference approach comparing the proposed network with alternative designs identifies strong planner\u2019s preferences for political support. The optimal politically-blind design would have placed the stations nearer to California\u2019s dense metro areas, where it was harder to sway votes, thus increasing the projected economic gains.\n\n",
