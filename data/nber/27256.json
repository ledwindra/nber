    "abstract": "\n\nIn March of 2020, banks faced the largest increase in liquidity demands ever observed.  Firms drew funds on a massive scale from pre-existing credit lines and loan commitments in anticipation of cash flow disruptions from the economic shutdown designed to contain the COVID-19 crisis.  The increase in liquidity demands was concentrated at the largest banks, who serve the largest firms. Pre-crisis financial condition did not limit banks\u2019 liquidity supply.  Coincident inflows of funds to banks from both the Federal Reserve\u2019s liquidity injection programs and from depositors, along with strong pre-shock bank capital, explain why banks were able to accommodate these liquidity demands.\n\n",
