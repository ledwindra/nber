ABSTRACT
US monetary policy shocks induce comovements in the international financial variables that
characterize the “Global Financial Cycle.” One global factor explaining an important share of the
variation of risky asset prices around the world decreases significantly after a US monetary
contraction. Monetary tightening in the US leads to significant deleveraging of global financial
intermediaries, a decline in the provision of domestic credit globally, strong retrenchments of
international credit flows, and tightening of foreign financial conditions. Countries with floating
exchange rate regimes are subject to similar financial spillovers.

Introduction

Observers of balance of payment statistics and international investment positions all
agree: the international financial landscape has undergone massive transformations since
the 1990s. Financial globalization is upon us in a historically unprecedented way, and we
have probably surpassed the pre-WWI era of financial integration celebrated by Keynes in
“The Economic Consequences of the Peace.” The role of the United States as the hegemon
of the international monetary system is however largely unchanged, and has long outlived
the end of Bretton Woods, as emphasized in Farhi and Maggiori (2017) and Gourinchas
and Rey (2017). The rising importance of cross-border financial flows and holdings has
been documented in the literature;1 what has not been explored as much, however, are
the consequences of financial globalization for the workings of national financial markets,
and for the transmission of US monetary policy beyond the national borders. How do
international flows of money affect the international transmission of monetary policy?
What are the effects of global banking on fluctuations in risky asset prices, and on credit
growth and leverage in different economies? Using monthly data covering the past three
decades, this paper’s main contributions are to describe the global financial cycle in risky
asset prices, and to estimate the global financial spillovers of the monetary policy of the
United States, the current hegemon of the international monetary system.
There are multiple channels of transmission of monetary policy. In a standard Keynesian or neo-Keynesian world, output is demand determined in the short-run, and monetary policy stimulates aggregate consumption and investment (see Woodford, 2003 and
Gali, 2008 for classic discussions). In models with frictions in capital markets, expansionary monetary policy leads to an increase in the net worth of borrowers, be they financial
intermediaries or firms, which in turn leads to an increase in lending. This is the credit
channel of monetary policy (Bernanke and Gertler, 1995). Other papers have analyzed
the risk-taking channel of monetary policy (Borio and Zhu, 2012; Bruno and Shin, 2015a;
Coimbra and Rey, 2017), where the risk profile of financial intermediaries plays a key role,
and loose monetary policy relaxes leverage constraints. These channels are complementary. In this paper, we explore empirically the international transmission of monetary

policy that occurs through financial intermediation and global asset prices, an area that
has been largely neglected by the literature.2
Using a dynamic factor model, we document the existence of a unique global factor
in international risky asset prices which explains about 20% of the variance in the data.
With a global Bayesian VAR, we then study the international transmission of US monetary policy mediated through the reaction of risky asset prices, global credit creation and
capital inflows, and the leverage of financial intermediaries; these are the variables that
characterize the ‘Global Financial Cycle’ (Rey, 2013). This is motivated by the dollar
being an important funding currency for intermediaries, and by the fact that a large portion of portfolios worldwide are denominated in dollars.3 We identify US monetary policy
shocks using an external instrument constructed with high-frequency price adjustments
in the federal funds futures market around FOMC announcements, following the lead of
Gürkaynak et al. (2005) and Gertler and Karadi (2015). At the same time, the use of a
rich-information VAR ensures that we control for a wealth of other shocks, both domestic and international, to which the Fed endogenously reacts, above and beyond what is
anticipated by market participants.4
We find evidence of powerful financial spillovers of US monetary policy to the rest
of the world. When the US Federal Reserve tightens, domestic demand contracts, as
do prices. The domestic financial transmission is visible through the rise of corporate
spreads, the contraction of lending, and the sharp falls in the price of financial assets,
such as housing and the stock market. But, importantly, we also document significant
variations in the Global Financial Cycle, that is, the shock induces significant fluctuations
in financial activity on a global scale. Risky asset prices, summarized by the single global
factor contract very significantly. This is accompanied by strong deleveraging of global
banks both in the US and Europe, and a surge in a measure of aggregate risk aversion
in global asset markets. The supply of global credit contracts, and there is an important
retrenchment of international credit flows that is particularly pronounced for the bank2

ing sector. International corporate bond spreads also rise on impact, and significantly
so. These results are consistent with a powerful transmission channel of US monetary
policy across borders, via financial conditions. The contraction of domestic credit and
international liquidity that follows the US monetary policy tightening is confirmed also
for the subset of countries that have a floating exchange rate regime.
The importance of international monetary spillovers and of the world interest rate in
driving capital flows has been pointed out in the classic work of Calvo et al. (1996).5 Some
recent papers have fleshed out the roles of intermediaries in channeling those spillovers.6
Our empirical results on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy via its impact
on risk premia, spreads, and volatility are related to those of Gertler and Karadi (2015)
and Bekaert, Hoerova and Duca (2013) obtained in the domestic US context.7 A small
number of papers have analyzed the effect of US monetary policy on leverage and on the
VIX (see e.g. Passari and Rey, 2015; Bruno and Shin, 2015b). But these studies rely
on limited-information VARs (four to seven variables) and on Cholesky identification
schemes to study the transmission of monetary policy shocks.8 Instead, using a richinformation Bayesian VAR allows, we believe for the first time, the joint analysis of
financial, monetary and real variables, in the US and abroad. Moreover, the use of
external instruments for identification allows us to dispense from often implausible timing
restrictions in the reaction of the variables of interest.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we estimate a Dynamic Factor Model
on world asset prices and show that one global factor explains a large part of the common variation of the data. In Section 3, we estimate a Bayesian VAR identified using

A subsequent literature has echoed and extended some of these findings (see Fratzscher, 2012; Forbes
and Warnock, 2012).

Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012) use balance sheet data to study the role of global banks in transmitting
liquidity conditions across borders. Using firm-bank loan data, Morais, Peydro and Ruiz (2015) find that
a softening of foreign monetary policy increases the supply of credit of foreign banks to Mexican firms.
Using high-quality credit registry data combining firm-bank level loans and interest rates data for Turkey,
Baskaya, di Giovanni, Kalemli-Ozcan and Ulu (2017) show that increased capital inflows, instrumented
by movements in the VIX, lead to a large decline in real borrowing rates, and to a sizeable expansion in
credit supply. Interestingly, they find that the increase in credit creation goes mainly through a subset
of the biggest banks.

It is therefore unclear whether their results survive a more robust identification of monetary policy
shocks. The problem of omitted variables is also an important issue in small scale VARs (see Caldara

4.2). Section 5 concludes. Details on data and procedures, and additional results are in

One Global Factor in World Risky Asset Prices

In order to summarize fluctuations in global financial markets we specify a Dynamic
Factor Model for a large and heterogenous panel of risky asset prices traded around the
globe. The econometric specification, fully laid out in Appendix B, is very general, and
allows for different global, regional and, in some specifications, sector specific factors.9
The panel includes asset prices traded on all the major global markets, a collection of
corporate bond indices, and commodities price series (excluding precious metals). The
geographical areas covered are North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and
Australia, and we use monthly data from 1990 to 2012, yielding a total of 858 different
prices series.10 Despite the heterogeneity of the asset markets considered, we find that
the data support the existence of a unique common global factor; moreover, this factor
alone accounts for over 20% of the common variation in the price of risky assets from all
continents.11 The factor is plotted in Figure 1, solid line.
While in this instance we prefer cross-sectional heterogeneity over time length, we are
conscious of the limitations that a short time span may introduce in the VAR analysis
we perform in the next section. To allow more flexibility in that respect, we repeat the
factor extraction on a smaller set, where only the US, Europe, Japan and commodity
9

A similar specification has been adopted by Kose et al. (2003) and Kose et al. (2012) for real variables;
they test the hypothesis of the existence of a world business cycle and discuss the relative importance of
world, region and country specific factors in determining domestic business cycle fluctuations.
10
All the details on the construction and composition of the panels, shares of explained variance, and
test and criteria used to inform the parametrization of the model (Table B.2) are reported in Appendix
B. We fit to the data a Dynamic Factor Model (Stock and Watson, 2002a,b; Bai and Ng, 2002; Forni
et al., 2000, among others) where each price series is modelled as the sum of a global, a regional, and an
asset-specific component. All price series are taken at monthly frequency using end of month figures.
11
We formally test for the numbers of factors in our large panel of asset prices and find that the data
support one common global factor. Results are reported in Table B.2 in the Appendix.

Similar to the benchmark case, for this narrower panel too we find evidence of one global
factor. In this case, however, the factor accounts for about 60% of the common variation
in the data (see Table B.2). For both samples, factors are obtained via cumulation of
those estimated on the stationary, first-differenced (log) price series, and are therefore
consistently estimated only up to a scale and an initial value (see Bai and Ng, 2004, and
Appendix B).12 As a way of normalization, we rotate the factor such that it correlates
positively with the major stock market indices in our sample, i.e. an increase in the index
is interpreted as an increase in global asset prices.
Figure 1 shows that movements in the factor are consistent with both the US recession
periods as identified by the NBER (shaded areas), and with major worldwide events.
The index declines with all the recession episodes but remains relatively stable until the
beginning of the nineties, when a sharp and sustained increase is recorded. The increase

lasts until 1997-1998 when major global events like the Russian default, the LTCM bailout
and the East Asian Crisis reverse the increasing path associated with the build up of the
dot-com bubble. Starting from the beginning of 2003 the index increases again until the
beginning of the third quarter of 2007. At that point, with the collapse of the subprime
market, the first signals of increased vulnerability in financial markets become visible.
This led to an unprecedented plunge.
In order to provide some interpretation for our estimated global factor, we note that in
a large class of asset pricing models, including in the stylized framework that we present in
Section 4, the common component of risky asset prices reflects aggregate volatility scaled
by the aggregate degree of effective risk aversion in the market. In Figure 2 we highlight
the comovement of our factor with a series of implied volatility indices for the markets
included in our sample. Specifically, the VIX for the US, the VSTOXX and VFTSE
for Europe and the UK respectively, and the VNKY for Japan. These indices capture
both the price and quantity of risk, and hence reflect both expectations about future

realized volatility, and risk aversion.13 Because of our chosen normalization, we expect
our factor to correlate negatively with the implied volatility indices. Indeed, this is clearly
visible in the charts of Figure 2. The factor and the implied volatility indices display a
remarkable common behaviour and peaks consistently coincide within the overlapping
samples. While the comparison with the VIX is somehow facilitated by the length of the
CBOE index, the same considerations extend to all other indices analyzed.14
Lastly, we separate the aggregate risk aversion and volatility components in our factor.15 The construction of our proxy for aggregate risk aversion is modelled along the lines
of e.g. Bekaert et al. (2013), that estimate variance risk premia as the difference between

Comparison with other ‘risk indices’ such as the GZ-spread of Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) and

volatilities.

a measure of the implied variance (the squared VIX) and an estimated physical expected
variance, which is primarily a function of realized volatilities. Specifically, we first obtain an estimate of realized monthly global volatility using daily returns of the global
MSCI Index.16 Second, we calculate a proxy for aggregate risk aversion as the inverse
of the centred residuals of the projection of the global factor on the realized variance.
The results of this exercise are summarized in Figure 3. Our monthly measure of global
realized variance is in the top panel, while the implied index of aggregate risk aversion
is in the bottom panel. Interestingly, the degree of market risk aversion that we recover
from this simple decomposition is in continuous decline between 2003 and the beginning
of 2007, and it decreases to very low levels, at a time where volatility was uniformly low,
global banks were prevalent, and may have been the ‘marginal buyers’ in international
financial markets.17 Indeed, Shin (2012) documents the large and increasing share of
banking flows in aggregate capital flows over that period and until 2008; subsequently,
both as a consequence of the crisis and of the changes in regulation, their relative impor16

We work under the assumption that monthly realized variances calculated summing over daily returns
provide a sufficiently accurate proxy of realized variance at monthly frequency.
17
Our empirical proxy for aggregate risk aversion could reflect also other factors such as expected cash
flow growth or risk free rates. In the empirical analysis of Section 3 of the next section, these other
factors are however controlled for by the information contained in our VARs, which include interest rates
and industrial production.

tance has declined. For illustrative purposes, we report data relative to aggregate capital
flows as a percentage of world GDP in Figure 4. Interestingly, the timing of the surge
of banking flows coincides with the decline in global risk aversion in 2003. Estimated
aggregate risk aversion starts increasing during 2007 then jumps up during the financial
crisis with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and remains persistently at high levels,
as the importance of global banks declines. We further explore the connection between
the sharp increase in banking flows and the decline in global risk aversion in Section 4.
In the next section we estimate the effects of US monetary policy on the global factor, on
global risk aversion, and on other variables that characterize the Global Financial Cycle.

US Monetary Policy and the Global Financial Cycle

With the US dollar being the currency of global banking, monetary actions in the US may
directly influence the Global Financial Cycle by altering the cost of funding for major
global banks, and hence their leverage decisions. US monetary policy also affects the pricing of dollar assets, both in the US and abroad, through a direct discount channel and/or
by changing the type of marginal investors in international asset markets.18 Furthermore,
monetary conditions of the centre country can be transmitted through cross-border capital flows, or through the internal pricing of global banks, and influence the provision
of credit outside US borders (see the corroborative evidence in Morais et al., 2015 for
Mexico, and in Baskaya et al., 2017 for Turkey).
To study the effects of US monetary policy on the Global Financial Cycle (GFC), we
use rich-information VARs with both domestic and international variables that provide
us with a unique framework to analyze the transmission of monetary policy beyond
national borders.19 There are a number of advantages that come with this choice. Most
obviously, relying on a unique specification permits addressing the effects of US monetary
policy on the GFC against the background of the response of the domestic business
18

Security-level evidence provided by Schreger et al. (2017) shows that firms who finance themselves in
dollars are by and large the only ones able to attract a worldwide investors base. For a model where low
funding costs lower aggregate effective risk aversion and increase leverage see Coimbra and Rey (2017).

cycle. This acts both as a complement to the analysis, and as a disciplining device to
ensure that the identified shock is in fact inducing responses that do not deviate from
the standard channels of domestic monetary transmission. Moreover, the dimensionality
and composition of the set of variables included in the VAR greatly reduce the problem
of omitted variables that generally plagues smaller systems and is likely to invalidate the
identification of the structural shocks.20
We start by looking at how US monetary policy affects domestic real and financial
conditions in a ‘closed economy VAR’. Then, we augment a small set of core domestic
variables with those that characterize the GFC; namely, global credit and capital inflows,
global factor in asset prices and risk aversion, and the leverage of US and European banks.
In this first version of our empirical framework, global variables are world aggregates,
and bundle together countries with different exchange rate regimes. To evaluate to what
extent a floating exchange rate can provide some insulation against foreign shocks, we
then repeat the analysis by specifically focusing only on the subset of ‘floaters’, following
the IMF’s de-facto classification.

3.1

Identification of US Monetary Policy Shocks

We identify US monetary policy shocks using an external instrument (Stock and Watson, 2012, 2018; Mertens and Ravn, 2013). The intuition behind this approach is that
the mapping between the VAR innovations and the structural shock of interest can be
estimated using only moments of observables, provided that a valid instrument for such
shock exists. The contemporaneous transmission coefficients are a function of the regression coefficients of the VAR residuals onto the instrument, up to a normalization. Hence,
given the instrument, this method ensures that we can isolate the causal effects of a US
monetary policy shock on the dynamics of our large set of variables without imposing
any timing restrictions on the responses. Intuitively, if the instrument correlates with
the VAR innovations only via the contemporaneous monetary policy shocks, a projection
20

Bańbura et al. (2010) show that a medium-scale VAR of comparable size and composition to the one
used in this paper is able to correctly recover the shocks and reproduce responses that match theoretical
ones. Intuitively, the large degree of comovement among macroeconomic variables makes it possible for
VARs of such size to effectively summarize the information contained in large VARs typically counting
over hundred variables.

11

of the VAR innovations on the instrument isolates variations in the variables which are
solely due to the shock (Miranda-Agrippino and Ricco, 2018).
The crucial step of this identification strategy is, naturally, the choice of the instrument. We rely on high-frequency movements in federal funds futures markets around
FOMC announcements to identify the monetary policy shocks, following the lead of
Gürkaynak et al. (2005) and Gertler and Karadi (2015). Specifically, we use 30-minutes
price revisions (or surprises) around FOMC announcements in the fourth federal funds
futures contracts (FF4), and we construct a monthly instrument by summing up the
high-frequency surprises within each month. Because these futures have an average maturity of three months, the price revision that surrounds the FOMC monetary policy
announcements captures revisions in market participants expectations about the future
monetary policy stance up to a quarter ahead. As observed in Miranda-Agrippino (2016)
and Miranda-Agrippino and Ricco (2017), market-based monetary surprises such as the
ones we use map into the shocks only under the assumption that market participants
can correctly and immediately disentangle the systematic component of policy from any
observable policy action. In the presence of information asymmetries, the high-frequency
surprises are also a function of the information about economic fundamentals that the
central bank implicitly discloses at the time of the policy announcements.21 Failure to
account for this effect hinders the correct identification of the shocks, resulting in severe
price and real activity puzzles particularly in small VARs. Here we address this issue by
relying on the rich information in our VARs. The information sets in our VARs controls
for a wealth of other shocks, both domestic and international, to which the Fed endogenously reacts, and allows identification of monetary policy shocks above and beyond what
is expected by market participants.
In Table 1, we report first stage IV statistics of the projection of the VAR innovation
for the policy interest rate (1 year rate in our case) on our instrument (FF4). For
comparison, we also include first-stage statistics obtained with the narrative instrument
of Romer and Romer (2004), that we have extended up to the end of 2007 (MPN). A
21

This implicit disclosure of information is referred to as the Fed information effect in Nakamura and
Steinsson (2017), and the signalling channel of monetary policy in Melosi (2017). The concept is similar
to the Delphic component of forward guidance announcements in Campbell, Evans, Fisher and Justiniano
(2012).

first-stage F statistic below 10 is an indication of potentially weak instruments (Stock
et al., 2002). The three VARs in the table are (1) a closed economy 13-variable VAR that
includes only US variables; (2) a global 15-variable VAR that includes GFC variables as
world aggregates; (3) and a global 15-variable VAR that focuses on the subset of countries
with floating exchange rates. All VARs are monthly and estimated with 12 lags over the
sample 1980-2010 using standard macroeconomic priors. Details on the composition of
each VAR are reported in Table 2 in the next subsection.
Results in Table 1 show that in a domestic context, and conditional on the richinformation VAR composition of Table 2, either instrument attains satisfactory levels of
relevance, with first stage F -statistics safely above the weak instrument threshold. As we
discuss in the next subsection, in this case the two instruments retrieve relatively similar
dynamic responses to a monetary policy shock. The relevance of the narrative series, and
the plausibility of the impulse response functions (IRFs) identified with this instrument
however, deteriorate dramatically in both open economy global VARs. In contrast, the
first stage IV statistics associated to the high-frequency based identification are only
marginally altered in the three cases. This confirms the strong informative content of our
preferred instrument.22

The Transmission of US Monetary Policy through the Global
Financial Cycle

We present our results in the form of dynamic responses to a US monetary policy shock
that is normalized to increase the policy rate by 1% on impact. We use the 1-year
government bond rate as monetary policy variable; this, coupled with the 3-month horizon
embedded in our external instrument implies that we capture standard monetary policy
shocks that affect the fed funds rate, but also implicit and explicit Fed communication
and actions that affect interest rates at longer maturities. All VARs are estimated using
standard macroeconomic priors, with 12 lags at monthly frequency over the sample 1980:1
shocks and their effects on financial markets is Ha (2016).

14

- 2010:12. In this section we report and discuss impulse response functions (IRFs) only
for the variables of interest; full sets of IRFs are reported in the Appendix. The variables
that we include in our baseline VARs are listed in Table 2, together with the composition
of all the VARs we estimate for the results presented in the remainder of the section.
Details on the construction of the data are reported in the Appendix that also collects
robustness tests. We report median IRFs together with 68% and 90% posterior coverage
bands.
Domestic Responses. We start our empirical exploration by looking at the domestic
responses of financial markets and macroeconomic aggregates (Figure 5). To give further
motivation for the choice of our instrument, Figure 5 compares for each variable the
IRFs obtained with the high-frequency IV (FF4, solid lines) and the narrative IV (MPN,
dashed lines). The VAR is the same in the two cases.
A contractionary monetary policy shock depresses prices and economic activity in line
with the standard transmission channels. Production and capacity utilization contract, as
do housing investments, while the unemployment rate rises significantly; these effects are
not sudden, but build up over the horizons. Similarly, prices adjust downward. We note
here that the MPN IV recovers responses that display a pronounced price puzzle. This
is in contrast to our preferred identification via high-frequency instruments: following
an initial downward revision, prices continue to slide into negative territory, in a manner
consistent with the presence of price rigidities. The shock also has important consequences
for domestic financial markets. The response of the one year rate dies out very quickly;
comparing the responses of the policy rate and the slope of the yield curve we note
that the fast rebound of the policy rate is not sufficient to generate the implied 40bps
increase in the 10-year rate. Hence, a first effect of the shock is that it decreases the term
spread. The heightened levels of perceived risk aversion are confirmed also by the sudden
rise in the excess bond premium variable of Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) that measures
corporate bond spreads net of default considerations. This measure also implies increased
costs of funding in the corporate market, and provides evidence of a powerful financial
amplification mechanism of monetary policy shocks that operates at the domestic level.
Expectations of lower economic activity are immediately priced-in in the stock market

that registers a very strong and very sudden drop. Household finance also deteriorates
substantially, with house prices falling and mortgage spreads increasing very significantly.

Finally, the monetary contraction results in a significant appreciation of the dollar against
a basket of foreign currencies.
The system of domestic dynamic responses highlights a powerful transmission of monetary policy shocks through the domestic financial markets. In the remainder of this section we will explore how monetary policy shocks spill over across borders through their
effect on global financial conditions.
Global Financial Cycle: World Aggregates. We start by analyzing the responses
of global asset markets, as summarized by the global factor in risky asset prices, and the
implied degree of aggregate risk aversion in global markets, as estimated in Section 2.
Second, we study the responses of global domestic credit and international capital
flows. Our global credit variables are world aggregates, and bundle together countries
with different exchange rate regimes.23 We compute global variables as the cross-sectional
sum of country-specific equivalents which are in turn constructed following the instructions detailed in Appendix A. Global inflows are direct cross-border credit flows provided
by foreign banks to both banks and non-banks in the recipient country (see Avdjiev et al.,
2012).
Finally, we look at banks’ leverage. Here we separate brokers/dealers and G-SIBs24
from the aggregate banking sector, due to their different risk-taking behavior. Data for
credit, international inflows, and leverage are originally available at quarterly frequency.
We convert them to monthly frequency by interpolation. Full sets of responses are collected in Figures D.1 to D.3 in the Appendix. Results are robust to starting the estimation
sample in January 1990.

A contractionary US monetary policy shock impacts global asset markets (Figure 6).
Upon realization of the monetary contraction, global risky asset prices, as summarized
by the global factor, contract abruptly. While the factor has no meaningful measurement

unit, we can quantify the effects on global stock markets by looking at its contribution
to the overall fluctuations in the major indices. The factor explains about 20% of the
common variation in our panel of international asset prices. If we assume that all asset
prices load equally on the factor, the 40% impact fall would roughly translate into a
8% impact decrease in the local stock market. This number is consistent with both the
response of the local US stock market (Figure 5), and European markets discussed at the
end of the section (Figure 10).
The aggregate degree of risk aversion – i.e. the component of our factor that is orthogonal to realized volatilities in global markets as constructed in Section 2 – rises sharply.
The rise is consistent with the heightened levels of domestic measures of risk premia.
Importantly, it offers a potentially very powerful channel of international transmission
of domestic monetary policy by altering the degree of risk aversion of international investors. We explore this point further when we discuss the response of global banks’
leverage below. Quantifying the rise in risk aversion is less straightforward; but the
shock substantially raises it by over 50% above its average trend.
Figure 7 collects the responses of global economic activity, global domestic credit,
and global credit inflows. The Figure combines together responses extracted from the
VARs (2) and (3) in Table 2. The US monetary policy contraction leaves global growth

unchanged on impact. The inclusion of global growth here serves two purposes. First, it
allows us to consider changes in global financial conditions once we have controlled for
economic activity on a global scale. Second, it helps ensure that we are not confounding
the effects of a US monetary policy shock with other global shocks that affect credit
through their effects on growth.
Following a US monetary policy contraction we register a sharp decrease in credit
provision and a strong retrenchment of global capital inflows. The contraction in global
domestic credit is not driven by US domestic credit, as shown in the lower left panel of the
figure. Global capital inflows respond in a similar fashion: following an initial contraction,
international funding flows continue to decrease to rebound at larger horizons. In the
lower section of the figure we report the responses of capital inflows split by recipient

type. The overall picture is consistent with a reduction of flows directed to both banking
and private sectors. The decline in credit, both domestic and cross-border, whether we
look at flows to banks or to non-banks, is in the order of several percentage points and
thus economically significant.
Lastly, we present the responses of banks’ leverage in Figure 8. We use data on the
leverage of US Security Brokers and Dealers (USBD) and Globally Systemically Important
Banks (GSIBs) operating in the Euro Area and the UK. Data on total financial assets
and liabilities for USBD are from the Flow of Funds of the Federal Reserve Board, while
the aggregate leverage ratios for global banks in the EA and the UK are constructed
using bank-level balance sheet data following the instructions detailed in Appendix A.25
Consistent with increased funding costs, heightened levels of risk aversion and declining
asset prices that alter the valuation of banks’ balance sheets, the financial leverage of
global investors strongly and quickly contracts after a monetary tightening, both among
US Brokers & Dealers, and European global banks. Again, the responses are in the
order of several percentage points, and hence economically relevant. But the responses
appear to be more delayed and more muted for the total balance sheet of the banking

Section 4.2 we extend these results to an international sample of banks.

20

sector. While no appreciable change is visible for the US, the leverage of European banks
contracts significantly to bottom about a year after the shock hits. The reduction in
leverage is more modest and more delayed when compared to that of the G-SIB and the
Broker-Dealers. Domestically oriented retail banks take longer to adjust, so that broader
banking aggregates only react with a delay to monetary policy shocks, which instead
affects more immediately the large banks with important capital market operations.
Taken together, the responses collected in Figures 6 to 8 provide evidence of a powerful
channel of international transmission of US monetary policy that operates through global
financial markets, besides the more standard channels related to international trade. By
being able to generate comovements in asset prices, credit, risk appetite and financial
leverage of global investors, US monetary policy can influence fluctuations in the Global
Financial Cycle. A monetary policy contraction rises funding costs, not only domestically,
but also on a global scale. This is likely the joint outcome of the dollar being the dominant
currency for international financial transactions, and the interconnectedness of global
financial intermediaries. In this respect, a key role is played by global investors, namely,
global banks in both the US and Europe, who influence the way in which funds are
channeled. The strong retrenchments in domestic credit and international capital flows
directed towards both the banking and private sectors provides compelling evidence of
how the deterioration of global financial conditions concretely affects countries.
Global Financial Cycle: Floaters. An important question regarding Figure 7 is
whether the global contraction in credit is driven by countries that have a fixed or pegged
exchange rate regime vis-a-vis the Dollar. In order to address this question, we use the
IMF’s de-facto classification of exchange rate regimes to isolate the subset of countries
in our panel classified as ‘independently floating’.26 We then construct aggregates for
these countries as the cross-sectional sum of their respective levels of domestic credit
and capital inflows, using the same definitions as before (further details on the data
are in Appendix A). Full sets of responses are collected in Figures D.4 and D.5 in the
26

Appendix. Figure 9 collects the responses of credit and capital inflows for the subset
of floaters. These are obtained by substituting world aggregates with floaters country
aggregates in the same VAR used to estimate the previous sets of responses (see Table
2). Again in this case we control for global economic activity. The IRFs in Figure 9 show
that countries with a floating exchange rate regime seem to be equally exposed to US
monetary policy shocks. In fact, the magnitude of the contraction in the credit variables
is very similar to that obtained over the full sample. It should be clear that these results
do not imply that exchange rate regimes are equivalent. However, they do indicate that
the exchange rate regime may not be successful in providing a fully protective shield
against US monetary policy shocks, and that fluctuations in the Global Financial Cycle
can affect in a significant way all countries, even those with a floating exchange rate. We
explore this point further below.
Global Financial Cycle: Currencies, Credit, and Monetary Independence.
We finally turn to evaluate in more details how financial conditions transmit across borders by restricting our attention to the case of the UK and Euro Area, two important
currency areas with flexible exchange rates against the dollar. Full set of responses are
shown in Figures D.6 and D.7 in the Appendix.

Figure 10 collects the responses of the local stock market indices, of bilateral exchange
rates vis-à-vis the dollar, corporate bond spreads, and policy interest rates for the UK (top
row of the figure) and the Euro Area (bottom row of the figure).27 We note that for all
these variables the responses across the two countries are remarkably similar. Consistent
with the fall in the global factor in risky asset prices, the local stock market indices
plummet on impact to a very similar degree. The dollar appreciates significantly against
both currencies. The exchange rate is in both cases measured as units of the foreign
currency per one US dollar, such that a positive reading corresponds to an appreciation
of the dollar. The appreciation is relatively short-lived in both cases, and reverts in the

span of one to four quarters after the shock hits. The US monetary policy shock sizeably
alters funding costs in both the UK and Euro Area, with corporate bond spreads rising
very significantly and on impact in both cases. Finally, the responses of the policy rates
suggest that a US contractionary monetary policy shock is likely to be followed by an
endogenous easing in both the UK and the Euro Area, as a response to the deterioration
in the local financial conditions. While estimated with a higher degree of uncertainty
in the case of the UK, the magnitude of the responses is very similar in the two cases,
and implies an endogenous monetary easing of about 30bps. This also implies that the
tightening of financial conditions in the UK and the Euro Area cannot be ascribed to a
domestic monetary policy tightening, and are instead a consequence of the US monetary
policy spillovers.

Interpretation of the Results

4.1

A Simple Model with Heterogeneous Investors

The empirical results show that US monetary policy affects global banks’ leverage, risky
asset prices and global risk aversion. In this section, we present a stylized framework
to help with the interpretation of these empirical findings; the model builds directly on
the work of Zigrand et al. (2010).28 Our illustrative model of international asset pricing
features investors with heterogeneous risk-taking propensities, in order to make sense of
a time-varying degree of aggregate effective risk aversion.29 The risk premium depends
on the wealth distribution between leveraged global banks on the one hand, and asset
managers, such as insurance companies or sovereign wealth funds, on the other hand. As
the relative wealth of the two types of investors fluctuates, asset pricing will be determined
mostly by one type of investor or the other.
We consider a world with two types of investors: global banks and asset managers.
Global banks and asset managers account for a large part of cross-border flows, as noted
28

in Figure 4. Global banks are leveraged entities that fund themselves in dollars for their
operations in capital markets. They can borrow at the US risk-free rate and lever to
buy a portfolio of world risky securities, whose returns are in dollars. They are riskneutral investors and subject to a Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint, which is imposed by
regulation.30 We present microeconomic evidence pertaining to the leverage and risk taking behaviour of banks in Section 4.2. The second type of investors are asset managers
who, like global banks, acquire risky securities in world markets and can borrow at the
US risk-free rate. Asset managers also hold a portfolio of regional assets (for example
regional real estate) which is not traded in financial markets, perhaps because of information asymmetries. Asset managers are standard mean-variance investors and exhibit
a positive degree of risk aversion that limits their desire to leverage.31

Global Banks
Global banks maximize the expected return of their portfolio of world risky assets subject
to a Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint.32 The VaR imposes an upper limit on the amount
a bank is predicted to lose on a portfolio with a certain probability. We denote by Rt
the vector of excess returns of all traded risky assets in the world (in dollars). We denote
B
by xB
t the portfolio shares of a global bank, and by wt the equity of the bank. The

maximization problem of a global bank is
max Et xB0
t Rt+1



xB
t

subject to VaRt ≤ wtB ,
where VaRt is defined as a multiple α of the standard deviation of the bank portfolio
30

Their risk neutrality is an assumption which may be justified by the fact that they benefit from an
implicit bailout guarantee, either because they are universal banks, and are therefore part of a deposit
guarantee scheme, or because they are too systemic to fail. Whatever the microfoundations, the crisis
has provided ample evidence that global banks have taken on large amounts of risk and that this risk
was not priced by creditors.
31
The fact that only asset managers, and not the global banks, have a regional portfolio is non essential;
global banks could be allowed to hold a portfolio of regional loans or assets as well. The asymmetry
in risk aversion (risk neutral banks with VaR constraint and risk averse asset managers), however, is
important for the results.
32
VaR constraints have been used internally for the risk management of large banks for a long time
and have entered the regulatory sphere with Basel II and III. For a microfoundation of VaR constraints,
see Adrian and Shin (2014).

Taking the first order condition, and using the fact that the constraint is binding

where we use Var to denote the variance. This is formally similar to the portfolio allocation of a mean-variance investor. In Eq. (1), λt is the Lagrange multiplier: the VaR
constraint plays the same role as risk aversion.33

Asset Managers
Asset managers are standard mean-variance investors with a constant degree of risk aversion equal to σ. They have access to the same set of traded assets as global banks. We
call xIt the vector of portfolio weights of the asset managers in tradable risky assets. Asset
managers also invest in local (regional) non-traded assets. We denote by ytI the fraction
of their wealth invested in those regional assets (their net supply is yt ). The vector of
I
excess returns on these non tradable investments is RN
t . Finally, we call wt the equity of

asset managers. An asset manager chooses his portfolio of risky assets by maximizing

It is possible to solve out for the Lagrange multiplier using the binding VaR constraint (see Zigrand

sum of a global component and a regional component:

where Γt ≡

wtB + wtI . The global component of risky asset prices is equal

to the aggregate variance scaled by the aggregate degree of effective risk aversion Γt .
Γt is the wealth-weighted average of the ‘risk aversions’ of the asset managers and the
global banks. It can be interpreted as the aggregate degree of effective risk aversion of
the market. If all the wealth were in the hands of asset managers, for example, aggregate
risk aversion would be equal to σ. Using Eq. (3) as a guiding framework, in Section 2
we extracted the global factor in world risky asset prices by writing each price series as
the sum of a global, a regional and an asset specific component. We then used Eq. (3) to
extract our empirical proxy for aggregate risk aversion Γt .34 One possible interpretation
of the decline in the measure of aggregate risk aversion observed between 2003 and 2007
in Figure 3 is therefore that it was driven by risk-neutral global banks becoming large
and important for the pricing of risky assets, sustaining an increase in risky asset prices
on a global scale. This trend reversed after the crisis, when instead more risk-averse asset
managers became relatively bigger (see Figure 4).
Proposition 2 (Global Banks Returns) The expected excess return of a global bank
portfolio in our economy is given by

Et (xB0

t Rt+1 , yt Rt+1 ),

(4)

where βtBW is the beta of a global bank with the world market portfolio.
The higher the correlation of a global bank portfolio with the world portfolio (i.e. highβtBW ), the more the bank loads on world risk, the higher the expected asset return, ceteris
paribus.
34

As mentioned earlier, in general our empirical proxy for aggregate risk aversion could also reflect
other factors such as expected dividend growth or risk free rates. We however control for these other
factors in the Bayesian VARs.

4.2

Evidence on Global Banks

In this section we use balance sheet data to provide some evidence on the risk taking
behavior of banks, in line with our simple model. Adrian and Shin (2010) show that
the leverage of US brokers-dealers is procyclical. Using balance sheet data for a large
sample of international financial institutions (see Table A.4), some of which were used
to construct the leverage aggregates in Section 3, we find that the positive association
between leverage growth and balance sheet growth goes well beyond US borders. We
report these results in Figure A.3 in the Appendix.35 The procyclicality of leverage tends
to be a stronger feature of the behavior of financial institutions that engage in global
capital markets operations, a subset which included in particular the former stand-alone
investment banks. The same holds true for the large European (UK, Euro Area and
Switzerland) universal banks, whose investment departments have played a central role in
channelling US dollar liquidity worldwide in the years immediately preceding the financial
crisis (see Shin, 2012). Many of those large European Banks are GSIBs.
Figure 11 is the empirical counterpart of Eq. (4), and reports the correlation between
the returns of each bank and their loading (βtBW ) on the world portfolio, summarized
by our global factor of Section 2. Results in panels (a) and (b) are calculated over the
entire population of banks, while panels (c) and (d) refer to the GSIBs subsample, and
we use August 2007 to distinguish between pre and post crisis periods. Results confirm a
positive association between high βtBW and high returns in the pre crisis sample. Panels
(a) and (c) show that, relative to the larger population, GSIBs tend to have both higher
average betas, and larger returns. This suggests that global banks were systematically
loading more on world risk in the run-up to the financial crisis, and that their behaviour
was delivering larger average returns, compared to the average bank in our sample. The
higher loadings on risk are consistent with the build-up of leverage in the years prior to
the crisis documented in Figure A.2. Furthermore, panels (b) and (d) sort the banks on
the x-axis according to their pre-crisis betas, but report their post crisis returns on the
y axis. The charts show how the institutions that were loading more on global risk pre

We calculate leverage along the lines of Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2012). We use a panel 166 financial
institutions in 20 countries from 2000 to 2010. We identify a subset of 21 large banks who have been
classified as Globally Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs). A complete list of institutions included in
our set is in Table A.4.

Conclusions

This paper establishes the importance of US monetary policy as one of the drivers of the
Global Financial Cycle. First, we show that a single global factor explains an important
share of the common variation of a large cross section of risky asset prices around the
world. Using a simple model of international asset pricing featuring heterogeneous investors, we interpret this global factor as reflective of global market volatility, and the
aggregate degree of risk aversion in global markets. Second, using data covering world
aggregates, we show that US monetary policy shocks induce strong comovements in the
international financial variables that characterize the Global Financial Cycle. In partic-

29

ular, monetary contractions are followed by a significant deleveraging of global financial
intermediaries, a rise in aggregate risk aversion, and a significant contraction in the global
factor in asset prices, global credit, a widening of corporate bond spreads and strong retrenchments of international capital flows. These results also hold for the countries of
our sample with floating exchange rates. This is an important result, as it challenges the
degree of monetary policy sovereignty of open economies, and echoes the claim of Rey
(2013) that the Mundellian trilemma may have really morphed into a dilemma: as long
as capital flows across borders are free, and macroprudential tools are not used, monetary
conditions in any country, even one with a flexible exchange rate, are partly dictated by
the monetary policy of the hegemon (the US). This of course does not mean that exchange
rate regimes do not matter, as Klein and Shambaugh (2013) and Obstfeld (2015) rightly
point out.36 This international transmission mechanism of monetary policy is a priori
consistent with models where financial market imperfections play an important role, for
example via Value-at-Risk constraints. It still remains to be seen, however, whether open
economy extensions of these models would be able to generate a Global Financial Cycle
whose features would match the empirical regularities uncovered in this paper.37

Credit and Banking Data – For Online Publication

A.1

Domestic and Cross-Border Credit

Credit data, both domestic and cross-border, are constructed using data collected and
distributed by the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) databases respectively, for the countries listed in table A.1.

Note: Global Domestic Credit and Global Cross-Border Inflows constructed as the cross sectional sum
of country-specific credit variables. The unit in both plots is Billion USD.

Following Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) we construct National Domestic Credit for
each country as the difference between Domestic Claims to All Sectors and Net Claims
to Central Government reported by each country’s financial institutions; however, we
only consider claims of depository corporations excluding central banks. Specifically,
we refer to the Other Depository Corporation Survey available within the IFS database
and construct Claims to All Sectors as the sum of Claims On Private Sector, Claims
on Public Non Financial Corporations, Claims on Other Financial Corporations and
Claims on State And Local Government; while Net Claims to Central Government are
calculated as the difference between Claims on and Liabilities to Central Government.
This classification was adopted starting from 2001, prior to that date we refer to the
Deposit Money Banks Survey. Raw data are quarterly and expressed in national currency,
we convert them in Billion USD equivalents using end of period exchange rates again
available within the IFS. Whenever there exists a discontinuity between data available
under the old and new classifications we interpolate the missing observations. Global

Note: Countries included in the construction of the Domestic Credit and Cross-Border Credit variables
used throughout the paper. Greece is not included in the computation of Global Domestic Credit due
to poor quality of original national data.

Domestic Credit is finally constructed as the cross-sectional sum of the National Domestic
Credit variables.
To construct the Cross-Border Capital Inflows measures used within the paper we
adopt the definition of Direct Cross-Border Credit in Avdjiev et al. (2012). We use
original data available at the BIS Locational Banking Statistics Database and collected
under External Positions of Reporting Banks vis-à-vis Individual Countries (Table 6).
Data refer to the outstanding amount of Claims to All Sectors and Claims to Non-Bank
Sector in all currencies, all instruments, declared by all BIS reporting countries with
counterparty location being the individual countries in Table A.1. We then construct
Claims to the Banking Sector as the difference between the two categories available.
Original data are available at quarterly frequency in Million USD. Global Inflows are

37

finally calculated as the cross-sectional sum of the national variables. Global domestic
credit and global cross-border capital inflows are plotted in Figure A.1.

A.2

Banking Sector and Individual Banks Leverage data

To construct an aggregate country-level measure of banking sector leverage we follow
Forbes (2012) and build it as the ratio between Claims on Private Sector and Transferable
plus Other Deposits included in Broad Money of depository corporations excluding central
banks. Original data are in national currencies and are taken from the Other Depository
Corporations Survey; Monetary Statistics, International Financial Statistics database.
The classification of deposits within the former Deposit Money Banks Survey corresponds
to Demand, Time, Savings and Foreign Currency Deposits. Using these national data as
a reference, we construct the European Banking Sector Leverage variable as the median
leverage ratio among Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and United Kingdom.

The aggregate Leverage Ratios (defined as Total Assets over Equity) for the Global

constructed as weighted averages of individual banks data. Balance sheet Total Assets
(DWTA) and Shareholders’ Equity (DWSE) are from the Thomson Reuter Worldscope

Note: European Global Systemically Important Banks included in the construction of GSIBs Leverage
Ratios; the last two columns highlight the components of EUR and GDP Leverage respectively.

Datastream database and available at quarterly frequency. Weights are proportional to
Market Capitalisation (WC08001) downloaded from the same source. Details on the
banks included and their characteristics are summarised in Table A.2 below. The aggregated banking sector leverage and the leverage ratio of the European GSIBs are plotted
in Figure A.2.
Figures 11 and A.3 are built using data on individual banks total return indices
excluding dividends taken from Thomson Reuters Worldscope database at quarterly frequency. Data are collected directly from banks balance sheets and Leverage Ratios are
computed as the ratio between Total Assets (DWTA) and Common/Shareholders’ Equity
(DWSE). Total Assets include cash and due from banks, total investments, net loans, customer liability on acceptances (if included in total assets), investment in unconsolidated
subsidiaries, real estate assets, net property, plant and equipment, and other assets. Descriptive statistics for bank level data and a complete list of the institutions included in
the sample are provided in Tables A.3 and A.4 respectively. Although the data source is
different, the calculation follows Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2012).

Dynamic Factor Model for World Risky Asset Prices
– For Online Publication

Let pt be an n-dimensional vector collecting monthly (log) asset price series pi,t , where
pi,t denotes the price for asset i at date t. We assume
pt = ΛFt + ξt .

(B.1)

Ft is an (r × 1) vector of common factors (Ft = [f1,t , . . . , fr,t ]0 ) that capture systematic
sources of variation among prices and are loaded via the coefficients in Λ that determine
how each price series reacts to the common shocks. ξt is a (n × 1) vector of idiosyncratic shocks ξi,t that capture series-specific variability or measurement errors. We allow
elements in ξt to display some degree of autocorrelation while we rule out pairwise correlation between assets assuming that all the co-variation is accounted for by the common
component. Both the common factors and the idiosyncratic terms are assumed to be zero
mean processes.
The factors are assumed to follow a VAR process of order p
Ft = Φ1 Ft−1 + . . . + Φp Ft−p + εt ,

(B.2)

where the autoregressive coefficients are collected in the p matrices Φ1 , . . . , Φp , each of
which is (r ×r); the error term εt is a normally distributed zero mean process with covariance matrix Q. Any residual autocorrelation is captured by the idiosyncratic component
which we assume being a collection of independent univariate autoregressive processes.
In order to distinguish between comovements at different levels of aggregation we
model asset prices such that each series is a function of a global factor, a regional factor
and an idiosyncratic term. We do so by allowing the vector of common shocks to include
both aggregate shocks that affect all series in yt , and shocks that affect many but not all
of them:
pi,t = λi,g ftg + λi,m ftm + ξi,t .
(B.3)
In Eq. (B.3) the common component ΛFt is separated into a global factor (ftg ) and a
regional or market-specific factor (ftm ) which is meant to capture commonalities among
many but not all price series. Each pi,t is thus a function of a global factor loaded by
all the variables in pt , a regional or market-specific factor only loaded by those series in
pt that belong to the (geographical or sector-specific) market m, and of a series-specific
factor.
Such hierarchical structure is imposed via zero restrictions on some of the elements in

45

Λ. In particular, we assume the common component to be partitioned into a global and
several regional factors. To this aim, let the variables in yt be such that it is possible to
univocally allocate them in B different blocks or regions and, without loss of generality,
assume that they are ordered according to the specific block they refer to such that
yt = [yt1 , yt2 , . . . , ytB ]0 . Eq. (B.1) can be rewritten as


(B.4)

Moreover, further restrictions are imposed on the coefficient matrices in Eq. (B.2) such
that Φi (i, . . . , p) and Q are block diagonal.
The model in Eq. (B.1-B.2) can be cast in state space form and the unknowns consistently estimated via Maximum Likelihood (Doz et al., 2011; Engle and Watson, 1981;
Reis and Watson, 2010; Bańbura et al., 2011). The algorithm is initialized using principal
component estimates of the factors that are proven to provide a good approximation of
the common factors when the cross sectional dimension is large.38 We estimate the model
on the price series in (log) difference and obtain the factors via cumulation.39 We set
the number of lags in the factors VAR (p) to be equal to 1. We fit to the data a model
with one global and one factor per block/market; the parametrization is motivated by
the results in Table B.2.
We fit the model to a vast collection of prices of different risky assets. The geographical
areas covered are North America (US and Canada), Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico), Europe (Euro Area, UK, Switzerland and the Scandinavian Countries),
Asia Pacific (Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan), and Australia. The set of
commodities considered does not include precious metals. The time span covered is from
January 1990 to December 2012. In order to select the series that are included in the
global set we proceed as follows: first, for each market, we pick a representative market
index (i.e. S&P) and all of its components as of the end of 2012, we then select those
that allow us to cover at least 80% of the cross sectional observations by the beginning of
1990, and such that by 1995 we reach a 95% coverage.40 The procedure allows us to build
38

Forni et al. (2000); Bai and Ng (2002); Stock and Watson (2002b,a) among others.
Let x˜t ≡ ∆xt denote the first difference for any variable xt , then consistent estimates of the common
factors in Ft can be obtained by cumulating the factors estimated from the stationary, first-differenced
Pt
Pt ˆ
model: p˜t = ΛF̃t + ξ˜t . In particular, F̂t = s=2 Fˆ˜s and ξˆt = s=2 ξ˜s . Bai and Ng (2004) show that F̂t
is a consistent estimate of Ft up to a scale and an initial condition F0 .

a final dataset with an overall cross-sectional dimension of n = 858. The composition is
reported in Table B.1, where each category (in columns) corresponds to one of the blocks
(m) within the structure imposed.
Although all series included in the set are priced in US dollars, we verify that the
shape of the global factor is not influenced by this choice by estimating the same model
on price series in their local currencies (i.e. the currency in which the assets are originally
traded). The resulting global factor (not shown) is very similar to the one constructed
from the dollar-denominated set both in terms of overall shape and of peaks and troughs
that perfectly coincide throughout the time span considered. Intuitively, the robustness of
the estimate of the global factor with respect to currency transformations comes directly
from the structure imposed in Eq. (B.3). The blocks/markets structure imposed roughly
coincides with currency areas, therefore this aspect is likely to be largely captured by the
regional factors (see Table B.1).

B.1

The Number of Factors

To choose the number of global factors we use a number of criteria and tests, collected
in Table B.2. The table reports the percentage of variance that is explained by the i-th
eigenvalue (in decreasing order) of both the covariance matrix and the spectral density
matrix, the information criteria in Bai and Ng (2002), where the residual variance of the
idiosyncratic component is minimized subject to a penalty function increasing in r, and
the test developed in Onatski (2009), where the null of r − 1 factors is tested against
the alternative of r common factors. The largest eigenvalue alone, in both the time and
frequency domain, accounts for about 60% of the variability in the data in the longer set
and about a fourth of the variation in the shorter, but more heterogeneous set; similarly,
the IC criteria reach their minimum when one factor is used, and the overall picture is
confirmed by the the p-values for the Onatski test.
work with a fully balanced panel, we want to ensure that none of the categories included in the set is
overrepresented at any point in time.

Bayesian VAR – For Online Publication

Let Yt denote a set of n endogenous variables, Yt = [y1t , . . . , yN t ]0 , with n potentially
large, and consider for it the following VAR(p):
Yt = c + A1 Yt−1 + . . . + Ap Yt−p + ut .

(C.1)

In Eq. (C.1) c is an (n × 1) vector of intercepts, the n-dimensional Ai (i = 1, . . . , p)
matrices collect the autoregressive coefficients, and ut is a normally distributed error
term with zero mean and variance E(ut u0t ) = Σ. We estimate the VAR using standard
macroeconomic priors (Litterman, 1986; Kadiyala and Karlsson, 1997; Sims and Zha,
1998; Doan et al., 1983; Sims, 1993); in particular, we use a Normal-Inverse Wishart
prior for the VAR coefficients. The Normal-Inverse Wishart prior takes the following

48

form:
Σ ∼ W −1 (Ψ, ν)

(C.2)

β|Σ ∼ N (b, Σ ⊗ Ω)

(C.3)

where β is a vector collecting all the VAR parameters, i.e. β ≡ vec([c, A1 , . . . , Ap ]0 ). The
degrees of freedom of the Inverse-Wishart are set such that the mean of the distribution
exists and are equal to ν = n + 2, Ψ is diagonal with elements ψi which are chosen to be
a function of the residual variance of the regression of each variable onto its own first p
lags. More specifically, the parameters in Eq. (C.2) and Eq. (C.3) are chosen to match
the moments for the distribution of the coefficients in Eq. (C.1) defined by the Minnesota
priors:

E[(Ai )jk ] =


δ

j

0

i = 1, j = k
otherwise

Var[(Ai )jk ] =


 λ22
i



2
λ2 σk
2
i σj2

j=k

(C.4)

otherwise,

where (Ai )jk denotes the element in row (equation) j and column (variable) k of the
coefficients matrix A at lag i (i = 1, . . . , p). When δj = 1 the random walk prior is
strictly imposed on all variables; however, for those variables for which this prior is not
suitable we set δj = 0 as in Bańbura et al. (2010). On the right hand side of Eq. (C.4),
the variance of the elements in Ai is assumed to be proportional to the (inverse of the)
square of the lag (i2 ), and to the relative variance of the variables.
λ is the hyperparameter that governs the overall tightness of the priors. We follow
Giannone et al. (2015) and treat the λ as an additional model parameter which we
estimate in the spirit of hierarchical modelling.
