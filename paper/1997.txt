The Ins and Outs of Unemployment: The Ins Win

ABSTRACT

This paper develops a framework for analyzing unemployment in terms of
variations in the nt.imber and distribution of

people becoming unemployed and in

individual probabilities of leaving unemployment.

Contrary to the emphasis on

exit probabilities in the recent macroeconomics literature, we present
empirical evidence in support of the proposition that changes in the size and
distribution of the inflow Into unemployment are the primary determinant of

the unemployment rate. Instead of falling at the beginning of a recession,
the outflow rate rises (with a lag) in response to the increased inflows which

drive the recession. In contrast to normal unemployment, cyclical unemployment is concentrated in groups with low normal exit probabilities; so the
observed procyclical variation in the average exit probability may largely he
explained by predictable distributional effects.

To understand changes in the unemployment rate, should we concentrate on
the factors that determine inflows into unemployment or outflows from it? Or,

are both flow concepts statistical ephemera without any substantial use? This
paper attempts to answer those questions and does so in a surprising way: The
main proximate determinant of changes in the unemployment rate is variations

in the level and distribution of inflows into unemployment. Since the prob—
ability of leaving unemployment is primarily determined by the characteristics
of those becoming unemployed and is little affected by the business cycle,
outflows from unemployment and hence the actual changes in the unemployment
rate are primarily determined by the inflows.

Figure 1 provides preliminary evidence in support of the startling
hypothesis that the unemployment rate is determined primarily by the inflows.

The upper line labeled u is the unemployment rate. The solid line labeled

outflow from unemployment in the same way. The change in the unemployment

rate over a quarter is three times the gap between the 4 and w lines.'
Statistical analysis reported below confirms the visual impression that

that the onset of a recession is characterized by a sharp increase in 4

followed quickly by an increase in w. Unemployment rises so long as the

increase in w lags behind the increase in

This rise In w at the beginning of recessions is inconsistent with the
predictions of the standard expectational—error/search paradigm in which a
recession is characterized by fooling workers into declining job offers which
they would take if they were aware of the decline in the offer distribution

available. This characterization of the business cycle has played a fundamental role in the macroeconomics literature during the last 20 years and is
the primary explanation of business cycles provided in many current
intermediate macroeconomics texts (e.g., Dornbusch and Fischer 1984, Gordon

1984). Yet, Figure 1 and our subsequent analysis suggests that business—cycle
analysts have placed too much emphasis on workers making expectational errors.
Instead, we contend that increases in the unemployment rate primarily reflect
more people passing through that state, not each individual spending an

In our (1985) paper we developed data which showed that the average

paper, we extend our heterogeneity hypothesis which relates
average probability to the much larger representation of
cyclical as opposed to normal unemployment.

We demonstrate in this paper that

taking into account these distributional effects

on average probabilities

tends to strengthen the result that it is the level and distribution of the

inflows that dominates movements in unemployment.
A useful analogy which clarifies our viewpoint is to think of the number
of people traveling by air at a given moment. At major holidays, this number

rises both because more people are

making trips and their trips cover longer

distances on average. While there may be some increase in the time required to
make a certain trip, this is secondary to the number and type of trips as a
determinant of the number flying at any given time. Even for the average duration of trips, variation in the average length of trips may be a more important
explanation than variation in the average duration of a given type of trip.

Our results here do not show that individual outflow probabilities

are constant. We do show that controlling for such

to explain persistent deviations of the probability of escape from unemployment from its normal value, for example duration

various explanations for such persistent deviations other than recognizing the
importance of heterogeneity.

values over the cycle for

equilibrium or disequilibrium reasons.
Our results bring us closer to the viewpoint of Liliert (1982) than in our

(1985) paper. Variations in the rate of industrial change do appear to be an
important determinant of the level and distribution of inflows and hence of

the unemployment rate. Much future research by us and others is needed to
understand exactly what determines the level and distribution of inflows, but
the point of this paper is that research focusing on the determinants of the
inflows is important if we are to answer Mitchell's (1951) question What

Happens During Business Cycles? Our working hypothesis is that such research
will indicate the importance of cyclical factors (structural change is
concentrated in recessions), the real exchange rate (which shifts resources
between the tradable and nontradable goods sectors), and wars (which greatly
reduce the number of bankruptcies, plant closings, and permanent layoffs).
The first section of this paper develops the analytics of unemployment
dynamics and shows that the persistent, hump—shaped fluctuations in unemployment can be explained by these dynamics without necessary recourse to

persistent expectational errors. The next section applies these concepts in
the empirical analysis of both aggregate data and data disaggregated by

individual characteristics. In our final section we summarize the work and
propose a program for future research.

hope to develop data and techniques which would permit us

to pursue that strategy. Given the currently available data, we are
pleasantly surprised that our model is able to explain changes in total
unemployment so well as it does.

LA. An Unemployment Accounting Paradigm
Let us begin by arranging people into groups indexed by i such that
each individual in a particular group has the same probability in any given
month of leaving unemployment if they are unemployed at the beginning of the

month. This probability may change from month to month with business conditions but it changes in the same way for everyone within the group.4

3Layoff unemployment is used here to refer to those unemployed expecting
to be recalled to their previous job while search unemployment refers to all
others. A person counted as layoff unemployed this month could remain so next
month or become employed at his previous job, employed at a new job, search
unemployed, or out—of—the labor force. For reasons to be discussed below, it
likely that the probability of recall from layoff unemployment is affected
more by cyclical variables than is the probability that a particular
individual will leave search unemployment.

is

41n our (1985) paper we concentrated on two such groups: a high—turnover
and low turnover group. Results reported below suggest at least four major
groupings: temporary—layoff unemployed, loosely—attached (to the labor force)
workers who have a low probability of getting a job and high probability of
leaving the labor force, strongly—attached high—turnover workers who have a
high probability of getting a job but a very low probability of leaving the
labor force, and strongly—attached low—turnover workers who have a low probability of getting a job (on the rare occasions that they are search unemployed)
and a very low probability of leaving the labor force. To fit the strict
definition of a group in the text, the number of distinct groups would have to
be multiplied by a large number.

Identity (4) is unwieldy and further simplification is obviously needed in

moving from tautology to theory. We propose a decomposition of movements in
unemployment into those due to variations in inflows holding exit probabilities constant and those due to variations in exit probabilities holding inflows
constant.

I.B. Unemployment Rate Dynamics without Persistent Expectational Errors
Suppose that unemployed individuals are well informed about the state of
the labor market so that the expected offer distribution differs from the

actual offer distribution only by serially uncorrelated errors. In this
environment, it can be demonstrated (see, e.g., Lippman and McCall 1986,
Burdett and Ondrich 1985) that fluctuations in a representative searcher's
probability of finding a job will be serially uncorrelated as well (at least

to a first approximation). The underlying intuition for this result is as
follows. An anticipated shift in the offer distribution will primarily result
in rational searchers altering their reservation wage. Whether the new
reservation wage involves a higher or lower probability of accepting a job
depends on the exact nature of the shift, but the presumption is that any such

9

change will be of second order in magnitude.5
Under this well—informed worker hypothesis, it is reasonable to assume
that a representative searcher's outflow probability

is roughly constant

over time except for random fluctuations. For purposes of empirical testing,
we use an extreme characterization and identify this hypothesis with a constant
for all individuals at all moments in time.6

This allows us to address

the interesting empirical issue of how much of the variation in observed
unemployment can be explained without resorting to any variation in individual
in

'S.
Note that under this hypothesis the rate at which firms make

little

offers has

if any effect on the level of unemployment because the reservation wage

adjusts as the offer rate changes. The oniy influence of firms on the current
rate of unemployment is through the rate at which different types of people
(grouped by their constant
in1)

entered

unemployment in the past. For govern-

ment to influence cyclical unemployment, it must work on the rate at which
people enter unemployment per se, not the demand of firms for new workers.7

5Note that Burdett and Ondrich (1985) have developed sufficient
conditions to sign the change in in associated with a shift in the offer
distribution. However, these sufficient conditions involve technical conditions about the nature of the offer distribution which are not motivated by
empirical observation. Further, even If the effect can be signed, it still
appears that it is a second order effect relative to the change in the
reservation wage itself.
6We recognize that asymmetric information may also play an important role
in the determination of layoff rates by firms (Grossman and Hart, 1983). Here
we concentrate on Its alleged role in the determination of

7kgain we suspect that this statement is more nearly correct for search
than for layoff unemployment. Implicitly we are treating an individual as in

switch to an equality sign to remind us that equation (5) has theoretical

In our (1985) paper we emphasized that predictable changes in the
composition of the unemployed over the business cycle could account for some
of the observed movement in the observed average or aggregate outflow probab—

movements are explained

entirely by heterogeneity since individual outflow probabilities are constant:

The large theoretical and empirical literature (e.g., Heckman and Borjas

explaining individual differences in unemployment durations provides considerable guidance for the factors likely to cause variations in

IT1. Worker

characteristics such as age, sex, race, industry, occupation, education, reason
of unemployment have all been shown to he important in microeconomic

contexts. Our innovation is to attempt to explain aggregate movements in
unemployment with such heterogeneity playing a fundamental role. The
difficulty of course is to account for as much of the heterogeneity as possible

in the aggregate data.
Business Cycles
In our empirical work we find it useful

to distinguish among short—run

fluctuations in unemployment which we term business cycles, intermediate—run
movements associated with the pace of structural change in the economy, and
longer—term trends associated with gradual changes in the demographic makeup

of the labor force.9 We are interested in

demonstrating that the simple

partial adjustment model which equation (5) implicitly imposes on each group

can in fact explain the type of business cycles which are observed in the
United States.

Suppose that there is a constant normal rate

which would otherwise occur are accelerated if inventories are high and
postponed if inventories are low. However, beyond this
bunching phenomenon, we
see protracted periods in which the pace of structural change is particularly
high or low. As discussed below, we associate these
intermediate trends with
general changes In tastes and technology, wars, and adjustment to changes in

It is clear that uncorrelated f1 shocks cannot produce the sort of
business cycles with which macroeconomists have traditionally concerned

themselves.'0 With serially correlated

shocks, unemployment falls after

the first month rather than first building up for 6 to 9 months as in the

archetypal hump—shaped business cycle. However, recent Inventory based models
of persistence (e.g., linder and Fischer 1981, Topel 1982 and Haltiwanger and
Maccini 1985) suggest that the buffer stock role of Inventories may help
explain how serially uncorrelated shocks translate into serially correlated

inflows into unemployment. In particular, if firms set prices for longer
periods than our length of observation (a month), then a single period mistake

can lead to growing cyclical inventories over a period of months. Moreover,
firms may spread their adjustment to cyclical inventories over time or indeed

he hit by an aggregate demand shock at different times. Along these lines, it
can be demonstrated that (e.g., Haltiwanger and Maccini 1985) that higher
initial inventories in any given period will lead to a higher probability of

both permanent and temporary layoffs in the period. Hence, persistent and
abnormally high inventories can lead to persistently high probabilities of

permanent and temporary layoffs for several periods. Suppose then that

cyclical Inflows f1 can be described by a first—order autoregressive

are substantially correlated and the probability of leaving unemployment is not
too high, a single period innovation results in a hump—shaped business cycle.
Our

empirical

work will aim to see whether such values are plausible for the

groups most affected by fluctuations in unemployment over the business cycle.
The process underlying Figure 2 can be best understood by reference to

equation (8). The change in the number unemployed is the difference between

the cyclical inflow (f) and the outflow probability times lagged cyclical
unemployment (xjsj.1). In Figure 3, these are combined to derive the
adjustment path of unemployment in response to an innovation in

surprisingly well at explaining the data as discussed in Section II.

the extra outflow just offsets the (somewhat attenuated) increased

inflow and unemployment reaches its peak. Thereafter the declining cyclical
inflow is dominated by the outflows and unemployment gradually returns to
normal.

The geometric decline of f1

reflects the assumed first—order

autoregressive processes. Other processes would modify the diagram in obvious
ways. For example, a persistent increase in plant closings relative to normal
(such as might occur during the shift of resources consequent upon a sustained

appreciation of the dollar) might result in a sustained increase in

such as in Figure 4. Unemployment rises asymptotically to a point where the
increased outflows just balance the increased inflows. Unemployment will
remain at this unusually high level so long as the abnormal inflows continue.

We prefer to differentiate such sustained, intermediate—run changes in

unemployment from the business cycle, however. A business cycle is necessarily transitory and self—limiting while such structural shifts and accompanying
Increased unemployment rates can persist over periods measured in years.'3

I.C Unemployment Rate Dynamics with Persistent Expectational Errors
An alternative to the well—informed worker hypothesis is the view that
workers make persistent expectational errors, particularly over the business

cycle. This leads to the characterization of the business cycle found in many
of the leading intermediate macroeconomic texts. That is, when a business
cycle slump hits, workers make persistent expectational errors which causes

the duration and therefore the rate of unemployment to increase. An extreme

13We shall see below that inflows are abnormally low during wars as few
firms go bankrupt and few Individuals are forced to change jobs. This effect
seems to dwarf the effect of draft—eligible young males being either drafted
or locked into draft—exempt activities.

view of this persistent expectational error hypothesis is that most of the

Unfortunately

the decomposition of cyclical unemployment into one

component which can be attributed to movements in group inflows and another
component which can be attributed to movements in group outflow probabilities

is imperfect in several ways. First, it is not exhaustive and a remainder
term reflecting interaction effects of the two sorts of movements might be

substantial. Second, to the extent that available data restrict us to look at
groups which are still heterogeneous with respect to individual

values

(even though more homogeneous than the labor force as a whole), we will
attribute too little explanatory power to movements in inflows and too much to

movements in individual probabilities.'5 This is particularly true if the

marginal n values associated with f1 differ from average ir1 values
associated with f1. (Suppose that group i has a substantial but constant
component of loosely attached churriers" in—and—out of the labor market, but

marginal inflows relate to firmly attached, low—turnover workers.) We view
these limitations as cautions in applying the theory to the exploratory
results reported in the remainder of the paper.

'5Basically variations in inflows will induce via sorting the type of
effects implicit in equation (5) and explored at length in our (1985) paper.

It.A Measurement
To measure unemployment flows, we use the net flow data from the BLS

Current Population Survey.'6 The measurement of

flow data follow the procedures identified in our earlier paper. To briefly
recount the procedure, we have:
(14)

it =

(15)

=

1 -

(st_s4)/s11

n

where s1 is the number in group I unemployed in a given month,

is

the number in group I who have been unemployed "0—4" weeks, and

is the

number in the labor force. Note that the inflow level for

is simply given by s4. Further, the outflow rate,

1Ts1/n

where

group 1, f,
is given by

represents the growth—adjusted probability of exiting

unemployment. Finally, the unemployment rate for group i is simply

s1/n.

For our analysis in Section I1.B on the aggregate behavior of the inflows
and outflows, we use monthly data on

s,

and

from 1948:1 to

1985:1. For our disaggregated analysis in Section Il.C, computation of

and it by demographic group, by reason of unemployment, by industry, and by

16 alternative would be to use the gross flow data. However, the gross
flow data are not published on a regular basis and are known to have some
serious measurement problems. Nevertheless, it would be of considerable
interest to examine the gross flow data In this context which we plan to do in
future research.

ILB Aggregate Analysis of ii,

4),

w and u

We begin our empirical analysis by examining the aggregate data to provide
an initial set of stylized facts on the inflows to and the outflows from
unemployment and their relative importance in explaining overall movements in

unemployment. Our theoretical discussion above indicates that both the level
and the distribution of the flows across heterogeneous groups should be

important in this context. As we will see in Section 1I.C, heterogeneity is
very important. However, for the moment we will focus on the aggregate flows
ignoring heterogeneity issues. This is intended to establish the broad
patterns in the aggregate flows which will be analyzed in detail in the
remainder of the paper.

Our empirical analysis of the aggregate inflows and the outflows begins
with a simple characterization of the time series properties of these

measures. In Table 1, we report F—tests from bivariate vector autoregressions
of

and

These results indicate that lagged values of each series are

important for explaining the movements in the series itself. More importantly,

we find that lagged values of 4 are important in explaining current movements in

and lagged values of

are important for explaining current

movements in 4, however, the F—statistic in the latter case is the smallest
of those reported. We do not wish to place any causal interpretation on these
results, but they do re—enforce the visual impression from Figure 1 that

'71n this paper, we use data that has not been seasonally adjusted.
Given that we are measuring inflows and outflows from unemployment, use of
such data makes sense. However the exact role of seasonality needs to be
analyzed carefully at a later date with particular attention played to the
covariance between seasonal and cyclical factors.

In Table 2, univariate representations of

both series, we fit a relatively simple multiplicative seasonal model with

ARIMA(l,O,l) for both the seasonal and the non—seasonal specifications. The
purpose of this is not to necessarily produce white noise residuals but rather

to examine how a relatively simple, interpretable process fits the data. From
the results, we observe that all coefficients are highly significant. However,
the reported q—statistics indicate that there is residual unexplained autocor—

relations in both

the signs of the coefficients

and the reported standard errors indicate that there is significant positive
autocorrelation in both

and

The presence of significant persistence

is obviously associated with the overall observed persistence

in the unemployment rate. In our earlier paper, we suggested that persistence
in aggregate

and

can be explained without resorting to persistent

expectational errors (at least on the part of workers). Specifically, persistence in aggregate

is at least partially due to heterogeneity and the

resulting sorting that occurs over the cycle. Further, persistence in

is

associated with the buffer stock role of inventories over the cycle. These two
hypotheses will be considered further below.

Recall that our primary emphasis in this paper is to demonstrate that the
main proximate determinant of changes in the unemployment rate is variations in

the level and distribution of inflows into unemployment. Since we are neglecting measurement of heterogeneity in this section, we cannot directly examine

the role of the distribution of the inflows but rather only the level. We
close this section by examining a variance decomposition of the overall move-

ment of the unemployment rate. Specifically, we are interested in how much of
the variance in overall unemployment can he explained by the constant

actual level (in both cases,

takes on its actual level). For the vari-

ance decompositions reported in Table 3, we use u in the first month of
1948 to initiate the simulation and then perform dynamic simulations under

these two alternative hypotheses. Two sets of numbers are reported in Table
3. In column (1) of the first row we report the ratio of the variance of the

simulated u with it constant to the variance of the actual u. If we
write u as the sum of the simulated value of Ut plus a residual term,
then the variance of the actual Ut is equal to the sum of the simulated

Ut

variance plus the variance of the residual plus twice the covariance of the

simulated Ut and the residual. These last two terms are reported in columns
(2) and (3) as a fraction of the total variance of u. In the second row, we
repeat the same procedure except we use the simulated Ut with

constant.

These results indicate that, even without accounting for heterogeneity,

'81n the empirical analysis that follows, we use the unemployment rate
and the associated inflow and outflow rates rather than the levels which were
used in the theoretical discussion. Since a substantial portion of the
increase in the unemployment level and the inflow level is due to the growth
of the labor force, using levels in our analysis will attribute too much of
the variance to the inflow level. The use of the unemployment rate normalizes
for the size of the labor force.

model. We also see that

the residuals and associated covariances are quite important. Given that
these results are based upon aggregate data ignoring heterogeneity and thus
the distribution of the inflows, these results provide preliminary support for

the primary hypothesis stated in the introduction. Namely, that the main
proximate determinant of changes in unemployment is variations in the inflows

into unemployment. We will now explore the role of heterogeneity in this
context. As will become apparent, the results on heterogeneity are of
interest but we are severely constrained in this effort by the limitations
imposed by the available data.

II.C. Heterogeneity
The preliminary empirical results presented in Section II.B assumed that
workers were homogeneous with respect to the rate of inflow into unemployment,

and with respect to the probability of leaving unemployment, ii.

However, in our theoretical discussion in Section I we noted that significant
heterogeneity in

would imply that variations in the distribution of the

Inflows are important for explaining movements in the unemployment rate. In
the analysis reported in this section we investigate sources of the heterogen-

eity in it

and

•it• We then use the identified heterogeneity to examine

the hypothesis that both the level and distribution of the inflows are
fundamental for explaining movements in unemployment.

Table 5 shows a breakdown of the labor force by reason of unemployment.
The probability of exiting unemployment is highest for those on temporary layoff

(except for females) and lowest for those permanently laid off. Both females
and teens have a high inflow rate into non—layoff unemployment. Prime—aged
males enter into all three unemployment states at approximately equal rates.

Given that these preliminary results do indicate that there is significant

heterogeneity in Wft,

it

remains to be seen whether there is significant

variation in the distribution of the inflows over time and over the cycle. In
Tables 8—10 we present the correlations of the overall unemployment rate with
the unemployment shares for various breakdowns of the labor force.

The

numbers in Table 8 are quite provocative. The groups which tend to increase
their share of unemployment when there is an overall increase in the
unemployment rate are male workers aged 20—34, female workers of the same age,

and females aged 55—64. Popular belief is that teenagers bear the brunt of
unemployment, but this table demonstrates that non—teenage young workers who
are relatively inexperienced but probably beginning to be strongly attached to
the labor force feel the impact most severely, and that experienced workers

seem to be relatively protected. It is important to note that these are
correlations of shares and so all groups may in fact be increasing in numbers

of unemployed and unemployment rates. Those groups with positive correlations
are suffering a disproportionate impact of the business cycle. Table 9
presents similar numbers for a partition of the labor force by age, sex, and

reason of unemployment. This table indicates that increases in the uneruploy—

ment rate come through increases in layoffs. The strongest positive

correlation is for permanent layoffs of prime—aged men.

Temporary layoffs of

the same group also play a strong role and another channel for adjustment is

permanent layoffs of females. Note that the share of temporary layoffs of
females and layoffs of teens have a weak negative correlation with the

unemployment rate. Table 10 reports the same correlations for industry and
occupation. The industries that are thought to be cyclically sensitive are

those which are disportionately affected —

mining,

durable manufacturing,

construction, and transportation. Craft workers and operatives are the
occupation categories that exhibit a positive correlation between unemployment

shares and the overall unemployment rate. The story one is tempted to tell
from these three tables is that the business cycle has a disproportionate
impact on industries whose labor force is comprised primarily of blue collar

workers. Typically the adjustment is made through layoffs, and given the
heavily unionized nature of these industries, the youngest workers are first

laid off. The older a worker is, the more insulated he is from the business
cycle. Thus, we see young workers who are just becoming attached to the labor
force to be the most vulnerable to the business cycle. On an age—sex breakdown alone, this runs counter to the intuition that we expect to see a
preponderance of low—it workers when the overall unemployment rate is high.

However, if we look at the other breakdowns —— by reason, by occupation, and

by industry —

it

is the low—n workers who have a positive correlation of

unemployment share with overall unemployment rate.
As always, however, correlations do not give us any information about
causality. We would expect to see a larger share of low—it workers if the
recession had a more severe impact on sectors of the economy where those

laborers were employed. That is the story we just told. However, as we
showed in our (1985) paper, if there were heterogeneity in

and if an

initial perturbation in
inflow rates

resulted in an equiproportionate increase in

for all groups, as the unemployment rate began to return to

its natural level, low—w workers would be a larger fraction of the labor force
since they take longer to return to normal levels of unemployment.

Thus,

differential impact of the business cycle is not necessary to cause the

correlations that we saw in the last three tables. Nevertheless, independent
of causality considerations, we have seen that there exists significant
heterogeneity in inflow and outflow rates as well as significant variations in
the shares over time.

We now attempt to use this disaggregated data to consider the primary

hypothesis of this paper. That is, it is primarily variations In the level
and distribution of the inflows which account for the variation in the

unemployment rate. Unfortunately, we do not have this data for a long time
period, nor do we have cross tabulations simultaneously breaking down the data
by age, sex, reason, Industry, and occupation.

Our initial analysis using the disaggregated data does not attempt to use
all of the information simultaneously but rather uses each breakdown

independently. These results are reported in Table 11. Following the same
methodology discussed in Section II.'B, we ran simulations of disaggregated

unemployment rates with the disaggregated data holding

iT

and

constant in turn, aggregating by appropriate labor force shares, and then

doing a variance decomposition of the movements in the unemployment rate. In
the leftmost column of Table 11 we note the type of heterogeneity assumed in

each of the separate simulations. These results indicate that the variance
decomposition depends critically on the source of the heterogeneity. We do
find that the variation in the level and distribution of the inflows is the
primary determinant of variations in unemployment for temporary and permanent

However, when

by reason is not taken into account then it appears that variations in the

outflow rate are relatively more important. While this may appear puzzling,
this is precisely what the constant
IT1

hypothesis predicts if there is

significant heterogeneity which is not taken into account. The reported

values for the ,'s by reason and the fluctuations of shares by reason over
the cycle indicate that accounting for variation in the composition of
unemployment by reason is an important source of heterogeneity.

Since the

age—sex, industry, and occupation decompositions do not take unemployment by
reason into account, it is not surprising that the constant

1T hypothesis

does relatively worse under these sources of heterogeneity.2
The results in Table 11 take heterogeneity into account, but only in a

limited fashion. To take into account all of the available information on
heterogeneity, we pursue the following strategy. Recall that aggregate i
and aggregate

are determined by:

20The reason that we separate out these by reason categories is that
aggregation of the simulated values by reason involves labor force shares and
obviously labor force shares by reason are relatively ill defined. For
example, the share of the labor force that are temporarily laid off is ill
defined compared to, say, the share of the labor force who are 16—19 males.
21Duration dependence may also be a source of deviations of

from

its natural level. A large statistical literature has been developed
regarding the observable distinction between unobserved heterogeneity and
state dependence (Hecknian and Singer, 1984). Our data does not allow such a
distinction.

Equations (17) and (18) indicate that variations in aggregate

it

and

4) will

depend on both variations in unemployment shares and labor force shares,

respectively, as well as factors that induce variations in individual r arid

for aggregate
variables for

it

and

4) along these lines. In particular, as explanatory

ir we include lagged unemployment shares by age—sex, by reason

of unemployment, by industry, and by occupation and we include a 12 'nonth dis-

tributed lag of innovations En the inventory—sales ratio to capture cyclical

variations in the individual ,r1's. Similarly, as explanatory variables for
4) we include labor force shares by age—sex, industry, and occupation and the

distributed lag of innovations in the inventory/sales ratio. For the sake of
brevity, these results are not reported here. However, note that we find that
the share variables are significant for explaining variations in aggregate
and

4),

it

whereas the distributed lag on Inventory/sales innovations are not.22

We then used the estimated coefficients from these regressions to produce
estimates of

it and

4) that would vary solely due to variations in the

22That the coefficients on the distributed lag on inventory/sales
innovations are insignificant as a group is somewhat puzzling since it
contrasts with the results reported in our (1985) paper. However, in that
paper, we did not utilize the detailed breakdowns of unemployment by age, sex,
reason, industry and occupation and as such w were able to use a data set for
a much longer time period (1954:8 to 1983:12). Moreover, we used seasonally
adjusted data in that paper in the equivalent regressions (at least partly
because the inventory/sales data are available only on a seasonally adjusted
basis.) In this paper, we again use seasonally adjusted inventory/sales data
but seasonally unadjusted unemployment and labor force series for the regression results (as well as all of the other results) reported in the text.
Preliminary regression analysis using seasonally adjusted it's and 's as
dependent variables indicates that this is probably the source of the discrepancy. That is, we find that using the same period but seasonally adjusted
data yields coefficients on the distributed lag on inventory/sales innovations
that are significant at the 0.001 level. A complete analysis of the role of
seasonality in this context is beyond the scope of this paper but is obviously
worth exploring in future research.

composition of unemployment and of the labor force, but not due to variations

and

in individual it1

c1. using these predicted values of

it

and

based

upon share variations alone, we simulated unemployment in two ways in a manner

similar to that used above. That is, we first simulated
actual

and the predicted

it

unemployment using

based upon share variations alone and then we

simulated unemployment using actual

it

and the predicted

based upon the

share variations alone. tn this manner, we have incorporated all of the
available information on heterogeneity to predict how unemployment would vary
for constant

and how unemployment would vary for constant

q1.

The resulting variance decompositions from these simulations are
reported

in Table 12. We find that most of the variance of the actual unemployment
rate can be accounted for by the constant

it

model.

That is, approximately

90% of the total variance in unemployment can be explained by variations in

the level and distribution of the inflows. It is of course interesting that
the constant

simulated unemployment rate can explain close to 60% of the

total variance in unemployment. However, this is not inconsistent with the
hypothesis that It is primarily the level and the distribution of the inflows

that explains unemployment. We know from the regression results that
variations In aggregate

ii

are influenced significantly by variations in the

unemployment shares. Since the constant
the actual aggregate

it

simulated unemployment rate uses

values, this implies that the distribution of the

inflows and the resulting variation in unemployment shares plays a significant
role in helping explain the total variance with the constant

simulated

unemployment rate. Overall, these results provide substantial support for the
hypothesis that the main proximate determinant of unemployment is variations
in the level and distribution of inflows into unemployment.

Concluding Remarks

Much of the emphasis in explaining unemployment in the macroeconomics
literature has focused on the role of expectational errors by workers.

In

this paper, we develop an unemployment accounting paradigm that allows us to
quantify how much of the variance in unemployment can be accounted for by the

expectational error hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the emphasis on
expectational errors by workers has been misplaced. We find that most of the
variation in unemployment can be explained by variations in the level and
distribution of the inflows into unemployment, while assuming that individual

outflow rates are constant. We point out that constant individual outflow
rates is precisely the result one would expect from job search theory with

well informed workers. Further, we use recent inventory based models of
persistence to suggest that even in the face of relatively constant individual
outflow rates one may still expect to observe persistent cyclical variations
in inflow rates.

Our results are more suggestive than conclusive but they do indicate

fruitful directions for future research. We see four main goals for future

research: (a) Extend our ability to differentiate between unobserved
hetrogeneiry and persistent deviations in individual

values from their

normal levels. (b) Develop models to explain the disaggregated behavior of
values. These models should in principle provide structural linkages to
changes in tastes and technology, monetary and fiscal policy, exchange rate

movements, and wars. As we showed in our theoretical development, a constant
variable

shaped

model can go a long way towards capturing typical hump—

cyclical movements in the unemployment rate. Thus, theoretical and

empirical models that explain persistent deviations in inflow rates will be
quite fruitful in understanding unemployment rate dynamics over the cycle.

(c) Develop models to explain the residual movements in

U they prove

significant. (d) Combine these results to produce a structural model which
improves our ability to understand and forecast movements in aggregate and
disaggregated unemployment rates.
