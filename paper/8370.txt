1. Introduction and background
In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in whether income inequality is a health
hazard in the sense that individuals are less healthy in places where income is more unequally
distributed. The strongest advocate of the income inequality hypothesis has been Richard
Wilkinson (1992), (1996), (2000), who has put forward a variety of evidence, from individual,
area, cross-country, and time-series data. A survey of the subsequent debate over this evidence is
given in Deaton (2001b). In this paper, we are concerned with one of the most prominent of these
relationships, the ecological association between income inequality and mortality across states
and cities in the United States. One version of this correlation is shown in Figure 1 below, which
plots (directly) age-adjusted all-cause mortality against the gini coefficient of per adult-equivalent income; the District of Columbia is included and, although it has both higher mortality and
higher inequality than any state, it lies on the regression line. (The definitions of these and other
data are given in the next section.) The positive correlation between income inequality and
mortality across the US states was first shown in studies by Kaplan et al (1996) and Kennedy,
Kawachi and Prothrow-Stith (1996a, b). Lynch, Kaplan and Pamuk (1998) reproduced the
correlation using data from 282 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in 1990, finding that the
loss of life from income inequality “is comparable to the combined loss of life from lung cancer,
diabetes, motor vehicle crashes, HIV infection, suicide, and homicide in 1995.” These, and other
related studies, are collected in Kawachi, Kennedy, and Wilkinson (1999).
In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the connection between income inequality and
mortality across states and MSAs, with particular attention to the effects of race as a potential
confounder. That the spatial link between income inequality and mortality might be spurious is
1

suggested by several studies in the literature. Most recently, Mellor and Milyo (2001) pool
census data on the 48 continental states from 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 and find that the
relationship between the gini coefficient and mortality is not robust to the inclusion of various
plausibly important controls, such as education, urbanization, and race. There is also a lack of
consistently positive evidence on the role of income inequality from follow-up data on
individuals, in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, where there is a relationship neither in
the individual data nor in the state-level data (Deaton 2001a), from the National Health and
Nutritional Examination Survey (Fiscella and Franks 1997), from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (Daly et al 1998), and only relatively weak evidence from the National Health
Interview Survey (Lochner et al 2001). Furthermore, a study of cities and provinces in Canada
failed to find any relationship between income inequality and mortality, Ross et al (2000).
In the results presented below, we show that, once we control for the fraction of the
population that is black, there is no relationship between income inequality and mortality across
either states or cities. This result does not come from the pooling of black and white mortality; as
emphasized in the earlier literature, the correlation between income inequality and mortality is
present for each race separately. Instead, our results come from the fact that white mortality rates
are higher in places where a higher fraction of the population is black. We do not have an
explanation for this result, although we explore and rule out a number of possibilities. In
particular, the relationship between the fraction black and white mortality rates holds within
broad geographical regions, and so is not driven by a comparison of the South with the rest of the
country. The correlation is also robust to the inclusion of controls for state fixed effects and for
education, holds for nearly all age groups and for males and females, and cannot readily be
2

attributed to variations in local health provision.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses data sources and methodology. Section
3 presents the main results from the states and MSAs. Section 4 explores robustness and
investigates some alternatives. We focus on mortality among whites though, in line with earlier
literature, we also show some results for all races pooled. The results for other races are of
considerable interest in their own right, but we confine our attention here to one element of the
story, leaving for future work the comparative results. That the fraction black increases mortality
rates for blacks is shown in Miller and Paxson (2001). Section 5 concludes.

2. Data and methodology
The data on mortality are taken from the Compressed Mortality Files, (CMF) from the National
Center for Health Statistics at the Center for Disease Control. The CMF contain a complete
census of all deaths by year from 1968 to 1994, by cause of death, race, sex, age group, and
county of residence, except for Alaska where only state-level data are available. The CMF files
also provide population totals for each cell, which we use to calculate mortality rates as well as
racial composition. We use data on deaths in 1980 and 1990. The county identifiers are used to
aggregate deaths and populations to the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level; once again,
Alaska is an exception and is excluded from our MSA analysis. We match 287 MSAs in 1980
and 1990. Not everyone lives in an MSA; the 287 MSAs used here contain 79.9 and 80.7 percent
of the total population of the U.S. in 1980 and 1990 respectively. The data aggregated by state
cover the entire population of the U.S. The CMF data are disaggregated by 13 age groups; we
preserve these age groups when aggregating to the state and MSA levels, and then calculate age3

adjusted all-cause mortality rates by direct adjustment to the U.S. population in 1990. Age
adjustment is done separately by sex, and separately for all races combined and for whites alone.
Hence, for example, the age-specific mortality rates for white females in New York City are
weighted by the age-distribution of white females in the U.S. population in 1990.
The creation of a consistent set of MSA mortality data requires a mapping of counties into
MSAs, as well as a method of handling changes in the definitions of MSAs between the two
years. MSAs are defined by the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and in some
cases, their geographical boundaries changed from 1980 to 1990. MSAs are always collections of
counties, except in New England where they are collections of cities and towns, so that counties
may be split between multiple MSAs. Because the mortality data come at the county level,
aggregating mortality to the MSA level is relatively straightforward outside of New England.
Within New England we use New England County Metropolitan Areas, OMB’s county-based
alternatives to the city- and town-based MSAs.
Data for income and education are taken from the 5 per cent public-use samples of the 1980
(A sample) and 1990 censuses. Income data in the census refer to the previous year, i.e. 1979 or
1989, which is one year earlier than the mortality data from the CMF. Other choices of timing
could be investigated, for example by averaging mortality over several years around the censuses,
or by using mortality several years after each census, but given the arbitrariness of any choice, the
one year lag seems as reasonable as any.
Census data do not come at the county level, but at the level of County Group in 1980 and
PUMA (“Public Use Microdata Area”) in 1990. The 1990 PUMAs do not necessarily match the
1980 County Groups, nor are they necessarily collections of counties. Instead, they can be parts
4

of counties, single counties, collections of whole counties, or collections of parts of counties. Our
procedure is to use the 1990 MSA definitions and create, as closely as possible, consistently
defined metropolitan areas in 1980. We begin with the mapping of County Groups and PUMAs
into MSA definitions given in Jaeger et al (1998) for cities with populations over 250,000
people. In 1990, 20 of the cities with populations over one million people are designated by
OMB as CMSAs, essentially combinations of MSAs, and are treated as units by Jaeger et al. We
split these CMSAs into their component cities, technically referred to as Primary Metropolitan
Statistical Areas (PMSAs). For example, the Dallas-Fort Worth CMSA is composed of the
Dallas PMSA and the Fort Worth-Arlington PMSA, and we treat each as one observation in our
analysis of MSAs. We also include 110 smaller cities; these are defined by OMB, and are
generally places with populations of at least 100,000 but less than 250,000. In the end, we have
287 MSAs consistently defined in 1980 and 1990. 110 of these are the MSAs in Jaeger et al, 54
come from our disaggregation of CMSAs, 110 are smaller cities that were not included by Jaeger
et al, and there are 13 New England County Metropolitan Areas.
In some cases the 1980 County Groups and the 1990 PUMAs contain areas that are partly
inside and partly outside of an MSA. For these, it is not possible to create an exact match
between an area in 1980 and 1990, nor between Census and mortality data. In these cases, a
judgment must be made as to whether to drop the unit, if it is impossible to make a reconciliation
by aggregating up to a reasonably sized larger unit, or to include it, if the differences between the
two years are small. Of our 287 MSAs, 237 contain identical counties in 1980 and in 1990. Of
the 50 others, only a small fraction of the population lives in the areas that are included in only
one year. For each MSA, we calculated the sum of the populations in the two years that lived in
5

counties included in both years, and divided it by the sum of the total populations in the two
years. The resulting ratio is unity for the 237 consistent MSAs. For the other 50, the mean of the
ratio is 93.2 percent, the median is 94.7 percent, and the minimum is 71.9 percent. The
definitions of our MSAs, and their relationship to counties, County Groups, and PUMAs is
detailed in an Addendum to this paper that is available at http://www.wws.princeton.edu/~chw
Each individual in the census is assigned an MSA according to the rules discussed above.
Each is also assigned the adult equivalent household income for the household in which he or she
lives, where equivalent income is calculated by dividing total household income by the number
of adults plus half the number of children, defined as household members aged 18 and younger.
Logarithms of income and of income per equivalent are calculated at the individual level, and
averaged over MSAs and states. Income from the 1980 census—which relates to 1979—is
converted to 1989 prices using the CPI in order to make it comparable with data from the 1990
census. We make no attempt to deal with top-coding. The gini coefficient is calculated on an
individual basis, using income per equivalent adult imputed to each individual. We calculate gini
coefficients and income levels separately by race and by sex, as well as over all races and both
sexes. Note that if all households consisted of a male and female couple, and because the same
per equivalent income is imputed to each, the male and female ginis would be identical.
Although this is not the case, the cross-MSA correlation between the (white) male and female
ginis is 0.97 in 1980 and 0.95 in 1990. For each individual we also record an indicator for the
level of education achieved according to five categories; less than high school, high school, some
college (education post high-school, but without a bachelor’s degree), completed college, postgraduate education (in 1980, more than 16 years of education, in 1990 holding a master’s,
6

professional, or doctoral degree.) The binary indicators are averaged within states and MSAs, for
people aged 25 and above, again separately by sex and race. This gives us data, for example, on
the fractions of adult men or women in Ohio or in Dallas whose highest education is in each of
the five categories.
In the results that follow we use OLS regressions with either state or MSA-level data. The
dependent variable is an age-adjusted mortality rate converted to a log odds. The independent
variables are area averages of the explanatory variables, such as the logarithm of income per
equivalent, or state or MSA-wide estimates of the gini coefficient, racial composition, or the
fractions of the population whose highest level of education is in each of the education classes.
Each regression is weighted by the square root of the population at risk in each state or MSA.

3. Basic results for states and MSAs
Table 1 shows results from the state data, including the District of Columbia, and pooling data
from 1980 and 1990, so that there are 102 observations in each regression. All regressions
include a dummy variable for 1990; if there is a decline in mortality rates that is unexplained by
the included variables, the regression coefficient on the dummy should be negative, as is always
in fact the case. The first two columns in the left-hand panels, for all males and all females
irrespective of race, show the results that are typically reported in the literature. In the first
regression, with no other variables included, the logarithm of per adult equivalent income has a
protective effect that is about twice as large for males as for females, –0.22 versus –0.09. The
1990 dummy has a coefficient of –0.11 for men and –0.07 for women so that there is a
background improvement in mortality that is not explained by changes in income, or at least
7

cannot be explained by assigning the same effect to income over time as it is estimated to have
over states. The second column shows the effects of including income inequality in the form of
the gini coefficient of income per equivalent adult. The gini coefficient attracts large and
significant positive coefficients for both males and females. Over the 51 states in 1990, the mean
of the gini of per equivalent income was 0.37 with a standard deviation of 0.02, so if we move
from one standard deviation below the mean to one above the mean, from Vermont to
Mississippi, or from Michigan to Florida, the log odds increases by 0.057 for men and by 0.043
for women, corresponding to relative risks of (approximately) 1.06 for men and 1.04 for women.
The coefficient on income is not significantly different from zero in these regressions. The
coefficients on the 1990 dummy are larger than before. Mortality declined from 1980 to 1990
while income inequality increased, so that the hazardous effects of inequality that are estimated
from the interstate differences must be offset by the time dummy.
That the estimated effects of income inequality are potentially confounded by the effects of
race has been recognized since the first papers on the topic. Blacks have higher mortality rates
than whites and, on average, have lower incomes, so that in places with a substantial black
population, both income inequality and mortality tend to be higher. That there is some such
problem is shown by the third column in the first panel. When the fraction of the state population
that is black is added to the regressions, it attracts a significantly positive coefficient, and the
coefficient on the gini coefficient is no longer significantly different from zero. But this
regression does little more than illustrate that there is a problem with the first two columns.
Indeed, as noted by Kaplan et al (1996), separate regressions by race find that income inequality
is estimated to be a hazard for each.
8

The results for whites alone are shown in the right-hand panel of Table 1.The coefficient on
the gini coefficient in the second column of the right hand panel is a good deal smaller for whites
than it was for all races taken together, and for women the effect is no longer significantly
different from zero. Once we look only at whites, it is unclear which concept of income
inequality is the appropriate one, inequality among whites in the state, or inequality among
everyone in the state. The third column shows the effect of replacing the gini coefficient for all
incomes with the gini coefficient for white incomes alone. Both coefficients are further reduced,
and neither is significantly different from zero. From this, we can deduce that the component of
income inequality that matters for mortality is income inequality between races, not income
inequality within them. Because blacks are in the minority and have lower incomes, the all-race
gini coefficient will be larger where the fraction black is larger, which suggests including it in the
regressions. The final columns show the regression containing the fraction black together with
the original all-race gini coefficient. The fraction black is estimated to increase white mortality
for both males and females. Taking the same example as before, the difference between Vermont
and Mississippi, with fractions black of zero and 0.34, gives relative risks of 1.14 for white men,
and 1.09 for white women.
The results in Table 1 are important because they show that the effects of income inequality
on mortality at the state level are not robust to the inclusion of the fraction of the population that
is black. They thus demonstrate that the income inequality hypothesis is incorrect, but they tell us
nothing about what actually drives mortality rates. In these state-level data, the fraction black is
higher in the southern states, and it is not difficult to think of reasons why mortality, including
white mortality, might be higher in the South. But alternative hypotheses are difficult to test with
9

data from only 51 states, so it is useful to move on to the larger number of observations offered
by the MSA-level data where it is possible, for example, to look at different regions separately.
Quite apart from the fact that there are more of them, cities are more plausibly salient than states
for the health of their residents.
Our 1990 MSA data appear to be comparable to those used by Lynch, Kaplan, and Pamuk
(1998) (LKP). For example, the correlation coefficients between age-adjusted mortality and the
gini coefficient of per equivalent income is 0.28 (compared with 0.25 with the gini of per capita
income in LKP) and with the logarithm of per equivalent income is –0.32 (compared with is
–0.28 with per capita income in LKP.) Figure 2, which corresponds to Figure 1 for the states,
shows the correlation between the gini and the log odds of age adjusted mortality for all persons.
Each circle represents an MSA, and the diameters of the circles are in proportion to the
population of each, a procedure that makes it clear that the correlation is not driven by a few
large MSAs.
Table 2 reproduces Table 1 using MSA data for 1990. As before, the gini coefficient is a
significant risk factor when the data are pooled across races, and once again, the effect is
removed (indeed reversed) once we control the fraction of each MSA’s population that is black.
When we restrict the regression to whites, the fraction black is a significant health hazard for
both men and women and the coefficients are similar to those estimated from the state data. Once
the fraction black is controlled for, income inequality has no effect, whether we use income
inequality over everyone, as shown in the final column, or income inequality among whites, not
shown. Table 3 repeats the MSA results for 1980. These are shown separately from the 1990
results because, unlike 1990, the gini has no effect on mortality even in the all-race regressions.
10

Even so, the final regressions for white males and females are similar to those for 1990. Whites
die at younger ages in places where a larger fraction of the population is black and, conditional
on fraction black, there is no mortality risk associated with income inequality. Indeed, in both
Tables 2 and 3, and in the latter significantly so, income inequality appears to be protective once
we control for the racial composition of the MSAs.
The key to these results is the relationship between income and race across American states
and cities. Average incomes for the population as a whole, as well as average incomes among
blacks, are negatively correlated with the percent of the population that is black, but the reverse is
true for average white incomes. Average incomes of whites are higher in cities with a larger
fraction of blacks. This divergent behavior of black and white incomes means that the income
difference between blacks and whites is larger in cities with larger black populations, which is
what induces the relationship between overall income inequality and racial composition. Of
course, this does not mean that racial composition and income inequality are the same thing, nor
that either one is an equally valid marker for the same underlying health risk. In regressions
containing both the fraction black and income inequality, the former drives out the latter so that,
even if we cannot tell what it is about a high fraction black that drives the mortality results, it is
not the associated income inequality.

4. Extensions and further exploration
What is it about the racial composition of places that affects their mortality rates? The previous
section demonstrates that it is not the associated income inequality, but nothing beyond that. In
this section, we explore a number of other potentially confounding variables in an attempt to
11

learn something about the mechanism that might be driving these results. As explained in the
introduction, we focus entirely on the effects of racial composition on white mortality.
One hypothesis concerns education. If the presence of a large black minority results in low
levels of education for both blacks and whites, and if education is important for lowering
mortality rates, we might find a spurious correlation between racial composition and education.
We test this hypothesis by using the census data on individuals’ education levels to calculate the
fraction of the white population in each MSA whose highest level of education falls into various
classes. Table 4 shows the results of the mortality regressions with education included using
pooled MSA data from 1980 and 1990.
These results strongly support the view that people with higher education have lower
mortality rates, but they do nothing to moderate the estimated effect of the fraction black on
white mortality rates. The MSA results are consistent with other results using both regional and
individual data; a college education, even some college education, is protective compared with
only a high school education. (Though note that for men, postgraduate education adds nothing,
and for women, those with postgraduate education are no more protected than high-school
graduates or high-school drop outs.) But the main effect of the inclusion of the education
variables is not on the estimated effect of racial composition, but on the estimated effect of
income, which is now estimated to be mildly hazardous. Such findings are consistent with an
earlier literature in economics, Grossman (1975), Fuchs (1989, 1993), and Garber (1989), which
argues that it is education, not income, that is protective of health, as well as Ruhm (2000), who
argues that business-cycle induced increases in income are hazardous to health. However, they
stand in sharp contrast to analyses on individual level data, particularly those using the National
12

Longitudinal Mortality Study, where income is importantly protective of health even conditional
on education, see Elo and Preston (1996) and Deaton and Paxson (2001). The question of
whether it is income, education, or some combination that is important for health matters a great
deal for policy, especially for arguments about the role of fiscal policy in public health. However,
income is not our main concern here, so we do no more than note the puzzle.
Another possible explanation for our main finding is that the provision of public services,
especially health services, is poorer in places with a larger black population. Such an explanation
would require that the provision of such services is in itself an important determinant of (white)
mortality rates, something that goes against an extensive literature that imputes a small or
negligible role to access to health care in explaining differences in mortality by socioeconomic
status, see for example the review by Adler et al (1994). Moreover, there is evidence against the
proposition that health expenditures are indeed lower in places with a larger black minority.
Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly (1999) argue on theoretical grounds that racial diversity is likely to
decrease the political willingness to provide public goods, but in their empirical analysis find that
local public expenditures, including expenditures on health, are higher in places where there is
more ethnic fractionalization—which in the context of the US means in places where there is a
large fraction of the population that is black. In the light of these findings, the provision of local
public goods does not seem a promising avenue for explaining our results.
A third line of enquiry is to look at the results by region. In the state-level results with which
we began, the correlations between mortality, income inequality, and fraction black had much to
do with the South, where all three quantities tend to be higher than in the rest of the country. One
of the main advantages of working with the MSA data is the ability to work within regions, and
13

thus to eliminate the suspicion that the results are being driven by the South versus the rest of the
US. There is also the hypothesis, advanced by Fuchs and McClellan (2001), that the mortality
differences might come from selective migration. Migrants are typically healthier than those who
stay behind so that, if they migrate from areas with larger to smaller minority black populations,
they will increase mortality in the transmitting region and reduce it in the receiving region and,
depending on initial conditions, may induce a correlation between white mortality rates and the
fraction black. A serious examination of this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this paper, but to
the extent that migrations are between regions, intraregional and interregional correlations are
likely to differ.
Table 5 shows the results of running a stripped down regression—log odds of white male and
female mortality on the mean of the logarithm of per equivalent income, the gini, the fraction
black, and the 1990 dummy—for four regions of the US, the North-East, the South, the MidWest, and the West. The effects of income inequality are inconsistent from region to region, and
are more often estimated to be protective than hazardous. There is also some heterogeneity in the
effects of income, with income less protective in the West than elsewhere. But the effects of the
fraction black are consistently and significantly hazardous in all four regions, though the effects
are about twice as large in the North-East and in the South than in the West and Mid-West. In
any event, the effect on white mortality does not reflect some unmeasured difference between the
South and the rest of the US.
Although there are more MSAs than states, there are not enough to allow us to run crossMSA regressions state by state. However, it is possible to run the stripped-down regressions with
the inclusion of dummy variables, one for each state; when MSAs cross state boundaries, we
14

assign them to the state in which the majority of its population lives. Allowing for state effects
allows us to control for unmeasured state-level factors that contribute to mortality rates and that
are potentially correlated with the fraction of the population that is black. However, the fraction
black remains a hazard to health in these regressions. For white males, and using the same
regressions as in Table 5, the coefficient on the fraction black is 0.49 with a t–value of 8.7; for
females, the coefficient is 0.48 with a t–value of 9.9. However, if we go one step further, and
include dummies for each of the 287 MSAs, the coefficient on the fraction black becomes small
and insignificantly different from zero. Unfortunately, this result is not very informative. When
MSA dummies are included, we are essentially running a regression of the changes in the log
odds of mortality against the changes in mean income and the racial composition of the MSAs.
This regression suffers from a lack of precision because the fraction black does not change much
over a decade. Beyond that, all we learn is that the fraction black is standing proxy for some
constant or slowly changing factors that are important in the cross-section, but not in the time
series. We learn nothing about what those factors might be. We also note that the analysis of
changes on changes puts much more strain on the timing—which years of mortality to match
with the 1979 and 1989 income and race data from the census—than is the case with the crosssectional results.
Finally, we look at the age composition of mortality. Because the cause of death differs by
age, locating the effects of racial composition in the age distribution may give some clue about
the mechanisms involved. The age-specific regressions also protect us against potential
artefactual effects associated with age-adjustment, which requires an essentially arbitrary choice
of base population. Table 6 presents the estimated effects of income and of fraction black on the
15

mortality rate in thirteen age groups. The form of these regressions differs from before. In a few
of the smaller MSAs, there are no recorded deaths in the specific age groups in one or other of
the years, and such observations cannot be included in a regression with the log-odds as
dependent variable. Dropping them and running the standard regression produces results that are
qualitatively similar to those in the table. Even so, we present the results of regressions using the
mortality rate itself as the dependent variable. On the right hand side, in addition to the fraction
black and the dummy for 1990, we include the mean of income per equivalent, rather than the
mean of its logarithm. The table shows the coefficients for the fraction black and for income, by
sex and age, with males on the left and females on the right. These are scaled so that the numbers
in the left-hand panel are estimates of the effects on the white mortality rate per 1,000 of moving
from an MSA with zero to one with 100 percent black population, while those in the right-hand
panel are the effects of an additional $1,000 on the mortality rate per 1,000. Average mortality
rates across the MSAs (weighted by population) are shown for comparison.
These results do nothing to resolve the puzzle. The effects of racial composition, like those of
income, are different at different ages, and varying largely in proportion to the level of mortality
itself, so that the effect on the log odds would be roughly the same at all ages. With the exception
of males aged 1 through 9, the fraction black is estimated as a significant risk to mortality at all
ages. It is particularly high for 15–19 year old males, falling off for 15 years thereafter, but rising
rapidly with age thereafter. The effect is always positive, and always significantly different from
zero. Miller and Paxson (2001) further show, using PUMA level data, that the fraction black is
correlated with the death from a range of diseases; for example, for white males aged 25 to 64,
the effect is present for death from infectious disease, cancer, homicide, and cardio-vascular
16

disease, but not for diabetes nor accidents.
Figure 3 shows scatter-plots between the fraction black and the mortality of white males at
selected ages using the MSA data for 1990; once again, the diameters of the circles are
proportional to population size. Note that each plot has its own scale for the vertical axis. The
figures provide an immediate visual counterpart to the results in Table 6, and they also establish
that the correlations do not depend on one or two peculiar MSAs. Even in the three central
panels, where there is one large MSA in the upper-right (New York City), the significance of the
positive correlation is not affected by its exclusion or down-weighting.

5. Conclusions
Cross-section regressions across American states and cities show that, conditional on racial
composition, income inequality does not raise the risk of mortality. The fraction of the
population that is black is a significant risk-factor for mortality, not only for the population as a
whole—which would follow mechanically from the fact that blacks have higher mortality rates
than whites—but for both blacks and whites separately. Our empirical results cast remarkably
little light on why the fraction black should be associated with higher white mortality. The effect
is robust to conditioning on education, it is present for all age-groups except boys aged 1 to 9,
and it is present within geographical regions of the country. It cannot plausibly be attributed to
variation in local public provision of health services. Further research is needed to identify the
mechanisms that generate these effects, as well as to resolve the currently contradictory evidence
on the effects of income and education on mortality rates. These are much more likely to be
productive avenues for research than further work on the effects of income inequality on health.

Notes: Pooled data, 1980 and 1990. Each number comes from an OLS regression with probability of death on the
left hand side and the fraction black, mean income per equivalent in 1989 prices, and a dummy for 1990 on the
right-hand side. The coefficients on fraction black are multiplied by 1,000 and are therefore the effect of a unit
change (from 0 to 1.0) on the mortality rate per 1,000. The coefficient on income is multiplied by 10,000,000, and
so represents the effects of an additional $1,000 of per equivalent income on the mortality rate per 1,000. All
regressions are weighted by the square root of the relevant age and sex specific population.

Note: The first and second columns give the MSA name and FIPS code. The third through fifth columns give the state, and
the codes of the County Groups (1980) and PUMA's (1990) that comprise the MSA. When we include state fixed effects or
run the models separately by region, we assign MSA's that cross state boundaries to the state indicated with an asterisk. The
final column gives the region we assign to each MSA. See main text for additional details.
