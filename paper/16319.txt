The Nature of Excess: Using Randomized Treatments to Investigate Price Dynamics

ABSTRACT
This study explores empirically the price dynamics within two distinct market institutions – a double
oral auction, which resembles modern asset markets, and a bilateral exchange market, which represents
markets that have existed for centuries. To provide a theoretical basis to our investigation, we test
and compare the excess supply model (Walras (1874, 1877, 1889, 1896)) and the excess rent model
(Smith (1962, 1965)) in both market institutions. Our approach is unique in that we make use of appropriate
demand and supply systems coupled with randomization of the main treatment variable to discriminate
between the theories. All previous efforts, including Smith’s (1965) seminal experiments, use designs
that cannot appropriately parse the models. We report several insights, perhaps most importantly, we
consistently reject the Walrasian model in favor of the excess rent model, regardless of market institution.
This finding has important implications both positively and normatively.

1. Introduction
The functioning of markets permeates virtually every field of economics. Yet, even the most basic
market underpinnings remain unresolved. For example, we know surprisingly little about the adjustment
of prices when markets are in disequilibrium.2 The dominant model to describe price fluctuations is the
Walrasian excess supply model. Walras’ (1874, 1877, 1889, 1896) work represents the backbone of
theoretical inquiries within the economic sciences, and more broadly any modeling approach making
use of equilibrium concepts in a market. One important prediction of the excess supply model is that the
larger the excess supply, the more vigorous the sellers’ attempts and thus the faster the decline in
prices. Scores of experimental studies over the past several decades have reported strong support for
Walras’ model using double oral auctions (see Cason and Friedman (1993) for a review).
During his seminal investigation of the Walrasian mechanism, Smith (1962, 1965) presented a
refinement of the excess supply model, which he termed the ‘excess rent’ model.3 Excess rent is defined
as the total rent that would be obtained if all agents who want to trade at the prevailing price were to
trade (i.e., ignoring imbalances in supply and demand) minus the total rent at the competitive
equilibrium. The excess rent model predicts that the greater the excess rent, the faster prices approach
equilibrium. Smith (1962, 1965) reports evidence in favor of his model, rejecting the Walrasian model
using a series of double oral auction markets.
An interesting puzzle therefore arises: how can the Walrasian model find broad support from vast
experimental studies whereas Smith’s seminal work clearly rejects the Walrasian model in favor of the
excess rent model? A second consideration is that the excess supply and excess rent models are both
derived intuitively rather than with rigorous microfoundations. Thus, the behavior and resulting
predictions potentially apply to a range of market institutions, including constructs quite disparate from
the double oral auction.
We tackle these two issues in this study. In dealing with the first issue, our experimental design
leverages two important identification issues overlooked in the extant literature. When at least one out
of demand and supply is strictly monotonic (which is almost always the case in the literature), then
there is a bijective relationship between excess supply and excess rent. Moreover, the broader literature
relies upon naturally occurring variation in prevailing prices to identify the treatment effect. By
sacrificing the use of randomization to generate variation in prevailing prices, previous studies run the
risk of endogeneity bias.
The second consideration is handled by pairing data from two distinct market institutions: double oral
auctions (Smith (1962, 1965)), which are similar to modern asset markets, and bilateral exchange
markets, which are in the spirit of Chamberlin (1948). Such markets have bilateral decentralized
2

In economics, ‘equilibrium’ typically refers to a state where all agents are maximizing expected utility under
rational expectations, possibly subject to a consistency/feasibility constraint, with ‘disequilibrium’ denoting a
failure of at least one of these conditions. In this paper, ‘disequilibrium’ refers to a price that fails to clear a static
supply and demand system rather than any alleged breakdown of rationality or feasibility.

bargaining between multiple traders with public prices. Much like the theoretical literature of the 1980s,
we regard these ‘Chamberlin markets’ as a realistic description of many markets, providing a substantial
source of evidence on models of price dynamics, and an important extension of the markets considered
in Smith (1962, 1965).4
We report several insights. First, a retrospective exploration of Smith (1965) suggests that his reliance
on naturally‐occurring data erroneously drove his rejection of the Walrasian model. Second, the
bijective relationship between excess supply and excess rent inherent in previous experimental designs
suggests one should re‐evaluate much of the extant literature. Studies that have found support for the
Walrasian model have implicitly also found support for the excess rent model. Third, using appropriate
supply and demand systems and randomization of the treatment variable, we find strong support for
the excess rent model versus the Walrasian model in both Chamberlin markets and double oral auction
institutions.
We conclude that as microfoundations develop, great import should be given to disparate predictions
across the excess rent and Walrasian models. Our exercise suggests that as empirical evidence
accumulates, the excess rent model will gain broader support. If this hypothesis proves correct, then this
would be a fundamental change in direction, as the Walrasian excess supply model remains the
cornerstone of much of the literature’s analysis of price dynamics. For example, Walrasian tatonnement
is the foundation for much of the recent literature on dynamic auction design (see, e.g., Gul and
Stacchetti (2000), Ausubel and Cramton (2004), Ausubel (2004), Ausubel (2006).
The remainder of our study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief background of the
literature and our experimental design. Section 3 summarizes our empirical results. Section 4 concludes.

2. Background and experimental design
A. Background
Despite the centrality of the market mechanism to the economics discipline, there is a dearth of models
that yield testable predictions about price dynamics.5 Moreover neither the excess supply nor excess

4

Using strictly monotonic demand and supply systems, several studies have found support for the
indistinguishable (see below) predictions of the excess supply and excess rent models (see the seminal work of
Hong and Plott (1982), as we well as the studies due to Joyce (1983), List (2004) and List and Price (2005)).
5
In an important work, Plott and George (1992) consider an alternative to Walrasian stability called Marshallian
stability, and in empirical testing they find support for the latter. However the Marshallian model only generates
predictions that differ to the Walrasian model when at least one out of supply and demand has a perverse slope.
For a deeper look at some testable predictions about other aspects of double oral auctions, see Cason and
Friedman (1993) and Cason and Friedman (1996). For an investigation of price dynamics in a double auction with
three commodities (rather than the usual case of one commodity) see Anderson et al. (2004). For price dynamics in
decentralized markets, see Moreno and Wooders (2002).

rent models have rigorous microfoundations.6 Building on the theoretical bargaining literature of the
1980s, a large literature on the microfoundations of competitive equilibria emerged to fill this gap. A
major strand investigated whether price‐taking competitive equilibria could emerge as the outcomes of
markets with bilateral negotiation as frictions – such as the discount rate or explicit bargaining costs –
tended to zero (see, e.g., Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1985), Wolinsky (1988, 1990), and Gale (1987)). Yet,
such models focused largely on the properties of equilibria rather than explicit predictions or
explanations of price movements en route to equilibrium.7 Gjerstad and Dickhaut (1998) provide an
important middle‐ground in the sense that it delves deeply into the micro behavior in markets but does
not apply full rationality – traders are myopic and expectations are not fully rational.8
Differentiating the excess supply and excess rent model
We are tempted to use the abundant data from experimental double oral auctions and Chamberlin
markets to compare the two models, but there is an important identification issue limiting this
approach. When at least one out of demand and supply is strictly monotonic (almost always the case),
then there is a bijective relationship between excess supply and excess rent. This presents two options
to the researcher.
First, the researcher can simply accept that there is nothing in the theory alone that permits
discriminating variation in excess supply/rent.9 Consequently, studies that have found support for the
excess supply model have implicitly also found support for the excess rent model.
Second, the researcher can make functional form assumptions such as linearity, e.g., Alton and Plott
(2008). The problem with this approach is that the assumption is arbitrary; while econometricians
regularly assume linearity, it is extremely rare that linearity is a necessary condition for identification.
Moreover using their data, they find little evidence of the econometric superiority of one model over
the other, casting doubt about the usefulness of such arbitrary assumptions.
Smith (1965) sidesteps this problem by noting that in a constant excess demand and supply system
(Figure 2) excess supply is constant but excess rent still varies over a range of prices. This allowed Smith
6

Interestingly, Walras never came up with the idea of a central auctioneer, nor did he even mention any institution
that could even vaguely be contorted into a centralized market mechanism (Walker (1996)). Walras’ description of
the equilibration process clearly corresponded most closely to what we refer to as a Chamberlin market, i.e.,
bilateral decentralized bargaining between multiple traders with public prices (Chamberlin (1948)).
7
This was probably at least in part due to the analytical complexity of the models. Another strand of the literature
looked at the properties of bilateral bargaining but without taking the limit as frictions go to zero. See for example
Cramton (1984), Perry (1986), Chatterjee and Samuelson (1987), Samuelson (1992) and Taylor (1995). Rustichini et
al. (1994) and Cason and Friedman (1997) examine similar issues in single call markets rather than bilateral
negotiations.
8
Cason and Friedman (1993) also present insightful models with testable predictions. However they are either
based on comparatively stylized forms of bounded rationality or the sharper predictions (such as the order in
which traders trade) do not pertain to the path of prices.
9
Technically, excess supply and excess rent are not variation free (see Heckman (2000)). If either model made
specific functional form predictions, then one might still be able to compare them. However both only provide
qualitative predictions.

to compare predictions from the competing models using data from experimental double oral auctions.
Smith reports broad support for the excess rent model using this institution. While this design is quite
elegant, rather than randomizing the prevailing market price, Smith (1965) relied upon naturally
occurring variation in prices to differentiate the models. Empirically, such an approach may prove
problematic as the key treatment variable of interest (prevailing prices) is endogenously determined.
With this concern in mind, we provide a retrospective look at Smith’s (1965) data. Our analysis suggests
that Smith’s reliance on naturally‐occurring data erroneously drove rejection of the Walrasian model. As
Smith himself noted, one cannot get too close to the equilibrium price
as the excess supply model
suffers from a floor effect. This is so because it predicts a constant discrete rate of change of prices

4.5% of the trading tunnel’s height from the equilibrium price, and he showed that his results were
unaffected by dropping data points in the relevant range. Unfortunately, his results are not robust to
assuming a larger value of .
To see this, we reconstruct Smith’s original data.10 Table 1 is a reproduction of Table 2 from Smith
(1965). In (our) Table 3, we extend the models that Smith estimated.11 In models 1 and 2, we increase
the proportion of prices that Smith dropped from 4.5% to 25%. In one of the two, excess rent loses its
statistical significance, and importantly the excess supply model seemingly outperforms the excess rent
model.
The picture becomes even more blurred when we note another drawback to Smith’s (1965) design.
Smith (1965) pooled data from three different constant excess systems: one with a constant excess
supply of 2 units, one with 5 units and one with 8 units. This assumption of a homogenous treatment
effect is not theoretically motivated. Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that the causal effect is
heterogenous across these systems. For example, a prevailing price that is $12 over equilibrium in a
market with an excess supply of 2 units would intuitively generate different price dynamics to a
prevailing price that is $3 over equilibrium in a market with an excess supply of 8 units, even though
both imply identical excess rent.
With this in mind, models 3‐to‐5 in Table 3 replicate model 5 from Table 1 but conditions on one of the
three possible constant excess supplies (2 units, 5 units and 8 units). Models 6‐to‐8 from Table 3
10

We reconstructed Smith’s data from figures in his paper. In principle, all of his data are shown, though the grid
has imperfections and therefore the dataset that we have constructed cannot be ensured to be exactly as the
original. Nevertheless, using Smith’s regression tables as a benchmark, we are able to achieve a high degree of
accuracy in our recovered data. Table 1 is a recreation of Table 2 from Smith (1965), and Table 2 is our attempt at
reproduction. Visual inspection confirms that our reconstruction is extremely accurate.

replicate 3‐to‐5 from Table 3 but with 25% of the tunnel dropped. Importantly, when we implement
these additional controls, only one of the six regressions yields a significant effect of excess rent – calling
into question Smith’s interpretation of the data.
The homogeneous treatment effect assumption is actually much stronger than just described. A demand
and supply system is defined by the values/costs of its participants. Every time a pair of traders strikes a
deal and exits the market, the system has changed as there are now two fewer traders. The change is
unlikely to be appreciable in real markets with hundreds or thousands of traders, but in a market with
below 30 traders, the two traders exiting represent anywhere from 7%‐33% of the market.12 Moreover
in non‐constant excess systems, where sellers and buyers are not homogenous, the shapes of the supply
and demand schedules can change substantially after a pair trade and exit. Smith (1965) and the
subsequent literature assume a treatment effect that does not vary with respect to the system by
pooling data. Smith did not collect enough data for us to explore if this assumption affects his results,
but as discussed below we design our markets to avoid the need for making such assumptions.
In conclusion, our retrospective analysis calls into question Smith’s (1965) received results, and casts
doubt on whether the excess rent model is appropriate. In light of the literature, one might even argue
that with this re‐analysis, the weight of evidence is now in favor of the Walrasian model. We view this
conclusion as premature at this point since the broader literature has difficulty parsing the models, as
discussed above.
To facilitate further reassessment, we introduce an important modification to Smith’s (1965) design. We
manipulate
to ensure that it is well away from the equilibrium. We achieve such manipulation by
announcing to traders – immediately prior to the start of trading – that “in a similar market to the one
you are about to participate in, a trade occurred at price X,” where X is randomly selected.13 Naturally,
experimenter manipulation and randomization go hand in hand. As we will demonstrate in the results
section, our strategy leads to a resurrection of Smith’s potentially erroneous siding with the excess rent
model.

Smith’s constant excess experiments had 11 buyers and either 13, 16 or 19 sellers. See Alton and Plott (2007,
2008) for pioneering ways of modeling a continuous in‐ and out‐flow of traders.
13
It should be noted that Plott and George (1992) also announce prices prior to the start of trading. However, they
do so in a different way and for a different reason. They construct demand and supply systems with multiple
equilibrium types to see which are most stable. Natural variation in prices seldom led subjects starting in one of
the equilibrium types, precluding a test of its stability. Hence, the authors used announcements to induce the
subjects into the desired equilibrium. Thus their motivation had nothing to do with addressing potential
endogeneity. Moreover, they never used variation in an induced price as a (randomized) treatment variable.

prevailing price
on the rate of change of prices Δ ?
Aside from the floor effect, Walras’ excess supply model predicts a causal effect of zero, while Smith’s
excess rent model predicts a negative causal effect. Yet, we should note that this method of inquiry has
an important caveat. Suppose that the data generating process is:

Research question 2: Does the answer to research question 1 depend upon whether the prevailing price
is randomly induced versus naturally occurring?
Experimenter control over treatment variables and the concomitant randomization is desirable even if a
plausible endogeneity story about natural data fails to spring to mind. However, as discussed above
there are explicit grounds for doubting Smith’s (1965) results.
A further purpose of the study is comparing the excess rent and excess supply models across different
trading institutions. We chose the Chamberlin market and double oral auction principally to extend the
domain of testing the models. With respect to the models’ testable predictions, we are interested in
examining if our conclusions are consonant across both institutions. However, it is interesting to explore
for additional differences between Chamberlin markets and double oral auctions as a potential avenue
to explore microfoundations. This leads to our third and final research question:
Research question 3: Are there fundamental differences in the distribution of prices or in price
dynamics between Chamberlin and double oral auctions markets?

7

C. Procedure
1. Market structure
To discriminate between the excess supply and excess rent models, we use a constant excess demand
and supply system with two buyers with value and four sellers with cost , implying a constant excess
supply of 2 units. No information about any aspect of the market is given to the subjects beyond generic
instructions on how to trade (see the Appendix for the experimental instructions). To ensure that the
results are not driven by unfamiliarity with the protocol, we have subjects participate in four distinct
markets.14 This carries the risk of subjects augmenting their learning about the protocol with learning
about the values/costs of the market. To account for this possibility, we employ several strategies.
First, values and costs are displaced by a common additive constant between rounds. Thus, for example
if in round 1,
$20 and
$10, then in round 2 they might be
$75 and
$65. This process
and the values of the constants are not declared to the subjects. Moreover, the chosen constants ensure
no overlap of the bargaining tunnels between any two rounds.
Second, we vary the surplus in each system. For two of the rounds, the available surplus per trade is $8
(low surplus), while for the other two it is $16 (high surplus). Unbeknownst to subjects, markets
alternate. Having two substantively different systems also serves as a simple robustness check.
Third, in addition to the six ‘active’ traders, there are four ‘inactive’ traders in each round. Two are
buyers with values that are below and two are sellers with costs that are above (see Figure 3).
Unbeknownst to subjects, the inactive traders can never trade in the round ‐ only trades that imply
weakly positive earnings for both traders are permitted.
Finally, which trader is active or inactive in a particular round changes over the four rounds. It is
common knowledge that buyers (sellers) remain buyers (sellers) for all four rounds, but each buyer is
active for two, while each seller is active for between two and four.
To summarize, each session has 10 subjects who are randomized an ID (from ID1 to ID10) at the
beginning of the session. They then participate in four real rounds of trading with the values/costs in
Table 4. Each round has exactly two trades.
To maximize clarity, values/costs are denominated in US$ and gross earnings for each subject are simply
the aggregate of that subject’s earnings across all four rounds. Each trader also receives a trading
commission of $0.25 per trade.

14

Prior to the four real rounds, subjects also do two practice rounds – one as a seller and one as a buyer – to
further promote familiarity with the trading procedure.

8

2. Trading rules
The 10 subjects are seated facing the monitor. We run principally Chamberlin markets, but to facilitate
comparability with Smith (1965) we also run double oral auctions.15 Chamberlin markets operate
according to the following rules. Each trading round lasts 3 minutes. During a trading round,
negotiations can take almost any form.16 Subjects are instructed to approach the monitor after agreeing
upon a contract. The monitor ensures that the trade is legitimate (both subjects are earning weakly
positive amounts), after which the monitor publicly declares the trade price.17
3. Price inducement and treatments
In each round, after value/cost cards are handed to each subject, the monitor makes the following
statement:
“In a similar market to the one you are about to participate in, a trade occurred at price
$ . You may now begin trading.”
where the prevailing price is randomized.18 We view the randomization of prices to be an important
design innovation as it affords the research a means to avoid the types of problems discussed in Section
2.A. Of course, there are alternative inducement mechanisms. One is to wait for a certain amount of
time after the start of trading and then make a comparable statement. In principle, this decreases the
risk of a priming effect of our statement. Another alternative is to introduce confederates and to have
them trade at a pre‐arranged, randomized price after a certain amount of time.
We reject both these alternatives for the same reasons. First, piloting indicated that the first trade
would often happen very quickly (within 20 second or less of the beginning of trading). Second,
negotiations were often so vigorous that subjects would not be paying much attention to such a
statement by the monitor. In double oral auctions, at most one person is talking at any point and so
prices of completed trades are very salient. In the trading‐pit environment of a Chamberlin market with
excess supply, our chosen method of inducing prices was likely the highest‐power method of testing the
excess rent model.
Moreover, it should be noted that independent of and simultaneous to our study, Crockett et al. (2009)
implemented a different method for generating exogenous variation in the prevailing price to test the
Gale model: explicit price controls, i.e., preventing participants from trading below or above certain

the Chamberlin market.
16
No inappropriate threats, no side payments and no revelation or discussion of values/costs.
17
The substantive differences in the double oral auctions is that the only communication permitted is bids and
offers when called upon by a monitor (the subject must raise his/her hand).
18
To avoid deception, the induced price was a naturally occurring price obtained from a previous pilot that did not
involve any price inducement.

prices.19 For their study, this method served its purpose well, as they aimed for exogenous trades within
a certain range. However, for the purposes of comparing the excess supply and excess rent models, our
method adds an important dimension.
Making a price announcement about a trade occurring in a similar market is a good simulation of the
information content usually carried by naturally occurring prevailing prices. Traders can look at their
values/costs and make an inference about their standing compared to the market, since the prevailing
price gives them a lower (upper) bound on the value (cost) of at least one trader. This process is
essential to the described mechanics of the excess rent model and therefore it is an important inclusion
for its testing. In fact, the alleged superiority of markets to central planning rests on the ability of the
prevailing price to transmit relevant information about the state of the market. In contrast, if one were
to use purely price controls that were unrelated to any previous market activity, traders learn nothing
immediately and must wait to start trading before they can learn something about their standing
compared to the remaining traders.
Under the assumption that shifting the values/costs by a common additive constant does not affect
market dynamics (an assumption that we test below and fail to reject), our sessions examine two
markets only: $8‐per‐trade surplus and $16‐per‐trade surplus. Another design innovation is that our
inference will be based on different prevailing prices
in the same demand and supply system. As
discussed above, there is nothing in the formulation of either the excess supply or excess rent model
that requires structural causal effects to be identical across demand and supply systems. The models
make predictions only about causal effects within a system defined in the narrowest possible sense.
All of our identification is based on prevailing prices that vary across identical demand and supply
systems. Thus, we compare behavior from the same round between sessions. This raises the question of
which induced prices maximize power. The excess rent model predicts a monotonic relationship
between excess rent and price movements. Moreover, while there may be heteroskedasticity in price
movements, we had no a priori reason to expect any particular form of heteroskedasticity. Thus, the
highest power test would be to share the observations equally between the highest and lowest possible
trade prices only.
However, as Smith (1965) noted and as discussed above, one cannot get too close to the equilibrium
price as the excess supply model suffers from a floor effect. Smith assumed that this floor occurred at
4.5% of the constant per‐trade surplus above . We provide extra clearance by selecting a low induced
price that is 25% of the constant per‐trade surplus above . On the high side we selected an induced
price that is 75% of the constant per‐trade surplus above . We wanted to avoid the highest possible
price because we wanted to be able to check for a priming effect, and this would require trade prices to
be both above and below the induced price.

19

Plott (2000) had previously used price controls, but never to address potential endogeneity bias; rather he was
doing it to expand the support of the treatment variable, e.g., to see what happens when prices are near a certain
equilibrium. In other words, his is a variant on the method used in Plott and George (1992).

10

Table 5 details the high and low induced prices used in each round. We ran two session types: in session
type 1, the induced price sequence across the four rounds was low‐low‐high‐high, while in session type
2 it was high‐high‐low‐low.

3. Empirical results
We ran 20 Chamberlin market sessions and 14 double oral auction sessions in two locations (George
Mason University and University of Tennessee at Knoxville).20 Subjects were recruited using campus
databases of subjects who had declared an interest in economics experiments. Including check‐in and
payment processing, sessions lasted approximately 45 minutes and subjects earned an average of
roughly $20.
To add structure, we should note that each session had four markets where the active buyers had a
common value and the active sellers an active cost . And, each market had an induced price ,

Table 6 and the accompanying Figure 4 contain a summary of the experimental data. In this summary, to
provide a first glimpse of data patterns we have ignored statistical dependencies and pooled over
systems where values and costs have been displaced by a common additive constant. As we discuss
each result below, we supplement these raw data patterns with a conditional empirical analysis that
accounts for data dependencies. We provide a first result:
Result 1a: In a constant excess demand and supply system, the causal effect of the prevailing price
on the rate of change of prices Δ
is negative in both Chamberlin and double oral auction markets.
This finding strongly supports the excess rent model over Walras’ excess supply model. Evidence to
support this result can be seen in Table 6 and Figure 4, where the difference between the induced price
and trade price 1 is larger under the high induced price than under the low one. If we normalize the
estimated treatment effects so that they correspond to a $1 increase in the induced price, the estimated
treatment effects are:

Kolmogorov‐Smirnov tests confirm that we can pool data across the two locations.

All of these differences are statistically significant at the p < 1% level using Mann‐Whitney tests.
These unconditional tests treat observations as IID. As a robustness check, we estimate conditional
parametric regression models that include round dummies and session clusters. Empirical results are
contained in Table 7. Importantly, they mirror the unconditional results described above.
We have used the absolute rate of change of prices as the outcome variable. Technically, neither the
excess supply nor the excess rent models specify using the absolute rate of change of prices, and so one
could plausibly use the proportionate rate of change Δ ⁄ instead. Doing so does not affect result
1a, so we make these results available upon request.
We have used a mixture of between and within subject variation to estimate causal effects (clustered
standard errors are not elixirs). An even more conservative approach is to use the data from the first
round of each session only, i.e., exclusively between variation. Since we did not use a full‐factorial
design, we can only complete this exercise using data from the low surplus Chamberlin and double oral
auction markets. Result 1a is again unaffected.
As a final robustness check, recall that we induce the prevailing price by making a statement about an
actual trade price in a similar market in a previous session. Since this information is delivered by the
monitor, there is a risk of an experimenter demand effect. The subjects could consciously or
unconsciously be primed to seek a trade at the announced prevailing price.
To see if result 1a is sensitive to this possibility, we repeat the hypothesis tests omitting either (1) all
observations where the first trade price is equal to the induced price, or (2) all observations where the
first trade price is within $1 of the induced price. Result 1a remains unaffected.
In all four market‐types (high vs. low surplus and Chamberlin vs. double oral auction), using Wald tests,
. Thus, to ensure that result 1a is not spurious,
we strongly reject (p < 1%) the hypothesis that
we need to demonstrate that has a treatment effect on . This leads to our next result:
Result 1b: Result 1a is not a spurious reflection of white noise. Trade price 1
induced price
.

responds to the

is always larger under the
Evidence to support this result can be seen in Table 6 and Figure 4, where
high induced price than under the low induced price. In three of the four cases (all but high surplus
Chamberlin), Mann‐Whitney tests reject the hypothesis that has a zero causal effect on (p < 1%, p
< 4%, p < 10%; p = 28% in the remaining case). Using the conditional estimates in Table 7, we find similar
results if one tests the hypothesis that the coefficient on is equal to 1.
This also speaks to the effectiveness of our price inducement procedure in simulating a genuine
prevailing price. The trade price from a previous session carries substantial information that affects
subsequent trade prices. We now turn to our next result:
Result 2: Result 1a is unaffected by using naturally occurring data.

12

This result shows that in our data, endogeneity bias alone is not driving the insights gained from the
naturally‐occurring data. Evidence to support this result can be seen in Table 8. Note that in the
naturally occurring data, the treatment variable is the first trade price, . Unlike the induced price ,
this takes many values and hence we are forced to use a parametric model to estimate the causal effect.
In all four markets, the causal effect of the prevailing price on the rate of change of prices is negative. It
is tempting to compare the magnitudes of the coefficients from the naturally occurring data to those
from the exogenous data. However, these are different markets: there are two less traders, so the
demand and supply system has changed.
Similar to result 1a, result 2 is also robust to using proportional rates‐of‐change in prices, as well as using
exclusively between‐session variation (round 1 data only).
As the tables and figures make clear, our conclusions are robust to changes in market institution,
however, it is informative to test for differences between Chamberlin and double oral auction markets.
Upon doing so, a final result emerges:
Result 3: The relationship between the induced price and the first trade price is the same across trading
institutions. The relationship between the first and second trade prices differs by trading institution.
Specifically, in double oral auctions, the second trade price exhibits greater dependence on the first
trade price.
Examining Table 6, if we compare data cells by trading institution using Kolmogorov‐Smirnov and Mann‐
Whitney tests, then we fail to reject equality with only one exception: trade price 2 is significantly larger
in the high surplus Chamberlin market ($3.5) than in the high surplus double oral auction ($2.0).
However, even if each cell in Table 6 was identically distributed across trading institution, it would still
be possible for the relationships between induced price
and trade price 1
, or trade price 1
and trade price 2
, to differ substantially.
In Table 7, the differences in the point estimates across trading institution are quite small ($0.24/trade
for low surplus and $0.12/trade for high surplus). Pooling the data across institution and including full
interaction terms confirms that these differences are statistically insignificant at conventional levels. For
parsimony, we make the results available upon request.
In Table 8, the differences in the point estimates across trading institution are large and positive
($0.52/trade for low surplus and $0.70/trade for high surplus). Pooling the data across institution and
including full interaction terms confirms that these differences are statistically significant at
conventional levels. As such, trade prices are more persistent in double oral auctions, yet it is important
to highlight that these behavioral differences do not affect our conclusions concerning the excess supply
model versus the excess rent model.

4. Conclusion
Understanding price dynamics within and across market institutions merits serious consideration. If
prices do not follow the Walrasian excess supply model, the cornerstone of theoretical inquiries within
the economic sciences is directly called into question. While Smith (1965) provides strong support
refuting the Walrasian excess supply model using double oral auction markets, there are methodological
concerns underlying his fundamental design. Adding to this concern is the fact that scores of
experimental studies report evidence consistent with the Walrasian model. An honest appraisal of the
literature provides one with the realization that the correct price adjustment model remains largely
unknown.
This study attempts to provide clarity to these issues by using randomization in a constant excess
demand and supply system across two distinct market institutions. This approach permits us to
discriminate between the models using experimental variation of the key variable (the prevailing price).
We find strong support for the excess rent model in both Chamberlin markets and double oral auctions.
We find that the bijective relationship between excess supply and excess rent inherent in previous
experimental designs suggests one cannot make strong inference from the extant literature.
At this point, it is important to note that the intuitive derivation of the excess supply and excess rent
models means that they only generate one qualitative prediction. And, it is one that they share for most
demand and supply systems. In principle, however, they can yield a rich array of testable predictions –
predictions that potentially help us gain a more rigorous understanding of price dynamics. We hope that
our research will spur explorations of microfoundations, lending deeper insights into predictions across
the excess rent and Walrasian models. As this is done, our exercise can be viewed as providing support
for the extant predictions of the excess rent model, but richer tests will surely arrive as research
intensifies on this issue. In this manner, perhaps the most important area for future research is to flesh
out the microfoundations of the models to generate additional testable predictions.

Table 2: Attempted reconstruction of Table 1 using data inferred from charts
We reconstructed Smith’s data by studying the figures in his paper. In principle, they show all the
data, though the grid has some imperfections and so the dataset that we have constructed is not
exactly the same as the original. Nevertheless, using Smith’s regression tables as a benchmark,
we are able to achieve a high degree of accuracy in our recovered data. Table 1 is recreation of
Table 2 from Smith (1965), and Table 2 is our attempt at reproducing it. The dependent variable
in all regressions is Δ . Asterices denote statistical significance (* = 10%, ** = 5%, *** = 1%).
Visual inspection confirms that our reconstruction is extremely accurate.

Experimental instructions
Today, we are going to set up a market in which some of you will be buyers and some of you will be
sellers. The commodity to be traded is divided into distinct items, or “units”. We will not specify a name
for the commodity; we will simply refer to units.
Trading will occur in a sequence of trading rounds. The prices that you negotiate in each round will
determine your earnings. You will be paid all earnings for the session at the end of the session in cash.
The experiment will consist of 6 rounds. The first 2 rounds will be practice and will not affect your
earnings for the experiment.
Every round, you will get a card. The card will indicate whether you are a buyer or a seller for that
round. During the practice rounds, you will be both a buyer and a seller. Once we have completed the
practice rounds, you will be assigned the role of either a buyer or a seller and will remain in that role
throughout the remainder of the session.
Prior to the start of each round, sellers will be provided a seller’s card. The number on the sellers’ card is
known as their “cost”. Your cost represents the minimum amount for which you can sell a unit. This
information contained on the seller’s card is strictly private. A seller’s costs may change each round.
Sellers earn money by selling units at prices that are above their cost. Earnings from the sale of each unit
are the difference between the sale price and the cost. For example, if a seller has a cost of $10 and sells
their unit for $15, they earn $15 – $10 = $5.
If a seller does not sell their unit, they earn exactly zero that round. You will only be allowed to sell at a
price equal to or greater than your cost. If you attempt to sell a unit at a price that is less than your cost,
your trade will be cancelled.
Prior to the start of each round, buyers will be provided a buyer’s card. The number on the buyers’ card
is known as their “value”. Your value is represents the maximum amount for which you can purchase a
unit. The information contained on the buyer’s card is strictly private and a buyer’s value may change
each round.
Buyers earn money by buying units at prices that are below their value. Earnings from the purchase of
each unit are the difference between the value and the purchase price. For example, if a buyer has a
value of $20 and buys a unit for $12, they earn $20 – $12 = $8.
If a buyer does not buy a unit, they earn exactly zero that round. You will only be allowed to buy at a
price equal to or below your value. If you violate attempt to purchase a unit at a price that is greater
than your value, your trade will be cancelled.
In addition to earnings from buying (selling) at a price that is less than your value (greater than your
cost), we will provide a commission of 25¢ to both the buyer and seller for each unit traded.

24

[Chamberlin markets]
Each trading round will be up to 3 minutes long. During the round, you can approach anyone to
negotiate a potential sale/purchase. There are three rules that you must follow during the experiment.
1. You are not allowed to threaten or intimidate other traders.
2. You are not allowed to discuss or disclose your cost or value with any other trader.
3. You are not allowed to discuss post‐session side payments with any other trader.
If you violate any of these rules, you will be asked to leave the experiment and will earn nothing for
participating.
If you make a trade, you and your partner should approach me immediately and inform me of the trade
price to confirm that it is a legitimate trade. Remember that you cannot trade in a way that gives you
negative earnings. That means sellers can only trade at a price above their cost and buyers can only
trade at a price below their value.
After any pair trade and I have a record of their trade price, I will call out their trade price so that all the
remaining participants can hear it.
I will now hand out practice trading cards. Remember: you are not allowed to discuss the information on
the cards with any other trader. Please take care not to reveal it accidentally to curious traders looking
over your shoulder.

Each trading round will be up to 3 minutes long. Once the market is open, any buyer is free to raise their
hand and, when called upon, make a verbal bid to buy at a price that is less than or equal to their value.
Likewise, any seller is free at any time to raise their hand and, when called upon, to make a verbal offer
to sell at a price that is equal to or above their cost. I will record bids and offers on this board. Any seller
is free to accept the bid of any buyer, and any buyer is free to accept the offer of any seller. As soon as a
bid or offer is accepted, a binding contract has been closed and the buyer and seller making the deal are
to drop out of the market, making no more bids, offers, or contracts for the remainder of that trading
period.
Note that buyers cannot withdraw bids and sellers cannot withdraw offers. However after a trade has
been completed, I will erase all standing bids and offers from the board.
Except for the bids and offers you are not to speak to any other subject until the experiment is
complete. If you violate this rule, you will be asked to leave the experiment and will earn nothing for
participating.
If you make a trade, I will confirm that it is a legitimate trade. Remember that you cannot trade in a way
that gives you negative earnings. That means sellers can only trade at a price above their cost and
buyers can only trade at a price below their value.

We will now do 2 practice rounds. For the practice rounds, earnings will be denominated in $. Earnings
from these rounds do not count towards your total earnings for today’s session. Rather the practice
rounds are designed to provide you familiarity with the trading protocol.
Once we have completed the practice rounds, you will be assigned the role of buyer or seller. Once we
have assigned your role, we will distribute the buyer and seller cards for round #1 and begin the portion
of the experiment that will influence your earnings for today’s session. We will begin the first practice
round. You have 3 minutes to trade. Go!
We will now do 4 real rounds. Earnings are denominated in $. Your total earnings for the session will be
the sum of your earnings from all 4 rounds. In a similar market to the one you are about to participate
in, a trade occurred at price $X. You may now begin trading.
