Exchange Rate Pass-Through into Import Prices: A Macro or Micro Phenomenon?
José Manuel Campa and Linda S. Goldberg
NBER Working Paper No. 8934
May 2002
JEL No. F3, F4

ABSTRACT
Exchange rate regime optimality, as well as monetary policy effectiveness, depends on the
tightness of the link between exchange rate movements and import prices. Recent debates hinge on
whether producer-currency-pricing (PCP) or local currency pricing (LCP) of imports is more prevalent,
and on whether exchange rate pass-through rates are endogenous to a country's macroeconomic
conditions. We provide cross-country and time series evidence on both of these issues for the imports of
twenty-five OECD countries. Across the OECD and especially within manufacturing industries, there is
compelling evidence of partial pass-through in the short-run- rejecting both PCP and LCP. Over the long
run, PCP is more prevalent for many types of imported goods. Higher inflation and exchange rate
volatility are weakly associated with higher pass-through of exchange rates into import prices. However,
for OECD countries, the most important determinants of changes in pass-through over time are
microeconomic and relate to the industry composition of a country's import bundle.

Introduction
While exchange rate pass-through has long been of interest, the focus of this interest

has evolved considerably over time. After a long period of debate over the law of one price
and convergence across countries, beginning in the late 1980s exchange rate pass-through
studies emphasized industrial organization and the role of segmentation and price
discrimination across geographically distinct product markets. More recently pass-through
issues play a central role in heated debates over appropriate monetary policies and exchange
rate regime optimality.1 These debates hinge on the issue of the prevalence of producercurrency-pricing (PCP) versus local currency pricing (LCP) of imports, and on whether
exchange rate pass-through rates are endogenous to a country’s inflation performance. Low
import price pass-through means that nominal exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower
expenditure switching effects of domestic monetary policy, thereby leaving monetary policy
more effective for dealing with real shocks. If pass-through rates are endogenous to a
country’s relative monetary stability, the extent of this monetary policy effectiveness may be
fragile and regime-specific.2
The first goal of our paper is to provide extensive cross-country and time-series
evidence on exchange rate pass-through into the import prices of 25 OECD countries. Using
quarterly data from 1975 through 1999, we document the prevalence of PCP and LCP in
short-run and long-run pass-through elasticities. We use an economically meaningful
estimation approach, meaning that we estimate pass-through rates after controlling for
exporter marginal cost shifters.
At the level of an aggregated import bundle, the evidence across countries is strongly
supportive of partial exchange rate pass-through in the short run (defined as one quarter). The
unweighted average of pass-through elasticities across the OECD countries is about 60
percent over one quarter, and about 75 percent over the longer term. The United States has
among the lowest pass-through rates in the OECD, at about 25 percent in the short run and 40
percent over the longer run. Corresponding rates of pass-through into German import prices
are approximately 60 percent in the short run and 80 percent in the long run. We find that

The implications of pass-through performance for optimal monetary policy also is explored in Corsetti and
Pesenti (2001), Obstfeld (2000), Devereux (2000), and Devereux and Engel (2000), among others.
2
See Taylor (2001). The role of the invoicing decisions of producers in influencing pass-through rates is
explored in recent work by Devereux and Engel (2001) and Bacchetta and vanWincoop (2001).

2

rankings of elasticities are not tightly correlated with country size, especially when the
composition of country import bundles differs substantially.
At a more disaggregated industry level, we reach similar conclusions about the
prevalence of partial pass-through into import prices. There is strong evidence against both
PCP and LCP as short-run descriptions of pass-through into Manufacturing and Food import
prices. With manufacturing trade now so pervasive for OECD countries, these results drive
the partial pass-through observed in almost all countries. Non-manufacturing and Raw
Material imports generally reject LCP, and are mixed on rejections of PCP. Such findings
are consistent with intuition about pass-through rates into products that are often invoiced in
dollars.
The second goal of our paper is to provide insights into the forces underlying crosscountry differences in pass-through rates and changes in pass-through elasticities over time
but within countries. An intriguing hypothesis posed by John Taylor (2001) is that passthrough of costs into markups is endogenous to a country’s inflation performance. The
important implication is that there is a virtuous -- but fragile -- circle wherein low inflation
(variability) leads to reduced markups, less inflationary implications of monetary expansions,
and continued low markups. Taylor argues that if declines in pass-through are a product of
the low inflation environment of recent years (which in turn is associated with less persistent
inflation), recent gains in price stability can be fragile and potentially eliminated by adverse
price shocks. As an alternative to this view, if pass-through rates decline due to more
structural reasons such as declining pricing power of firms, the recent regime of price
stability may be more robust. Similarly, even without changes in the competitive structures
of industries, the pass-through elasticities on import baskets can change purely in line with
changes in the composition of the import basket if the component products have distinct
pass-through elasticities.
Ultimately, we conclude that while the Taylor argument has some statistical merit
when properly tested, it is not of first order importance for the low and medium inflation
countries of the OECD. First, despite lower inflation in many OECD countries in recent
years, declining exchange rate pass-through into import prices has not been a general feature
of the OECD countries. Levels of pass-through by country are significantly higher in
countries with higher nominal exchange rate variability – consistent with recent theoretical
advances on the optimal choice of invoicing currency -- but largely uncorrelated with levels
of inflation, money growth rates, or aggregate country size. Although changes in some of

3

these macro series are weakly correlated with changes in pass-through, these macro variables
are not of first order importance in explaining pass-through evolution within the OECD over
the past 25 years. Far more important for overall pass-through rates are changes in the
composition of industries in a country’s import basket. In particular, the move away from
energy as a high proportion of the import bundles, to a much higher share for manufactured
products, has been the primary driver behind recent pass-through changes into import prices
among numerous OECD countries.3
The industry composition of trade is more structural than is inflation performance.
Consequently, those OECD countries that have brought down their pass-through elasticities
through changes in trade composition have pass-through reductions (and consequent
implications for monetary policy) that are more robust to the inflation regime. Monetary
policy transmission therefore is expected to be robust to the extent that industry pass-through
rates remain stable, mainly evolving with the product mix of each country’s trade.

Exchange Rates and Prices: Similar Equations, Different Interpretations

Analyses of exchange rates and price linkages have followed numerous paths, ranging from
early macroeconomic debate on exchange rates and monetarism, to market integration or
segmentation associated with the law of one price, to the role of market microstructure in the
ability and desire of producers to price discriminate. Empirical tests of associated hypotheses
revolve around the familiar equation:
Pt = Et Pt*

(1)

where Pt is the domestic price index, Et is the nominal exchange rate (defined as domestic
currency per unit of foreign), and Pt* represents foreign prices. (Relative) purchasing power
parity tests use price indices across countries to test whether this relationship holds. Law of
One Price hypotheses test the same equation for individual goods traded across countries. As
nicely discussed in P. Goldberg and Knetter (1997), costs of transportation or resale (such as

3

Our focus should not be confused with that of related recent papers that attempt to explain the pass-through of
exchange rates into a country´s CPI. In these papers, exchange rate movements lead to import price passthrough. These enter with weights into the aggregate CPI of countries, with the weights possibly to be adjusted
to reflect distribution costs as in Burstein, Neves, and Rebelo (2001) or central bank reaction functions as in
Gagnon and Ihrig (2001).

trade barriers) might preclude price equalization but give rise to a stable wedge between
indices.
Exchange rate pass-through studies consider the extent to which exchange rate
movements are passed-through into traded goods prices, versus absorbed in producer profit
margins or markups. Often these studies look at indices of industrial concentration or market
power to explain pass-through differences or pricing-to-market. The textbook definition of
exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is the percent change in local currency import prices
resulting from a one percent change in the exchange rate between the exporting and
importing country. Evidence on tests of this relationship rely on the γ estimates based on a
simple equation
pt = γ et + ε t

(2)

where all lower-cased variables are in logs and ε is an error term.4 Despite its popularity, this
reduced form equation (whether in log levels or growth rates) is problematic for hypothesis
testing because it represents a non-structural statistical relationship.
The micro-foundations of pricing behavior by exporters are a better starting point for
generating the more economically meaningful specifications that are appropriate for
hypothesis testing. The pricing equation of a exporter from country x -- and its elasticity of
response to an exchange rate movement -- depend on the structure of demand and costs
confronting the exporter. If the import prices of country j, Pt m , j , are the dependent variables,
the pricing rule of the foreign exporters x supplying j is:
Pt m , j = Et Pt x , j = Et Mkuptx , j ( Pt m , j Pt ) C x , j (Wt j , Yt , Et )
where MKUPt x , j ≡

(3)

Pt x , j
, Cwx , j > 0, CEx , j < 0, C yx , j > 0 .
Ctx , j

In equation 3 MKUPt x , j represents the markup rate of prices over costs for the
exporter. Markup rates are industry specific and depend on the demand curve facing
exporters x in country j. This demand depends, in turn, on Pt m , j Pt , the prices of imports

The γ’s are background information for the monetary policy debate discussed in Taylor (2001) and provided in
studies such as McCarthy (2000). While Taylor argues that exchange rate pass-through elasticities appear to
have declined over time for countries that have reduced their inflation levels and inflation variability, there had
not been systematic analysis verifying this assertion.

relative to prices of country j producers. Ctx , j is the marginal cost function of the exporter in
his own currency. This exporter marginal cost function is increasing in export market wages,
Wt x , j , and increasing in country j demand conditions Yt.5 The exchange rate is an argument in
the exporter’s cost function to the extent that the exporter relies on imported inputs or has
other costs that move with the relative value of the destination market currency. 6

where “.” over a variable represents a percentage change. Equation 4 clearly demonstrates
that empirical specifications that seek to isolate pass through elasticities should introduce
controls for the exogenous cost shifters entering into foreign exporter pricing decisions.
Without such controls the measured relationship is a statistical correlation without specific
economic interpretation in terms of exchange rate pass-through.
Further manipulation of (4) gives microfounded intuition behind pass-through
elasticities into import prices. 7 Multiplying through by Et Pt m , j and rearranging terms, the
exchange rate pass through elasticity γ is a function of the markup and foreign marginal cost
elasticities, η and λ :

More precisely, one should include as the appropriate demand variable an index of income levels across the
producer’s home market and the destination market for its exports. Since we do no have information on the
composition of demand facing exporters in different countries, our proxy here is the GDP of the importing
country.

statement is that an exporter that relies more on imported inputs has a smaller share of local
value-added in costs that can fluctuate with exchange rates. Also, exporters facing highly
elastic demand curves will pass-through a lower percentage of exchange rate changes into
destination market prices. An example is the small exporter supplying a large market
populated with local competitors. Clearly, exchange rate pass-through depends on the
structure of competition in the industry, as has been exposited simply and eloquently in
Dornbusch (1987) and Marston (1990), among others, and supported empirically by Knetter
(1993) and Yang (1997).

Exchange Rates and Import Prices: The Evidence

A. The Data and Estimation Methodology.

We capture the arguments of equation (4)

through a log-linear regression specification similar to that tested throughout the exchange
rate pass-through literature: 8
pt = α + δ xt + γ et + ϕ Z t + ε t

(6)

where pt are local currency import prices, et is the exchange rate, xt is a primary “control”
variable representing exporter costs, and Z t is a vector of other controls, including real GDP
of the destination market. Biased estimates of the pass-through coefficient could arise if
foreign wages or GDP are correlated with exchange rates but omitted from the regression.
Our approach considers pass-through into import prices of specific countries, as
opposed to other careful empirical studies of exchange rate pass-through that focus
exclusively on the export prices of individual products or baskets from a single country to a
number of destination markets.9 We pursue the import price approach because it is the more
relevant dependent variable in the debate on the inflationary consequences of exchange rate
fluctuations. Our dependent variables are import unit value indices (aggregated across all
imports, and disaggregated into major industry groups) for 25 OECD countries.

8

P.Goldberg and Knetter (1997) overview the relationships between these studies. Beyond the industrial
organization themes, there also are studies that allow for pass-through elasticities to differ between appreciation
and depreciation periods (Swamy and Thurman 1994) or to be distinct for anticipated versus unanticipated
exchange rate changes (Marston 1990).
9
Knetter (1993), Marston (1990), P.Goldberg and Knetter (1996), and Kasa (1992) use export prices or export
unit values from specific countries to multiple destinations with the intent of identifying price discrimination or
pricing to market activity. While important in cross-country research, price discrimination across markets also is
a theme within countries and across cities. For example, see Engel and Rogers (1996).

7

The OECD compiles quarterly data on import price indices for OECD countries, with
the series commencing around 1975 and ending in 1999. In addition to the country
aggregates, the OECD also reports disaggregated import prices at the country level for five
product categories: Food, Energy, Raw Materials, Manufacturing, and Non-Manufacturing
products. Since we ultimately find that energy pass-through elasticities exhibit anomalous
behavior, we delve further into the prices of disaggregated energy imports. For cross-country
comparisons, data allow for further disaggregation into Steam Coal, Coking Coal, and Crude
Oil (data source: International Energy Agency).
Nominal exchange rates are from the International Financial Statistics (series neu),
defined in our specifications as domestic currency per unit of foreign currencies (1/neu), so
that home currency depreciations appear as increases in the nominal exchange rate series.
The real GDP series used are those of the importing countries (source: International Financial
Statistics). It is more difficult to find a primary control variable that captures the shifting
relative costs of a country’s trading partners. We construct a consolidated export partners
cost proxy by taking advantage of the IFS reporting of both real reu and nominal neu
exchange rate series and computing Wt x , j = neutj ⋅ Pt j reutj by country in our sample. This
gives us a measure of trading partner costs (over all partners x of importing country j), with
each partner weighted by its importance in the importing country’s trade.
For each of these country import price indices, the first stage of our analysis entails
estimating short-run and long-run pass-through elasticities, γ , from equation (6).10 We
estimate these elasticities across 25 countries, and perform tests for structural changes in the
estimated pass-through rates during the sample period. We then run second stage regressions
to explain cross-country and time series differences in pass-through performance with
explanatory variables that include monetary aggregates and also emphasize the importance of
the composition of a country’s import bundle.
The first-stage regressions are specified to generate pass through elasticities and to
follow equation (6), expressed in first-differences, with the addition of lagged exchange rate

10

These elasticities have a direct economic interpretation, in contrast with the statistical measures that would be
generated by an equation such as (2). We nonetheless also generated statistical pass-through elasticities to
determine whether these differed substantially from the elasticities reported in the text. The differences were
sometimes substantial, but were not systematically positive or negative biased across countries.

The estimation methodology applied is ordinary least squares on variables in log
differences, selected after we performed extensive checks on the stationarity of series and on
appropriateness of a cointegration approach.13 We were unable to reject the hypothesis that
the (log) series of import prices, foreign costs, and effective exchange rates were
nonstationary. We performed additional tests to determine whether these three variables were
cointegrated, i.e. whether a linear combination of these variables resulted in a stationary
process.14 Abstracting from the issue of low power of these tests, and despite predictions of
theory, we rejected the cointegration hypothesis and consequently did not apply an error
correction model.

B.

Exchange Rate Pass-Through into Import Prices. Estimates of exchange rate pass-

through into import prices for the OECD countries are presented in Table 1. Taking
unweighted averages across countries, we find that average pass-through into import prices is
11

We include up to three lags of exchange rates and foreign prices/production costs in the regression. Most of
the pass-through response occurs over the first and second lags after an exchange rate change, so the
interpretation of four quarters as long run is empirically validated. An alternative specification, which used a
lagged dependent variable and relied on a partial adjustment model, generated very similar empirical results
(not reported in this version of the paper).
12
While the theoretical antecedents of this equation are log-level relationships among variables, for estimation
the variables in these equations are first-differenced to control for the possibility of unit roots in the time series
variables contained in these specifications.
13
Dickey Fuller Unit root tests on the logarithmic values of the import price, foreign costs, and exchange rate
series in an econometric specification, with time trends, reject the unit root hypothesis at the 5% level in only 3
of 150 instances. This is clearly below the statistical error for 150 specifications, which would be 7.5 rejections.
We therefore accept that the (log) series of import prices, foreign costs, and effective exchange rates are
nonstationary, with the strong caveat that these stationarity tests have low power.
14
We reject that the log real exchange rate is stationary and that the vector (1,1,-1) is a cointegrating vector as
suggested by the theory on the real exchange rate. Of course, if there is a cointegrating vector it may differ
from what this theory predicts. We run a model where p(t) = a + b*e(t) + c*w(t) + u(t), and compute (t) = ρ*
(t-1) + e(t). We test whether the estimated coefficient, ρ, is different from unity, and rejected for only 11 cases

9

0.61 in the short-run and 0.77 in the long-run. These averages mask interesting cross-country
differences in pass-through into import prices. The United States has relatively low passthrough, 26 percent within one quarter and about 41 percent over the longer run. Pass
through estimates for countries such as France, Germany, and Switzerland are closer to 60
percent in the short run and 80 percent over the longer run. Smaller European countries
typically have even higher pass-through rates, but a precise relationship between passthrough and country size is not empirically significant.
A recurrent issue in the macroeconomics literature is the prevalence of local currency
price stability (LCP) versus producer currency pricing (PCP). LCP represents a null
hypothesis of zero pass-through while PCP implies a pass-through of unity. Table 2
summarizes our tests for the existence of local currency pricing, producer currency pricing,
or partial pass-through into import prices.
For countries in the OECD we overwhelmingly reject complete pass-through (or
PCP) and zero pass-through (or LCP) as a description of aggregate import prices in the short
run. Partial pass-through is the best description for import price responsiveness in the first
quarter: elasticities of overall import prices are significantly different from zero in 22 out of
25 countries and significantly different from one for 20 out of 25 countries. In the longer run,
pass-through elasticities are larger and closer to one, although complete pass-through or
producer currency pricing is still rejected in 9 out of 25 countries. Thus, while PCP is better
supported as a longer run characterization, it is still rejected for many OECD countries.
Recently, numerous commentators have speculated that pass-through rates have been
declining. We address this issue directly by performing two types of structural change tests
on the pass-through elasticities. We first assume an exogenously imposed break point in the
middle of the sample and perform Chow tests. In a second set of tests we allow for
endogenously determined structural break points.15

the hypothesis that ρ is different from unity at the 5% level. This is slightly higher than the 7.5 instances that
statistical error would suggest, but still very low.
15
Hansen (2001) provides a good critique of different types of structural change tests.

Average elasticity

In our implementation of the Chow-tests, we compare elasticities estimated over the
first half of the sample, 1977 through 1989, with those from the full sample through 1999.
The results from this split sample approach (shown in the rightmost columns of Table 1 and
summarized in the bottom two rows of the table) tell a mixed story on the direction of change
in pass-through across countries. Short run exchange rate pass-through declined for 16
countries – 4 cases with statistically significant declines– and increased in 8 countries. A
similar pattern appears in the long run elasticities. Thus, while Chow tests suggest that there
has been a tendency toward declines in exchange rate pass-through across OECD countries,
these tests also point to only a limited number of cases where these declines were statistically
significant. Declining pass-through was not evident in the aggregate import prices of the
United States. By contrast, Japan registered large declines in exchange rate pass through into
import prices. Overall, the Chow tests (with mid-point breaks) significantly reject structural
stability for 6 countries of the 25 countries for pass-through coefficients over the aggregate
import price series.
For the second set of stability analyses, we test for the presence of a structural breaks
in pass-through using the method proposed by Andrews (1993) and Andrews and Ploberger

12

(1994). These methods test for the existence of a structural break point in the stated
relationship at some unknown date within the sample period. These tests have the advantage
that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the date in which the structural break
takes place. However, these tests are asymptotic and their power in our context is quite
limited by the number of observations in our import price series (generally around 100
quarters per series). Indeed, as summarized in the last row of Table 3, we can never reject
stability of long run pass-through according to these tests. While short run pass-through
stability is also rejected for 9 countries, it is difficult to assign the timing of instability to a
particular break date, suggesting that the instability is gradual rather than associated with a
distinct point in time. The sample of 9 countries for which stability is indicated overlaps
with, but is not identical to, the Chow test instability countries.

Next, we consider the degree and stability of exchange rate pass-through into the
prices of the five available sub-aggregates of import prices reported by the OECD: Food,
Energy, Raw Materials, Manufacturing Products, and Non-manufacturing Products.16 As
summarized in Table 2, most industries exhibit a striking degree of partial pass-through. For
all product categories with the exception of Energy, we reject the hypothesis of zero
exchange rate pass-through (LCP) for more than half of the countries. For Manufacturing
and Food, we similarly reject complete pass through (PCP). The evidence in support of
16

Appendix Table 1 provides these estimates, by country. Another important issue with respect to monetary
policy is the pass-through comparison for final goods prices versus imported intermediate goods prices
(Obstfeld 2000). Energy and Raw Materials can be viewed as being closer to classification as imported
intermediate goods than Food, Manufacturing, and Non-manufacturing Products.

13

partial pass-through is strongest for Manufacturing imports, for which short run pass-through
differs significantly from both zero and one in 19 out of 24 countries. Food also exhibits
partial pass-through in the short run. Local currency pricing is often rejected for NonManufacturing and Raw Materials, but rejections of producer currency pricing are more
mixed across countries.
The stability of pass-through into disaggregated import prices appears more robust
than the stability into the aggregate import price series. This apparent stability helps provide
a deeper understanding of the sources of fluctuations in pass-through into aggregate import
prices. Indeed, the aggregate import price series could potentially evolve over time because
of changes in the composition of the import bundles, rather than because of changes in the
underlying pass-through elasticities on component products. For the underlying classes of
imports we formally test for the stability of these pass-through elasticities by country. As
summarized in Table 3, we never reject stability of the disaggregated pass-through
coefficients for more than 5 countries, and the number is closer to 2 or 3 in any product
category across 24 countries.17 By contrast, stability is rejected in 9 of the 25 cases for the
aggregate import price series. These results are an indication that exchange rate pass-through
rates for the sub-indices are more stable than the exchange rate pass-through for aggregated
import prices.
Finally, all of our tests showed that Energy imports have the most anomalous
behavior among all the product categories, with country experiences varying considerably.
For Energy imports, pass-through elasticities calculated using effective exchange rates are
noisy, but cluster either around zero (rejected in the short run for only 8 of 24 countries) or
around one (rejected for 7 of 24 countries). Given the noise in the energy estimates of
exchange rate, and the anecdotal evidence that energy markets are highly globally integrated
with prices determined in U.S. dollars, we proceeded to a further examination of the Energy
series. Specifically, we consider three available disaggregates of energy import prices: Oil,
Coking Coal, and Steam Coal.18 Instead of using effective exchange rate series, we examined
pass-through of bilateral local currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The resulting
17

Many of these instances of product category instability are attributed to data from New Zealand and Japan.
Excluding these two countries, the number of countries for which there are rejects in the disaggregated data
typically falls to 1 or 2.
18
See Appendix Table 3 for detailed results. The countries for which Oil import price data is used include:
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, U.K., Greece, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Portugal, and Sweden. We do not report pass-through for the U.S. import
prices, since these tests are for currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.

14

pass-through elasticities were much more precisely estimated for these disaggregated product
categories. As reported in Appendix Tables 3A and 3B, bilateral dollar movements fully
pass-through into local currency Oil prices. Coking Coal and Steal Coal, known to be more
heterogeneous products because of their sulfur content and local standards, exhibit more
varied rates of pass-through across countries. Overall, we again find that partial pass-through
is a common phenomenon particularly among heterogeneous products. More homogeneous
products have more extreme pass-through values.

Exchange Rates and Import Prices: A Macro or Micro Phenomenon?
The previous section demonstrated the prevalence of partial exchange rate pass through

into import prices, and the large cross-country and time-series variation in some elasticities.
In this section we explore the empirical merits of alternative hypotheses posed in recent
debates over the link between macroeconomic variables and pass-through. Given our breadth
of data on aggregated and disaggregated import prices for OECD countries, we also pose an
alternative explanation for time series changes in aggregate import price pass-through.
Specifically, we consider the degree to which changes in aggregate import elasticities are
attributable to movements over time in the composition of OECD imports.

A. Macro determinants of pass-through. Taylor (2000) hypothesized that the decline in
average inflation rates in the developed world has also resulted in a decline in the degree in
which firms pass-through changes in costs into prices for their final goods. By this view, all
else equal, lower inflation leads to lower import price pass-through. The relationship between
more stable monetary policy and pass-through also occurs in recent theoretical work by
Devereux and Engel (2001) and Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2001) on optimal invoicing
currency choice. If exporters set their prices in the currency of the country that has the most
stable monetary policies, import prices in local currency terms would be more stable in
countries with more stable monetary policy. All else equal, exchange rate pass-through
would be higher for countries with more volatile monetary policy.
Another reason for macro variables to influence pass through is due to exporter
competition for market share. As discussed in Froot and Klemperer (1989), exchange rate
pass-through may be lower when nominal exchange rate variability is high and exporters to a
country try to maintain local market share.

15

Country size may be another important factor in ranking pass-through elasticities of
countries. As initially exposited by Dornbusch (1987), exchange rate pass-through may be
higher if the exporters are large in number relative to the presence of local competitors. One
approximation to this point is that pass-through elasticities might be inversely related to
country real GDP. An alternative approach would be to also consider measures of sectorspecific openness for countries.
We test for the importance of these alternative hypotheses by running second stage
regressions over the short-run and long-run pass-through elasticities of OECD countries. The
second stage regression is given by

γ sri or lr = α + β x i + ε i

(8)

where xi is a vector representing all the exogenous regressors: country-specific average
inflation rates, money growth rates, exchange rate volatility, and real GDP during the sample
period. The bivariate and multivariate cross-country regressions use weighted least squares
regressions of short and long run elasticities. In this weighted least squares method, where we
use as weights the inverse of the standard error of the estimated pass-through elasticities,
noisy estimates receive less weight in the second stage specifications.
The time series variables used in constructing the right-hand-side macro variables are
all measured quarterly over the sample period 1975:1 to 1999:4. These variables include:
Money measured as the average annualized growth rate of the money supply (in logs);
Inflation is average annualized inflation rate, based on consumer price indices (in logs).
Exvol is the average of the quarterly squared changes in the nominal exchange rate; GDP: is
the nominal value in national currency deflated using the CPI deflator and converted into
U.S. dollar at the average 1996 nominal exchange rate.
The results of the second stage panel regressions are presented in Table 4. These
cross-country results, which do not have a time series component, show that country-specific
rates of exchange rate pass-through into import prices are not significantly correlated with
inflation or money growth. However, short-run elasticities are correlated with nominal
exchange rate volatility: countries with more nominal volatility have higher pass-through
rates. The result that lower nominal volatility is associated with lower pass-through is
consistent with the main theoretical results of Devereux and Engel (2001) and Bacchetta and
vanWincoop (2001). The role of country size, however, is insignificant in the rankings of
pass-through rates across countries. Despite the observation that U.S. pass-through rates are

16

quite low, across the OECD there is no systematic relationship between pass-through and a
country real GDP. Some large countries have high pass-through (Japan) while some small
countries have low pass-through (Czech Republic).

While these cross-country results are especially interesting for currency invoicing
hypotheses, the tests conducted are not the most appropriate ones for addressing the type of
pass-through endogeneity exposited by Taylor (2000). For satisfying the latter objective, we
abstract from other country-specific determinants of pass-through rates and ask whether
changes to a country’s pass-through elasticities are systematically associated with changes in
macroeconomic performance. The changes approach is particularly relevant since the
macroeconomic indicators introduced in equation (8) have moved substantially during the

17

past three decades for many OECD countries. For example, inflation rates and money growth
were substantially larger during the first part of the sample than during the second.
To capture the observation that the average behavior of some of these exogenous
variables over the full period is not representative of behavior over shorter intervals, we split
the full sample period into four subperiods: 1975:1 to 1980:4, 1981:1 to 1986:4, 1987:1 to
1992:4, and 1993:1 to 1999:4. For each subperiod, we run a first-stage regression of the type
shown by equation (7) and consequently generate four estimates of the short and long-run
pass-through elasticities of aggregated import prices for each country. We then apply a timeseries panel version of equation (8) as the second stage specification. More precisely, we
regress the estimated elasticities (4 per country, 25 countries) against the average value of the
macroeconomic variables for each country during the respective time periods.19 We again use
a weighted least squares procedure to reduce the importance of the noisier parameter
estimates in driving overall conclusions (the weights are the inverse of the estimated standard
error each pass-through). Within this time-series panel approach, the second stage
regressions also include country and time dummies in order to account for other country and
period-specific fixed effects that are not captured for by the exogenous right-hand-side
variables.
The time-series panel results presented in Table 5 show the role of changes in
macroeconomic determinants in driving changes in the short run and long run pass-through
elasticities of OECD countries. Consistent with Taylor’s (2000) arguments, short run passthrough is lower when a country achieves lower inflation, less money growth, or less
exchange rate variability. Lower and more stable monetary conditions induce producers to
pass on a smaller percentage of cost shocks into final goods prices. While money growth and
exchange rate volatility do not appear to be statistically important in these multivariate
regressions, this is mainly due to their high correlation with inflation, which is picking up the
statistical contribution of both terms.
Despite the joint statistical significance of these macroeconomic variables for the
short-run specification, they account for a negligible amount of the variation over time in
pass-through elasticities across countries. The order of magnitude of inflation changes on
pass-through changes is low, especially in the context of inflation ranges observed within the
OECD: a one percentage point increase in the average inflation rate for a country is
associated with a 0.0023 increase in pass-through. Indeed, F-tests show that these macro

18

variables have no explanatory power for long-run pass through rates across our OECD
country sample.

B. The Role of the Composition of Trade. An alternative explanation for changes in
exchange rate pass-through into aggregate import prices may be the changes that have
occurred in the composition of country imports. Composition shifts, operating over passthrough elasticities that differ across types of imports, could deliver changes in the passthrough elasticities on aggregate import prices. If a country shifts the content of its trade
from industries with high pass-through elasticities into industries with lower elasticities, the
country´s aggregate import pass-through elasticities will decline. Conversely, a shift to
higher pass-through products would raise the overall pass-through elasticity of aggregated
import prices.
What is the empirical evidence on the changing composition of trade within the
OECD? A decomposition of imports into the five product categories shows that composition

19

19

changes have been substantial.20 The main force at work has been a tremendous rise in the
relative importance of manufacturing imports, along with a reduction in the relative
importance of energy. In 1980 manufacturing imports comprised more that 50 percent of the
overall (merchandise) import bill for most countries (Appendix Table 4).

The clear

exceptions were countries heavily reliant on imported energy, notably Japan, followed by
Italy and France. Japan also stood out among OECD countries for the relatively large share
of raw materials in its imports. However, due to lower energy prices, changes in energy
policies, and a dramatic growth of manufacturing trade, by the 1990s there was a striking
cross-country shift in the composition of imports. By 1992 manufactured products became
more than 70 percent of the imports of many OECD countries, and often closer to 80 percent
of the import bill. For France, manufactured products grew from 45 to 79 percent of imports.
At the same time these countries experienced a clear decline in the share of energy products
in total imports, as illustrated in Figure 1, and an almost identical increase in the share of
manufacturing Products. Since product categories have distinct (and relatively stable) passthrough rates, this shift in the relative importance of energy and manufacturing products in
import volumes will be shown to account for a significant fraction of the changes observed in
the pass-through elasticities into aggregated import prices across OECD countries.

20

These categories are defined by the availability of cross-country data on import prices.

To empirically determine the importance of import composition for pass-through
rates, we introduce a trade composition effect directly into the time-series panel regressions.
Specifically, for each country and time period we construct an “imputed aggregate passthrough elasticity” which captures the changes in a country’s aggregate pass-through
elasticities specifically attributable exclusively to changes in its composition of imports. The
construct uses the time-invariant (full sample period) estimates of pass-through elasticities
for each of the five industry groupings for each country.

The imputed elasticity is

constructed by varying over the time the weights of each type of import in each country’s
total import bundle. We use as weights the import share values at 1980, 1986, 1992, and
1998.21
The imputed measure tracks reasonably well the pattern of pass-through declines
observed in the actual pass-through estimates for the sample of countries for which
comparisons are possible. The imputed measure generates declines for 10 of the 14 cases
where declines were observed in the actual data. The imputed measure generates passthrough increases in 5 of the 7 cases where increased pass-through was observed in the actual
data.

21

Availability of the appropriate disaggregated import data reduced the number of countries included.

21

The main reason for this decline in the aggregate import price elasticity is due to the
decline in the relative weight in overall imports of energy and raw materials. These are the
two products for which the import price elasticities were often highest. According to this
calculation, the aggregate pass-through elasticity for the United States would have declined
from 0.37 to 0.25 between 1980 and 1998 solely due to the change in the product
composition of imports. For Italy, the decline would have been far more dramatic, from 0.87
to 0.62.

C. Micro v. Macro Determinants of Exchange Rate Pass-Through. As a final exercise,
we run a horse race to statistically contrast the explanatory power of the micro versus macro
variables for exchange rate pass-through movements over time and across countries. For
most countries we have pass-through estimates at four intervals. We have imputed elasticities
(from the disaggregated import data) for the 21 countries that had adequate trade share
decompositions for our purposes. This composition effect is interpreted as a microeconomic
force behind changes in aggregate exchange rate pass-through.
The extended second-stage regression takes the form:
∆γ sr or lr = β1∆ ln moneytj + β 2 ∆ ln inflationtj + β 3∆ ln exchvolt j + β 4 ∆ ln GDPt j
+ β 5∆ ln imputed t j + α i + αt + ν t j

(9)

where country and time dummies are included, and weighted least squares estimation is again
applied. The results are reported in Table 6.
Common time dummies, macro variables and imputed trade shares explain about 20
percent of the observed differences over time in the short-run pass-through elasticities of
countries. The hypothesis of the joint insignificance of the macro variables cannot be rejected
at the one percent level. Almost all of the explanatory power of the regressions comes from
the imputed trade elasticity variables, even though the composition arguments are made with
only the coarsely disaggregated series that are available in the import price data. Trade
composition effects is the clearly dominant explanation for movements over time in the
short-run and long-run sensitivity of import prices to exchange rates.

Conclusions
In this paper we have provided cross-country, time-series, and industry-specific

evidence on the pass-through of exchange rates into import prices across a large sample of
OECD countries. As a cross-country average, import prices in local currencies reflect 60
percent of exchange rate fluctuations in the short run, and nearly 80 percent over the longrun. By contrast, exchange rate pass-through into U.S. import prices is 25 percent in the short
run and 40 percent over the long run. For the OECD as a whole, partial pass-through is
overwhelmingly the best description of import price responsiveness shortly after an exchange
rate movement. In the longer run, pass-through elasticities are closer to one, although
complete pass-through or producer currency pricing is still rejected for many countries.
Macroeconomic variables play a significant but limited role in explaining cross-country
differences in levels of pass-through elasticities. Most notably, pass-through into import
prices is lower for countries with low average inflation and low exchange rate variability.
While there is evidence that pass-through rates have been declining over time in some
countries, this pattern of pass-through decline has not been a common feature of all OECD
countries. Short-run exchange rate pass-through elasticities rise with price inflation (or
23

higher money growth rates). Despite statistical correlations, the quantitative importance of
these macroeconomic effects have been small in the OECD. Recent arguments for virtuous
cycles between inflation, money policy effectiveness and pass-through have not been of firstorder importance within the OECD countries.
Observed changes in pass-through rates into aggregate import prices more closely
reflect changes over time in the composition of import bundles of OECD countries. Passthrough elasticities for manufacturing products and food products are generally partial, so
that both local currency price stability and producer price stability are rejected for most
countries.

By contrast, energy and raw material imports appear to have pass-through

elasticities closer to one. The shift in the import composition toward manufactures and away
from energy and raw materials imports have contributed significantly to pass-through
declines in about half of the OECD countries examined.

These types of changes of pass-

through into import prices –associated with widespread changes in the composition of
industrial activity and trade --- are likely to be more durable than those associated with the
types of changes in macroeconomic policy environments observed in the OECD in recent
decades.

Data Appendix:
OECD import price series
Source: OECD Statistical Compendium. Quarterly time series of import price indices in local
currency for 1975:Q1 to 1999:Q4. For each country prices exist for five different product
categories: Food, Energy, Raw Materials, Manufactures, Non-Manufacturing products. The
countries for which the data exists are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland,
Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Iceland (only aggregate import prices available), Italy, Japan, Republic of
Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey,
United States. 10 of the 27 OECD country series had import price data ending in 1999. 5
countries had data ending in 1998, 1 in 1997, 2 in 1996, and 2 in 1995. We use 25 countries
for the empirical work, excluding Korea, Turkey and Mexico for lack of effective exchange
rate indices.
Effective Exchange Rate Indices
The nominal and real measures are index numbers defined in terms of domestic currency per
units of foreign currency. The real effective exchange rate is calculated from Unit Labour
Costs for developed countries by the IMF. Code in IFS database: neu (reu).
Money Supply:
Defined as money in national currency, seasonally adjusted, with the exception of Sweden
and the U.K: for which we have used a somewhat broader definition (money and quasimoney or M0). International Financial Statistics Code in IFS database: 66
Inflation Rate
Annual inflation rate based on the consumer price indices from the International Financial
Statistics. Code in IFS databse:64.
Disaggregated Energy Prices
Oil prices are the average cost (in dollars/bbl) of total crude imports converted in national
currency using the average quarterly nominal exchange rate. Data is quarterly from 1980:1
to 1999:4. Source: International Energy Agency.
Steam and Coking Coal prices are the import cost (in U.S. dollar/tonne) converted to national
currency using the average quarterly nominal exchange rate. Data is quarterly from 1980:1 to
199:4. Source: International Energy Agency.
