    "abstract": "\n\nWe consider a model in which monetary policy is governed by a Taylor rule. The model has a unique equilibrium near the steady state, but also has other equilibria. The introduction of a particular escape clause into monetary policy works like the Taylor principle to exclude the other equilibria. We reconcile our finding about the escape clause with the sharply different conclusion reached in Cochrane (2011). Atkeson et al. (2010) study a different version of the escape clause policy, but that version is fragile in that it lacks a crucial robustness property.\n\n",
