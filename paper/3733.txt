TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND GROWTH

ABSTRACT
Technology change is modeled as the result of decisions of
individuals and groups of individuals to adopt more advanced

technologies. The structure is calibrated to the U.S. and

postwar Japan growth experiences. Using this calibrated
structure we explore how large the disparity in the effective tax
rates on the returns to adopting technologies must be to account
for the huge observed disparity in per capita income across

countries. We find that this disparity is not implausibly
large.

One need only look at a copy of the World Development Report or the
survey by Summers and Heston 11988] to see how incredibly diverse per capita

income levels are across countries.

Such diversity has not always been a

characteristic of the data, however.

rest of the world tended to be located in Western Europe.

were later followed by the U.S. and Canada.

These countries

Most recently, several

countries centered about the Pacific Rim have made the leap.

Many of the

countries in this latter group have in the process experienced rates of

growth that are spectacular relative to historical

standards.

Some

countries, most notably those of sub-Sahara Africa, have yet to make the
transition.

That there is greater diversity in income levels today than three
centuries ago is clear.

However, it would, we believe, be misleading to

identify this occurrence as a spreading out of the distribution of per
capita Income levels.

Within the set of non—African countries, the recent

trend has been for income levels to move towards the mean.

If spreading

out of the distribution were a characteristic of the data, then it should be

the case that within the set of non-African countries per capita income
levels move away from the mean as well.

Why some countries have been able to make the leap while others have
not, and why amongst those countries having made the transition performances

differ, are, we think, the central issues that confront the field of

economic growth, and the ones in which our current efforts are intended to
resolve.

We believe that a theory, if it is to have any hope of accounting

for these observations, must have as its central focus technological change.

Our view differs from neoclassical growth theory, however, in that we

this change to occur only when individuals, or groups of
individuals, make specific decisions to adopt new technologies.
For us
believe

then, the question of why differences in growth rates and income levels

exist across countries is really a question of why all countries do not
adopt the same technologies at the same time.

While some period of time may elapse before individuals in one country

become aware of a technological discovery in another country, we do not

believe this to be the reason these differences exist.

Most industry

studies suggest that the adoption of a new technology requires investment in

capital, with a substantial fraction taking the form of investment in
intangible capital.

In adopting a computer, for example, a firm must not

only make the necessary investment in hardware and software, but it must

train its personnel in the use of' the new system. This training of personal

represents a substantial diversion of resources away from productive
activities.

Instead, what matters in determining whether a particular technology

will be adopted is the return that the individual, or group of individuals,
making the adopting decision expects to earn on its investment.

There is,

we think, a large body of evidence that indicates that the institutional
arrangements within a country can substantially reduce this return.

The

ways in which these institutional arrangements can reduce this return are
not limited to official government taxes on capital.

We believe that these

taxes" across countries explain the observed

diversity in per capita income levels.

There re many instances where relatively permanent changes in the

institutional arrangements within a country have been associated with
noticeable changes in that country's income level relative to the rest of
the world and sustained, but not permanent, changes in its growth rate.
Before 1980, black peasant farmers in Zimbabwe were forbidden to bring their

crops to markets.

a higher return on their investments by beginning a program where

As a result of these changes, output of cotton,

peanuts, and corn by Zimbabwe's black peasant farmers has more than tripled

over a 10-year period.

These farmers now account for over 607. of the

country's corn production and 507. of the country's cotton production whereas

only 10 years ago, these farmers accounted for only 57. of the country's
total productIon of these commodities (Henry 1990a).

The experience of Zimbabwe is consistent with the finding of L.G.
Reynolds (19831 who traced the development of 41 "Third World Countries'
over the 1850—1980 period.

In all but four countries, Reynolds found that

the period in which each country first experienced a sustained increase in

its level of per capita income directly followed a "signifIcant political
event".

In most all cases, this "significant political event" Involved the

macroeconomic policy to which one can point that would seem capable of
explaining Japan's post World War II experience. We dismiss the argument

that the destruction of plant and machinery associated with Japan's defeat
explains that country's success.

If this were the cause, why then was the

experience of East Germany so poor relative to West Germany over this same
period?

in this sense that the war served as a catalyst for growth.

of "golden growth' was the 1960's.

Japan's decade

This is in contradiction to the

predictions of the neoclassical growth theory that Japan's growth rates
should have been highest in the years directly following the war.

In terms

of Japan's institutional arrangements, change continued to occur well after
the war's end.

One important change occurred in 1960 when labor unions,

which had enjoyed considerable strength during the 1950's due to U.S.
encouragement, collided head on with management.

The result of this

confrontation was that labor unions in Japan became passive, acquiescent,
and conservative.

While Japan's growth rate of per capita income over the second half of

the postwar period has been substantially lower than its growth rate over

the first half of that period, its average annual rate of growth of 6.067.
between 1950 and 1985 is still spectacular relative to historical standards.
That such large productivity gains were realized by Japan, and some other

countries as well, is surely a result of these countries' relative positions

in the world at the time of the change in their institutions.

A poorer

country has the potential to realize large increases in productivity once

the institutional arrangements of that country change so as to allow
individuals to keep more of the returns on their investments, and these new

institutional arrangements are expected by individuals to survive into the
future.

is because poorer countries are most likely to adopt

The return earned by a firm on its investment in capital

depends upon the institutional arrangements associated with the country in
which the firm is located and the firm's current technology (as reflected by

its present stock of intangible capital) relative to the world technology.

Our hope is that such a theory can account for the experiences of most
countries.

Obviously, the length of this paper does not allow for such an

analysis.

11. Model Economy

Much of the groundwork for this theory was laid by Parente 119901. We

use the basic structure of that model, but extend it by introducing a
version of the Lucas span-of—control model

to the production technology so

as to be able to distinguish between labor and capital inputs.

This

extension permits us to match the Parente model to the National Income and
Product Account data.

The Household
The

household is assumed to value a composite commodity made up of a

consumption good, c, and services generated by the stock of household

This

good is viewed in the model as being local in nature (i.e. parks, libraries,

fire and police services, et al).

In order to simplify the analysis, we

assume that the household's utility is additively separable in the composite
commodity and the public good.

The discounted stream of utility over a household's infinite lifetime

The time endowment of the household in every period is one.

In addition

the household is endowed at date 0 with a stock of durables d. To simplify

subsequent analysis and notation we assume that this initial stock is the
same for all households. The stock of durables is assumed to depreciate at

a rate of '5d.

The Firm

For each household there corresponds a firm that at any date that

household can manage if it chooses to do so. 2 Each firm at date 0 has

associated with it an initial technology level A and an initial stock of
tangible capital K. For simplicity, we assume that A0 and K are the same

InstItutional Arrangements
As

this theory is intended to be one of growth and not one of

institutional arrangements, we are not concerned with the exact manner by

which these arrangements reduce the return that an individual, or group of

individuals, adopting a new technology earns on its• investment, only that
these institutional arrangements reduce this return.

For this reason we

simply treat a country's institutional arrangements as a tax on the returns

to tangible and intangible capital in the business sector.

In contrast,

It depreciates only in the

sense that over time, as the level of world technology increases, its price
falls.

It is very easy to think of ways in which these taxes are redistributed
or dissipated.

Within the lesser developed countries of the world, a large

percentage of these, tax receipts tend to be pocketed by government
officials.

Henry (1990.b], for example, reports that in Tanzania corruption

within the government is so excessive that Tanzanians refer to government
spending programs as "public air" because the money supposedly marked for

these projects is rarely spent on such projects. To be concrete, we assume

that all such tax receipts are used to provide the Local public good.

Our

results would not change if we were to assume some or all of these goods
were used in unproductive ways. The technology for producing this good is

assumed to be such that one unit of tax revenue results in one Unit of the
public good.

In light of this redistributional scheme and the tax revenues given by
equations (161 and (17), the resource constraint for our economy is

The Competitive Equilibrium
A

household at each date either manages a firm or supplies work

elsewhere in the economy. We permit households to go from being managers to

workers and vice a versa between any two periods. However, since capital is

firm specific, a firm that is not managed in a given period is assumed to

lose both its tangible and intangible capital stocks.

Furthermore, we

assume that a firm's capital stocks can only be increased if a manager is on
hand in the preceding period to make the investments. Thus, any time a firm

is started up again by its manager, its output in that period is zero. Let
Indicate whether a firm is or is not managed in period t. A value of 1

for m indicates that the firm is managed in period t while a value of 0
indicates that the firm is not managed in period t. The problem facing a

value must have debts at date 0 just large enough so that its initial wealth

sufficiently small present value must have claims at date 0 just large
enough so that their individual initial wealths are also V0.

upon the assumption that the

institutional arrangements of the U.S. and Japan were identical in 1950 and
have not changed since. Thus, the only difference, assumed to exist between

the two countries lies in their 1950 capital stocks.

The calibration of the

model to the experience of Japan, considers the off—steady state properties

of the system while the calibration of the model to the U.S. National Income

and Product Accounts considers only the steady state properties of the
model.

The observations pertaining to the calibration of the model to

Japan's postwar experience are taken from the Summers and Heston data set.

Some variables in our model do not correspond exactly to those measured
in either the National Income and Product Accounts or the Summers and Heston
survey.

Most notably is the failure of U.S. National Income and Product

Accounts to measure the stock of intangible capital and investment in that
capital.

For this reason, output in our model will differ from the numbers

reported in the National Income and Product Accounts by the amount of
investment in intangible capital.

In light of the specification of our economy, other adjustments to the
National Income and Product Accounts are called for as well.

structures as part of household capital, such an adjustment seems
appropriate.

Given that final real estate services product is approximately

10 percent of GNP, measured output in our model , y-x, is

.9OGNP.

Second, we separate consumption expenditures on durables from consumption

expenditures on non-durables and services and include the former in the
category of investment in household capital.

Third, we remove residential

investment from gross private investment, and add it to the category of
investment in household capital.

Fourth, we assign 10 percent of government

purchases to investment in tangible business capital.

This we do because

public investments in infrastructure increase private business productivity.
The remaining fraction of government purchases is identified with household
consumption of the local public good in the model.

Therefore, there is the question of

Our economy is a closed system.
19

how to treat net exports listed in the National Income and Product Accounts.

We simply choose to increase real GNP by the amount of net exports, and
assume that for each expenditure category, the expenditure on net exports
increases the expenditure category by the same percentage

as net exports

increases GNP.

After making such adjustments, the ratio of Consumption to measured GNP

for the U.S. in 1987 is .54, the ratio of investment in durables to measured
GNP is .15, the ratio of investment in tangible capital to measured GNP is
.14, and the ratio of consumption of the public good to measured GNP is .17.

In addition to these statistics, the model is calibrated to the ratio of
nonhousehold tangible capital to measured GNP, to the ratio of household

capital to measured GNP, to the

U.S. steady state growth rates of per

capita consumption and output, to the real return on equity in the U.S. over

the postwar period, and to business tangible capital share of output less
investment in intangible business capital.

The ratio of tangible business capital to measured GNP in the U.S. is
approximately 1.25.

With the capital of the government, we believe a ratio

of 1.75 for nonhousehold tangible capital to measured GNP is reasonable.
The ratio of the stock of household capital to measured GNP for the U.S. is
approximately 1.25. Using the Summers and }-Ieston data, the growth rate of
both per capita output and consumption in the U.S. is approximately 27.. The

real return on equity in the U.S. over the postwar period is 6.57..
The share parameter for tangible capital Sk for our model economy is
(28)

Sk

(rk + .).k/(y — x).

To compute the counterpart of this statistic for the U.S. economy we proceed

as follows: To estimate the numerator of (28) we subtract from .90GNP our

20

estimates of payments to labor.

In payments to labor we include all

compensation of employees, fraction

of entrepreneur income, fraction

of surplus on government enterprises, and 50 percent of indirect business
taxes. Our resulting estimated value of Sk is .25.

The preference parameters whose values are selected to match these

steady state observations are the relative rate of risk aversion o, the
consumption share parameter 4> in the utility function, and the subjective

time discount factor .

substitution in consumption between c and c+1 equals the marginal rate of

the model to the ratio of consumption expenditures to the stock of household

capital for the U.S. in 1987, we do find that the ratio of consumption to
the stock of household capital corresponding to our parameterized model is
quite close to this ratio for the U.S.

The technology parameters whose values are to be chosen are 7, 0, ,
K

• and ad . In addition, the tax rates, Kr and tz• must be chosen.

Since

the growth rate of per capita output for the U.S. over the 1950-1985 period
21

was approximately 27.,

a, and & must satisfy equation (13) for a growth

equal to .02.

As long as tangible capital is paid its marginal

Decause we calibrate

the model to k=25 where s=(r+).kJ(y_x) our selection for 8 must
satisfy 8(y-x)/y=.25.
The parameter a has important implications for how fast a country will

approach its steady state. We are not aware of any existing studies which

would restrict the range of values for a. Nor can the value of a be tied
down within the model using U.S. data alone, but by using the Japanese data

as well and considering the off—steady state properties of the model, the
value for a can be pinned down.

For the institutional "tax" on business tangible capital, t, we select

a rate of 1/3. This is approximately equal to the ratio of total revenues
in 1985 from all tangible capital taxation to total tangible capital income
calculated by Lucas U9891.

For the institutional 'tax" on intangible

capital, t, we treat it symmetrically and set it to 1/3.
Capital consumption allowance with capital consumption adjustment in
1987 was roughly 127. of total output.

If this entire amount corresponded to

depreciation on capital in the business sector it would imply an annual
depreciation rate of roughly 9.57. on this capital stock.

It is not clear,

however, how much of this corresponds to depreciation on household capital

and how much corresponds to depreciation on non—household capital, It is,

further, unclear as to how much depreciation in the household's capital
stock goes unmeasured.

For these reasons, we do not believe an annual

depreciation rate on tangible capital and a depreciation rate on durables of
roughly 87. is unreasonable.

chosen.

First a set of parametric values for the model is

Once this selection is made, the steady state solution is

calculated and this solution is Compared to the steady state ratios for the
U.S. listed above,

If a solution is not inconsistent with these statistics,

we then proceed to determine whether the model, with that particular set of
parametric values, can account for the postwar experience of' Japan.

This

experience was that Japan per capita income increased from 1/6th to 3/4ths
of the U.S. level in the 1950-1985 period.

We use the methods of dynamic programming to determine the optimal
policy functions corresponding to the system described by (26).

Once these

functions are found, we trace out the optimal path for a country which
begins with roughly 1/6th of its steady state income in 1950.

If we find

that after a 36 year period, the per capita income level for this artificial
economy is not approximately 3/4ths of its steady state level, we consider a
new set of parametric values, and begin the experiments again.

The parametric values that seem to provide the best fit to the U.S.
steady state observations and the postwar experience of Japan are listed in
Table I.

Table II compares the steady state solution of the model with the

observation for the U.S., while Figure 1 plots the off—steady state path

traced by the model to the actual path for Japan.

As both Table II and

Figure 1 demonstrate, the model's fit is quite good.

IV. Level Effects

The most striking feature of the data is the tremendous diversity in
per capita income levels that exists across countries.

A crucial test of a

theory of growth is whether it can account for this diversity. Our theme is

that this diversity is the result of the differences in taxes" imposed by a
23

countrys institutional arrangements on the return to the investment of an
individual or group of individuals adopting a more advanced technology.
To

determine

the

level

effects

associated

with

a

country's

institutional arrangements, we simply calculate the steady state solution to
the model for various tax rates keeping all other parameters to their values
of Section III.

Table Ill reports the steady state income levels for pairs

of tax rates It k,rz).

As

can be seen from the table, differences in the

taxes imposed by a country's institutional arrangements can result in large
differences in steady state income levels.

Differences in tax rates, for

example, of a factor 3 can lead to differences in steady state per capita
output of a factor 84.

As the table also indicates, the tax on the return to intangible
capital is associated with much larger level effects than the tax on the
return to tangible capital.

Holding the tax rate on tangible capital fixed

and changing the tax rate on intangible capital by roughly a factor 3 result

in level effects of roughly a factor 25. Holding the tax rate on intangible

capital fixed and changing the tax rate on tangible capital by a factor 3,
however, only result in level effects of roughly a factor 3.

V. Conclusion

It is clear that the model proposed here is not one of endogenous
growth.

While growth arises because of specific decisions by agents to

adopt more advanced technologies, neither preference parameters nor policy

parameters affect growth rates.
model, and not a deficiency.

However, we see this as a virtue of the

If savings rates had growth rate effects then

the distribution of per capita income across countries would have to spread

24

out over time. This we do not see in the data.

For us then, a crucial feature of a model is that the level effects
generated within it be large enough to account for the huge observed
disparity

in per capita incomes across countries and that the implied

disparity in relevant parameters generating these level effects not be
inconsistent with observation.

Our theme is that differences in effective

tax rates on the returns to technology adoption across countries are
fundamental to understanding the huge diversity in per capita incomes. Our

model, calibrated to the postwar growth experiences of the U.S. and Japan

can account for this tremendous diversity with, what we think, is an
entirety plausible implied range of tax rates.
Plausible,

however,

is not quantitatively meaningful.

What is

desperately needed is measurement of these returns across countries.

Given

the success of this theory and given the vast amount of anecdotal evidence

that suggests that a country's institutional arrangements affect its
economic performance, our hope is that effort and research will be directed
to this endeavor.

an extension to coalition management, see Prescott and Boyd (1987).

For most countries in the world, it seems entirely appropriate to
assume that their policy has negligible effects on the stock of knowledge.

For those few countries whose policies do significantly affect this stock,
we refer to the stylized fact pointed out by Romer [19871 that over the past

several centuries the world's productivity leader has very rarely been the

Clearly,

some of a firm's tangible capital stock such as its vehicles,

capital stock as firm specific, however, we greatly simplify the notation

model.
