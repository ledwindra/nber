    "abstract": "\n\nWe use credit report data to study consumer financial distress in America. We show there are large, persistent disparities in financial distress across regions. To understand these patterns, we conduct a \u201cmovers\u201d analysis. For collections and default, there is only weak convergence following a move, suggesting these types of distress are not primarily caused by place-based factors (e.g., local economic conditions and state laws) but instead reflect person-based characteristics (e.g., financial literacy and risk preferences). In contrast, for personal bankruptcy, we find a sizable place-based effect, which is consistent with anecdotal evidence on how local legal factors influence personal bankruptcy.\n\n",
