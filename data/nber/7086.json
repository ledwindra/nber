    "abstract": "\n\nProfit on proprietary research tools is determined partly by the remedies for infringement, such as damages and injunctions.  We investigate how damages under a liability rule and the opportunity for injunctions under a property rule can affect the incentives to develop research tools.  We show that the prevailing legal doctrine of damages under liability rule, called lost profit or reasonable royalty, suffers from a logical circularity which leads to an indeterminacy in permissible damages.  This can create insufficient incentives to develop research tools.  Incentives can be improved either by a property rule with injunctions or by a liability rule under the doctrine of unjust enrichment.\n\n",
