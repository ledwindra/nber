Introduction
At least since Nelson (1959) and Arrow (1962), economists have been aware that

competitive markets may fail to provide the socially optimal level of R&D investment.
Technological innovation is beset by uncertainty, imperfect monitoring and imperfect property
rights that lead many to conclude that R&D investment by private firms is too low (Griliches,
1998; Romer, 1990). In this context, special attention is paid to the role of small, entrepreneurial
firms since such firms may be particularly susceptible to the capital and product market
imperfections identified by Arrow and Nelson. Specifically, technology-based entrepreneurs
may be unable to raise R&D investment capital (Kamien and Schwartz, 1982; Holmstrom, 1989)
and be poorly positioned to extract the social value created by their innovations (Teece, 1987;
Anton and Yao, 1994).
From an empirical perspective, perhaps the most puzzling fact about innovation by small
technology-based firms is how concentrated it is among a small number of economic sectors.
Even after limiting attention to sectors which experience high overall rates of R&D investment
and innovation, only a small subset of these sectors are associated with high rates of R&D
investment innovation by small, entrepreneurial firms (National Science Foundation, 1999). For
example, during the rapid increase in the level of venture capital financing during the 1990s, VC
expenditures have been targeted at a relatively narrow set of sectors, such as software
development, telecommunications, and biotechnology (Kortum and Lerner, 1998).

These

patterns raise a critical question: what are the drivers of inter-industry variation in small firm
R&D financing?

2

We address this question by considering three (not mutually exclusive) forces:
technological opportunity, appropriability and capital constraints. To the extent that economic
sectors vary according to these factors, R&D expenditures and realized rates of technological
innovation will vary accordingly. For example, at a given point in time, some sectors may
experience higher levels of technological opportunity (i.e., the ability to generate an innovation
of a given social value for a given level of expenditure); it should not be surprising that these
sectors are associated with the highest rates of R&D investment and realized innovation. Indeed,
most prior analyses of the skewed distribution of R&D expenditures have focused on variation in
the level of technological opportunity as the “culprit” for uneven financing and rates of
technological change among economic sectors (Schmookler, 1966; Rosenberg, 1974; Adams,
1990).1
However, particularly when considering the distribution of innovative activity by smaller,
more entrepreneurial, firms, concentration may also result from differences in the salience of
either product market imperfections (i.e., appropriability) or capital market imperfections (i.e.,
capital constraints). Appropriability is the degree to which technological innovation results in
spillovers to consumers or more established firms, thus limiting the extent to which an innovator
extracts the marginal social product associated with their innovation. Small firms face particular
appropriability problems, either because they are less likely to possess “complementary assets,”
such as a brand-name reputation, a distribution system, or installed base (Teece, 1987), or
because of their relative inability to obtain complete intellectual property for their innovations
(Anton and Yao, 1994; Gans and Stern, 2000). To the extent that sectors differ substantially in
terms of the importance of complementary assets or the strength of intellectual property, it is
1

Most quantitative work in this area attempts to analyze whether publicly financed basic research provides a spur to
private R&D expenditures by increasing the level of technological opportunity in specific areas (Adams, 1990;

3

likely that sectors with low levels of appropriability will be associated with the lowest levels of
investment and innovation by small research-oriented firms.2
Finally, R&D investment may be constrained by capital market imperfections (i.e.,
contracting problems between investors and inventors). By its very nature, R&D investment by
external investors engenders information asymmetries and contractual incompleteness between
the financier and the research firm (Kamien and Schwartz, 1982; Holmstrom, 1989). Among
other concerns, contractual incompleteness can result in (a) inefficient effort provision by the
research firm (Aghion and Tirole, 1994; Hellman, 1998a), (b) the potential for hold-up by the
research firm of the investors (Anand and Galetovic, 1999) or (c) an adverse selection problem
whereby external investors cannot distinguish between profitable and unprofitable projects
(Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981; Hubbard, 1998). To the extent that the salience of these imperfections
for small firms varies across different industrial segments, R&D expenditures and the level of
technological innovation will reflect this variation.3
The goal of this paper is to develop and implement an empirical framework that begins to
disentangle these alternative sources of inter-industry variance. Specifically, we derive a test for
the presence of variation in the salience of capital and product market imperfections across
industrial segments, while simultaneously allowing for controls for the level of technological

Toole, 1999; Hall, 1999).
2
While several researchers have attempted to document both the extent of inter-industry variation in appropriability
and the variation in the mechanisms used to appropriate the rents from innovation in different industries (Levin, et.
al., 1987; Cockburn and Griliches, 1988; Klenow, 1996; Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh, 2000), prior research tends to
focus on the appropriability conditions facing larger established firms (for which data has been more readily
available). Moreover, because the analysis focuses on projects which are themselves funded by the private sector,
these prior analyses have not disentangled the relative salience of technological opportunity, capital market
imperfections, and appropriability.
3
Prior empirical work on the impact of capital market imperfections focuses on the sensitivity of R&D expenditures
to measures of capital liquidity (e.g., measures of firm’s cash flow), both for broad samples of firms (Hall, 1992;
Hao and Jaffe, 1993; Geroski, 1994) as well as for studies specifically focused on smaller firms where capital
constraints may be more likely to bind (Himmelberg and Petersen, 1994). However, prior research has not linked
capital constraints to the sectoral concentration of R&D funding.

4

opportunity for individual R&D projects. In so doing, our results shed light on the sources of the
concentration of small-firm R&D financing.
Our test relies on evaluating the empirical relationship between the performance of R&D
projects performed by small firms but subsidized by the Federal government (more specifically,
through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program) and the level of private
finance for small firm venture financing in those sectors.4 After controlling for technological
opportunity, if subsidized project performance is highest in those sectors where private funding
is lowest, this suggests that differences in funding across segments are, at least in part, the result
of differences in capital constraints. Alternatively, if subsidized project performance is highest
in those sectors where private funding is high, this suggests that differences across segments are
the result, at least in part, of variation in the level of appropriability.
Consider two extreme examples. First, suppose the only differences across sectors are
from variation in the salience of capital market imperfections (i.e., there is no variation in the
level of appropriability or technological opportunity). In this environment, the lowest level of
private R&D financing will be associated with sectors most constrained by imperfections in the
capital market. As well, the most promising projects that go unfunded by the private sector (i.e.,
“marginal” projects) will be associated with these same under-funded sectors. If the subsidy
program targets these “marginal” candidates, there will be a negative relationship between the
sector-specific average performance of subsidized projects and the sector level of private
financing.

4

By examining performance differences across subsidized projects, this paper differs from prior attempts to evaluate
inter-sectoral differences in the environment for small-firm R&D. By and large, such studies have analyzed samples
that are subject to an important selectivity – they have indeed been funded by the private sector (Mansfield, 1995;
Griliches, 1998; Hall, 1988; Hall, 1992; Himmelberg and Petersen, 1994) and so it is difficult to isolate the
differences in capital market imperfections from more downstream issues such as the appropriablity regime.

5

On the other hand, consider an environment in which differences across sectors are
driven solely by variation in the level of appropriability. In this case, sectors with the highest
level of private funding will be associated with the highest level of appropriability. At the same
time, high-appropriability sectors will offer the most attractive “marginal” candidate projects for
the subsidy program. Consequently, under this scenario, there will be a positive correlation
between average sector-level project performance and the level of private investment at the
sector level. As we show in Section III, it is possible to consider variance in both capital
constraints and appropriability at the same time: if the SBIR funds projects “on the margin” then,
under the simplest functional form, the correlation between subsidized project performance and
the level of funding is equal to the difference in the variance associated with appropriability and
the variance associated with capital constraints.5
We explore these ideas using a novel dataset of SBIR-funded projects.6 As described
further in Section V, the survey identifies performance measures at the project level and
incorporates detailed controls for firm size, organizational and financial structure, and the
commercialization strategy associated with each innovation.

The main empirical exercise

evaluates the relationship between project-level performance and the level of private venture
financing in the industrial sector to which each project belongs. Our principal finding is that
project-level performance is strongly positively correlated with the level of private venture
capital. Even after incorporating various controls (including two distinct measures to control for
technological opportunity), a doubling of the level of private venture capital is associated with
5

Section III also highlights several limitations associated with this test (along with potential remedies), including the
importance of (a) controlling for technological opportunity, (b) accounting for the SBIR project selection
mechanism and (c) the direct impact of subsidy financing on project performance.
6
As such, our approach differs substantially from prior work on the SBIR (in particular Lerner (1996) and Wallsten
(2000)). Both of these prior studies seeks to identify the incremental benefits of an SBIR grant relative to privately
funded research; in contrast, we examine the differences across funded firms in order to understand how different
segments differ in terms of the environment for innovation for smaller firms.

6

over a 50% increase in expected project performance.

Simply put, the most successful

subsidized projects are in those industrial segments that have attracted a high rate of private
investment.

Consistent with our framework, we interpret these results as suggesting that

industrial sectors vary in their degree of appropriability for research-oriented small businesses; in
other words, variation in appropriability helps explain the relative concentration of venture
capital activity in a small number of industrial segments.

II.

The Concentration of R&D and Venture Capital Expenditures
Our starting point is the concentration of venture financing among industrial segments.

Consider first the concentration of privately funded R&D expenditure. Figure 1A presents the
Lorenz distribution of R&D funding relative to value added across the manufacturing sector of
the U.S. economy.7 Relative to the distribution of aggregate economic activity (even confined to
the manufacturing sector), a small share of sectors (such as the pharmaceutical, computer
equipment, and transportation industries) account for most of privately financed R&D (e.g., the
Gini coefficient is .60).
This relative concentration of innovative investment becomes even more pronounced
when one examines venture capital financing or the financing of R&D in small and mediumsized firms. Using data drawn from Kortum and Lerner (1998), Figure 1B compares the relative
distribution of venture financing by industrial segment relative to the (already concentrated)
privately financed R&D investment. Though there are difficulties in uniquely assigning venture
capital investments into specific SIC-oriented sectors, Figure 1B suggests that, even among

.

7

R&D-intensive sectors, a very small number receive a very high share of the overall funds from
venture capital sources (here the Gini coefficient is .54).8 Taken together, Figures 1A and 1B
suggest that the concentrated nature of investment by small firms is not merely driven by
difference in raw technological opportunity (which would presumably be reflected in the
aggregate R&D distribution shown in 1A) but depend on the ability of small firms to attract
finance for risky but potentially valuable innovation investments and their ability to translate
their technological success into private economic returns (thus accounting for the additional
concentration present in 1B). The remainder of this paper develops an empirical framework
testing for the presence of two alternative drivers of this “excess” concentration: appropriability
and capital constraints.

III.

A Simple Model of Sector-Level Variation in Innovative Expenditure
This section derives a test for the sources of variation among sectors resulting in the

concentrated nature of venture financing activity. Our test relies on the association between the
performance of government-subsidized projects and the level of private financing available in
different economic sectors. We demonstrate that, if variation in capital constraints is important
for understanding differences across sectors, the average performance of SBIR grantees is likely
to be negatively associated with observed levels of venture capital funding. This is because the
funding mechanism identifies high potential performers only in industries where those are not
otherwise likely to be funded. Alternatively, a positive association between average performance
and venture capital funding will be indicative of the relative importance of appropriability as
8

Indeed, while economists have mostly ignored this observation, its validity is a widely accepted and welldocumented feature of the venture finance industry (www.ventureone.com). As well, similar concentration is

8

explaining differences across industries in terms of small firm research financing. To derive this
empirical test, we first develop a model of the equilibrium level of private funding for small firm
research in the presence of both appropriability and capital constraints and then derive the
implications for the performance of subsidized projects. In addition, our discussion highlights
several potential limitations (and associated remedies) for our proposed test, including those
arising from (a) the importance of controlling for technological opportunity (b) alternative
funding mechanism for SBIR project selection and (c) the direct impact of government subsidy
on project performance.

Players, Payoffs and Choice Variables
Our model focuses on the relationship between funding and performance of research
projects undertaken by independent research units (each is denoted as an RU). A single RU, j,
can potentially engage in R&D for a single project requiring a single unit of capital investment.
Capital financing may be provided by two sources: a venture capitalist (VC) or by a government
subsidy. We assume that the capital contribution of the VC is contractible and competitive (i.e.,
there are a potentially large number of homogenous VCs who contemplate financing RU
projects). If the project is financed, a commercializable innovation is generated with probability
p. p may be endogenous, in that the success probability may depend on either the effort or ability
(type) of RU j.
If the R&D project is technologically successful, the innovation creates a total social
value, Vj, of which the RU (and their equity partners) appropriate v j (V j , γ i ) where γi
parameterizes the ‘distance’ between Vj and vj in industry i. vj(.) is assumed to be non-decreasing
observed for R&D expenditures by small-to-medium sized businesses (National Science Foundation, 1999;

9

in Vj and γi. γi therefore measures the level of appropriability in industry i. Of course, there are
many potential determinants of γi, including the strength of intellectual property and ease of
technological imitation (Arrow, 1963; Anton and Yao, 1994), the degree of product market
competition (Kremer, 1998), and asymmetries among innovators and competitors in the
ownership of “complementary assets” necessary for effective commercialization (Teece, 1987;
Bresnahan, Stern, and Trajtenberg, 1997).

Variation in each of these factors can result in

differential levels of appropriability for independent RUs, insofar as each may increase the
“wedge” between the private and social returns associated with innovation.
As well, for each industry i, there is a distribution of the total social returns across
potential projects. Specifically, we assume that each project is drawn from an industry-level
distribution that is uniform over [0,Vi ] . By construction, then, a shift in Vi is equivalent to
shifting out the level of technological opportunity in industry i.

The Level of VC Funding
The equilibrium level of private venture finance in industry i will be determined by the
measure of projects whose private expected benefits exceed the marginal private cost of project
funding. We assume that, for each industry i, these costs are determined according to c( Fi ,θ i )
where Fi is the total level of industry funding, θi parameterizes the industry-specific difference
between the private and social cost of capital, and c(.) is non-decreasing in both Fi and θi. That
is, the supply curve of capital for RU projects is (potentially) upward-sloping and, relative to the
socially efficient schedule, the impact of capital market imperfections is to shift upward the
supply schedule of capital.
tabulations available from the authors).

10

This is obviously a reduced-form specification; the net impact of imperfections in the
capital market reflects more specific contracting hazards between investors and inventors,
including (a) inefficient effort provision as the result of imperfect monitoring (Holmstrom, 1989;
Aghion and Tirole, 1994; Hellman, 1998a), (b) inefficient grouping of projects with different v
as the result of imperfect observability of project quality (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981) and (c)
potential ex-post expropriation of the rents from innovation by the investors as the result of
imperfect property rights over the inventor’s knowledge (Anton and Yao, 1994; Gans and Stern,
2000). In Appendix A, we demonstrate that, consistent with our characterization, each of these
individual effects results in raising the private cost of capital above the social cost of capital;
however, since we do not disentangle the differential impact of each of these more nuanced
mechanisms in the empirical work, here we aggregate these effects into the single index of the
level of imperfections in the capital market, θi.
The demand for capital from VCs is determined by the distribution of expected private
returns for projects, pvj, and so will be downward-sloping as the result of the distribution of
project quality. The equilibrium level of funding will be determined by the interaction between
private capital demand and the upward-sloping marginal cost of funding (see Figure 2). The
number of funded projects, Fi, is determined by the distribution of project value in the industry;
the social value of the marginal project is equal to Vˆi = Vi − Fi . This relationship allows us to
derive how the equilibrium level of funding and marginal expected performance relate to the
structural parameters of the model:
pvˆi (Vi − Fˆi , γ i ) = c( Fˆi ,θ i )

(1)

11

In terms of total funding, Fˆi (Vi , γ i ,θ i ) is increasing in Vi and γi but falling in θi. That is, an
increase in technological opportunity ( Vi ) or appropriability (γi) shift demand and hence Fˆi
upwards, while an increase in capital imperfections (θi ) shifts supply upward, reducing Fˆi . Of
course, since projects are undertaken only if pv j (V j , γ i ) ≥ c( Fi ,θ i ) , the level of private
investment will be less than socially desirable as long as there are any capital market
imperfections or less-than-perfect appropriability.
Expected marginal project performance ( pvˆi (Vi − Fˆi (V ,θ i , γ i ), γ i ) ) will also be sensitive
to the degree of capital imperfections and the level of appropriability. While greater capital
market imperfections will be associated with higher vˆi (as the result of upward shifts of the
capital supply curve along the capital demand curve), lower levels of appropriability will be
associated with lower expected marginal project returns (as the result of movement downward
along the capital supply curve).

Marginal Project Performance and Private Funding Levels
These comparative statics allow us to derive our test for the presence of alternative
sources of variance across industrial segments.

On the one hand, while the expected

performance of the “marginal” project in industry i, pvˆi , is increasing in the level of capital
constraints (θi), low levels of appropriability are predicted to be associated with lower
performance levels for the marginal project. On the other hand, both capital and product market
imperfections will contribute to lower levels of overall private funding ( Fˆi ). As a result, after
controlling for technological opportunity, the sign of the correlation between private funding and

12

marginal project performance provides a test for the presence of variance in either the level of
capital constraints or appropriability across multiple economic sectors.
Proposition 1. Consider a set of industries where the level of private funding and marginal
project performance are determined according to (1). Then
(a)
If Var(γ i ) = 0 , Cov[vˆi , Fˆi | Vi ] ≤ 0
(b)
If Var(θ ) = 0 , Cov[vˆ , Fˆ | V ] ≥ 0
i

i

i

i

In other words, if there is no variance in the level of appropriability (capital constraints), then,
after controlling for the level of technological opportunity, the correlation between private
funding levels and marginal project performance will be non-positive (non-negative).
Consequently, a finding of a positive (negative) correlation allows us to reject
Var(γ i ) = 0 (Var(θ i ) = 0) .
Proposition 1 follows from the fact that if only θi varies (and there is no variance in
appropriability and we control for technological opportunity), then the industry equilibrium pairs
(vˆi , Fˆi ) lie along a single capital demand curve. As a result, increasing the level of capital
constraints will be associated with increases in the performance of marginal projects alongside
decreases in the overall level of funding (and conversely for the case of variance in (γi).
Moreover, if we are willing to assume specific functional forma for c(.) and v(.) we can
extend Proposition 1 and derive the structural relationship inherent in the covariance between
industry-level R&D funding and marginal project performance. In the simplest (linear) case, the
covariance of Fˆi and vˆi is negatively correlated if and only if the variance of θi exceeds the
variance in pv(.) (and vice versa).
Proposition 2. Suppose that c( Fi ,θ i ) = Fi + θ i and v(Vi , γ i ) = Vi − (α − γ i ) and that Vi , γi and θi
are independent random variables and γ i ∈ [0,α ] . Then the correlation between marginal

An Empirical Test for the Presence of Variance in the Level of Appropriability and/or Capital
Constraints
To translate Propositions 1 and 2 into a concrete empirical test, we need to identify
measures of the equilibrium pair ( Fˆi , vˆi ) across different industries.

In that regard, given a

selection of industrial segments, Fˆi , the level of private R&D financing (for small firms), is
readily observable. However, if the sample of projects are funded and performed by the private
sector, it will be difficult (if not infeasible) to identify a measure for vˆi , the performance of the
“marginal” project for each industry. Since private R&D financing is provided to projects which
exceed the funding criterion, only a small set will be “on the margin” in terms of funding
viability in any given industry. Instead, we propose to use the performance of projects that are
subsidized by the government but performed by small and medium sized firms in the private
sector as our measure of vˆi , namely a set of SBIR-funded projects.
From a public finance perspective, an efficient R&D subsidy program specifically funds
projects that satisfy the social but not the private criterion for investment. As a result, to the
extent that a government program funds projects also considered by the private sector, then,

14

under efficient funding, subsidized projects will consist of those just below the private funding
threshold (i.e., the marginal projects in each industrial segment). Even if the government does
not specifically seek to identify marginal projects but offers a funding source which is “less
preferred” than private venture finance, then the government will once again end up subsidizing
those projects which just miss out on private funding. As well, by examining the SBIR (a
subsidy program specifically targeted at R&D financing for small firms), we implement our test
in order to evaluate the constraints on small firm financing (i.e., we examine the covariance
between private venture finance for small firms and the performance of SBIR projects). In so
doing, our examination focuses on an area where variation in appropriability and capital
constraints are particularly important (for small firms) in contrast to the more general pattern of
technological opportunity that may be driving the concentration of aggregate R&D expenditures.
Consequently, the performance of projects resulting from a subsidy aimed at small and mediumsized firms provides a useful index of industry-level marginal performance of small firms.
While we consider several limitations to this measure (and potential remedies) below, the
relationship between the performance of subsidized projects ( vˆi ) and industry-level private
financing ( Fˆi ) provides a concrete empirical approach to determining the relative salience of
capital constraints and appropriability in explaining the variance of small-firm venture financing
across industries.

Limitations and Potential Remedies
Without further amendment or caveats, it would seem that the proposed procedure
provides a consistent test for the hypotheses in Proposition 1 only under relatively stringent
conditions: variance in technological opportunity is either absent or controlled for, the

15

government-subsidized projects are at the margin of industry performance, and there is no direct
impact of the government subsidy on project performance itself. While relaxing each of these
assumptions requires a somewhat more nuanced interpretation of our results, we can address
each concern so that, while we keep each of these factors in mind, we are able to implement the
test implied by Proposition 1.
First, as Proposition 1 highlights, a consistent hypothesis test for the presence of variance
in the level of capital constraints or appropriability is conditioned on a control for the level of
technological opportunity. Indeed, traditional evaluations of the sources of R&D funding are
often unable to disentangle the salience of market imperfections from the overall level of
technological opportunity.9

However, we employ two separate mechanisms to provide a

consistent control for the level of technological opportunity for each of the subsidized projects in
our sample. As discussed earlier, our analysis focuses on the relationship between the level of
private venture financing aimed at small firms and the performance of subsidized projects aimed
at small businesses. As such, we are able to include R&D expenditures by large firms in
industry i as a control for the level of overall technological opportunity in industry i. For
example, in the pharmaceutical industry, the level of funding by established pharmaceutical
firms provides a useful measure of perceived technological opportunity ( Vi ) in that industry
relative to the impact of market imperfections (γ i ,θ i ) specific to (smaller) biotechnology firms.10
As well, we employ a direct measure of technological opportunity – a measure of the public
9

This inability to disentangle these factors is made difficult for two distinct reasons. First, most prior analyses focus
on the funding and performance of projects which are themselves funded by the private sector and so each project, at
least in expectation, has sufficiently overcome the presence of market imperfections to take advantage of market
opportunity (see, for example, Griliches and Cockburn, 1988; Hall and van Reenen, 2000). Second, because prior
analyses examine all firms within an industry, there is no “reference” group for which market imperfections should
be less salient but for which the level of technological opportunity should be similar to the focus group.
10
Of course, in a specific microeconomic environment, smaller and larger firms may have differential incentives to
respond to a given technological opportunity (perhaps because of incumbency, scale economies, or the like).

16

“stock” of scientific and technological knowledge associated with each project in the sample (in
the tradition of Rosenberg (1974) and Adams (1990)). Between these two measures, our analysis
provides a set of (reasonably) consistent controls for technological opportunity.
Second, our proposed implementation to test Proposition 1 is based on the assumption
that subsidized projects are “marginal” – those projects in a given industrial segment just below
the threshold of private funding. Of course, the subsidy program could use other selection
criteria for allocating funds. For example, if projects are selected to ensure the political success
of the program, then the subsidized projects may be “cherry-picked” – the best possible projects
available to program administrators rather than the set which are socially but not privately
worthwhile.11 On the one hand, the possibility of cherry-picking qualifies our interpretation of
the results. Specifically, under a cherry-picking selection mechanism, the specification continues
to provide a consistent test for the existence of variation in the level of appropriability across
sectors but becomes a less powerful test for identifying the impact of variance in capital
constraints. While a marginal project selection mechanism “balances” the impact of variation in
appropriability with the impact of variation in capital constraints, a regime that selects only the
“best” projects provides the most powerful test about appropriability at the expense of being able
to identify the impact of capital constraints at all.

On the other hand, even if project

administrators are attempting to cherry-pick projects, they may be greatly limited in that strategy
if subsidized funding is a less preferred source of capital than private venture financing. For
example, whereas the usual delay between application and grant of a subsidy is several months,
venture financiers can immediately fund projects that they deem worthwhile. As well, VCs
However, at an industry level, there is likely a positive correlation between the overall incentives of these two
classes of firms, and so we abstract away from these nuanced effects in the present analysis.

17

provide additional services beyond financial capital, including access to a network of contacts
and expertise in managing research-oriented start-up organizations (Stuart, Hong & Hybels,
1999; Hsu, 2000). Indeed, most of the respondents in our sample of SBIR firms reported
(qualitatively) that they would have preferred to attract venture finance to their projects if it had
been available to them. As such, we interpret our results both (a) keeping in mind that the
possibility of cherry-picking accentuates the impact of variance in appropriability in terms of the
estimated parameter and (b) that it is likely that SBIR-funded projects may in fact tend to be
relatively marginal projects, at least at the time of the application to the SBIR program, due to
funding preference of private entrepreneurs.
Third, even if the government is selecting projects that are marginal from the perspective
of the private sector, the program itself may have a direct impact on the performance of the
subsidized projects that impact the salience of the test. Indeed, by construction, the SBIR
alleviates the capital constraints facing funded firms. In contrast to the tradeoff that emerges
between the provision of incentives and the taking of equity in the analysis of private investment,
the SBIR extract neither equity nor debt from the grantee. In fact, quite the opposite. The
incentives to perform the research are preserved and incentives to divert the fruits of research
away from equity holders are minimized. However, as a hands-off subsidy, SBIR grants cannot
alleviate product market imperfections or the lack of technological opportunity in a given field.
If intellectual property rights are weak in a given area, SBIR funding cannot overcome this
general bias.12 Thus, similar to the project selection mechanism, the SBIR program itself likely
reduces the power of the test for identifying the impact of variance in capital constraints (as
11

Indeed, Wallsten provides evidence that SBIR administrators in fact do attempt to choose the “best” projects and
interprets his evidence to suggest that the SBIR funds many projects which would have received private funding
anyway (Wallsten, 2000).

18

subsidization overcomes some of these constraints) and increase the power of the test for
variance in the level of appropriability (since the SBIR does not affect sector-level differences
along this dimension).
Finally, while novel and informative, the proposed test should be interpreted
conservatively. Even under the best of circumstances, the procedure can only reject a hypothesis
of no variance in the level of appropriability (or capital constraints); rejecting this zero-variance
hypothesis along one dimension (e.g., appropriability) does not preclude the presence of variance
along the other dimension. Indeed, Proposition 2 suggests that, under the simplest functional
form and marginal funding, the estimated parameter will be equal to the difference in the
variances and so we interpret our results so that evidence in favor of one source of variance by
no means rejects variance along the other dimension. Moreover, while the model allows for a
balanced test between the variance associated with capital constraints and appropriability, it is
likely that the test will be more powerful for finding evidence for differences in appropriability;
the project selection mechanism and the incentive effects of the program mitigate against finding
direct evidence for capital constraints.

III.

The SBIR Program and R&D Investment by Small Firms
This paper uses Proposition 1 in order to evaluate how an evaluation of the performance

of government-subsidized small R&D-intensive firms helps us understand the concentration of
research funding across industries and technology segments. To do so, we exploit data about
projects funded by the Federal government’s SBIR, the largest individual source of R&D

12

Indeed, while VC funding may provide non-pecuniary value to the firm through managerial expertise or access to
a network of contacts, the SBIR focuses on funding technology development per se and contributes essentially no
additional commercialization services.

19

financing for small to medium-sized firms in the United States. SBIR funding provides a unique
and informative source of variation in the funding of small, research-oriented firms.

First

authorized as an NSF program in 1982, the SBIR program requires that all Federal agencies that
support a minimal level of R&D activity are required to set aside a certain percentage of their
funds for extramural grants to fund R&D projects by small business.13 The principal legislative
goals of the program are to:
(a) increase the commercialization rate of innovations resulting from Federal research,
(b) enhance the ‘competitiveness’ of small firms in technology-intensive industries; and
(c) enhance the participation of small firms as well as women and minority-owned
businesses in the Federal contracting process (GAO, 1995).
As described earlier, the economic impact of the program is to alleviate some of the
capital constraints facing funded firms while having no direct impact on the product market
environment. However, from a political perspective, the program’s support seems to derive in
part from (ever-increasing) political demand to focus R&D expenditures towards more near-term
development projects and to areas which have a clear relationship to medium-term economic
growth (Cohen and Noll, 1993). Combined with political rhetoric that simply assumes that
research-oriented start-up firms are the engine of long-term economic growth, and that such
firms face a severe “funding gap” arising from the unwillingness of investors to shoulder the
risks of early-stage financing, the SBIR has been a popular program whose scope has been
consistently expanded since its inception (GAO, 1995). Indeed, during the 1990s, the SBIR was
the single largest source of early–stage R&D financing for small firms in the United States with
annual expenditures over $1 billion.

13

This percentage has varied over time (from 1.25 in the 1980s up to 2.5% as of 1997). As well, the SBIR defines a
small business as a US-owned firm with less than 500 employees. Further details of the SBIR are discussed
extensively in GAO (1995), Wallsten (1998), and Lerner (1997).

20

Despite its political support, the program has been somewhat controversial. In part, this is
because neither the legislative nor regulatory rules governing the program mandate the program
fund projects on the margin (which would determine performance according to the first part of
Proposition One).

As highlighted dramatically by Wallsten (2000), the program’s funding

guidelines seem to focus on funding the most attractive grant applications from either a technical
or commercialization perspective.14 Indeed, perhaps as a consequence of this selectivity, Lerner
finds that firms funded by the program do tend to have an accelerated rate of growth compared to
similar firms (Lerner, 1997). However, Lerner emphasizes that this “boost” to firm-level growth
seems to be localized according to the location or technology focus of the firm, a contention that
our framework implicitly revisits and explores in much greater detail.
More generally, we refocus analysis of the SBIR away from program assessment per se
and towards the exploitation of two structure of the SBIR to evaluate the sources of R&D
concentration. First, because the program is administered through a variety of Federal agencies
(Agriculture, Defense, HHS, etc.), whose missions span the scope of the economy’s activities,
the expenditures of the SBIR program are much more widely dispersed (across industries and
technological areas) than privately funded R&D. This wedge between SBIR expenditures and
private funding is particularly salient if one focuses on investment or R&D expenditures
specifically for small (or venture-backed) firms.

In other words, a specific if unintended

contribution of the SBIR program is to expand the supply of capital to research-oriented, smaller
firms to a set of industries and technologies which, for one reason or another, do not currently
attract high levels of such funds. As a result, the program is extremely useful for identifying
14

As a result, the main focus of prior research (GAO, 1995; Lerner, 1997; Wallsten, 1998; 2000) has been on the
assessment of the marginal contribution of SBIR funding (and government venture capital more generally) to the
performance of subsidized firms. Towards this goal, these analyses are framed in terms of the counterfactual of the
expected behavior or performance of these firms, in the absence of the subsidy program. Indeed, both Lerner (1997)

projects across a set of industrial segments that vary greatly in terms of their level of private
venture financing. Second, as discussed earlier, the use of a subsidy program (in contrast to
examining privately funded projects) allows, in principle, for the identification of projects in
each industrial segment which are socially but not privately worthwhile and so are on the margin
of the funding threshold. While it is possible that the program does potentially experience some
cherry-picking (which mitigates against this benefits), the fact that SBIR funding tends to be a
less “preferred” source of external capital suggests that we the use of subsidized projects are a
superior sample for performing our test (relative to prior work which examines projects which
are themselves funded by the private sector).

IV.

Data
This paper presents results from a novel dataset of 100 projects funded by the SBIR since

1990. The data were gathered via a field-based proprietary survey conducted by the authors. This
project-level data was then supplemented with public data on each firm’s patenting behavior,
SBIR grant history, and covariates related to the industry, business segment, and scientific
underpinning associated with each project. In this section, we first review our procedure and the
elements of our survey (highlighting the sample selection and data gathering process) and then
review the summary statistics for the sample (Table 1 includes the definitions of all the variables
used in the analysis; Table 2 provides means and standard deviations).

and Wallsten (1998; 2000) focus their results around the comparison of a group of SBIR-funded firms and a
“matched sample” of firms who are observationally similar ex ante but who do not receive SBIR funding.

22

Survey Data Sources and Sample Selection Method
The data is drawn from several sources; most importantly a survey conducted between
December and February 1999 (see Appendix B for a copy).15 The sample is drawn from a list
(compiled by the Small Business Administration) of the (approximately) 200 largest historical
beneficiaries of SBIR grants.16 For survey participants, we requested information about their
most successful project funded by the SBIR (for most firms, there was only one (or at most two)
SBIR-funded projects which the firm considered technologically successful). By focusing on
projects that overcame the substantial technological hurdles associated with innovation, the data
provide information about the relative economic returns of projects in different industries that are
at least successful in a technical sense.
At the firm level, we collected background information on the organization’s employees
and promotion policies; financial information about corporate ownership, expenditures and
revenues; and corporate governance. At the project level, each company was asked to provide
information on the commercialization and financing history of the technology project, including
revenues through sales and licensing of the technology, the importance of the technology in
achieving various goals of the firm, key personnel involved in setting the commercialization
strategy of the company, and information about the commercialization strategy itself.17

15

Along with a similar survey of the commercialization histories of venture-backed firms, the data from this survey
are being used to study a variety of phenomena associated with the incentives, strategies, and performance of
research-oriented start-ups and, in particular, on the impact of the Federal SBIR subsidy on each of these issues.
16
The overall response rate to the survey was approximately 50%. Firms contacted but not responding seemed to be
randomly mixed between firms not having a commercial product and those too busy or not willing to respond.
Within the organization, the respondent was typically one of the following individuals: the director of R&D, the
director of sales or marketing, or the CEO. Most of the surveys (approximately 75%) were filled out over the
telephone, with the balance either faxed or mailed back. All respondents were guaranteed that their individual
responses would be kept confidential.
17
Whenever possible, we used publicly available databases to verify information from the survey responders. For
example, we verified the number of patents assigned to each organization through both the US Patent and
Trademark Office’s web site and the IBM patent database.

23

From this survey, we construct both project-specific and firm-specific variables (see
Table 1 for definitions). First, we define the project-level variables. We define performance in
terms of the aggregate annual revenues from product sales, licensing, and intellectual property
exchanges (REVENUE 98).18 For each project, we identify the number of PATENTS awarded
since the grant as well as the project-level SBIR AWARD SIZE (from the USPTO and the Small
Business Administration, respectively). In addition, we identify all firms who receive at least
some of their overall revenues not through direct product market sales but through licensing
arrangements or intellectual property sales. We denote these firms COOPERATORS insofar as
nearly all of these firms are involved in cooperative contracting with more established product
market incumbents; it is useful to note that this cooperative behavior is in lieu of competition
with the same firms who have arranged to “buy out” the SBIR awardees’ product market
position (Anton and Yao, 1994; Gans and Stern, 2000; Gans, Hsu, and Stern, 2000). We also
include several dummy variables, which denote the technology, product and customer base types
of each project (UPGRADE, MADE-TO-ORDER, NOVEL SYSTEM, and LARGE
CUSTOMER BASE).

Finally, we calculate one measure of overall product development

efficiency (TIME-TO-MARKET) that is simply the overall time from initial product conception
to the first sale of this product to any customer (either directly or through licensing).
As well, we include several firm-specific variables that describe the more general
financial and organizational structure of the firm. In terms of the measurement of performance, a
portion of our analysis is organized around the determinants of current firm size
(EMPLOYMENT 98). We use the initial value of this measure as a key control in most of our
empirical analysis (BASELINE EMPLOYEES), in order to control for the initial size of the firm.

18

All of the qualitative results are robust to using the data on total project revenues (indeed, they are highly
correlated). However, this would further reduce the number of usable surveys by approximately one-third.

24

As well, the analysis examines variables related to financial structure, VC EQUITY SHARE and
INSIDER EQUITY SHARE. The difference between these is while the first confirms the
potential importance of the “certification” hypothesis (SBIR grants lead to VC funding which
leads to overall performance), the latter allows us to capture the pure associated between
performance and maintaining a closely held organization. Similarly, FOUNDER CEO proxies
for the overall entrepreneurial culture and authority structure of the firm.

Sources and Definitions of Industry and Segment-Level Variables
A critical element of the analysis is the relationship of project-level performance to
measures of private and public investments in the industries, technology segments or scientific
areas associated with each project. Specifically, we want to distinguish three concepts: overall
investment in businesses or R&D by small firms, aggregate private R&D in the project’s
industrial area, and the scientific and engineering opportunities present in the technological areas
inherent in the project.
To capture the first, we assigned each project to one of eleven technology segments
identified by Venture One (see Figure 3A). For each segment, we measure the VC FUNDING
STOCK as the (undiscounted) sum of venture investing in that segment between 1985 – 1992.
We also present results for the VC CAPITAL FLOW, which are composed exclusively of the
1992 disbursements. We also assign each project (firm) to a single three-digit SIC; the NSF
Science and Engineering Indicators provides data for each SIC on SIC-LEVEL R&D
EXPENDITURES, SIC SALES, and SIC-LEVEL SMALL FIRM R&D EXPENDITURES.
Finally, we measure the project’s association with scientific or engineering opportunity by
constructing a SCIENCE STOCK for each project. First, we assigned each project to one or

25

more scientific and engineering fields (out of a total of 14). In contrast to the mutually exclusive
nature of the prior variables, the science base of each project can be composed from multiple
sources. For each area (e.g., physics or chemical engineering), we computed the (discounted)
Federal Funding stock in that area (equal to 1990 FUNDING + .8 1988 FUNDING + .6 1986
FUNDING). Each project’s SCIENCE STOCK is simply the sum of the individual field-level
stocks for fields associated with that project.
In addition, we attempt to provide additional controls for the environmental heterogeneity
among firms by including a number of variables from the survey that attempt to capture the
firm’s perception of the appropriability environment relevant for their specific project.
Specifically, we include several variables that relate to the relative importance of differences
source of intellectual property (PATENTS, SECRECY, SPEED TO MARKET), each of which is
measured as a 5-point Likert scale variable. As well, we include several (five-point Likert scale)
variables measuring the importance associated with the control of different complementary
assets (MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTION, BRANDING, SERVICING).

Summary Statistics
Out of a total 100 responses, 74 were fully usable for the empirical work reported here.19
However, for most of the analysis, we exclude the small number of observations (3) that were
clearly so-called SBIR “mills”; these organizations have a much more diverse research portfolio
from the rest of the sample and also have a different relationship with funding agencies. This
leaves us with 71 total observations for the majority of our analysis.

19

Most of the non-responses were because of non-reporting of all 1998 revenues (e.g., sales reported but not
licensing revenue). We have checked our results including all results, even those for whom the data was incomplete;
the qualitative results are unchanged.

26

Among these 71, the average project reports approximately 6.5 million dollars in
revenue, compared with an average award size of 1.5 million (but note the high standard
deviations associated with each). As well, these organizations seem to be highly productive in a
technical sense. On average, each has been issued over 9 patents that were applied for since the
first SBIR grant associated with the specific project here (all chosen projects have their first
funding date after 1990). In addition, almost a third of the sample earns at least some its revenue
through cooperative licensing or IP exchanges (most often with product market incumbents). As
well, the average commercialization length of projects is a little over four years, though some
outliers in part drive this (from biotechnology and the like). Finally, at the firm level, while most
of these organizations are quite small at inception (35 employees on average), they tend to
experience substantial growth over time (the average firm has nearly 90 employees by 1998).20
As suggested earlier, the principal empirical exercise of this paper will be to relate
project-level performance measures (REVENUE 98 and EMPLOYMENT 98) to segment-level
measures of private investment activity and the technological environment. Figure 3 presents the
distributions of the three principal measures we use to capture these effects: 1992 VC FUNDING
STOCK, SCIENCE STOCK, and SIC-LEVEL R&D EXPENDITURES. Each of these measures
provides a distinct way of capturing the degree of environmental heterogeneity facing different
SBIR-funded projects in terms of the level of technological opportunity and realized private
investment activity. Whereas the VC FUNDING STOCK (Figure 3A) measures the skewed
distribution of entrepreneurial activity and is divided into several segments which do not
precisely map into the traditional SIC classification, Figure 3B and 3C measure differences in

20

As well, in terms of the internal organization and finance of the firms, over 50% of equity is retained by insiders;
perhaps surprisingly, while 25% of the sample had attracted some form of VC or “angel” financing, the equity share
of these investors is quite small (the average level of equity held by these outside investors across the full sample is
less than 7%). In addition, in nearly 60% of the firms, the CEO is one of the original founders of the firm.

27

investment in alternative scientific and engineering fields upon which many of these innovations
draw and differences across sectors in terms of aggregate R&D expenditures, respectively.
Whereas SCIENCE STOCK and R&D EXPENDITURES will tend to be sensitive to differences
across sectors in terms of technological opportunity, only VC FUNDING STOCK will be
sensitive to the differences across sectors in terms of the degree of appropriability or the salience
of capital market constraints facing small research-oriented firms. Consistent with the SIC-level
motivating statistics we presented in Table II, Figure 3 highlights both the skewed nature of both
venture financing and R&D funding (e.g., telecommunications, medical care technologies, and
software make up over 60% of the aggregate 1992 VC FUNDING STOCK).
In terms of their overall summary statistics, while the VC FUNDING STOCK is
measured as the cumulative investment in given areas over 8 years, one can see that the
aggregate average level of SCIENCE STOCK and R&D EXPENDITURES are considerably
higher, particularly given that SCIENCE STOCK depends on the summation across three years
of investment and R&D EXPENDITURES is measured from a single cross-section. As well, the
Appropriability Mechanism measures (control variables for the environment) are each Likert
measures; not surprisingly, the mean of each varies from a little above 3 to just over 4.

V.

Empirical Results
We now turn to our evaluation of the principal hypotheses of this paper (recall

Proposition 1). Specifically, we are concerned with the degree of variation across sectors in
technological opportunity (Var(V )), the degree of appropriability (Var(γ)), and the relative
salience of capital constraints (Var(θ)). Our empirical test provides evidence about the relative
salience of these factors in explaining the large differences in R&D funding for small firms

28

across industries that we highlighted in Section II. Specifically, we test for the relationship
between project-level performance and the level of private investment in each project’s industry
or technological segment, controlling for project-specific or firm-specific factors that also may
affect performance. In Tables 3-5 and Figure 4, we present our main finding from this analysis:
controlling for project-level, firm-level and other environmental characteristics, revenue is
increasing in the level of venture capital funding for small firms in a given technology segment
and, more tentatively, in the science stock associated with a given technology. In contrast,
performance is not statistically related to overall R&D investment in a given area or the overall
size of an industrial segment. These basic findings are robust to several quite stringent tests of
robustness, including the inclusion of additional controls for appropriability, project-level and
firm-level factors, as well as variation in the measurement of the level of financing for small
research-oriented firms (some of these results are presented in Appendix C). As well, in Table 6,
we show that there is also a positive relationship between an alternative measure of performance
(EMPLOYMENT 98) and the industry-specific level of venture financing.

The Performance of SBIR-funded Development Projects
We begin in Tables 3 with the relationship between L REVENUE 98 and each of the
alternative measures of private investment and technological opportunity. The most striking
result is that, whereas SCIENCE STOCK, SIC R&D EXPENDITURES, and SIC SIZE are
uncorrelated with project-level performance, 1992 VC FUNDING STOCK is both statistically
significant and quantitatively important: doubling the level of venture funding in an industrial
segment is associated with over a 50% increase in measured revenue (see (3-1)). As well, in (35), we demonstrate that our principal result concerning the VC FUNDING STOCK is robust to

29

the inclusion of the alternative measures of the segment-level environment (which remain
themselves insignificant and lower in magnitude). When considering these results, it is useful to
recall that the inclusion of SCIENCE STOCK and SIC R&D EXPENDITURES allow us to
distinguish between measures of overall technological opportunity and variation in the level of
appropriability or capital constraints impacting small, entrepreneurial firms.
Figure 4 dramatically illustrates this finding. While average project revenue is closely
associated with the level of venture financing by segment (indeed, the lowest four segments have
average performance levels strictly below the upper four segments), the performance of the SBIR
projects seems, at best, to be negatively associated with aggregate R&D expenditures (which is
driven primarily by expenditures by larger firms in each industry. In other words, under the
logic of Proposition 1, these results suggests the presence of differences across industrial
segments in terms of their appropriability environment (i.e., Var(γ) > 0), even after incorporating
two direct measures capturing variation in technological opportunity across segments.
While the sample size is limited, these results provide strong evidence in terms of the
presence of variation in appropriability. However, it is important to recall that the results do not
reject variation in capital constraints; instead, the impact of variation from appropriability
outweighs the impact of variation from capital constraints in these data. Given some of our
earlier concerns about the details of the project selection mechanism (i.e., the possibility of
cherry-picking) and the impact of subsidized funding on project performance (which will tend to
ameliorate the impact of capital constraints), it is perhaps not surprising that our main empirical
findings are in support of variation in the level of appropriability. By itself, this is an important
finding: we are not aware of prior quantitative evidence demonstrating that the sources of

30

concentration in venture financing is driven by segment-level differences in the level of
appropriability.
Of course, it is possible that these results are in fact being driven by more “project-level”
factors that outweigh the impact of the segment-level variation. Table 4 therefore extends the
analysis of the determinants of REVENUE 98 by focusing on the robustness of the VC
FUNDING STOCK result to the inclusion of various project-level, firm-level, or alternative
environmental controls. In (4-1), we include the simplest “control,” the level of initial
employment at each firm. In some sense, this very simple measure should capture some degree
of the heterogeneity among firms in terms of their initial conditions in terms of generating
products associated with a given level of revenue; however, its inclusion does not impact our
main result at all. We then extend our analysis is (4-2) and (4-3) by including a number of
alternative control variables, associated with the firm’s perception of the appropriability
environment and project-level controls, respectively. At one level, the results from this analysis
are interesting in their own right: while revenues are increasing in the technological quality and
product development efficiency of the project (PATENTS, UPGRADE and TIME TO MARKET
respectively) and whether firms “cooperate” with more established firms (note this could be in
part the result of the selectivity of projects which are attractive for licensing), revenues are
relatively unrelated to the Likert measures of the appropriability environment facing individual
firms. However, the more important finding from Table 4 is that the coefficient associated with
VC FUNDING STOCK remains roughly the same magnitude and statistically significant, despite
the large number of control variables included and given the relatively small number of
observations in the sample. Indeed, in (4-4), we include all of the control measures
simultaneously with no impact on the underlying result regarding the VC FUNDING STOCK

31

variable. Once again, given the logic of Proposition 1 (and the associated caveats about the
relatively small sample size and the imperfect controls for project selection), these results
suggest variation across sectors in terms of the degree of appropriability facing small firms, and
that such differences are reflected in the ability of subsidized firms to earn returns on their
innovations in specific industrial segments.
In Table 5, we turn back to the more general comparison between the VC FUNDING
STOCK variable and measures which more closely correspond to technological opportunity
(SCIENCE STOCK and SIC R&D EXPENDITURES). Specifically, in (5-1) and (5-2), we
regress REVENUE 98 on each of the alternative measures (SCIENCE STOCK and SIC R&D
EXPENDITURES, respectively), including all of the controls considered in Table 4.
Interestingly, with these controls in place, the magnitude of the coefficient associated with
SCIENCE STOCK increases substantially and is statistically significant (SIC R&D
EXPENDITURES remains both relatively small and statistically insignificant). However, when,
in (5-3), we include all of these variables together, the principal result associated with VC
FUNDING STOCK remains robust, as does the SCIENCE STOCK result. In other words, even
after we control simultaneously for various project-level controls as well as measures associated
with technological opportunity and aggregate R&D expenditures, the highest performing SBIRfunded projects tend to be associated with those industrial segments with high rates of venture
capital funding.21 While such a result may be interesting in terms of SBIR evaluation per se,
perhaps we highlight the economic implication of this finding: such covariation exists when
21

Appendix C (Tables C-1 and C-2) further establish the robustness of the VC FUNDING result. In C-1, we include
additional firm-level covariates, including measures of the financial organization of the firm, as well as additional
environmental covariates associated with the geographic location of the firm. As before, while the SCIENCE
STOCK variable is only significant in some specifications, the VC FUNDING STOCK remains significant at a
similar magnitude. Finally, in C-2, we consider alternative sample selection schemes such as mandating that we only
include projects whose 98 REVENUES are greater than the size of their SBIR grant or including the SBIR “mills” in
the analysis. As before, our main qualitative results are unchanged.

32

differences across sectors are the result of differences in the level of appropriability facing small,
entrepreneurially oriented firms.
Finally, in Table 6, we compare our results regarding REVENUE 98 to an alternative
analysis focused on the determinants of firm-level employment (EMPLOYMENT 98). In some
sense, this analysis is more directly comparable to the analysis pursued by Lerner (1997), in that
Table 6 focuses on the determinants of firm-level performance among SBIR-funded firms. The
analysis is straightforward and echoes our earlier finding: while employment growth seems to be
relatively unrelated to environmental measures associated with SCIENCE STOCK or SIC R&D
EXPENDITURES, there is a quantitatively important and statistically significant relationship
between EMPLOYMENT 98 and VC FUNDING STOCK, even after controlling for BASELINE
EMPLOYMENT (as well, this result is relatively robust to the inclusion of various controls,
similar to the earlier analysis). In conjunction with our earlier findings regarding REVENUE 98,
Table 6 provides additional evidence that there is a robust positive relationship between the
performance of SBIR-funded projects and segment-specific levels of venture activity, consistent
with the presence of differences across sectors in the appropriability environment facing small
research-oriented firms.

VI.

Conclusions
The main conclusions of this study are the result of its core quantitative finding: SBIR

project performance is highest for those projects in industrial segments which themselves receive
the highest level of venture financing. Such a finding should be of some direct interest to
policymakers: if program administrators are given strong incentives to identify projects with the
highest performance, then there may be pressures to focus SBIR funding precisely on those

33

segments for which venture financing is readily available. Or, from another perspective, the fact
that the SBIR program is run through a variety of different agencies may have the (unintended
but) beneficial effect of increasing the availability of funding to precisely those segments of the
economy where small-firm research faces the highest hurdles, either in terms of appropriability
or capital constraints.
More generally, however, this finding allows us to begin to disentangle the relative
salience of alternative sources of the concentration of venture financing. While we view our
results as suggestive rather than definitive, to our knowledge, this is the first evidence for the
importance of variation in appropriability in helping to understand the concentration of R&D
among a small number of industrial segments. Specifically, whereas most prior analyses have
had difficulty distinguishing between the response to overall technological opportunity and the
level of appropriability, our focus on specific technologies being commercialized by smaller
firms subsidized by the U.S. government provides extremely useful controls: patterns of
aggregate spending by larger firms and the stock of scientific knowledge used by individual
projects. More generally, our results suggest that rather than simply being the result of “herding”
by venture capitalists in response to diffuse priors about technological opportunity, our evidence
suggests that the economy seems to offer small “pockets” where the appropriability regime (and
the level of technological opportunity) facing small, research-oriented start-ups is particularly
favorable. Indeed, understanding how such pockets emerge is a promising area for further study.
As well, the specific interpretation of our results can be tied more specifically to policy.
Whereas the SBIR is focused on overcoming the “funding gap” for small, research-oriented
firms, our results suggest that there may be some benefits from also addressing the strength of
the appropriability regime facing small firms. At least in part, the low level in funding for small

34

firm research in some areas may be the result of specific (and potentially remediable)
weaknesses in the appropriability regime facing small firms, such as the availability of
intellectual property or antitrust rules which limit the ability of smaller firms to access the
complementary assets required for commercialization in a competitive market.
As we have emphasized several times, our results are provocative but not the final word.
Even beyond issues such as the sample size, our approach only allows us to estimate a “reducedform” parameter and so our evidence in favor of variance in appropriability comes at the expense
of simultaneously identifying the salience of capital constraints. As well, while our results
concerning appropriability are consistent even if the project selection mechanism satisfies a
“cherry-picking” regime and there are direct impacts of the program on project performance,
distinguishing among the separate effects of each of these factors seems important. Perhaps a
careful integration of the program evaluation methodologies of Wallsten and Lerner with the
within-program evaluation pursued here will allow for more nuanced examination of both the
role played by market imperfections in shaping the level and productivity of small firm
innovation and the role played by government policy in alleviating these market imperfections.

Appendix A: Sources of Capital Market Imperfections
In Section III, we considered the effect of a capital subsidy. We argued that a capital
subsidy effectively eliminates problems caused by capital market imperfections or at least
equalizes them for grant recipients across industries. Suppose, as we will do through this
appendix, that c( F , θ ) = F + θ . We consider in more detail the reasons why θ > 0 by looking at
three alternative models based on moral hazard, adverse selection and expropriation. In each the
capital market imperfection will arise when a particular parameter, φ, is positive. We will
demonstrate that θ = 0 whenever the parameter φ is zero. Finally, in what follows, we omit the
industry subscript, i, from notation.

(a) Moral Hazard
Suppose that the RU employs effort in innovative activity and that this can influence the
likelihood of generating a successful innovation. We assume that this effort has a contractible
and a non-contractible component. Using only contractible effort, the probability of generating a
successful innovation is pL. We normalize the cost of this effort to 0. However, by expending
non-contractible effort for a marginal cost of 1, the RU can raise this innovation probability to pH
> pL.
We make two simplifying assumptions. First, we assume that research and capital
provision to the RU is socially desirable for some projects, i.e., pH V > F + 1 . Second, we assume
that there exists F beyond which it is never worthwhile providing capital to the RU if it is not
expected to expend a high level of effort in innovative activity, i.e., pLv (V , γ ) = F . The former
assumption raises the possibility that some socially desirable projects may go unfunded because
of a lack of appropriability. The latter assumption, however, means that the VC may not fund
some privately profitable projects. This is essentially because of a capital market imperfection
that dilutes the role of VC-equity when RU effort is non-contractible.
Turning to the determinants of VC funding let α denote the level of equity the RU retains
in its own firm. This level of equity (and any capital forthcoming from the VC) is determined
prior to the RU engaging in any innovative activity. The minimum level of equity the RU can
have and still expend a high level of effort ex post is given by the α that just satisfies the RU’s
incentive constraint:
pH α v − 1 ≥ p L v ⇒ α ≥

1
.
v ( pH − p L )

Given the competitive nature of VC capital markets, VC capital will be forthcoming for the
project so long as it is still profitable at this minimum RU-equity level.
pH (1 − α )v ≥ F

49

Substituting for α, we can re-write the participation constraint for the VC as:
pH v − 1 ≥ F + φ ,
where φ = pL /( pH − pL ) . Notice that, in this model, θ = φ ; meaning that the private cost of
capital exceeds the social cost of capital whenever, φ > 0.

(b) Adverse Selection
In the previous model, the capital market imperfection arose because of the detrimental
effect of VC equity on the incentives of the RU to expend non-contractible effort in innovative
activity. Here we consider an alternative model where the probability of a successful innovation
depends on the RU’s ‘type’ that is private information to the RU. We suppose that there are two
types of RU’s. RU’s with high ability generate a successful innovation with probability pH while
for those with lower ability this probability is reduced to pL. There is no non-contractible RU
effort. It is assumed that a given RU is a high type with probability 1-φ and this is commonly
known. The potential value of the project, v, is, however, known. Finally, we maintain the
assumption of the previous sub-section that pH V > F and pLv (V , γ ) < F .
Recall that the VC market is competitive, so RUs can demand the maximum level of
equity for a given project, v. However, as they cannot signal their type, the maximum RU equity
that either the high or low type can demand is:

( (1 − φ ) pH + φ pL ) (1 − α )v = F
⇒ α = 1−

F
( (1 − φ ) pH + φ pL ) v

This means that the lowest value project that can be funded in an industry is determined by the v
that results in α = 0; i.e., v = (1−φ ) pFH +φ pL . Notice that this is increasing in φ implying that the
inability of VCs to distinguish good RUs from bad results in a high threshold for funding and,
consequently, a lower level of VC funding in the industry. Thus, for this model, θ = (1φ−φ( p) HpH+ +pφL )pL .
This equals 0 if φ = 0.

(c) Expropriation
Our final model of capital market perfections is based on the potential for expropriation
of ideas by a VC. When an RU approaches a given VC for funding they must reveal their
potential idea. In some situations, an RU will provide inputs that are required for that idea to
become commercially viable. In other situations, however, the RU does not add any value in this
sense. If property rights over the idea are weak (as they may be prior to any patents or
copyright), then a VC may expropriate the idea and refuse to let the RU share in any returns.

50

This is a fundamental difficulty in any trade in ideas (Arrow, 1962; and Anton and Yao, 1994)
and it constrains RU appropriability in at every stage of innovation.
We suppose that, provided a unit of capital is expended, the idea becomes
commercializable with probability, p, and the potential return, v, is common knowledge.
However, it is possible that the VC simply expropriate the full private return v if approached by
the RU. Anticipating this, the RU may not develop the idea of approach the RU (although here
there is no incentive for the RU not to bring the idea to a VC22). Nonetheless, a capital
constrained RU may have some alternative means of raising capital. This is certainly the case
here given our assumption of a competitive VC market. If one VC were to expropriate the idea,
the idea may be financed by another VC.
To see this, recall that product market appropriation (γ) depends in part on the degree of
competition an innovation faces. That is, are there products that are close substitutes? If the RU
were to turn to another VC, it may be able to reduce product market appropriation to (1 − φ )γ ;
even though it would not receive any ex post rents itself in this eventuality. Fearing the RU’s
competitive threat from disclosure to others, the initial VC may not expropriate the RU; instead
giving the RU some equity in the venture.
This means that RU-equity will be determined through a bilateral negotiation between
themselves and the first VC they approach. This equity is, therefore, not determined
competitively but through a bilateral monopoly. Essentially, both the RU and VC can use the
threat of disclosure to others or expropriation to bind themselves to reach agreement.
Following disclosure of the idea to the VC, the two parties negotiate over the equity level
given to the RU. Assuming Nash bargaining with equal bargaining power this yields:
p(1 − α )v − F − ( p(1 − φ )v − F ) = pα v
⇒ α = 12 φ
A project with social value, V, will be funded if and only if the VC’s participation constraints
(expecting this level of equity) are satisfied. This participation constraint is pv ≥ 2 −2φ F .
Consequently, the private cost of capital for this model is given by θ =
exceeds 0 for φ ∈ (0, 2] .

22

φ
2 −φ

F and it clearly

One could imagine that the RU has some sunk expenditures prior to bringing an idea to a VC that would be lost in
the face of expropriation. This could be added to the model here but it would not alter the basic insight below about
the high private cost of capital; it would merely complicated the cost of capital function.

You mentioned before that the project’s first prototype was developed around 19__. From that time onwards, your
success with this technology likely depended, at least in part, on your control of resources which were not directly
linked to the technology itself and on your ability to protect the innovation from imitation by others through
intellectual property protection. Let’s first consider how important your firm’s control over resources has been in
earning profits from this innovation. For each factor below, rate the importance over access and control of this
resource on a scale from 1 to 5. A rating of “5” would mean that control over this resource was critical for earning
profits from this innovation while a “1” would imply that control over this resource was not important at all.

The capability to manufacture the product
