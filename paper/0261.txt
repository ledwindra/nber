SURVEY EVIDENCE ON THE 'RATIONALITY' OF
INTEREST RATE EXPECTATIONS
Benjamin M. FRIEDMAN*
Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA

An analysis of predictions of six interest rates over 3-months-ahead and 6-months-ahead
horizons, surveyed regularly over eight years, casts doubt on the hypothesis that market
participants' expectations are 'rational' in Muth's sense. Tests show that the survey respondents
did not make unbiased predictions, that (especially for the 6-months-ahead predictions) they did
not efficiently exploit the information contained in past interest rate movements, that their
respective 3-months-ahead and 6-months-ahead predictions failed to be consistent in the sense

required for 'rationality', and that (for long-term but not short-term interest rates) their
predictions failed to exploit efficiently the information contained in common macroeconomic
and macro-policy variables other than the money stock.

1. Introduction
Survey data on expectations can serve two useful purposes in the empirical

testing of economic hypotheses. Using survey data to proxy otherwise
unobservable expectations, treated as independent variables in economic
relationships, facilitates investigating the influence of expectations on
economic behavior; and using survey data to proxy expectations treated as

dependent variables facilitates investigating the expectations formation
process itself. For example, an extensive literature has exploited survey data
to analyze the influence and formation of various kinds of expectations and
anticipations relating to spending behavior. Much of this work for the business

sector has relied on the McGraw-Hill and Commerce/SEC investment
surveys, while analogous work for the household sector has used the
Michigan and Conference Board consumer surveys. More recently, as price
expectations have become a topic of especially great concern, researchers
have used the Livingston consumer price index expectations survey as an
independent variable in a variety of time-series relationships,' and Turnovsky
(1972), Pesando (1975), Carlson (1977) and Mullineaux (1978) have analyzed

B.M. Friedman, Survey evidence on the 'rationality' of interest rate expectations

the formation of the expectations surveyed by Livingston. In addition, Kane
and Malkiel (1976) have studied the properties of price expectations using
cross-section data from surveys taken in several specific years.
By contrast, despite the central role of expectations in the theory of asset
markets in general and interest rates in particular, the absence of systematic
surveys has largely precluded the use of survey data to proxy interest rate

expectations Apart from an earlier analysis by Kane and Malkiel (1967),
again using cross-section data, most research on interest rate expectations
has instead inferred the crucial unobservable expectations by exploiting
simultaneous observations of the yields on (i.e., the prices of) two or more
assets, in conjunction with a theory of the determination of relative yields
(i.e., relative asset prices). The majority of such studies have used the theory
of the term structure of interest rates, due to Hicks (1939) and Lutz (1940),
to infer expectations by comparing the yields on otherwise comparable debt
securities with different maturities. Alternatively, Bodie and Friedman (1978)
used a variant of Pye's (1966) theory of the value of the call option to infer

expectations by comparing the yields on otherwise comparable debt
securities with different call provisions. Under both approaches the validity
of the inference about interest rate expectations is, of course, conditional on
the underlying asset pricing hypothesis.
There does exist, however, one ongoing systematic survey of interest rate
expectations, and the object of this paper is to use time-series data from this
survey to test a number of specific hypotheses about expectations formation.
Hence the analysis of interest rate expectations in this paper corresponds to

the work on price expectations by Turnovsky and others, in that it treats
expectations as dependent variables and focuses on how expectations are
formed (rather than on the effect of expectations on observable behavior).
Using the survey data on interest rate expectations obviates the need to infer

expectations in a manner that is conditional on some asset pricing
hypothesis, but of course even survey data cannot eliminate the
fundamentally conditional nature of any conclusions to be drawn about the
expectations formation process. Here such conclusions are conditional simply
on the survey data's measuring accurately the expectations actually held by
market participants.

Recent developments in the macroeconomics literature, due to Lucas
(1972, 1976), Sargent and Wallace (1975), Barro (1976) and others, have
shown that strong implications for economic behavior (e.g., neutrality of

money) and economic policy (e.g., the impossibility of a systematic
stabilization policy) follow from the assumption that expectations are
'rational' in the sense made explicit by Muth (1961). To date much of the
criticism of these models has followed the line of showing that additional
features like wage rigidity negate the neutrality results,2 and has taken as
2See, for example, Fischer (1977) and Phelps and Taylor (1977).

the assumption that expectations are 'rational'. A few' writers have
questioned the 'rationality' assumption as overly strong, but have done so
largely at the conceptual level.3 What is understandably scarce, in light of
the paucity of direct observations on expectations, is empirical evidence on
whether expectations are indeed 'rational' in the required way. Especially
since Poole (1976) and others have argued that the markets for actively
given

traded financial assets are the most plausible arena in which to find
expectations which are 'rational' in Muth's sense, it is instructive to exploit

the time-series data from the survey to test the reported interest rate
expectations for properties directly implied by 'rationality': unbiasedness,
efficiency, consistency, and orthogonality of errors to costlessly available
information.

Section 2 briefly describes the data and the nature of the underlying
survey. Sections 3—6 present the results of testing hypotheses about the
formation of interest rate expectations. Section 7 briefly summarizes the
findings of these tests and discusses their implications.

2. The survey data4
The Goidsinith-—Nagan Bond and j\ionev Market Letter is a bi—weekly

publication widely circulated among professional financial market
participants, including investors, traders and underwriters. Since September,
1969, the Goldsmith—Nagan Letter has conducted a quarterly survey of the
interest rate expectations of a selected panel of approximately fifty of its
subscribers who are known to the publisher to be market professionals. The
panel members typically represent a variety of different kinds of financial
institutions. In one issue per quarter the Goldsmith—Nagan Letter reports to

its subscribers the results of the survey, in the form of the means of the
individual responses,5 together with the names of the participating panel
members (whose individual responses remain confidential).
The Goldsmith—Nagan survey, conducted late in the final month of each

calendar quarter, asks respondents to indicate their respective point
expectations for each of a set of interest rates as of the close of the last
business day of the coming quarter and of the quarter following. Hence the
data consist of pairs of simultaneously held one-quarter-ahead and twoquarter-ahead predictions.
The Goldsmith—Nagan survey includes eleven interest rates, but some —
for example, the commercial bank prime lending rate and the Federal
3See, for example. Simon (1978. 1979) and Friedman (1979).

4Since a more detailed description of the data and the underlying survey is available in Prell
(1973), this section provides only a brief description in preface to the empirical tests.
5Baker (1977) has usefully shown that, if individuals form rational predictions on the basis of

shared information, then the means of the individual predictions will also exhibit rationality.
Hence it is valid to test the rationality of the underlying individual predictions by working with
the survey means reported in the Goldsmith—Nagan publication.

expectations raises troublesome issues. The analysis in this paper therefore
fOcuses on those six interest rates, included in the survey, which are yields on
assets actively traded in the financial markets: (1) federal funds, (2) threemonth U.S. Treasury bills. (3) six-month Eurodollar certificates of deposit,
(4) twelve-month U.S. Treasury bills, (5) new issues of high-grade long-term
utility bonds, and (6) seasoned issues of high-grade long-term municipal
bonds. The sample period consists of thirty quarterly observations, beginning
with predictions made in September, 1969 (for December, 1969, and March,
1970), and continuing through predictions made in December, 1976 (for
March, 1977, and June, 1977).
3. Tests of unbiasedness

An expectation is rational in Muth's sense if the subjective expectation
held is identical to the corresponding mathematical expectation of the
particular variable in question. Hence a key property of rational interest rate
expectations is that they are unbiased6 that is,

r1=1_r±u,
where r

(I)

the observed value of an interest rate at time t, 1_5r is the

is

expectation of r1 held at time t — s, and u is a zero-mean finite-variance
disturbance term which may be serially correlated according to an (.s — 1)order moving-average process7 but is uncorrelated with
Following
Theil (1966), a test for unbiasedness in this context is to retrcss the survey
expectations on the corresponding realizations according to
r1

= +fl1_r + u,

(2)

and to define unbiasedness as the null hypothesis8

H0:(,/3)=(0,1).

(3)

"It is well known that, because of Jensen's inequality, expectations of asset yields and asset
prices (which are inversely related) cannot both be unbiased. See Lintner (1969) for evidence
that the approximation involved in assuming one to be unbiased, when what is unbiased is in
fact the other, is small. The tests presented below simply assume that it is the yield expectations
which are unbiased.
7The familiar statement that errors must be serially uncorrelated strictly applies only to one-

period-ahead expectations. For s=2, for example, the error u2, made at t—3 in predicting
r,_1 is not yet known when the expectation ,_2r is formed, so that u,, and u2,_1 can be
correlated (but u, cannot be correlated with u2_2, or any earlier errors): hence a2, can follow a
first-order moving-average process.
81n addition, the rationality hypothesis includes the restriction on the serial correlation of a,,
specified above.

Table 1 presents the results of performing this test using ordinary least
squares for the 3-months-ahead and 6-months-ahead Goldsmith-Nagan
survey predictions for six market interest rates, including in each case the
estimated c and /3 values with their corresponding standard errors, the Fstatistic associated with the null hypothesis, and the Durbin—Watson statistic.

Despite a general tendency to >O and /3<i,9 the test resultson the whole

give mixed answers to whether the survey expectations are unbiased
predictors of future interest rates. On the basis of the F-statistics shown, only
in the single case of 6-months-ahead predictions for municipal bonds do the

results warrant rejecting the null hypothesis (unbiasedness) at the 90%
confidence level or better. By contrast, the indicated serial correlation of the
disturbances constitutes a prima facie contradiction of rationality.10 Under

rationality the 3-months-ahead prediction errors must be serially
uncorrelated, yet the Durbin—Watson statistics show significant serial
correlation of the residuals at the 95 % level for the two long-term bond
rates. The 6-months-ahead prediction errors must be (at most) first-order
moving-average processes under rationality, yet inspection of the correlogram
91f the ,_,r value reported in the survey is not identical to the market's expectation but
instead measures it with some error, then the estimation of (2) is subject to an errors-in-variables
problem implying a downward bias to the estimated /3 value.

investigate the rationality of expectations of price inflation.

The general tendency to >O and J3<1 in the results shown in table 1.
together with the high probability that the error made at time t —s in
predicting any one interest rate for time t may be correlated with the
contemporaneous error made in predicting the others, suggests that ordinary
least squares on a single-equation basis may be an inappropriate procedure
for testing the unbiasedness of the survey expectations. Table 2 presents the
results of testing the null hypothesis of unbiasedness by applying Zellner's
''The first-order autocorrelation is greater than 0.5 for four of the six error series (the other
two values are 0.47 and 0.48), and in all six the higher-order autocorrelations are negative. For

first-order moving-average process against more general autoregressive moving-average
processes.

assume that the errors are normally distributed. Evidence for stock market data shows that
equity returns are non-normal [see, e.g., Fama (1965)], but there need be no connection between
the form of the distribution of equity returns and the form of the distribution of interest rate
prediction errors. The small number of observations here does not seem to warrant a formal test
for normality.

(1962) 'seemingly unrelated' regression procedure first to the 3-months-ahead

predictions and then to the 6-months-ahead predictions for all six interest
rates jointly. The results for the individual estimated coefficients, especially
for the 6-months-ahead predictions, indicate an even greater tendency to
>0 and /3<1 (and both low Durbin—Watson statistics and correlograms
unlikely to come from first-order moving-average processes13) than under
ordinary least squares. The test statistic ., based on the logarithm of the

ratio of restricted to unrestricted likelihood function values, warrants
rejecting the joint hypothesis of unbiasedness across all the 'seemingly
unrelated' regressions at the 90% confidence level for the 3-months-ahead

predictions and at the 99% confidence level for the 6-months-ahead

4. Tests of efficiency

A second key property of rational expectations is that they incorporate
efficiently all available information, including that contained in previously
realized outcomes of the series being predicted. Hence rational expectations

and the corresponding realizations share a common autoregressive
representation. For example, if r follows a given stochastic process, then the
rational expectation of r, must follow the same stochastic process. Following
Pesando (1975), a test for efficiency in this context is to estimate the paired
regressions
r1 = $o +

f3 r — + v,,

and to define efficiency as the null hypothesis'5

14The test statistic ).= —2ln(maxLR/maxL ) is distributed as y2(Z), where Z is the number of
parameter restrictions (here 12). The underying log likelihood values are —120.71 for the 3months-ahead predictions and — 146.15 for the 6-months-ahead predictions.

51t is useful to note that this test is robust in the presence of an incomplete specification of
the correct information set (i.e., if market participants in fact use information other than past
interest rates in forming their interest rate expectations), because under the efficiency hypothesis
omitted regressors lead to the same bias in both sets of estimated coefficients. As Mullineaux
(1978) has pointed out, however, the test does suffer from heteroskedasticity, since under rational
expectations var (re) <var (r).

6-months-ahead predictions of all six interest rates, and for the 3-monthsahead predictions of three of the six interest rates.16

5. Tests of consistency

The efficiency property of rational expectations has a further implication
as in the Goldsmith—Nagan survey
multiple

for cases in which

predictions for the same variable span overlapping time periods. In
particular, rational expectations apply the efficiently incorporated

information consistently across such overlapping time periods; in other
words, they correctly apply the chain rule of forecasting. Generalizing
Pesando (1975), a test for consistency in this context is to estimate the paired
regressions (4') as above and

and to define consistency as the null hypothesis17
'6Such rejections are common in large data samples, in which tiny differences can be

statistically significant, but are more striking in a small sample like this one with less than 30
degrees of freedom. The alternative form of the efficiency test suggested by Mullineaux (1978) to
side-step the heteroskedasticity problem gives essentially identical results.

Unlike the efficiency test described in section 4. the consistency test, which reduces to a
form of Meiselman's (1962) 'error-learning' process, is not necessarily robust in the presence of a
misspecification of the correct information set.

For s = 1 time period, (4") simply reduces to (4'). so that the consistency test

reduces to the trivial replication of an identity. For s = 2 or more time

the consistency of the 3-months-ahead and 6-months-ahead Goldsmith—

6. Tests of errors' orthogonality to costlessly available information

The tests in section 4 focus on the efficiency property implied by the
rationality of expectations as measured through autoregressive structures. i.e..

through the efficiency with which expectations incorporate information
contained in lagged realizations of the same variable. Rational expectations
(according to Muth's definition) are efficient in a broader sense, however, in
that they incorporate all available information to the point which equates the

associated marginal cost and marginal benefit. Rational expectations
therefore incorporate fully any and all information which is available at no

cost, and any information fully incorporated in this sense will be
uncorrelated with the errors associated with rational expectations.19 A test of
"'The alternative form of the consistency test suggested by Mullineaux (1978) gives even
stronger results that warrant rejecting the null hypothesis at the 90 confidence level for all
interest rates other than three-month Treasury bills, at the 95 level for all but three-month
bills and municipal bonds, but at the 99% level only for utility bonds.
isSee Friedman (1979) for a discussion of the importance of the error orthogonality
property
of rational expectations in the context of macroeconomic policy models like those cited in the
introductory section above.

Although one could in principle conduct a widespread search among
possible (and logical) candidates for the information set I, doing so would
clearly render meaningless any statistical tests based on a stated number of
degrees of freedom. Instead the tests presented here arbitrarily consider five

familiar macro series that not only are costlessly available to market
participants but also feature prominently in typical discussions of the interest

rate outlook. Three of these macro series (the unemployment rate, the
growth rate of industrial production, and price inflation), with 4-quarter lags
on each, presumably provide information related to the overall cyclical state
of the economy. The other two (the growth rate of the money stock, and the
federal government deficit), with 2-quarter lags, provide information about
the most recent direction of monetary and fiscal policy. In each case the tests
exclude the most recent quarter's value.20

Table 5 presents the F-statistics which result from performing this test
for the orthogonality of the Goldsmith—Nagan survey predictions' errors with
respect to these five macro series. The results suggest two sharp distinctions.

First, the survey predictions of the four short-term interest rates almost
uniformly appear to be rational in the sense of efficiently incorporating the
information contained in these common macro series, but the predictions of
the two long-term interest rates show just the opposite result. In other words,
survey respondents could have significantly improved their predictions both
of utility bond yields and of municipal bond yields by better exploiting the
information contained in these sources. Secondly, the growth rate of the
money stock stands out as the only series which is orthogonal to the errors
made in predicting both short- and long-term interest rates.

months-ahead horizons, surveyed regularly over eight years by The

Goldsmith—Na gan Bond and Money Market Letter, provide results ranging

from mixed to unfavorable to the hypothesis that market participants
expectations are rational in Muth's sense.
Tests show that the survey respondents did not make unbiased predictions,
that (especially for the 6-months-ahead predictions) they did not efficiently
exploit the information contained in past interest rate movements, that their

respective 3-months-ahead and 6-months-ahead predictions failed to be
consistent in the sense required for rationality, and that (for long-term but
not short-term interest rates) their predictions failed to exploit efficiently the

information contained in common macroeconomic and macro-policy
variables.

What should one make of these results? It is important to recall that, as is
always the case in empirical work dealing with unobservable quantities, each
hypothesis tested here is actually a joint hypothesis. In each case one subhypothesis is that market participants' expectations exhibit a stated property
(unbiasedness, consistency, etc.), while the companion sub-hypothesis is that

the survey data measure these expectations accurately. The two subhypotheses are inseparable, and each test performed here is a joint test of the
two together.
Hence one response to these results
surely the easiest response, and
perhaps the most comforting — would be simply to conclude that the data
do not accurately measure market participants' expectations.

An alternative response, in contrast, would accept the survey data as
providing an accurate indication of market expectations and to conclude that
these tests provide at least some small amount of direct evidence counter to

the hypothesis, which is often simply assumed to be valid, that expectations
are rational as defined by Muth. Given the crucial importance of rational
expectations' error-orthogonality property in the context of macroeconomic
policy models, the results on the exploitation of common macro series are
especially instructive in this regard. For long-term interest rates (in contrast
to short-term interest rates), market participants made prediction errors that
were significantly correlated with all but one of the series tested. The single
exception is the growth rate of the money stock, which even predictions of
perhaps because of the strong
long-term rates exploited efficiently

'monetarist' emphasis of the financial press during the last decade. Apart

from the money stock, however, these results suggest that market
participants were unable to unravel the role of familiar macroeconomic
variables in the determination of long-term interest rates sufficiently to form
expectations meeting Muth's requirements for rationality.
