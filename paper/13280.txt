Flattened Inflation-Output Tradeoff and Enhanced Anti-Inflation Policy: Outcome of Globalization?
Assaf Razin and Alon Binyamini
NBER Working Paper No. 13280
July 2007
JEL No. E31,F3,F4
ABSTRACT
The paper provides a unified analysis of globalization effects on the Phillips curve and monetary policy,
in a New-Keynesian framework. The main proposition of the paper is twofold. Labor, goods, and capital
mobility flatten the tradeoff between inflation and activity. If policy makers are guided by the welfare
criterion of the representative household, globalization forces also lead monetary policy to be more
aggressive with regard to inflation fluctuations but, at the same time, more benign with respect to the
output-gap fluctuations.

1. Introduction
It has been observed, by economists and policy makers, that the short-run tradeoff
between inflation and activity has recently become flatten.
Bean (2006) writes succinctly about this trend, as follows.
”One of the most notable developments of the past decade or so has been the apparent
flattening of the short-run trade-off between inflation and activity. The seventies were
characterized by an almost vertical relationship in the United Kingdom, in which attempt
to hold unemployment below its natural rate resulted in rising inflation. In the eighties,
the downward sloping relationship reappears, as inflation was squeezed out of the system
by the slack of the economy. However, since the early Nineties, the relationship looks to
have been rather flat. Three factors - increased specialization; the intensification of
product market competition; and the impact of that intensified competition and migration
on the behavior of wages-should all work to flatten the short-run tradeoff between
inflation and domestic activity.” 1
Recent evidence on the decline in the sensitivity of U.S. inflation to unemployment, and
other measures of resource utilization, includes also Roberts (2006) and Williams (2006).
Work by staff at the Federal Reserve Board indicates that this result generally holds
across a variety of regression specifications, estimation methods, and data definitions.
See also Ihrig et al (forthcoming).

Similarly, Mishkin (2007) writes about the US inflation-output tradeoff: “The finding that inflation is less
responsive to the unemployment gap, suggests that fluctuations in resource utilization will have smaller
implications for inflation than used to be the case. From the point of view of policymakers, this
development is a two-edged sword: On the plus side, it implies that an overheating economy will tend to
generate a smaller increase in inflation. On the negative side, however, a flatter Phillips curve also implies
that a given increase in inflation will be more costly to wring out of the system".

-2A massive globalization process swept emerging markets in Latin America, the European
transition economies, and the East Asia emerging economies in the recent two decades.
The 1992 single-market reform in Europe, and the formation of the Euro zone, are
remarkable episodes of globalization. Similarly, emerging markets, including China and
India, became significantly more open.

Wynne and Kersting (2007) note that in the 1970s, more than three quarters of industrial
countries had restrictions of some sort on international financial transactions. By the
2000s, none did. Likewise restrictions on these transactions, among emerging markets
fell from 78 percent in the 1970s to 58 percent in the 2000s.

An important aspect of openness relates to labor flows. International migrants constitute
2.9 percent of the world population in the 2000s, up from 2.1 percent in the 1975. In
some countries changes have been more dramatic. In Israel in the 1990s there was a surge
of immigrants, up to 17 percent of the population, and the central Bank accomplished
also a sizable decline of inflation. It is possible that the two intimately episodes are
related.2 In Spain in 1995, the percentages of foreigners in the population and in the labor
force were, respectively, below 1% and below 0.5%. At the end of 2006, these rates were
around 9% and 14%, respectively. The impact of the Spanish immigration boom on the
Phillips curve has been recently addressed by Bentolila, Dolado and Jimeno (2007).

Recently, inflation around the world went down substantially. The average annual
inflation rate, among developing countries, was 41 percent in the early 1980s, and came
down to 13 percent towards the end of the 1990s. Global inflation in the 1990s has
dropped from 30 percent a year to about 4 percent a year.

Indeed, Rogoff (2003, 2004) is one of the first to observe that favorable factors have been
helping to drive down global inflation in the last two decades. An hypothesis, which he

2

-3put forth, is that “globalization - interacting with deregulation and privatization - has
played a strong supporting role in the past decade’s disinflation.”3

Evidence on the effect of globalization on the Phillips curve includes Loungani, Razin
and Yuen (2001) and Razin and Loungani (2007). Previously, Romer (1993, 1998), and
Lane (1997) show that inflation and trade liberalization are negatively, and significantly,
correlated in large (flexible exchange rate) OECD economies. Gali and Monacelli, (2003)
analyze the effect of exchange rate movements on inflation.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a unified analysis, of the effects of various
features of globalization on the inflation-output tradeoff, in a New-Keynesian framework.
Globalization features are international capital mobility, international trade in goods, and
international migration. We demonstrate a common effect of these different channels of
openness on the trade-off. That is, each one of these channels helps to flatten the Phillips
curve.

The reason why New-Keynesian framework is capable of generating a trade off, between
inflation and economic activity, is that producer desired prices would rise with the
economy's output, when marginal costs slope upward due to diminishing return to scale.
Furthermore, because as labor supply increases, workers experience increasing marginal
disutility of labor. As a result, real-wage demands could rise. Increased wage demands
put an upward pressure on the marginal cost, and consequently on the producer desired
prices. Thus, our analytical challenge is to find how trade in goods, financial openness,
and migration affect economic output utilization and wage demands.

To accomplish our task we extend the New-Keynesian model in the following directions:
(1) International labor mobility; both in- and out-migration. The presumption is that labor

Borio and Filardo (2007) present cross country evidence, in support of their contention, that global factors
have recently become empirically more relevant, for domestic inflation determination.

-4flows tend to mitigate wage demands, because they introduce a substitution between
domestic and foreign labor; (2) International trade in goods. The presumption is that trade
leads to specialization in domestic production and diversification in domestic
consumption. Therefore, trade tends to weaken the link between domestic production and
domestic consumption. As a result, the effect of the fluctuations of domestic production
on the inflation is also weakened by the presence of international trade in goods; (3)
Financial integration with the rest of the world. International trade in financial assets
allows households to smooth their consumption over time and over states of nature. Such
consumption smoothing also mitigates the fluctuations in the representative household
labor supply. Smoothed fluctuations weaken the link between domestic output
fluctuations and those associated with inflation.

The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the analytical framework
and analyzes the effect of migration on the marginal cost. Section 3 derives the aggregate
supply relationship for various aspect of openness. Section 4 derives a utility-based
quadratic loss function, from the representative household utility function, for different
regimes of openness. Section 5 derives the optimal monetary policy rule under discretion,
for different regimes of trade in goods, trade in financial assets, and international
mobility of labor. Section 6 concludes.

2. Analytical Framework
The analytical framework draws on the recent New-Keynesian macroeconomics
literature (See Woodford (2003)). Main features of the open-economy NewKeynesian model are:
(1) The domestic economy produces a continuum of differentiated goods. Decisions
of the representative household are governed by Dixit-Stiglitz preferences
(generating fixed elasticities). Purchasing power parity conditions prevail for the
flexible price goods and foreign firms' prices are taken as exogenous.

-5(2) The representative-household utility is defined over consumption and leisure, as
in the standard micro-based welfare analysis.
(3) There is international trade in goods and financial assets.
(4) Labor supply is divided between domestic and foreign destinations. Exported
labor receive wage premium over unskilled foreign labor. Imported labor is
unskilled and native born labor commands an endogenously determined skill
premium.
(5) Price updates are staggered (see Calvo (1983)). Namely, producers update prices
upon receiving a signal drawn from a stochastic distribution.
(6) World prices are exogenous (that is, a small open economy assumption).

2.1. The Representative Household
We assume that all goods are tradable. There is a continuum of goods, which is uniformly
distributed over the unit interval, so that j ∈ [0,1] . The utility function of the
representative household is:

where E is the expectations operator. The instantaneous utility function consists of a
consumption composite, Ct , domestic labor supply, hthom e ( j ) , exported labor supply,

htexp ort ( j ) , and of real money balances,

Mt
(the ratio of money holdings, M t , and the
Pt

price level, Pt ). We denote the discount factor by β and the labor disutility parameter by

ϕ . The relative disutility of labor export in terms of domestic labor supply is indicated by
the parameter φ > 1 .4 The term ξt is a vector of preference shocks. The consumption
composite, Ct is a Dixit-Stiglitz composite of goods produced at home and imported
goods:

where n is the number of domestically produced goods, in the consumption basket. Thus,
1 − n can serve as a trade openness parameter. Subscripts H and W indicate home

of substitution among different goods in the consumption composite.

⎣

(4)

where y t ( j ) is the output level of the j th firm and At is an exogenous aggregate
technology shock, common to all firms. The elasticity of substitution, between imported
and native-born labor inputs, is given by

ν

ν −1

, where ν > 1 , and the degree of returns-

to-scale is given by χ < 1 . The variable htimport ( j ) is the labor supply by immigrants,
employed by domestic firm j . We assume that native born are skilled, and immigrant
labor is unskilled. (This captures labor market patterns in an industrialized economy).

⎡ 1⎤
Hence, ψ ∈ ⎢0, ⎥ . It follows that the marginal productivity of domestic labor exceeds
⎣ 2⎦
that of immigrant labor, for the same amount of labor input. Skill premium in the foreign
market, µtW , is exogenous. Skill premium in the domestic market, µtH , is endogenously
determined.

2.3. Skill Premium in the Domestic Market

through out-migration flows.

where the term yt ( j )

Where the real wage, wtW , in the foreign market, is defined by:
wtW ≡

ε t ⋅ WtW

;

Thus, the exogenous term zt consists of technology and preferences parameters, the
technology shock, the foreign market skill premium, and the labor wage in the foreign
market.

If the labor market is open to out-migration but closed to in-migration, the marginal cost
function still takes the form of equation (8); in this case however, the exogenous term zt
will be replaced by

-9It can be verified that

z tout > z t . That is, in-migration exerts a lowering cost effect akin

to technological progress.
To see the effect of in- and out-migration on the marginal cost, compare equation (8) with
the corresponding expression for the marginal cost function with no migration:

mctclosed ( j ) = ztclosed ⋅

1+ϕ − χ

uc is the derivative of u with respect to C , and
θ

⎤ θ −1
Yt ≡ ⎢ ∫ ( yt ( j )) θ ⋅ dj ⎥ .
⎣0
⎦

The output elasticity is equal to (1 − χ ) / χ in equation (8), while the corresponding
elasticity is equal to (1 + ϕ − χ ) / χ in equation (9). This means that in the presence of
out-migration, which tends to make the labor supply faced by domestic producers more
flexible, the output elasticity of the marginal cost decreases.

When the labor market is closed to out-migration, wage demand faced by domestic
producers is upward sloping, both under in-migration and under completely closed labor
market. However, when the labor market is open to in-migration, domestic producers
face an expanded labor supply: additionally to the skilled native born labor supply (with
upward sloping wage demand), they also face a complementary unskilled foreign labor

- 10 supply (with exogenously determined wage demand). That means that in-migration
works essentially like a productivity shock, similar to At .

To summarize, out-migration reduces the output elasticity of the marginal cost, whereas
in-migration essentially works like a positive domestic productivity shock that lowers
marginal costs.

3. The Aggregate Supply
3.1

Perfect International Mobility of Goods, Capital and Labor

When there is perfect mobility of goods, then domestic producers specialize, and n < 1 .
)
)
Perfect mobility of capital implies perfect consumption smoothing; that is Ct = CtN .

The approximated aggregate supply curve is derived from the log linearization of the
aggregate supply equations, around a purely deterministic steady state.

Upper hat denotes proportional deviation from the purely deterministic steady state, and
the superscript N denotes the "natural" value of real variables, that is, the value of a
variable that would have prevailed under completely flexible prices.

In the case of perfect mobility of labor, capital, and goods, the approximate aggregate
supply curve is given by:

where PF ,t is the foreign price index.

The focus of attention of this paper is the slope of the aggregate supply curve. The slope
is ψ 1 ≡

κnω p
.
1 + ω pθ

The slope of the aggregate supply curve increases with n ; (where 1 - n is the trade
openness parameter); and with κ .

Other terms in the aggregate supply curve capture the effects on the domestic inflation of
foreign output shocks, foreign wage shocks, and past, present and future real exchange
rate shocks.

Perfect International Mobility of Goods and Capital, with no Labor
Mobility

In the case of perfect international mobility of goods and capital, but with no labor
mobility, the aggregate supply curve is given by: 5

an open economy with trade in goods and in capital assets.

where ω is the elasticity of marginal cost with respect to domestic output. Note
that ω = ω p + ωw , where ωw is the elasticity of wage demand to domestic output. That
is ω > ω p . Therefore; shutting off migration (particularly out migration) raises the slope
of the aggregate supply.6

In this case, the slope of the Philips curve is:

Perfect International Mobility of Goods, with no Capital Mobility and no
Labor Mobility

If the domestic economy is not integrated to the international financial market, then there
is no possibility of consumption smoothing, and we have that the value of aggregate
current spending equals the value of aggregate domestic output:
PˆC ,t Cˆ t = PˆY ,t Yˆt

;

PˆC ,t Cˆ tN = PˆY ,t Yˆt N

where PˆC ,t is the CPI-based price level and PˆY ,t is the GDP deflator.

In this case, the aggregate-supply curve is:

For the case of perfect mobility of goods with no mobility of capital and labor, the slope

The Closed Economy

Because with the closed trade account, the consumption of each good equal domestic
production of the good, production is fully diversified. Namely, n = 1 . If, in addition, the
capital account is closed and in- and out-migration is not possible, the aggregate-supply
curve becomes:

π)t =

κ
⋅ (ω + σ ) ⋅ xt + βEtπ)t +1 .

(13)

In this case the slope of the Phillips curve is:

Slope of the Aggregate Supply Curve: Regime Comparisons.

There is a systematic ranking of the slope of the Philips curve across openness regimes.
From subsections 3.1-3.4 one can verify that ψ 1 < ψ 2 < ψ 3 < ψ 4 .

- 14 This means that in every successive round of the opening up of the economy,
globalization contributes to flatten the aggregate supply curve. The intuition is that when
an economy opens up to trade in goods, it tends to specialize in production but to
diversify in consumption. This means the number of domestically produced goods (= n ),
is less then the number of domestically consumed goods (= 1). Consequently, the
commodity composition of the consumption and output baskets, which are identical if the
trade account is closed, are different when trade in goods is possible. As a result, the
correlation between fluctuations in output and in consumption (which is equal to unity in
the case of a closed trade account) is less than unity if the economy is opened to
international trade in goods.

When the capital account is open, then the correlation between fluctuations in
consumption and domestic output is farther weakened, this is because with open capital
account the representative household can smooth consumption through international
borrowing and lending and thereby separate current consumption from current output.
The inflation effects of shocks to the marginal cost are therefore reduced, because the
fluctuations in labor supply are also smoothed, as a consequence of the consumption
smoothing.

Out-migration reduces the output elasticity of the marginal cost (compare equation (8)
and equation (9)). This implies that, in the presence of out-migration, shocks to domestic
output will have smaller effects on inflation, compared to a closed economy. 7
When the economy opens up to in-migration, the proportional factor, zt , of the marginal
cost curve is lowered. Therefore, the effect of demand shocks on inflation is weakened.

7

If the economy imports intermediate goods there is also a real exchange rate effect. The real exchange
rate affects the output inflation tradeoff, even in the absence of other cost push shocks. Clarida Gali and
Gertler (2000) discuss this effect.

4. Utility-Based Loss Function
Distortions in the New-Keynesian equilibrium can be grouped into two types:
(1) Because consumption smoothing is desirable, fluctuations of the output gap,
which are correlated with consumption, reduce welfare-reducing.
(2) Because an efficient allocation of the labor supply implies an equal division of
labor across differentiated goods (recall that the disutility of labor is a convex
function), any cross good dispersion in output is distortionary. Given that not all
the prices are updated simultaneously, inflation generates a distortion.
The utility based-loss function adequately captures these distortions.
The utility-based loss function is:8
∞

[

]

2
L = E0 ∑ β t π)t2 + λ (xt − x * ) ,
t =0

(14)

where x* is the (log) ratio of the non-distorted aggregate output and the monopolisticcompetitive distorted output, under perfect price flexibility; and the parameter λ is the
weight of the output-gap term relative to the inflation term.

We find that:

λ=

ψi
; i = 1,2,3,4 ,
θ

where ψ i is the slope of the aggregate supply curve (the inverse of the sacrifice ratio);
and θ is the elasticity of substitution across differentiated goods. Recall that in the
previous subsection we demonstrated that:

ψ1 < ψ 2 < ψ 3 < ψ 4 .
Thus, the ranking of the relative weight of the output-gap term in the loss function is:

λ1 < λ2 < λ3 < λ4 .

8

In appendix A we derive the utility based loss function along the lines of Woodford (2003). We assume
that foreign producers use a local currency pricing strategy and they update prices at the same frequency as
domestic producers. Note also that we abstract from the money term in the utility function.

- 16 Opening up an economy to trade in goods and capital flows weakens the correlation
between the fluctuations in the output gap and the fluctuations in consumption. Recall
that the representative household welfare depends on consumption, not on domestic
output. Therefore, the output-gap weight in the loss function falls as an economy opens
up to trade, and capital assets.

With migration, the representative household’s income and output are separated, one
from the other. Because consumption level is associated with the income level (not GDP
levels), fluctuations of domestic output become less important to the representative
household compared to the case of no migration. Thus, the output-gap weight in the loss
function declines when migration is allowed.

We thus establish that the output-gap weight in the utility-based loss function decreases
with the opening up of the economy, in every successive round of opening up.

5. Optimal Monetary Policy Under Discretion
In this section we use the utility-based loss function, along with the aggregate supply and
aggregate demand relationships, to formulate an optimal monetary policy rule, under
discretion.

The approximated aggregate demand equation is:
)
xt = Et xt +1 − σ −1 (iH ,t − Etπ)t +1 − r)t n ) ,

(15)

where r)t n is the deviation of the natural rate of real interest, from steady state.

The approximated (real) interest-parity equation is:
)
)
)
)
)
)
qt = Et qt +1 + (iF ,t − Etπ F ,t +1 ) − (iH ,t − Etπ t +1 ) .

(16)

- 17 )
The optimal monetary policy rule is obtained by choosing the path of π)t , xt and qt so
as to minimize the loss function in equation (14), subject to the aggregate supply
equation, aggregate demand equation and the (real) interest parity rule, in every period

t = 1,2,..... .
The optimal policy rule (under discretion) depends on the degree of openness9 (step by

Cecchetti et al (2007) suggest that aggressive monetary policy is the key explanation for the flattening of
the trade-off. They argue that the disinflationary impact of globalization is limited, and partly attributable to
the fixed exchange rate regime, in some of the East Asian countries. They analyze empirically the change
in ex-post Taylor rule, from the high inflation era, to the low inflation era. Our theory can provide an
explanation for this change in the Taylor rule.

The expressions for γ π demonstrates that the optimal monetary policy under discretion
becomes more aggressive with respect to inflation, when the economy opens up to
migration, trade in goods and capital flow. In contrast, the expression for

γ x demonstrates that the monetary policy becomes more benign toward fluctuations in
the output-gap when the economy opens up, in every globalization round.

6. Conclusion
The paper provides a unified analysis of the effects of international mobility of goods,
labor, and finance on (1) the Phillips curve; (2) the weights of inflation and output gap in
the approximated, utility-based, loss function; and (3) the optimal interest rate rule under
discretion, within a unified New-Keynesian open economy framework. We demonstrate
how an endogenously determined monetary policy, which is guided by the welfare
criterion of the representative household, becomes more aggressive with regard to

- 19 inflation fluctuations but more benign with respect to output-gap fluctuations, when the
economy opens up to in- and out-migration, trade in goods, and capital flows.

The paper assumes that the flex-price markup is constant, unaffected by globalization
forces. But there has been some evidence of greater restraints on domestic prices and
wage growth in sectors more exposed to international competition, such as textiles and
electronics. Chen, Imbs and Scott (2004) analyzed disaggregated data for EU
manufacturing over the period 1988-2000. They find that increased openness lowers
prices by reducing markups and by raising productivity. In response to an increase in
openness, markups show a steep short run decline, which partly reverse later, while
productivity rises in a manner that increases overtime. If globalization reduces the
markup, our model predicts that this effect, as by itself, leads to a more forceful antiinflation policy, and lessens the attention given by the policy maker to the fluctuations in
economic activity.

Finally, as we know, a more frequent price updating steepens the tradeoff between
inflation and activity. However, to our knowledge, neither theory nor empirical evidence
exists, in support of any systematic relationship between globalization and frequency of
price updating.

Appendix A: Derivation of the Utility-Based Loss Function
In this appendix we derive a quadratic approximation for the welfare criterion of the
representative household, following Woodford (2003).10

In the full mobility case, a first stage in the log-linear approximation of the utility
function, around the purely deterministic steady state, yields:

where Varj pt ( j ) is the price dispersion of domestically produced goods; and the
expression " t.i. p." collects terms that are independent of monetary policy.

Using the Calvo (1983) set up it follows that:

where α * is the foreign country Calvo parameter.

We assume that foreign producers use a local currency pricing strategy and that they
update prices at the same frequency as domestic producers, that is, α = α * . It follows
that while optimizing, local and foreign producers set the same price: p) H* ,t = p) F* ,t . Under
these assumptions, we get, as in the closed economy, that:

Appendix B: Optimal Monetary Policy under Discretion
In this appendix we derive the optimal monetary policy under discretion. To do this, we
first approximate the aggregate demand, the aggregate supply and the interest parity.
Then we minimize the utility-based loss function subject to these relationships.

B.1.Aggregate Demand
Maximizing equation (1) with respect to BH ,t , subject to budget constraints, equation (3),
and log linearizing the first order conditions, yields:

rt n is the deviation of the natural real interest rate, from its level at the purely
deterministic steady state level.

B.2.Interest Parity
The approximated equation describing interest parity is:

)
ε)t = Etε)t +1 + iF ,t − iH ,t .

(B. 3)

Subtracting the expression (Etπ)F ,t +1 + Etπ)t +1 ) from both sides of equation (B.3), we get
the interest parity in real terms, as follows:

)
qt = Et qt +1 + (iF ,t − Etπ F ,t +1 ) − (iH ,t − Etπ t +1 )

.

B.3. Optimal Policy Rule
The optimal monetary rule is obtained upon minimizing the utility-based loss function,
subject to the aggregate supply equation, the aggregate demand equation, and the real
interest parity.
