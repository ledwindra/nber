    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine how a 16-week cut in potential unemployment insurance (UI) duration in Missouri affected search behavior of UI recipients and the aggregate labor market. Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD), we estimate a marginal effect of maximum duration on UI and nonemployment spells of approximately 0.5 and 0.3 respectively. We use RDD estimates to simulate the unemployment rate assuming no market-level externalities. The simulated response closely approximates the estimated change in the unemployment rate following the benefit cut, suggesting that even in a period of high unemployment the labor market absorbed this influx of workers without crowding-out other jobseekers.\n\n",
