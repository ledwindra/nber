    "abstract": "\n\nWithin countries, state-run banks\u2019 lending correlates with prior money growth; otherwise similar private-sector banks\u2019 lending does not. Aggregate credit and investment growth correlate with prior money growth more where banking systems are more state-run. Size and liquidity differences between state-run and private-sector banks do not drive these results; further tests discount broad classes of alternative explanations. Tests exploiting heterogeneity in likely political pressure on state-run banks associated with privatizations and elections suggest a command-and-control pseudo-monetary policy channel: changes in money growth, perhaps reflecting political pressure on the central bank, change banks\u2019 lending constraints; political pressure actually changes state-run banks\u2019 lending.\n\n",
