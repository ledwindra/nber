    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper I analyze the work on exchange rates and external imbalances by University of Chicago faculty members during the university\u2019s first hundred years, 1892-1992. Many people associate Chicago\u2019s views with Milton Friedman\u2019s advocacy for flexible exchange rates. But, of course, there was much more than that, including the work of J. Laurence Laughlin on bimetallism, Jacob Viner on the balance of payments, Lloyd Metzler on transfers, Harry Johnson on trade and currencies, Lloyd Mints on exchange rate regimes, Robert Mundell on optimal currency areas, and Arnold Harberger on shadow exchange rates, among other. The analysis shows that, although different scholars emphasized different issues, there was a common thread in this research, anchored on the role of relative prices\u2019 changes during the adjustment process.\n\n",
