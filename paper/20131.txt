ABSTRACT
We study the effects of immigration on native welfare in a general equilibrium model featuring two
skill types, search frictions, wage bargaining, and a redistributive welfare state. Our quantitative analysis
suggests that, in all 20 countries studied, immigration attenuates the effects of search frictions. These
gains tend to outweigh the welfare costs of redistribution. Immigration has increased native welfare
in almost all countries. Both high-skilled and low-skilled natives benefit in two thirds of countries,
contrary to what models without search frictions predict. Median total gains from migration are 1.19%
and 1.00% for high and low skilled natives, respectively.

Introduction

Many OECD countries have experienced high immigration rates during the last two decades and
foreign-born workers now make up a significant share of their total labor force. The overall economic effects of immigration on the native population are very much debated. Based on simple
models of factor complementarity, economists have long been optimistic about the existence of a
net immigration surplus for natives (Borjas, 1995). They have also been aware of the redistributive
effects of immigration caused by factor price adjustments (Borjas, 2003). However, once we take
into account labor market frictions and redistributive fiscal policies, the net effect of immigration
on native welfare is harder to calculate. To our knowledge, no previous paper on the effects of immigration has taken into account both imperfect competition in the labor market and redistribution.
This paper begins to fill this gap.
We analyze the effects of immigration in the presence of skill heterogeneity, search frictions,
wage bargaining, and a redistributive welfare state. Our setup is rich enough to replicate the large
observed differences in labor market outcomes between natives and immigrants across countries.
Matching a number of salient moments, we calibrate and simulate our model to provide quantitative
predictions for 20 OECD countries for three different scenarios. While it is impossible to obtain
closed-form solutions for our full general equilibrium model, analytical results are available for
simplified versions.
We begin by describing some relevant empirical regularities. Four important characteristics of
immigrants and host countries shape the effects of immigration on labor markets and redistribution. The first statistic relates to the skill composition of immigrants relative to natives.1 It is a
key aspect for the traditional complementarity-competition effects studied in most of the existing
literature. In particular, the share of tertiary-educated immigrants relative to the share of tertiaryeducated natives determines which group of native workers would be more exposed to potential
competition and which would benefit from complementarity. In about a third of the surveyed countries, on average, immigrants are better educated than natives. In some of the major European
host economies, however (e.g. France and Germany), they are substantially less educated.
The second important statistic is related to the relative wage levels of immigrants and natives. In
all countries surveyed, and in each skill group, natives command a wage premium over immigrants.
These premia vary significantly across countries, however; they are highest in Italy and Greece, and
lowest in Australia, the United States and Switzerland. The wage gap may reflect differences in
(effective) labor productivity. But it may also relate to differences in the outside options of natives
relative to migrants. These two determinants of wage effects have different implications on the
labor market effects of immigrants.
The third statistic relates to the fact that, in most countries, both low and high skilled immigrants are much more likely to be unemployed than natives. All countries in our sample provide
1

We use ‘skill’ and ‘educational attainment’ interchangeably.

2

some sort of unemployment insurance, albeit at very different levels of generosity. So, heterogeneity
in unemployment risk leads to net redistribution from the group with lower unemployment rates
to the group with higher unemployment rates.
Finally, the size of the government (measured by share of taxes or public expenditures in GDP)
is a crucial statistic to assess the net fiscal effect of immigrants. Cross-country heterogeneity is huge
and the presence of generous redistribution programs in some countries has important implications
for native welfare if immigrants and natives differ with respect to their income and unemployment
probabilities.
These features describe four different margins through which immigrants affect native welfare.
In our quantitative analysis, we aim to capture all of them. To this end, we must go beyond
the complementarity and labor market competition channel of the canonical model. We need
a setup in which wages and unemployment rates can differ for workers with similar educational
attainments, and where the public sector redistributes income to the unemployed and to low wage
earners. Our model combines a production function featuring skill complementarity with a labor
market characterized by search-and-matching.2 Competitive firms create vacancies for high skilled
or low skilled workers. But they cannot distinguish ex ante between natives and immigrants,
who are, within skill groups, perfect substitutes to each other. For given education, our model
allows immigrants to differ from natives with respect to their outside options and their exogenous
job break-up rate. This helps to explain the empirical fact that foreign-born workers face higher
unemployment risk than natives and have higher unemployment rates and lower wages.3 The idea is
that immigrants, whose social networks are to a greater extent through work than those of natives,
suffer more from joblessness than natives.
In equilibrium, immigration affects native welfare through four channels. Two of them work
through the labor market: the traditional complementarity effect on wages and a novel effect
on job-creation. The latter arises from the fact that the ex post value of a match for a firm
depends on whether the worker is a native or an immigrant. An immigrant worker has a lower
outside option, but faces a higher exogenous split rate. Together, these two effects result in higher
or lower incentives for job creation when the share of immigrants in the labor force goes up.
Redistribution also works through two channels: one through unemployment benefits and another
through proportional taxes and lump-sum transfers. How these channels affect native welfare
depends on the relative skill composition of immigrants, as well as on labor market institutions.
We calibrate the parameters of our model such that it matches 11 salient empirical moments
that we have collected for 20 OECD countries. Past immigration rates are taken from the data. We
use the quantitative model to study the effects of the three scenarios on native welfare, separately
for all countries in our sample: (i) a 1% increase in the labor force share of immigrants beyond

homogeneous good that can be used in consumption and investment.

the levels for 2011, keeping the skill composition fixed, (ii) the transition from the status quo to a
hypothetical autarky situation, and (iii) the inflows realized between 2000 and 2011.
Finally, we perform a quantitative comparative statics exercise to better understand the relative
importance of the different mechanisms present in our framework. For this purpose, based on
observed data, we draw a vector of moments for 10,000 artificial economies, calibrate our model to
each of them, and run regressions to obtain conditional correlations between these moments and
our variable of interest: native welfare. Wage and unemployment gaps between immigrants and
natives, and the size of government are found to be important determinants of the welfare effect
of immigrants, stressing the differences between our model and a simpler model with competitive
labor markets which could not deliver those results.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 frames this paper relative to the
existing literature. Section 3 presents cross country variation of measures related to immigrants,
their performance and redistribution in 20 OECD countries. Section 4 presents our model. Section
5 discusses our calibration strategy and provides our quantitative results. Section 6 concludes.

Literature Review

Hanson (2009) points out that the literature on the effects of immigration is characterized by a
“near obsession” with wages.4 This strand of research uses increasingly sophisticated approaches,
based on dividing the labor market into cells to estimate own and cross elasticities of substitution,
and to employ the obtained parameter estimates to simulate the complementarity-substitution
channel of immigration.5 Some recent papers have moved a step forward and applied the structural
empirical framework of the cell-approach to a situation where wages are set non-competitively.
For instance D’Amuri, Ottaviano, and Peri (2010), Felbermayr et al. (2010), Brücker and Jahn
(2011) and Brücker, Jahn, and Upward (2013) postulate, in reduced form, that wages are decreasing
functions of unemployment rates. While these models do allow for unemployment, the labor market
imperfections (wage rigidity and existence of unemployment) are not micro-founded and the role
of labor market institutions is not explicitly modeled. Moreover these studies do not have any role
for the government. With the exception of Felbermayr et al. (2010), they do not calculate welfare
effects, but only wage effects.
In the presence of non-Walrasian features of the labor market, immigration can improve the
efficiency of labor markets and mitigate the effects of existing distortions. This is a corollary of
the theory of the second best. Schmidt, Stilz, and Zimmermann (1994) suggest that immigrants
generate efficiency gains by weakening the bargaining power of labor unions. Borjas (2001) argues
that immigrant workers react more flexibly to differences in job opportunities than native workers because they are not tied to any specific location. Thereby they smooth the labor market.

Longhi, Nijkamp, and Poot (2008) provide a discussion and meta analysis of this literature.
E.g. Borjas (2003) and Ottaviano and Peri (2012) and the references therein.

4

Angrist and Kugler (2003) conclude that low labor market flexibility increases the negative effects
of immigration in Europe. More recently, Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014) study immigration
in a search-and-matching model in which immigrants have inferior outside options than natives.
Hence, bargaining results in lower wages for immigrants ex post, which encourages firms to create more vacancies for all types of workers ex ante. We generalize this idea by allowing matches
with immigrants to have different expected duration than those with natives and by introducing
a welfare state. While the analysis of Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014) is mostly theoretical, our
objective is to conduct a quantitative analysis for a large sample of countries.
There is also a separate literature on the fiscal effects of immigration. Calibrating dynamic
equilibrium models featuring demographics and fiscal policy for the US and Sweden, Storesletten
(2000, 2003) finds that immigration can strongly benefit natives if it occurs in the ‘right’ age bracket
(middle-aged workers) and if immigrants have a sufficiently high employment probability. Realized
migration, however, often falls short from the ideal composition, so that de facto immigration may
be a burden rather than a blessing to the native taxpayer.6 Dustmann and Frattini (2013) provide
a comprehensive analysis of the net fiscal contribution of immigrants in the UK and find an overall
positive impact. However, virtually all papers in this literature abstract from a micro-founded
modeling of labor market imperfections. They focus on a sort of “accounting method” based
on observed taxes and transfers without considering the equilibrium responses of the economy.
Therefore, these analyses do not include complementarity-based welfare gains.
Finally, there are a few papers that evaluate the global welfare gains from immigration, often accruing in large part to the immigrants themselves. Benhabib and Jovanovic (2012) use a model with
human capital externalities as in Lucas (1990) to estimate the level of migration that would maximize world welfare. They find that, from a global perspective, migration ought to be much larger
than it is today. Di Giovanni, Levchenko and Ortega (2014) quantify the welfare effects of international migration in a model that carefully incorporates TFP and skill differences, within a Melitz
(2003) framework of international trade with a home market effect. Docquier, Ozden, and Peri
(2014) evaluate wage and employment gains from immigration and emigration in all OECD countries. They assume a classical perfect competition model of labor demand and supply for two skills,
capturing therefore only the complementarity effects, plus a possible externality effect from human
capital intensity. None of the mentioned papers include a public sector. Moreover, while a global
perspective is interesting, it is the impact of immigrants on natives in receiving countries that is
most likely to drive immigration policies.

In many countries there is has been a fierce debate about the net fiscal contribution of immigrants. For Germany,
see Sinn et al. (2001) and Bonin (2002).

Cross-country Summary Statistics

In this section we provide some summary statistics on immigrants and on their relative labor market
performance. We also survey some relevant institutional features of 20 OECD countries. These
facts motivate our modeling approach, and play a central part in our quantitative exercise.7

3.1

Immigrants in the work force

Table 1 provides summary statistics on eight important measures that characterize the structure of
immigration, immigrants’ labor market performance and the generosity of welfare state across the
20 countries in our sample. The data are taken from Censuses or similar sources and are relative
to year 2011 or the closest available year.8 Row [1] of table 1 shows that immigrants make up
a substantial share of the labor force in all countries considered, with the cross-country average
standing at about 17%. They make up almost 10% even in the country with the smallest share
(Portugal).9 Row [2] refers to the skill structure of the migrant labor force relative to the native
one. On average across our 20 countries, the share of tertiary educated immigrants relative to
the share of tertiary educated natives is almost unity. However, there is a substantial amount of
heterogeneity across countries. For example, in Canada, the share of university graduates in the
labor force is 1.63 times bigger among immigrants than among natives. This strong heterogeneity
in relative skill patterns forebodes heterogeneous distributional effects of immigration. Immigrants
can be expected to compete with natives in the same skill category, so that once could expect lowskilled natives to be more likely to benefit from immigration in Canada, and high–skilled natives
in Slovenia.

3.2

Labor market outcomes for natives and immigrants

Native and immigrant workers differ strongly regarding their labor market performances. Rows
[3] and [4] in Table 1 show that, across the countries in our sample, the average wage received by
immigrants is typically lower than the one received by natives, even within the same skill class.
Using EU-SILC and Census data, both for high and low skilled workers, the average yearly wage
paid to immigrants amounts to only 86% of the one paid to natives. There is considerable variation
behind the average. There is no wage gap in Canada for low-skilled workers and in Switzerland for
high-skilled workers. The wage gap for is highest in Greece for low-skilled workers and in Italy for
high-skilled workers.

We have been able to compile a set of comparative and reliable moments for 16 EU member states, plus Switzerland,
the United States, Canada and Australia. See Appendix B for details.
Table 1 shows summary statistics. Table B.1 in our Appendix provides additional detail on each country.
The countries in our sample are, on average, more open to migration than the average OECD country, where the
labor force share of immigrants amounts to 10%. Also note that labor force shares lie substantially above population
shares. The work force includes only migrants with work permits (i.e., in many countries, it excludes, e.g., asylum
seekers and refugees).

We are using several data sources; see Appendix B for details.

The inferior labor market performance of immigrants relative to similarly skilled natives could
have different explanations. First, the wage gaps could be due to lower bargaining power of migrants, as explained above. Second, even within the same skill class, migrants may suffer a productivity disadvantage relative to natives because of inadequate language skills or imperfect portability
of human capital; see Poutvaara (2008). Hence, the value to the firm of filling a vacancy with a
migrant may be higher or lower than filling it with a native. In the absence of directed search, this
means that the expected value of vacancy creation depends on the share of migrants in the labor
force.10
Rows [5] and [6] report the evidence on relative unemployment rates within the groups of low
and high skilled workers. Discrepancies are large, in particular for the high skilled. Cross-country
heterogeneity is large, too. On average, the likelihood of unemployment for an immigrant is 1.6
10

An alternative option, which we rule out in this paper, is that the additional surplus from employing an immigrant may
compensate the firm for the “distaste” of employing immigrants. This would be a classical employer discrimination
motivation.

times and 2.2 times the corresponding likelihood for a native in the low and high skilled labor market
segments, respectively. Unemployment gaps are largest in Switzerland for the low-skilled and in
Austria for the high-skilled, and lowest in the United States for the low-skilled and in Portugal
for the high-skilled. We model these discrepancies by assuming that matches with immigrants are
more likely to break up. The shorter expected longevity of a match with an immigrant reduces
incentives for vacancy creation much like lower migrant productivity.

3.3

Welfare state characteristics

Differential labor market performance has important implications for our analysis: first, it opens
the door for immigration to affect job creation incentives (which may harm or benefit natives);
second, if immigrants have higher unemployment rates, then natives lose from the redistribution
through unemployment benefits. The magnitude of the latter channel depends on the generosity
of benefits. Following the literature, we measure this by the replacement ratio: the percentage of
after-tax wage income replaced by unemployment benefits. Row [7] of Table 1 shows that this rate
varies from 63% in Belgium to 22% in Greece, with the average across countries at about 39%. The
generosity of unemployment benefits affects the effective bargaining power of workers, their wages,
and the degree of labor market tightness.
Quantitatively even more relevant, however, is the scale of the overall redistribution. Many
European countries engage in substantial redistribution. Government spending as a share of GDP
(which is also similar to total taxes relative to GDP) is a good measure of the redistributive role of
the government. Row [8] of Table 1 reports the summary statistics for our sample. The government
spending share averages 45%, with Switzerland occupying the lowest level (33%) and Denmark the
highest (54%). Transfers (and the provision of public goods) may imply redistribution towards
migrants, but they also affect the distributional effect of immigration within the group of natives.

Model

We model each country as an economy open to international capital flows, but small enough to
have no effect on world interest rates.11 There is no international trade in goods, and the stock of
international migrants of different skills is taken as exogenous. Our focus is on understanding the
economic effects of a given inflow of immigrants, not in explaining its causes. For simplicity, in the
description, we omit time and country indexes.
There is a single final output good whose aggregate quantity is given by Y and whose price is
normalized to unity. The government redistributes income in two ways: through unemployment
benefits and through a lump-sum transfer, which can be interpreted to also include publicly provided
11

The assumption of a small open economy is stronger than needed. What is enough is that capital movements in
response to migration flows are small enough not to affect world interest rates.

8

private goods. Taxes are a constant fraction of wage income. Utility is linear in consumption.

4.1

Production

The final output good is produced using capital K and a composite input good Z. In turn, good Z
is produced using two intermediate inputs, YL and YH , which are linear functions of employment
of low skilled and high skilled workers, respectively, as in Acemoglu (2001). More precisely, the
supply side is characterized by the following set of expressions:12
= AK α Z 1−α , α ∈ (0, 1) ;

1
Z = xYLρ + (1 − x) YHρ ρ , ρ ∈ (0, 1) ;
X
Yi =
(1 − uij ) πij Qij , i ∈ {L, H} ,
Y

(1)

j∈{N,I}

where α is the output elasticity of capital, A denotes the total factor productivity, ρ governs the
elasticity of substitution between the low skill intensive good YL and the high skill intensive good
YH , x ∈ (0, 1) is a productivity parameter, Qij is the supply of different types of labor, with
i ∈ {L, H} indexing skills (high and low education) and j ∈ {N, I} distinguishing native (N ) and
immigrant (I) workers. Finally, uij is the unemployment rate and πij labor productivity for group
i × j. We assume that natives and migrants are perfect substitutes in production but we allow for
different effectiveness (productivity) between immigrants and natives in a skill group.13
We assume that capital is freely mobile internationally so that the return to capital is determined
on world markets. The stock of capital owned by natives is given by K̄. The optimal use of
capital in production can differ from K̄ and it is determined by the usual first order condition
r + δ = αAK α−1 Z 1−α where r + δ is the user cost of capital, given by the sum of the interest rate
on a risk-free asset and capital depreciation rate. Hence, gross capital income R generated in the
economy is given by:
R ≡ (r + δ)K = αAK α Z 1−α = αY.

(2)

Intermediate goods are produced under perfect competition. So, their price equals their marginal
contribution to the production of the final good Y , namely:

 1−α−ρ
ρ
,
pL = AK α (1 − α)xYLρ−1 xYLρ + (1 − x)YHρ
1−α−ρ


ρ
pH = AK α (1 − α)(1 − x)YHρ−1 xYLρ + (1 − x)YHρ
.

(3)
(4)

The production function of the intermediate goods is very simple: once a worker of group i × j
(i ∈ {L, H}, j ∈ {N, I}) has been hired he/she produces πij units of the intermediate good Yi .
12
13

A similar structure is used in Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014) and in Ottaviano and Peri (2012).
See the debate in Ottaviano and Peri (2012).

9

The labor market, however, is not competitive, and therefore equilibrium prices of the intermediate
goods are not equal to wages.

4.2

Labor Markets

There is a separate labor market for each type of worker (H and L) and supplies are given. Firms
post vacancies specific to a skill. Depending on the vacancies and unemployed in each market,
matches are formed in each period. Labor supply is taken as exogenous and natives and immigrants
of the same skill type compete for the same jobs. The total supply of workers in labor market i is
P
therefore given by Qi = j∈{N,I} Qij , i ∈ {H, L}. Immigration represents an exogenous change in
the number of foreign-born workers QiI .
Matching process.

Firms cannot distinguish between natives and immigrants when posting

vacancies. In other words, they cannot direct their search activities. So, while there are four types
of workers, there are only two labor markets (for high and low skilled workers). At each instant of
P
time, a mass Vi of open vacancies and a mass of Ui = j∈{N,I} Uij of unemployed workers exist
in each labor market i. We denote the mass of successful matches by M . For each market, we use
a standard constant returns to scale matching function that is increasing in both its arguments,
concave and homogenous of degree one:14
M (Ui , Vi ) = ξUiε Vi1−ε ,

i = H, L,

(5)

where ε ∈ (0, 1) is the matching elasticity and ξ is a scale parameter. Labor market tightness,
defined as θi ≡ Vi /Ui , is measured as the number of vacancies per unemployed person. The rate at
which the firms fill vacancies is Mi /Vi = q(θi ) = ξθ−ε . The rate at which the unemployed find jobs
is Mi /Ui = m(θi ) = ξθ1−ε . Market tightness makes it easier for an unemployed to find a job and
conversely harder for a firm to fill a vacancy. Existing matches are broken at the exogenous rate
sij , which may differ between natives and migrants as well as across skill types. Heterogeneity in
sij is one important determinant of the heterogeneity in wage rates and unemployment rates across
groups.
Bellman Equations. With these assumptions the Bellman (asset) equations governing the value
to a firm producing good i of an open vacancy JiV and of a filled job JijF are as follows:
rJiV
rJijF
14



F
F
= −ci + q(θi ) (1 − φi )JiN
+ φi JiI
− JiV ,


= πij pi − wij − sij JijF − JiV ,

(6)
(7)

Ljungqvist and Sargent (2005) also analyze the case in which there are separate matching functions by level of
unemployment benefits, or for both skills and benefits.

10

where ci is the flow cost of an open vacancy (denoted in terms of the numéraire good). The variable
φi ≡ UiI / (UiI + UiN ) denotes the share of immigrants among those searching for a job. The flow
value of an open vacancy, rJiV , has no index j, since firms cannot direct their search. Instead,
the term in brackets includes both the case that the job is filled by a native and the case that
the job is filled by an immigrant. An open vacancy is turned into a filled job with the rate q (θi ).
This generates a capital gain equal to the expected value of the filled job minus value of the open
vacancy. Similarly, the flow value of a filled job is equal to the flow return of a filled job (πij pi − wij )
minus the expected capital loss occurring if the match breaks (at rate sij ).
For workers, the Bellman equations governing the value of employment, JijE , and unemployment,
JijU , are as follows:
rJijU
rJijE



= g + bij + hij + m(θi ) JijE − JijU ,


= g + wij (1 − t) − sij JijE − JijU ,

(8)
(9)

where t is a proportional tax rate on labor, g is a lump-sum transfer, bij < πij pi the unemployment
benefit, and hij the non-monetary effect on utility of losing one’s job.15 Without loss of generality,
we normalize hij to zero for natives (hHN = hLN = 0). The value of hiI will be negative for
immigrants if they experience larger disutility from unemployment due to not being in their home
country. The flow value of unemployment is given by (bij + hij ) plus the capital gain arising from
a successful match, which occurs at rate m (θi ) . Similarly, the flow value of employment is the
net wage minus a capital loss arising from job destruction. Our assumption that hiI < 0 follows
Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014).
Wage bargaining.

Firms post vacancies until the value of posting a vacancy drops to zero.

The free entry condition JiV = 0 applies to vacancies in both skill classes. As it is customary
in the literature, we assume that wages are bargained once a match has been formed (and the
identity of the worker – native or immigrant – has been revealed). Let the bargaining power of
the worker be β ∈ (0,1) ; then, the worker receives the share β of the total surplus of the match

JijE + JijF − JijU − JiV . Incorporating the free entry condition, this implies

(1 − β) JijE − JijU = βJijF .

(10)

As usual in this type of models, we focus on the steady state, i.e. the situation where the flows
into and out of unemployment must be equal for each type of workers: sij (Qij − Uij ) = m(θi )Uij
15

One might argue that hij should be positive, as those losing a job have more time available for leisure. However, social
psychologist Jahoda (1981) highlights that employment provides several important non-monetary payoffs, including
social contacts beyond the family. Blanchflower and Oswald (2004) provide evidence on significant utility costs of
unemployment in the United States and in the United Kingdom, and Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1995) and

immigrants, non-monetary costs of unemployment would be bigger for immigrants.

where Eij is total employment in labor market cell i × j. As usual, tighter market leads to lower
equilibrium unemployment, and higher separation rates to more equilibrium unemployment.

Public sector

We consider a very simple budget constraint. The government collects income by proportional
taxation on labor. Capital is not taxed. The government uses its revenues to finance the payment
of unemployment benefits and the lump-sum transfer g.16 With these assumptions, the government
budget constraint is

The left-hand side of equation (12) corresponds to government expenditures, given by the sum

government revenues. We will treat bij and g as exogenous17 and let t adjust to satisfy (12).

This can be seen as a job-creation condition. It says that the expected cost of creating a vacancy
(the left-hand-side) must be equal to the expected per period operating profit from a job filled with
either a native or a migrant, πij pi − wij , discounted at the specific effective discount rate r + sij (the
right-hand-side). The job surplus to the firm can be high because the worker has high productivity
πij , because she is paid a low wage wij , or because she has a low separation rate sij . This points at
a key channel through which immigrants affect labor markets for natives. If they are paid a lower
16

It would be easy to introduce publicly provided private goods into our model. Assuming that the government provides
also a pure public good would increase the gains of immigration mechanically as the fixed costs would be divided
more widely. Therefore, our formulation provides conservative estimates on potential benefits of immigration. In our
data, regressing the log of public expenditures on the log of population size produces a coefficient of 1.03 (t statistic:
18.66; R squared: 0.95). This is consistent with our hypothesis that government expenditures can be expressed in
terms of per capita transfers, the role for pure public goods being limited.

We take replacement rates from the data and calculate unemployment benefits using replacement rates and wages.

wage than natives for the same productivity, an increase in their share φij increases the surplus
of the firm (right hand side) and in equilibrium it must increase job creation and labor market
tightness θi . This, in turn, decreases native unemployment and increases native wages.
Wage equations. Substituting the value functions (8) and (9) into (10), and recognizing that
the free entry condition implies JijF = (πij pi − wij ) / (r + sij ) from (7), one can express the wage
rate as a convex combination of the value product of a match, πij pi , and the outside option bij +hij :
wij = β

r + sij + m (θi )
r + sij
πij pi +(1 − β)
(bij + hij ) .
(r + sij ) [1 − t (1 − β)] + βm (θi )
(r + sij ) [1 − t (1 − β)] + βm (θi )
(14)

The lower is the bargaining power of the worker (β) the closer is the wage to the outside option.
If β = 0, wij = (bij + hij ) / (1 − t) which is exactly the outside option. As β approaches unity,
the worker’s income approaches the product of her labor πij pi and the outside option becomes
irrelevant. Moreover, the tighter is the market (as m(θi )0 > 0) the larger is the weight on πij pi as
workers have a stronger effective bargaining position.18 It is also straightforward to show that (for
a given equilibrium value of labor market tightness) higher separation rates are associated with
lower wages. This means that if we adjust the separation rates of two groups in such a way that
market tightness is unaffected, the group with higher separation rates is also going to have lower
equilibrium wages.
From (13) and (14), it is easy to see that heterogeneity between native and immigrant workers
in their productivity πij and in their separation rates sij have qualitatively similar effects. Lower
productivity of migrants and higher separation rates represent a downward shift of the job-creation
curve in wage-tightness space. Differences in the outside option hij shift the wage curves (14) in
similar qualitative fashion.
Definition of equilibrium.

The equations above define a set of ten equilibrium conditions: one

first-order condition governing the optimal capital stock (2), two profit maximizing conditions on
goods markets (3) and (4), the government budget constraint (12), two job-creation conditions (13)
for each skill category, and four wage equations (14). We use them to solve for ten equilibrium
objects: {K; pL , pH ; t; θL , θH ; wLN , wLI , wHN , wHI } . Knowing θi , one can immediately obtain Uij ,
Yij and φi from (11). Note that choosing the price of the final output good as the numéraire implies
a restriction on goods prices pL , pH which makes either (3) or (4) redundant (Walras’ Law).19
18

Note that utility obtained from public goods consumption drops out from (14).
That restriction arises from setting the price index dual to the production function system (1) equal to unity. I.e.,
ρ/(ρ−1) 1/(1−ρ)

Analytical results without public sector

The model we have outlined above captures several mechanisms through which natives’ outcomes
are affected by the characteristics and size of the immigrant population. Because of the complexity
of the model, it has to be analyzed numerically. Before proceeding to numerical analysis, this
subsection presents some analytical results for a simplified model without a public sector.
Remark 1. Let us abstract from a public sector so that g = bij = 0. Moreover, let us assume
that natives and immigrants are identical except for the outside options so that sij = si , πij = 1,
and hiI < 0. Then, the model implies that
(i) an inflow of immigrants with the same skilled-unskilled composition as natives increases wages
and decreases unemployment rates of natives, and therefore increases native welfare;
(ii) an inflow of immigrants of skill i will unambiguously benefit natives of skill i0 6= i. It may
benefit natives of skill i as well, but that depends on parameters;
(iii) a worsening of the outside option of immigrants increases wages, decreases unemployment
rates and increases welfare for natives.
Proof.

See the Appendix.

The result in (i) is intuitive. In a model where immigrants have worse outside option than natives
(as in Chassamboulli and Palivos, 2014) immigrants affect natives through skill complementarity
and through their effect on vacancy creation. The skill complementarity channel is inactive if we
assume that immigrants have the same skill distribution as natives. The job creation channel is
driven by the fact that immigrants’ lower outside option translates into a larger surplus for the
firm when a vacancy is filled by an immigrant. A higher share of immigrants encourages firms
to create more vacancies. The resulting tighter labor markets benefit natives by lowering their
unemployment rate and increasing their wages.
The intuition for (ii) is also straightforward: without a government, an inflow of immigrants of
skill i will affect natives of skill i0 6= i only through the factor complementarity channel, which is
unambiguously positive. On the other hand, our model cannot deliver sharp predictions concerning
the effect on natives of the same skill as immigrants. The reason is that there are two counteracting
effects at work: a factor competition effect (which is negative for natives) and a vacancy creation
effect (positive for natives). The latter will tend to dominate when natives have high unemployment
rates and when wage gaps between immigrants and natives are large.
The result in (iii) is driven by the same mechanism as (i): The surplus from the match that the
firm gets is a negative function of the outside option of the worker. And because vacancies cannot
be directed to immigrants or natives, the additional vacancies that firms post benefit natives as
well.
14

Remark 2. Let us abstract from a public sector so that g = bij = 0. Moreover, let us assume
that natives and immigrants are identical except for separation rates so that hiI = 0, πij = 1, and
siI > siN . Then, the model implies that
(i) an inflow of immigrants with the same skilled-unskilled composition as natives decreases wages
and increases unemployment rates of all natives, and therefore decreases native welfare;
(ii) an inflow of immigrants of skill i will unambiguously reduce the welfare of natives of skill i,
and may have either positive or negative effect on natives of skill i0 6= i;
(iii) an increase in the separation rates for immigrants affects negatively welfare of all natives,
through both wages and unemployment rates.
Proof.

In the text; also see the Appendix for further discussion.

The intuition for the result in (i) above is the same (in the opposite direction) as the intuition
for result (i) of Remark 1. The only effect of a balanced immigrant inflow is through the vacancy
creation effect, which is negative in this case: more immigrants mean that the firm’s expected
surplus from a match is lower. This reduces the number of posted vacancies, and market tightness
adjusts, putting downward pressure on wages and upward pressure on unemployment of natives.
The first part of the result in (ii) is a joint effect of negative factor competition effect and negative
vacancy creation effect. The effect on natives of the other skill type is indeterminate and depends
on whether the inflow of immigrants of the other type results in an increase or in a decrease in the
number of filled jobs of that type. Result (iii) follows the same intuition: if immigrants have higher
separation rates, expected surplus will be lower and welfare will be lower for workers of the same
skill class. Through production complementarity, there will also be a spillover effect for natives of
a different skill.
The two remarks above illustrate the mechanisms at work in the labor markets of our model
and emphasize the importance of immigrants’ outside option and separation rates in determining
their impact on natives. We will next simulate welfare effects for the countries in our sample using
the full-fledged model and employing country-level moments for calibration.

Quantitative Analysis

We parameterize the described model for each of the 20 countries in our data set. Our main object
of interest is per capita group-specific welfare Wij . It equals the sum of average earned after-tax
income, multiplied by the probability of being employed, the sum of the unemployment benefit and
the non-monetary effect on utility of losing one’s job, hij , multiplied be the probability of being
unemployed, income accruing to the average capital stock kij owned by members of the group ij, as
well as lump-sum transfer g (or, equivalently for our purposes, a publicly provided private good):
15

Wij = (1 − Uij )(1 − t)wij + Uij (bij + hij ) + rkij + g.

(15)

We are also interested in utilitarian overall native or immigrant (per capita) welfare, which we
P Q
obtain averaging across skill categories as follows: Wj = i P ij
Qij Wij .
i

5.1

Calibration

External parameters.

To prepare the calibration we tie model parameters to observable data.

First, we set unemployment benefits bij equal to the net wage wij (1 − t) times the observable
country-specific replacement rate %, i.e. bij = %wij (1 − t). Second, we assume that all capital used in the status quo equilibrium is native owned, so that K̄ = K, and we pin down
that value by using information on the user cost, and the observable capital share α in GDP.
GDP is denoted by Y so that, K̄ = αY / (r + δ).

Third, we normalize cL to a constant.20

This leaves us with a total of 26 exogenous parameters which we need to determine using data
{Qij , sij , πij , hiI , %, cH , ξ, A, x, G, β, ε, ρ, r, δ, α} , with i ∈ {H, L} and j ∈ {N, I} .
There are two types of parameters in the model. Some of them can be directly equated to
their empirically observable counterparts or can be taken from the literature. Other parameters
are obtained by matching a set of moments. Moreover, while most model parameters vary across
countries, some are assumed to be fixed.
Table 2 below lists model parameters that we take from the empirical literature or can observe
directly in standard data bases. We follow Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) and most of the related
literature in setting the bargaining power of workers β equal to the elasticity of the matching
function, ε, ensuring that the Hosios condition is met. The parameter ρ governing the elasticity
of substitution between the high skill intensive and the low skill intensive good, is set, in line with
Ottaviano and Peri (2012), at ρ = 0.5, which corresponds to an elasticity of 2. The user cost of
capital (r + δ) is about 12% per year, or about 1% per month following Chassamboulli and Palivos
(2014) and similar to other papers in the literature. The above mentioned parameters do not vary
across the 20 countries considered, due to data limitations.
Table 2 also presents exogenous parameters that we take from the data and which vary across
countries. We have country-specific information on average replacement rates % from the OECD
Benefits and Wages data base. We also allow the capital shares α, to vary across countries and
we take those from OECD data. Finally, we use observed data on immigrant stocks Qij as we
have information on immigrants as percentage of labor force in each skill group. Without loss of
P
generality, we normalized the native labor force of a country to 1 such that i QiN = 1.21
20
21

We checked that it is just a normalization by changing the value of cL and verified that results are unaffected.
We construct the four population shares from the immigrant share, the skill composition of natives and of immigrants,
and this normalization.

Calibration of unobserved model parameters. We pin down the remaining parameters of
the model such that the baseline equilibrium of our model reproduces a number of moments that
we observe for our 20 OECD economies. Table 3 shows the 11 empirical moments that are available
for our analysis. Since there are 15 parameters left to determine ({sij , πij , hiI , cH , ξ, A, x, G}) , we
face an identification problem.
We solve the issue by setting πij = 1. The rationale for this specific choice is twofold. First,
given the structure of the moments that we want to match, we want to maintain a basic trade-off
in the model, namely that the presence of immigrant can encourage or discourage job creation.
The first case occurs with hiI < 0 (as in Chassamboulli and Palivos, 2014); the second happens if
siI > siN or if πiI < πiN . So, we want to maintain flexibility on hiI . Moreover, while sij and πij
affect the value of a filled vacancy in a similar way, allowing variation in sij has the advantage that
it affects both wages and unemployment rates. Second, empirical results by LaLonde and Topel
(1991), Borjas and Friedberg (2009), and Kerr and Kerr (2011) show that immigrants are paid less
than natives after controlling for observable productivity drivers such as education and language.22
With this restriction, we calibrate the remaining 11 parameters of the model so that our model
exactly reproduces the set of moments, country by country, as summarized by Table 4. The
moments mostly have country variation and have been discussed in Section 2 above. Note that the
standard deviations reported in the table refer to variation across countries.
22

Note that, even with πij = 1, different skills command different productivities due to the parameter x included in
equation (1). In Section 5.2.3, we conduct a sensitivity analysis that identifies those countries for which failure of our
identifying assumption is most problematic.

All shares refer to working age population, aged 15-64.
All the moments above are constructed for each of our 20 countries.

Driven by unemployment rate differences, we calibrate separation rates to be larger for immigrants than for natives.

The gap is particularly large for low skilled (2 percentage points on

average) reflecting the significantly higher unemployment rate of low skilled immigrants. For high
skilled the difference is only 1%. The parameters hLI and hHI are mostly negative capturing the
worse options (lower utility arising from a loss of social networks) of immigrants when unemployed.
This is revealed by the lower equilibrium wage of immigrants. Three exceptions are high skilled
immigrants in Australia, Switzerland and the US, for which the values of hHI are positive. Using
the calibrated parameters of table 4, in the next sections we will perform some exercises of comparative static analysis using, as reference, the current situation and identifying marginal changes
in the share of immigrants. Then we will move to simulate the welfare effects of more substantial
changes in immigration comparing the current situation with counter-factual scenarios, in each of
our 20 countries.

5.2

Results

In our simulations we focus primarily on the welfare effects of immigrants on native workers who
make up the relevant political constituency for migration policy. However, we also present some
effects on previous immigrants. We report results for the 20 countries in our sample on three
simulation scenarios that either take an ex ante perspective (effects of a marginal increase of immigration, starting from the current situation) or an ex post perspective (effects of recent or total
migration).

5.2.1

Welfare Effects of a Marginal Increase in Immigration

We start by simulating the welfare effects of increasing the immigrant stock so that its share of the
labor force increases by one percentage point, leaving its relative skill composition unchanged. We
use this scenario to provide insights on the different mechanisms present in our model. In particular,
in five steps, we gradually add all features of our framework. This incremental procedure illustrates
the relative role of each model “ingredient” in shaping the effects on native welfare.23 To save space,
Table 5 provides results for two countries only, the US and Germany, in each of the increasingly
rich models. We report welfare effects on natives and immigrants in all countries for the complete
model in Table 6.24
Table 5 starts with Model 1, in which all effects derive exclusively from classical complementarity
channel between immigrants and natives. By setting hij = 0; siI = siN ; bij = 0; g = 0, we eliminate
the effects of any labor market heterogeneity and of the public sector. This setup relates to more
traditional models such as Borjas (2003), Ottaviano and Peri (2012), or Docquier et al. (2014),
in which only the different skill composition of immigrants, and elasticity of substitution, affect
wages.25 We find that overall welfare effects on natives WN are positive but very close to zero both
in Germany and the US. However, effects on specific skill groups are more pronounced. High-skilled
natives in Germany see a 0.11% increase in their welfare, while low skilled lose 0.05%. In the US,
high skilled individuals lose −0.02%, while low-skilled individuals gain 0.01%. This pattern reflects
the fact that, in the US, immigration drives up the relative supply of skilled workers, reducing their
wages (and, thus, welfare), while, in Germany, the opposite happens.
Model 2 accounts for observed immigrant-native wage differences by allowing for differences in
23

We assume that capital stocks adjust endogenously in all models.
Table B.2 at the end of our Appendix provides full country coverage on the stripped-down model variants.

These models do not feature search frictions on the labor market; Model 1 does.

the outside option of immigrants and natives (i.e., hiI 6= 0). This model is similar to Chassamboulli
and Palivos 2014, and adds the job creation effect of immigrants described in Remark 1 above. In
both the US and Germany, this channel adds incentives to create jobs and lowers unemployment. In
this case, average native welfare goes up by 0.07% in Germany and by 0.04% in the US. Moreover,
in both countries, both skill groups gain from immigration. In the complete country sample (Table
B.2 in the Appendix), 14 out of 20 countries experience gains for both skill groups when accounting
for this channel. In the remaining six cases a distributive conflict remains. In these countries,
the skill composition of migrants is heavily biased towards high skilled for which the job creation
channel is relatively unimportant.
Model 3 matches heterogeneity in native-immigrants unemployment rates by allowing separation
rates to differ (i.e., siI 6= siN ). Matches with migrants have a shorter expected duration, so that the
vacancy creation effect is weakened. Moreover, the strength of the complementarity channel may be
weakened, too. Interestingly, this generalization has a very small effect in the US, while it cuts the
total immigration surplus to less than a third in Germany. The reason lies in the high unemployment
rates amongst German immigrants relative to natives, while native-immigrants unemployment rates
are almost identical in the US.
Finally, Model 4 adds tax-financed unemployment benefits (bij > 0) and Model 5, the most
comprehensive variant, also includes general redistribution (g > 0). Both in Germany and in the US,
unemployment benefits generate relatively little redistribution and do not alter welfare implications
by much.26 Introducing other public expenditures matters much more, especially in Germany, where
it turns the overall native welfare effect to slightly negative by especially reducing college educated
surplus. In the US, public transfers are comparably less relevant and their introduction has no
major effect on native welfare gains.
Table 6 shows welfare effects for all countries for the full model (Model 5). Natives in most countries benefit from a one-percentage-point increase in immigrant share of the level force at current
(2011) skill composition. However, in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Sweden and Switzerland native welfare falls. In all these cases, welfare gains turn negative due to
26

In the larger country sample, this is a robust finding (see Table B.2 in the Appendix).

the redistribution, so that general redistribution plays a bigger role than unemployment benefits.
Countries with initially high unemployment rates of natives (Italy, Greece, Portugal) are among
those benefiting most form the job-creating channel. In all countries, welfare effects – whether positive or negative – are relatively small, ranging between -0.04% (Switzerland) to +0.07% (Portugal),
and averaging 0.02%.
Table 6 also shows that, across most countries, previous immigrants benefit from additional immigration. This is mostly because they benefit strongly from the vacancy creation effect but do not
suffer from increased redistribution as their incomes are lower than natives’. The vacancy creation
effect in a non-Walrasian market can therefore turn the conventional wisdom upside down: existing
immigrants, even if potentially competing with new immigrants may actually gain from immigration
rather than being the group losing the most. Note that positive welfare gains accruing to previous
immigrants makes the welfare gains available to natives smaller; see Felbermayr and Kohler (2007).

Gains from Realized Immigration

In this section, we report the welfare effects of realized immigration as of 2011 (i) relative to a
hypothetical ‘closed border’ situation, in which countries are assumed to have no foreign-born
workers at all, and (ii) relative to the situation as in year 2000. Table 7 presents the results.

Countries

We construct immigrant shares and skill composition from OECD data. See Appendix B for details.

Countries featuring positive marginal effects in Table 6, such as Italy, Portugal, Greece and
Ireland, are also among those that gain the most from total immigration. A high unemployment
rate of natives (especially among the low skilled) and large immigrant wage gaps lead to strong
beneficial job-creation effects. Moreover, the job creation effect takes a non-linear form: we find a
positive overall effects for 19 out of our 20 countries while only 13 countries had positive marginal
effects. The magnitudes of the welfare effects of total immigration vary strongly across countries,
reflecting the heterogeneity reported in Section 3. In our sample, both the median and the average
welfare gains are close to 1%.
22

As to the distributional effects of immigration, we find that, in 14 out of 20 countries, there is
no distributive conflict amongst natives. This highlights the importance of the job-creation effect,
which can be positive for both groups, over the simple complementarity effect, which is always
positive for one and negative for the other group. Australia, Canada and Switzerland, whose
immigrant composition is most skewed in favor of highly skilled, are the only countries showing
negative effects on the welfare of high skilled natives. Germany, Slovenia and the United Kingdom
exhibit negative (but very small) effect on welfare of the low skilled.
The comparison of the status quo with a ‘closed border’ situation reveals the total welfare
gains from international mobility. More informative for the current policy debate are the gains
from immigration inflows from recent migration flows (from 2001 to 2011). All of the considered
countries have seen the immigrant share in the work force increase quite substantially in that period.
Not shown in the table, countries differ strongly as to the skill composition of recent immigration.
Most countries experienced an increase in the share of high skilled among immigrants. However
the opposite is true for a few countries, including Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom.
Our simulations find that sixteen countries out of twenty experienced positive effects for the
aggregate native welfare, and in five of these countries both low skilled and high skilled natives
benefitted. Overall, because migration has been relatively skilled in the considered countries and
because fiscal transfers have redistributed gains in favor of less skilled, low skilled have benefited
in 16 out of 20 cases. On average they experienced a welfare increase of 0.33 percent, while high
skilled natives have not benefitted. Note that the positive effects for the low skilled, the very
low effects for the high skilled, and the small positive effects on welfare are consistent with the
findings of Docquier et al. (2014).27 Overall the simulations of the welfare effects of immigration
during the last 10 years show on average a positive effect on per capita income (after-tax earned
income and transfers) for natives. In all countries, a substantial part of these gains derived from
lower unemployment amongst low skilled natives. The model attributes to immigration an average
unemployment rate decrease by 0.47 percentage points. High skilled unemployment also fell in 15
out of 20 countries because of immigration (on average by 0.38 percentage points).
5.2.3

Robustness Check: Immigrant-Native Productivity Gaps within Skill-Groups

In the preceding analysis, we have solved the identification issue by assuming no productivity
differences between immigrants and natives of the same skill level, i.e. by setting πij = 1. In
this robustness check, we introduce a parameter η ∈ (0, 1) which makes the immigrant-native
productivity gap proportional to the observed wage gap between immigrants and natives.28 Setting
27

Those authors simulate the labor market effects of immigrants in a model featuring competitive labor markets. They
focus on net immigration between 1990-2000 into OECD countries. Their study neither features the job creation nor
the income redistribution effects, but it allows for potentially positive externalities from the high to the low skilled.
28
I.e., we posit πiN /πiI − 1 = η (wiN /wiI − 1) .

23

πiN = 1, this implies that πiI = [η (wiN /wiI − 1) + 1]−1 ≤ 1. In the absence of a wage gap (i.e.,
wiN = wiI ) or with η = 0, one has πiI = 1 (as assumed in our default specification). At the other
extreme, with η = 1, the entire wage gap is explained by a productivity gap.
Research by LaLonde and Topel (1991), Borjas and Friedberg (2009), and Kerr and Kerr (2011)
suggests that a substantial immigrant-native wage gap persists even after controlling for the portability of human capital. Hence, it is plausible to assume that η lies closer to 0 than to 1.

Note: The Figure shows that value of η (the share of the within-group wage difference explained by
productivity differences) at which the overall native welfare gain resulting from the total observed stock of
immigrants changes sign; the reference scenario being displayed in the second column of Table 7.

Figure 1 plots that level of η, for which the overall native welfare gain due to immigrants, as
shown in the second column of Table 7 for the case η = 0, changes sign. For example, in Canada,
immigration would be beneficial for natives even if almost all of the wage gap is due to productivity
differences (within skill groups) between natives and migrants. In contrast, in Germany or Sweden,
the gain would already turn negative with an η larger than 0.13 or 0.20, respectively. We may
conclude that our assumption πij = 1 may be problematic for countries at the lower end of Figure
24

1, while it is less of an issue for countries in the upper regions. Clearly, the Figure illustrates the
need for further empirical research on the origin of immigrant-native wage differentials.

5.3

Welfare effects and Country Characteristics: A linear decomposition

Our simulations show that the effects of immigration on native welfare depend in complicated ways
on the labor markets characteristics, the composition of the immigrant inflow and on redistributive
institutions in the host countries. We use a parsimonious regression analysis based on Monte Carlo
type simulations to investigate how native welfare gains depend on measurable initial moments of
country-specific variables.
We first create a sample of 10,000 artificial economies, each described by a 15-dimensional vector
of characteristics (initial labor force shares of natives and migrants, wage gaps, unemployment rates,
GDPs, government shares, etc.).29 We draw these ‘moments’ from a jointly distributed normal
distribution N (µ, Σ), where µ is a (15-dimensional) vector of means and Σ is the corresponding
variance-covariance matrix, both generated from our sample of 20 OECD countries.30
In the next step, we calibrate the model parameters of the artificial economies such that they
match the drawn characteristics, following the same procedure as in the sections above. We then
simulate the effects of a one percentage point increase in the labor force share of immigrants for
our artificial countries. This exercise creates observations on 10,000 economies which feature the
same joint distribution of the average moments of the 15 relevant variables as the 20 real OECD
economies that we do observe.
With these data we run a simple OLS regression (for all natives, and then separately by skill)
where welfare gains for natives as a dependent variable are regressed on country characteristics of
our simulated data (these are simple transformations of the 15 random variables). More precisely,
we run a semi-log ‘moment regression’:
∆ ln WiN =

X

βk ln Xik + ui

(16)

k=1,...,K

where ∆ ln WiN denotes the proportional welfare gain for natives in economy i, Xik is an i × K
matrix of country characteristics and ui is an error term that captures specification error.31 To
facilitate the quantitative comparison of effects, Table 8 presents standardized beta coefficients
from regression (16).32 It also shows the associated t-statistics (in square brackets). The estimates
should be interpreted as a way of summarizing the conditional correlation of a certain country
characteristic with the native welfare effect of immigration in a linear coefficient. Thus, regression
29

The country moments are those listed in the lower half of Table 2 and the nine moments that vary across countries
in Table 3 (job duration has no country variation). This gives us a total of 15 moments.
30
We truncate the distribution at µk ± 2σk to avoid meaningless realizations.
31
The theoretical model is highly non-linear; the investigation device (16), however, is approximately log-linear.
32
Standardized beta coefficients measure the impact of an independent variable on the dependent variable in units of
standard deviations, i.e., β̂k σ (ln Xk ) /σ (∆ ln WN ) .

(16) is a way of obtaining quantitative comparative statics results and by no means a test of the
model.
Column (1) of table 8 shows that the native/immigrant wage gaps turn out to be the most
important positive determinants of the overall native welfare gains from immigration. Increasing
the high skilled and the low skilled wage gaps by one standard deviation leads to an increase in
the welfare gains by 0.09 and 0.1 standard deviations, respectively. This result shows the strength
of the job-creation effect discussed above. The second most important positive driver is the skill
ratio between natives and immigrants: relatively highly educated immigrants are associated with
larger gains.33 The replacement rate ranks third: a higher replacement rate increases the gains as
immigrants’ job-creating effects are stronger if labor market frictions are initially more pronounced.
This effect dwarfs the negative redistributive role of replacement rates.
The pre-existing share of immigrants in the labor force turns out to be the most important neg33

ative determinant of the welfare gains (standardized beta of -0.15). This suggests that there may be
a level of the share of immigrants at which the (usually) positive welfare effects of immigrants estimated in the previous section may turn negative. The logic for this result relates to infra-marginal
effects: if additional immigration raises the wages of incumbent migrants, firms’ incentives to create jobs fall and the value of immigration for immigrants is diminished; see Felbermayr and Kohler
(2007). Immigrant/native unemployment gaps also reduce the welfare gains of immigration, as
expected. The role of general redistribution ranks only as the third most important negative determinant (standardized beta of -0.06).
Looking at the welfare gains of low skilled (column (2)) or high skilled natives (column (3)),
a similar picture emerges. However, the relative skill composition of immigrants is the dominant
determinant of welfare gains: the larger the share of immigrants with tertiary education, the
higher the welfare gains for the low skilled and the smaller the gains for the high skilled. The
associated standardized betas are quite substantial: 0.18 and -0.35, respectively. This shows that
the classical complementarity/substitution channel is still important for quantifying the distributive
consequences of migration, but matters much less for overall native welfare gains. Native wage gaps
with immigrants still augment the welfare gains, and the strength of labor market imperfections
(as measured by the replacement rate) matters more for low skilled than for high skilled natives.

Conclusions

The impact of immigration on wages, employment and welfare of natives depends on the characteristics of immigrants and on the institutions of the host country. The research on the economic
effects of immigration, however, has often implicitly assumed market clearing in perfectly competitive labor markets, and no government in charge of redistribution or unemployment insurance. In
this paper, we propose a model that addresses these two issues. We start by showing that, in most
countries, immigrants earn lower wages than natives and face higher unemployment risk, holding
observable skills constant. However, there is substantial heterogeneity across countries, both with
regard to immigrants’ relative labor market performance, and with regard to institutional features
or the size and skill composition of the immigrant stock.
We develop a model that is sufficiently flexible to capture these facts. We use a standard
search-and-matching model where firms cannot discriminate between immigrants and natives ex
ante. However, when a match is formed, wage bargaining accounts for immigrants’ lower outside
options and lower expected match duration. These two ingredients imply that a higher share of
immigrants can either encourage or discourage vacancy creation by firms, with obvious consequences
for wages and tightness in the labor markets for both low and high skilled workers.
We also add a redistributive government to the model. As stressed in the public finance literature, migration may increase redistribution that can hurt natives who typically hold better paying
jobs and are less likely to be unemployed. Our model accounts for that. Indeed, time and again,
27

surveys show that unemployment and fiscal transfers are the most important determinants of overall
attitudes towards migration by natives (Boeri, 2010).34
Introducing random-search frictions into a model featuring skill complementarity has quantitatively important implications on the effects of immigration on the welfare of natives. First, when
foreign workers have worse outside option than natives, immigration boosts firms’ incentives to
create vacancies; this benefits all workers (natives and incumbent immigrants) and increases the
immigration surplus. Part of this advantage is eroded by the fact that matches with immigrants
typically have shorter duration. However, our quantitative exercise suggests that the net effect
from both channels is positive in virtually all countries of our sample, and sometimes substantial.
Interestingly, this job-creation effect seem more important in countries where domestic labor
market institutions are more conducive to native unemployment. In total, the benefits from immigration deriving from labor market imperfections are quantitatively more important than the
classical complementarity/substitution channel or even than redistribution.
Third, in the presence of search frictions and wage bargaining, it is likely that, due to the forces
described above, immigration does not create a distribution conflict between high and low skilled
natives as in the classical model. Nonetheless, the composition of the immigrant work force relative
to natives is still the main predictor of skill-specific native welfare effects.
Fourth, the presence of a redistributive welfare state makes immigration less attractive to natives. It turns a positive aggregate gain into a negative one in 6 out of 20 countries. However, in
most of these countries, the conditional quantitative relevance of high immigrant unemployment is
more important than redistribution.
Finally, accounting for all channels through which immigration affects natives, the latter are
better off with the current migration stocks than in a hypothetical situation of ”closed borders”
in 19 out of 20 countries. Averaging across all countries in our sample, the gains of high skilled
natives from open borders amounts to 1.25% while that of low skilled natives is 1.00%.
Our “macro” approach based on the structural calibration of a model on detailed data from
several countries complements previous reduced-form one-country analyses of the effects of immigration. Still, there are many ways in which our analysis could be extended. For example,
accounting for population dynamics and life-cycle aspects would be an important extension. We
hope further research will continue to combine micro and macro approaches to answer the policy
relevant questions about the economic impact of immigrants.

34

In contrast, the same data from the European Social Survey indicate that the wage effects of immigration are relatively
unimportant, despite their prominent role in the economic literature.

Analytics of Simplified Models

A.1

Remark 1

Before we can discuss this specific result, we need to derive a few equations, which are simplifications
of the model we presented above. Assuming that separation rates are the same for immigrants and
natives, the ratio of natives and immigrants among employed and unemployed is the same as their
ratio in the labor force: immigrants and natives have the same chance of getting matched with a
firm (because of ex ante non-identifiability) and have the same probability of transitioning from
employment to unemployment (because they have the same split rates). Hence φi , introduced in
equation (6) is equal to QiI /(QiI + QiN ) in this case, i.e. the share of immigrants in the labor force.
The ratio YH /YL that determines the marginal productivity of each type of workers can then be
written as:

YH
m(θH ) [sL + m(θL )] QHN + QHI
=
∗
YL
m(θL ) [sH + m(θH )] QLN + QLI

(17)

Also in equilibrium the vacancy/employment ratio is si /q(θi ). Substituting (17) into (3) and (4),
we can write the two equilibrium conditions that determine the equilibrium market tightness θH
and θL explicitly.

When the inflow of immigrants is balanced (the ratio to low to high skilled is the same as in

the original native population) it is not going to affect Ω and since immigrants of each type are as
productive as natives, there is also no effect through Λ(θH , θL ). The left hand side of equation (18)
29

remains the same. The right hand side of the same equation will need to adjust to the increase in
φL (we look at low skilled first). Since this change has no first order impact on the left-hand side
of equation (18) we can write the partial derivative of θL with respect to φL for the right-hand side
of equation (18)

(23)

This confirms the intuition that as the number of immigrants increases without changing the ratio
between high skilled and low skilled workers, the value of a vacancy goes up, due to the fact that
immigrants leave a higher surplus to the firm. Since we have a free entry condition that ensures
that the equilibrium value of a vacancy remains zero, more vacancies will be created compared
to the total number of workers, thereby increasing market tightness in both markets. As market
tightness decreases in both markets, unemployment rates for natives will also decrease, since
UiN =

si
QiN for i = H, L
si + m(θi )

(24)

In this equation, the arrival of new immigrants will only affect the unemployment rate through
θi . As θi increases, m(θi ) also increases (the probability to find a job is higher the higher market
tightness is), which negatively affects the unemployment rate of natives. Evaluating the effects
on equilibrium wages is only slightly more complicated. We use our wage bargaining equation,
observing that the match surplus will be a positive function of market tightness, i.e.

∂pi

are interested in the effect of a change in market tightness on wages of natives:

∂wiN
= βpi
∂θi
[(r + si ) (1 − t (1 − β)) + βm (θi )]2

30

(25)

After a few simple steps, this simplifies to

Therefore

∂wiN
= βm0 (θi )[(1 − β)(r + si )pi (1 − t)]
∂θi

(26)

∂wiN
> 0 if and only if pi (1 − t) > 0
∂θi

(27)

which is not an additional condition since we needed to assume this from the start to avoid corner
solutions in which all workers are unemployed.
(ii)

A change in the outside option of immigrants affects labor market tightness through the same

channel discussed above, namely vacancy creation effects. If the outside option for immigrants
worsens, unemployment of natives falls and wages of natives increase.
In particular, consider a decrease in hiI (i.e. an increase in its absolute value). Note that hiI
only enters equations (18) and (19) when it is multiplied by φi . Therefore the effect of a change in
hiI is analytically equivalent to a change in φi : having more immigrants or changing the outside
option of current immigrant has the same qualitative effects. Therefore, the effects of labor market
tightness on unemployment rates and wages of natives are equivalent to the analysis above. Just
for clarity in the exposition, let us consider an inflow of less skilled immigrants, focusing on the
effects on high skilled natives. An increase in QLI will affect Ω in equation (19). By reducing
the relative size of the high skilled population, it will increase market tightness in the high skilled
market. From equation (19) we can then look at the effect of an increase in θH on pH :
βξ 2

(1 − ) θ2 (1 − β)(1 − t) + [(r + sH )(1 − t(1 − β)) +
∂pH
H

[ξθH

(28)

so that higher labor market tightness is associated with a larger equilibrium surplus from the match,
lower unemployment rates and higher wages for high skilled natives.
(iii)

As discussed in the main text, the effect on natives of skill i0 6= i is entirely driven by

complementarity channel, which is always positive from the concavity of the production function,
as in (Borjas, 1995).

A.2

Remark 2

Results (i) and (ii) operate through identical mechanisms as in the case of remark 1, with the fundamental difference that the effect of larger migration stocks is now negative, rather then positive,
for the expected surplus from a match. Given this equivalence, we focus here on (iii).
For simplicity, consider a situation where immigrants and natives have identical separation rates

31

initially. We then increase split rates of immigrants of one type and look at the effects for natives (of
either type). Naturally, the direct stronger effects will be on the immigrant themselves. However,
our focus here is primarily on natives, which means that we are focusing on the indirect effect of
separation rates, which operates through the job creation margin.
In this paragraph we discuss effects on natives of the same skill level, while on the next paragraph
we discuss effects on natives of a different skill level. If immigrants have higher separation rates
than natives, this means that the surplus from being matched with an immigrant is lower, because
the match lasts shorter on average. Therefore, from the free entry condition


F

rJiV = −ci + q(θi ) (1 − φi )JiN
+ φi JiI
− JiV = 0

(29)

bearing in mind that we are ruling out that the firm can target natives or immigrants when it
creates a vacancy, we see that as the value of a filled vacancy falls, equilibrium market tightness
will have to fall in order for the equality to hold. Intuitively, in order for firms to break even in
an environment where they get a lower surplus from the match, the market will have to adjust so
that the probability of filling a vacancy will be larger for firms. In other words, at higher levels of
separation rates for immigrants, less vacancies get created so that equilibrium market tightness is
lower.
The rest of the discussion in this paragraph follows from the results on labor market tightness, which is the channel through which separation rates of immigrants affect labour markets of
natives.35 Below, we discuss the effects on wages and unemployment rates. These are generated
by difference in separation rates, but since they operate though labor market tightness, they have
been previously looked at in the context of search models. Higher separation rates for immigrants,
which bring about lower equilibrium labor market tightness, generate larger unemployment rates
for natives. Unemployment rates for natives of skill i are
uiN =

siN

siN
+ m(θi )

(30)

since m(θi ) is increasing in θi (in our model we use the functional form m(θi ) = ξθ1−ε ), the
unemployment rate of natives will be higher the lower is equilibrium market tightness, even though
separation rates of natives are unchanged.
We next discuss the effect of separation rates of immigrants on wages of natives, operating once
again through market tightness. Let us write gross wages of natives as a function only of market
35

We are abstracting from the fiscal channel here, which adds a further mechanism: if immigrants have larger separation
rates, they will have larger equilibrium unemployment rates, which imply larger transfers from natives even in the
absence of wage gaps.

32

tightness and exogenous parameters again:
wiN = β

r + siN + ξθ1−ε
pi
(r + siN ) (1 − t (1 − β)) + βξθ1−ε

We want to investigate the sign of

∂wiN
∂θi .

(31)

It is straightforward to see that the term on the

right-hand side of equation 31) is increasing in θi . The price pi = pi (θi ) is a positive function of
1−ε

iN +ξθ
labor market tightness, and it is easy to show that the expression β (r+siN r+s
is also a
)(1−t(1−β))+βξθ 1−ε

positive function of θi . Therefore, an increase in the separation rates of immigrants, reducing labor
market tightness, also lowers wages for natives.
Within a wage bargaining framework, wages are a convex combination of the surplus from the
match and the outside option of the worker. Lower labor market tightness lowers also the value of
the outside option to the worker (because it is harder to find a job when unemployed), the price of
the intermediate good is lower, and its weight is also lower (because the expected value of a match
following the current match is lower).
Summarizing, through its negative effects on labor market tightness, higher separation rates
for immigrants result in higher unemployment rates and lower wages, for immigrants but also for
natives of the same skill class. These dynamics will also have second-order spillover effects of the
same sign on native workers of a different skill class. This effect operates through equations 3 and
4, governing prices of the intermediate goods. A lower employment for one skill level corresponds
to a lower price in the other sector, due to complementarities. The mechanism feeds on itself and
moves the system along a saddle path to a new steady state. Therefore, our model predicts that
larger separation rates for immigrants in one sector will lower wages and increase unemployment
of natives of the same skill level and also of natives of a different skill level (although this indirect
effect is likely to be small).

B

Data Sources

The calibration of our model requires us to have different types of information, in particular concerning population shares (skill shares of the labor force in each country, percentage of foreign-born
individuals in each country, skill shares among immigrants), wages (skill premia and immigrant
wage gaps by skill level), unemployment rates for each skill, generosity of the unemployment insurance scheme, GDP per capita and size of the public sector. For each of these, we list our data sources
below. Following Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014) and Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull, and Violante
(2000), we define skilled workers as those workers who hold a Bachelor degree (or equivalent) or
above.
Population shares For all of the EU countries in our analysis, we have used information on
population shares from the 2012 Eurostat Yearbook (data for 2011), restricting our sample to
33

individuals between 15 and 64 years of age with skill information derived from the ISCED education
classification system. From the Eurostat Yearbook we use data on the share of low skilled among
natives, the share of low skilled among immigrants and the share of foreign born in the population.
For the US, equivalent population shares are constructed using the Public Use Micro File dataset
from the 2005 US Census. Similarly, for Canada we construct population shares using the Micro
File version of the 2006 Canadian Census. For Australia, we use the 2009 wave of the panel dataset
Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) representative survey.36 For the
US, Canada and Australia we do the equivalent sample restrictions that we described above for EU
countries.
Unemployment Rates In the descriptive section of our paper we present figures for unemployment rates by skill class and by immigration status. Although this is a basic statistics we were
not able to find this summary information for a large number of countries and using high-quality
data, so we had to use a few data sources to generate these statistics. For all EU countries and
Switzerland we have used descriptive data from the EU labor Force Survey. For Germany, there
no information on country of birth in the European Labor Force Survey so we had to use nationality instead, for years 2005-2011. For the United States, we used the Current Population
Survey for years 2005-2012. For Canada, since the Labor Force Survey (LFS) does not include
migration information, we constructed unemployment rates by skill level for 2005-2012, and then
used the 2006 Census Microfiles to construct unemployment rates for immigrants and natives. We
then constructed trends using the census data and the LFS data together. For Australia, we use
data from the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey from 2005
to 2011 (Waves 5-11). For wage gaps and unemployment rates, we average data over this period
to maximize comparability across countries and minimize the role of business cycle and short term
fluctuations, given that the focus of our study is on steady state comparisons.
Wages

For EU countries, we constructed a measure of the wage gap between low skilled and

high skilled native workers (i.e. the skill premium), and of the gaps between immigrant and native
workers (for low skilled and high skilled workers) using the European Union Statistics on Income
and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for years 2005-2011 (2010 for Ireland).37 For the US, Canada
and Australia we construct wage gaps based on the three datasets we just described.
Government Expenditures

Our data source for government expenditures is the variable ”Gen-

eral government total expenditure” as percentage of GDP from the World Economic Outlook
Database of the International Monetary Fund. For each country, we take an average for 2005-2012
36

We thank Robert Breunig for providing us with the statistics we needed from the HILDA survey. More information
on the survey is available in Wooden and Watson (2007) and Salehin and Breunig (2012).
37
We thank Eurostat for providing us with summary statistics based on the EU-SILC dataset.

34

to make sure that heterogeneity across countries are not driven by asymmetries in the respective
business cycles.
Replacement Rates

In order to parameterize the level of unemployment benefits differently

for each country we utilize data on the average net replacement rates, i.e. the ratio between
unemployment benefits and average net wages. We use data from the OECD Wages and Statistics
Dataset, averaging net replacement rates for the period 2005-2011 to smooth out business cycle
fluctuations. Replacement rates are constructed for the average worker across the same sectors in
all countries, to maximize comparability.
Gross Domestic Product

We use data on 2011 Gross Domestic Product (PPP) in international

dollars from the World Bank World Development Indicators.
Capital Shares

We calculate capital shares using labor share data from the OECD. We average

labor income shares for the period 2005-2012 and calculate the capital share α as the complement
to one of the labor share.
Stocks and skill compositions, 2000-2011 In section 5.2.2 above, we analyze the welfare effect
for natives of the actual 2000-2011 migration flows across countries. Unfortunately, we are aware
of no perfect data for this exercise. This is due to the fact that using stock data is undesirable,
because differences in stocks are driven by population dynamics unrelated to migration. Therefore,
one would want to use data on net flows in this period. Regrettably, we are aware of no skill-specific
flow data for these countries.
Therefore, we use OECD data on inflows and outflows to construct net flows in the period
2000-2011, which we use to construct the size of the treatment. Since we are unable to have
information of the skill composition of that specific flow, we will use stock data for 2000 from the
dataset constructed by Frédéric Docquier, Çaglar Özden, Christopher Parsons and Ehran Artuc,
aggregated at the level of the destination country.
