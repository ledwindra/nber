Collusion at the Extensive Margin

JEL No. C73,L41
ABSTRACT
We augment the multi-market collusion model of Bernheim and Whinston (1990) by allowing for
firm entry into, and exit from, individual markets. We show that this gives rise to a new mechanism
by which a cartel can sustain a collusive agreement: Collusion at the extensive margin whereby firms
collude by avoiding entry into each other’s markets or territories. We characterise parameter values
that sustain this type of collusion and identify the assumptions where this collusion is more likely to
hold than its intensive margin counterpart. Specifically, it is demonstrated that Where duopoly competition
is fierce collusion at the extensive margin is always sustainable. The model predicts new forms of
market sharing such as oligopolistic competition with a collusive fringe, and predatory entry. We also
provide a theoretic foundation for the use of a proportional response enforcement mechanism.

Introduction

It has long been understood that the existence of multiple markets creates the
potential for market sharing; a collusive agreement in which each member of a
cartel is assigned monopoly rights over a territory (see for example Edwards,
1955; Stigler, 1964). A common feature of market sharing models is that, when
a firm deviates, it captures a share of its rival’s market before its rival has
the opportunity to respond (see for example Bernheim and Whinston, 1990;
Gross and Holahan, 2003; Belleflamme and Bloch, 2008; Bond and Syropoulos,
2008). This seems a reasonable assumption for industries in which products
are manufactured in a firm’s home market, before being transported for sale
in foreign markets. If, as is the case for many commodities, transportation is
quicker than production, a firm’s arrival in a market could catch incumbents
off guard.
There are, however, many industries in which a firm cannot contest a market without first establishing a presence in that market. If the process of entry
is observable and takes a sufficiently long time, incumbents will have the opportunity to adjust their behaviour within the market in anticipation of the
entrant’s arrival. This fundamentally alters both the incentives for a firm to
deviate from a cartel agreement, and the mechanisms by which the cartel can
punish deviations.
In this paper, we augment the multi-market collusion model of Bernheim
and Whinston (1990) (henceforth BW) by incorporating an explicit mechanism
for firm entry into, and exit from, individual markets. In each period, firms
decide which markets to contest before selecting their behaviour within each
market. While a firm can surprise its rivals by its decision to enter a market,
this action is observable. From the perspective of collusion, participation in
a market, rather than simply actions within markets, can form the basis of
histories that enforce collusive outcomes in a repeated non-cooperative games.
Cartels can assign different markets to different firms with a deviation being
entry by a firm into a market not assigned to it. That such entry could trigger
counter-entry by rivals is what disciplines cartel behaviour. We term such

1

outcomes collusion at the extensive margin to distinguish it from collusion at
the intensive margin, based on firms’ behaviour within markets (in terms of
price setting and quantity restrictions) that has been the focus of most of the
formal literature to date.
Our model is relevant to a number of industries that are subject to ongoing
regulatory scrutiny. As an example, consider the antitrust case against Rural
Press and Waikerie that was adjudicated by the High Court of Australia. Rural
Press marketed a newspaper, The Murray River Standard, in the towns of
Murray Bridge and Mannum (among others) while Waikerie operated another
newspaper, The River News in Waikerie; all along the Murray River in South
Australia. When Waikerie started selling and marketing (to advertisers), The
River News in Mannum, Rural Press responded with a (draft) letter:
The attached copies of pages from The River News were sent to
me last week. The Mannum advertising was again evident, which
suggests your Waikerie operator, John Pick, is still not focussing
on the traditional area of operations.
I wanted to formally record my desire to reach an understanding
with your family in terms of where each of us focuses our publishing
efforts.
If you continue to attack in Mannum, a prime readership area
of the Murray Valley Standard, it may be we will have to look at
expanding our operations into areas that we have not traditionally
services [sic].
I thought I would write to you so there could be no misunderstanding our position. I will not bother you again on this subject.1
Waikerie promptly exited Mannum. The Australian courts found that this
was an anti-competitive agreement and fined both parties (see Gans, Sood and
Williams, 2004). Note that this did not involve attempted collusion within the
Mannum area but instead a division of geographic markets along the Murray

River. Note also that the antitrust violation resulted from the enforcement of
a deviation from an implied ‘agreement’ and, indeed, the newspapers exist in
their separate markets today.
Interestingly, Stigler (1964) briefly considered this type of collusion but
dismissed it, writing:
. . . the conditions appropriate to the assignment of customers will
exist in certain industries, and in particular the geographical division of the market has often been employed. Since an allocation
of buyers is an obvious and easily detectable violation of the Sherman Act, we may again infer that an efficient method of enforcing
a price agreement is excluded by the antitrust laws. (p.47)
However, today, it is more likely that, absent evidence of an explicit agreement
or a ‘smoking gun’ letter, such as existed in the Australian case, collusion at the
extensive margin would be difficult to prosecute. Specifically, the successful
prosecution in the Australian case is likely an exception rather than the rule
with the investigation being triggered by off the equilibrium path behaviour
rather than the collusive outcome itself. Indeed, in 2007, in Bell Atlantic v.
Twombly 2 the US Supreme Court examined the complaint that Baby Bell
telephone companies violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by refraining from
entering each other’s geographic markets. The Court recognized that “sparse
competition among large firms dominating separate geographical segments of
the market could very well signify illegal agreement.” However, they did not
consider that an unwillingness on the part of Baby Bells to break with past
behaviour and compete head to head was necessarily a conspiracy. The Court
concluded that the implicit refraining of competition was a natural business
practice; placing an evidentiary burden on off the equilibrium path behaviour.3

Bell Atlc v. Twombly 550 U.S. 544 (2007).
Our model also shows how a system of mutual forbearance can be sustained when each
firm operates in a different product market. For instance, accounts of Apple and Google’s
recent falling out have indicated that this arose when Google entered into the mobile phone
industry (with hardware as well as software) challenging Apple’s iPhone (Stone and Helft,
2010). It was reported that Apple’s response (possibly restricting Google applications on
the iPhone as well as acquiring a mobile advertising start-up) was the result of Google’s
violation of a ‘gentleman’s agreement.’

The paper proceeds as follows. The model is detailed in section 2. There
we add an explicit participation stage (where firms choose which markets to
enter and/or exit) to the stage game in BW. We also state conditions under
which a maximal competitive outcome can arise in equilibrium. Collusion utilising a grim-trigger strategy is considered in section 3. Significantly, we show
that mutual avoidance outperforms multi-market contact if duopoly profits
are sufficiently small. That is, a more intense baseline level of market competition makes collusion at the extensive margin stable at discount factors
where collusion at the intensive margin cannot be sustained. In addition, we
discuss the role of entry costs and also asymmetries between markets in terms
of their value to the cartel. Uncertainty is introduced into the model in section 4. We show that reducing the length of the punishment phase increases
expected profits at the expense of cartel stability. Moreover, expected profits may be further improved if cartel punishments are target at the deviating
firm and scale with the size of the initial deviation. Finally, in section 5 we
describe two novel forms of market sharing agreement predicted by the model,
oligopoly with a collusive fringe and predatory entry. These are of interest
because they involve observable behaviour that is distinct from the normal
indicia of anti-competitive behaviour examined by anti-trust authorities. A
final section concludes.

2

The multi-market model

The seminal paper in the multi-market collusion is BW (1990). In their model,
firms tacitly collude over the levels of ‘within market’ actions such as price
and quantity. Here we preserve that possibility but add another dimension for
collusion based on ‘market participation.’ Specifically, rather than taking the
choice of market presence as a costless one for firms, we assume that entry
involves costs and takes some time. Consequently, while it may be that those
deviating from a collusive agreement on ‘within market’ actions can profit prior
to a reaction by others, when it comes to collusion based on participation,

others can react fully if a deviation is observed.4
While our model allows for collusion over market actions and market participation, it will be useful to distinguish between two distinct types of collusive
agreement. When multiple firms coordinate their behaviour within a single
market, we say that they are colluding at the intensive margin of that market.
If instead, the firms coordinate their participation across a set of markets, each
acting as a monopolist in a subset of markets, we say that they are colluding
at the extensive margin.

2.1

Preliminaries

Consider an infinite-horizon game in which a set I of identical firms interact
repeatedly over a set N of discrete markets. It is assumed that kIk ≥ 2 while
kN k ≥ kIk.5 All firms discount the future by the common discount factor
δ ∈ (0, 1).
The timing of the game is set out in figure 1. Any given period, t, begins
with the participation stage in which firms decide which markets they will
contest. Formally, firm i’s participation stage action is a subset ati ⊆ N . The
inclusion of a market n ∈ ati indicates that firm i will contest market n in
period t, while n ∈
/ ati indicates that i will be absent from n.
Entry and/or exit occurs when a firm’s participation stage action differs
across consecutive periods. Specifically, firm i is said to enter (resp. exit)
4

BW (1990) (see also Belleflamme and Bloch, 2008) have a variant of their model where
the costs of producing in a given market involve some fixed costs for the firm. However,
they assume that if a firm is merely present in a market but does not produce, its costs are
zero. By contrast, we assume that being present in a market requires an observable step
and investment even though once a firm is present in a market, collusion over the precise
level of output is possible.

(resp. n ∈ at−1
and n ∈

i
i
Entry by firm i into market n costs an amount ci,n ≥ 0. The entry cost is only
incurred in the period in which entry occurs. As in BW, the cost of maintaining
a presence in a market following entry is assumed to be accounted for in
the market’s profit function outlined below. If a firm exits and subsequently
reenters a market the entry cost must be paid again. Importantly, this entry
cost means that firms must commit to be present in a market and can also
commit not to be present.
Following the participation stage, the profile of firm participation at =
{ati }i∈I is revealed to the market. Thus, all firms know the number and identities of their rivals in each market, when they compete in the subsequent
market stage.
In the market stage firms choose actions for each of the markets they are
contesting. Formally, firm i selects an action xti,n for each market n ∈ ati . The
nature of the action xti,n depends on the competitive environment of the market
in question. For example, xti,n could represent a choice of price, quantity or
quality.
Profits are realised at the conclusion of the market stage. The profit that
firm i earns in market n is given by the function πn (xti,n , xt−i,n ).6 Because firms
are identical, the profit function does not vary between firms (although it may
vary between markets).
Firms seek to maximise the present value of their lifetime profits. For firm
i, this is,

The profit function

For any given number of participating firms, the (oligopolistically) competitive
outcome in a market is the Nash equilibrium of a one-shot market stage game;
6

The term xt−i,n represents the actions of all firms other than i in market n, and so is
contingent on at .

6

the equilibrium outcome where each participating firm selects an action xti,n
and receives a payoff πn (xti,n , xt−i,n ).
Let φtn represent the number of firms contesting market n in period t.
For all φtn ∈ {1, . . . , kIk} we assume that there exists an action x∗n (φtn ), such
that all firms choosing x∗n (φtn ) is the unique Nash equilibrium of the one-shot
market stage game in market n with φtn participants. The corresponding Nash
equilibrium profit of a participating firm is written πn∗ (φtn ).
The monopoly action and profit for market n are, thus, x∗n (1) and πn∗ (1)
respectively, while x∗n (I) and πn∗ (I) represent Nash equilibrium actions and
profits when all firms in I contest market n. The following assumption describes the relationship between the number of firms contesting a market and
equilibrium profits.
Assumption 1 (Expansion incentive) For all n ∈ N and φtn ∈ {1, . . . , kIk−
1},
φn πn∗ (φtn ) > (φtn + 1)πn∗ (φtn + 1).

(3)

Moreover,

(2) states that an increase in the number of firms contesting a market reduces the equilibrium profit of each incumbent firm. Moreover, the reduction
in each firm’s equilibrium profit is sufficiently large that total market profits
also fall. A lower bound on equilibrium profits is established in (3). It states
that, even under the most competitive conditions, the discounted sum of lifetime Nash equilibrium profits is sufficient to recoup the cost of entry into the
market.

2.3

Participation strategies and equilibria

In the infinite-horizon game, the history in period t is a record of the actions

taken in the preceding periods ht = (a0 , x0 ), . . . , (at−1 , xt−1 ) , where the
vector xτ = {xτi,n }i∈I,n∈N represents the actions of all firms, in all markets, in
period τ . All prior actions are observable so there is no uncertainty regarding
7

past behaviour. The history ht can be decomposed into the participation
history htP = {a0 , . . . , at−1 } and the market stage history htM = {x0 , . . . , xt−1 }.
BW (1990) focus exclusively on collusion at the intensive margin where the
participation history is not relevant. In their model, a cartel cares only about
the market stage history as it already knows that all firms are present in all
markets.
By contrast, we want to focus on collusion at the extensive margin, or
what we will call participation equilibria, where strategies are conditioned on
the participation history and not on the market stage history.7 Formally, we
say that firm i is employing a participation strategy if ati and {xti,n }n∈ati are independent of the market stage history htM for all ht and t ∈ {0, 1, . . . }. We call
a sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) in which all firms employ participation
strategies, a participation equilibrium.
It is important to note that while, by definition, all firms employ participation strategies in a participation equilibrium, participation equilibria must
be robust against unilateral deviations by any firm, at any history, to any
strategy, including non-participation strategies. Thus, the set of participation
equilibria is a subset of the set of all SPEs, and the concept should be viewed
as an equilibrium refinement rather than an alternative solution concept.
This fact notwithstanding, the following lemma establishes that a profile
of participation strategies constitutes a participation equilibrium if, and only
if, it is robust to deviations within the class of participation strategies.
Lemma 1 Suppose that all firms j 6= i play participation strategies. Firm i
has a best-response that is likewise a participation strategy.
Proof. Because atj and {xtj,n }n∈atj are independent of htM for all ht , t ∈
{0, 1, . . . } and j 6= i, the set of firm i’s best responses is likewise independent of htM for all ht and t ∈ {0, 1, . . . }. 
Another characteristic of a participation equilibrium is that market stage
actions and profits must be identical to the Nash equilibrium actions and
profits of a one-shot market stage game. The following lemma established
7

Thus, they can arise even if market stage history where unobserved.

8

this result. Moreover, it allows us to omit market stage actions when we
characterise participation equilibria.
Lemma 2 In a participation equilibrium xti,n = x∗n (φtn ) for all n ∈ ati , i ∈ I,
ht and t ∈ {0, 1, . . . }.
Proof. Consider the market stage of period t. Because each firm’s strategy is
independent of the market stage history, a firm’s only concern is to maximise
the its profits in each of the markets it is contesting. By assumption, this
occurs when xti,n = x∗n (φtn ) for all n ∈ ati and i ∈ I. 

2.4

The competitive baseline

To conclude this section we establish the existence of a competitive equilibrium.
This equilibrium is a participation equilibrium and exists under very general
conditions. The competitive equilibrium serves as the baseline against which
the various collusive equilibria can be compared.
Proposition 1 (Competitive equilibrium) There exists a participation equilibrium in which ati = N for all i ∈ I, ht and t ∈ {0, 1, . . . }.
Proof. Given that all firms seek to enter every market regardless of the history,
the expansion incentive (assumption 1) makes expanding into every market a
best response. 
In a competitive equilibrium, firms employ strategies that are independent
of the entire history of the game. Along the equilibrium path, all firms enter
and remain in every market. In a given market n, all firms take the competitive
action x∗n (I) and receive the competitive profit πn∗ (I). The competitive equilibrium is very robust, existing for all δ ∈ (0, 1). Proposition 1 is significant for
our analysis as it implies that wherever firms collude at the extensive margin,
they do so in an environment in which there exists a competitive participation
equilibrium (and hence a competitive SPE) which is at least as robust.

Collusion by mutual avoidance

Consider the case of a cartel that assigns to each of its members, monopoly
control over a subset of markets. If Ni ⊂ N represents the set of markets
assigned to firm i, the cartel agreement can be represented by the partition

P = N∅ , {Ni }i∈I . Included in the partition P is the (possibly empty) set
N∅ ⊂ N representing unassigned markets that all firms are free to contest. The
profile of participation that implements P is aP = {aPi }i∈I , where aPi = Ni ∪N∅
for all i ∈ I.
A cartel agreement of this type is simple and easy to monitor. The cartel
has no interest in how a firm behaves in any given market, it only matters
which markets each firm contests. A deviation from the agreement occurs if
one firm enters a market assigned to a another firm. Absent a response, such
entry is profitable by assumption 1.
In order to prevent deviations, a cartel must employ an enforcement mechanism. The only way to punish a firm is to enter some or all of its markets,
competing away its monopoly profits. In this section, we consider the strongest
available enforcement mechanism, a grim-trigger strategy. Temporary and targeted punishments are considered in section 4.

3.1

The grim-strategy equilibrium

In a perfect information setting, the most robust collusive equilibrium is the
equilibrium with the strongest enforcement. The greatest punishment that
can be imposed by participation strategies is for any transgression to cause
the game to permanently revert to the competitive equilibrium set out in
proposition 1.
The following proposition characterises the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a grim-strategy equilibrium:
Proposition 2 (Grim-strategy equilibrium) Consider the following participation strategy profile: For all i ∈ I, if there exists τ < t and k 6= l such that
aτk ∩ Nl 6= ∅ then ati = N ; otherwise ati = aPi . This strategy profile constitutes
10

Proof. From the proof of proposition 1, it follows that if a firm triggers the
punishment phase by entering a rival’s market in period t (atk ∩ Nl 6= ∅ for
some k 6= l), reversion to the competitive equilibrium from period t+1 onward
is an equilibrium of the sub-game.
From assumption 1 it follows that the worst case deviation is for a firm i

to enter the set of all markets assigned to rival firms ( j6=i Nj ). This deviation
is not profitable if,

for all i ∈ I. That is, the profits firm i receives as a result of retaining exclusive
control of the markets in Ni must be higher than the profits it receives in a
competitive equilibrium, from all markets assigned to cartel members (N \N∅ ).
Indeed, if (5) is satisfied for all i ∈ I then there exists a δ ∈ (0, 1) satisfying
(4).
More generally, (4) highlights the way in which cartel stability depends on
the symmetry of the partition. Minimising δG requires an even distribution
of monopoly profits between the cartel members. The contested component
of the partition can play a useful role here. By assigning asymmetrically
11

valuable markets to N∅ , the cartel removes a powerful incentive for rival firms
to deviate. Note that profits from the markets in N∅ do not appear anywhere in
(4). All firms receive πn∗ (I) from each market n ∈ N∅ , regardless of whether the
game is on the equilibrium path or has reverted to the competitive equilibrium.
Proposition 2 also illustrates the impact of entry costs on cartel stability. It
P
follows from (4) that δG is decreasing in n∈S Nj ci,n . This term represents
j6=i

the cost to firm i of initiating a deviation. As the cost of entry increases,
the net return from entering a rival’s market decreases, and cartel stability
improves.

3.2

Identical markets and costless entry

It is instructive to consider cartel stability in a special case where (a) entry
costs are zero (a worse case for stability) and (b) markets are identical (allowing
straightforward allocations). We will here assume that ci,n = 0 for all i ∈ I
and n ∈ N and also that πm (·) = πn (·) for all m, n ∈ N ; dropping the market
subscripts for simplicity. It is also useful to define ni = kNi k and n∅ = kN∅ k.
With identical markets and zero entry costs (4) reduces to,

Note that the fraction in (6) is increasing in the number of markets assigned
P
to rival firms ( j6=i nj ) and decreasing in the number of markets over which
firm i has monopoly control (ni ).
When markets are identical, the firm i that maximises (6), and, therefore,
determines the level of the critical discount factor, is the firm with the smallest partition. It follows that cartel stability is maximised when all firms are
assigned the same number of markets, with any remaining markets assigned
to N∅ . The minimum critical discount factor for a cartel of kIk firms is thus,
δG =

(kIk − 1)π ∗ (2)
< 1,
π ∗ (1) + (kIk − 1)π ∗ (2) − kIkπ ∗ (I)

(7)

where the inequality follows from (2). The RHS of (7) is unambiguously
12

increasing in kIk. It follows that the stability of the cartel falls with each
additional member.

3.3

Mutual avoidance versus multi-market contact

We now turn to compare mutual avoidance that arises in collusion purely at
the extensive market with multi-market contact as examined by BW (1990).
Here we discuss three broad substantive areas where the stability of each type
of collusion depends on distinct structural characteristics of the environment:
they are symmetries across markets, the level of entry costs and the time taken
for entry.
First, with respect to markets themselves, BW (1990) provide an irrelevance result and show that, if markets are identical, the cartel will be no more
stable than a cartel colluding in a single representative market. Intuitively,
while multi-market contact does increase the magnitude of the punishments
that may be imposed on a deviating firm, it proportionately increases the incentive to deviate. This implies that it is asymmetries between markets that
facilitate stability in intensive margin collusion. By contrast, as demonstrated
above, stability in extensive margin collusion is facilitated by symmetry so
that markets of equivalent total value can be divided up amongst firms.
Second, for multi-market contact, entry costs, if any,8 are incurred in the
collusive equilibrium across all markets whereas under collusion at the extensive margin, entry costs are only incurred by firms in the markets they are
allocated. Consequently, suppose that under collusion of both types, monopoly
profit outcomes arise across markets. Then, net of any entry costs, the profits
accruing to each firm would be the same but total entry costs would be correspondingly higher under collusion at the intensive margin. Thus, from the
cartel’s perspective, collusion at the extensive margin would Pareto dominate
with the outcomes being equivalent as entry costs went to zero.
Third, as noted earlier, a key difference between BW (1990) and the model
8

BW do not consider entry costs but they are potentially present in our model here.
Specifically, in order for a firm to react quickly to a rival’s deviation within a market, entry
(which takes time and costs) would have to occur ex ante.

13

presented here is not so much that entry costs exist but that entry can be observed and takes time. Thus, while it is the case that deviating from intensive
margin collusion allows a firm to capture profits that arise when their rivals
continue to choose their collusive within market actions, when deviating from
extensive margin collusion, rivals can observe a deviation and react to it in the
market where it occurs. Of course, it takes time (one period) for the reaction
to occur across all markets (just as it does for BW). In what follows, we consider in detail precisely when this difference between the models implies that
one type of collusion is more stable than another, employing the assumptions
of identical markets and zero entry costs so as to remove other reasons for a
difference in stability outcomes between collusion types.
For extensive margin collusion, we assume an outcome where markets are
allocated equally amongst firms and are enforced via a grim-trigger mechanism
considered earlier. For the intensive margin outcome, consider the following
cartel agreement in which kIk identical firms collude at the intensive margin
of kN k identical markets. Under the cartel agreement, each firm establishes a
permanent presence in every market. Firms coordinate market stage actions
such that each firm receives an equal share of the monopoly profit (π ∗ (1)/kIk)
from each market.
The cartel employs the grim-trigger strategy as its enforcement mechanism.
If a firm reneges on the cartel agreement, it receives a profit of π dev from each
market in which it deviates from the agreed behaviour. Any deviation is
punished by permanent reversion to the competitive equilibrium.
Proposition 3 A cartel that colludes at the extensive margin has a lower
critical discount factor that a cartel colluding at the intensive margin if, and
only if,

Now consider a cartel colluding at the intensive margin. The worst case for
this type of cartel occurs when a firm deviates in all markets simultaneously.

π ∗ (1) + kIkπ dev − π ∗ (1) − kIkπ ∗ (I)

(9)

Note that δcrit is increasing in the difference kIkπ dev − π ∗ (1). Comparing (7)
and (9) it is clear that δG < δcrit if and only if (8) holds. 
Proposition 3 has a straightforward interpretation. The LHS of (8) represents the net gain (per market) of deviating when a cartel coordinates behaviour within markets. The RHS of (8) represents the net gain (averaged
across all markets) of deviating when a cartel coordinates participation across
markets. The most stable cartel is the cartel with the lowest return to a
deviation.
What is interesting here is that cartel stability is influenced by the intrinsic
intensity of competition within markets. To see this, suppose that firms are
selling close substitutes and competing by setting prices; i.e., competition
within the market is intrinsically highly competitive. If a cartel is colluding
at the intensive margin, a firm can capture an entire market by marginally
undercutting its rivals. A firm thus earns πdev ≈ π ∗ (1) from each market in
which it initiates a deviation. In contrast, the duopoly profit π ∗ (2) is close to
zero. With these values (8) holds for all kIk ≥ 2.9
This Bertrand case highlights the key difference between the two collusive
mechanisms. When a firm deviates under intensive margin collusion, it surprises its rivals in the market stage, undercutting them and stealing the entire
market. In contrast, in order to deviate from an extensive margin collusive
agreement, a firm must first enter markets assigned to its rivals. Entry is
observable and provides the remaining cartel members with sufficient time to
adjust their own prices in anticipation of the entrant’s arrival. Thus, the best
9

The critical discount factor for intensive margin collusion in this example is δcrit =
(kIk − 1)/kIk, while for extensive margin collusion δG is close to zero.

15

the deviating firm can hope for is duopoly profits. In this example, duopoly
profits are negligible and hence, extensive margin collusion is more stable.
A counter example is the case of Cournot competition with constant marginal
cost and a linear demand curve (generally, considered a less intense competitive environment than Bertrand). Suppose that the cartel agreement requires
each firm to produce a fraction 1/kIk of the monopoly quantity in each market.
In this example,
πdev =

(kIk + 1)2 ∗
4
π (1) and π ∗ (2) = π ∗ (1).
2
4kIk
9

Substituting these values into (8) violates the inequality for all kIk ∈ {2, 3, . . . }.
In the case of Cournot competition, intensive margin collusion is more stable than extensive margin collusion. When a firm deviates from an intensive
margin collusive agreement it produces (kIk + 1)/2kIk of the monopoly quantity. The remaining firms in the market produce (kIk−1)/kIk of the monopoly
quantity, delivering the deviating firm a net gain of,

per market. In contrast, entry into a monopoly controlled market is attractive
as Cournot duopolists earn substantial profits.
In summary, while it is the case that collusive outcomes are generally more
stable the more competitive is the non-collusive environment, collusion at the
intensive margin becomes less stable relative to collusion at the extensive margin, the more competitive the non-collusive environment becomes. Indeed, in
the limit, collusion at the extensive margin is a possible equilibrium regardless
of the discount factor.

Uncertainty

Since Green and Porter (1984) it has been understood that temporary punishments have advantages over the grim-trigger strategy where uncertainty
triggers punishments along the equilibrium path. In this section we show that
the scale and scope of punishments are also important.
16

4.1

The structure of uncertainty

For the purposes of this section we assume that the source of uncertainty is
the possibility that a firm makes an error in the participation stage, contesting more markets than the firm intended. Such an error might occur if an
overzealous manager, unaware of the existence of the cartel, overstepped their
authority and initiated entry into a market without seeking permission from
his or her superiors.
Suppose that firm i makes a mistake and contests markets assigned to a
subset of firms K ⊆ I \ {i}. Let dk ∈ {1, 2, . . . } represent the number of firms
belonging to a firm k ∈ K that firm i contests. The complete profile of firm i’s
mistake is written dK = {dk }k∈K . The probability that this mistake occurs is
written σ(i, K, dK ) > 0. It will be useful to define the following probabilities,
σ(i, K) =

X

σ(i, K, dK ) and σ(i) =

dK

X

σ(i, K).

K⊆I\{i}

Here σ(i, K) is the overall probability that firm i enters markets belonging to
a subset of firms K ⊆ I \ {i}, while σ(i) is the probability of firm i making a
mistake of any sort.
In order to simplify the analysis we make two further assumptions concerning the structure of uncertainty. Neither of these assumptions is necessary,
however each reduces the notation considerably. First, the probability of two
or more firms making an error in the same period is arbitrarily close to zero.
Second, an error can only occur if all firms implement the cartel agreement in
the participation stage.
In contrast with Green and Porter (1984), the errors made by firms in our
model are real. When a firm makes a mistake and enters a rival’s market
it profits from that mistake. The expected gains to firm i from mistakes it
makes, less the expected losses due to mistakes by other cartel members, are,

4.2

Un-targeted enforcement

The first temporary enforcement mechanism we consider is un-targeted enforcement. Under un-targeted enforcement, all firms respond to a deviation
by reverting to the competitive equilibrium for τ periods. Following the conclusion of the punishment phase, firms withdraw from markets assigned to rival
firms, restoring the collusive partition. The punishment phase of un-targeted
enforcement is the analogue of a price war in intensive margin collusion.

Proposition 4 characterises the critical discount factor and expected profits
for a cartel employing un-targeted enforcement. In common with Green and
Porter (1984), increasing the length of the punishment phase increases cartel
stability at the expense of expected profits. Unlike Green and Porter (1984), it
is possible for a cartel to be stable when punishments last for a single period.
Once again, the critical discount factors depend on the profits a firm earns
from a deviation. If duopoly competition is fierce and duopoly profits are close
to zero, both δU∞ and δU1 will likewise tend to zero. Under these circumstance
single-period punishments are more than adequate to ensure cartel stability.
It is important to note that the efficacy of this enforcement mechanism,
as well as the others discussed in this section, is predicated on the ability of
a firm to reenter a market it has previously withdrawn from. If exiting a
market damages a firm’s reputation in a manner that makes reentry difficult,
the credibility of temporary punishment is diminished and the cartel would
have to rely on the grim-trigger strategy.10

4.3

Targeted enforcement

If there is slack between the discount factor δ, and the critical discount factor
for single-period un-targeted enforcement δU1 , the cartel may be able to further
improve expected profits by employing targeted enforcement.
Targeted enforcement treats deviations as bilateral disagreements. Suppose
that firm i deviates from the cartel agreement in period t, entering markets
belonging to a subset of firms K ⊆ I \ {i}. The responsibility for punishing
firm i falls on its victims. In period t + 1 all firms in K enter all markets
in Ni competing away firm i’s profits, while firm i contests every market in
P
j∈K Nj . The punishment phase concludes after a single period with all firms
withdrawing to their respective markets in period t + 2.
Notice that, under targeted enforcement, the only firms involved in the
punishment phase are the deviating firm and its victims. Moreover, the victims only retaliate against the aggressor, they do not target each other. The
remaining cartel members play no part.
The probability of firm i either making a mistake, or being a victim of an
error, is,

Proof. First note that zi,T is the expected profit of firm i in a period in which
firm i is a party to a punishment phase that occurs along the equilibrium path,
excluding the profits it earns from the markets in N∅ .
Outside of a punishment phase, the continuation value of the game to firm
i from selecting the participation stage action aPi is,

Vi+ = ni π ∗ (1) + εi + n∅ π ∗ (I) + δ(1 − σi )Vi+ + δσi zi,T + n∅ π ∗ (I) + δVi+ .
Solving for Vi+ yields the expected profit of firm i. If, instead, firm i deviates,
entering every market belonging to a rival firm, the continuation value of the
game is,

Taking the limit of this inequality as σ(i, K, dK ) → 0 for all i ∈ I, K ⊆ I \ {i}
and dK (and therefore εi → 0 and σi zi,T → 0), and solving for δ yields the
limit of δT . Notice that the difference Vi+ − Vi− is continuous in each of its
arguments and therefore δT must likewise be a continuous function of the
continuous variables.
It only remains to establish that firm i will not deviate during a punishment phase if Vi+ − Vi− ≥ 0. Suppose that a punishment phase occurs in
period t. Firm i has no incentive to contest fewer markets than the enforcement mechanism dictates as each market contested delivers firm i a positive
profit. Moreover, if firm i enters a market that it was not supposed to contest,
this action triggers a new punishment phase in period t + 1. The gain to firm
i from such a deviation must be less than the gain from entering every market belonging to a rival firm when all remaining firms implement the cartel
agreement. 
Proposition 5 demonstrates that where the probability of each error is
small, the critical discount factor is in the neighbourhood of (10). This means
that a cartel utilising targeted enforcement is less stable than a cartel utilising
single-period un-targeted enforcement as,

Although, it should be noted that the two mechanisms are equivalent if there
are only two firms in the cartel. A cartel may prefer targeted enforcement if it
delivers firms higher expected profits. This is a possibility because, along the
equilibrium path, firms are less likely to be involved in a punishment phase
under targeted enforcement.

4.4

Proportional response enforcement

An obvious alternative to targeted enforcement is proportional response enforcement. Proportional response enforcement functions in exactly the same
way as targeted enforcement except that the magnitude of punishments scale
with the size of the initial deviations. Whereas, under targeted enforcement,
22

a deviation results in a complete breakdown in the bilateral relationship between instigator and victim for the duration of the punishment phase, under
proportion response enforcement punishments ‘fit the crime’.
Suppose that firm i enters dj markets belonging to firm j. In the punishment phase, firm j is required to retaliate proportionally, entering ni dj /nj of
firm i’s markets. If ni dj /nj is not an integer, firm j can enter the required
number of markets in expectation, conditioning entry into the final market on
a random variable that is observed by all cartel members. During the punishment phase firm i continues its presence in the dj markets it entered in the
previous period but expands no further. Any expansion of firm i’s presence in
firm j’s markets during the punishment phase is regarded as a fresh deviation
and results in another punishment phase in the subsequent period.
The following proposition demonstrates that proportional response enforcement outperforms targeted enforcement in terms of both expected profits and
stability. For the purposes of the following proposition it is useful to relabel

Proof. Along the equilibrium path, proportional response enforcement only
differs from targeted enforcement in the expected profit of a firm i, in a period
in which firm i is a party to a punishment phase. For proportional response
enforcement this is zi,PR . Note that zi,PR ≥ zi,T , with strict inequality if nj ≥ 2
for some j ∈ I. The value and lower bound of Πi,PR then follows from the
proof of proposition 5.
In common with targeted enforcements, the worst case deviation occurs
when firm i enters every market belonging to a rival firm. It follows from the
proof of proposition 5 that a necessary condition for cartel stability is,

Taking the limit of this inequality as σ(i, K, dK ) → 0 for all i ∈ I, K ⊆ I \ {i}
and dK (and therefore εi → 0 and σi zi,PR → 0), and solving for δ yields the
limit of δPR .
Given that zi,PR ≥ zi,T , if (11) is satisfied for some δ then (12) must also
be satisfied. Moreover, if nj ≥ 2 for some j ∈ I, and therefore zi,PR > zi,T ,
there must exist values of δ for which (12) is satisfied and (11) is not. Finally,
from the proof of proposition 5 it follows that if (12) is satisfied, no firm has
an incentive to deviate during a punishment phase. 
Proposition 6 is significant as, to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first game theoretic justification for the use of proportional response in selfenforcing contracts. Intuitively, the probability of a firm being involved in a
punishment phase along the equilibrium path is the same as under targeted
enforcement — under both mechanisms participation is confined to the deviating firm and its victims — however the expected profits from the punishment

24

phase will be higher if there is a chance that the punishment will not encompass
all of a firm’s markets.

5

Applications

In this section we consider two examples in which the existence of an atypical market gives rise to forms of market sharing than would not usually be
predicted by models of collusion.

5.1

Oligopolistic competition with a collusive fringe

Suppose that a single large market L exists alongside the set of identical small
markets N . Let πL∗ (·) denote the profit function of the large market, while
π ∗ (·) is the profit function for each of the small markets. We assume that
competitive profits in the large market satisfy,
πL∗ (I) >

kN k ∗
π (1) − kN kπ ∗ (I).
kIk − 1

It follows from (5) that if L is assigned to a firm by the cartel, extensive margin
collusion will not be stable for any δ ∈ (0, 1).
The large market creates a problem for the cartel because any firm that
is excluded from the large market has an overwhelming incentive to enter. In
order to form a stable agreement, L must be assigned to the contested component of the partition N∅ . This neutralises the large market as a determinant of
cartel stability, because the markets in N∅ are contested by every firm regardless of history. The cartel can then partition the small markets in N between
its members, as it would have in the absence of the large market.
The lesson here is that we cannot use the degree of competition in a large
market as an indicator of whether or not collusion is occurring in small peripheral markets. It is entirely possible to have oligopolistic competition with
a collusive fringe.
There are a number of market structures that may display a collusive fringe.
Consider, for example, the market for beer or sodas. The firms in these markets tend to compete vigorously with one and other, selling their products
25

through supermarkets and liquor stores. At the same time these same firms
sign exclusive deals with restaurant chains, sporting venues and entertainment
venues; effectively partitioning the small client relationships peripheral to the
main consumer market. Another environment in which a collusive fringe may
be found is where a major population centre is surrounded by a number of
small regional centres. A collusive fringe may exist where a number of firms
compete within the major population centre while avoiding contact in the
smaller regional markets.
Of course, neither exclusive dealing nor geographic monopoly necessarily
imply the existence of a collusive fringe. The key to detecting a collusive fringe
lies in identifying the duopoly profit from the small markets. If the duopoly
profit less discounted entry cost is positive, the partitioning of these markets
is not consistent with competitive behaviour and we can conclude that we are
observing collusion at the extensive margin.11

5.2

Predatory entry

Thus far, we have assumed that all firms have an expansion incentive; that
is, absent a collusive agreement they would expand to all markets. Here we
relax this assumption. Consider a multi-market game with two firms (I =
{1, 2}) and two markets (N = {m, d}). Market m is assumed to be a natural
∗
∗
(2)), while market d is a natural duopoly (πd∗ (1) >
(1) > 0 > πm
monopoly (πm
πd∗ (2) > 0). Suppose that firm 1 is located in the natural monopoly market
while firm 2 is located in the natural duopoly. Under what circumstances is
this partition of markets stable?
The presence of the natural monopoly market introduces asymmetric incentives into the game. Firm 1 has an incentive to enter market d in order to
11

An earlier version of this paper showed that entering and colluding at the intensive
margin in such larger markets would aid in the sustainability of collusion overall. Thus,
there are circumstances where extensive and intensive margin collusion can be complements.
Nonetheless, the notion of oligopolistic competition with a collusive fringe is highlighted
here to demonstrate that just because one might observe firms competing in some markets
(especially a large and prominent one), does not mean that collusion is absent in peripheral
markets.

26

attain duopoly profits. In contrast, firm 2 has no interest in entering market m
as doing so forces the profits in market m below zero. Nevertheless, so long as
punishments are temporary firm 2 may be able to use the threat of predatory
entry into market m to enforce the cartel agreement.
We define predatory entry to be entry by a firm into a market with the
purpose of reducing the profits of that market below zero. In contrast to
predatory pricing, the goal of predatory entry is not to force rival firms out of
the market in which the losses are occurring, but rather to force a rival to exit
a second market in which both firms can coexist profitably.
Suppose that firm 2’s strategy is to punish each deviation by firm 1 with
a single period of predatory entry, consistent with the rules of the targeted
enforcement discussed in section 4. From (10) it follows that the threat of
predatory entry is sufficient to deter firm 1 from entering market d so long as,

the permanent loss of monopoly profits in market d. It follows that predatory

Conclusion

This paper has taken the standard approach to modelling tacit collusion where
firms might compete in multiple markets and added a distinct market partici27

pation choice in the stage game. Consequently, collusion can be based on the
history of participation decisions alongside any history of within market actions taken by firms. In the process, we have characterised collusive equilibria
where firms in a cartel allocate markets amongst themselves and engage in
mutual avoidance as opposed to multi-market contact. Significantly, we have
demonstrated that such collusive outcomes can be more stable as the intensity
of stage game duopoly competition becomes high; in the limit, the critical
discount factor converges to zero regardless of the number of firms in a cartel. We have also demonstrated how enforcement mechanisms that are more
proportionate to the scope of deviations may permit the same prediction of
cartel stability than broader enforcement mechanisms but be more forgiving
of misinterpretations or errors.
There, of course, remain directions for future research that would establish
whether the form of collusion highlighted in this paper is of relevance. The
challenge for empirical work is identifying firms that could compete but have
chosen not to as part of a tacit agreement. This might also be identified
by examining the patterns of participation in response to an increase in firm
ownership and asymmetries between firms following mergers.
Another avenue for investigation would be to embed the model of collusion
here in a model of antitrust enforcement (such as Harrington, 2008; Spagnolo,
2008; Choi and Gerlach, 2009). Those models consider the fact that antitrust
authorities often rely on whistleblowers to identify cartels and that, under tacit
collusion at the intensive margin, the number of people who might have knowledge of a conspiracy may be large. For example, in a model of multi-market
contact, the responsibility for implementing the cartel agreement within each
firm will likely fall on members of senior management who are in a position
to direct the firm’s activities in each market covered by the cartel agreement.
In addition, the firm’s management in each market must either be party to
the agreement, or have knowledge of its existence. These local managers will
be required to move the firm’s actions away from its best response, and refrain from any activities that would see the firm steal business from its cartel
partners.
28

Compare this with an extensive margin collusive agreement across the same
set of markets. The involvement of senior management remains. However,
because the cartel agreement requires each firm to compete as oligopolists in
contested markets, and as a monopolist where no rival firm is present, market
level management need never know of the cartel’s existence. Of course, it
could also be the case that the very act of avoidance of what would seem
to be obvious market opportunities for firms (as was the trigger to action
in Twombly), could itself bring a set of firms under scrutiny. A model that
embedded enforcement with cartel stability could tease these effects out.
Finally, we have not modelled how collusive agreements come to be formed.
As is well know, the coordination problem with repeated games is a challenge
for explaining how collusion at the intensive margin arises. It strikes us that
collusion at the extensive margin may arise in an uncoordinated fashion. For
example, two chains may start on separate parts of the country and slowly
expand. Just as they are about to overlap, they understand the potential consequences of such competition — perhaps through head to head competition
in a small set of areas. Those areas may remain competitive while the historic
locations are monopolized. The issue of the evolution of collusion is something
that we leave for future research.
