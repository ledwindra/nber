ABSTRACT
The modern notion of an international currency involves use in areas of international finance and
trade that extend well beyond central banks' coffers. In addition to their important roles as foreign
exchange reserves, international currencies are most frequently used to denominate corporate and
government bonds, bank loans, and import and export invoices. These currencies offer unrivaled
liquidity, constituting large shares of the volume on global foreign exchange markets, and are
commonly chosen as the anchors targeted by countries with pegged or managed exchange rate
regimes. In this short article, we provide evidence suggesting a recent rise in the use of the dollar,
and fall of the use in the euro, with similar patterns manifesting across all these aspects of
international currency use.

The Rise of the Dollar and Fall of the Euro
as International Currencies
By Matteo Maggiori, Brent Neiman, and Jesse Schreger∗
December 2018

The modern notion of an international currency involves use in areas of international finance and
trade that extend well beyond central banks’ coffers. In addition to their important roles as foreign
exchange reserves, international currencies are most frequently used to denominate corporate and
government bonds, bank loans, and import and export invoices. These currencies offer unrivaled
liquidity, constituting large shares of the volume on global foreign exchange markets, and are
commonly chosen as the anchors targeted by countries with pegged or managed exchange rate
regimes.1
From its launch in 1999, the euro’s global use steadily grew and, by the mid 2000s, it had
cemented its status – together with the dollar – as a key international currency. Maggiori, Neiman,
and Schreger (2018), however, demonstrate a surge in the use of the dollar and collapse in the use
of the euro to denominate internationally traded corporate and sovereign bonds starting roughly
around the time of the global financial crisis. In this article, we provide evidence suggesting that
this rise of the dollar and fall of the euro might be more pervasive, with similar patterns manifesting
across most aspects of international currency use.

1 Eichengreen et al. (2017) provides an excellent overview of these characteristics of international currencies.

What forces are driving this shift? One factor may be the instability of the euro zone, made
apparent by the recent turmoil in its sovereign debt markets. The early 2010s ushered in with a
renewed fervor discussions of possible euro-zone exits and widespread uncertainty about what any
such exit would entail. Borrowers and lenders alike might, on the margin, prefer to avoid a currency
the value of which – and, even, the mere existence of which – might be in question during the next
crisis. Another factor may be the sharp appreciation of the dollar (relative to the euro, as well as
relative to most other currencies) and maintained liquidity of trade in dollar assets during the peak
of the crisis. Dollar-denominated assets performed well precisely when such performance was most
highly valued, a key feature of an international currency, as discussed in Gourinchas et al. (2011)
and Maggiori (2017). Global investors, having learned from the recent crisis that the dollar but not
the euro provides safety, may have shifted their expectations and are more heavily coordinating on
the dollar as the only safe currency, a dynamic modeled by Farhi and Maggiori (2018) and He et al.
(2019).
The strengthening of the dollar’s position at the center of the global financial and trading system
may carry important benefits for the US. The disproportionate global use of the dollar suggests
that the US continues to enjoy an “exorbitant privilege,” borrowing at lower costs than it otherwise
would.2 As demonstrated in Maggiori et al. (2018), US corporations appear uniquely able to borrow
from foreigners even without issuing foreign currency bonds. The dollar’s use in trade invoicing
leaves US importers and exporters less exposed to exchange rate risk. And, as articulated in Farhi
and Maggiori (2018), global welfare may be higher given the existence of and coordination around
a single “safe-haven” currency.
Further dollar dominance does, however, present some risks for the global economy. Unexpected
changes in the value of the dollar can rapidly redistribute wealth across global borrowers and lenders,
as discussed in Bruno and Shin (2015). The increased use of the dollar for borrowing makes nonUS corporates more vulnerable to an unexpected dollar appreciation, and as noted in Casas et al.
(2016), the increased use of the dollar for trade invoicing means that such an appreciation might

while Caballero et al. (2008) offer a model in which this return differential emerges in equilibrium.

exacerbate home bias and dampen the scale of global trade. Finally, the euro’s declining role as
an international currency, to the extent that it brings costs for the euro zone countries, comes at
a difficult time for the Eurozone with several member countries saddled with high debt loads and
unemployment rates still at elevated levels.

I

Use in Denominating Bond and Loan Contracts

Maggiori et al. (2018), using a dataset of global mutual fund positions obtained from Morningstar,
first documented a broad surge in the dollar’s share and a collapse in the euro’s share of corporate
and sovereign bond positions. For example, the dollar and euro were used during 2005-2008 to
denominate roughly 45 and 35 percent of cross-border corporate bond positions, where the issuer
(or its ultimate parent) and investor reside in different countries. Starting around the time of the
global financial crisis, the dollar’s share increased and the euro’s share decreased until, by late
2017, they accounted for roughly 70 and 20 percent, respectively. Maggiori et al. show that this
trend is not confined to cross-border corporate positions but also holds for the total global holdings

Figure 1: Dollar and Euro Use to Denominate Bank Loans, By Sector

Figure 1 demonstrates that a similar pattern is found in data on syndicated bank loans, obtained
from SDC Platinum. We calculate the dollar and euro shares as the value of new issuances in each
of these currencies divided by the total value of syndicated loans issued in a given year. We use
the borrower’s 1-digit SIC code to report these shares for four large industries: (i) manufacturing,
(ii) finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), (iii) wholesale and retail trade (trade), and (iv)
services. These data extend back to the advent of the euro in 1999 and all four blue lines clearly
demonstrate the euro shares rising from nearly zero to roughly 20 percent of the total, slightly less
than the share documented in mutual fund corporate bond holdings. The red lines capture the dollar
shares of syndicated loans to those four industries, and they all decline during that period, reaching
about 60 percent. During 2006-2008, the red lines begin their surges upward and the dollar’s
share of syndicated bank loans approaches 70 percent by the end of the sample. The blue lines
decline over this period as the euro shares return to levels below 20 percent. Our Online Appendix
additionally plots these patterns for agriculture, mining, and construction and transportation and
communication, as well as for the aggregate, which closely resembles the pattern in Figure 1.3
These patterns do not only emerge in mutual fund position and syndicated lending data. ECB
(2018) and Eren and Malamud (2018), for example, document a similar pattern using BIS data. Over
the last decade, use of the dollar to denominate globally traded assets has significantly expanded,
and it has done so at the cost of the euro.

II

Use in Denominating International Trade

Goldberg and Tille (2008) and Gopinath (2016) highlight the key role of the dollar in international
goods trade, even between country pairs not involving the United States.4 We analyze currency use
in international trade invoicing to see if we observe a rise in the dollar’s use and fall in the euro’s
3 We also in the Online Appendix plot this evolution for various regions of the world.

The global pattern is generated
in large part by European borrowers switching to borrow more in dollars, and by an expansion of total borrowing by
US corporations, which are more dollar intensive.
4 Gopinath and Stein (2018) and Chahrour and Valchev (2017) offer theories linking the outsized role of the dollar
in trade invoicing with its outsized role in denominating borrowing contracts.

use, similar to what we demonstrated above has occurred in their use to denominate assets. We
study the dataset analyzed in Ito and Kawai (2016), which is an updated version of that constructed
in Ito and Chinn (2015).5 We start our analysis in 1999, when the euro was introduced, and make
use of all subsequent data which extends, in many cases, to 2014.6
We regress the dollar and euro shares in imports or exports on time and country dummies:

this regression with equal weights, but in the Online Appendix we present the equivalent analyses

Interestingly, the pattern for imports is reminiscent of those described in Section I. The euro
5 We

are grateful to Hiro Ito for providing us with these data.

6 The sample is unbalanced, and often contains information on the currency share of invoicing of a country’s imports

but not of its exports (or vice-versa) and often contains information on the dollar share of trade invoicing but not the
euro share (and vice-versa). The data contain many missing years internal to the sample. We linearly interpolate for
such missing years, but we do not extrapolate before or after the earliest or latest available data points. The resulting
coverage from 1999 to 2014 is relatively stable and typically includes data for at least 30 countries.

share, after rising between 1999 and 2005 or so, mildly declines by 2014 whereas the dollar’s share
rises. The pattern is absent from exports, where the shares both increase slightly from 2005 on.7
These data join together a variety of sources that use differing methodologies. A particular
concern relates to EU countries, the data for which from the early 2000s are often sourced from
Kamps (2006), which likely includes currency shares calculated using data on trade with all
countries. Late in the sample, however, data for these countries often are sourced from Eurostat,
which generally reports currency shares excluding trade with EU partners. We cannot rule out,
therefore, that the growing dollar share of imports largely reflects differences across the sources
used for early and late periods of the sample.8
To deal with this concern, we exclude all reporting countries that are EU members – nearly 60
percent of the data – and plot with dashed lines in Figure 2 the resulting time fixed effects. These
dashed lines are much more stable, though the dollar shares do drift gently upward while the euro
shares are flat or very slightly declining during the last decade. The Online Appendix calculates
these trends using several alternate sources and specifications.
The time series patterns in the use of the dollar and euro to denominate international trades
are less stark than the patterns for their use in denominating assets. But across a large variety of
specifications, the dollar share almost always increases, though sometimes by only a small amount.
The euro share is more mixed, though is most often flat or declining. Ito and Chinn (2015) state
that, “The recent rise in the dollar share may reflect the effects of the global financial crisis and
the euro debt crisis ... the share of the euro by non-eurozone countries in both export and import
transactions was on a steadily rising trend until the mid-2000s, followed by a decline...” This is an
area fruitful for more measurement and research, but we find the evidence suggestive that the rise
of the dollar and fall of the euro indeed also applies to their roles in invoicing international trade.
7 In principle, global imports equal global exports, so differences in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) reflect the fact that the
data do not include all countries in the world and coverage of invoicing shares varies across the two directions of trade.
For example, neither the United States nor China are included in our data (the US data have only one datapoint and
there are no data for China). Exports from these large countries, therefore, show up in the imports of other countries
in Figure 2(a), but are absent from the export series in Figure 2(b).
8 In the Online Appendix we offer some simple calculations suggesting this issue is unlikely to explain the entire
change in invoicing shares of EU countries, both because the increasing dollar share of imports greatly exceeds the
declining euro share and because the equivalent pattern does not exist for exports.

Volume in Foreign Exchange Trading

An important feature of international currencies is their liquidity. While not obvious how best to
capture this aspect, data from the BIS Triennial Survey of FX trading demonstrate that the dollar’s
share of global foreign exchange trading volume, after a mild decline during the the early and mid
2000s, increased after the crisis, particularly relative to the euro.9

Table 1: Volume in Foreign Exchange Trading

Table 1 reports the volume of trading in the dollar and euro in levels and as a share of total FX
volume in the BIS survey. From 2001-2010 (data are not available for 2008 or 2009), the dollar’s
share of trading volume declined relative to the euro’s, with the ratio of dollar to euro volume
dropping from 2.4 in 2001 to 2.2 by 2010.10 The 2013 survey, however, revealed that dollar trading
volume grew 38 percent relative to 2010, while euro trading volume only grew by 15 percent.
Further, while dollar volume declined by 5 percent between 2013 and 2016, volume dropped more
than twice as much for euro trading. At the time of the most recent survey, therefore, dollar trading
volume had surged to equal 2.8 times that of euro trading, recovering from its 2010 low to a record
high level. To the extent that trading volume approximates liquidity, the dollar’s desirability on this
measure has also outpaced that of the euro over the last decade.
9 The data capture turnover, as reported to the BIS by sales desks of reporting dealers in as many as 53 jurisdictions,
of foreign exchange instruments in spot and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets.
10 From 2001 to 2016, the share of currencies other than the dollar and euro grew steadily from 36 to 41 percent.

Use as Central Bank Reserves

Historically, when private sector participation in cross-border asset trade was more muted, the
notion of what constituted an international currency was most closely tied to a currency’s role in
central bank reserves. An analysis of this role of international currencies yields a similar, though

Figure 3: Dollar and Euro Use In Central Bank Reserves
Figure 3 plots the share of the dollar and euro in central bank foreign reserve holdings since
1999, data obtained from the IMF’s COFER database. The combined share of the dollar and euro is
declining over this period as the use of other currencies as reserves, including the Chinese renminbi
and British pound, increased substantially over this period, climbing from about 11 to 17 percent
of the global total. Ignoring these other currencies, though, and comparing only the dollar and
the euro reveals a pattern very similar to those plotted in Figures 1 and 2 and described in Table 1
above.
Dollar reserves were 4.0 times as large as euro reserves in 1999, a ratio that steadily declined
until 2009, when the value of dollar reserves were only 2.2 times as large as the value of euro
reserves. Since then, dollar reserves grew slightly, while euro reserves declined by 27 percent. By

2017, central banks held 3.1 times as many dollars than euros as their foreign reserves.

V

Use as an Anchor or Reference Currency

As a final measure of the importance of the dollar and euro as international currencies, we explore
the extent to which they are chosen as the target for other countries that peg or manage their exchange
rates. Though the trend is slower moving and the changes are less dramatic, the classification of
anchor currencies in Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2017) paints a picture of increasing dollar use
and flat euro use consistent with our other findings above. At its inception in 1999, the euro served
as the anchor currency for 53 economies, roughly half of the number anchored to the dollar. By
2015, it dropped two countries while adding four more in Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Serbia.11
By contrast, only 5 countries that anchored to the dollar in 1999 were not also doing so in 2015
(including Latvia and Lithuania), while 19 countries that had not done so in 1999 were using the
dollar as their anchor currency in 2015.12 Indeed, a key conclusion of Ilzetzki et al. is that “the
dollar is as dominant today ... as it was at the time of the early Bretton Woods era.”

VI

Conclusion

By the early or mid 2000s, the dollar and euro both played significant roles as international
currencies. Both were commonly used to denominate internationally traded corporate bonds and
syndicated bank loans. Both commonly appeared on shipping manifests to denominate invoice
prices for international trades in goods and services. Both were among the currencies traded with
greatest volume on foreign exchange markets, preferred as reserves by central banks, and targeted by
managed exchange rate regimes. We document that since then, the dollar’s use has grown relative
11 Though other countries such as Greece adopted the euro during the intervening period, the classification algorithm

in Ilzetzki et al. (2017) considered Greece as anchoring to the euro in 1999, even before it formally adopted the currency.
12 These countries include Afghanistan, Angola, Belarus, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Liberia, Moldova, Malawi, Russia, Suriname, Tajikistan, Tonga, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
Some countries, such as Brazil and Ecuador, were considered to be “freely floating” in 1999 in the classification.

to the euro. The timing and magnitude of the shift varies, but the pattern is at least qualitatively
evident when studying all five of these roles of international currencies.
International currency use is often described as a very slow-moving phenomenon. It remains
poorly understood whether international currency would be expected to change simultaneously
across all of these roles, or if not, what the sequence of any such changes would be and why.
Nonetheless, we emphasize that our data demonstrate a meaningful shift away from the euro and
toward the dollar that has occurred, in many of these instances, over the relatively short span of a
decade. It is not only important to understand the implications for the global economy of the use
of an international currency, but it appears increasingly important to understand what determines
which currency the world choses.
