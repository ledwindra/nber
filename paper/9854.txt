ABSTRACT
During the Second World War, the American Pacific Coast experienced a tremendous
economic boom fueled by disproportionately large flows of military spending. Even before the
conflict’s end, fears spread that the region’s postwar economy would not provide sufficient jobs for
its greatly enlarged labor force. Responsible authorities predicted one million workers— onequarter of the labor force—would be unemployed one year after demobilization. But the conversion
experience over the 1945-49 period proved far easily than anticipated, a finding which this paper
attributes to strong “home market effects” highlighted in the new Economic Geography literature.
Based on an empirical investigation of the long-run relationship between manufacturing production
and the size of the Pacific region’s market, this study finds support for the views that the region’s
economic structure could support multiple equilibria and that the transitory shock of military
spending during World War II helped push the Pacific Coast economy from a “low-level”
equilibrium to a “higher-level” equilibrium consistent with the same fundamentals.

After the War Boom: Reconversion on the U.S. Pacific Coast, 1943-491

One of the most dramatic changes in twentieth-century American history was the
emergence of its Pacific Coast region as a core area of economic activity and innovation.
Between 1900 and 1980, the share of the Far Western states (Alaska, California, Hawaii,
Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) in national population more than quadrupled, rising
from about 3.2 percent to almost 15.5 percent. Its share of personal income more than
tripled, increasing from 5.3 percent to about 17.4 percent. By 1980, the leading urban
areas of the Pacific Coast of the United States– Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay
Area, and Seattle--gained worldwide recognition as centers of high technology.
Much of the traditional historiography treats the region’s experience during the
Second World War as the watershed event in its twentieth-century growth. For example,
Gerald Nash’s influential work argued that World War Two represented a fundamental
discontinuity in the West’s development and that wartime supply contracts and facility
investments were the driving forces in the Pacific state’s rapid transformation from an
stagnating economic “colony” of the industrial Northeast into a dynamic pace-setting
region.2
There has been little or no argument that the West experienced disproportionately
rapid expansion during the early 1940s. Indeed contemporary observers referred to the
wartime boom as the region’s “Second Gold Rush.”

Civilians migrated west in

unprecedented numbers to fill jobs in the region's burgeoning aircraft and shipbuilding
industries. In addition, military facilities in the region were home-base for thousands of
soldiers and sailors engaged in the Pacific campaign. Between 1940 and 1945, the
region’s total population increased by 2.7 million persons, or by over one-quarter. Nor is

there much disagreement that the “engine of growth” was military spending. Between
June 1940 and June 1945, the Far Western states received about $27 billion in federal
government spending for war supply contracts and facility investments. This accounted
for close to one-eighth of the national total, roughly twice the region’s pre-war share in
population or manufacturing employment.
Yet there has emerged a vigorous debate about whether the Second World War
represented as a fundamental discontinuity as the Nash thesis suggests.3 Recent studies
have pointed to evidence of stability in the region’s political and economic structure and
to the roots of the region’s wartime growth in its pre-war economic development. This
paper attempts to advance and, in important ways, move beyond the continuity vs.
discontinuity debate by examining the Pacific Coast’s economic experience in the
immediate post-war period (1945-49). I argue here that the conversion process, which
has been unduly neglected in the recent debate, was crucial for region’s consolidation of
the transitory gains during the war into permanently higher levels of economic activity.
After military spending peaked in 1943, fears spread throughout the West that the
region’s postwar economy would not provide sufficient jobs for its greatly enlarged labor
force. Serious economic disruptions were widely foreseen. In California, responsible
authorities estimated that one million workers—about one-quarter of the labor force—would be unemployed one year after demobilization. In response to these challenges,
public agencies such as the California State Reconstruction and Reemployment
Commission sought to plan for orderly conversion to a peacetime economy. In addition,
business groups and local officials lobbied the federal government and eastern firms to
keep the West's new steel complex and other “war winnings” in operation.
The transition did not prove as difficult as most observers had anticipated. The
region’s unemployment rate in the immediate post-war period generally remained in
single digits and the expected out-migration did not occur. Instead, the enlarged western
market induced a rapid inflow of new branches of national manufacturing firms, a
vigorous expansion of existing operations, and a dramatic surge in the formation of

View,” pp. 363-92, in this collection.

small-scale, local startups. Many war workers and plants shifted quickly to supply
civilian markets. The demands for housing, schools, and services, left unfilled during the
war, fostered vigorous job growth in construction, trade, and other services. By 1950, the
Pacific Coast's employment structure had largely returned to its pre-war composition,
although on a significantly larger scale.
Drawing inspiration from the New Economic Geography literature, as well as
from the traditional historiography of the West, the paper argues that strong “home
market effects” account for the relatively easy conversion experience on the Pacific
Coast.

Based on an empirical investigation of the long-run relationship between

manufacturing production and the size of the region’s market, this study finds surprising
support for the highly speculative claims that the region’s economic structure could
support multiple equilibria and that the transitory shock of military spending during
World War II helped push the Pacific Coast economy from a “low-level” equilibrium to a
“higher-level” equilibrium consistent with the same fundamentals.
This paper has the following form: the next section briefly examines the nature
and effects of the war boom on the West Coast economy. Section 3 discusses local
conversion planning efforts, with a focus on wartime expectations about the post-war size
of the Pacific Coast population, migration flows, employment levels, and unemployment
rates. The following section details how the actual post-war experience unfolded and
explores how the expansion of the home market made the transition easier than
anticipated. Section 5 uses a new data set on California manufacturing to put the WWII
episode into historical context by examining the long-run relationship between the
growth of the region’s industrial output and the size of the local market. The final section
concludes.

The War Boom
There is no question that World War Two created an intense economic boom on
the US Pacific Coast. As Table 1 shows, the federal government spent about $23.5
billion in major war supply contracts and $3.5 billion for military and industrial facilities
in the region between June 1940 and June 1945. California led the way, receiving $19.7
billion or nearly three-quarters of the region’s total expenditures.4 The West Coast's
share of national military spending, 11.8 percent, well exceeded its 1940 share of the
nation's resident population, 6.5 percent, and its 1939 share of the nation's manufacturing
wage-earners, 5.3 percent. But it is important to note that most of the wartime contracts
were for aircraft (roughly $12 billion) and ships (about $9 billion), activities in which the
region demonstrated significant comparative advantages before the attack on Pearl
Harbor.5
The wartime boom led to a 61 percent increase in non-agricultural civilian
employment on the Pacific Coast between 1940 and 1944. Table 2 offers a picture of the
employment trends in the region as a whole and in its largest state, California. The
expansion of the manufacturing sector drove job growth in the region. The construction
and government sectors tended to keep pace with the overall expansion; most other
sectors grew in absolute but not relative terms. During the war, the region’s
manufacturing sector added about one million workers as employment increased from
623 thousand workers in the 1939-40 period to 1,615 thousand in the 1943-44 period.
This two-and-one-half fold increase in manufacturing employment accounted for over 60
percent of the overall expansion of non-agricultural employment.6
Driving this enormous growth in western manufacturing was the military’s high
demands for the products of the region’s aircraft and shipbuilding industries. During the

declined.

war, Pacific Coast aircraft plants produced 38 percent of the nation’s planes; its shipyards
built 44 percent of the government’s merchant ships.7 To meet the military’s demands,
employment in West Coast shipyards soared from less than 7 thousand in 1939 to over
515 thousand at the peak in the summer of 1943.8 The number of workers in the region’s
aircraft plants climbed from about 25 thousand in 1939 to about 315 thousand in the
summer of 1943.

Together these sectors accounted for about one-half of the total

expansion of non-agricultural employment in the Pacific region between 1940 and 1943.
Associated with the enormous growth of these high-wage “war industries” were increases
in the region’s wages relative to the country as a whole. For example, the hourly wage in
California manufacturing rose from 114.9 percent of the national average in the 1939-41
period to 120.7 percent in the 1943-45 period.9
The expansion of employment opportunities resulted in dramatic reductions in
unemployment, substantial increases in labor force participation, especially of women,
and significant inflows of population. The region’s jobless rate, which languished at
double-digit levels on the eve of the war, fell to a less than one percent by 1944.
Unfortunately we lack comprehensive monthly data of the level and rate of
unemployment in the Pacific Northwest during the war years, but the high-quality series
available for California (displayed in Figure 1) can serve as a useful proxy for
movements in the region as a whole.10 As the Figure shows, the state’s unemployment
rate fell from 15.2 percent in January 1940 to 8.1 percent in December 1941, and to the

8 Officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco noted: “More than any other industry,
shipbuilding has been responsible for the vast increase in population and employment on the Pacific Coast
since 1940, and its demand for materials and supplies has been the principal factor responsible for the rapid
expansion and development of the heavy metals and metal working industries in the (12th) District.”

10 Annual data on the unemployment rate in Washington State indicate that the unemployment rate fell
from 14.7 percent in 1940 to 2.5 percent during the 1943/44 period. In the latter period, fewer than 20
thousand were unemployed. Pacific Northwest Business (Sept. 1955): 28-31. Evidence for Oregon reveal
that the unemployment rate fell from 14.0 percent in March 1940 to 1.5 percent in June 1943. At the latter
date, there were only 9 thousand unemployed out of a labor force of 602.5 thousand. Oregon State,

incredibly low rate of 0.3 percent in October 1943. This meant that out of a labor force of
3908 thousand workers, only 12 thousand were without jobs. The region’s labor market
became so tight that the war authorities declared Los Angeles, Portland-Vancouver, San
Diego, San Francisco-Oakland, and Seattle-Tacoma “congested production areas” and
placed restrictions on new procurement activity.11
Well before the market became this tight, western employers sought out new
sources of labor. Migrants from the Dust Bowl, who has been unwelcome in the 1930s,
were now actively recruited.12 Housewives, students, retirees, and others discouraged
from work by a decade of depression, were drawn into the labor force. These forces
more than offset the region's losses due to military enlistment and conscription.
According to estimates from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total labor force on
the Pacific Coast (including the armed forces) rose from about 4,268 thousand in April
1940 to 5,859 thousand in April 1945, an increase of 37.3 percent. This compares with a
national gain of 20.5 percent. Of the 1,591 thousand added workers, natural increase
accounted for only 92 thousand workers or about 6 percent; the participation of “extra
workers” added 652 thousand, about 41 percent of the total. Interstate migration made up
53 percent of the increase, some 847 thousand workers. Of this number, an increase of
410 thousand would have been expected if interstate migration over the 1940-45 period
maintained its 1935-40 volume.

The Bureau concluded that “abnormal” migration

accounted for 437 thousand added workers (or about 27 percent of the labor force
growth). Most of the wartime interstate migrants came from the West North Central (32
percent), West South Central (20 percent), and Mountain (20 percent) regions, where the
expansion of economic opportunities did not keep pace with the Pacific region.13
As a result of this surge in migration, World War Two was a period of vigorous
population growth on the Pacific Coast. Between July 1940 and July 1945, the region’s
civilian population expanded from 9,678 thousand to nearly 11,300 thousand residents.

The total increase in the civilian population actually understates the migration flow
because these figure ignore the withdrawn of the region’s residents into military service.
Net in-migration to the region totaled almost two million people (1984 thousand) over the
1940-45 period. At the peak, more than six hundred thousand people moved to the
Pacific Coast each year.14
When the war ended, the region’s population and labor force were significantly
larger than before. In addition, millions of footloose servicemen and women awaited
demobilization. But the region’s industrial structure, expanded in such a rapid and
unbalanced matter during the war, faced serious problems of reconversion. The leading
question of the day was “Where will all these people find jobs if they stay in the West?”

Contemporary Expectations
Western business, labor, and political leaders became highly concerned about the
region’s post-war prospects. In part, this reflected the nationwide apprehension that the
depressed conditions of the 1930s would return. But the local leaders had additional
reasons to worry. The war boom had attracted so many new workers, workers without
strong roots in the region, workers with a history of moving on. If jobs were unavailable
in the post-war period, these migrants might either return home or, if they remained,
become public charges.
In addition, the war boom had been so highly unbalanced with most of the
expansion occurring in a few sectors—aircraft and shipbuilding—that were bound to
contract sharply once the War was over. As local observers often noted, “reconversion”
was a misnomer on the West Coast.

Many of the Pacific Coast factories had not

converted from peacetime production to contribute to the war effort but had been
constructed as the conflict raged. When the war has over, these plants would either begin
to compete in the civilian market for the first time or shut down. Adding to these
concerns was the possibility that victory in Europe might precede victory in Japan by

many months or even years and that the West Coast would remain on a war footing long
after “normalcy” prevailed in the rest of the nation. Manufacturers in the East and
Midwest would then be able to capture the post-war civilian markets before the western
plants had a chance to convert.
The region began to prepare for peace well before the war was won. In 1943, the
California legislature established the State Reconstruction and Re-employment
Commission to:
develop the natural, social, and economic resources of the State, promote development of
new industries, create new markets; promote the reemployment of discharged
servicemen and readjustment to displaced war workers, and the conversion of industry
and commerce from war to peace standards; to provide for post-war adjustment and
reconstruction, and to encourage economic and social improvement of the general
public.15

In the Pacific Northwest, the strong regional planning staffs, set up during the New Deal,
were themselves converted to plan for post-war development.16 The staff of the 12th
District Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco also lent a hand to the conversion effort.
Up and down the coast, business, academic, and government organizations began
to sample, survey, plan, and predict. Among the key issues was how large the region’s
post-war population and labor force be. To answer this and other questions, the planners
wanted to know how many of the recent entrants into the labor market would remain and
how many veterans would return. As an example, in early 1944 the Kaiser interests
conducted a massive survey in the Portland area, drawing responses from over 80
thousand war workers. They found that about 52 percent of the respondents who had
migrated with the previous three years intended to remain in the area after the war. Of
these, about 41 percent were definite in their intention to stay and another 59 percent
intended to stay if they found work. Based on this study, Emory Worth of the Oregon
State Manpower Commission estimated that roughly 40 thousand in-migrant workers,
representing about one-eighth of the 1944 labor force, would remain in the Portland-

Glossing the numerous surveys conducted in

Washington State, Nathaniel Engle found that “about half” of incoming war workers
“definitely want to remain in the State” and that between 44 and 48 percent of working
women expected to drop out of the labor force after the war.18 Adding the state’s 115
thousand returning veterans, he estimated that Washington’s post-war labor force would
be larger by 339 thousand workers, or by 36 percent, than in 1939.
California authorities were both confident and concerned that the Golden State
would keep a larger share of its recent migrants.

The State Reconstruction and

Reemployment Commission declared in early 1944 that “(i)n no event is the State
expected to lose even temporarily more than one-quarter to one-fifth of its wartime
migrants, while a net population loss by 1950 is considered highly unlikely.”19 They
estimated that in “194X” – the first year after demobilization—California’s population
would be between 8,330 and 8,750 thousand and that in 1950 the state would likely have
a population of 8,500 to 9,000 thousand.20 O. Wheeler, director of research at the 12th
District of the Federal Reserve Bank, summarized the prospects of the West as follows:
“well over half of the in-migrants intend to remain in the region, at least if they can find
jobs…A third or more of the former housewives apparently wish to continue working.”21
In early 1945, authorities on the coast received more worrying news—not only
did their own veterans plan to return, but unexpectedly large numbers of veterans from
other states hoped to join them. The news came from a US Army study of the post-war
migration plans of enlisted men conducted in the summer of 1944. Most enlisted men

nation-wide (82.7 percent) stated they intended to return to the region from which they
came; four-fifths said they would return to the same state. In the national sample, 10.8
percent were undecided about where to locate and 6.5 percent planned to return to a
different division from their prewar residence. Of this 6.5 percent, over one-quarter
stated they intended to move to the West Coast. This was a greater share of movers than
any other region attracted. Reinforcing this westward flow was the fact that enlisted men
from the Pacific region were more likely than those from any other region to be
“homeward-bound.” Nearly nine-out-of-ten intended to return to the West Coast and
only 3.6 percent planned to move away. According to the authors of the study, the net
effect of the movement of servicemen would be “a rapid expansion in the Pacific coast
states.”22
This news gave greater impetus to local efforts to gauge the extent of employment
and unemployment during the conversion period. The conventional wisdom was that
employment in the “war industries” would fall to less than one-tenth of its wartime peak.
For example, a 1944 study of Pacific Coast shipyards by the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco indicated that the region’s shipbuilders expected to have 40 thousand
employees in an “ordinary year with good business” and only 16 thousand in an
“ordinary year with bad business.”23

In 1943, the sector employed 515 thousand

workers, implying that roughly one-half million workers would be laid off in the
conversion process.24
In combination with the Committee for Economic Development, the Bank
conducted a more comprehensive survey of Pacific Coast manufacturing firms regarding

22 Abram J. Jaffe and Seymour L. Wolfbein, “Postwar Migration Plans of Army Enlisted Men,” Annals of
the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 238 (March 1945): 18-26. The veterans were
presumably more footloose than most other members of the US population. They were generally in the age
categories associated with higher levels of geographic mobility, had already been detached from their
family’s traditional home, and had acquired federally subsidized access to housing markets and educational
institutions nationwide through the 1944 Servicemen’s Readjustment Bill (the GI Bill).
23 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Monthly Review (Dec. 1944): 64. The estimates for post-war
employment even under bad conditions were above the 1939 level of 6.5 thousand workers in the West
Coast yards.
24 Actually, many workers, understanding the industry’s limited post-war prospects, “left early” to seek
other employment opportunities. These departures and difficulties in attracting workers to the industry’s
dead-end jobs added to the shipbuilders’ problems of completing work during the war.
11

their “postwar intentions” in the spring and summer of 1944.25 They asked how much
employment the firms were currently providing and how much they would offer in the
postwar period under “good economic conditions” and under “bad conditions.” These
findings are summarized in Table 3. Overall, the region’s manufacturing firms expected
to employ around 780 thousand workers if times were “good” and about 500 thousand if
times were “bad.”

The former represented an increase of about 40 percent from the

actual 1939 level of employment, but a reduction by one-half from the 1943 peak. The
latter figure was below even the pre-war level. Manufacturers in Oregon and Washington
appeared more optimistic than those in California.

The most notable sign of this

difference was that the manufacturers outside of the aircraft and shipbuilding industries in
the Pacific Northwest expected that under “good conditions” they would hire more
workers than they did in 1943 whereas those in California expected their employment to
decline.
The California State Reconstruction and Re-employment Commission painted an
even more pessimistic picture of the state’s post-war prospects. It estimated the civilian
labor force in “194X” would be between 3,600 and 4,000 thousand workers. With “the
smoothest readjustment and the highest possible levels of business activity,” there would
be 3,200 thousand civilian jobs within a year of demobilization, but with moderately
adverse conditions, only 2,800 thousand jobs. In any case, employment would be below
the 1943 peak of 3,500 thousand jobs and it would take three or four years of normal
growth to recover to this level. According to a Commission report published in late
1944, unemployment in “194X” California would range between 365 and 1,200
thousand, with the most likely prospect between 450 and 800 thousand workers.26
As the war progressed, responsible authorities in the state became still more
pessimistic about the extent of unemployment. In 1945, Samuel May, Director of the
Bureau of Public Administration at the University of California, estimated that total
unemployment in California at the end of the first year of demobilization (assumed in his

Review (Feb. 1945): 17-20. As the Fed economists noted the survey covered only existing firms and,
therefore, missed any increase in activity planned by potential new entrants.

study to be 1946-47) would range between 905 and 1,085 thousand, levels he found
“startling.”

The main reason for the difference from the State Reconstruction and

Reemployment Commission figures was that 200 to 350 thousand veterans from other
states were now expected to move to California after the war. May anticipated that the
state’s labor force would be higher than in 1943 by 670 thousand workers and
employment lower by 315 to 490 thousand. Overall, California employment would be in
the range of 2,955 to 3,130 thousand workers, implying about one-quarter of the labor
force would unemployed.27

The Post-War Experience
What actually happened after the war? How did the experts’ predictions measure
up? As revealed in the data in Table 2 above, the region’s readjustment proved far easier
than most of the responsible authorities predicted. Contemporary observers were stuck
by two phenomena: (1) overall employment recovered so rapidly–as a writer at the
Federal Reserve Bank put it in mid-1946 the region experienced a loss of 45 percent of its
manufacturing jobs “without collapsing or, indeed, showing any signs of distress”; and
(2) the employment structure at a broad (1-digit SIC) level almost immediately returned
to its pre-war composition—repeating a common refrain, a 1948 Federal Reserve article
noted: “the distribution of workers among major industry groups is now not markedly
different than before the war.

Little trace remains of the wartime pattern of

employment.”28
As many contemporaries noted, the adjustment process began before the conflict
ended with employment in the “war industries” falling gradually from 1943-44 on.
27 A second, later set of estimates by May’s organization put the expected number of jobless Californians
in mid-1946 in a range between 826 to 1256 thousand workers. These estimates were made independently
by an industrial engineer, Alfred Norris, as a check on May’s figures. The differences from the estimates
of May and the State Reconstruction and Reemployment Commission were chiefly due to greater estimated
flows of returning veterans, which resulted in higher labor force numbers (4004-4157 thousand) than the
earlier studies. US Senate, Hearings Before the Special Committee to Study and Survey Problems of

Nonetheless, the cutbacks after VJ-day hit the West Coast hard. In the four week period
after 15 August 1945, more than 300 thousand workers lost their jobs. Most of the
decline resulted from the termination of about 100 thousand shipyard workers (out of 385
thousand employed) and 75 thousand aircraft worker (out of an initial employment of 185
thousand). Over the next six weeks, another 100 thousand workers were laid off, again
mostly in the high-paying “war industries.” By the end of 1945, total employment in the
region’s aircraft and shipbuilding industries fell to about 280 thousand, down from 750
thousand at the start on the year.29
Unemployment started to climb. By February 1946, the jobless rate in California
entered double-digits for the first time since 1941 (See Figure 1). But the situation
quickly improved. Both the number of unemployed persons (485 thousand) and the
jobless rate (11.6 percent) peaked in April 1946. By summer, the state’s unemployment
rate again dropped into single-digit levels and remained in the 5-8 percent range until the
1949-50 recession. I have found comparable monthly figures for unemployment rates in
Oregon over the immediate post-war period (which are included in Figure 1) but
unfortunately none for Washington state.30 The available information suggests that the
unemployment rate in the Pacific Northwest was slightly higher than in California in the
last years of the war and was typically slightly lower in the late 1940s. Estimates of
unemployment in the three Pacific Coast states from the US Employment Service
indicate that the number of unemployed in the region peaked at 725 thousand in March
1946 and fell to about 600 thousand by May. The latter approximately matched the prewar (April 1940) level when the labor force was about one-third smaller. Obviously
unemployment in the conversion period was substantially higher than the wartime low of
around 100 thousand (in 1943-44) and the region’s unemployment rate remained several
percentage points higher than the national average. But joblessness in the post-war
period was far below expectations and never threatened to bankrupt the region’s
unemployment compensation systems as had been feared.31

One reason that unemployment was not higher was that the inflow of out-of-state
veterans to the West proved to be smaller than most of the wartime studies had predicted.
In 1947, the Current Population Survey estimated that about 1,301 thousand WWII-era
veterans lived in the Pacific region, only about 80 thousand more than resided there prior
to entry into active service.32 The region continued to receive a positive, albeit smaller,
inflow of migrants. Between July 1, 1945 and July 1, 1947, the civilian population of the
Pacific Coast increased from 11,700 thousand to 13,551 thousand. Of this increase,
migration accounted for about 342 thousand. The post-war surge in family formation
caused the rates of natural increase in the Far West to reach unprecedented levels. The
surplus of births over deaths accounts for over four-fifths of the region’s population
growth.
Overall, non-agricultural employment in the three Pacific Coast states fell by 290
thousand workers, or about 7 percent, between 1944 and 1946. But the 1946 level was
still 50 percent above the 1940 level. Most of the decline appears to be due to the
voluntary withdrawal of the “extra workers”—housewives, students, and retirees—from
the labor market. The decline, moreover, was only temporary. By 1950, non-agricultural
employment in the region surpassed even the wartime peak.
How could the Pacific Coast’s economy sustain its greatly enlarged labor force
and population after the war? It is useful to frame the issue in a simple demand and
supply model of the labor market. During the Second World War, the Pacific Coast
experienced a dramatic shift out in labor demand in its “war industries”, which led to the
expansion of its labor force. After 1943, the military demands began to diminish, but
employment did not fall as much as predicted. Why did the wartime reallocation of
aggregate income and employment “stick”? There are several possible explanations and I
would not like to fall into the trap of insisting that only one is valid.33
32 US Census Bureau, Estimated Number of Veterans of World War II In Continental United States by
States, April 1, 1947 Current Population Survey, P25, No.5. Note that given the large migration flows of
the early 1940s, many of those entering the service in the Pacific states had resided in other regions at the
time of the 1940 Census.
33 Neither 1939-40 nor 1943-44 were periods sustaining long-run full-employment equilibrium in the labor
market. The 1939 economy was arguably operating at far less than full capacity due to deficient aggregate
demand. Perhaps the best indication of the accuracy of this characterization is how rapidly output
increased and unemployment fell once the wartime demand kicked in. Another interesting sign about the
state of the pre-war labor markets is how they responded to the increases in military demands, which were
15

One possible explanation is that the wartime stimulus did not really end. The
emergence and growth of the military-industrial complex during the Cold War period is a
familiar theme in the economic history of the recent past. It is well understood that over
the second half of the twentieth century, military procurement became geographically
concentrated in the so-called “Gun-Belt” along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts.34
That said, it is important to note that military spending declined sharply after World War
II as Figure 2 displays. By 1945, real expenditures for defense expenditures reached the
unprecedented and, indeed, probably unsustainable sum of $139 billion (in 1958 dollars).
Between 1945 and 1948, US military spending contracted by $127.6 billion or 92
percent. (By way of contrast, the post-Cold War defense contraction from 1989 to 1996
was only 29 percent; even in absolute terms, the recent drop of $20.9 billion was dwarfed
by the 1945-48 decline.) While data on the regional allocation of defense spending for
the 1946-50 period are not readily available, it is absolutely certain than spending in the
Pacific region was far lower than at the wartime peak.
A reading of the West Coast business press in the immediate post-war period
reveals that virtually no one considered military spending a suitable permanent
foundation for the region’s economy. While there were expressions of concern that the
post-war contraction was too rapid, most business writers placed their faith in the private
sector.

To the extent that the local business community demanded government

intervention, it was to combat freight rate discrimination, to help establish western basing
points for steel prices, and to sell off war surplus facilities in an orderly manner. Nothing
in the experience of West's business leaders suggested that the region’s long-term
economic growth could be based on military sales and few realized that defense demand
would remain permanently higher until the beginning of the Korean conflict.
primarily for durable manufactured goods. The so-called war industries typically saw large increases in
employment but smaller relative increases in wages than the so-called non-war industries. The existence of
a pool of underemployed labor (particularly in the rural areas on the West Central region) during the prewar period also helps explain the high degree of responsiveness of migrants to the job opportunities
opening on the Pacific Coast during the war. The 1943-44 peak was not the ideal candidate for a period of
long-run equilibrium either. By this point, the War Labor Board imposed restrictions on how high wages
could be increased. Even earlier, plant allocation decisions and materials controls led to the contraction of
activity in many activities.
34 As late as 1996, the Pacific region received 21.6 percent of the DOD Contract Awards and 21.6 percent
of military payrolls, which was disproportionately larger than its share on national economic activity.

16

Between 1945 and 1947, the region’s aircraft industry suffered a severe
contraction but soon activity stabilized at a level far above pre-war production. By 1948,
the Pacific Coast industry was already in the black, owing to a resumption of military
orders and successful reconversion of a part of the industry to civilian production. One
important trend accompanying the post-war contraction of the aircraft industry was its reconcentration on the West Coast. A glimpse of this process is offered in Table 4, which
shows the floor-space of airframe place in 1940, 1944, and 1948. Before Pearl Harbor
roughly one-half of the floor-space was on the West Coast. During the War, the military
authorities induced the leading West Coast firms to build and operate large plants in the
mid-continent region.

Although the share of national aircraft floor-space (and

production) located on the West Coast fell to about one-quarter, the share “managed” by
West Coast firms remained roughly constant. After the war, the West Coast firms shut
down almost all of their mid-continent branch plants and the West Coast share climbed
back to about one-half of the national total.
By way of contrast to the aircraft industry, Pacific Coast shipbuilding virtually
collapsed after VJ day (see Figure 3). By early 1947, the region’s private and navy yards
split evenly the sector’s labor force of 65 thousand workers. For several years after mid1947, industry received no orders for new ships and performed only repair work. By
early 1950, employment had fallen to about 32 thousand.

Although the industry

recovered slightly during the Korean conflict, Pacific Coast shipyard activity never again
approached one-tenth of the 1943-44 levels.35 In summary, military demand in the
immediate post-war period, while higher than before the war, was far below the wartime
peak.
A second alternative explanation for the continued high employment level is that
migration is costly. Once people had made the investment to move west in response to
the wartime boom, they would not automatically move back home when the boom ended.
The elasticity of labor supply in response to the expansion of demand was higher than
that in response to the contraction, implying the temporary boom had a ratchet effect on

the Gunbelt: the Military Remapping of Industrial America ( New York : Oxford University Press, 1991).

17

the region’s labor force. This argument has some plausibility. But in combination with a
decline in labor demand in the “war industries,” it implies that relative wages would have
to fall dramatically to sustain employment. The available evidence suggests regional
wages did decline, but the movements were surprisingly mild.

In California, for

example, the hourly manufacturing wage fell from 120.7 of the national average in the
1943-45 period to 114.0 in the 1947-49 period. The latter figure was 0.8 percentage
points below the ratio prevailing in the 1939-41 period. Given the conventional estimates
of own-price elasticity of demand for labor (say –0.75), this change would account for
only a trivial fraction of the relative increase in the state’s employment, holding the labor
demand constant.36
The complete explanation must then include an increase in relative labor demand
from a source other than the military. It could be due to an increase in demand for the
region’s exports, which included principally agricultural and wood products and
nonferrous metals. But between 1943 and 1946, aggregate employment in these activities
actually declined in both California and the Pacific Northwest.
The second and more promising candidate for an expansion of demand was the
region’s home market. The wartime boom had increased the real income on the Pacific
Coast by almost 77 percent between 1940 and 1945. The region’s share of national
income rose from 9.7 percent to 11.9 percent and its share of national population rose
from 7.4 percent to 8.9 percent.37 But the wartime controls and labor market conditions
slowed economic adjustments to meet the enlarged civilian demands.
The robust growth of the national economy in the immediate post-war period is
commonly attributed to pent-up demand, to the combination of large levels of private
savings built up during the war and of small existing stocks of consumer durables and
housing following a decade-and-a-half of limited purchases. By most measures, pent-up
demand on the West Coast was especially intense. During the early 1940s, the region’s
per capita income became the highest in the nation, contributing to the rapid
accumulation of liquid assets. For example, per capita sales of war bonds on the Pacific

Economics: Theory and Public Policy 4th Ed. (New York: Harper Collins, 1991) p. 117

Coast were consistently 25-30 percent higher than the national average. Between 1941
and 1945, the region’s residents purchased over $4.5 billion Series E Savings Bonds,
accounting for about 11.6 percent of national sales. Other forms of liquid savings also
rose dramatically over the war. Between the end of 1939 and the end of 1945, bank
deposits on the Pacific Coast rose from $5.2 billion (7.6 percent of the national total) to
$17.0 billion (10.3 percent).38 When this spending power was released, a tremendous
boom resulted.39
Despite the huge flows of migrants, civilian construction virtually stopped on the
West Coast in the war years. By 1943-44, acute housing shortages appeared in most of
the leading urban centers.

Indeed, as authorities noted, the question of where the

enlarged population would find homes in the post-war West was second only to the
question of where they would find jobs. When construction controls were lifted after
mid-1945, the region enjoyed an extremely vigorous residential construction boom. Table
5 displays the real value of authorized construction in urban areas on the Pacific Coast
from 1943 to 1950. As it shows, real construction spending in 1947-48 as roughly three
times the 1943-44 level. And as Table 2 reveals, over the 1944-48 period, the building

Indicators, 1939-46, Economics Series. No. 67 (Washington, DC: GPO 1948): 36-38.
39 The recent work of Robert Higgs serves as a useful corrective to the view that the consumption boom
was literally based on dissaving, on spending down savings accumulated during the war. See Robert
Higgs, “From Central Planning to the Market: The American Transition, 1945-1947.” Journal of Economic
History 59(3), (Sept. 1999): 600-623. As Higgs noted, the aggregate national saving rate during the
conversion period (1946-47) always remained positive, even if lower than during the war. But to my mind,
this does not entirely refute the conventional wisdom that wartime savings helped fuel the post-war boom.
In 1939, the typical US household presumably possessed stocks of liquid assets, consumer durables, and
residential capital far below their equilibrium levels due to the previous decade of depressed incomes and
financial collapse. With the wartime combination of rising earnings, production controls, and rationing of
consumer goods, their stocks of liquid assets recovered much faster than their stocks of consumer durables
and housing. In the absence of this accumulation of liquid assets, households presumably would have
saved more and spent less in 1946 than they did. We know many households did dissave during the
conversion period; according the Federal Reserve Board study “more than two-fifths” of US families
reported decreases in liquid assets in 1946. (US Council of Economic Advisors, Midyear Economic Report
of the President, July 21, 1947 (Washington, DC: GPO, 1947) p. 18.) More probably would have done so
but for the gray markets limiting the availability of automobiles and other consumer durables.
Overall, Higgs has a negative assessment of the war’s effects on economic activity. See Robert
Higgs, “Wartime Prosperity? A Reassessment of the U.S. Economy in the 1940s,” Journal of Economic
History 52(1), (March 1992): 41-60. It is beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate the validity of this
perspective at the national level, but I will note the underlying conception framework appears to exclude
scale effects highlighted in the new literatures on economic growth and geography. Such scale effects
create the possibility that the wartime stimulus push a regional economy to a new equilibrium.

sector added 92 thousand employees in the Pacific region as a whole, almost all in
California.
Even larger and more immediate changes occurred in the trade and service
sectors. These activities had not kept pace with the expansion during the war. Indeed,
many small retail and wholesale establishments closed because of materials and labor
shortages. For example, in California the number of retail stores licensed by the state (to
collect sales taxes) declined from 250 thousand in 1940 to under 174 thousand in 1943.
After the war peak, the number bounced back, increasing to 251 thousand in 1946 to 278
thousand in 1948.40 In Washington State, it was reported that 1500 trade establishments
per month were started in the late 1945 and early 1946. Again referring to Table 2, the
West Coast trade sector added nearly 238 thousand jobs between 1944 and 1948 and the
service sector (including Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) nearly 138 thousand. The
bulk of these increases occurred in California where employment in the trade expanded
by 177 thousand and that in services by 108 thousand.41
Finally although employment in the manufacturing sector fell sharply in 1945-46,
almost all of the contraction was in shipbuilding and aircraft. Many of the other so-called
“war industries” such as chemicals, petroleum, rubber tires, and automobiles recovered
quickly after their initial cutbacks. And the growth in the “non-war industries” offset the
decline in the “war industries” to a far greater extent than was expected. Table 6 presents
data on the number of production workers on the Pacific Coast by major industry group
for 1939, 1947, and 1950.

As it shows, even excluding aircraft and shipbuilding,

manufacturing employment on the West Coast increased by almost 70 percent between
1939 and 1947. The industrial groups typically associated with larger scale (SIC 28-30,
33-38) generally experienced faster growth.
Most contemporaries placed special emphasis on the growth of large-scale basic
industries. Indeed, the establishment of the West’s first modern integrated steel plants at
Fontana, CA and Geneva, UT were widely considered the region’s major “war
winnings.” But it is important to observe how broadly based the expansion was. Jane

highlights the vital role that the diverse array of small and medium-size startup firms
played in the region’s reconversion:
.…new enterprises started in corners of old loft buildings, in Quonset huts and in
backyard garages. But they multiplied swiftly, mostly by the breakaway method. And
many grew swiftly. They poured forth furnaces, sliding doors, mechanical saws, shoes,
bathing suits, underwear, china, furniture, cameras, hand tools, hospital equipment,
scientific instruments, engineering services and hundred of other things. One-eighth of
all the new business started in the United States during the latter half of the 1940s were
started in Los Angeles.42

My examination of the federal government figures suggests the latter statistic is
somewhat exaggerated. Nonetheless, the surge in business formation on the Pacific
Coast during the immediate post-WWII period was highly impressive, as the evidence in
Tables 7 and 8 reveal. Table 7 presents statistics, constructed by the US Office of
Business Economics based on the payroll tax records of the Bureau of Old-Age and
Survivors Insurance, on the population and composition on business firms in operation.
Table 8 adds information on the number and rates of new entries, exits, and transfers over
the 1945-50 period for the Pacific Coast, California, and the United States as a whole.
The data on the aggregate number of firms show that the business population on the
Pacific Coast increased by almost one-half between 1945 and 1950 compared with a rise
by one-third nationally. The Far West’s expansion was both deep and wide; in every
sector, the proportional increase was greater on the Pacific Coast than in the nation as a
whole.

The growth of the number of western firms was most rapid in contract

construction (2.56 times), followed by wholesale trade (1.67), manufacturing (1.46) and
retail trade (1.44), service (1.36), and all other industries (1.19). Indeed, the Office of
Business Economics study indicates that the rate of new business entry in the West
outpaced that in every other region of the country.

And while it appears that Jacobs’

statement that Los Angeles accounted for one-eighth of the nation’s startups is off, the
Pacific Coast as a whole exceeded this share. Most of these new firms obviously started
small, and many “failed.” (Rates of exits and business transfers on the Pacific Coast
were also substantially higher than the national averages, and whereas entry rates

21

generally declined over the late 1940s, exit rates rose.)43 Finally, it is important to note
that, as the recent New Economic Growth literature serves to emphasize, the extent of the
local market can matter importantly for growth even when firm sizes are small.
At a conceptual level, we may distinguish three ways--called here “multiplier,”
“accelerator,” and “threshold” effects--in which local production may depend on the local
market. In the first, based on the familiar “multiplier” mechanism of macroeconomics,
the level of local production increases roughly proportionately with the size of local
income or population. This relationship appears to characterize trade, much of the
service sector, and manufacturing activities such as printing or the processing of
perishable foods. In proximate terms, the “multiplier” relationship probably explains
most of the expansion of the Pacific Coast economy after the war. But such growth is
“passive” or “induced” and, from first principles, cannot account for the entire increase or
explain its fundamental cause.
The second effect, based on the accelerator principle, recognizes that for some
activities the size of local demand depends on the change (rather than the level) of local
population and income. The construction sector and building-materials industries fall
into this category. The vigorous growth of building activity explains another large part of
the region’s post-war recovery. But this mechanism can not alone account for why the
higher level of economic activity was sustainable. As the discussion of the investment
accelerator in any standard macro text points out, the process has self-generating cycles.
Once growth begins to slow, sectors characterized by an accelerator relationship will
begin to contract, further slowing the economy.

To explain the appearance of a

permanently high level of economic activity in the region requires something more.
The third type of “home market effect”--the “threshold” effect recently
highlighted in the New Economic Geography literature--is one possibility. The idea here
is that production technologies for some goods involve fixed costs or other forms of
increasing-returns-to-scale that make local production unprofitable if the local market is
too small. As the market grows, it becomes economical to establish a larger number of
plants producing a wider range of goods in the region. In this case, local production will

14-20.
22

increase more than one-for-one with an increase in the size of the local market. Much of
the increase in western manufacturing outside of the “war industries” appears to fit into
this category.

Multiple Equilibria?
The third type effect of “home market effect” is especially intriguing in light the
prediction in the New Economic Geography literature that a region might possess more
than one equilibrium level of economic activity consistent with the same “fundamentals.”
Paul Krugman’s work has emphasized that three factors-- increasing returns to scale
(with the accompanying conditions of imperfect competition), labor mobility, and
transportation costs -- are key for such “home market effects” to matter significantly.
The case of manufacturing on the Pacific Coast in the mid-twentieth century matches the
theoretical requirements well.44
In addition, accounts of the West's growth written as the region developed--the
key works here are by Gordon and Niklason--stress the role of “home market effects” in
the growth process. Gordon called the inadequate size of the western market “the most
important factor that has hampered the growth of manufacturing” in the region. Because
of the small market, western firms could not produce “on a sufficiently large scale” to
offset the competitive advantages of eastern producing centers. Niklason's account of the
long-run growth process is particular apt:
The volume of output necessary to take full advantage of the saving incident to
large scale production depends upon the product, and the differences between various
products in this respect are great. This factor alone precludes the immediate development
of certain industries common to older, more populous regions...However, as population
increases and creates larger markets, opportunity is given to establish new industries until
eventually industrial maturity is attained....

giants such as Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations (London: Methuen, 1904) esp. Ch. 1-3 on the division of

23

These accounts also recognized the reverse flow from local production to local market
size, which made the process self-reinforcing. Indeed, a reading of the region's business
press yields the impression that the process was self-generating. In particular, many
writers in the 1940s argued the temporary boom during World War II set “the West on its
Way.”45
Did the World War II shock shift the Pacific Coast economy from a “low-level”
equilibrium to a “high-level” equilibrium? Were the “home market effects” that strong?
To address these questions, this section explores in greater detail the long-run
relationship between income and the value of manufacturing production. As part of
larger project on the economic development of the region, I have constructed a new panel
data set on manufacturing activity in the United States and California for the period since
1849. Comprehensive data on four-digit industries were drawn from the Census of
Manufacturing and assembled into consistent time series. (A list of the variables used in
the analysis is provided in Table 9. Their summary statistics are reported in Table 10.)
Unfortunately the data refer only to California and not the Pacific Coast as a whole.
Given the state’s great importance in the region and its dominant role in the expansion
during World War II, examining the California experience in detail promises to shed
considerable light on the development process of the region more generally.
To assess the role of “home market effects,” I predict the level of real
manufacturing value added in California using the level (or national share) of personal

A 1939 study by the Pacific Northwest Regional Planning Commission offers a similar analysis
regarding economies of Oregon and Washington: “The first and probably the greatest deterrent to
industrial expansion in the Pacific Northwest is the lack of a large consuming population. Mass production
requires mass purchasing. A population well under 4 million does not have this mass purchasing
power…branches of national concerns will not be established until the local market is large enough to
make this expansion profitable.” Northwest Regional Council, Men and Resources: A Study of Economic

income earned in the state as a measure of the size of the home market.46 This analysis
adopts the following conceptual approach: California real manufacturing value added is
modeled as proportional to national real manufacturing value added,
CalRVAit =αitUSRVAit.
where the proportion, αit, depends on relative demand, δ(Dit), and supply, σ(Sit). D
represents the set of demand shifters, S represents supply shifters. That is,
CalRVAit =δ(Dit)σ(Sit)USRVAit.
Relative supply is modeled as a function of establishment scale, human capital
requirements, relative wages over time, freight rates over time, and the industry’s twodigit category. Relative demand is modeled as a function of the California income
relative to national income (call θt=CalYt/USYt) and, in some formulations, whether the
industry exports.
A sample formulation would have θt raised to a power η as in:
CalRVAit =δ(θt) σ(Zit) USRVAit=θtη σ(Zit) USRVAit

(or in logs)

log(CalRVAit)= η log (θt )+log σ(Zit) + log(USRVAit)
In the models run, the coefficient on log(USRVAit) is not constrained to equal unity,
reflecting the possibility that USRVA enters in the supply shifters as well.
Following in the spirit of the Davis/Weinstein interpretation of Krugman’s work,
the test of the “home market effect” hypothesis has two forms:

46 Data series based on this general concept are available annually from the Department of Commerce
from 1929 on and from Easterlin for 1880, 1900, and 1920. Richard Easterlin, “Regional Growth in
Income,” in Simon Kuznets, et al., Population Redistribution and Economic Growth: United States, 18701950, 3 Vols. (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1957), III: 188, and for 1929-1960: U.S.
Department of Commerce, State Personal Income, 1929-1982 (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1984). Using a
methodology similar to Easterlin’s, I have developed independent state estimates for 1890 and 1910. The
intervening years were filled in by interpolation.
25

η>0

“home markets” matter at least weakly, (for example, transport costs>0).

η>1

“home markets effects” lead to a greater than one-for-one increase in
production in line with the New Economic Geography models.47
Table 11 presents the results of the Tobit regressions run on the pooled cross-

section/time series over the 1879-1963 period. Equation 1 predicts the (log of) real value
added of each industry in California based on the (log of) industry’s national real value
added, establishment scale, and wages per wage earner, and time-series variables
reflecting the general relative wage in California, an index of real regional freight rate,
and California personal income and national personal income.48 A set of consistent and
largely sensible results emerges from the analysis. Industries with large establishment
sizes nationally (as captured by lusrvest) had lower levels of output in the state,
confirming the impression that the region’s limited market constrained industrial activity
in sectors characterized by increasing-returns-to-scale.

Industries with hihg human

capital intensity (reflected in lusrwgwe) were more common in the state.
Among the time series variables, the relative wage variable has a significant
negative effect whereas the freight rates variable proved insignificant. The coefficient on
California income has a large positive effect, but that on national income has a large(r)
negative effect, which is troubling. Is this due to strong backwash effects? It seems more
likely to be the result of the substantial colinearity that exists between state and national
incomes. In line with the conceptual approach outlined above, the model may be run
using income shares. The standard likelihood ratio test approves of this formulation (but
it is interesting that the use of manufacturing output shares, that is, constraining the
coefficient of lusrva to be unity, is rejected.)
47 Donald R. Davis, “The Home Market, Trade, and Industrial Structure,” American Economic Review,
88:5, (Dec. 1998): 1264-76; and Donald R. Davis and David E. Weinstein, “Economic Geography and
Regional Production Structure: An Empirical Investigation,” European Economic Review, 43:2, (Feb.
1999): 379-407.
48 One potential difficulty that must give pause is the endogeneity of industrial production and the size of
the home market/ regional income. Indeed, the feedback from production to the market size is at the heart
of the cumulative causation story. Here is where the micro-data help (in addition, to providing standard
errors on the magnitude of the effects and a far number of degrees of freedom to test alternative
explanations.) The typical 4-digit industry was very small compared with the total size of the California
economy. For example, in 1939, the value added of the median California industry was $577,099, a little
over one-tenth of one percent of the total personal income of $5.3 billion.
26

Equation 2 reports the results of the income share regression. The coefficient of
California’s income share (as reflected by lcalusy) becomes about 1.44, which implies
that a ten-percent increase in the size of the region’s market increases its industrial output
by about 14 percent.

This seems large, but it is not wholly implausible given that the

elasticity of national manufacturing output with respect to income was about 1.27 in the
sample. What remains implausible is that the effect is constant over all market sizes.
Equation 3 addresses this problem by adding (orthogonalized) higher order terms in the
market size variable. Likelihood ratio tests approve of including terms up to the third
order. These results suggest an S-shaped and somewhat more damped “home market
effect.” The exact impact of a given change in the market size depends on what the
income share is.
A key problem in the interpretation in these regressions is the issue of omitted
variable biases. To control for the possibility that short-run supply shocks (strikes,
earthquakes) might be attributed to the California market share, I have included
individual year dummies in the model successively.

In no case were the effects

statistically significant or the basic results altered. Inclusion of a time trend also proved
inconsequential. A further possible problem is that the results may reflect business cycle
effects. To control for this effect, I included a measure of the US output gap, specifically
the deviation of real GDP from its long-run average. The business cycle coefficient
proved statistically insignificant and again the basic pattern of results was not changed.
There remains the possibility that the measured “home market effects” are picking
up omitted long-run supply shifts. Indeed, the New Economic Geography literature has
its own supply-side candidate—labor-market-pooling effects which can also lead to a
positive feedback relationship. One way to begin to address this issue is to examine a
model in which the export and non-export industries are treated separately. The “home
market” and “plant scale” effects are presumably less important for the export industries.
If the “home market” effect remains strong, it lends support to the argument that the
model is really capturing supply-side instead of demand-side forces.

27

Equation 4 runs the regression with separate coefficients for the leading export
activities, defined to comprise canning, petroleum refining, shipbuilding, and aircraft.49
The regression includes a new set of variables created by multiplying the existing
variables times an one/zero dummy reflecting whether or not the industry falls in the
export category. Essentially, these industries are allowed separate slope terms. While the
estimates are not highly precise, the separate slope terms wipe out most of the
establishment size and “home market” effects for the export industries. An increase in
the region’s market size by one percent (using 1939 as a base) reduces output in the
export industries by 0.6 percent. The absence of a “home market effect” for exports
paradoxically supports the “home market” hypothesis overall-- it’s not working where it
shouldn’t.50
What do these results imply about the possibility of multiple equilibria and the
impact of World War II spending? To explore these issues, consider a toy model of the
California economy. Let it be made up of three parts: a resource-base or export sector
that produces a given output, B, independent of the size of the home market; a service
sector where production grows proportionately with the home market, S=sY, and the
manufacturing sector characterized by the non-linear production-income relationship
estimated above, M(Y). Ignoring the distinction between income and output, aggregate
income will equal:
(1) Y=B+sY+ M(Y)=(B+M(Y))/(1-s).
Obviously, there may be multiple equilibria in Y supported by the same base, B, if the
non-linear equation (*) has more than one root. This will depend on the strength of the
non-linear production-income relationship embodied in M(Y) relative to the size of B.
Even if there are multiple equilibria, they may not be very different if the roots are close.
49 Inter-regional trade data are scanty but the available information indicates that canning and petroleum
accounted for the vast majority of California manufacturing exports. Including aircraft and shipbuilding,
these industries account for about 19.5 of California manufacturing value added in 1939.
50 The cubic series is quite well behaved within the sample, but it would be problematic to extrapolate it
far out of sample because no bounds have been imposed. The underlying series on the market/income
share is quite flat until the 1900s and then “takes off’; the stabilization of the income share begins in the
late 1950s and early 1960s, at the end of the period under consideration.
28

Let us use this model to analyze the state of the California economy on the eve of
World War Two. To be concrete, assume the primary sector (farming, agricultural
services, and mining) is the base. Over the 1938-40 period, this sector made up 10.5
percent of earnings in California whereas manufacturing accounted for 16.1 percent of
the state’s earnings. We will treat the remaining 73.4 percent of earnings as the service
sector.51
From the regression analysis, we know that holding all other variables (including
national income) constant, the M(Y) relationship in 1939 has roughly the following form
in the cubic specification:
Percentage Increase in California:

A data point of special interest what would happen if income increased by 21
percent--the percentage change in California’s income share over the 1939-47 period.
The regression equations indicate that a 21 percent increase in the California home
market would have resulted in a 27.3 percent increase in manufacturing value added
under the cubic specification. In the model sketched above, would such increases in
income have created a sufficiently large market (in the absence in a change in the base)
to support itself? Simple calculations suggest not; the effects are powerful, but not quite
strong enough. An increase in manufacturing value added of 27.3 percent combined with
no change in the base would have increased California income by only about 16.6 percent
(=(0.105+1.273*0.161)/0.266)-1).
But the results suggest that an increase in 1939 income by 11 percent would have
been self-sustaining. An 11 percent increase would have increased manufacturing output
by 18.5 percent, which in turn would have been sufficient to support the initial increase in
income. This implies that roughly one-half of the increase in the region’s income share
51 If the definition of the base is enlarged to include federal government earnings (the extractive sector
plus), the share of total income becomes 15.7 percent in 1939. The service share becomes 68.2 percent.

29

over the war might be due to a transition between “low-level” and “high-level” equilibria.
Even if the “home market effects” have been overestimated here, the slope of the outputincome relationship shown in equation (1) appears quite steep in the relevant range. This
implies a small change in the base, for example due to the shift in military spending from
its low pre-war values to its somewhat higher post-war values, could have had a large
effect on the level of aggregate activity. Obviously this is just a toy model, but these
results offer surprisingly strong support for the rather speculative predictions of the new
Economic Geography literature and call for further research.

Concluding remarks
This paper argues that the experience of the Pacific Coast economy after World
War II is consistent with the existence of strong “home market effects.” The econometric
analysis of the long-run relationship between local income and manufacturing production
suggests that these effects were not constant across all market sizes. Rather, they first
increased and then diminished in strength.

This has two interesting historical

implications.
First, the “home market effects” appear strongest not in the immediate post-war
period, but in the inter-war years. During the 1920s, the Pacific Coast, and especially
California, enjoyed a period of vigorous economic growth, which was cut short by the
Great Depression. Many aspects of the region’s post-war experience—its population
growth, the establishment of branch plants by national manufacturing firms, the building
boom, and the expansion of the service sector—were also present in the 1920s. It
remains an open question whether World War II shocked the Pacific Coast to a level of
economic activity that was otherwise unattainable or merely sped the transition to the
inevitable long-run equilibrium. I would argue that the continuity vs. discontinuity
debate over the impact of World War II in the West should shift to consider this broader
issue, which requires giving greater attention to the region’s secular development and less
to the “four short years” of the war.
Making this change would tend to reduce further the possibility of multiple equilibria.
30

Second, the “home market effects” became far weaker as the region matured. If
regional leaders used the late-1940s experience as a guide and downplayed the risk of
becoming dependence on military spending in the Cold War period, they were drawing a
mistaken historical lesson.

When the cutbacks came in the early-1990s, the region’s

economy appears to have suffered much more than after the larger declines of military
spending in the 1945-48 period. There was no great “unfilled” home market waiting in
the wings to absorb the displaced aerospace workers and to propel continued growth.
Unfortunately, you are only truly young once.
