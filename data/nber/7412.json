    "abstract": "\n\nWhile much is known about the impacts prices and tobacco control policies have on smoking participation and frequency of cigarette use, little is known about their impacts on smoking cessation. This paper addresses the dynamics of smoking cessation using longitudinal data on young adults from the Monitoring the Future Surveys.  Site-specific prices and several measures of clean indoor air restrictions are added to the survey data.  Both parametric and semi-parametric duration models are used to model multiple cessation attempts of young adults.  The estimates indicate that increases in the price of cigarettes increase the probability of initial smoking cessation as well as subsequent cessation for those individuals who are unable to remain smoke- free after at least one prior cessation attempt.  The average price elasticity of cessation is 0.343.  In addition, stronger restrictions on smoking in private worksites and public places other than restaurants increase the probability of young adult smoking cessation.\n\n",
