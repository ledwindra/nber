College Admissions as Non-Price Competition: The Case of South Korea
Christopher Avery, Soohyung Lee, and Alvin E. Roth
NBER Working Paper No. 20774
December 2014
JEL No. C78,I23
ABSTRACT
This paper examines non-price competition among colleges to attract highly qualified students, exploiting
the South Korean setting where the national government sets rules governing applications. We identify
some basic facts about the behavior of colleges before and after a 1994 policy change that changed
the timing of the national college entrance exam and introduced early admissions, and propose a gametheoretic model that matches those facts. When applications reveal information about students that
is of common interest to all colleges, lower-ranked colleges can gain in competition with higher-ranked
colleges by limiting the number of possible applications.

I. Introduction
College admissions is a matching market, in which applicants cannot simply choose what
college to attend, even if they can afford it, but in which they must also be admitted.
That is, prices are not used to equate supply and demand: selective colleges are priced to
attract many more students than they can admit, and admissions policies thus serve to
clear the market. Compared to the immense interest in college admissions in the press,
relatively little academic research on this topic has been conducted in the field of
economics. One reason may be that while college admissions processes are complex,
only partial information is available for analysis.
This paper utilizes a setting with a well-defined set of strategies for colleges and
where relevant information is available, namely South Korea, where the central
government determines the total number of seats a college can fill in an incoming cohort
and the methods by which a college can evaluate its applicants. These centralized rules
governing the admissions process allow us to model and analyze the strategic decisions
of South Korean colleges more precisely than would be possible in the decentralized
environment in which American colleges operate.
We focus on recent changes in the rules and timing for college admissions in
South Korea, and in particular, on a set of reforms that introduced early applications in
1994. 1 Between 1982 and 1993, the national exam required for college admission in
South Korea was only offered on two dates each year, and students were allowed to apply
for only one college per exam date.2 Thus, there was a structural limitation of at most
two applications per student. In addition, many of the most selective colleges, including
all of the top nine by a common reputational ranking (see Table 1), chose to fill their
classes on the first exam date. That is, students were able to apply to at most one very
selective college, since those colleges all held their examinations on the same day and
since a student could only apply to a college where he or she took the exam.
Limitations on the ability of students and colleges to explore possible matches
typically lead to inefficiencies characteristic of “congested” markets, when participants

year (March 1994).

are unable to “consider enough alternative possible transactions to arrive at satisfactory
ones” (Roth, 2008). Congestion frequently leads to unstable matches and subsequent
pressure to change the rules of the matching system (see for example Roth and Xing,
1997). In South Korea, it became common for students who were not admitted to their
first-choice colleges to wait another year and participate in the next admissions cycle
rather than to enroll immediately at a second (or worse) choice college.
Partly to address this obvious inefficiency, the South Korean government changed
the admission rules in 1994 to allow multiple applications, including a first phase
officially designated as an early application period.

This reform also introduced a

centralized date for the national examination during the early application period, thereby
allowing colleges to create and offer idiosyncratic and specialized examinations during
the regular application period. That is, after the reform the national exam was
administered to all students before the start of [early] applications, thereby allowing
colleges to develop additional individualized exams to further differentiate applicants
during the regular admissions process.
In this paper, we develop a model to study the incentives for colleges under these
two regimes and compare the predictions of the model to stylized facts about the behavior
of South Korean colleges given each set of rules. We then assess the success of the
reform using aggregated data on the number of re-applicants before and after these
changes to admissions rules.
Our analysis is related to several papers in the economics literatures on matching
and college admissions. Chen and Kao (2014a, 2014b) develop related models of
graduate school admissions in Taiwan to make the point that a second-ranked college can
gain from a “single application rule” if that would enable it to draw applicants away from
a top-ranked college. This result is quite similar in nature to Proposition 2 in this paper,
though our model is more general than that of Chen and Kao. Che and Koh (2014) study
the relationship between competition and coordination in admission policies of
competing colleges who are especially concerned about over-enrollment or underenrollment, finding that colleges have incentives to develop negatively correlated
admissions practices. Though they do not emphasize this point, the Che and Koh model
suggests that colleges might opt for a single application rule in order to reduce

3

uncertainty about total enrollment. 3 The competitive advantage gained by the less
preferred college in a single application system is reminiscent of strategic gains to lower
ranked colleges from early application programs in the United States (Avery and Levin
(2010), Avery, Fairbanks, and Zeckhauser (2003)).

Hafalir et al. (2014) compare

centralized admissions, by exam, in which students effectively can apply to all colleges,
with an alternative regime in which each student is restricted to apply to only one college.
They show that when students must decide how much costly effort to commit to the
admissions process, higher ability students prefer centralized admissions in this model.
Our model is also quite related in structure to the model of Chade, Lewis, and
Smith (2014) (we refer to this paper below as CLS), who study the application choices of
students considering two colleges, where one college is universally agreed to be
preferable to the other. The primary difference between our paper and CLS is in focus.
CLS is oriented towards “application portfolios”, especially the value of applying to both
colleges rather than just one of them. By contrast, we are interested in the current paper
about the strategic choices of the colleges to expand or contract application options for
students. That is, we consider the situation facing colleges whose strategies interact to
determine both the timing of applications and the number of applications that a student
can submit.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides additional background on the
nature and history of South Korean college admissions.

Section III describes the

theoretical model. Section IV reports the results of equilibrium analysis and suggests a
series of empirical hypotheses to test. Section V concludes.

This was precisely the motivation for an earlier reform in 1982 in South Korea that limited students to no
more than two applications under the rules described above. Prior to 1982, South Korean students could
apply to an unlimited number of colleges, but it was felt that colleges faced burdensome administrative
costs for keeping track of their waiting lists under those rules. (see Hwang, 1994)

II. Background on South Korean College Admissions
Graduating from a prestigious college is an effective and popular way for a South Korean
to improve his/her status (Sorensen 1994, and Lee 2007).4 Competition among students
is intense to gain admission to a prestigious college, and many high school graduates are
willing to spend an extra year in prep school in order to get an extra chance to apply to a
highly ranked college. Perhaps because of this intense social interest in college choice,
the South Korean government has been deeply involved in designing college admissions
systems and regulating the admissions policies of both public and private colleges.
College rankings are fairly well-agreed upon among South Koreans and stable
across time, which can be shown from the quality of applicants to each college and from
evaluation by third party agencies similar to the US News and World Report annual
rankings. Seoul National University (herein, Seoul National) is considered the best,
followed by the second group of colleges, which includes Yonsei, Korea, KAIST, and
Postech. The third group of colleges, considered to rank right below these four colleges,
includes Sogang, Hanyang, Seongkyunkwan, Ewha, Pusan, Kyungbook, Hankook
Foreign Language, Joongang, and Kyunghee universities.5 See Online Appendix 1.1 for
details.
From 1982 to 1993, the South Korean government conducted national exams
twice a year and required all colleges to make admissions decisions according to a
composite index based on the nationwide exam score and high school performance. 6
After some year-to-year modifications from 1982 to 1987, the Korean government settled
on a stable set of rules that were in place from 1988 to 1993, as shown in Panel A of
Figure 1.
In this system, the South Korean government announced the two exam dates
(typically one in January, the other in February) and then colleges announced how they
4

Lee (2007) reports that in 2003, 48 percent of the CEOs of the Hankyung’s top 81 South Korean firms
had been undergraduates at Seoul National University (which accounts for only 0.4 percent of South
Korean college graduates) and that an additional 26 percent of CEOs of these firms were undergraduates at
Yonsei or Korea University. By contrast, he finds that in 2004, 17 percent of CEOs of S&P 500 firms were
graduates of the top ten ranked colleges in the United States.
5
These rankings refer only to the main campuses of these colleges. Several of these top 13 ranked colleges
have additional affiliated campuses that typically operate independently and have much lower prestige.
6
In theory, colleges were allowed to conduct interviews and to include the results as up to 10 percent of the
composite index. In practice, however, such interviews had little effect on admission decisions (Hwang,
1994).

would allocate their seats between the two exam dates at the beginning of the academic
year. Each student was restricted to a maximum of two applications, one per national
examination date. Each application specified a single program of study at a particular
college and the candidate was required to take the exam at that particular college as part
of the application. In practice, Date 1 (early January) had the flavor of “early decision”
in the United States system, because students were required to enroll if admitted in that
round, while Date 2 (February) had the flavor of a last-chance “scramble.” Since most
high-ranked colleges allocated all of their seats to Date 1, in essence, students could only
apply to a single program at a high-ranked college.7
In 1994 the South Korean government introduced a series of reforms for
applications. These reforms had three major goals: (1) changing the format of the
national exam to emphasize complex reasoning skills rather than memorization; (2)
promoting the autonomy of individual colleges in admissions decisions by allowing
7

Similarly, in the United Kingdom, applicants are restricted to a single application to either Cambridge or
Oxford University. Further, this application must specify a particular college (one of the more than 60
colleges at the two universities) and a particular program of study at that college.

institution-specific examinations in part of the admissions process; (3) providing more
application options for students to reduce the number of students enrolling in prep school
and applying again the following year.8
These new rules changed the timing and location of the national exam, introduced
a system of early admissions, expanded the number of possible regular admission dates
from two to four, and allowed each college to administer a specialized exam as part of a
regular application. Under the rules of the revised system, students first took the
nationwide exam at a neighborhood public school in mid-November and learned their
scores prior to submitting an application to any college. As in the previous system, each
application was to a single program of study at a particular college. Colleges specified
how many seats in the entering class to allocate to early admission (it was possible to
choose not to participate in early admissions by allocating zero seats to it) and then
allocated all remaining seats across the four regular application dates.
Panel B of Figure 1 shows the timeline that was in place after the introduction of
early applications in 1994. Once a student received his/her test score on the nationwide
exam, he/she decided whether to submit an early application (in mid-December) to a
college that offered early admission. Early admission was binding in that a student could
apply early to only one school, and was required to enroll if admitted. A student
participating in regular admissions could apply to up to four schools (one school per
regular admission date) and could choose from among those that admitted him/her. 9 One
important difference between early and regular admission was that students took a
specialized exam at each college to which they applied as regular applicants, whereas
early admission was based only on high school grades and scores on the national exam.

8

The original documents are in Korean and are available at the national archive of official government
documents at http://contents.archives.go.kr. We also consulted a 1998 technical report from the South
Korean Ministry of Education, “50 Years of Korean Education Policies”. Weidman and Park (2000) for an
overview of the South Korean college admission system written in English.
9
There were policy debates over providing students even more opportunities for college applications
instead of giving them up to 5 chances (early admission and four applications in regular admission).
However, there was major resistance from colleges, based on several concerns, including the possibility of
“losing face,” “congestion,” and lack of applications to low-ranked colleges.
(http://magazine.kcue.or.kr/last/popup.html?vol=99&no=476
http://www.snujn.com/site/art_view.html?id=878) There may also have been some institutional memory of
the problems with the system prior to 1982, when students were allowed to apply to an unlimited number of
colleges.
7

In part for this reason, a student who applied but was not admitted to a particular program
as an early applicant could apply again to that same program in regular admissions.
In 2002, the government changed the application system in an attempt to promote
diversity in enrollment. Early applications were limited to students who met particular
eligibility criteria, such as qualifying for the Math Olympiad or residing in an
underrepresented rural area. Although it was not stated explicitly, it seems plausible that
this reform was intended to limit the importance of early applications. However, since
the criteria for eligibility were set individually by each college, the program quickly
expanded to include a wide range of applicants, as we discuss below. The rules for
regular admissions have been largely unchanged from 1994 to the present, though today
there are three rather than four possible dates for regular applications.
This paper focuses on the admission policies of 13 elite colleges between 1993
and 2001. While we do not study the policies of these colleges in detail beyond 2001, we
view the evolution of their strategies between 2002 and the present as largely consistent
with the results for the system between 1993 and 2001, as we describe in the discussion
of Tables 2, 3, and 4 below.
We collected the information released by the Korean Council for University
Education (KCUE) and by Seoul National and all colleges in Groups 2 and 3, excluding
KAIST.10 We omit KAIST because it is exempt from the government’s college admission
policy in that in addition to high school seniors (12th graders), it can accept 11th graders
enrolled in science high schools without a nationwide test score.

10

For each admission cycle, we collected press releases by those colleges every year, reported in 5 major
South Korean newspapers. Such press releases include the information of the total seats, and the allocation
of seats across exam dates and early application. For each college and year, we crosscheck the accuracy of
the information by checking two to three different major newspapers.

8

II.A Stylized Facts
This information suggests the following stylized facts.
(F1) Prior to the policy change in 1994, almost all elite colleges chose the same date
(Date 1) for the national exam and admissions.
Table 1 shows the number of seats each college can fill up to and the fraction of seats
allocated between Dates 1 and 2 in 1993. For example, Seoul National, Korea, Yonsei,
and Postech selected their students entirely from Date 1, as did the majority of the group
3 colleges. Although several colleges selected students from both Dates 1 and 2, they still
filled the majority of their seats on Date 1.

(F2) After the policy change in 1994, schools just below the very top chose a different
(regular) admissions date than the date chosen by the top-ranked school, Seoul National.
Although the government specified four separate possible dates for regular admissions,
most of the top-ranked colleges chose a single date for regular admissions in each year
during this time period. For example, in 1994 and 1995, all 13 colleges conducted
regular admissions on just a single date, though not all chose the same date. Similarly, in
2000 and 2001, 10 of these 13 colleges conducted regular admissions on just a single date
9

and two of the others offered a clear majority (between 70 and 100 percent) of their
regular admissions seats on a single date.
Table 2 identifies the date for which each of these 13 colleges offered the majority
of its regular admissions seats from 1994 to 2001. (See Online Appendix 1.2 for the
exact percentages of seats offered by each college in each year.) In the first two years
after the policy change, 10 of these 13 colleges continued their pre-existing practice of
emphasizing “Date A”, the regular admissions date chosen by Seoul National. 11
However, in 1996, the third year after the reform, seven of these colleges switched from
“Date A” to “Date B”. From that point on, none of the Group 2 colleges and at most 3 of
the 9 Group 3 colleges offered “Date A” as its primary date for regular admissions.
Despite the small sample size, this reduction from 75% in 1995 to 25% in 2001 of Group
2 and Group 3 colleges offering “Date A” as the primary regular admissions date is
statistically significant at the 5% level in a simple two-sample Binomial comparison.

For simplicity in presentation, we define “Date A” as the regular admissions date chosen by Seoul
National University, “Date B” as the regular admissions date chosen by Postech, and “Date C” as a
combination of the remaining two regular admissions dates specified by the government.
10

Figure 2 plots the average percentages of regular admissions seats allocated to
Date A in each group and year, weighting each college equally. 12 From 1996 to 2001, a
negligible fraction of regular admission seats were allocated to Date A in Group 2. For
Group 3, the average fraction of regular admissions seats allocated to Date A decreased
from over 80 percent to less than 40 percent in 1996 and then settled around 30 percent.
Figure 2 Regular Admission: Fraction of Seats Allocated to Date A (Seoul National)

(F3) Early applications gained steadily in importance from 1994 to 2001. Seoul
National, the top-ranked college, was among the last colleges to adopt early admissions.
Table 3 presents the share of seats each college allocated to early admission in each year
from 1994 to 2001. Although 10 of the 12 competitors to Seoul National adopted early
admissions immediately after the reform in 1994, they initially offered proportionally few
seats to early applicants, and only one of them, Postech, enrolled 40 percent of its
entering class early that year. All twelve of these colleges increased their use of early
admissions over time, and by 2001, Hanyang was the only one that enrolled less than 40
percent of its entering class early. As a group, these 12 colleges almost tripled their use
of early admissions between 1994 and 2001, offering an average of 16.8% of their seats
12

The results are similar if we use a weighted average based on the number of seats offered by each
college.

Figure 3 graphs the fraction of seats allocated to early admission by group and
year. The percentage of seats offered to early applicants by both Group 2 and Group 3
colleges increased fairly steadily over time, and by 1999 colleges in both groups were
offering an average of more than 40 percent of their seats to early applicants.
Interestingly, Seoul National began offering early admissions only in 1999, after its
primary competitors were already emphasizing early admissions to a considerable degree.
This choice mirrors changes in early admission practice in the United States, where
Harvard and Princeton eliminated their early application programs in 2006, but then
reinstated them in 2011. Administrators from both these colleges explained a primary
reason for this change in 2011 was that not offering early applications was putting their
institutions at a competitive disadvantage. For example, Michael Smith, Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, commented: “We looked carefully at trends in
Harvard admissions these past years and saw that many highly talented students,
including some of the best-prepared low-income and underrepresented minority students,
were choosing programs with an early-action option, and therefore were missing out on
the opportunity to consider Harvard”.13

Figure 3 Percentage of Seats Offered Through Early Admission

Although we do not have direct evidence about the decision of Seoul National to offer
early admissions for the first time in 1999, the circumstantial evidence suggests that it did
so in response to competitive pressure. Interestingly, it appears that its competitors
responded by emphasizing early admission to an even greater degree. The three Group 2
competitors to Seoul National offered an average of 46 percent of seats to early
applicants in 1997, 1998, and 1999, but then increased this percentage to 53 and 56
percent in 2000 and 2001, the two years after Seoul National first offered early
admissions.
(F4) The rule change in 2002 had little effect on the prevailing trends in admission
practice. Early admissions has continued to grow in importance to the present, while
schools just below the very top continue to choose a different (regular) admissions date
than the date chosen by the top-ranked school, Seoul National.
Table 4 presents the share of seats each college allocated to early admission and to each
of the regular admission dates in 2014 and 2015. Whereas these colleges allocated an
average of 45 percent of seats to early applicants in 2000 and 2001, they now allocate an

13

average of 68 percent of seats to early applicants today. In addition, the second-tier
colleges, Korea and Yonsei continue to choose a different regular admission date than the
top ranked college, Seoul National.

(F5) The 1994 reform somewhat reduced, but by no means eliminated the phenomenon
of repeat applications.
Table 5 lists the number of high school seniors and repeat applicants to (all) four-year
colleges in South Korea from 1990 to 2001. An average of 318,543 students – more than
half of the high school seniors from the prior year14- were repeat applicants each year in
the four years prior to the reform. In 1994, the first year after the reform, there was an
immediate drop of about 25% in the number of repeat applicants, but some potential
repeat applicants may have been discouraged by the change in format of the national
exam that went along with the reform. After excluding 1994, there were an average of
260,288 repeat applicants per year from 1995 to 2001, or about an 18 percentage point
decline per year from the four years just prior to the reform. Despite the small sample

and after the 1994 reform is significant at the 1% level in a two sample t-test.

Two demographic changes complicate the analysis of pre- and post-reform data.
First, Table 5 indicates a conspicuous decline in the number of high school seniors from
1993 to 1994-1997, the first four years after the reform.

It would be predictable,

presumably with a one-year lag, to find fewer repeat applicants in this period when there
were fewer new applicants than the pre-reform period. The decline in the number of high
school seniors eventually reversed, however, and there were even more high school
seniors in each year from 1998 to 2000 (and almost as many in 2001) as in any year from
1990 to 1993. Further, there were even fewer repeat applicants in this period from 1998
to 2001 than in the first four years after the reform.15
Second, Table 5 indicates that the total admission seats available increased every
year during the sample period, resulting in an increase in more than 50% in available
places from 1990 to 2001. Presumably, this expansion of admission seats would yield a
15

Restricting the post-reform sample to 1998 to 2001, with or without incorporating a one year lag for
repeat applicants to appear in the data, we still find a significant decline in the absolute number of repeat
applicants per year by comparison to the pre-reform years of 1990 to 1993.
15

result where more students would be placed in desirable college seats each year – if so, it
would be predictable to find fewer repeat applicants in subsequent years as a result. One
straightforward approach to account for the expansion of admission seats is to find the
ratio of repeat applicants in one year to the number of applicants who applied the
previous year but did not enroll (the difference between total number of applicants and
total number of seats). 16 By this approach, we find only a very small (and clearly
insignificant) change as a result of the reform: 46.4 percent of unmatched students in
1990 to 1992 and 44.7 percent of unmatched students in 1998 to 2000 returned as repeat
applicants the following year. At the same time, this approach presumably overstates the
importance of the expansion of seats, for it is likely that the new seats were
disproportionately placed at low-ranked colleges and that many of them were not filled.
Taking these observations together, we find little evidence that the reduction in
the number of repeat applicants after the 1993 reform could be explained by changes in
the number of high school seniors each year, but it is possible that the expansion of the
number of places in colleges could explain at least some of this reduction.
III. The Model
Suppose that there are two colleges and a continuum of ex ante identical students. All
students have identical preferences with utility u1 = 1 for attending College 1 and utility
u2 for attending College 2, where 0 < u2 < 1.

Each college wishes to enroll the same

proportion K < ½ of all students. Applications are costless, so if possible, each student
applies to both colleges.
At the start of the application process, the only information differentiating one
student from another is high school grade point average, which we denote by xi for
student i. During the application process, each student takes the national college entrance
exam and we denote student i’s score on this exam by si. We assume further that colleges
agree on a subsequent ranking of students based on an index, yi = y(xi, si), which
summarizes the information contained in high school grades and the national exam score,
with all values xi, si, yi scaled to range from 0 to 1.
Student i provides utility vij to the college by enrolling at college j, where vij
16

This computation assumes that all available seats are filled in a given year by applicants from that year.
16

ranges from 0 to 1 . We assume that a student’s grades, xi, national exam score si, and
specialized exam score sij at college j (if available) sij combine to identify vij = z(yi, sij),
where z is continuous, differentiable and strictly increasing in each argument, while si1
and si2 are identically distributed and conditionally independent given xi and si.17 We
further assume that there is a joint distribution of values f(xi, si, vij) such that the
conditional distributions g(yi | xi) and h(vij | yi) satisfy the strict monotone likelihood ratio
property: for yi < yi’ and vij > vij’
h(vij | yi) / h(vij’ | yi) >

h(vij | yi’) / h(vij’ | yi’).

Similarly, for xi > xi’, yi > yi’,
g(yi | xi) / g(yi’ | xi)

>

g(yi | xi’) / g(yi’ | xi’).

To rule out boundary issues, we assume that all possible pairwise combinations of
GPA and national test score, national test score and specialized exam score take strictly
positive densities: f(xi, si, sij) >  for each (xi, si, sij ) and similarly g(yi | xi) >  for each
(xi, yi); h(vij | yi) >  for each (yi, vij), where  is a known positive constant.
We use this general framework to study the incentives for colleges and students
using equilibrium analysis for each of two different sets of rules. We label the initial set
of rules, which were in place until 1994, as “Regime 1”. In Regime 1, we assume that
student i knows xi at the start of the admissions process, prior to submitting any
applications, and that admissions decisions at each college are based on yi values.
College 1 moves first and announces which one of the two possible dates it will offer.
Then College 2 responds by announcing its choice of the two possible admission dates.
Once the colleges have announced their admission timetables, students decide which
college to apply to on the first date and the admissions process moves along accordingly
from there. Any student admitted on Date 1 must attend the college where he/she
applied; a student who was not admitted on Date 1 can apply again on Day 2. We prove

17

The assumption that si1 and si2 are conditionally independent given xi and si essentially means that the
specialized exam score at one college is not relevant to the student’s likely performance at the other
college. We make this extreme assumption to emphasize the differential implications of (1) common
information about a student’s underlying academic preparation and (2) idiosyncratic information about the
value of a student-college match for the strategies selected by colleges.
17

in Online Appendix 3 that Proposition 2, the key result for Regime 1, also holds in the
case where each college can admit some students on each date.18
We label the new system, which was put in place in 1994 as “Regime 2”. In
Regime 2, we assume that student i knows yi at the start of the admissions process, prior
to submitting any applications, that early admissions decisions at each college are based
on yi and that regular admissions decisions at college j are based on vij values (as
revealed by specialized exams at each college). College 1 moves first and announces
both the number of students it will admit early and the regular admissions date it will use
to fill the remainder of its entering class, then College 2 responds by announcing its
allocation of seats to early and regular admissions along with its regular admissions date.
Once these admission schedules are announced, students decide whether to apply early to
one college and the admissions process moves along accordingly from there. In this
regime, early application is binding, so that any student admitted early must attend the
college where he/she applied early, but regular admission is not binding. A regular admit
to one college can still apply to the other college if it still has admission dates/seats
available; a student who is admitted in regular admissions to both colleges can choose
between them (and will choose College 1, since we assume u1 > u2 for all students).
We focus on equilibrium in the timetables announced by the two colleges under
each regime, along with the resulting allocation of students to colleges in those equilibria.
We use subgame perfect equilibrium as our equilibrium concept throughout the paper for
competition between College 1 and College 2 since we assume that College 1 moves first
and that College 2 observes College 1’s choices and then moves second.

18

Under the rules for Regimes 1 and 2, colleges were allowed to allocate seats for admission on multiple
regular admission dates, but in practice, as shown in Table 2 and Online Appendix Table A.1, the 13
highest-ranked colleges almost always allocated seats to just one regular admissions date.
18

IV. Equilibrium Analysis
A. Information Structure and the Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property
We record several properties of the relationship between xi and yi – all related to the
Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property – that are fundamental to our equilibrium analysis.
These properties, especially Properties 1 and 2 are standard,19 but we include them with
proofs in Online Appendix 2 for the sake of being comprehensive. Since both (xi, yi) and
(yi, vij) satisfy the strict Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property, these four properties apply
to both pairs of variables.
Property 1: The distribution of application quality (y) given high school grades (x) First
Order Stochastically Dominates the distribution of application quality (y)
given test score x’ if x > x’.
Property 2: E(y | x) > E(y | x’) if x > x’.
Property 3: E(y | x, y < r) is increasing in x for any constant r.
Property 4: For r1 > r2, the ratio Px(y > r1) / Px(y > r2) is increasing in x.
B. Equilibrium Analysis without Early Applications
In Regime 1, the colleges agree on a common ranking of all students based on yi-values,
though these values are not revealed to students until after they receive admission
decisions. Denote y(M) to the denote a threshold value that is implicitly defined by the
equation F(y(M)) = M. If College 1 chooses Date 1 and College 2 chooses Date 2, then
all students apply to College 1 first, the top K (those with yi > y(K)) are admitted and
enroll at College 1, and the next K students (those with those with y(2K) < yi < y(K)) enroll
subsequently at College 2.20

19

In fact, MLRP Property 1 was documented in Proposition 1 of Milgrom’s (1981) seminal paper, while
MLRP Properties 2 and 3 are closely related to Proposition 4 in that same paper.
20
Here, the top K students are those with values above threshold y(K) which is implicitly defined by
Fy(y(K)) = 1-K and similarly, the top 2K students are those with values above threshold y(2K) which is
implicitly defined by Fy(y(2K)) = 1-2K.
19

If instead, both College 1 and College 2 choose to admit all students on Date 1,
then the admissions process amounts to a “Single Application Game”, where each student
can apply to at most one of the two colleges. Proposition 1 shows that the equilibrium of
the Single Application Game in Regime 1 takes a natural monotonic form described by
Chade, Lewis, and Smith as a “robust sorting equilibrium”, where both colleges use
threshold admission rules and the most promising students apply to College 1.21 A
similar result applies in Regime 2 when student i knows yi at the time of application and
an application reveals the value of vij to College j.
Proposition 1: Suppose that student i knows xi at the time of application and that yi will
be revealed by that student’s application. If students are limited to a single application,
there is a unique admissions equilibrium with thresholds x*, y*C1, y*C2, where students
with xi > x* apply to College 1, students with xi < x* apply to College 2, College 1
admits students with yi > y*C1 and College 2 admits students with yi > y*C2.
Proof: See Appendix.
To attract applicants, College 2 must adopt a lower admissions threshold than College 1
in equilibrium of the Single Application Game. Thus, since the colleges enroll a total of
2K students, College 1 adopts a threshold above and College 2 adopts a threshold below
y(2K) in any equilibrium of the Single Application Game. 22 Thus, the equilibrium
allocation of students to colleges in the Single Application Game is not efficient, as some
students with yi < y(2K) enroll at College 2 and some students with yi > y(2K) do not enroll
at either college (this second group of students all apply to College 1 and are rejected).23
Given the choice of admission dates in Regime 1 (where there is no possibility of
early application), College 2 faces a tradeoff. If it opts for the Single Application Game
21

In fact, our Proposition 1 mirrors Proposition 1 of Chade, Lewis, and Smith, though in a different
context, as their model assumes costly applications and endogenous choices of the number of applications
submitted by each student.
22
If both colleges adopt admission thresholds above y(2K), they combine to admit strictly fewer than 2K
students, and similarly if both colleges adopt admission thresholds below y(2K), they combine to admit
strictly fewer than 2K students. We assume that u2 is sufficiently large that College 2 is able to fill its class
in equilibrium of the Single Application Game.
23
Here, we assume that assortative matching of students to colleges is socially desirable.
20

by choosing the same admissions date as College 1, it will only attract applicants with
low grades (i.e. students with xi values below some cutoff x*). This yields one source of
gains and a separate source of losses to College 2. By comparison to its ordinary
allocation of students with y(2K) < yi < y(K) when all students apply to both colleges,
College 2 enrolls additional students with low grades and high test scores (xi < x* and yi
> y(K)), but loses some appealing students who would ordinarily enroll at College 2, but
do not apply to College 2 in equilibrium of the Single Application Game (xi > x*, y(K) >
yi > y(2K)). Proposition 2 shows that this tradeoff for College 2 between these gains and
losses turns on the value of u2. If u2 is sufficiently large, then College 2 gains by
choosing the same admissions date as College 1 in Regime 1, but otherwise, College 2
prefers to choose a different admissions date than College 1.24
Intuitively, when u2 is relatively small, College 2 attracts few applicants in the
Single Application Game and must relax its admissions threshold considerably to fill its
entering class. But at the other extreme, when u2 is close to u1, College 2 can compete
successfully for applicants in the Single Application Game in Regime 1 and does not
need to relax its admissions threshold very much from y(2K) when it offers the same
admissions date as College 1.
Proposition 2: In Regime 1, if each college must choose either Date 1 or Date 2 to admit
all students, then there is a threshold value u* such that College 2 will choose the same
admissions date as College 1 if u2 > u* and will choose a different admissions date than
College 1 if u2 < u*.
Proof: Assume that College 1 chooses Date 1. If College 2 chooses Date 2, then students
apply to both colleges and College 1 takes those with the highest yi values.

The

admission cutoffs for the colleges are implicitly defined by the equations F(y(K)) = 1-K
and F(y(2K)) = 1-2K, so that College 2 enrolls students with y-values between y(2K) and
y(K), while College 1 enrolls students with y-values between y(K) and 1.

24

This result matches the qualitative results of Chen and Kao (2013, 2014) but with continuous
distributions of both applicant signals (xi) and assessments of applicant ability (yi) by schools as opposed to
binary distributions .
21

If both colleges choose Date 1, then as shown in Proposition 1, there is a robust
sorting equilibrium where the threshold (in an interior equilibrium) value x for students to
apply to College 1 is implicitly defined by the equation
P(yi > yC1 | xi = x*) / P(yi > yC2 | xi = x*)

=

u2.

We observed in the proof of Proposition 1 that x* is strictly increasing in u2, so College 2
strictly gains applicants and thus strictly gains in utility in equilibrium as u2 increases.
As College 2 approaches College 1 in utility (i.e. u2  1), (1) the cutoffs for admission
must become approximately equal so that some students are willing to apply to each
college and (2) both admission thresholds must tend to y(2K) to ensure that a total of 2K
students are admitted overall. That is, yC1(x) and yC2(x)  y(2K) as u2  1, so the set of
students admitted to at least one of College 1 or College 2 is exactly the same as in the
case above where the colleges offer different application dates.25 But College 2 gets the
lesser half of the group of admitted students with different application dates, but enrolls
at least some of the top half of admitted students (given the assumption that f(xi, yi) is
strictly positive ) in the limiting equilibrium when both colleges offer the same
application date with u2  1.

Thus College 2 prefers to choose the same application

date as College 1 in the limit as u2  1. Further, since College 2 has strictly increasing
utility in u2, there must be some cutoff u2* such that College 2 prefers to choose the same
application date as College 1 iff u2 > u2*. END OF PROOF
One critical difference between Regime 1 and Regime 2 is that students take the national
exam and learn their yi values prior to application date 1. Under these conditions,
College 2 prefers to choose a different admissions date than College 1 in order to avoid
the “Single Application Game” in Regime 2.
Proposition 3: If there is no early application program in Regime 2, then College 2
prefers to choose a different regular application date than College 1 for all values of u2.

25

Apart from the limit as u2  u1, yC2 < yC1 and so it must be that yC2 < y(2K) < yC1, meaning that some
students with y < y(2K) enroll at College 2, but some students with y > y(2K) apply to College 1 and are not
admitted in a single application equilibrium.
22

Proof: If Colleges 1 and 2 both choose Date 1, the students with the highest si values
apply to College 1 and fewer than 1-K students apply to College 2. If College 1 chooses
Date 1 and College 2 chooses Date 2, then College 2 gets more applications than before
(from the 1-K students with vi1 values below College 1's cutoff) and also a better
selection of applicants (those with lowest values of vi1 rather than si). So College 2
unambiguously gains by choosing a different date than College 1. END OF PROOF
Without early applications, Regimes 1 and 2 are superficially similar; in each case,
students possess some information about themselves beforehand, and reveal additional
information to the colleges with their applications. The distinction is that in Regime 1,
each application reveals information of common interest to the colleges (yi), whereas in
Regime 2, it reveals information of idiosyncratic interest (vi1 and vi2) to the colleges.
College 2 is operating at a competitive disadvantage, so it will always suffer from
negative selection in the application process. In Regime 2, it has the option of negative
selection based on yi if it chooses Date 1 and competes directly with College 1 for
applicants, or negative selection based on vi1 if it chooses Date 2 and only attracts
applicants who were not previously admitted to College 1. From the perspective of
College 2, however, vi1 is simply a noisy version of yi, since it depends on the specialized
exam score at College 1, which is assumed not to be relevant to the student’s
performance at College 2. So College 2 prefers negative selection of applicants based on
vi1 rather than yi. Further, College 2 gets a larger proportion of applicants by choosing a
different admissions date than by choosing the same admissions date as College 1. So
College 2 gets a larger volume of applicants and a preferable sorting of applicants in
Regime 2 by choosing Date 2 rather than competing directly with College 1 on Date 1.
(By contrast, as described above, College 2 faces a tradeoff between larger volume of
applicants on Date 2 but preferable sorting of applicants on Date 1 in Regime 1.) So both
incentives induce College 2 to choose a different regular admissions date than College 1
in Regime 2.
One interesting example to consider is the extreme case where almost all of a
student’s value to a college is revealed by grades and the national exam score so that vij ≈
yi. Then admission decisions in Regimes 1 and 2 are based on essentially the same

23

information about applicants. However, given the difference in timing of the national
exam in the two regimes, applicants would still have much more information at the time
of application in Regime 2 than in Regime 1, and that change of information causes
College 2 to wish to choose a different regular admissions date than College 1. In the
limiting case in this example where vij → yi, College 2 would not receive any
applications from students with yi > y(K) if it chooses the same date for regular
admissions as College 1 in Regime 2, and so it could still do better by choosing a
different admissions date than that of College 1.
C. Equilibrium Analysis with Early Applications
We now extend the model to allow for early applications. The early application system
in Korea is unusual because most of the components of admission decisions are
numerical and are known to students at the time of application.
To simplify analysis, we assume that u2 is sufficiently large that all students
would accept an early offer of admission to College 2 (even if yi = 1, the maximum value
for a student’s observed credentials at the deadline for early application) rather than
attempting to gain admission to College 1 as a regular applicant. This assumption may
not be too far from the situation that caused College 1, Seoul National to belatedly adopt
early admissions and gradually expand the number of students it admitted early in
response to the growing emphasis on early applications by its competitors, who were able
to enroll through early admissions students who Seoul wished to attract.
We consider the following early application game. First, College 1 chooses a
regular admissions date, then College 2 decides whether to offer the same regular
admissions date or a different one. Once these regular admissions dates are set, the
colleges announce their thresholds for early and regular admission and then students
make their application decisions.26 Thus, we can summarize any equilibrium by the fourtuple (e1, r1, e2, r2) where ej represents the threshold value of yi for early admission to
college j and rj represents the threshold value of vij for regular admission to college j.

26

We assume that both colleges offer early application programs but also allow for the possibility that each
may decide not to admit any early applicants. /
24

We identify properties of the early application equilibria under both Regime 2S,
where College 2 chooses the same regular application date as College 1 so that only a
“Single” regular application per student is possible, and under Regime 2M, where
College 2 chooses a different regular application date than College 1 so that “Multiple”
regular applications per student are possible. We then compare the results for College 2
in equilibrium under these separate regimes in order to determine whether it would
choose the same regular application date or a different regular application date from that
of College 1.
We prove equilibrium existence for the separate subgames corresponding to
Regimes 2M and 2S in Online Appendix 4. Though we only prove the existence of a
unique equilibrium in Regime 2S (when the colleges have set the same date for regular
admission), we are still able to provide sharp comparative static comparisons between
that equilibrium and all equilibria in Regime 2M (when the colleges have set different
dates for regular admission).
In Proposition 4, we use a revealed preference argument to show that College 2
can guarantee at least the same utility in Regime 2M as it achieves in the unique
equilibrium in Regime 2S by simply choosing to admit the same number of early
applicants in Regime 2M as it does in the unique equilibrium of Regime 2S. With this
strategy, College 2 gets a better distribution of early admits in Regime 2M (because e1M
> e1S, i.e. College 1 is more selective in its early admits) and does at least as well in
regular admissions in Regime 2M as in Regime 2S. By revealed preference, College 2
prefers its outcome in Regime 2M than in Regime 2S and will choose a different regular
admissions date than College 1 in Regime 2.
Proposition 4: College 2 gets a higher payoff in any early application equilibrium in
Regime 2M than in the unique early application equilibrium in Regime 2S, so will
choose a different regular admissions date than College 1.
Proof: See Appendix.

25

Stylized Fact 3 observes that Seoul National (which corresponds to College 1 in the
model) did not adopt early admissions until after its rival colleges expanded early
admissions considerably. We do not attempt to provide a description of any dynamic
process resulting in equilibrium in our model, so cannot address this fact directly, but can
demonstrate that this stylized fact is consistent with College 1’s best response function in
the model.

In Regime 2M, when the colleges choose different dates for regular

admissions, College 1 knows that it can enroll any applicant it wishes to admit in early
admissions and also that it can enroll any remaining applicant (i.e. anyone not admitted
early to College 2) it wishes to admit in regular admissions. So its best response to
College 2’s admissions standards depends only on College 2’s early threshold.

In

particular, as shown in Proposition 5, College 1’s best response function calls for more
aggressive use of early applications (through lower threshold for early admission) when
other colleges are more aggressive in their use of early applications.
Proposition 5: College 1’s best response function for the early application threshold
e1M(e2M) is increasing in e2M and is strictly increasing whenever e1M (e2M) < 1.
Proof: Suppose that (e1, r1) is the best response for College 1 to some early application
threshold e2 for College 2, so that E(vi1 | y1 = e1) = r1. Then if College 2 chooses e2’ < e2,
College 1 faces a smaller pool of regular applicants than before and would not fill its
class with admission cutoffs (e1, r1). So College 1 would have to relax its admissions
cutoffs to maintain its enrollment and would have to reduce both e1 and r1 in order to
maintain its indifference between marginal early admits and marginal regular admits.
Thus since e1 must decrease when e2 is reduced, e1M(e2M) is strictly increasing whenever
e1M(e2M) < 1 (so that e1M can be increased). END OF PROOF
D. Allocational Comparisons across Regimes
The 1994 admissions reforms provide additional information to students (who now know
their yi values at the time of application) and colleges (which can now observe vij values
for regular applicants) and also ensure that students can apply to both colleges in

26

equilibrium.

These features of the new admission system induce a more efficient

equilibrium allocation of students to colleges in Regime 2 than in Regime 1.
Proposition 6: College 1 achieves a higher payoff in equilibrium in Regime 2 than it
does in equilibrium of Regime 1. The average of the payoffs to the two colleges is
greater in equilibrium in Regime 2 than in equilibrium of Regime 1.
Proof: College 1 achieves maximum payoff in Regime 1 if it admits students on Date 1
and College 2 admits students only on Date 2. In this case, College 1 enrolls students
with the highest y-values, specifically those with yi > y(K). In Regime 2, College 1 can
replicate this outcome by setting a threshold of y(K) for early admission. It can improve
on this outcome by setting a threshold for early admission arbitrarily close to, but just
above y(K). Regardless of the early admission threshold set by College 2, College 1 can
anticipate that it will enroll a small number of regular applicants with unexpectedly high
values of vi1 given yi -- in particular with vi1 > E(vi1 | yi = y(K)).27 Thus, since College 1
has an admissions strategy available that does better than any equilibrium payoff in
Regime 1, it must do better in equilibrium in Regime 2 than in equilibrium in Regime 1.
To compare the average payoffs to the two colleges in Regime 1 and Regime 2,
first note that in Regime 1, students are admitted on the basis of yi values, with maximum
average value per student of E(vij | yi > y(2K)). Suppose that College 2 uses a regular
admission threshold based on yi rather than on vi2 in Regime 2. Since College 1 admits
some students in regular admissions in Regime 2 with yi < y(2K), College 2 could set this
regular admission threshold above y(2K) and still fill its class. Then the set of students
enrolling at the two colleges combined in Regime 2 would match the set of students
enrolling in Regime 1, except that College 1 enrolls some students in Regime 2 who are
preferred (according to their yi1 values) to the students they replace from Regime 1. This
implies that the average values of all students enrolling at College 1 and College 2 to
those colleges is higher in Regime 2 than in Regime 1. END OF PROOF

27

This follows from the assumption that all values of yi and vi1 have strictly positive densities.
27

The economic intuition underlying Proposition 6 is straightforward. The rule changes in
Regime 2 restore College 1’s dominance in the admission process in two ways. First, the
introduction of specialized examinations induce College 2 to choose a different date for
regular admission than College 1, thereby ensuring that all regular applicants can apply to
both colleges, and thus that College 1 has its pick of them. Second, since students know
yi prior to the early admissions stage and since early admission decisions are entirely
based on yi values, any applicants that College 1 wishes to attract to apply early will do
so.
The rule changes in Regime 2 have countervailing effects on the results for
College 2. On the one hand, the introduction of early admissions and revelation of
national exam scores to students prior to the application process both serve to reduce
College 2’s ability to compete with College 1 for applicants. On the other hand, the
introduction of specialized examinations enables the college to differentiate their
admissions decisions, identifying applicants who are particularly attractive to one college
and not the other. Thus, if there is relatively little new information in vij relative to yi,
College 2 will tend to do better in the equilibrium of Regime 1 than in the equilibrium of
Regime 2, but if the reverse is true and there is a great deal of new information in vij
relative to yi, then College 2 will tend to do better in the equilibrium of Regime 2.
E. Predictions of the Model about Repeat Applications
We now expand the model to allow for the possibility of repeat applications. Suppose
that there is some cost (incorporating the cost of time and effort required to participate in
another cycle of the application process) to become a repeat applicant and further that this
cost is sufficient to discourage anyone who is admitted to College 2 from turning down
that offer of admission for another opportunity to apply to College 1. Any student i who
applies and is not admitted (1) observes national exam score xi in Regime 1 and (2)
observes college specific values yi1 and yi2 in Regime 2M.
The incentive to return as a repeat applicant depends crucially on the relationship
between one’s admission values (xi, yi1, y12) from one year to (xi’, yi1’, yi2’) the next year.
We consider two illustrative cases to highlight the dynamics of the model in this context.

28

Case 1: All applicants retain exactly the same qualifications from year to year: xi’ = xi,
yi1 = yi1’, and y12’ = y12.
Case 2: All applicants get a completely new draw of qualifications, (xi’, yi1’, y12’) if they
return as repeat applicants.
Proposition 7: Assume that the distribution of new applicants is stationary from year to
year. In Case 1 some applicants would wish to return to the admission pool the next year
in Regime 1, but in Regime 2, no applicants would wish to do so. In Case 2, there would
be equal incentive in Regimes 1 and 2 for applicants who were not admitted in one year
to return to the admission pool the following year.
Proof: (1) In equilibrium in Regime 2, students who are not admitted early have the
opportunity to apply to both colleges as regular applicants. Given a stationary distribution
of new applicants each year, then the colleges will use the same admission thresholds
each year, and thus under the assumptions of Case 1, an applicant who is not admitted to
either college in one year would also not be admitted to either college in any subsequent
year. By contrast, in an equilibrium in Regime 1 where both colleges choose the same
admissions date, some students who apply and are rejected by College 1 with yC2 < yi <
yC1 would have an incentive to return the next year, expecting to gain admission to
College 2 under the assumptions of Case 1.
(2) Once again, given a stationary distribution of new applicants each year, then
the colleges will use the same admission thresholds each year, and thus under the
assumptions of Case 2, a repeat applicant would have the same unconditional probability
of admission to either college as the average new applicant (who does not yet know xi or
yi). Since each college will ultimately enroll K students, these unconditional probabilities
of enrolling at College 1 and separately at College 2 are the same for repeat applicants in
Regime 1 and in Regime 2, so their incentives to reapply are the same in the two regimes.
END OF PROOF

29

Part 1 of Proposition 7 provides theoretical justification for one official explanation for
the 1994 reform – that it was designed to reduce the number of repeat applicants. The
earlier system systematically resulted in congestion and strategic choice of the limited
number of applications available to students. In the language of the model, since students
have to target their applications on the basis of known xi values, but admission decisions
were based on yi values (incorporating student i’s score on the national exam) in Regime
1, in equilibrium, some students apply to College 2 even though they would have been
admitted by College 1. These students are presumably stuck at College 2, apart from the
possibility of transfer. But more conspicuously, some students who are rejected by
College 1 may discover after the fact that their yi values would have been sufficient for
admission by College 2; Proposition 7 indicates that these students would stand to gain in
a stationary world by returning to the applicant pool the next year.
Part 2 of Proposition 7 highlights a different motivation for repeat applications,
namely that students hope to improve their national exam score sufficiently to gain
admission to a college that was previously out of reach under any admissions regime.
Under the assumptions of Case 2, all reapplicants have equivalent chances of admission,
independent of the choice of regime.
Case 1 and Case 2 both represent extreme and unrealistic assumptions, for in
practice, there would always be some variation and also some consistency in exam
performance from year to year. Proposition 8 highlights the tension between these two
elements of performance, suggesting that the logic underlying the 1994 reforms was
premised, at least to some degree, on an assumption of consistent performance from year
to year.
But under the assumption of completely consistent performance, Proposition 8
also points out that congestion only limits the placement of a subset of applicants in
Regime 1 – those who apply only to College 1 and then subsequently discover that they
have sufficient qualifications for admission to College 2 but not to College 1. Yet, the
impact of this form of congestion is also limited by the endogenous choice of application
date by College 2. If College 2 is not very competitive with College 1, then there would
be a large gap in their admission cutoffs, but then College 2 would choose to offer a
different admissions date than College 1 in Regime 1, thereby making it possible for

30

applicants to apply to both colleges (and eliminating the possibility of congestion). Since
the closest competitors to Seoul National chose the same admissions date as Seoul
National in Regime 1, we conjecture that they were relatively competitive to Seoul
National, and thus that not that many applicants would have been affected by congestion
in Regime 1. In sum, this logic suggests that the 1993 reform may have only addressed
the more minor motivation for repeat applications – consistent with the finding that such
a large number of students returned as repeat applicants even after the reform.

31

V. Conclusion
The rules governing the application choices of students are paramount in college
admissions. The rules themselves are data, which allow the strategic game to be modeled
and studied. Further, the evolution of these rules over time can be viewed as a different
kind of data, as each rule change provides suggestive evidence of prior behavior by
students and colleges that prompted that rule change.

The South Korean college

admissions system is especially conducive to this approach because the national
government sets the rules in centralized fashion and because it has made several discrete
and substantive changes in the rules in recent years.
Given near-universal agreement on college rankings in South Korea, the default
outcome of the admissions process is for Seoul National to enroll almost all of the
applicants with the most outstanding credentials. Thus, competitors to Seoul National
have a strong motivation to try to undermine this outcome, in particular by adopting
policies that induce very good students to commit not to apply to Seoul National. The
results of our theoretical model are consistent with Stylized Facts #1 and #3, which
indicate that the next ranked competitors to Seoul National adopted different timing
strategies in Regimes 1 and 2. Specifically, these colleges chose the same application
date as Seoul National in Regime 1 (through 1993), then switched to aggressive use of
early application programs while choosing a different application date than Seoul
National for regular admissions in Regime 2 (1994 to 2001) and beyond,
In this regard, early application programs in South Korea and the United States
are similar in two ways. First, they serve as a vehicle for lower-ranked colleges to try to
attract talented students away from higher-ranked colleges. Second, though top-ranked
colleges such as Harvard, Princeton and Seoul National have attempted to opt out of early
admissions, competitive pressures have induced them to reconsider and ultimately to
admit substantial proportions of their entering classes through early admission programs.
One unique aspect of the history of early admissions in Korea is that regular
applications include a potentially important source of information – the idiosyncratic
exam given by each college – beyond the information available in an early application.
This highlights a paradoxical element of early admissions in the United States, namely
that “early” applications are not submitted at a markedly earlier time than regular
32

applications to most colleges, and so there is little if any difference in the content of early
and regular applications.
The introduction of early admissions in South Korea coincided with the change in
the timing of the national examination, which changed the information environment from
Regime 1 to Regime 2 in two ways. Given knowledge of their national exam score
before submitting applications in Regime 2, students can better predict whether they
would be admitted to Seoul National, limiting opportunities for other colleges to gain by
competing with Seoul National on the first date of regular applications. Perhaps even
more importantly, the introduction of idiosyncratic admissions exams attuned to each
college’s preferences reduced the adverse selection associated with multiple applications.
In Regime 1, a rejected application signals a poor score on the national exam,
thereby making that candidate much less attractive to other colleges. But in Regime 2, a
rejected application in regular admissions signals only a poor score on one college’s
idiosyncratic exam, which may have limited effect on the attractiveness of that candidate
to other colleges. Thus consistent with Stylized Fact 2, our theoretical results suggest
that these changes in information structure provided incentives for other colleges to
choose a different date for regular admissions than Seoul National, thereby allowing
students to apply to both colleges as regular applicants.
In sum, the 1994 South Korean college admission reforms can be seen as
increasing the efficiency of the assignment process in two ways. First, these reforms
reduced congestion, ensuring that all students could apply to at least three highly-ranked
colleges (once in early admissions and then on two different dates in regular admissions).
Second, this reform provided new information to colleges, enabling them to promote
specialized matches in their regular admission decisions. Nevertheless, the reforms had
little effect on the prevalence of repeat applications, suggesting that students were
primarily motivated by take a year off in order to apply to colleges all over again because
they were disappointment with the national exam results, not because they were
frustrated by the inefficiencies of a congested market. In addition, although the 1994
reforms opened up opportunities for students as regular applicants, they also opened
another channel – early admissions – that other colleges have used progressively more
aggressively over time to compete with Seoul National for applicants.

Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1:
In equilibrium, each college j receives applications from some set of students, and
observes the yi values but not the vij values for those applicants. Given this information,
it maximizes the quality of the entering class conditional on this applicant pool by
admitting applicants with the highest yi values until filling its class with K admitted
students (or admitting all applicants if it receives fewer than K applications). That is, in
any equilibrium, each college must use a threshold rule for admission, where College 1
admits applicants with yi > yC1 and College 2 admits applicants with yi > yC2. Further, it
must be that yC1 > yC2, as otherwise, all students will apply to College 1 and not to
College 2, which would be a contradiction because College 2 should set yC2 = 0
(admitting all applicants) if it receives fewer than K applications.
Given fixed admission thresholds yC1, yC2, student i applies to College 1 rather
than College 2 if
OR

u1 P(yi > yC1 | xi = x)

>

u2 P(yi > yC2 | xi = x)

P(yi > yC1 | xi = x) / P(yi > yC2 | xi = x)

>

u2.

By MLRP Property 4, the ratio P(yi > yC1 | xi = x) / Px(yi > yC2 | xi = x) is increasing in x
for fixed admission thresholds yC1 and yC2 with yC1 > yC2. Thus, only students with the
highest national exam scores would choose to apply to College 1 when it is only possible
to apply to a single college. This shows that any equilibrium must involve thresholds and
monotonic applications / admissions decisions for both students and colleges, but does
not prove the existence of an equilibrium.
Define functions yC1(x) and yC2(x) to be the threshold values for Colleges 1 and 2
to fill their classes when students apply to College 1 iff xi > x. (To complete this
definition, we set yCj(x) to 0 if a threshold value of x for applications causes college j to
receive less than K applications, in which case it admits all applicants). Then an increase
in x shifts some applicants from College 1 to College 2, so yC1(x) is decreasing in x while
yC2(x) is increasing in x, and both functions are strictly monotonic except for values of x
where a given college admits all applicants.

36

Now consider two potential threshold values in x, x* and x**, where x** > x*.
By MLRP Property 4, given fixed thresholds yC1(x*) and yC2(x*), we know that
P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = x**) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi = x**)
>

P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = x*) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi = x*).

(1)

Further, since yC1(x) is decreasing in x, P(yi > yC1(x**) | xi = x**)) > P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi =
x**)), and since yC2(x) is decreasing in x, P(yi < yC2(x**) | xi = x**)). Substituting these
relationships in (1) gives
P(yi > yC1(x**) | xi = x**) / P(yi > yC2(x**) | xi = x**)
>

P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = x*) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi = x*).

(2)

This shows that the ratio P(yi > yC1(x) | xi = x) / P(yi > yC2(x) | xi = x) is strictly increasing
in x. The condition for a equilibrium with application threshold x* is
P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = x*) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi = x*)

=

u2.

(3)

Since the left-hand side of (3) is strictly increasing in x*, there can be at most one such
equilibrium.
If P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = 0) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi =0) > u2, then condition (3) can
never be satisfied for any value of x* > 0 and there is a unique equilibrium where all
students apply to College 1 despite the fact that College 2 will admit anyone who applies.
So assume instead that P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = 0) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi =0) < u2. If all
applicants apply to College 2, then College 2 must set admission threshold below 1,
whereas College 1 will set admission threshold equal to zero and admit all applicants.
Thus,
P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = 1) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi =1) > 1 > u2.
Since P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = x) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi = x) starts off below u2 at x = 0, ends up
above u2 at x = 1, and is continuous and strictly increasing in x, there must be a unique
value x = x* between 0 and 1 such that P(yi > yC1(x*) | xi = x*) / P(yi > yC2(x*) | xi =x*)
= u2. This value x* is the unique equilibrium threshold for applications. Thus, we can
view the application threshold x* as an implicit function of u2, and further we can view
the admission thresholds yC1(x*) and yC2(x*) as implicit functions of u2 as well.

37

Proof of Proposition 4:
The proof relies on an additional Lemma, which shows that both colleges adopt lower
thresholds for early admission in Regime 2S than in Regime 2M, thereby competing
more aggressively in the early admission phase of Regime 2S than 2M. The intuition for
Lemma 4 is straightforward: since the colleges both achieve higher utility in Regime 2M
than Regime 2S in a world without early admissions, they have less incentive to admit
any particular early applicant in Regime 2M.
Lemma 4: Comparing any equilibrium (e1M, r1M, e2M, r2M) in Regime 2M to the unique
equilibrium (e1S, r1S, e2S, r2S) in Regime 2S, we have e1M > e1S and e2M > e2S.
Proof: First suppose e1S > e1M. Since r1 = E(vi1 | s = e1) for each admission rule, then r1S
> r1M. If e2M > e2S, then college 1 would admit more early applicants with rule M,
receive and admit more regular applicants with rule M than rule S, so would overenroll
with rule M. So it must be that e2M < e2S and in turn r2M < r2S, since college 2 adjusts its
regular threshold down as a result of adverse selection with the Multiple Application rule,
but does not do so for the Single Application rule. So in this case e1S > e1M, r1S > r1M, e2S
> e2M and r2S > r2M, i.e. the colleges use weaker thresholds for admission throughout with
rule M than with rule S. But the regular applicants get to apply to both colleges with rule
M and only to one college with rule S, so this means that the colleges must overenroll
with rule M. So this is not possible.

By similar reasoning, we can rule out the

possibility that e2S > e2M. END OF PROOF OF LEMMA
Suppose that in Regime 2M, College 1 follows equilibrium strategy (e1M, r1M). In
response, College 2 could choose an admission rule to admit the same number of early
applicants that it would admit in the unique equilibrium in Regime 2S. That is, it could
choose early admission threshold e’2M where e’2M is defined implicitly by the equation
P(s > e1M) - P(s > e’2M)

=

P(s > e1S) - P(s > e2S)

By Lemma 5, e1M > e1S and e’2M > e2S. So by construction, College 2 admits the same
number of early applicants in each case, but gets a higher average payoff from them in

38

regime 2M than in regime 2S. Further, in regime 2M, College 1 admits measure K of
applicants from two groups of students:
(1) those with yi > e1M;
(2) students with the highest vi2-values among those with yi < e’2M
Similarly, in Regime 2S, College 1 admits measure K of applicants from two groups of
students:
(1) those with yi > e1S;
(2) students with the highest vi1-values among those with yi < e’2S
College 2 only cares about the yi-values of its regular applicants, not their vi1 values once
yi values are known. The worst case scenario for College 2 in Regime 2M is that College
1 fills its class with the regular applicants with highest yi-values, so that College 2 has a
regular pool with students who have yi-values between 0 and e2M.

By contrast, in

Regime 2S, the regular applicants with the highest values of yi apply to College 1, while
the others apply to College 2. The best case scenario for College 2 in Regime S is then
that College 1 receives just enough applicants in regular admissions to fill its class. Then
once again College 2 has a regular pool with students who have yi-values between 0 and
e2M.
In sum, if College 2 simply chooses to admit the same number of early applicants
in Regime 2M as it does in the unique equilibrium of Regime 2S, it gets a better
distribution of early admits in Regime 2M (because e1M > e1S, i.e. College 1 is more
selective in its early admits) and does at least as well in regular admissions in Regime 2M
as in Regime 2S. By revealed preference, College 2 prefers its outcome in Regime 2M
than in Regime 2S and will choose a different regular admissions date than College 1 in
Regime 2.
