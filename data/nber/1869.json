We find that ther esponse of saving to tariffs issensitive to the modelling of saving behavior. In a model in which Consumers' discount rate varies endogenously (in the Uzawa preference form), saving fallswith higher tariffs. This result may, however, be reversed in the Blanchard-Yaarj type model in which consumers have uncertain lifetimes. We find that in both models the response of saving depends on a production distortion effect which changes steady-state income and an effect on steady-state expenditures.\n\n",
