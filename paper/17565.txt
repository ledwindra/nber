Ownership Characteristics, Real Exchange Rate Movements and Labor Market Adjustment
in China

NBER Working Paper No. 17565
November 2011
JEL No. F16,F31,J21,J31
ABSTRACT
This paper uses a firm level multi-industry data set covering 456 Chinese manufacturing sectors to
assess the implications of Renminbi (RMB) real exchange rate appreciation for adjustments in employment
and wage rates. We stress differences in both industry and firm characteristics within sectors. Our
empirical results show that modest (and also larger) RMB real exchange rate appreciation would likely
have pronounced effects on both net employment and wage rates. A 10% RMB appreciation would
likely cause a net employment decline in Chinese manufacturing industries of between 4.1% and 5.3%,
and a wage rate drop of 4% after controlling for other factors. Real exchange rate change effects by
industry on net employment and wage rates vary significantly with the ownership characteristics of
firms within industries. Employment and wage rates for private enterprises are less responsive to RMB
real exchange rate fluctuations than is true for state owned enterprises (SOEs) and foreign invested
enterprises (FIEs). This finding is opposite to the widely held belief that the labor market behavior
of Chinese SOEs shows stronger labor market rigidities than for private firms. Impacts of exchange
rate movements emerge as systematically related to export openness, overall import penetration and
profit margins of individual manufacturing industries.

1. Introduction
Recent empirical studies on the labor market implications of exchange rate change
typically find a significant relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and labor
market adjustments in a number of countries, but these relationships vary by industry.
Several studies find significant and large impacts of real exchange rate changes on net
employment.(Branson and Love ,1988; Revenga ,1992; Dekle,1998; Leung and
Yuen,2007; Hua,2007; Nucci and Pozzolo,2010). Others show that wage rates are
typically more responsive to real exchange rate movements than employment
(Goldberg and Tracy,2001; Campa and Goldberg ,2001). Few studies for China have
explored the reverse causality of RMB exchange rate change effects on wage rates of
Chinese industries, although several studies focus on analyzing and testing the
significance of Balassa-Samuelson effects and implied wage rates adjustments for
RMB real exchange rate change (McKinnon, 2005; McKinnon and Schnabl, 2006).
In this paper, we investigate both the impact of real exchange changes on labor
market adjustments for individual Chinese manufacturing industries and the role of
firm ownership characteristics. We use a panel data set covering 456 four digit
industries over the period 2001 to 2009 to evaluate the effects of exchange rate changes
on labor market behavior taking into account trends of RMB real exchange rate
changes by industry before and after the reform of RMB exchange rate regime in July,
2005. Instead of using an aggregate RMB real effective exchange rate, we construct
industry specific real effective exchange rates for 163 three digit industries over the
period 2001 to 2009 which we apply to our four digit industry data. We specify
dynamic employment and wage equations which capture the labor market adjustment
process and duration of exchange rate changes so as to fully capture impacts of
exchange rate movements on net employment and wage rates in both the short and
long run.
We find that the RMB real exchange rate movements can have substantial effects
on wage rates and net employment simultaneously. A 10% appreciation of the RMB
real exchange rate will cause effect in net employment about 4.1% to 5.3%, and wage
rates will also decline about 4% with the same appreciation. Our empirical results
2

consistently show that the impact of RMB real exchange rate movements on wage and
employment are systematically associated with export openness, overall import
penetration and ownership characteristics of Chinese manufacturing industries. The
magnitude of exchange rate movement effects on employment is also systematically
related to the profit margins of manufacturing industries.
Our results suggest that the labor market behavior of private enterprises is less
responsive to exchange rate fluctuations than SOEs. We also show that exchange rate
movements can have larger effects on the labor market activity of SOEs and FIEs than
private firms even after we control for the different profit margins of industries and the
effects of exchange rate movements on labor market through other trade channels.
Alexandre, et al.,(2010) have earlier noted that institutional factors can substantially
influence the pass-through effects of exchange rate on domestic prices and output due
to rigidities and different adjustment costs in labor market . Other studies of Chinese
SOEs (Buckley, et al., 2007, Hale and Long, 2008) generally imply that the labor
market activity of SOEs is less likely to be affected by real exchange rate shocks
because wage determination and hiring by SOEs is less market based and more
regulated by government policy. They also argue that SOEs are more likely to obtain
financial support from the government and also more likely to be immune to price and
exchange rate movements. Also, and in contrast to private enterprises, most SOEs have
higher hiring or firing costs due to a higher percentage of formal employment and
stronger labor market regulation. SOEs have lower average profit margins than private
enterprises and FIEs also influence their labor market behavior. With low profit
margins, SOEs are also more likely to be driven out of the market and experience
bankruptcy with increased market competition ①. Thus existing literature also suggests
it is possible that real exchange rate appreciation can have more significant and larger
effects on SOEs than Non-SOEs.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide background and
Summary statistics for the empirical sample we use later show that the average profit to sales margins of SOEs,
private enterprises and FIEs in 456 four digit industries are -1.67%, 5.32% and 6.05% respectively over the period
2001 to 2009; The market share of SOEs declines consistently from 18.4% in 2001 to 5.5% in 2009, while the
market share of private enterprise increases from 14.5% to 39.8%. The market share of FIEs is relatively stable at
around 30% over the same period.

and employment equations. Section 4 presents empirical findings and discusses their
possible implications. Section 5 provides conclusions.

2. Background and Theoretical Literature`
Existing literature does not provide conclusive evidence that real exchange rate
change is associated with significant employment and wage adjustments but most
available studies point in this direction. Branson and Love (1988) found that real
exchange rate U.S. dollar appreciation would cause significant output and employment
loss, and Revenga (1992), using three and four digit data for manufacturing industries
of U.S. over the 1977-1987 period, also found that real exchange fluctuations can have
significant impacts on employment and small but also significant impact on wage.
Leung and Yuen (2007), using 21 manufacturing industries over the 1981-1997 period,
explored the real exchange rate effects on Canadian labor market adjustment and also
found evidence indicating that exchange movements have a substantial effects on
employment and those effects increase with the trade openness, while the exchange
rate change effects on real wages were estimated to be virtually zero. Using data for 29
Chinese provinces over the period 1993–2002, Hua (2007) explored the channels of
effects for RMB real exchange rate change on employment of manufacturing industries
and concluded that real exchange rate change had significant and substantial effects on
employment.
Available studies also provide evidence that wage rates are more responsive to
real exchange rate movements than employment and exchange rate movement impacts
on net employment are smaller. Using two decades of two digit and four digit industry
level data of U.S., Campa and Goldberg (2001) found exchange rates have significant
and substantial effects on wage rates by industries, with the magnitude of wage effects
rising as industries increased their export orientation and declining as imported input
were intensively used. They did not find a pronounced impact of real exchange rate on
4

net employment. Goldberg and Tracy(2001) also provide evidence that wage rates can
be responsive to exchange movements during the job transitions by considering labor
supply effects caused by the exchange rate fluctuations.
In our investigation of the effects of RMB appreciation on Chinese manufacturing
employment and wages, we use a dynamic model which captures equilibrium
employment and wage rate adjustments to real exchange rate shocks. Exchange rate
fluctuations typically affect labor demand through two direct channels. Through the
output channel, real exchange shocks change the relative price of domestic and foreign
products and the level of domestic output and employment will change accordingly.
They also have impact through the imported input or import competition channel. An
appreciation (depreciation) of real exchange rate can decrease (increase) the cost of
imported inputs and the price of imported final products. Depending on the degree of
substitutability between domestic and imported goods, output and employment of
domestic industries can be impacted in different ways.
The degree of responsiveness of output and employment to exchange rate shocks
depends crucially on pass through effects of exchange rate change to domestic and
foreign prices. Market structure matters because, in a competitive market, firms have
limited ability to set prices and firms’ output is affected by changes of foreign prices.
Thus in a monopolistically competitive environment and with extensive production
differentiation and market power, exchange rate shocks on output and employment can
be partially offset by changed price setting. Trade orientation matters because exchange
rates shocks and with them pass-through on to foreign demand are proportional to
export openness. The pass-through on output and employment of exchange rate shocks
through import channel depends on the degree of import penetration and
substitutability between domestic products and imported goods.
The regulatory environment can also play an important role. If domestic industries
are protected or supported by the government policies, relative prices, costs and the
market share of domestic industries may not change with an exchange rate shock.
Labor market regulations may also affect the speed of adjustment of employment to
relative cost changes caused by exchange rate shocks. If costs of labor hiring or firing
5

and output adjustment are large due to labor market regulation, firms will be reluctant
to make large changes in employment in an uncertain duration. All these factors
together influence the responsiveness of employment and wage rates to real exchange
shocks.
The relationship between labor demand and exchange rates we use was originally
developed by Klein, et al.(2003). They assume that in the presence of trade openness,
exchange rate fluctuations are assumed to influence the output demand of industries
according to the form,

Where 𝑄𝑖𝑖
is the output demand for industry 𝑖 at time t, and 𝛿𝑖 is the demand

shock facing industry 𝑖. Outputs of domestic industries are determined by income. 𝑌𝑖𝑖

is the total domestic factor return originating in the industry 𝑖 at time t, and 𝑌𝑗𝑗∗ is a

multiplicative factor for each foreign country’s income, which is negatively related to
the bilateral real exchange rate 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗 . The pass-through effects of real exchange rates

and foreign incomes on domestic output demand is assumed proportional to trade

openness and other characteristics of each industry(Ω𝑖 ). Finally, the contribution of
𝑖
each trading partner is weighted by its share in total sector trade 𝜔𝑗𝑗
.

The cost function for each sector 𝑖 at time 𝑡 is,
𝐷
𝐶𝑖𝑖 (𝑊, 𝑅; 𝑄) = 𝑊𝑖𝑖𝛼 𝑅𝑡1−𝛼 𝑄𝑖𝑖

where 𝑊𝑖𝑖 is the average wage of industry 𝑖, 𝑅𝑡 is the unit cost of non-labor

is the domestic output of industry 𝑖.

Labor demand for industry 𝑖 is the partial derivative of the cost function with

Current employment level is assumed to be best predictor of all future
employment, and we assume an employment adjustment equation by industry given as,
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 = 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝐿𝑖𝑖−1 + (1 − 𝜆)𝐿𝐿𝐿∗𝑖𝑖

(5)

In this case, a general form for the labor demand is given by,

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 = 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝐿𝑖𝑖−1 + (1 − 𝜆) �

−Ω𝑖 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 + Ω𝑖 𝛽𝑌𝑖𝑖∗

(6)

However, to evaluate how real exchange rate movements affect labor markets, we
also need to consider the impact of real exchange rate shocks on wage adjustments and
this introduces labor supply considerations. We assume labor supply for industry i at
time t is

𝐿𝑖𝑖 = �𝑊 ∗𝜀

where 𝑊𝑖𝑖∗ is the average wage of industries alternative to industry i , γ is a

measure of the labor supply elasticity (γ > 0) and 𝜀 is the cross-elasticity of labor
supply with respect to wage rates between sector 𝑖 and other industries.

To capture the wage spillover effects across different industries through labor

supply channels, we use average wage rates of other four digit industries to represent
the prevailing wage of industries alternative to industry i ①.Equating labor demand and
labor supply equations, we can derive both the employment and wages equation in
equilibrium for industry space 𝑖 . We use industry dummies to control for time
invariant fixed effects, (𝐿𝐿𝛿𝑖 ) and time dummies to control for other macroeconomic
factors ( 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑡 ). Taking into account dynamic impacts of exchange rate fluctuations on

labor market; we also control the lagged variables of real exchange rate in our
empirical equations. The reduced form of the wage and employment equations by

+ 𝛿5 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖−1 + 𝑓𝑖 + 𝑓𝑡

(8)

where 𝑓𝑖 and 𝑓𝑡 represent individual and time fixed effects in individual industries.
The impacts of real exchange rate and foreign income changes on labor market

behavior depend on pass-through effects. In our analysis above, Ω𝑖 is determined by

many factors, including export openness, imported input and imported final product
penetration rates, the market structure and ownership characteristics of the industries .

To analyze whether real exchange rate effects on labor market are systematically
related to these factors, we specify Ω𝑖 = Ω𝑖 (𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖 , 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 , 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖 , 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖 ) based on the

analysis above, where 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖 and 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 represent average export openness and overall

import penetration rates over the period 2001 to 2009 for industry 𝑖 respectively ① ,
and where 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖 and 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖 represent average profit margins and ownership
characteristics of industries over the same period.

We use these two variables to investigate linkage between exchange rate change
effects and labor markets from market structure and institutional factors of labor
market. Taking into account heterogeneity issues in estimation, we estimate differenced
equations instead of level equations to evaluate these effects.
Our final wage and employment equations therefore reduce to,

Δ𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 Δ𝐿𝐿𝑌𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽2 𝑇𝑇𝑖 ∗ Δ𝐿𝐿𝑌𝑖𝑖∗ + 𝛽3 Δ𝐿𝐿𝑊𝑖𝑖∗ + Ω𝑖 �𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖 � ∗

To capture dynamic effects of real exchange rate changes on labor market, we control current and lagged
interactive variable of exchange rate and trade dependence simultaneously. To overcome the simultaneity issue
of exchange rate and trade dependence and the random movements of trade dependence in different periods, we
use average export openness and average import penetration rates instead of time variant variables for trade
dependence.

3. Data , Summary Statistics and Model Identification
3.1 Data and summary statistics
We use industry level data covering 456 four digit manufacturing industries over
the time period of 2001 to 2009. Data are drawn from the industrial database of China
supported by National Bureau of Statistics of China. The database provides over 65
financial variables for each industry, including value added in production, export sales,
wage rates and employment levels, and the ratio of net profits of sales. To link to the
industry level trade data between China and its 41 bilateral trading partners, we
construct a correspondence between HS four digit codes for 1250 trade products and
industry codes for 175 three digit manufacturing industries in China ②. Bilateral trade
data classified at a HS 4 digit product level between China and 41 trading partners over
the period of 1999 to 2009 are drawn from International Trade Statistics (ITS) and
COMTRADE database of United Nations. Real GDP data for 41 trading partners and
the CPI index and bilateral nominal exchange rate for China and 41 trading partners
are all drawn from International Financial Statistics, IMF. To investigate the
relationship between competitive market structures of industries and real exchange rate
effects on labor markets, we divide the sample into low price over cost markup
industries and high price over cost markup industries using data to average profit
margins of industries over the period 2001 to 2009.
Table1 presents summary statistics for our sample, including indices of total
employment, average wage paid, export sales and profit margins for different
ownership industries. These descriptive statistics indicate that average profit margins
This paper investigate the relationship between exchange rate and labor market adjustments, and to simplify
model identification and estimation, we here only estimate the interactive effects of foreign income and overall
trade openness on labor markets and do not investigate the interactive effects of foreign income and other
characteristic of industries.

of SOEs are lower than for Non-SOEs over the whole period, and that export values
and export openness for FIEs are higher than for SOEs and private enterprises.
TABLE 1 HERE

The figures below show selected three digit industry specific real exchange rates
of RMB from the year 2001 to 2009. There is substantial heterogeneity in the behavior
of these real exchange rates at industry level. Most industry specific real exchange
rates of RMB depreciate continuously from 2001 to 2004 and appreciate overall from
2005 to 2009. However, the fluctuation of these real exchange rates varies substantially
both within and across industries. The real exchange rate variation within chemical
industries is smaller than for food and sport article industries, while real exchange rate
movements for specific sectors are different from most other sectors.

3.2 Identification Methods for Wage and Employment Equations.
For the wage and employment equations specified in section 2, we cannot use
OLS and random estimators because the predetermined variables in employment
equations and other endogenous variables in both wage and employment equations are
correlated with the individual effects𝑓𝑖 . The fixed effect estimator can eliminate the
individual effects by transforming data into deviations from the within group mean, but
it is still biased because the group mean of predetermined and other endogenous
variable is still correlated with mean of the error terms. The generalized moment
method (GMM) and Panel IV (2SLS/GMM) estimators are frequently adopted
measures to identify the dynamic panel data model and to control for the endogeneity
issues.
We use two-step system GMM estimators (Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell
and Bond, 1998) instead of difference GMM estimators to identify our dynamic
employment equation.

We also control for the adjustment processes of employment

and other endogenous variables. Wage equations are identified using both Panel IV
(2SLS) and Panel IV (GMM) estimators to control for endogeneity. As endogeneity
tests of variables when applying the Panel IV estimators, two variables
(Δ𝐿𝐿𝑌𝑖𝑖 𝑎𝑎𝑎 ∆𝐿𝐿𝑊𝑖𝑖∗ ) are set as endogenous variables both in the employment and

10

wage equations. The lagged level and lagged difference endogenous variables and
other exogenous variables are then set as the instruments for those endogenous
variables.

4. Empirical Results
4.1 Trade Openness, Profit Margins and Real Exchange Rate Effects on Employment

We first report results on the links between real exchange rate changes and
employment taking into account export openness, overall import penetration and profit
margins by industries. These are reported in Table2.
In column 1 of table 2, employment equations are estimated using the full sample
and coefficients indicate that the adjustment process of labor market is significant and
the previous employment levels have positive and significant effects on current net
employment. Both the domestic and foreign income have significant and positive
effects on net employment. The foreign income effects on employment are also
systematically related to the average trade openness of industries. The coefficient of
the wage rate for the alternative industries is also positively significant, which fits the
theoretical prediction that the relative demand of labor will increase in the specific
sector when the wage rates of other sectors increase.
Estimation results also show that exchange rate change effects on employment are
crucially dependent on the export openness. All interactive variables of export
openness and exchange rates are negatively significant at a 1% level. The real
exchange rate change has substantial effects on net employment in highly export
oriented sectors, while interactive variables of import penetration and exchange rate
are also significant. The impact of exchange rate movements on employment through
overall import penetration channels is smaller. This is because the relationship between
domestic output and imported inputs is more likely to be complimentary, while the
relationship between domestic output and imported final products is substitutable and
competitive. The impacts of exchange rate movements on employment through both
import input and import competition mechanisms (overall import penetration) seem
minimal due to the offsetting forces. According to the estimated coefficients in column
11

1, a 10% appreciation of RMB real exchange rate will result in a 4.15% reduction in
overall net employment in Chinese manufacturing industries in the short run, while this
impact could reach 5.32% in the long run after controlling for other factors.
To check whether profit margins can significantly influence the pass-through
effects of exchange rate movements on employment, we also divide the sample into
two subsamples based on average profit margins of industries. The results, using the
two separate subsamples, are reported in columns 2 and 3 of Table2. The coefficients
of interactive variables indicate that real exchange rate movements can have significant
effects on high profit margin sectors, through the export openness channel, while the
exchange rate change can have significant and larger effects on low profit margin
sectors through both export openness and import penetration channels.
The coefficient of lagged employment variable is negative and insignificant in
high profit margin sectors, while the coefficient of the same variable is positive in low
profit margin sectors. The different results for this coefficient in different sectors imply
that the magnitude of employment adjustments can be larger in low profit margin
sectors. According to the estimation results reported in columns 2 and 3 of Table 2, a
10% appreciation in the real exchange rate will cause net employment level in high
profit margin sectors to drop by about 2.3%, while in the low profit margin sectors, a
10% appreciation of real exchange rate will result in a 4.4% reduction in net
employment in the short run. Costs will increase by around 11.8% due to substantial
employment adjustments in the long run.
To check the robustness of the results reported in columns 2 and 3, the interactive
variables of profit margins and real exchange rate are also estimated using the full data
sample after controlling for all other interactive variables in column 4. The coefficients
of interactive variables in column 4 show that the impacts of real exchange rate
movements on employment are systematically associated with the profit margins of
industries. The negative impact of exchange rate appreciation on employment
decreases with the growth of profit margins of the industries, consistent with the
empirical results shown in column 2 and 3.
Taking into account the possible endogeneity of interactive variables, we also
12

estimate the lagged interactive variables in column 5 after controlling for other
variables. The coefficients and significance of lagged interactive variables in column 5
does not change much compared to those estimation results in columns 1 and 4. These
show that the impacts of RMB real exchange rate movements on employment are
systematically related to export openness, import penetration and profit margins of
Chinese manufacturing industries.
TABLE 2 HERE
4.2 Ownership Characteristics and Real Exchange Rate Effects on Employment
To analyze whether institutional factors and labor market regulation can influence
real exchange rate change effects on industrial employment, we also investigate the
link between exchange rate movement effects on employment and ownership
characteristics of manufacturing industries. We use the shares of production by SOEs,
private enterprises, and FIEs with industries to reflect the ownership structure of
different industries. Exchange rate change effects on net employment of different
ownership enterprises are also evaluated using the interactive variable of exchange
rates and the shares of production of different ownership enterprises.
Results are reported in Table 3.

In columns 1 and 2 of Table 3, the coefficients

of interactive variables of exchange rates and shares of SOEs are all negatively
significant at 5%, even after controlling for the pass-through effects of exchange rate
changes on employment through export openness, import penetration channel and for
different profit margins industries. These results also indicate the negative impacts of
exchange rate appreciation on employment increase with an increased share of SOEs in
Chinese manufacturing industries.
In columns 3 and 4, the coefficients of interactive variables of exchange rates and
shares of private enterprises are all positively significant at the5% level after
controlling for all other variables as in columns 1 and 2. These results also imply that
the negative impact of exchange rate appreciation on employment decreases with an
increased share of private enterprise.

To further check the robustness of the results in

columns 1 to 4, we also control all the interactive variables for exchange rate and
shares of different enterprises in column 5. Results in column 5 remain consistent with
13

the results reported in columns 1 to 4.
In column 6, we investigate the relationship between exchange rate effects on net
employment and shares of FIEs. The coefficients for the interactive variables of
exchange rates and shares of FIEs are all negatively significant at a 5% level ①.
Results show that the negative impact of RMB exchange rate appreciation on net
employment also increases with the higher shares of FIEs in manufacturing industries.
All the above regression results above imply that the net employment of SOEs and
FIEs is more responsive to RMB real exchange movements than is true for private
enterprises, and that the impacts of RMB real exchange rates on net employment are
also systematically associated with the ownership characteristic of Chinese industries.
It is understandable that the net employment of FIEs is more responsive to the
RMB real exchange rate because most FIEs in Chinese manufacturing industries are
concentrated in export oriented sectors. The average export openness for FIEs is also
much higher than for SOEs and private enterprises. The magnitude of exchange rate
movements on net employment of FIEs through export channel can also be more
substantial. However, it is contrary to the prediction that private enterprises are more
responsive to exchange rate movements than SOEs due to low percentages of formal
employment for private enterprises and stronger rigidities or regulations in labor
markets for SOEs.
A possible explanation for these results is that the marketing performance and
efficiency and average profit margins of SOEs in manufacturing industries are lower
than those of private enterprises. SOEs have less price-setting ability and less
flexibility to adjust their output structure to counteract the negative effects of exchange
rate movements. SOEs are also more likely to be driven out of the market and cause a
substantial loss of net employment with growing market competition due to exchange
rate appreciation. Thus, the overall impact of exchange rate movements on labor
market behavior of SOEs can be more substantial than for private enterprises in the
long run.
In column 6 of table 3, the interactive variables of export openness and real exchange rate are not controlled
due to the multicollinearity issues. The correlation coefficient between the share of FIEs and export openness is
over 0.85.

4.3 Trade Openness, Profit Margins and Real Exchange Rate Effects on Wage Rates

We next evaluate the impact of RMB real exchange rate movements on wage rates
of Chinese manufacturing industries. The wage equations specified in section 3 are
identified using Panel IV fixed effect estimators and results are reported in Table 4.
In column 1 of table 4, we report results investigating the link between real
exchange rate movement effects on wage rates and average export openness, overall
import penetration and profit margins of manufacturing industries. Results indicate that
domestic and foreign incomes can both have positive and significant effects on wage
rates, and that pass-through effects of foreign income on wage rates are systematically
associated with trade dependence by industry; growth on average wage rates in
alternative industries can also have positive and significant effects on specific industry
implying that there are positive and significant wage spillovers across different
industries.
Coefficients of the interactive variables of export openness and real exchange
rates are all negatively significant, and the coefficients of lagged interactive variables
of import penetration rates and real exchange rates are also negative and significant.
Results for these interactive variables consistently show that the impacts of real
exchange rate movements on wage rates are systematically associated with export
openness and import penetration by industry. The negative impacts of real exchange
rate appreciation strengthen with the expansion of export openness and import
penetration rates, while exchange rate change effects on wage rates are more
substantial through export openness than import penetration channels. According to the
estimated coefficients for interactive variables, a 10% appreciation of RMB real
exchange rate will cause average wage rates in Chinese manufacturing industries to
drop by 3.8% after controlling for other variables. Real exchange rate movements can
thus have substantial effects on wage rates, and the mechanisms and channels of
exchange rate change effect on wage rates and employment are similar.
In columns 2 and 3 of table 4, we report results which explore the different
impacts of exchange rate movements on wage rates in low and high profit margins
15

industries respectively. These results show that exchange rate movements can have
significant impacts on wage rates through both export openness and import penetration
mechanisms in high profit margin industries, while exchange rate change effects on
low profit margin industries take place only through export openness. The impact of
exchange rates on wage rates in high profit margin industries is more substantial than
the impact in low profit margin industries. A 10% appreciation of real exchange rates
will cause average wage rates in high profit margin industries to drop by 4.5% while
average wage rate decline in low profit margin industries by 2.4%.
In column 4 of table 4, we use the interactive variables of average profit margins
of industries and real exchange rate to check whether the impacts of exchange rate
movements on wage rates are also systematically related to the profit margins of
manufacturing industries. The interactive variables of exchange rates and profit
margins are all insignificant. There is no clear evidence that exchange rate movement
effects on wage rates depend on the profit margins of the industries.
To further check the robustness of the results in columns 1 to 4, we also use the
more efficient feasible GMM estimators to identify the wage equations. The results in
column 5 and 6 are similar to those results in columns 1 and 4. All these results
consistently show that exchange rate movements can have substantial effects on wage
rates adjustment, and the impacts of exchange rate change on wage rate are also
systematically associated with export openness and overall import penetration rates of
industries.
TABLE 4 HERE
4.4 Ownership Characteristics and Real Exchange Rate Effects on Wage Rates

Institutional factors and labor market regulations are also likely to influence the
responsiveness of wage rates to exchange rate fluctuations. We thus also investigate the
link between exchange rate movement effects on wage rates with the ownership
characteristics of industries. Results are reported in Table 5. In column 1 of Table5, the
interactive variables of exchange rates and shares of SOEs are insignificant after
controlling for other variables. Result also shows that there is no significant difference
in impacts of exchange rate movements on wages rates between SOEs and overall
16

enterprises. In column 2, interactive variables of exchange rates and shares of private
enterprises are all positively significant. Result indicates that the responsiveness of
wage rates to exchange rate movements declines with the increase share of private
enterprises. The wage rates of private enterprises are less sensitive to real exchange
rate movements than is true for other enterprises. In column 3, interactive variables of
exchange rates and shares of FIEs are all negatively significant after controlling for all
other variables. Empirical results indicate that wage rates of FIEs are more responsive
to real exchange rates than is true for other enterprises. The negative effects of real
exchange rate appreciation on wage rates thus increase with the increased share of
FIEs.
To take into account the possible reverse causality of wage rates change and real
exchange rate movements （Balassa-Samuelson effects) , we can only control and
estimate the lagged interactive variables and other variables . The results in column 4
and 5 still indicate a systematic relationship between the impacts of exchange rate
movements on wage rates and the ownership characteristic of the industries. The
negative impacts of exchange rate appreciation on wage rates increase with the growth
share of FIEs which decline with the growth share of private enterprises. In column 6,
we control all the interactive variables simultaneously in the wage equations to further
check the robustness. The results in column 6 indicate the same conclusion as for the
results in columns 1 to 5.
The above results and also those in Table 3 all consistently show that the
employment and wage rates of FIEs and SOEs are both more responsive to exchange
rate movements than is true for private enterprises. Possible reasons are that, FIEs are
more profit and export oriented; FIEs are more sensitive to the exchange rate
fluctuations and more likely to adjustment the wage rates and employment level to
counteract the negative effects of exchange rate shocks and keep relative stable profit
margins of their operation, while private enterprises are more domestic market oriented
than FIEs and they are more willing to keep a relative stable labor market and adjust
profit margins in response to the exchange rate shocks. Due to the lower efficiency and
performance, SOEs also have relatively little room to adjust their profit margins and
17

are more likely to go bankrupt with an increase in exchange rate fluctuations in the
long run. The magnitudes of labor market adjustments of SOEs are thus likely to be
greater than for private enterprises.
TABLE 5 HERE
5. Conclusion
This study investigates the effects of possible RMB appreciation on both
employment and wages in China, and also the link between exchange rate movement
effects on labor market and ownership characteristics of the industries. Using a
representative sample covering 456 four digit Chinese manufacturing industries over
the period of 2001 to 2009, we find that the impacts of exchange rate change on labor
market crucially depends on the ownership characteristics of the industries. The labor
market behavior of SOEs and FIEs are more responsive to exchange rate movements
than is true for private enterprises. This is contrary to the common belief that the less
export oriented and less market based SOEs are not more responsive to real exchange
rate fluctuations than private enterprises. It appears that FIEs are more likely to adjust
wage and employment levels to counteract negative effects of exchange rate
appreciations on their profit margins, while private enterprises tends to adjust their
profit margins to keep a relative stable labor market. SOEs are more prone to be driven
out of the market with a real exchange rate appreciation.
In contrast to previous studies, we also find that the RMB real exchange rate
movements can have substantial effects on wage rates and net employment
simultaneously. A 10% appreciation of the RMB real exchange rate will cause effect in
net employment about 4.1% to 5.3%, and wage rates will also decline about 4% with
the same appreciation. Our empirical results consistently show that the impact of RMB
real exchange rate movements on wage and employment are systematically associated
with export openness, overall import penetration and ownership characteristics of
Chinese manufacturing industries. The magnitude of exchange rate movement effects
on employment is also systematically related to the profit margins of manufacturing
industries.

Appendix Trade openness, Ownership characteristics, Industry Specific Real
Exchange Rates and Foreign income
The overall average trade openness variable for 2001-2009 for industry 𝑖 (𝑇𝑇𝑖 ) is
defined as
𝑇𝑇𝑖 = 0.54

∑𝑡=2009
∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖
𝑡=2001 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖
+
0.46
𝑡=2009
𝑡=2009
∑𝑡=2001 𝑃𝑖𝑖
∑𝑡=2001(𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 )

where 0.54 is the average ratio of total export goods to total trade goods and 0.46 is
the average ratio of total import goods to total trade goods for China over the period of
2001 to 2009.
Average 2001 to 2009 export openness by industry is defined as
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖 =

∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖
∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝑃𝑖𝑖

Overall average 2001 to 2009 import penetration rate by industry is defined as
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 =

∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖

∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001(𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 )

Average shares of different ownership enterprises by industry over the period of 2001
to 2009 are defines as
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖 =

∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖
∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝑃𝑖𝑖

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖 =

∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖
∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝑃𝑖𝑖

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑖 =

∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖
∑𝑡=2009
𝑡=2001 𝑃𝑖𝑖

where SP𝑖𝑖 , 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 and 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 represent the total production of SOEs, private
enterprises and FIEs respectively.
Following Goldberg (2004), industry specific real exchange rates and foreign income
by industry are defined as
𝑖
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑘𝑗=1 𝜔𝑗𝑗
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗

𝑖
𝜔𝑗𝑗
= 0.54 ∗

𝑖
∑𝑡−1
𝑐=𝑡−2 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗

𝑖
∑𝑘𝑗=1 ∑𝑡−1
𝑐=𝑡−2 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗

𝑖
𝑌𝑖𝑖∗ = ∑𝑘𝑗=1 𝜔𝑗𝑗
𝑌𝑗𝑗

+ 0.46 ∗

𝑖
∑𝑡−1
𝑐=𝑡−2 𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗

𝑖
∑𝑘𝑗=1 ∑𝑡−1
𝑐=𝑡−2 𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗

𝑖
where 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗
represent the value exported by China to its trade partner 𝑗 in the
𝑖
specific sector 𝑖 at the period of 𝑐; and 𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗
represent the value imported by China
from its trade partner 𝑗 in the specific sector 𝑖 at the period of 𝑐.
