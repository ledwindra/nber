In the examples, a particular modification to the Taylor rule can reduce or even entirely eliminate the problems.  Under the modified policy, the central bank monitors the money growth rate and commits to abandoning the Taylor rule in favor of a money growth rule in case money growth passes outside a particular monitoring range.\n\n",
