    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper describes the empirical regularities relating fiscal policy variables, the level of development and the rate of growth.  We employ historical data, recent cross-section data, and newly constructed public investment series.  Our main findings are: (i) there is a strong association between the development level and the fiscal structure: poor countries rely heavily on international trade taxes, while income taxes are only important in developed economies; (ii) fiscal policy is influenced by the scale of the economy, measured by its population; (iii) investment in transport and communication is consistently correlated with growth while the effects of taxation are difficult to isolate empirically.\n\n",
