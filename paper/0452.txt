Exchange Rates, Prices.andMoney:
Lessons from the 1920's
ABSTRACT

The experience with flexible exchange rates during the 1920's has proven
to be extremely important in shaping out current thinking about the operation
of floating rates regime.

This paper summarizes the results of a comparative

empirical study of the~0peration of flexible exchange rates during the 1920's
under both the hyperinflationary conditions (based on the experience of Germany)
and under "normal".. conditions (based on the experience of Britain, the U.S.,
and France).

The three issues that are discussed are (i) the efficiency of the

foreign exchange market which is analyzed by examining the relationship between
spot and forward exchange rates; (ii) the relationship between exchange rates
and prices which is analyzed by examining aspects of the purchasing power parity
doctrine; and (iii) the determinants of exchange rates which is analyz:ed by
examining the relationship between exchange rates, money and expectations.

The experience with flexible exchange rates during the 1920's has proven to be
extremely important in shaping our current thinking about a variety of issues
including the choice among alternative exchange rate regimes, the role of speculation
in the market for foreign exchange, the purchasing power parity doctrine and the
determinants of equilibrium exchange rates.
Probably no event in monetary history has been studied more closely than the
German hyperinflation.

Economists have been attracted to study this episode since it

provides an environment that is close to a controlled experiment which is so rare
in the study of social sciences.

It also provides a convenient starting point for

the reexamination of ~heories in circumstances in which the predominant disturbance is
of a monetary origin.

However, interest in the experience with flexible exchange rates

during the 1920's is not confined only to the lessons from the German hyperinflation.
From the viewpoint of economic research, that experience provides also the opportunity
to conduct a comparative study of the operation of flexible exchange rates under "normal"
conditions.

Specifically, until the return to gold by Britain (in 1925) many countries

adopted a flexible exchange rate system.

This system was successful in insulating most

of the world from the direct consequences of the extraordinary German hyperinflation
of 1921-23.

Thus, during the same period in which Germany was experiencing the

. hyperinflation, much of the rest of the world was operating under practically "normal"
conditions.
This paper summarizes the results of an empirical study of the operation of
flexible exchange rates during the 1920's under both the hyperinflationary conditions
(based on the experience of Germany) and under
experience of Britain, the U.S. and France).

characteristics of the market for foreign exchange by examining the relationship between

I.

Characteristics of the Market for Foreign Exchange
This section describes some characteristics of the foreign exchange market by

examining the relationship between spot and forward exchange rates.

The hyperinflation

period is analysed using the Mark/Pound exchange rate during February 1921-August 1923,
and the "normal" period is analysed using the Franc/Pound, the Dollar/Pound and the
Franc/Dollar exchange rates (of which only two are independent) during the period
February 1921-May 1925.

The length of the hyperinflation period was determined by the

availability of data on the forward exchange rate, whereas the "normal" period was
terminated by the return of Britain to gold.

Data sources for the hyperinflation are

the same as in Frenkel (1977) and the sources for the "normal" period are the same as in
Frenkel (1978) and Frenkel and Kenneth W. Clements.

All data are monthly.

To examine the relationship between spot and forward rates, I first regress the
logarithm of the current spot exchange rate,

~n

St' on the logarithm of the one-month

forward exchange rate prevailing at the previous month,

~n

F

t-

l,as in equation (1).

If the forward exchange rate is an unbiased forecast of the future spot exchange
rate, the constant terms in equation (1) should not differ significantly from zero,l
and the slope coefficient should not differ significantly from unity.

Efficiency of

the market requires that the residuals from the estimated regression be serially
uncorrelated.

Table 1 contains the ordinary least squares estimates of equation (1).

As may be seen for the "normal" period the hypotheses that the constant terms do not
differ significantly from zero and that the slope coefficients do not differ significantly
from unity cannot be rejected (at the 95 percent confidence level).

The Durbin-Watson

statistics indicate the absence of first-order autocorrelated residuals; an examination
of higher order correlations (up to 12 lags) shows that no correlation of any order
is significant.

For the hyperinflation case the constant term is somewhat negative

while the slope coefficient is somewhat above unity (at the 95 percent confidence
level).

Most importantly, however, the residuals from the equations are serially

In all cases the inclusion of an additional lagged

value of the forward rate does not lower the standard error of the regressions and
its coefficient does not differ significantly from zero.

This finding is consistent

with the hypothesis that the forward rate prevailing at period t-l summarizes all
available information and thus the inclusion of data from period t-2 does not
improve the fit.
The efficiency of the market can also be analysed from a different angle.

If the forward premium on forward

exchange summarizes all available information concerning the future evolution of the
exchange rate, then given the value of the forward premium, the past history of the
rate of depreciation should not "help" the prediction, and the joint hypotheses that
a

l

and Si are zero should not be rejected.

Applying these tests (using 4, 5, and 6

lags) reveal that for the German hyperinflation the null-hypothesis can not be rejected
at the 95 percent confidence level (for further details see Frenkel, 1980b).

For the

"normal" period the results are similar but somewhat less strong: in some cases the
null-hypothesis is rejected (marginally) at the 95 percent confidence level but not
at the 99 percent.

the joint hypotheses

It is concluded therefore that the

forward premium on foreign exchange incorporates the relevant available information
contained in past exchange rate changes.

It should be noted that if we regard the

forward premium as a measure of the predicted change in the exchange rate, then this
prediction accounts for a very small fraction of the actual variations and thus
indicating that the bulk of exchange rate changes are due to "new information."
This fact seems to be an empirical regularity which is found in both the hyperinflation

4

period as well as in the "normal" period.

Further evidence from these and other

periods are provided by Michael Mussa, Frenkel (1980a), and Frenkel and Mussa.

test outlined by Jerry Hausman.

To examine this possibility I follow the specificatior.

The m-statistics reported in Table 1 indicate that in

all cases the use of the forward exchange rate as a proxy for expectations does not
introduce'a significant errors in variables bias.
The principal conclusions that may be drawn from the previous discussion are that
the behavior of the foreign exchange market during the "normal" period was consistent
with the general implications of the efficient market hypothesis and that the forward
exchange rate summarized the relevant available information concerning the future
evolution of the rate.

These results are somewhat less clear for the hyperinflation

period where it is seen (in Table 1) that the forward rate seems to have underpredicted
the future spot rate.

However, in view of the unprecedented acceleration of the rates

of inflation and depreciation, one could expect that, while individuals learn the new
structure, mistakes would be made and expectations would initially underpredict the
actual course of events.

With this perspective I interpret the overall behavior of

the foreign exchange market during the hyperinflation as being in accord with the
broad principles of an efficiently functioning market.
II.

Exchange Rates and Prices
The relationship between exchange rates and prices is summarized by the purchasing

power parity doctrine (PPP) which states that the equilibrium exchange rate between
domestic and foreign currencies equals the ratio between domestic and foreign prices.
The intellectual origins of the doctrine can be traced back to the writings of John
wheatley and David Richardo in the early part of the 19th century and its more recent

5

revival owes much to Gustav Cassel's writings mainly during the 1920's.

Some aspects

of the doctrinal controversies ,and interpretations of the doctrine are analysed in
Frenkel (1978).
In its general form the PPP relationship can be written as:

where St' P t and

P~

denote, respectively, the exchange rate, domestic and foreign

price indices (with an asterisk denoting quantities pertaining to the foreign country)
and where u

t

denotes an error term.

From the empirical viewpoint several :issues may be raised: (i) What price index
should be used in equation (3)? (ii) Are the coefficients of domestic and foreign prices
the same? (iii) Are the data consistent with the hypothesis that the coefficients of
domestic and foreign prices are both unity, i.e., are b

= b* = I?

These questions are examined below for both periods using alternative price indices.
To allow for a simultaneous determination of prices and exchange rates equation (3) was
estimated using a two-stage least squares estimation procedure.
reported in Table 2.

The estimates are

Also reported in the Table are the values of F-statistics

relevant for testing the hypothesis that b = b* = 1.
On the whole, for the "normal" period the results show that except for one case
(corresponding to the regression of the Dollar/Pound exchange rate on the ratio of the
material price indices) the data are consistent with the joint restrictions implied by
the homogeneity postulate.

For example, the elasticity of the Franc/Dollar exchange

rate with respect to the wholesale price ratio is 1.091 and the joint hypothesis that
b

= b* = 1 is not rejected since the value of the F-statistic is 2.32 while the critical'

value (at

th~

95 percent confidence level) is 3.19.

For further evidence see Frenkel

(1978) and Paul Krugman.
In applying equation (3) to the hyperinflation period it was assumed that the
variations in p/p* were completely dominated by variations in German prices so that
the foreign price could be viewed as being fixed.

As is seen in Table 2, the PPP

doctrine seems to be satisfied for the wholesale price index where the elasticity of
the exchange rate with respect to that price is 1.026.

It holds less well for the

cost of living index which includes prices of many non-traded goods.

Nonetheless,

even for the cost of living index the elasticity is not too far from unity.
In assessing these results it is important to recall that the estimates are based
on monthly data, and that short-run deviations from PPP may reflect the fact that not
all markets adjust at the same speed.

It is also important to recognize that the PPP

doctrine describes an equilibrium relationship between two endogenous variables.

As

such, it should be viewed as a short-cut rather than a substitute for a more complete
model of the determination of prices and exchange rates.

The main usefulness of the

doctrine is in providing a guide as to the general trend of exchange rates rather than
the day-to-day fluctuations.

The main lesson for policy that is provided by the

evidence in Table 2 is that the exchange rate and the price level cannot be divorced
from each other and, as a first approximation, policies which affect the trend of
domestic (relative to foreign)prices, also affect the exchange rate in the same manner.
III.

Exchange Rates, Money and Expectations
This section analyses the determinants of exchange rates during the 1920's from

the perspective of the monetary (or the asset market) approach to the exchange rate.
Being a relative price of two assets (moneys), the equilibrium exchange rate is
attained when the existing stocks of the two moneys are willingly held.

Therefore,

it is convenient (though not necessary) to analyse the determinants of the exchange
rate in terms of the supply and the demand for these moneys.

2

The central insight

obtained from this approach is the recognition that expectations concerning the future
exchange rates are among the prime determinants of current exchange rates.

3

A simple exchange rate equation which incorporates these considerations is
specified in equation (4)
(4)

S = f(M, M*, y, y*, n)

7

where M and M* denote domestic and foreign money supplies, y and y* denote domestic
and foreign incomes,

TI

denotes the forward premium on foreign exchange (which is

assumed to measure the expected depreciation of the currency) and where S denotes the
exchange rate, i.e., the price of foreign exchange in terms of domestic currency.
While this equation can be derived from a specific monetary model (which allows for
real and monetary factors) like in Frenkel (1976) and John Bilson, a similar set of
variables would also appear in the reduced form of a variety of alternative models
(see Rudiger Dornbusch).

The predictions are that, ceteris paribus, (i) a rise in the

supply of domestic money will raise S (i.e., depreciate the home currency) while a
rise in the supply of foreign money will lower S.

The homogeneity postulate requires

that the elasticity of S with respect to M and M* be unity and minus unity, respectively;
(ii) a rise in domestic income due, for example, to a rise in productivity which
raises the relative demand for domestic money, will appreciate the currency (lower S),
while a rise in foreign income (which raises the relative demand for foreign money) will
depreciate the currency,4 and (iii) a rise in the forward premium on foreign exchange will
lower the relative demand for domestic money and will depreciate the currency (raise S).
Estimates of equation (4) are reported in Table 3.
it was assumed that variations in the ratio

various parameters.

To obtain more precise estimates the sample information was

supplemented by prior information about the elasticities with respect to the money
supplies, and the forward premium (which was based on the estimates for the
hyperinflation period) according to the Theil-Goldberger mixed estimation procedure.
This procedure was adopted for the Franc/Pound and the Franc/Dollar exchange rates
2
after varifying (according to a X test) that the sample and the prior information

were compatible with each other; the Dollar/Pound exchange rate failed the X test.

As is evident from Table 3, the results are consistent with the predictions.

For

both exchange rates the elasticity with respect to domestic and foreign money supplies
are unity and minus unity, respectively, and the (semi) elasticities with respect to
the forward premium are positive.

The income elasticities are not significant (at

the 95 percent confidence level).

In the only case where the income elasticity comes

close to being significant (foreign income in the Franc/Pound exchange rate) it has
the correct positive sign.

While the results for the "normal" period seem

to be

consistent with the theoretical predictions, the fact that the sample provides very
little information suggests that the data would also be compatible with different
values of the prior information and that the test is not sufficiently powerful to
discriminate among alternative approaches.
IV.

Concluding Remarks
The experience of the 1920's provides the opportunity to conduct a comparative

study of the behavior of a flexible exchange rates system under "normal" conditions
as well as under highly inflationary conditions.

The three issues examined in this

paper are, (i) the relationship between spot and forward exchange rates, (ii) the
relationship between exchange rates and prices, and (iii) the relationship between
exchange rates, money and expectations.
In a recent paper dealing with inflation and unemployment Robert J. Gordon
analysed the reactions of a hypothetical modern-day Rip Van Winkle who had become
well acquainted with the earlier literature but who only recently awoke from a

9

decade-long nap.

It is interesting to examine a related experiment: suppose

that Rip who was well acquainted with the data reported in this paper , went to
sleep in 1925 to be awoken in the 1970's.

This question is of special interest since world capital

markets have become much more integrated, the role of "real" shocks in the 1970's
have become much more important, views about the role of government in the conduct
of macroeconomic policies have changed, the roles of tariff and non-tariff barriers
to trade as well as the degree of exchange rate management have been altered and
finally, the International Monetary Fund has been created.

The various characteristics of the

relationship between spot and forward exchange rates which were discussed in Section
I seem to be the most robust.

It seems to be stable between the "normal" and the

hyperinflation periods of the 1920's and the evidence from the 1970's suggests that
it is also stable over time.

The major difference relates to the relationship between

exchange rates and prices: while the PPP doctrine held up reasonably well during
the 1920's, the evidence from the 1970's indicates large departures from PPP.
departures have not yet been fully explained.

Finally, the relationship between

exchange rates, money and the forward premium was shown to be very significant during
the hyperinflation but less so during tl1Ie "normal" period.

A similar pattern seems

to reemerge in the 1970's where analogous exchange rate equations are more successful
in circumstances with high inflation than in circumstances with low

inflation~

This emphasis on the stock demand and supply of moneys was also adopted by John
Meynard Keynes in explaining the value of the French Franc:"What, then, has
determined and will determine the value of the Franc? First, the quantity, present
and prospective, of francs in circulation.

Second, the amount of purchasing power

which it suits the public to hold in this shape" (introduction to French edition,
1924, xviii).

The renewed emphasis on stock considerations should not be interpreted

to imply that flow relationships are not important; the equilibrium is attained
by the interaction of flow and stock equilibrium conditions.
