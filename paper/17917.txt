Game Over: Simulating Unsustainable Fiscal Policy

ABSTRACT
Fiscal sustainability is one of the most pressing policy issues of our time. Yet it remains difficult to
quantify. Official debt is plagued with a number of measurement difficulties since its measurement
reflects the choice of words, not policies. And forming the fiscal gap–the imbalance in the government's
intertemporal budget–requires strong discount rate assumptions. An alternative approach, taken here,
is specifying a stochastic general equilibrium model and determining via simulation how long it takes
for the economy to reach game over–the point where current policy can no longer be maintained. Our
simulations, based on an OLG model calibrated to the U.S. economy, produce an average duration
to game over of roughly one century, with a 35 percent chance of reaching the fiscal limit in roughly
30 years. The prospect of man-made economic collapse produces large equity premia, like those observed
in the data. Our simulations show that both the fiscal gap and the equity premium rise as the economy
gets closer to hitting its fiscal limit, suggesting that the fiscal gap and the equity premium may be good
indicators of unsustainable policy.

Introduction

Most developed countries appear to be running unsustainable fiscal policies. In the
U.S., federal liabilities (official debt plus the present value of projected non-interest
expenditures) exceed federal assets (the present value of projected taxes) by $211
trillion or 14 times GDP. Closing this fiscal gap requires an immediate and permanent
64 percent hike in all federal taxes.1 Unlike official debt, the fiscal gap is a label-free
and, thus, meaningful measure of fiscal sustainability.2 But measuring the fiscal gap
raises questions of how to properly discount risky future government purchases and
the remaining lifetime net taxes of current and future generations—their generational
accounts.
Our approach to assessing sustainability is to simulate a stochastic general equilibrium model and see how long it takes for unsustainable policy to produce game
over—the point where the policies can no longer be maintained. Our framework is
intentionally simple – a two-period OLG model with first-period labor supply and an
aggregate productivity shock. The government redistributes a fixed amount Ht each
period from the young to the old. If times become sufficiently bad and the economy
reaches game over (i.e., Ht exceeds the earnings of the young), we either let the government take all of the earnings of the young and give them to the old and, thereby,
terminate the economy or start redistributing a fixed proportion of earnings from the
young to the old.
Our simulations, calibrated to the U.S. economy, produce an average duration to
game over of about one century, with a 35 percent chance of reaching the fiscal limit
in about 30 years. We also calculate our model’s fiscal gap and equity premium. Our
model’s fiscal gaps are generally small and quite sensitive to the choice of discount
rate. But, for any choice of discount factors, the fiscal gaps are much larger when
the economy is closer to game over, suggesting that this measure can provide early
warning of unsustainable policy.

When post game-over policy terminates the economy, initial period equity premia
are about 6 percent—high enough to explain the equity premium puzzle. When gameover is followed by proportional redistribution, equity premiums are initially about 2
percent, but rise dramatically as the economy approaches game over.
When our economy reaches game over, the government is forced to default on its
promised payment to the contemporaneous elderly. Thus, this paper contributes to
both the literatures on sovereign default3 and fiscally stressed economies.4
Our model has no money, so it doesn’t include the monetary and fiscal interactions described in Sargent and Wallace (1981) and highlighted in the recent fiscal
limits research.5 It does include sticky fiscal policy, examined in Alesina and Drazen
(1991)as well as Auerbach and Hassett (1992, 2001, 2002, 2007) and Hassett and
Metcalf (1999), and regime switching, surveyed in Hamilton (2008).
Section 2 presents the case that game over is followed by policy that kills the
economy. Section 3 looks at the switch to policy with either permanently high or
moderate intergenerational redistribution. Section 4 concludes.

Model with Shut Down

Consider a model with overlapping generations of 2-period-lived agents in which the
government redistributes a fixed amount H̄ ≥ 0 from the young to the old each period
in which the transfer is feasible. When the transfer is not feasible, the government
redistributes all of the available earnings of the young. In so doing, it leaves the
economy with no capital in the subsequent period and makes game over economically
terminal.

2.1

Household problem

A unit measure of identical agents is born each period. They supply labor only when
when young and do so inelastically.
l1,t = ¯l = 1 ∀t
where l1,t is labor supplied by age-1 workers at time t.
Young agents at time t have no wealth and allocate the earnings not extracted by
the government between consumption ci,t and saving ki+1,t+1 to maximize expected
utility. Their problem is
max

c1,t ,k2,t+1 ,c2,t+1

u(c1,t ) + βEt [u(c2,t+1 )]

where c1,t + k2,t+1 ≤ wt − Ht
and c2,t+1 ≤ (1 + rt+1 − δ)k2,t+1 + Ht+1
and c1,t , c2,t+1 , k2,t+1 ≥ 0
and where u(ci,t ) =

(ci,t )1−γ − 1
1−γ

Consumption in the second period of life satisfies
c2,t+1 = (1 + rt+1 − δ)k2,t+1 + Ht+1

(1)

The non-negativity constraint on consumption never binds because each term on the
right-hand-side of (1) is weakly positive. Consumption and saving when young, c1,t
and k2,t+1 , are jointly determined by the first-period budget constraint and the Euler
equation.

(3)

From the right-hand-side of (2), the non-negativity constraints on c1,t and k2,t+1 bind
3

when wt ≤ H̄. In these cases the government is only able to collect Ht = wt . In so
doing, it forces the consumption and saving of the young to zero and terminates the
economy.

Firms collectively hire labor Lt , at real wage wt , and rent capital Kt , at real rental

where At = ezt is distributed log normally, and zt follows an AR(1) process.
zt = ρzt−1 + (1 − ρ)µ + εt

Solution and calibration

A competitive equilibrium for a given H̄ is defined as follows.

Definition 1 (Competitive equilibrium). A competitive equilibrium with economic shut down when wt < H̄ is defined as consumption c1,t and c2,t and savings
k2,t+1 allocations and a real wage wt and real net interest rate rt each period such
that:
i. households optimize according to (1), (2) and (3),
ii. firms optimize according to (6) and (7),
iii. markets clear according to (8), (9), and (10).

To solve the model, we rewrite (2) as
k2,t+1 = wt − Ht − c1,t

(11)

and use this and the model’s other equations to write the Euler equation as

(13)

Equations (12) and (13) determine c1,t when wt > H̄. Otherwise, Ht = wt , leaving
the young at t with zero consumption and saving (c1,t = k2,t+1 = 0).
Given our calibration described in Table 1, which treats one period as 30 years,
we solve the above two equations obtaining functions for c1,t , c2,t , k2,t+1 , Yt , wt , and
rt for any state (k2,t , zt ).6

Simulation

To explore our model, we ran 3,000 simulations for each of nine combinations of the
state variables and H̄. For each of these simulations, we followed the economy through
shut down. The nine combinations includes three values of H̄ = {0.05, 0.11, 0.17} and
for three different values of k2,0 = {0.11, 0.14, 0, 17}.7 In each simulation we set the
initial value of z at its median value µ. Recall that k2,0 references the capital held by
the old (generation 2) at time zero. Also note that median values refer to the medians
taken across all simulations for all periods in which the economy is still functioning.
Table 2 shows the median wage wmed , the median capital stock kmed , and the size
of H̄ and k2,0 relative to the median wage wmed and the median capital stock kmed ,
respectively, for each of the nine combinations of H̄ and k2,0 .
Table 3 provides four statistics on time to economic shutdown, i.e., wt ≤ H̄. The
middle row of Table 3 corresponding to H̄ = 0.11 shows that this model economy has
a greater than 50 percent chance of shutting down in 60 years (2 periods) under a
fiscal transfer system calibrated to be close to that of the United States. Table 3 also
indicates what one would expect – that the probability of a near-term shutdown is
very sensitive to the size of H̄ given the size of the economy’s time-zero capital stock
7

The three values for each roughly correspond to low, middle and high values. That is, H̄ = 0.11
is the value that is roughly equal to 32 percent of the median wage, and k2,0 = 0.14 is roughly equal
to the median capital stock across simulations.

Fiscal gap and equity premium

Because actual receipts extracted from young workers are not always equal to the
promised payment Ht ≤ H̄, we define the fiscal gap as the difference between the
present value of all promised payments to current and future older generations and
7

the present value of current receipts from current workers plus all future receipts
obtained, on average in each future period, from future workers. We express this
difference as a percent of the present value of all current and future output realized,
on average.
fiscal gapt = xt ≡

N P V (H̄) − N P V (Ht )
N P V (Yt )

(14)

This measure does not suffer from the economics labeling problem.
Define the discount factor in s periods from the current period as dt+s , and write
the net present values in the measure of the fiscal gap from (14) in terms of the
discount factors and expected streams of transfers and income.

(15)

We present four measures of the fiscal gap using four sequences of discount factors
dt+s —two from our model and two from the literature. The first measure of the
fiscal gap (fgap1) uses the prices of sure-return bonds that mature s periods from
the current period t as the discount factors. Define pt,j as the price of an asset Bt,j
with a sure-return payment of one unit j periods in the future. If these assets can be
bought and sold each period, then a household could purchase an asset that pays off
after the household is dead and sell it before they die. Because each of these assets
must be held in zero net supply, they do not change the equilibrium policy functions
described in Section 2.4. The equations characterizing the prices pt,j for all t and j
are:8

With the starting value of the sure-return price pt,0 pinned down, the prices of the
assets that mature in future periods can be calculated recursively using equation (16).

our discount factors—and their corresponding net discount rates shown on an annual

The first column in each cell is the price of the sure-return bond pt,t+s at different maturities s as
characterized by equation (16). The second column in each cell is the net interest rate rt,t+s APR
implied by the sure-return rate and given in annual percentage rate terms according to equation (17).
Full descriptions of the term structure of prices and interest rates for all calibrations and for up to
s = 12 is provided in the Technical Appendix.

The second fiscal gap measure (fgap 2) employs a constant discount rate, namely

The return or yield of a sure-return bond should increase with its maturity in an economy that
never shuts down. However, the increasing probability of the economy shutting down in each future
period counteracts the increasing value of the sure return in the future. This is why the interest
rates in the second column of each cell in Table 4 seem to go toward an asymptote in the limit.

the current-period risky return on capital Rt . For example, the risky return on capital
in period t is Rt = 1.4971 in the middle cell in which H̄ = 0.11 and k2,0 = 0.14. So
the discount factors are dt+s = (1.4971)−s . Our third fiscal gap measure (fgap 3)
uses a constant discount rate taken from International Monetary Fund (2009, Table
6.4). This study uses an annual discount factor of the growth rate in real GDP plus 1
percent to calculate the net present value of aging-related expeditures. This averages
out across G-20 countries to be a discount rate of around 4 percent and for the U.S.
is about 3.8 percent (Rt ≈ 3.1). So the discount rates for fgap3 are dt+s = (3.05)−s .
For the last measure of the fiscal gap (fgap4), we use the constant discount rate from
Gohkhale and Smetters (2007) who use an annual discount rate of 3.65 percent for
their discount factors in their NPV calculation. This is equivalent to a 30-year gross
discount rate of Rt ≈ 2.9. So the discount rates for fgap4 are dt+s = (2.93)−s . The
expectations for Ht and Yt are simply the average values from the 3,000 simulations
described in Section 2.5.
Table 5 presents fiscal gaps for the nine different combinations of promised transfers H̄ and initial capital stock k2,0 as a percent of the net present value of output.
By way of comparison, we note that the U.S. fiscal gap is currently 12 percent of the
present value of projected GDP. The figures in table 5 are generally much smaller.
Importantly, though, given the initial capital stock, higher values of H̄ are associated
not just with much quicker time to shut down, but also substantially larger fiscal gaps
regardless of the discount rates used.
Next we use the difference in the expected risky return on capital E[Rt+1 ] and
the riskless return on the one-period safe bond Rt,t+1 to calculate an equity premium. A large literature attempts to explain why the observed equity premium is
so large.10 Most recently, Barro (2009) has shown that incorporating rare disasters
into an economic model produces realistic risk premia and risk free rates. Our model
features disaster in the form of economic shutdown, and it too (see Table 6) model
produces realistic equity premia, ranging from 4.7 percent to as 7.3 percent, for a

Fiscal gap 1 uses the gross sure return rates Rt,t+s from Table 4 as the discount
rates for NPV calculation. Fiscal gap 2 uses the current period gross return on
capital Rt from the model as the constant discount rate. Fiscal gap 3 uses the
International Monetary Fund (2009) method of an annual discount rate equal
to 1 plus the average percent change in GDP plus 0.01 (≈ 2.05). And fiscal gap
4 uses the Gohkhale and Smetters (2007) method of an annual discount rate
equal to 1 plus 0.0365 (≈ 1.93).

moderate-sized coefficient of relative risk aversion of γ = 2.
Table 6 present Sharpe ratios as well as all of the components of the equity premium. For the expected risky return E[Rt+1 ], the one-period sure return Rt,t+1 , and
the equity premium (the difference between the two), we report results for both one
period from the model (30 years) as well as the annualized (one-year) version. Our
Sharpe ratios between 0.32 and 0.33 are in line with common estimates from the data.
Because the equity premium and the Sharpe ratio fluctuate from period-to-period,
we report in Table 7 the average equity premium and Sharpe ratio across simulations
in the period immediately before the economic shutdown.
Table 8 compares three measures of the fiscal gap in the initial period to the fiscal
gap in the period immediately before shutdown.11 As with the equity premium and
Sharpe ratio, the fiscal gap increases on average in the period immediately before
shutdown relative to the initial period. In our baseline case of H̄ = 0.11 and k2,0 =
0.14, the fiscal gap nearly doubles in the period before shutdown. Tables 7 and 8
provide evidence that both the fiscal gap and the equity premium are good leading
indicators of how close an economy is to its fiscal limit.
11

We exclude the calculation of measure of the fiscal gap that uses the current period marginal
product of capital as the discount rate (fgap2) because the discount rate is often negative in the
period immediately before shutdown. We exclude fgap3 because it is similar to fgap4.

The gross risky one-period return on capital is Rt+1 = 1 + rt+1 − δ. The annualized gross risky one-period
return is (Rt+1 )1/30 . The expected value and standard deviation of the gross risky one-period return Rt+1 are
calculated as the average and standard deviation, respectively, across simulations. The annual equity premium
is the expected value of the annualized risky return in the next period minus the annualized return on the
one-period riskless bond.

“percent smaller” rows tell how many of the simulated ending values of the equity premium and Sharpe
ratio were bigger than or less than, respectively, their initial period values. These percentages do not sum
to one because the equity premium and Sharpe ratio do not change in the cases in which the economy
shuts down in the second period.

Model with Regime Change

We now assume that when the government defaults on its promised transfer wt ≤ H̄,
the regime switches permanently to one in which the transfer is simply τ percent of
the wage each period Ht = τ wt . We solve the model for τ = 0.8 and τ = 0.3.

3.1

Regime change to 80-percent wage tax

Figure 1 illustrates the rule for the transfer Ht under regime 1 in which the transfer
is H̄ unless wages wt are less than H̄ and under regime 2 in which the transfer is
permanently switched to the proportional transfer system Ht = 0.8wt .
3.1.1

Household problem, firm problem, and market clearing

The characterization of the household problem remains the same as in equations (1),
(2), and (3) from Section 2.1. The only difference is in the definition of Ht in those
equations. With the new regime switching assumption, the transfer each period from
14

the young to the old Ht is defined as follows.


H̄


0.8wt

(18)

The change is reflected in the expectations of the young of consumption when old
c2,t+1 in the savings decision (3).
The firm’s problem and the characterization of output, aggregate productivity
shock, and optimal net real return on capital and real wage are the same as equations
(4) through (7) in Section 2.2. The market clearing conditions that must hold in each
period are the same as (8), (9), and (10) from Section 2.3
3.1.2

Solution and calibration

The competitive equilibrium with a transfer program regime switch is characterized
in the same way as Definition 1 with economic shut down except that the transfer
each period is characterized by equation (18). For the current young, this regime
switch decreases the expected value of next period’s transfer Ht+1 —0.8wt + 1 instead
of wt + 1. Thus, the current period young will save more and bring more savings
k2,t+1 into old age than did the young in Section 2. Once the regime has permanently

(21)

and in which we have substituted in the expressions for rt and wt from (6) and (7),
respectively, and Ht = 0.8wt .
We calibrate parameters as in Table 1 for the economic shut down model with the
exception of H̄. We again calibrate H̄ to be 32 percent of the median wage. However,
we calculate the median wage from the time periods in the simulations before the
regime switches (regime 1). Because the economy never shuts down, it is less risky
in the long run. But the economy is actually more risky to the current period young
in that the expected value of their transfer in the next period is decreased by the
potential regime switch. Higher precautionary saving induces a higher median wage
and a higher promised transfer H̄ = 0.09 in order to equal 32 percent of the regime
1 median wage.
3.1.3

Simulation

We again simulate the regime switching model 3,000 times with various combinations
of values for the promised transfer H̄ ∈ {0.09, 0.11} and the initial capital stock
k2,0 ∈ {0.0875, 0.14}. As shown in Table 9, our calibrated values of H̄ = 0.09 and
k2,0 = 0.0875 correspond to 32 percent of the median real wage in regime 1 and the
median capital stock in regime 1, respectively. In each simulation we again use an
initial value of the productivity shock of its median value z0 = µ.
The upper left cell of Table 9 is analogous to the middle cell of Table 2 in that H̄

is calibrated to be 32 percent of the regime 1 real wage and k2,0 to equal the regime
1 median capital stock. However, the lower right cell of Table 9 has the same H̄ and
k2,0 as the middle cell of Table 2. Notice that the median capital stock is higher in the
regime switching economy (kmed = 0.1.5567 for H̄ = 0.11 and k2,0 = 0.14 in regime
switching economy as compared to kmed = 0.1.0311 in the shutdown economy with
the same H̄ and k2,0 ). This is because young households have an increased risk in the
second period of life under the possibility of a regime switch because their transfer
will be lower in the case of a default on H̄.
Table 10 presents time to game over for this policy. Notice that the distribution
of time until regime switch across simulations from the upper left cell of Table 10
is very similar to the middle cell in Table 3 from the shut down economy. Higher
precautionary savings extends the time until a regime switch, but increased promised
transfers reduce that time.
3.1.4

Fiscal gap and equity premium

For the model with regime switching to an 80-percent wage tax, we define the fiscal
gap in the same way as in equation (14) from Section 2.6. The discount factors used to
calculate the net present values in the fiscal gap measures from the regime switching
model are calculated in the same way as described in Section 2.6. Table 11 shows the
calculated sure-return prices and their corresponding annualized discount rates for
this regime switching economy. Each cell represents the computed prices and interest

rates that correspond to a particular promised transfer value H̄ and initial capital
stock k2,0 .
Table 12 shows our four measures of the fiscal gap as a percent of the net present
value of GDP for each of our four combinations of H̄ and k2,0 . Some of the fiscal gap
measures are negative. This occurs because some of the discount factors decay more
slowly than others (fgap 1 is the slowest) and because expected receipts are higher
after the regime switch. Indeed, they can even end up higher than than H̄. Even
though the impulse response of wt decays to a lower level after the regime switch,
the expected Ht can be high because of the high variance in productivity shocks. A
median value would be lower. We therefore can get negative fiscal gap measures, even
though H̄ is big enough to trigger a regime switch in relatively few periods. Table 12
computes fiscal gaps as a percent of the present value of output as in equation (14)
for the four combinations of values for the promised transfer H̄ and the initial capital
stock k2,0 .
Note also in Table 12 that the fiscal gap measure fgap1 becomes even more negative
as H̄ increases. This is caused by the higher H̄ shortening the periods until the regime
switch or higher Ht values. In other words, the positive effect on the fiscal gap from

4 to form the discount factors used in its present value calculations. Fiscal gap 2 uses the current period gross return
on capital Rt from the model as the constant discount rate.
Fiscal gap 3 uses the International Monetary Fund (2009)
method of an annual discount rate equal to 1 plus the average percent change in GDP plus 0.01 (≈ 2.05). And fiscal
gap 4 follows Gohkhale and Smetters (2007) in forming the
discount factors using an annual discount rate equal to 1
plus 0.0365 (≈ 1.93).

a higher H̄ in the pre-switch periods is dominated by the negative effect on the fiscal
gap from more periods of high regime 2 Ht . For the other measures of the fiscal gap,
the second effect dominates so the fiscal gap increases with the size of the promised
transfer H̄.
Finally, we caclulate the equity premium and Sharpe ratio for this regime-switching
model using the difference in the expected risky return on capital one period from
now E[Rt+1 ] and the riskless return on the sure-return bond maturing one period
from now Rt,t+1 . In reference to the Barro (2009) result, our model with regime
switching delivers equity premia that are significantly lower than the riskier model
with shut down from Section 2.6 and do not match as closely observed equity premia
and Sharpe ratios. As shown in Table 13, our regime switching model produces equity
premia around 2 percent and Sharpe ratios around 0.28.
The interesting equity premium story in the model with the 80-percent regime
switch is what happens to the equity premium as the economy approaches game one
with respect to its initial policy. Table 14 reports the average equity premium and
Sharpe ratio across simulations in the period immediately before the regime switch as

The gross risky one-period return on capital is Rt+1 = 1 + rt+1 − δ. The annualized gross risky one-period return is (Rt+1 )1/30 . The expected value and standard
deviation of the gross risky one-period return Rt+1 are calculated as the average
and standard deviation, respectively, across simulations. The annual equity premium
is the expected value of the annualized risky return in the next period minus the
annualized return on the one-period riskless bond.

The “period 1” row represents the equity premium and Sharpe ratio in the initial
period for each specification. The “before shutdown” row represents the average
equity premium and Sharpe ratio across simulations in the period immediately
before shutdown for each specification. The “percent bigger” and “percent smaller”

Sharpe ratio were bigger than or less than, respectively, their initial period values.
These percentages do not sum to one because the equity premium and Sharpe ratio
do not change in the cases in which the economy shuts down in the second period.

Regime change to 30-percent wage tax

In this section, we show the effects of a less severe proportional wage tax of 30 percent
Ht = 0.3wt in the case of a regime switch.
3.2.1

Simulation

As shown in Table 15, our calibrated values of H̄ = 0.09 and k2,0 = 0.0875 again
correspond to about 32 percent of the median real wage in regime 1 and close to
the median capital stock in regime 1, respectively. Note that none of these regime 1
values change much from Table 9 even though regime 2 entails switching to a very
different policy when current policy fails. In each simulation we use an initial value
of the productivity shock of its median value z0 = µ.

wmed is the median wage and kmed is the median capital stock across
all 3,000 simulations before the regime switch (in regime 1).

The upper left cell of Table 15 is analogous to the middle cell of Table 2 in that H̄
is calibrated to be 32 percent of the regime 1 real wage and k2,0 to equal the regime 1
median capital stock. However, the lower right cell of Table 15 has the same H̄ and
k2,0 as the middle cell of Table 2. Notice that the median capital stock is higher in
the regime-switching economy (kmed = 0.1.5970 for H̄ = 0.11 and k2,0 = 0.14 in the
regime-switching economy as compared to kmed = 0.1.0311 in the shutdown economy
with the same H̄ and k2,0 ). This is because young households have an increased risk
in the second period of life under the possibility of a regime switch because their
transfer will be lower in the case of a default on H̄.
Table 16 summarizes our findings on time to regime switch; i.e., wt ≤ H̄. Notice
that the distributions of time until regime switch across simulations in all the cells
of Table 16 are very similar to the distributions in Table 10 where the government
takes 80 percent of wages when it can no longer take H̄. Higher precautionary savings
extends the time until a regime switch, but increased promised transfers reduce that
time.
3.2.2

Fiscal gap and equity premium

Table 17 shows the calculated sure-return prices and their corresponding annualized
discount rates for this regime switching economy. Each cell represents the computed
prices and interest rates that correspond to a particular promised transfer value H̄
and initial capital stock k2,0 .

Table 18 shows our four measures of the fiscal gap as a percent of the net present
value of GDP for each of our four combinations of H̄ and k2,0 . Similar to the 80percent tax regime switch model, all the measures for the first measure of the fiscal
gap (fgap1) are negative. These negative fiscal gaps—and relatively low measures of
the fiscal gap for the other measures—occur because the expected Ht after the regime
swith is significantly higher than H̄. But in all cases, increased H̄ increases the fiscal
gap.

Fiscal gap 1 uses the gross sure return rates Rt,t+s from
Table 4 as the discount rates for NPV calculation. Fiscal
gap 2 uses the current period gross return on capital Rt
from the model as the constant discount rate. Fiscal gap
3 uses the International Monetary Fund (2009) method of
an annual discount rate equal to 1 plus the average percent
change in GDP plus 0.01 (≈ 2.05). And fiscal gap 4 uses
the Gohkhale and Smetters (2007) method of an annual discount rate equal to 1 plus 0.0365 (≈ 1.93).

Finally, we calculate the equity premium and Sharpe ratio for this regime switching
model. The equity premium results in Table 19 differ little from those in Table 13.
This means that the form of the regime change has little effect on the initial period
equity premium. The equity premia here around 2 percent with Sharpe ratios around
0.28.
Table 20 reports the average equity premium and Sharpe ratio across simulations
in the period immediately before the regime switch as compared to their respective
values in the first period. Once again, the average equity premium and Sharpe ratio increase significantly from the initial period to the period right before the regime switch
in every case. In both the 80-percent and 30-percent wage-redistribution models, the

Conclusion

Our model is as simple as it gets for examining fiscal sustainability. Yet its findings
suggest that maintaining unsustainable policies of the kind currently being conducted
in the U.S. and other developed nations raises an important set of challenges for
long-term economic performance. Younger generations have only 100 percent of their
earnings to surrender to older generations. As the government enforces ever greater
redistribution, the economy saves and invests less and wages either fall or grow at
slower rates than would otherwise be true. In the U.S., generational policy appears
responsible for reducing the rate of national saving from roughly 15 percent in the
early 1950s to close to zero percent today. The rate of net domestic investment has
plunged as well. And for most American workers real wage growth has become a
distant memory.
27

Clearly, multi-period models using the sparse grid techniques developed by Krueger
and Kubler (2006) are needed to provide more realistic Monte Carlo simulations of
actual or near economic death. Whether such models can be developed in time and
in sufficient detail to influence developed-country policymakers to alter their current
policies remains to be seen.

Description of calibration

This section details how we arrived at the calibrated parameter values listed in Table
1. The 30-year discount factor β is set to match the annual discount factor common
in the RBC literature of 0.96.
β = (0.96)30
We set the coefficient of relative risk aversion at a midrange value of γ = 2. This value
lies in the midrange of values that have been used in the literature.12 The capital
share of income parameter is set to match the U.S. average α = 0.35, and the 30-year
depreciation rate δ is set to match an annual depreciation rate of 5 percent.
δ = 1 − (1 − 0.05)30
The equilibrium production process in our 2-period model is the following,
Yt = ezt Ktα

∀t

where labor is supplied inelastically and zt is the aggregate total factor productivity
shock. We assume the shock zt is an AR(1) process with normally distributed errors.
zt = ρzt−1 + (1 − ρ)µ + εt
where ρ ∈ [0, 1), µ ≥ 0,

and εt ∼ N (0, σ 2 )

(5)

This implies that the shock process ezt is lognormally distributed LN (0, σ 2 ). The
RBC literature calibrates the parameters on the shock process (5) to ρ = 0.95 and
σ = 0.4946 for annual data.
For data in which one period is 30 years, we have to recalculate the analogous ρ̃
and σ̃.
zt+1 = ρzt + (1 − ρ)µ + εt+1
zt+2 = ρzt+1 + (1 − ρ)µ + εt+2
= ρ2 zt + ρ(1 − ρ)µ + ρεt+1 + (1 − ρ)µ + εt+2
zt+3 = ρzt+2 + (1 − ρ)µ + εt+3
= ρ3 zt + ρ2 (1 − ρ)µ + ρ2 εt+1 + ρ(1 − ρ)µ + ρεt+2 + (1 − ρ)µ + εt+3

Estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion γ mostly lie between 1 and 10. See Mankiw
and Zeldes (1991), Blake (1996), Campbell (1996), Kocherlakota (1996), Brav, Constantinides, and
Geczy (2002), and Mehra and Prescott (1985).

be:

Then the persistence parameters in our
one-period-equals-thirty-years model should

be ρ̃ = ρ = 0.2146. Define ε̃t+30 ≡ s=1 ρ30−s εt+s as the summation term on the
right-hand-side of (A.1.1). Then ε̃t+30 is distributed:
# !

ε̃t+30 ∼ N 0,

Using this formula, the annual persistence parameter ρ = 0.95, and the annual standard deviation parameter σ = 0.4946, the implied thirty-year standard deviation is
σ̃ = 1.5471. So our shock process should be,
zt = ρ̃zt−1 + (1 − ρ)µ̃ + ε̃t

∀t where ε̃ ∼ N (0, σ̃ 2 )

where ρ̃ = 0.2146 and σ̃ = 1.5471. We calibrate µ, and therefore µ̃, so that the
median wage is 50,000.
Lastly, we set the size of the promised transfer H̄ to be 32 percent of the median
real wage. This level of transfers is meant to approximately match the average per
capita real transfers in the United States to the average real wage in recent years. We
get the median real wage by simulating a time series of the economy until it hits the
shut down point, and we do this for 3,000 simulated time series. We take the median
wage from those simulations. In order to reduce the effect of the initial values on
the median, we take the simulation that lasted the longest number of periods before
shutting down and remove the first 10 percent of the longest simulation’s periods
from each simulation for the calculation of the median.
