    "abstract": "\n\nIt has long been believed that international competition forces domestic firms to behave more competitively. I term this the imports-as--market-discipline hypothesis. I construct a simple static oligopoly model and estimate the model using panel data from Turkish manufacturing firms. The data span the course of a dramatic trade liberalization. Looking for changes in price-marginal cost markups as trade policy shifts, I test the imports-as-market discipline hypothesis. In all five industries to which the hypothesis is relevant, markups change in the direction predicted by the theory. These changes are statistically significant in all but one of the five industries.\n\n",
