In this paper, we generalize some of the results and present the structure of the model in moredetail. Using a four-country, two-tier macroeconomic model, it is shown that the pseudo-exchange rate union of the two small countries with the large partner has no effect on their real exchange rates but affects their price levels, whereas a full monetary union requires in principle a transfer from the large partner in the union. The allocation of this transfer between the two small countries by their common central bank will have real effects when the allocation rule differs from the steady-state monetary distribution.\n\n",
