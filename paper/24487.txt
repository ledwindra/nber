ABSTRACT
We study the effect of two local immigration enforcement policies – Section 287(g) of the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act and the Secure Communities Program
(SC) – that have escalated fear and risk of deportation among the undocumented on the health
and mental health outcomes of Latino immigrants living in the United States. We use the
restricted-use National Health Interview Survey for 2000-2012 and adopt a difference-indifference research design. Estimates suggest that SC increased the proportion of Latino
immigrants with mental health distress by 2.2 percentage points (14.7 percent); Task Force
Enforcement under Section 287(g) worsened their mental health distress scores by 15 percent
(0.08 standard deviation); Jail Enforcement under Section 287(g) increased the proportion of
Latino immigrants reporting fair or poor health by 1 percentage point (11.1 percent) and lowered
the proportion reporting very good or excellent health by 4.8 to 7.0 percentage points (7.8 to 10.9
percent). These findings are robust across various sensitivity checks.

Health and Mental Health Effects of Local Immigration Enforcement
INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, the terrain of immigration enforcement in the United States has
expanded from national borders to local and state jurisdictions, resulting in an increasing number
of arrests on grounds of immigration status and national origin (Lacayo, 2010). 1 Involvement of
local and state governments in immigration enforcement intensifies fears of deportation and is
likely to cause stress and adversely impact the physical and mental health of undocumented
immigrants and their family members, many of whom may be U.S. citizens. 2 Local enforcement
is also likely to make undocumented immigrants and their families more vulnerable to workplace
exploitation, reduce their social interactions and use of essential public services, and generally
increase mistrust towards public institutions, in particular local law enforcement agencies
(Gleeson, 2014; Hacker et al., 2011; Hardy et al., 2011; Rhodes et al., 2015).
Previous research documents that local and state government participation in immigration
enforcement has affected immigrant settlement patterns, employment, and earnings, and patterns
of farm labor use and farm profitability (Pham & Van, 2010; Capps, Rosenblum, Rodriquez, &
Chishti. 2011; Kostandini, Mykerezi, & Escalante, 2013; Watson, 2013). Local or state-specific
studies using qualitative approaches also suggest that local enforcement increased stress and
anxiety among immigrants and deterred them from seeking health services (Rhodes et al., 2015;
1

During 2006-2012, local officials deputized under 287(g) arrested 256,330 undocumented immigrants (ICE FOIA,
2015). In 2008, the number of removals under 287(g) represented 9.5% of all ICE immigrant removals, with a noninsignificant number being removed based on minor traffic offenses such as driving without license or driving under
the influence (Lacayo, 2010; Vaughan & Edwards, 2009).
2
In the 2008 National Survey of Latinos administered by Pew Hispanic Center, nearly 10% of Hispanic adults (both
native-born and immigrants) reported being asked by the police or other authorities about their immigration status in
the past year, and 35% of native-born Hispanic citizens said that they worried “a lot or some” about deportation of
relatives, or friends (Lopez & Minushikin, 2008). Lacayo (2010) cites anecdotal evidence of Latinos being subject to
racial profiling and were increasingly pulled over and interrogated for minor offenses as an excuse to check their
documentation status.

2

Hacker et al., 2011). There is, however, little systematic national research on health and mental
health effects of local immigration enforcement, resulting in a critical knowledge gap on the full
range of impacts of what has become a salient feature of the U.S. government’s approach to
undocumented immigration and is being vigorously pursued by the Trump administration.
In this paper, we bridge this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of two local
enforcement policy initiatives: Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Secure Communities program (SC). Section 287(g) gave
local jurisdictions the option to participate in immigration enforcement with two types of
agreements: Task Force Enforcement (TF) allowed state and local law enforcement to screen for
immigration status during regular policing operations (street screening) and Jail Enforcement
(JE) allowed screening for immigration status in jails. The Secure Communities program
required matching fingerprinting of all arrested individuals with the Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) database to screen for immigration violations. We take advantage of the
geographic (county-level) and temporal variations in the implementation of these policies. The
empirical analysis is based on the restricted-use National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (20002012) that provides information on health and mental health conditions as well as county- and
state-level identifiers to match policy variables to the individual-level health and demographic
data.
We adopt a difference-in-difference research design to control for unobserved timevarying factors correlated with county/state level enforcement policies. This methodology
requires selection of treatment and comparison groups. The treatment group of our analyses is:
foreign-born Latino adults living in families with at least one non-citizen family member. Due to
the high probability of the presence of undocumented persons in these families, this group is

3

likely to be highly vulnerable to local enforcement policies. We also experiment with a narrower
treatment group that has an even heightened risk of having undocumented family members and
therefore higher vulnerability to local enforcement: non-citizen Latino adults living in families
with only non-citizen family members. The comparison group of the analysis is U.S. born nonHispanic white adults, whose members are unlikely to be affected by enforcement policies. The
underlying assumption of the difference-in-difference design is that time-varying unobserved
factors correlated with state/county enforcement policies have the same effect on the two groups.
We obtain the difference-in-difference estimates by deducting the changes in outcomes for the
comparison group before and after policy implementation, that capture the effect of unobserved
time-varying factors, from the corresponding changes in outcomes for the treatment group.
Additionally, our analyses control for a rich set of economic and policy variables, discussed in
detail below, whose effects are allowed to be different across the treatment and comparison
groups.
We find that the Secure Communities Program increased mental health distress among
Latino immigrants living with non-citizen family members by 2.2 percentage points (14.7
percent), and Task Force Enforcement agreements under Section 287(g) deteriorated their mental
health distress scores by 15 percent (or 0.08 standard deviation); Jail Enforcement under Section
287(g) increased the proportion of Latino immigrants reporting fair or poor health by 1
percentage point (11.1 percent) and lowered the proportion reporting very good or excellent
health by 4.8 to 7.0 percentage points (7.8 to 10.9 percent). These findings remain robust across
various sensitivity checks.
LOCAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT POLICIES – SECTION 287(G) AND
SECURE COMMUNITIES

4

In 1996, with the ostensible goal to improve public safety and remove illegal immigrants
who committed serious offenses, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act, Section 287(g) granted state and local jurisdictions the option to participate in enforcing
federal immigration laws. Localities opting to participate signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with ICE that required establishing a supervisory structure to support localities
and train local officials to enforce immigration laws. Local participation in Section 287(g) was
negligible in the first decade after its passage. In 2002, Florida Department of Law Enforcement
and in 2003 Alabama Department of Public Safety were the first two localities to sign 287(g)
agreements with ICE. Local participation in 287(g) slowly picked up in 2005 and peaked in
2009, when the number of localities participating in the program rose to 76. Twenty-four
jurisdictions signed Task Force Enforcement (TF) agreements, 47 signed Jail Enforcement (JE)
agreements, and 5 signed both TF and JE. Overall, TF agreements covered 22% (690 out of 3140
counties) of the counties nationally, and JE agreements cover 3% (106 counties) of all counties
(Figure 1).
Interior immigration enforcement took another turn in 2008 with the launch of the Secure
Communities Program (SC) that required the local police to match fingerprints of all arrested
individuals with the ICE database to screen for immigration violations. Whereas Section 287(g)
was designed to engage local law enforcement in immigration enforcement, Secure Communities
allowed ICE a remote presence in local law enforcement agencies. Under SC, the state and local
authorities were required to submit fingerprints of all arrested individuals to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), which the latter shared with ICE to check against immigration databases
to identify (removable) undocumented individuals (ICE, 2015). Unlike Section 287(g),
participation in Secure Communities was not voluntary. It was gradually rolled out across

5

counties: beginning with 14 counties in 2008 to all counties nation-wide in 2013 (Figure 1). 3 In
response to public concerns about racial profiling, in 2012, TF was discontinued and in 2015, SC
was replaced by the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) that focuses on immigrants involved in
organized criminal gangs or those that pose a danger to national security (ICE, 2016).
Previous research suggests that stricter local immigration controls reduced the economic
opportunities of immigrants, lowering their employment, wages, and remittances (Kostandini,
Mykerezi, & Escalante, 2013; Pham & Van, 2010; Gentsch & Massey, 2011; Amuedo-Dorantes
& Puttitanun, 2013). The implementation of Section 287(g) was also associated with a decrease
in claims against employers’ discrimination based on national origin, indicating that enforcement
policies had a “chilling effect” on vulnerable immigrants (Gleeson, 2014). Studies suggest that
enforcement policies had a mixed impact on crime: Koper et al. (2013) found no effect in Prince
William County, Virginia, whereas Donato & Rodriquez (2014) reported a higher rate of police
arrests on grounds of immigration status and national origin in Davidson County, Tennessee.
Evidence is also mixed on the effect of local enforcement on migration patterns: Watson (2013)
found that Task Force Enforcement policies increased the outflow of non-citizens with some
college education, Ellis, Wright and Townley (2016) found that hostile immigration policies (e.g.,
local immigration enforcement policies, E-Verify, access to driver’s licenses) in a state reduced
the inflow of non-citizen and naturalized Latinos in that state, whereas Parrado (2012) found that
287(g) did not affect the size of Mexican immigrant population in most localities except for large
cities such as Dallas, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Phoenix, which registered a decline in the
number of Mexican immigrants relative to other large cities without 287(g). In addition, research

3

Some localities resisted the implementation of SC (Chen, 2016; Strunk & Leitner, 2013), but such initiatives were
not systematically and reliably documented for a national-level examination of their impacts. To the extent that such
intentions are a permanent (time-invariant) feature of a locality (e.g., if a locality has a strong long term pro- or antiimmigrant environment), county fixed effects included in our analysis will control for it.

suggests that local immigration enforcement increased Latino housing foreclosure rates (Rugh &
Hall, 2016) and food insecurity and poverty in vulnerable families with children (AmuedoDorantes, Arenas-Arroyo & Sevilla, 2016, Potochnick, Chen, & Perreira, 2016; Rugh & Hall,
2016).
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AND HEALTH
Immigration is a stressful undertaking with negative psychosocial impacts (Vega &
Amaro, 1994; Jasso et al., 2004). It is associated with increased stress, fear, and uncertainty. For
families with undocumented members, the negative health effects of migration are more intense
and complicated (Sullivan & Rehm, 2005; Delva et al., 2013). Repeated exposure to prejudice,
discrimination, and exploitation on account of immigration status, and concerns about disclosure
and deportation, of oneself or a family member, are likely to leave a negative impact on the
physical as well as mental health of the undocumented and their family members (Vega &
Amaro, 1994; Cavazor-Rehg et al., 2007; Sullivan & Rehm, 2005).
Immigration enforcement policies may affect health status of undocumented immigrants
and their families in several ways. First, enforcement policies increase the risk of deportation and
will likely to increase stress, fear, and anxiety among undocumented immigrants and their family
members, which may adversely affect their health. Second, increased risk of deportation is likely
to reduce economic opportunities of the undocumented and increase risk of workplace
exploitation, which could in turn have negative health and mental health effects. Third, to
minimize risk of deportation, the undocumented may reduce their time driving on the road,
which may result in isolation and reduced social interaction and health service utilization
(Rhodes et al., 2015; Hardy et al., 2011). Fourth, local enforcement may escalate immigrants’
levels of mistrust toward public institutions, further lowering their health and social service

7

utilization (Watson, 2014; Padraza & Zhu, 2015; Rhodes et al., 2015; Cavazos-Rehg, Zayas &
Spitznagel, 2007). Finally, to cope with the escalated psychological and economic burden
associated with the increased risk and exploitation, immigrants may adopt certain unhealthy
behaviors (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption) leading to health deterioration. 4
Most prior studies investigating the effects of local enforcement on health and mental
health of immigrants were at a state- or local-level. Rhodes and colleagues (2015) study the
impact of Section 287(g) on Hispanic immigrants in local counties in North Carolina; Hacker et
al. (2011) study impacts of ICE activities in Everett, Massachusetts; Hardy et al. (2011) study the
impact of the SB 1070 in Arizona, a bill that made failure to possess immigration documents a
crime and expanded police power to detain potentially undocumented residents; and Lopez et al.
(2016) study the impact of an immigration raid in the Washtenaw County, Michigan. The first
three papers have used qualitative interviews and focus groups to study the effect of local
enforcement. 5 Respondents in these studies stated that they avoid using health care and other
social services because of the threat of police enforcement while driving and their lack of trust in
public institutions. They also reported delays in preventive services, incomplete sequence of care,
reduced utilization of preventive and curative care, increased use of nonstandard and unsafe
contingencies for care, and deterioration in mental health among family members.
Previous studies on the relationships between immigration enforcement and health did
not specifically study the impact of 287(g) or Secure Communities policies. Lopez and
colleagues (2016) used survey data collected before (n=325) and after (n=151) an immigration

4

These mechanisms closely mirror the framework through which Philbin and colleagues (2017) conceptualize how
immigration-related policies may influence the health among Latinos.
5
Rhodes and colleagues (2015) also used vital records data to quantitatively examine impacts of 287(g) on two
measures of prenatal care: late entry into care and inadequate care. They found that 287(g) delayed Hispanic/Latina
mothers to seek prenatal care and increased their likelihood to receive inadequate care compared to nonHispanic/Latina mothers. However, health and mental health impacts of 287(g) were only examined qualitatively
through interviews and focus groups.

raid and found that completing the survey after the raid was associated with lower self-rated
health and higher stress. Hatzenbuehler et al. (2017) used 14 policies in the domains of
immigration, race/ethnicity, language, and agricultural worker protections to create a policy
climate index and used the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for 2012 to examine the
association between the policy climate and immigrant mental health. Their research suggests that
states that scored higher on the policy climate index, signifying a more exclusionary policy
environment, were associated with poor mental health days in the past month among adults, and
such association was stronger for Latinos. But this study is based on one year of data, because of
which it is difficult to distinguish the effect of enforcement policies from those of unobserved
state and county factors.
There is no national level study of the effect of local immigration enforcement on health
and mental health of the undocumented and their family members. Ours is the first study to use
national data. Secondly, studies on the relationships between immigration enforcement and
health have mostly treated enforcement as a cluster of policies. We study the impact of specific
dimensions of enforcement, namely: Task Force enforcement under 287(g), Jail Enforcement
under 287 (g) and Secure Communities program. Finally, none of the existing studies used
rigorous econometric models to identify the causal effects of local immigration enforcement on
health and mental health of Latino immigrants, as we do in our paper.
This research is critical as negative health and mental health in immigrant communities
has economic and fiscal consequences, including increased public health expenditures and
reduced labor productivity (Brown et al., 2002; Martin et al., 2008; DeSalvo et al., 2009;
Pirraglia et al., 2011; Bernard, Farr, & Fang, 2011). Heightened health care costs along with the
burden of poor health would adversely affect the wellbeing of immigrants in low-income

9

neighborhoods and slow down their integration with the mainstream society. In this study, we
take advantage of the “natural experiments” created by variations in the implementation of local
immigration enforcement under Section 287(g) and Secure Community initiative across
geographic locations (state and local jurisdictions) and time to study their effects on the health
and mental health of the undocumented and their families.
RESEARCH DESIGN
Our objective is to study health impacts of local immigration enforcement on not only the
undocumented immigrants, who are directly affected by local immigration enforcement, but also
their family members who may be legal immigrants or U.S. citizens. The analysis is conducted
on two samples of adults aged 18 to 60, born in Latin America (Latino immigrants hereafter):
those in households with at least one non-citizen member (treat 1) and those in households with
only non-citizen family members (and no citizens in the family; treat 2). We focus on these
groups because 77 percent of all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. come from Latin
America, with Mexico being the largest country of origin (56% of all undocumented immigrants),
followed by Guatemala (6%), El Salvador (4%), and Honduras (3%) (Passel & Cohn, 2011;
Zong & Batalova, 2016). Estimates show that 47% of foreign-born Latinos or 68% of non-citizen
Latinos in the U.S. were undocumented in 2012 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012; Zong & Batalova,
2016). 6 Restricting samples of analyses to Latino immigrants in households with at least one
non-citizen or without any citizen (treatment groups hereafter) allows us to capture households
most affected by the enforcement policies. We hypothesize that local immigration enforcement

6

In 2012, the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. was estimated as 11.4 million, and 77% of them
were from Latin America (Zong & Batalova, 2016). This suggests that there were approximately 8.8 million Latino
undocumented persons living in the U.S. (11,400,000 x 0.77 = 8,778,000). The number of foreign-born and noncitizen populations who identified as Latino in 2012 was 18,579,270 and 12,977,027, respectively (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2012). Thus approximately 47% of foreign born Latinos (8,778,000 / 18,579,270 = 0.47) or 68% of noncitizen Latinos (8,778,000 / 12,977,027 = 0.68) in the U.S. were undocumented.

policies adversely affect the health and mental health of Latino immigrants in households with at
least one non-citizen, and effects will be even stronger for those living in households where all
members are non-citizens, since they are more likely to be undocumented and hence have a
higher risk of being directly affected by enforcement policies.
A primary challenge in any nation-wide study of the undocumented in the U.S. is that
national data sources do not provide information on the legal status of foreign-born persons, so it
is impossible to determine whether an immigrant respondent is an undocumented or legal
resident. 7 We try to address this limitation by identifying groups that have a high likelihood of
being undocumented. We acknowledge that there may be some individuals in the treatment
group/s that are unaffected by enforcement, which would result in estimates biased towards zero.
We begin with the following regression equation estimated separately on a sample of
each of the treatment groups described above:
𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐 + 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 + 𝜒𝜒1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜒𝜒2 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜒𝜒3 𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝜑𝜑 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∆ + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,
i = 1, …, N (persons)
c = 1, …, C (counties)
t = 2000, …, 2012 (years)

(1)

where 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 represents a health outcome of individual i (or a mental health outcome; described in
detail in the Measures section); 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is coded as 1 if county c has a Task Force Enforcement

agreement with ICE in year t, otherwise 0; 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , equals to 1 if county c has a Jail Enforcement
agreement with ICE in year t, otherwise 0; and 𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 equals to 1 if county c has a Secure

Communities agreement in year t, otherwise 0. The reference category for each of the three
policy variables - 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , and 𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 - is counties without the corresponding policy. The

Researchers have explored strategies to impute legal status from survey data (Hall, Greeman, & Farkas, 2010). The
most suitable health data set for this study, NHIS, does not collect necessary information to replicate these
imputation strategies.

equation includes a full set of county fixed effects (𝛽𝛽𝑐𝑐 ) 8 and year fixed effects (𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 ); time-varying

county characteristics (𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) namely county unemployment rate in year t, county poverty rate in
year t, whether the county had applied for a 287(g) agreement with ICE in year t or earlier that

was denied or withdrawn, 9 whether the county is located in a state that provides in-state tuition
subsidy to undocumented residents in year t, whether the county is located in a state that allows
undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver’s license in year t, whether the county is located in
a state that has implemented a policy in year t under the Omnibus Bill regulations, 10 and whether
the county is located in a state that passed E-Verify in year t; 11 individual characteristics (𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) 12

namely age, sex, marital status, education level, household size, family income, citizenship status,
years lived in the U.S., cohort of arrival, and country/region of origin; 13 whether the interview

Inclusion of county and year fixed effects allows the estimation of policy impacts within the same county after
controlling for secular time-trends.
9
More than one hundred unsuccessful 287(g) requests (denied or withdrawn) were filed by county, city or state
governments. Requests for 287(g) agreements (withdrawn or denied) are indicative of a certain discriminatory
environment towards the undocumented. Explicitly controlling for whether counties had requested to sign 287(g)
with ICE in year t or earlier results in a cleaner comparison group. Additionally, including 287(g) requests as a
policy category can explicitly estimate the effect of such discriminatory policy environment in the absence of policy
implementation.
10
Omnibus bills “require law enforcement to attempt to determine the immigration status of a person involved in a
lawful stop; allow state residents to sue state and local agencies for noncompliance with immigration enforcement;
require E-Verify; and make it a state violation for failure to carry an alien registration document (NCSL, 2012).” In
some states, the Omnibus Bill regulations include policies forbidding undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s
license or ID cards, policies that make it a felony for an undocumented immigrant to enter into business transactions
with government, such as applying for or renewing a motor vehicle license plate or a business license, policies that
make it illegal for a person to transport an immigrant; conceal, harbor or shield an undocumented immigrant, and
policies denying public benefits to undocumented immigrants (NCSL, 2012).
11
We acknowledge that there were also sanctuary localities across the U.S. County fixed effects included in our
models can account for county-level time-invarying (during 2000 and 2012) hostile or friendly policy environment.
We also conducted sensitivity analyses excluding sanctuary states from our analyses, and the results do not differ.

The detailed coding of these controls are as follow: age ((omitted category 18-24), 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 4549, 50-54, 55-60), gender (male), marital status (married), education level (less than 9 years, 9-12 years (no high
school degree), (omitted category: high school degree or GED), some colleges or more), household size (dummy
variables indicating household size: 1, 2, (omitted category: 3-4), 5+), log family income, language of interview (not

county of residence.

One possible confounder in equation (1) is the presence of unobserved time-varying
factors correlated with enforcement policies that would affect the health and mental health of
Latino immigrants. For example, during the period of our study many states implemented
policies (e.g., the Dream Acts, E-verify, Drivers’ license, omnibus bills, etc.) that directly
affected the wellbeing of undocumented immigrants. In addition, our study spans over a period
of high economic instability, including the Great Recession. Previous studies find that the Great
Recession lowered immigrants’ employment more than that of the U.S. born population (Liu &
Edwards, 2015; Orrenius & Zavodny, 2010). Evidence on health effect of the Great Recession is
mixed ranging from negative to negligible to positive (Burgard, Ailshire, & Kalousova, 2013;
Tekin, McClellan, & Minyard, 2013). While the implementation of Secure Communities
coincided with the Great Recession, research suggests that the roll out schedule was not related
to local economic conditions (Cox & Miles, 2013).
To account for the influence of time-varying factors correlated with enforcement policies,
equation (1) includes a rich set of time-varying county level factors (𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ), including county

unemployment rate, poverty rate, and local policies that impacted immigrants. Further, we use a
difference-in-difference (DD) research design, described in equation (2), to estimate enforcement
policy effects over a combined sample of the treatment and comparison groups:
𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝜆𝜆1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆2 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆3 𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑟𝑟1 (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) + 𝜆𝜆𝑟𝑟2 (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 ∗ 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) +

13

Tr is equal to 1 if the respondent belongs to the treatment group, otherwise 0. 14 The differencein-difference coefficients, 𝜆𝜆𝑟𝑟1, 𝜆𝜆𝑟𝑟2, and 𝜆𝜆𝑟𝑟3 , estimate the effects of Task force enforcement, Jail
Enforcement and Secure Community Initiative, respectively, on the treatment group. Note that

we allow the effect of time-varying factors to differ across the treatment and comparison groups
by including interactions between the Treatment variable Tr and the vector denoting county-level
time-varying factors 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 . 15 Our primary treatment group is: foreign-born Latino adults living in

families with at least one non-citizen family member (treat 1) and comparison group is: U.S.

born non-Hispanic white adults. We also experiment with a narrower treatment group of noncitizen Latino adults living in families with only non-citizen family members (treat 2), whose
members have an even higher probability of being undocumented or have undocumented friends
or family members than treat 1. 16 The identifying assumption in equation (2) is that unobserved
time-varying factors have the same effect on the outcome variables for the treatment and
comparison groups. We conduct a number of tests to check the validity of the assumption and
results are discussed in the section on sensitivity analysis.
A possible threat to our model specification could arise if the population most affected by
local and state immigration enforcement decided to return to their countries of origin or relocated
in another locality with a lesser threat of local enforcement. As indicated earlier, Watson (2013)
found that while 287(g) did not result in voluntary emigration, Task Force enforcement increased

To control for the main effects of being Latino immigrant adults, instead of using one dummy variable, the
empirical analysis includes years since immigration (0-5, 6-10, 11-15, 15+), cohort of arrival ((omitted category
before 1987), 1987-1991, 1992-1996, 1997-2001, 2002-2012), citizenship status, and country/region of origin
(Central America, Mexico, South America) in the analytic model. This way, we control for the heterogeneous
composition of Latino immigrant adults. In treatment status’ interactions with policy variables (or county-level timevarying characteristics), we use one single dummy variable for Latino immigrants adults to construct the interactions.
15
We also experiment with models that include the interactions between Tr and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (individual demographic
factors), and findings are similar to our presented results.

We also experimented with two additional comparison groups: U.S. born Hispanics and U.S. born non-Hispanic
black adults, and results are discussed in the section on Sensitivity Analysis.

at least some college education. On the other hand, Parrado (2012) found that 287(g) did not
affect the size of Mexican immigrant population in most localities except for large cities such as
Dallas, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Phoenix. There is not much we can do address this problem.
In the event that immigrants who migrated out of a locality were the more privileged and
healthier, our estimated policy effects would be upward biased. However, the out-migration of
privileged fellow immigrants may weaken Latino communities and thus worsen health and
mental health of the immigrants that are left behind. However, if those who decided to relocate
were most adversely affected by policies, our estimated policy effects would be biased towards
zero.
High non-response rates among the affected population constitute an additional source of
bias. The NHIS asks respondents to provide their social security numbers (SSN). Although
respondents could refuse and indeed more than 60% of Latino immigrants have done so (CarterPokras & Fischer, 2010), this request may increase the probability of undocumented immigrants
and their family members refusing to participate in the survey. Furthermore, the non-response
patterns may be correlated with the policy variables. That is, the survey response rates could be
lower among immigrants living in counties with immigration enforcement policies in the postpolicy period. Higher non-response among affected population is also likely to yield estimates
that are biased towards zero, leading to a more conservative estimation or underestimation of the
actual policy effects.
DATA
The empirical analysis requires merging the Section 287(g) and Secure Communities
policy variables to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data (2000-2012). NHIS is a
nationally representative cross-sectional survey administered by the Centers for Disease Control

15

and Prevention (CDC) that collect health-related information annually. NHIS adopts a stratified
multistage sample design (CDC, 2017). Data on core health indicators (e.g. self-rated health) are
collected from all household members. NHIS also includes a module on Sample Adult, in which
one adult (aged 18 or more) is randomly selected from each family to answer additional
questions (e.g., mental health distress questions) (CDC, 2017). Because of confidentiality and
disclosure rules, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) does not provide state/county
level identifiers in the public use NHIS. Our analysis is based on the restricted-use NHIS that has
state/county level identifiers. All data analyses were conducted at the New York Census Data
Center upon approval from the NCHS Research Data Center, who also enabled merging of
policy variables by county and year with the micro-level NHIS data. The restricted-use NHIS
also provide detailed information on immigrants’ year of entry in the U.S., which are used to
construct control variables on the cohort of arrival and years since immigration.
The NHIS oversamples the Hispanic population, yielding a relatively large sample for
our analyses. Because Latino immigrants cluster in a small number of counties in the U.S., the
empirical analysis is based on 306 counties with at least 20 observations of Latino immigrants to
avoid spurious results on account of a small number of observations in a few counties. 17
Multiple sources have been used to compile data on the histories of policies and
contextual economic environment. Data on local enforcement policies by county and year are
from the ICE obtained through a FOIA request. The initiation dates of Secure Communities
program are from publicly available ICE documents (ICE, 2013). The state Dream Act policy
data are from various published papers (Kaushal, 2008; Kaushal & Wang, 2016). Information on
state policies relevant to undocumented immigrants such as eligibility to obtain driver’s license,

17

We also experimented with a higher cut-off – counties with at least 50 non-citizen Latino immigrants – and the
results are similar (presented in Table 3).

omnibus bills, and E-Verify is from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL)
websites (NCSL, 2012; NCSL, 2015a, 2015b). The county-level unemployment rates and
poverty rates are from the Area Resource Files (released by Health Resources and Services
Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services).
MEASURES
We study several dimensions of health and mental health of Latino immigrants (Table 1).
Each individual in NHIS is asked to scale his/her subjective health status as excellent, very good,
good, fair and poor, which we use to create two measures of self-reported health: Poor health is
equal to 1 if a respondent reported their health as poor or fair, otherwise 0; Good health is equal
1 to if a respondent reported their health as very good or excellent, otherwise 0. Self-rated health
is considered a valid measure of overall health and mental health as it strongly predicts serious,
chronic conditions, disability, health service utilization, mental illnesses as well as mortality
(Goldstein, Siegel, & Boyer, 1984; Burström & Fredlund, 2001; Wu et al., 2013). It is also a
reliable measure with a test-retest reliability similar to or better than those of many objective
health condition questions (e.g., asthma, backache, and headaches/migraine) (Lundberg &
Manderbacka, 1996).
From each family in the NHIS, one sample adult (aged 18 or more) is randomly selected
to answer questions, including those on respondent’s mental health, in the survey’s Sample Adult
module. We used the following six questions to measure mental health: In the past 30 days, how
often did you feel so sad so that nothing could cheer you up? In the past 30 days, how often did
you feel nervous? In the past 30 days, how often did you feel restless and fidgety? In the past 30
days, how often did you feel hopeless? In the past 30 days, how often did you feel that
everything was an effort? In the past 30 days, how often did you feel worthless? Respondents are

17

asked to provide answers to these questions on a scale of 0 to 4 (none of the time, a little of the
time, some of the time, most of the time, and all of the time). These six questions belong to the
Kessler 6 (K6) scale (Kessler et al., 2002). We construct a measure (scale) of psychological
distress based on these questions that ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score representing worse
mental health. The internal consistency of items in the scale is high (Cronbach’s 𝛼𝛼 = 0.88),

indicating good reliability. We also recode the mental health score into a dichotomous measure:
mental health distress (1 indicating respondent’s mental health score is 6 or more, otherwise 0).
This dichotomous measure of mental health distress is associated with higher levels of mental
health care utilization, mental health impairment, substance use, sedentary behavior, and obesity
(Prochaska et al., 2012).
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the demographic and health characteristics of adults, aged 18 to 60,
during 2000-2001, the pre-policy years covered by our analysis. We focus on two treatment
groups: Latino immigrant adults in households with at least one non-citizen family member (treat
1) and Latino immigrant adults with only non-citizen (no citizen) family members (treat 2).
While this second group of Latino immigrants has a higher probability of being undocumented or
having undocumented family members, the restriction reduces the sample size, which may
reduce our ability to detect small size effects, so we present descriptive statistics and findings for
both groups. We also present the descriptive statistics of the comparison group, U.S. born nonHispanic White adults, whose members are unlikely to be affected by enforcement measures.
Latino immigrants in households with some or all non-citizen family members have a
more disadvantageous socioeconomic status compared to U.S. born White adults. Over 77
percent Latino immigrant adults do not have college education compared to 36 percent U.S. born

18

White adults. Latino immigrants are younger, more likely to be male, have larger household
sizes but lower average incomes than the non-Hispanic White sample. Approximately two thirds
of the Latino samples were interviewed in a language other than English, whereas almost all of
the U.S. born non-Hispanic White adults were interviewed in English.
In respect to health outcomes, there are two main points to note. One, Latino immigrants
are two to three percentage points (33 to 50%) more likely to report fair to poor health and 10 to
13 percentage points (14 to 18%) less likely to report excellent or very good health compared to
U.S. born White adults. The difference in self-reported health could be a measure of the overall
gap in health outcomes between these groups or it could simply be an indicator of the cultural
difference in the manner in which these groups describe their health (Viruell-Fuentes et al.,
2011). Two, the overall mental health of Latino immigrants is better than that of U.S. born White
adults.
Table 2 presents the effect of local immigration enforcement policies on the health and
mental health outcomes of Latino immigrants. The first three columns report findings from the
first difference models based on equation (1) for the two treatment groups and the comparison
group. All models control for age, gender, marital status, educational level, household size, log
family income, county unemployment rate, county poverty rate, whether the state of residence
has legislations related to undocumented immigrants (a dummy variable for each of the
following policies: state Dream Act, driver’s license, omnibus bills and E-Verify) in year t, as
described in detail in the research methodology section and listed as notes to the Table, and
county and year fixed effects. The foreign-born Latino samples further control for years since
immigration, cohort of arrival, citizenship status, and region/country of origin. The last two
columns present findings from the difference-in-difference (DD) models (equation 2) using a

19

combined sample of treat 1 and comparison group (column 4) and treat 2 and comparison group
(column 5). These models allow county/state-specific time-varying factors to differ for the
treatment and comparison groups. The findings presented in the first three columns are
coefficients from the policy variables, and the last two columns present coefficients from the
interactions between the policy variables and the treatment status variable (treat 1 in column 4;
treat 2 in column 5). While we present first difference results for the comparison group, for
brevity we do not discuss those results, but simply note here that, as expected, in general the
estimated effects of enforcement policies on the comparison group are modest and statistically
insignificant (11 out of 12 reported coefficients in Table 2 for the comparison group are
statistically insignificant).
Regressions in Table 2 are based on OLS models. 18 Estimates in panel (1), column (1)
suggest that SC increased the likelihoods of Latino immigrants in households with non-citizen
members rating their overall health fair or poor by 1.4 to 2.7 percentage points (16 to 34 percent),
and Task Force enforcement (TF) increased the likelihood of treat 2 reporting fair to poor health
by 2.1 percentage points (26 percent), but had no statistically significant effect on treat 1’s
probability of reporting poor/fair health. The difference-in-difference estimates that control for
time-varying factors in a more parsimonious manner suggest that both Secure Communities (SC)
and Jail Enforcement (JE) increased the probability of treat 1 reporting fair/poor health by 1 to
1.3 percentage points (11.1 to 14.4 percent). The difference-in-difference estimate of the effect
of enforcement policies on treat 2 reporting poor/fair health was statistically insignificant. First
stage estimates in panel (2) suggest that JE lowered Latino immigrants’ probability of reporting

18

We also estimate dichotomous outcomes (poor health, good health, and mental health distress) using logistic
regression models. Results are presented in Appendix Table C and are qualitatively the same as results from linear
regression models. In addition, we present full results with all covariates (except for county and year fixed effects)
in Appendix Table E.

20

very good or excellent health by 3.4 to 7.1 percentage points (5.6 to 11.1 percent). The DD
estimates also show that JE lowered the probability of the treatment groups reporting excellent or
very good health by 4.8 to 7.0 percentage points (7.9 to 10.9 percent).
Turning to the third outcome, mental health distress scores (higher values indicate higher
levels of mental health distress), estimates show that TF increased the mental health score of
treat 1 and treat 2 groups by 19.7 to 42.1 percent (=0.429/2.18 to 0.951/2.26), or 0.11 to 0.23
standard deviation, respectively. In the DD models, that allow controlling for unobserved timevarying factors, both SC and TF increased the mental health scores of the treatment groups by
9.8 to 14.8 percent, or 0.05 to 0.08 standard deviation. The point estimates for treat 2 are larger
than those for treat 1, but not always statistically significant.
Our fourth and last outcome is a dichotomized indicator of mental health distress (K6
mental health scale≥6). Estimates from the first difference model show that Task Force
enforcement was associated with a 3 to 8 percentage points (20 to 53.3 percent) increase in
prevalence of mental health distress among Latino immigrants. Estimates from the difference-indifference models indicate that SC increased the likelihood mental health distress by 2.2 to 3.2
percentage points (14.7 to 21.3 percent), and TF increased it by 2 to 3.5 percentage points (13.3
to 23.3 percent). 19,20
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
We also estimated the effect of policy on severe mental distress (defined as Kessler 6 Scale: ≥ 12 points). Only
three percent of the two treatment groups and the comparison group report severe mental distress in our sample.
Estimates from the first difference models suggest that TF increased the likelihood of severe mental health distress
among treat 1 members, but we find no effects in difference-in-difference models.
20
Prior studies have shown that stress suppresses the immune system and gets manifested in illnesses (Salleh, 2008).
Chronic stress is also related to asthma, back pain, and migraine headaches (Salleh, 2008). Following previous
research, we examine impacts of local immigration enforcement policies on a range of physical health conditions
(Appendix Table D). Results from the DD models suggested that overall no effect on physical health conditions
except in two cases: TF increased likelihoods of back or neck pain, and JE decreased the likelihood of asthma. The
latter finding is contrary to our hypothesis. Lack of any effect for the other outcomes might suggest that it takes a
longer time for heightened degree of stress to manifest on physical health outcomes.
19

21

We conduct a number of sensitivity checks to investigate the robustness of our findings.
The results from these analyses are presented in Table 3. For brevity, we present only the
difference-in-difference estimates with treat 1 as the treatment group 21 (same model as column 4
in Table 2). First, to reduce the influence of immigration patterns that may be correlated with
enforcement policies (e.g., new immigrants being more selective on health than immigrants who
arrived in the U.S. before enforcement policies were enacted), we restricted the analyses to
respondents who arrived before 2002, which is before any jurisdiction adopted local immigration
enforcement policies (columns 1). Second, we checked whether employing a stricter county
inclusion criterion (having 50 or more Latino non-citizens in each county instead of 20) affected
the results of our analyses (column 2). Third, we restricted our analyses to counties that were
surveyed across all years (denoted as the balanced sample) to examine if our findings were
affected by unbalanced panels across years (column 3). 22 Our balanced panel of counties
included about 70% of the original sample.
In columns 4 and 5, we conduct additional sensitivity analyses to address the concern that
other unobserved time-varying factors correlated with the policy adoption may bias our results.
Findings from prior studies showed that the adoption of 287(g) and Secure Communities policies
was not random. For example, counties that experienced high level and growth in Hispanic
population were more likely to pass 287(g) and Secure Communities policies (Cox & Miles,
2013; Creek & Yoder, 2012; Wong, 2012; Walker & Leitner, 2011). In column 4, we restrict the
sample of analysis to counties with density of people with Hispanic ethnicity in 2001 being more
than the national average (similar to the approach adopted by Potochnick, Chen, & Perreira,
21
Many of the tests involve further restrictions of the analytic sample. Therefore, we present results from the larger
of the treatment groups (Treat 1).
22
NHIS regularly adjusts its sampling plan according to updated information from the recent Census. The redesign
during the study period (2000-2012) happened in 2006. Some counties were a part of NHIS samples prior to 2006
but not after, and some counties were sampled by NHIS after but not prior to 2006.

22

2016). This allows us to compare counties with relatively similar levels of Hispanic population
prior to policy adoption. In column 5, we restrict the analyses to counties that have either
adopted or requested to form a 287(g) agreement with ICE. Arguably, counties with more hostile
political attitudes toward immigrants are more likely to apply to ICE for local immigration
enforcement, and this contextual environment may affect immigrants’ health and mental health.
Excluding counties that have not initiated a 287(g) agreement allows us to compare counties with
similar political environment towards undocumented immigrants (Potochnick, Chen, & Perreira,
2016). Further, we also estimate models that do not include any control for the 287(g) request
(column 6).
One criticism of our models is that secular trends in health outcomes of the treatment
groups during the 2000s may be confounding the enforcement policy estimates. In column 7, we
present estimates from a model that further control for these trends by including a full set of year
effects interacted with the treatment group. We also experimented with two other treatment
groups. In column 8 the treatment group is Mexican non-citizen adults and in column 9 the
treatment group is Latino non-citizen adults.
Overall, a number of findings remain robust across various models. One, JE reduced the
proportion of Latino immigrants reporting very good/excellent health by 3.9 to 5.0 percentage
points in all 9 models. Two, JE increased the proportion of Latino immigrants reporting fair/poor
health by 0.5 to 1.2 percentage points, with the estimates being statistically insignificant in some
models. Three, SC increased mental health distress (based on a dichotomized measure) among
Latino immigrants by 0.4 to 2.6 percentage points with the effects being statistically significant
in 7 out of 9 models; and TF deteriorated mental health scores of Latino immigrants by 0.01 to
18.0 percent with the effects being statistically significant in 7 out of 9 models.

23

A number of previous studies that distinguished between county- and city-level
enforcement policies versus state-level policies found that city- or county-level policies has
stronger effects (Amuedo-Dorantes, Arenas-Arroyo & Sevilla, 2016; Watson, 2013). Next, we
investigate, whether health effects of enforcement measures are also more pronounced when the
policy is enforced by only the city/county government compared to a state-wide policy. The
results from this analysis are presented in Table 4 and show that the adverse effect of countylevel JE policy on excellent/very good health was stronger than that of state-level JE policies.
The estimated effects of state policies on other health outcomes were statistically the same as
those of county level policies.
The identifying assumption in the difference-in-difference research design is that timevarying factors correlated with policy have the same effect on the treatment and comparison
groups. We test the validity of this assumption by restricting the analytic samples to treat 1 and
comparison group members living in counties that did not implement 287(g) policies, did not
submit a 287(g) request and did not implement SC before 2011. 23 We assume that a pseudo
policy intervention in 2005 and estimate a difference-in-difference model for each outcome. The
model controls for demographic variables, county-specific time-varying factors, county and year
fixed effects, Tr (treat 1 variable), and the interaction between Tr and the pseudo policy variable
(equals to 1 if the year is 2005 or later, otherwise 0). If our identifying assumption that
unobserved time-varying factors affect the treatment and comparison groups similarly is valid,
the coefficient on the interaction term between Tr and pseudo policy should be close to zero and
statistically insignificant. We repeat this test on two other pseudo policy interventions: a pseudo

23

In 2010, 890 counties have implemented the Secure Communities Program, and by 2011, 1,990 counties have
adopted the Secure Communities Program. We control for Secure Communities policy in our model to account for
policy changes that happen since 2011. We also conduct another set of analyses only examining trends between
2000 and 2010.

24

policy in 2007 and another in 2008. We chose the years 2005, 2007 and 2008 for pseudo policy
intervention because these are the years when increasing numbers of counties adopted
enforcement policies. Results from these analyses, conducted on data for 2000-2012 (the
timeframe of this study) and 2000-2010 (period prior to SC initiative in any of the selected
counties) are presented in Appendix Table A. The coefficient on the interaction term between Tr
and Pseudo policy in all cases is indeed modest and statistically insignificant, providing support
for the validity to our identifying assumption.
In an additional specification, we use U.S. born Hispanics as the comparison group. 24
The disadvantage of using U.S. born Hispanics as comparison is that on account of their
appearance many are likely to be victims of local immigration enforcement. The advantage is
that this group is similar to the treatment groups in that its members are likely to be similarly
affected by many unobserved factors. Results, presented in Appendix Table B, also show that
enforcement policies adversely affected the health and mental health of the treatment group. 25
One additional concern is that the adoption of enforcement policies may be related to the
prevalence of crime. Specifically, localities with higher crime rates may be more likely to request
to for a 287(g) agreement with ICE or may implement Secure Communities earlier, and the high
crime prevalence may have impacts on health and mental health. Previous studies have failed to
find any association between local crime rate and implementation of 287(g) or SC policy (Wong,
2012; Cox & Miles, 2013). However, pre-existing law enforcement culture in counties may be
correlated with the adoption of local enforcement policies; localities where law enforcement is
biased towards minorities may be more likely to pursue 287(g) policy, making it more difficult to
24
We also conducted the same pseudo policy tests reported in Appendix Table A using U.S. born non-Hispanic
black adults or U.S. born Hispanic adults as the comparison group, and results show that these two are valid
comparison groups.
25
It is also worth noting in the first difference models that local immigration enforcement policies did not have
spillover effects on the U.S. born Hispanic population.

25

separate the effect of the local immigration enforcement from other law enforcement policies. To
address these potential sources of bias, we conduct sensitivity analyses using U.S. born nonHispanic black adults as the comparison group, since this group is not directly affected by the
local immigration enforcement policies but is more affected by the local police enforcement
environment. Note that this comparison group is not ideal because U.S. born black adults may be
affected by intensified law enforcement as a result of local immigration enforcement policies.
Estimates are presented in Appendix Table B and suggest immigration enforcement has adverse
effects on the self-rated health of Latino immigrants.
CONCLUSION
We investigate the health and mental health effects of local immigration enforcement
policies, namely Task Force Enforcement (TF) and Jail Enforcement (JE) agreements under
Section 287(g) of IIRAIRA and the Secure Communities (SC) Program, using the restricted-use
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for 2000-2012. Ours is the first study that has used
multiple years of nationally representative data to investigate causal effects of two major local
immigration enforcement policies: Section 287(g) and Secure Communities initiative on health
and mental health of Latino immigrants. Overall, we find evidence that various local
immigration enforcement policies had negative impacts on health and mental health of Latino
immigrant populations.
Specifically, we find that SC increased mental health distress among Latino immigrants
living with non-citizen family members by 2.2 percentage points (14.7 percent), and TF reduced
their mental health distress scores by 15 percent (or 0.08 standard deviation). We also find that
JE increased the risk of Latino immigrants in households with non-citizen members rating their
overall health as fair or poor by 1 percentage points (11.1 percent), and JE lowered their

26

probability of reporting very good or excellent health by 4.8 to 7.0 percentage points (7.8 to 10.9
percent). We administered a series of sensitivity tests and found these estimates to be robust
across various specifications.
Our findings suggest that local enforcement policies had negative health and mental
health effects on Latino immigrants. Arguably, Task Force Enforcement is likely to have a more
adverse effect on the health and mental health of the undocumented than Jail Enforcement or the
Secure Communities initiative. Reports however suggest that communities do not have a very
nuanced response to different local enforcement policies and that they are fearful of any local
enforcement measure (National Immigration Law Center, 2011; National Immigration Project,
2010). Further, we do not have data on whether the respondent was jailed or otherwise directly
came in contact with the local enforcement agencies. Therefore, we believe our results represent
the average effects of policy on those who experienced local enforcement and those who were
fearful of these policies.
Our findings of the effects of local immigration enforcement on health and mental health
of Latino immigrants at the national level are consistent with those of previous state- or locallevel qualitative studies (Rhodes et al., 2015; Hacker et al., 2011; Hardy et al., 2011). Our
contribution is that we use multiple years of national level data and adopt a rigorous
methodology to investigate the causal effects of enforcement policies on the health and mental
health of Latino immigrants. Ours is also the first study to comprehensively examine the effects
of both section 287(g) and Secure Communities initiative. Our findings suggest that by adversely
affecting the health and mental health of Latino immigrants, local immigration enforcement may
eventually increase public healthcare expenditure. 26 This is an unintended consequence that was

The undocumented are eligible for Emergency Medicaid if the undocumented are in a Medicaid-eligible category

mental health effects may adversely impact the economic productivity of Latino families and
their integration with the U.S. society.

Sommers, 2013). Additionally, hospitals in the US are required to provide emergency care regardless of income,
insurance, or citizenship statuses (DuBard & Massing, 2007; Okie, 2007). Arguably, lack of timely care would
increase utilization of Emergency Medicaid by the undocumented and impose a public health burden on the society.

Note: +0.1>p≥0.05, *0.05>p≥0.01, **p<0.01. Each column for each outcome is based on a separate regression. The analysis is restricted to counties with at
least 20 Latino non-citizen observations across survey years. The samples of analyses are adults aged 18-60 years. Treat 1 is foreign-born Hispanic with at
least 1 non-citizen household member, treat 2 is foreign-born Hispanic with only non-citizen household members, and the comparison group is U.S. born NonHispanic white adults. In addition to the coefficients reported above, all models control for age ((omitted category 18-24), 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49,
50-54, 55-60), gender (male), marital status (married), education level (less than 9 years, 9-12 years with no high school degree, (omitted category: high school
degree or GED), some colleges or more, unknown), household size dummy variables (1, 2, (omitted category: 3-4), 5+), log family income, language of
interview (not English), county unemployment rate, county poverty rate, whether the county of residence is in a state has legislations related to undocumented
immigrants (Dream Act, driver’s license, omnibus bills and E-Verify) in year t, and county and year fixed effects. The foreign born samples further control for
years since immigration (0-5, 6-10, 11-15, (omitted category: 15+)), cohort of arrival ((omitted category before 1987), 1987-1991, 1992-1996, 1997-2001,
2002-2012), citizenship status, country/region of origin ((omitted category: Central America), Mexico, South America). In difference-in-difference models, we
further include the interactions of the county-level variables (in italic above) and the treatment status (treat 1 or treat 2). The difference-in-difference estimates
reported above (in the shaded area) are coefficients from the interactions of policy variables with the treatment status variable. Standard errors clustered on
county of residence are in parenthesis.

Note: +0.1>p≥0.05, *0.05>p≥0.01, **p<0.01. Each column in each panel is based on a separate regression. All coefficients are from differencein-difference estimates. See Table 2 for model specifications. The treatment group (treat) is treat 1 in Table 2 (foreign-born Hispanic with at least
1 non-citizen household member) in all models except for (8) and (9), and the comparison group is U.S. born Non-Hispanic white adults in all
models. All samples of analysis are adults aged 18-60 years. The analysis is restricted to counties with at least 20 Latino non-citizen observations
across survey years. In model (1), the treatment sample is further restricted to those arrived to the U.S. before 2002. In model (2), we further
restrict the analysis to counties with at least 50 Latino non-citizen observations across survey years. In model (3), we further restrict the analysis
to counties that were in each year of the NHIS survey between 2000 and 2012. In model (4), we further restrict the analyses to counties that were
in the top 50 percentile county in terms of the proportion of Hispanic population in 2001. In model (5), we further restrict the analysis to counties
that have ever requested for or implemented a Section 287(g) policy (so the 287(g) request is not controlled in this model). In model (6), we do

37

not include the control of “287(g) request” status. In model (7), we further control for the interactions between the Hispanic status (treatment
status) and the year fixed effects to account for trends in the outcome that were unique to the treatment group population. In model (8), the
treatment group is non-citizen adults born in Mexico. In model (9), the treatment group is Latino non-citizen adults. Standard errors clustered on
county of residence are in parenthesis.

panel (1), we exclude states that have ever had state-level 287(g) enforcement policies. In panel (2), we additionally control for two dummy
variables, state-level TF and JE policies (where no county- or city-level policies was implemented), and their interactions with the treatment
status (treat 1). In panel (3), we additionally control for one dummy variable, state-level 287(g) policies (collapsing TF and JE policies; where no
county- or city-level policies was implemented) and its interaction with the treatment status (treat 1).

Note: SC: Secure Communities Program, TF: Task Force Enforcement, and JE: Jail Enforcement. The TF bars and the JE bars include counties that had both TF
and JE agreements, “Both TF & JE” bars separately show the number of counties that had both. Counties began implementing Task Force Enforcement in 2002,
Jail Enforcement in 2005, and Secure Communities Program in 2008. The unit of analysis is county.

Note: +0.1>p≥0.05, *0.05>p≥0.01, **p<0.01. Models in each column and each panel are based on separate regressions using NHIS for 20002012 or 2000-2010, as specified in column sub-headings. The analysis is restricted to counties that have never requested or implemented an
enforcement policy before 2011 (never submitted any 287(g) request, implemented a 287(g) agreement or Secure Communities Program before
2011). In addition, the analysis is restricted to counties with at least 20 Latino non-citizen observations across survey years. The samples of
analyses are treat 1, foreign-born Hispanic with at least 1 non-citizen household member, and the comparison group, U.S. born Non-Hispanic
white adults. All samples are restricted to adults aged 18-60 years. For test 1: Pseudo policy is coded as 1 if the interview year was 2005 and after,
otherwise 0; for test 2: Pseudo policy is coded as 1 if the interview year was 2007 and after, otherwise 0; for test 3: Pseudo policy is coded as 1 if
the interview year was 2008 and after, otherwise 0. All models control for demographic variables [age ((omitted category 18-24), 25-29, 30-34,
35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-60), gender (male), marital status (married), education level (less than 9 years, 9-12 years with no high school
degree, (omitted category: high school degree or GED), some colleges or more, unknown), household size dummy variables (1, 2, (omitted

county poverty rate, whether the county of residence is in a state has legislations related to undocumented immigrants (Secure Communities,
Dream Act, driver’s license, omnibus bills and E-Verify) in year t], treat 1 [years since immigration (0-5, 6-10, 11-15, (omitted category: 15+)),

Note: +0.1>p≥0.05, *0.05>p≥0.01, **p<0.01. Each column for each outcome is based on a separate regression. The analysis is restricted to
counties with at least 20 Latino non-citizen observations across survey years. The samples of analyses are adults aged 18-60 years. Treat 1 is
foreign-born Hispanic with at least 1 non-citizen household member, treat 2 is foreign-born Hispanic with only non-citizen household members,
and the comparison group is U.S. born Non-Hispanic white adults. In addition to the coefficients reported above, all models control for county
and year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered on county of residence are in parenthesis. Shaded areas are results presented in Table 2.
