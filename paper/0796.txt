Introduction

Macroeconomic adjustments to changes in the economic environment are importantly conditioned by the interteniporal choices of economic agents. Pirely
transitory disturbances, for exanple, can have persistent effects when they

cause agents to recalculate plans over an extended planning horizon. For an
open economy linked to a wQrld market, one important aspect of intertemporal
plans is the tthe path of net indebtedness of domestic agents to the rest of the

world. When agents face an intertemporal budget constraint, a decision to alter
current indebtedness implies changes in future consumption possibilities, and so
will be based on expectations of the entire future path of key variables, and

not just today's variables. For this reason, an economy's current account,
which measures changes in national net indebtedness, depends as such on future
economic trends as on the current economic environment.

In the first section of this paper, I present a formal model to show how
today's current account is a function of both current and future economic

variables. A given shift i fiscal policy, for example, will have one effect on
the current account if' it is perceived to be temporary and another if it is seen
to be permanent.

temporary disturbances alter the current

they also affect the future values of consunption, prices and

output, as agents adjust future spending in line with changing indebtedness.
These future changes are often neglected in analyses of the effects of a policy

change. As a side point, it will be clear that "external balance" or a zero
current account position is not, in general, a valid policy target. Household
welfare is improved by the possibility of running current account surpluses and
deficits in response to exogenous shocks.

This paper stresses the determination of the current account under classical

assumptions of market clearing and continuous full employment. Without doubt,
the impact of various disturbances on the current account will be different under

Keynesian, or non—market clearing conditions, But even in the Keynesian case,
the importance of the intertemporaJ. dimension jn current account determination
will remain unchanged.

The Nature of' Current AccQunt Determination

The current account measures the extent of an epononr's net borrowing or
lending vis—a—vis the rest of the world in a given period, and thus is the out-

come of savings and investment decisions. Static models that write the current
account as a fqnction of export and import often blur the intertenporal con-

siderations inherent in savings and investment behavior. I will approach the
current account from the other extreme, modelling it as an outcome of behavior
of far—sighted, intertenporally optimizing households and firms.

The intertemporal choices reflect, of course, the interaction of intertem—

poral hudet constraints and tastes. The budget constraints can be stated two

insightful. From a national perspective, financial

0, the country is a creditor, and when B < 0, it is a debtor. For

simplicity, we suppose that all financial assets are short—term, with instantaneous real yield (in terms of nurneraire commodity) r*, with r* fixed.

One way to impose an intertemporal budget constraint is to posit that in the
long—run, the country is neither a creditor nor debtor in present value terms:

lim e*tB 0

That is, claims or debt vis—a—vis the rest of the world must grow more slowly
than the rate of interest. Imposing this condition on (1) yields immediately:!!

Thus, the discounted value of domestic absorption must equal the sum

production. Note that by transposing G in (2), we have the budget constraint
for household spending;

Here, w(o) is initial household human and financial wealth. If an infinite—
lived household takes (3) as its budget constraint, its consumption possibilities are affected by the present value of government expenditures, but not by

the path of taxes.' For this reason, a "Ricar'ian equivalence proposition"

According to this expression, which is stressed by Krugman [1981] ,

the

discounted value of trade surpluses (Q—C—G) must exactly balance the initial net

indebtedness of the econonr, —B(O). Thade deficits in early years, for
example, must be matched in present value terms by surpluses in later years, if
B(O) =

0.

Policies which increase borrowing in early years imply a fall in

absorption relative to output in later years.
It is convenient

to define the "permanent" or "perpetuity equivalent" of

a

variable X, which we will denote XT'(t), by the relationship:

we can write CA

(Q_QP) — (c—Ce)

In the model that follows, C—Ce resufts from the consumer's intertern—

poral allocation problem. The basic result of the consumer decision is that
consumption is smoothed relative to income, as in the permanent income model.
In the extreme case of smoothing, C E

generally, C—Ce will depend on wealth, the interest rate, and the rate of time

preference. For the utility function presented below, C—Ce = (&_r*)W, so CA =
(Q_QP) + (r*_6)W — (G—G).

Also, in the model below, Q_QP is determined

endogenously, as a function of foreign demand shocks and domestic productivity
shocks.

From this simple expression for CA, we see that at least three phenomena
give rise to current account deficits, all related to household preferences for
certain consumption paths and to the intertemporal budget constraint.
First, when current income is low relative to permanent income, (Q_QP) <

0,

households dissave in order to maintain consumption. Absorption remains higher
than temporarily—depressed income, and a deficit results. Thus, a temporary
decline in world demand for home goods that reduces the terms of trade, or a
temporary decline in domestic productivity that reduces real income tends to

—6—

give rise to trade and current account deficits. Permanent demand or supply
shocks, on the contrary, need not induce a deficit, if both current and per-

manent income are reduced in equal proportion by the shocks. Household consumption drops by the extent of the reduction in (permanent) real income.
Second, a divergence of the rate of return to savings and the rate of time

preference gives rise to external imbalance: (r*_6)W. Even with a flat real
income profile, households may have an incentive to tilt their consumption
streams relative to income streams because of the rewards or costs of postponing
consumption.

Third, when fiscal expenditure is high relative to its permanent level, the

current account will tend to be in deficit, by (G—G). Note that in (6), the
household budget constraint is a negative function of G, but for a given G is
unaffected by the path of G. Thus, farsighted households will adjust consumption downward according to the permanent level of government spending, not the

current level.2/ When G >

G,

total absorption C +

G

will also tend to be above

average, so that a current temporary fiscal expansion will tend to cause trade
deficits now and surpluses in the future.

Later, in the second section, we will see that shifts in investment demand
are a fourth factor in current account determination.

A Formal Model of the Current Account
Now I turn to a model of the current account and dynamic responses to supply

and demand shocks. In general, dynamic models with optimizing agents are not
easily solved analytically, and recourse to simulations is often necessary. Th
facilitate the discussion, then, I focus on a specific model that can be ana—

results.

National Output Q is assumed to be the sum of outputs of two productive
sectors, a pure traded good sector, producing qT, and a semi—tradeable sector,

producing Q3. The pure traded good is in perfectly elastic supply on the world
market, and is taken as numeraire. The semi—tradeable good is exported on the
world market subject to an export demand schedule that is downward sloping in

its relative price u(t). For simplicity, the instantaneous demand schedule is
assumed to be W*(t)/1T(t), where W* is an external and exogenous foreign demand—

shift variable. (The unitary elasticity helps to preserve linearity in the
model.)

Households consume both goods, in amounts cT and C6. The value of total
consumption in traded goods units is c = cT + irc3.

I also assume that 6, the pure rate of time

(i return to this assumption later.)

To get a tractable model it is useful to specialize utility further, by

writing LJ(CT, CS) as log(CT)CSC). This form has a number of helpful
features. First, total expenditure C(t) is linear in household wealth w(t).
This linearity is a property of a class of "intertemporally honothetic" utility

functions, of which log() is a member.1 Second, CR) is divided in constant
expenditure shares on TICS and CT respectively.

When this assumption is maximized subject to (Lt), the optimal consumption

path is governed by the relationships:

Thus, both wealth and consumption expenditure rise according to the divergence
of r* and 6, with households accumulating wealth whenever the rate of return

exceeds the rate of time perference. Expenditures are linear in wealth, as
noted above, with constant of proportionality S. Note that (10) is not a final
form of consumption since W depends on Q (rr QT + nQS), which in turn depends on
{y(t)}, {lr(t)},

etc.

To complete the model, the supply side must be further laid out.

To solve the model, we first find w(o). The trick here is that the value

Equation (14) also holds for all t.
Now from the consumer demand equations, cT and lT(t)CS(t) depend only on

wealth, and not on current values of any variables, with CT(t) = 6W(t) =

and w(o) given in (in).

ir(t)CS(t) is similarly found.

We can summarize current account behavior in two ways. First, CA(O) = Q(0)

(r*_6)W(0) + (1_)[W*(0)_w*P(O)j

Ll-A(i-)J LG(0)-G(0)I + Lii

(o)-i"(o)]

This is the general equilibrium version of the CA equation that was motivated
heuristically in the first section.

It differs from the earlier formula by

allowing for the general equilibrium feedbacks of W* and G on Q. Once again, we
see a time—preference motive in the first RHS term in (15) and a consumption—

smoothing motive in the next three terms. When r* exceeds the rate of time
preference, households accumulate wealth. Next, when world demand is above its
permanent level, or productivity is above its permanent level, then households
also accumulate. Finally, when G exceeds GF', total absorption is temporarily

high and the country runs a deficit. As before- equation (15) holds for any

time

t.

A related way to summarize current account behavior is to measure the cuts—
niulative deficits between 0 and t.

Since CA = B, we have that

To find Bk), we may use the differential equation (i). Thus

Now we substitute 6W for C, and IL + (l—8)nQ5 for Q.

After tedious manipulation,

we end up with the expression:

The cumulative current account deficit between 0 and t is

thus: (i)

to w(o) with a positive dependence if and only if r* > 6; (2) increasing in the
discounted cumulative deviations of A and W from 1F'(0) and W*(O); and (3)

decreasing in the discounted cumulative deviation of G(T) from G(0). Once again,
cumulative deficits depend on the average deviations of actual from permanent
income over the interval.

To some extent, these results depend on specific household utility function

—12—

that we are examining. Obstfeld [1980, l981J among others has recently modelled
the current account under the Uzawa formulation that the households' rate of
time preference varies according to the level of instantaneous utility, with

0.

When this alternative assumption is made, the level of w(o) has

the additional role of influencing the magnitude of '5 along an adjustment path.

A high value of initial wealth w(o), by itself, will tend to induce current
account deficits, by raising 5[u(c(Ufl] relative..to r*.

Finally, let us now turn to some comparative dynamic exercises. Consider
three types of perturbations:

(a) a temporary shock:
x(t) becomes x(t) + 0

an anticipated future shock:
x(t) becomes x(t) 0 <
x(t) + 0

T

T<t

Such shocks to W, 6, or G affect the current account both through the wealth

term in (16), and the consumption—smoothing terms. In general, a temporary rise
in S, or W, or fall in G, will lead to a rise in CA, unless 6 is much greater
than r*. In that case, the positive wealth effect following such a shock leads
households to borrow even more against their now higher wealth, causing deficits

—13—

to rise.!21' A permanent shock that raises wealth improves the current account if

and only if r > 6. An anticipated shock that raises wealth typcially worsens
the current account, and does so necessarily if r* C 6.
Perhaps more interesting are the comparative dynamic effects of various perturbations on ir(t), QT(t), and Q5(t). Here we find explicit expressions for the

long—run effects of temporary disturbances in 0, 6, and W. First, note from
the market equilibrium conditions that:

T according to the effects of these
any temporary shock which reduces

w(o) will lead, after time T, to a lower profile of Q5(t), Tr(t), and a higher
profile of QT(t)

As an example, consider a temporary fiscal expansion. The change in 0F'(0) is
given by:

_jTe_r*tet =

— (l_er*T)O.

C

_1'4

Thus, according to (i), w(O) is given by _r*_1[l_(l_))_1(l_)(l_e_r*T)O.
Since w(t) is given by e(*_tw(O), we have:

Aw(t) = _r*

(18)

Thus, w(t)

is

[1-.a(l_)]_h[l_(l_)X1(1_e_x*T)e*_tO,

for all

t

necessarily reduced. Since G(t) is unchanged for t > T, it is

clear from (18) that the temporary fiscal expansion unambiguously reduces 17(t)

QS(t), and raises QT(t), for t > T. The effects on production and relative prices before time T depend on two offsetting effects. Demand for qS at given IT,
rises by Xe, while household demand falls by a&AW(t). The relative magnitude of
these offsetting effects depends on:

(i) the marginal productivities to consume

QS out of G and C; and (2) the duration of the temporary expansion. If the
expansion is very short (T0), then w(O) is also small, and 17(t) and QS(t) are

positively affected. In the benchmark case r* =

t,

we find that S > 0 and

Mr > 0 for t < T if and only if X > (l_e*T)c.
It is useful to remember how these results differ in the case of no capital

mobility. With a zero current account balance, tC(t) =

0 for t > T, rather than c(t) =

_6e*_5)t&1(0).

This difference again reflects the

fact that with no capital mobility the drop in consumption is the opposite of

As a final exercise, let us examine the current account and resource alloca—

spending. (Remember that in our analysis, announced tax cuts have no effect

Extensions and Conclusions
This paper has illustrated some of the intertenporal aspects of current
account determination, and the role of the current account in macroeconomic

adjustment. Given the difficulties inherent in working with intertemporal optimizing models, the paper relies heavily on a simple framework, and a specific

set of functional forms. The principle that farsighted behavior by householders and firms makes the current account a function of current and future

expected variables is certainly robust to changes in model specification. So too
is the notion that temporary disturbances have long—run effects through their
impact on the optimal intertemporal consumption path of households.

Certain key results do, however, depend on the specific assumptions laid out
in the model.

I have already mentioned how the introduction of a time—varying

discount factor in the utility function can change the likelihood of surpluses

and deficits following shocks to real income. A second type of modification, in
which households have a finite rather than infinite planning horizon, has even

stronger effects on some of our conclusions±'. In this case, government tax

—17—

and debt policy can have important effects on the level of the current account
balance and the path of resource allocation. Government can reallocate welfare

between alternative generations (defined by their planning horizons), raising

the

possibility of an optimal current account policy that maximizes an interge-

nerational social welfare function.

Perhaps the most important deficiency of the simple model is the absence of

investment in physical capital. Shifts in irwstment opportunities over time
give rise to strong current account effects in

theoretical models, and empirical

work seems to confirm the strong, even dominant, role of investment in cross—
country current account behavior (cf. Sachs [198la, 198lb]). Investment is
important because under high capital mobility all domestic

undertaken

investments are

that exceed the world cost of capital, regardless of domestic savings

rates. If new domestic investment opportunities arise that just meet the world
market rate of return, the domestic current account worsens one—for—one with the
rise in investment.
Adding optimal investment plans to an iritertemporal model enormously compli-

cates the algebra, and typically forces a retreat to simulations (cf. Sachs
[1980, 1982j .

The simulation exercises point to the following conclusions.

First, permanent increases in world demand are likely to induce deficits
initially, as the demand increases spur domestic capital formation and hence

foreign capital inflows. Similarly, a fall in world demand can actually result
in surpluses. Second, the resource a.llocational

ces tend

effects of

temporary disturban-

to be magnified when capital accumulation is permitted, since the long—

run supply elasticities of the various sectors are raised by the possibility of
sectoral

capital accumulation.

From this, (2) is immediate.

2 Of course, the government's budget constraint implies that the discounted
value of taxes equals the discounted value of government expenditures net of
initial government claims on the private sector and the rest of the world.

3 See Barro [l9T4] for a discussion of this doctrine. In addition to the
assumption of infinite—lived households, the equivalence proposition requires
that taxes be non—distorting, as is assumed in this model.

(), however, is the constant of proportionality between c(t) and w(t)
invariant to the future path of interest rates. For a useful discussion of
the utility function in current account behavior, see Svennson and Razin

[198U

The PPF can be derived from sectoral production functions of the form:
=

y(t)LT,

Q5 =

(y(t)15)B,

LT +

w(t)dt. Since w(t) = W(O)e

direct substitution that w(o) =

*6)t we find by

w(o)/6.

Aw(o) + consumption smoothing terms. For

the positive wealth effect nay dominate the consumption—smoothing

effect.

See Buiter [1981] for an example of such a model, using the overlapping
generations framework.
