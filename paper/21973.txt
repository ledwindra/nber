ABSTRACT
In a world with limited PAYGO financing possibilities this paper explores whether older Spanish individuals
have the health capacity to work longer. For that purpose we use Milligan-Wise and CutlerMeara-Richards-Shubik simulation methods. Our results suggest that Spanish workers have
significant additional capacities to extend their working careers.

Introduction

There are large concerns about the sustainability of social security systems due to
population aging among developed countries, and Spain is not an exception. Spain has one
of the lowest fertility rates in Europe (below 1.4 according to Eurostat, 2013) while life
expectancy at birth was the highest in 2012 at 82.5 years compared to an average EU-28 of
79.2 (OECD, 2014). In a similar vein, life expectancy at age 65 has been improving over
time; in 1960 men aged 65 expected to live 13.1more years, while the expectations were
18.7 in 2012 (García-Gómez et al 2012 and OECD, 2014). And this trend is expected to
continue in the coming decades (European Commission, 2012).

In parallel, there was a tendency in the 1980s and early 1990s towards reducing
employment participation of older workers (Gruber and Wise, 1999 and 2004; Boldrin et
al, 1999 and 2004). The decreasing trends were reverted in the mid-1990s but
employment participation rates have remained considerably lower than the ones observed
in the late 1970s (see, for example, García-Gómez et al 2012a). There is a large body of
literature that shows that financial incentives have an effect on employment decisions

(Gruber and Wise, 2004) but bad health has also been found to hamper labor force
participation of (older) workers (García-Gómez, 2011; Cervini-Pla and Vall Castelló, 2015).
Therefore, it remains an extremely relevant policy question whether future Social Security
reforms have room to increase the labor market involvement of older individuals, and
whether there is latent work capacity among Spanish older workers.

2

In this paper, we aim to provide a first set of estimates to whether there is health related
unused work capacity among Spanish older workers. We do so following two alternative
methods and focusing on employment as our measure of work capacity. First, we use the
method proposed by Milligan and Wise (2015) and estimate that in 2010 individuals aged
fifty-five to sixty-nine would have worked an additional 7.08 years if they would have
worked as much as individuals with the same mortality rates in 1976. Second, we use
individual level data from the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe and the method
suggested by Cutler et al (2012) to estimate that work capacity increases over 60% once
the normal retirement age of sixty-five kicks in. We are nonetheless cautious with our
conclusions as these results hinge upon somewhat strong assumptions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates trends in labor force
participation and their relation with trends in subjective and objective health measures.
Section 3 simulates gains of work capacity of older workers using the Milligan-Wise
method, while estimates using the Cutler-Meara- Richards-Shubik are presented in section
4. In section 5 we analyze the evolution over time of poor health by education quartiles.
Finally section 6 concludes.

I. Trends in Labor Force Participation and Health
As in many industrialized countries, labor force participation in Spain has changed
substantially in the last decades. We use data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey
(Encuesta de Población Activa, EPA) to illustrate trends in labor force participation since
1977. The EPA is a rotating quarterly survey carried out by the Spanish National Institute

3

that contains detailed information on labor market behavior, education and household
characteristics of approximately 180,000 individuals every quarter. In particular, it asks
every individual about her labor market status the week prior to the interview. We use this
information to estimate average annual participation rates combining data from all
quarters in a given year. Figures 1 plots the evolution of labor force participation for men
and women aged at least fifty-five in Spain since 1977 and Figure 2 shows the evolution of
labor force participation for men and women aged at least sixteen in the same period. We
can see in Figure 1 that there was a steep decline in the labor force participation of men
aged at least fifty-five between 1977 and the mid-1990s; while forty-eight percent of men
aged at least fifty-five were in the labor force in 1977, only twenty-five percent stayed in
the labor force during the 1990s. This declining trend was slightly reversed at the turn of
the century. However, the participation rate was only twenty-eight percent in 2014, which
still represents a much lower value than in 1977. This decrease in labor market
participation since the late 1970’s is substantially explained by the incentives provided by
Social Security institutions (Boldrin et al. 1999). In Spain, legislation promoting early
retirement has had a large effect on the number of early retirees, particularly during the
1970s and 1980s (Boldrin et al. 2001). In addition, the importance of other exit routes for
individuals approaching retirement, such as unemployment or disability insurance, have
also been documented in the literature, particularly for the group of individuals with 55
years or more (Jimenez-Martin and Vall Castelló 2009; García-Gómez et al 2012).
Several competing phenomena can be behind the reversal of this downward trend in
male participation (and especially employment) since the late-1990s. Part of the reversal of
this trend can be attributable to the effects of business cycle conditions, changes in the

4

legislation, increasing levels of education and the increase in the inflow of immigrants,
which have, typically, higher participation rates than native Spanish people (Congregado et
al 2011; Aragon et al. 2009; Cuadrado et al. 2007).1

The evolution of labor market behavior of women is markedly different from that of

men (see Figures 1 and 2). First, labor market participation for women aged at least fiftyfive remained fairly constant between 1977 and 2001 at around 10%. Second, there is a
remarkable increase in the participation rates in the last 15 years, so participation is
currently higher than it was during the late 1970s (Figure 1). The steady increase in the
last fifteen years in labor force participation of older females relate to the overall trend in
labor force participation of women (see Figure 2). Similar to other developed countries,
labor market participation of women has experienced a steady and continuous increase,
from 28% in 1977 to 53% in 2014. We find that trends in labor market participation of
men and women have been converging, although there is still a substantial gap in 2014:
fifty-three percent of women participate in the labor market compared to sixty-six percent
of men. This increase is concentrated among young women, mainly driven by a substitution
of low educated older women by more educated younger generations (Boldrin et al. 2001).
As the increase in female participation rates are mainly driven by cultural changes
regarding the role of women in society, and not by changes in the incentives provided by
the social security schemes, we focus on males in the rest of the paper.
Labor force participation and health of males

1

Immigrants are typically younger than age 55 when they first arrive in the country. In any case, as the
highest immigration inflow in Spain occurred in the late 1990’s some of those immigrants have already
crossed the 55 age threshold.

5

We now turn to revise the evolution of two health measures, mortality and self-assessed
health for Spanish males aged fifty to seventy-five. Several factors have been identified as
determinants of the evolution of population health such as the health care system,
individual behavior and social environment, among others. We use data from the Human
Mortality Database (HMD) and the Spanish National Health Survey (ENS) to analyze the
evolution of both mortality and self-reported health in the last thirty years. ENS is a set of
nationwide cross-sectional surveys that collect information on health, health care use,
lifestyles and socioeconomic characteristics of the Spanish population. Figure 3 plots the
age-profile of self-assessed health and mortality for males in 1987, 1993 and 2006. Selfassessed health is obtained from ENS and shows the percentage that rate their general
health as fair or poor, while mortality rates by age are obtained from HMD. Figure 3 shows
that, as expected, health (measured both by self-assed health and mortality) deteriorates
with age. We also see that the large gains in mortality obtained during the last decades
have been concentrated among the elderly. A reduction in mortality would translate in an
increase in the population able to work if these changes go hand in hand with an
improvement of the health of the population in the working age. The international evidence
is inconclusive regarding whether changes in mortality are translated into a compression
or expansion of morbidity (Klijs et al. 2009). The evidence shown in Figure 3 points out
that also the self-reported health of the older Spanish has improved over time: in 1987,
fifty-one percent of men aged 65 reported having fair to poor health, while this proportion
falls to forty-six percent in 1993 and to forty-one percent in 2006. This improvement in
self-reported health over time is observed specially among men aged fifty-eight to seventy.

6

Summing up, the last decades have witnessed a decrease in older men labor force
participation and, at the same time, an improvement in the general health of men in their
60s. Thus, in what follows, we examine how much older Spanish men could work today if
they experienced the relationship between health and employment of earlier years, i.e.,
what is the unused health capacity to work.

II. Health Capacity to Work using the Milligan-Wise method
We begin our analysis following the methodology first developed by Milligan and
Wise (2015). The aim of this method is to get an estimate of the ability to work at older
ages by comparing the relationship between mortality and employment in some previous
period to the relationship between employment and mortality now. Thus, the idea is to get
the potential employment possibilities of current cohorts if they worked as much as
individuals that exhibited the same mortality rate almost thirty years ago. Once we get this
potential employment (for a given mortality rate) estimate, its difference with respect to
current employment rate constitutes an estimate of the additional work capacity for
current cohorts.
This method implicitly assumes that mortality is a good proxy for health and that the
relationship between health and mortality has remained moderately stable during this
thirty year period. Despite the potential limitations behind these assumptions, we have
chosen to use mortality as our proxy of health (rather than a measure more directly
related to ability to work such as self-assessed health or prevalence of limiting health
problems) for several reasons. First, the use of mortality data allows cross-country
comparison of the estimates, while self-reported measures are subject to reporting bias

7

across countries (Jürges 2007; Milligan and Wise, 2012b). Second, mortality data is yearly
available for a long period of time, while self-assessed health is only available for the years
1987, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2001, 2003 and 2006 (in the National Health Survey, which, in
turn, has a smaller number of observations if we want to have self-assessed health at each
age). Last, although mortality represents a more extreme event in life than changes in selfassessed health, Milligan and Wise (2012b) show that, within countries, improvements in
self-assessed health show a very similar evolution than improvements in mortality.
We use data for mortality from the Human Mortality Database for years 1976 to 2010 and
data for employment from the Labour Force Survey from the National Institute of Statistics
in Spain also for the years 1976 to 2010. We consider only men in our analysis due to the
late incorporation of Spanish women in the labor market, which would make our analysis
much more difficult to interpret.
We plot the relationship between employment and mortality for Spanish men in two
different periods; 1976-1980 and 1991-1995 in Figure 4 and 1976-1980 and 2006-2010 in
Figure 5.2 We can see that for a given mortality rate employment is lower in the two latter
periods compared to the earlier one. For example, the employment rate at 0.7% mortality
rate (first vertical line plotted in the two figures) is 89% in 1976-1980, 77% in 1991-1995
and 71% in 2006-2010, or the large differences observed at higher mortality rates like 2%
(second vertical line plotted in the two figures). Thus, at a 2% mortality rate, the
employment rate in 1976-1980 was around 60%, in 1991-1995 around 10% and in 20062010 around 3%. One of the reasons behind these large differences is that each of these
mortality rates are also reached at later ages. For instance, the 2% mortality rate is reached
2

We pool data for those 5 years for employment and also for mortality and calculate average employment
and average mortality rate at each age.

8

at 63 years old in 1976-1980 but the same mortality rate is achieved at age 65.5 in 19911995 and at age 69 in 2006-2010. As mentioned before, this goes in line with observed
increases in life expectancy.
Therefore, following the Milligan-Wise method, we estimate that, at a 2% mortality rate, if
men in 2006-2010 would have worked as much as men in 1976-1980, the employment rate
in 2006-2010 would have been 57 percentage points higher (observed employment rate is
3%, while employment rate in 1976-1980 was 60%, i.e., a difference of 57 percentage
points). In other words, men in 2006-2010 aged sixty-nine (with a mortality rate of 2%)
would have worked 57 percentage points more than men in 1976-1980 with the same
mortality rate, which they achieved at age sixty-three.
We follow this same logic (but for single years and single ages) to estimate the additional
employment capacity in 2010 using the relationship between employment and mortality
from 1976. The results are shown in Table 1 for men in each age from fifty-five to sixtynine in 2010. In order to calculate the additional employment capacity we proceed as
follows. First, we take the mortality rate for men aged fifty-five in 2010 and go back to the
employment rate of men in 1976 that had the same mortality rate than the fifty-five years
old in 2010. Once we have this (equal-mortality) employment rate we subtract it from the
current employment rate for fifty-five years old in 2010 to estimate the additional work
capacity for men aged fifty-five in 2010. Third column of Table 1 reports the employment
rate in 2010, while the employment rate in 1976 at same mortality rate can be found in the
fourth column. Thus, as can be seen in the last column (first row) of Table 1, men aged fiftyfive in 2010 could have worked an additional 18.8%, which is translated into 0.18
additional years of work on average. If we perform the same estimation for the older

9

individuals included in our sample, we can see that men aged sixty-nine in 2010 could have
worked an additional 0.69 years of work.
If we repeat this calculation for each age from fifty-five to sixty-nine and we sum up all the
additional work capacity, we get a total additional employment capacity of 7.08 years of
work (last column of Table 1). We can compare this number with the average amount of
employment of 5.7 years observed among Spanish male aged fifty-five to sixty-nine in 2010
(see third column of Table 1, last row). Thus, we can observe that, in Spain, the estimated
additional capacity to work is much larger than the current average amount of employment
for men aged fifty-five to sixty-nine. However, notice that the legal normal retirement age
in Spain is 65 years old and most Spanish men do actually retire at this age (or earlier). This
is different in other countries like the USA where it is quite common to work after the
normal retirement age. This fact implies that the estimated additional capacity to work
increases by 20 percentage points from 54.9% at age sixty-four to 73.6% at sixty-five, as
employment drops from almost 30% (at sixty-four) to 9.2% (at sixty-five) and the
mortality rate in 2010 of individuals aged 65 years old (1.32%) is reached at a much lower
age in 1976 with an employment rate as high as 82.8%.
Labor market conditions have gone through important changes during the time
period of analysis (from 1976 to 2010). Therefore, the estimated additional employment
capacity depends to a great extent on the year that we choose as the baseline year. In the
analysis shown in Table 1, 1976 was the baseline year used to calculate the additional work
capacity for individuals in 2010 but, one could perform the same exercise choosing a
different base year. We therefore repeat the exercise using all years from 1976 until 2009
as base year in order to provide a sensitivity measure of the robustness of our results to the

10

specification chosen. Figure 6 plots the cumulate additional employment capacity for men
aged 55 to 69 in 2010 compared to a baseline year that ranges from 1976 to 2009. We see
that the largest estimated value corresponds to the value for the baseline year 1976 (7.08,
as shown in Table 1).
Using mortality as our health measure allows us to make use of very detailed information
over a long time period as well as to compare the results across several countries.
However, it also assumes that the additional years of life can be used to work, which may
not be the case if individuals are not healthy enough to continue working. However, as
Figure 3 shows, self-assessed health has also improved during this period, especially
among individuals aged sixty or older. This result is similar to the evolution of self-assessed
health reported for other countries.
The advantages of using mortality data are larger in countries like Spain in which
longitudinal or large cross-sectional health surveys are not available. The sample size of the
Spanish National Health Survey limits the analysis based on single-ages, and changes in the
questions asked prevent comparison based on other measures of health like limitations in
daily activities. Despite these limitations, we perform similar analysis using two measures
of subjective health to assess the robustness of the previous conclusions to measures that
can better capture work limitations.
Figure 7 plots the relationship between self-assessed health and employment in 1987 and
2006 for individuals aged forty-five to seventy years old while Figure 8 plots the

11

relationship between work limitations3 and employment for the same group of individuals
and years. As before, employment is taken from the Spanish Labour Force Survey. As we
need to calculate both employment rates as well as self-assessed health (and work
limitations) at each age for the two survey years (1987 and 2006) the number of
observations for the health variables at each age can be relatively small and, thus, the
estimates are quite unstable.4 For this reason, we apply a smooth transformation of the two
health variables averaging the level of the current age with the level of the previous and
next age.
We see that the percentage of men that reports their health to be at best fair and the
percentage that reports being limited for work does not change between 1987 and 2006
for those aged forty-five to fifty-five (Figures 7 and 8) However, both health measures
improve in 2006 compared to 1987 for men aged at least fifty-five. Figures 7 and 8 also
illustrate that employment falls sharply at the normal retirement age of sixty-five.
To summarize, using the Milligan-Wise method we estimate an additional capacity
to work of 7.08 years from fifty-five to sixty-nine in 2010 with respect to equal-mortality
values in 1976. This value is larger than the observed employment capacity of 5.7 years for
men aged fifty-five to sixty-nine in 2010. The finding of a bigger estimated additional
capacity to work than the current observed capacity to work is somewhat counterintuitive
and unexpected. However, in the Spanish labor market context, this is mainly explained by

3

More specifically, work limitations corresponds to answering yes to at least one of the following two survey
questions: 1) during the last twelve months did you suffer a disease or illness that limited your principal
activity (work, study, house work, etc..)? 2) During the last two weeks did you have to reduce your principal
activity for at least half a day for any of the simptoms or pains described before?
4 For example, the number of observations varies from 120 (minimum value) for age 70 to 289 (maximum
value) for age 45 in the survey of 1987 and from 113 (minimum value) for age 68 to 235 (maximum value) at
age 45 for the survey of 2006.

12

the strong decrease in employment at the normal retirement age of 65 years old for
Spanish men. For example, in 2010 employment is observed to decrease by 20 percentage
points (from 29.4% to 9.2%) from age 64 to age 65 for men in Spain.

III. Health Capacity to Work using the Cutler, Meara and Richards-Shubik method
We also estimate the capacity to work using information from younger workers in
the same year to estimate the relationship between health and employment as suggested
by Cutler et al. (2012). We first estimate a regression on employment decisions controlling
for a large number of individual and health characteristics of individuals aged 50-54. Then,
we use the estimated coefficients to predict the employment probabilities of older workers
using their current explanatory variables (current health and individual characteristics).
The novelty of this method is to use the estimates from individuals (baseline group) that
are presumably not affected by Social Security benefits as they are years away from the
normal and early retirement age.
We use individual data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe
(SHARE) for waves 1 (2004-2005), wave 2 (2006-2007), wave 4 (2010-2011) and wave 5
(2013). SHARE is a multidisciplinary cross-national panel that contains detailed
information on sociodemographic characteristics, health and labor status, among others,
for a representative sample of the population aged 50 and over in Europe. We pool
information from the four waves mentioned above, and have a sample of 4684 men and
5466 women aged fifty to seventy-four.
We estimate regressions of the following form:
(1)

13

where employment is a dummy equal to 1 if the individual is employed and health is a
comprehensive set of health measures: i) dummy variables for different categories of selfassessed health (excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor); ii) mobility limitations (dummy
variable if the individual has at least one arm function and fine motor limitations); iii)
dummy variable if limited in any activity of daily living (ADLs); iv) dummy variable if
limited in any instrumental activity of daily living (IADLs); v) EUROD mental health index;
vi) dummy variables for different health problems (AMI, stroke, cholesterol, lung disease,
cancer, high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes, osteoporosis, Alzheimer, back pain and
asthma); vii) dummy variables that capture if the individual is underweight, overweight or
obese; and viii) smoking behavior (former or current smoker). Last, we control for
educational attainment and marital status and estimate this equation using linear
probability model. Tables 2a and 2b for men and women respectively provide descriptive
statistics for all the relevant variables for the different age groups, as long with sample
sizes. Table 2c includes a description of the variables displayed in tables 2a and 2b.
Sample size for individuals aged 50-54 (see tables 2a and 2b) may not be large
enough to precisely estimate all the coefficients for the large set of health conditions.
Therefore, we also perform an alternative version of this regression model in which we
create a single health index that combines the information provided by a set of health
variables. We follow Poterba et al. (2013) and construct a health index based on 24 health
questions, including self-reported health diagnoses, functional limitations and other health
indicators. To do so, we first obtain the first principal component of these 24 indicators

14

which is subsequently used to predict percentile scores for each individual.5 Thus, the
index has to be interpreted as higher values implying better health. Poterba et al. (2013)
show that, the health index is strongly related to mortality and future health events such as
stroke and diabetes onset, though not to new cancer diagnoses.
Tables 3a and 3b show the results of estimating equation (1) for individuals aged 50-54
including either a large number of health variables (3a) or the health index (3b). The
results are shown separately for men and women due to the potentially differential effect
of the explanatory variables on employment for men and women. Overall, we find the
expected sign of the association between health and education and the probability of
working for both men and women: more educated individuals and those in better health
are more likely to be employed. However, there are some differences in the magnitude of
the estimates between men and women. For example, the decrease in the employment
probability is larger for men with mobility problems or depression compared to women,
while having a college degree increases the employment probability of women twice that of
men. On the other hand, we find an opposite sign for marital status: being married is
associated with a higher employment probability for men but lower for women. The
estimates using the health index are similar to the ones using the large set of health
variables. In table 3b we can see that higher health is associated with better employment
probabilities. Similarly, the education gradient and the differential association between
marital status and employment are also in line with the findings presented in table 3b.
We use the estimates presented in Tables 3a and 3b to predict employment probabilities
for four age groups (55-59, 60-64, 65-69 and 70-74). Table 4 shows these predictions and
5

Table 3c shows the factor loadings of the first principal component. All loadings are positive so that larger values
of the first principal component represent worse health.

15

actual employment rates. The difference between the predicted and the observed
percentage of individuals working in each group represents the estimated work capacity,
also shown in Table 4. We find that predicted employment decreases with age, but the
decrease is very modest compared to the actual decrease, and this is independent of how
health is included in the model. In fact, even the magnitude of the estimated work capacity
is extremely similar in both cases. Therefore, the rest of the analysis is only shown using
the estimates from the model that controls for health using the health index.
Figures 9 and 10 plot the percentage of men and women working in each age group as well
as the estimated additional capacity to work for each age group and gender. We first note
that both the actual and predicted probabilities of working are lower for women than for
men for all age groups. This is not surprising as we are analyzing individuals over the age of
50 in the 2000’s which correspond to the cohorts of 1960 and before for which women
showed very low labor market participation rates. Furthermore, the actual percentage of
individuals working in the age groups 55-59 and 60-64 remains relatively high (67.7% and
42.6% for men and 41.3% and 22.4% for women). However, when the normal retirement
age kicks in at age 65 the actual percentage of individuals working drops substantially to
6.3% and 0.8% for ages 65-69 and 70-74 for men (3.6% and 0.5% for women). Obviously,
there is no health related shock that affects individuals at age 65 so that the predicted
percentage of individuals working is reduced smoothly over the ages of 60-64, 65-69 and
70-74. Therefore, when individuals reach the normal retirement age their actual
employment decreases sharply while the predicted employment probabilities decrease
relatively slower and, thus, the estimated capacity to work increases substantially from age
65. That is, the additional capacity to work is estimated to be 5.4% (6.6%) for men

16

(women) aged 55-59, 26.3% (20.7%) for ages 60-64, 59.1% (36.1%) for the age group 6569 and 61.5% (35.7%) for ages 70-74.
The work capacity is expected to be different for individuals with different educational
attainment as labor opportunities may differ and a negative association between education
and health has been found across the board. In addition, different health conditions may
hinder employment opportunities differently depending on the educational attainment.
Therefore, we provide estimates of the work capacity by education in two ways: i) use
estimates shown in Tables 3a and 3b to estimate work capacity for men and women (Table
6a for men and 6b for women); ii) estimate separate regressions by education group to
estimate work capacity for men and women (Table 5a for men and 5b for women). We
divide the sample in two groups based on educational attainment depending on whether
they have completed or not secondary education. In general, we see that higher educated
individuals show higher employment rates at each age group and gender but, at the same
time, they also have higher estimated additional employment capacity as their health is
better compared to low educated individuals. However, there is an exception to this rule;
low educated women aged 55-59 have a larger estimated additional capacity to work
than high educated women. This result is probably due to the fact that low educated women
at these ages show very low employment rates although having a relatively good health

status. Figures 11 and 12 plot the results of tables 5a and 5b for men and women,
respectively, for the regressions using all health variables and a single regression for each
educational group.
The Cutler, Meara and Richards-Shubik method (Cutler et. al 2012) allows to estimate the
health capacity to work using a group of contemporaneous individuals, so restricting the

17

assumption that labor market conditions are similar in different points in time as needed in
the Milligan-Wise method (Milligan and Wise, 2015). However, we still need to assume
that individuals aged fifty to fifty-four do not face any disincentive effects from the Social
Security system to stop working. This seems a reasonable assumption for Spain as
beneficial access to disability benefits kicks in at age fifty-five (in which benefits are
increased from 55 to 75% of the regulatory base for partial disability) and early retirement
schemes, which have been reformed over time, do not begin before age sixty. The only
program that could pose a threat to this assumption is the unemployment benefit scheme
which includes an access to (permanent) unemployment subsidies for individuals aged
fifty-two or more until retirement (fifty-five after the last reform in 2013). However, this
program gains in importance as the individual gets closer to the early retirement age
especially after age fifty-five. Additionally, the Cutler et al. (2012) method also includes the
implicit assumption that health affects employment decisions of individuals aged fifty to
fifty-four in a similar way than those older than fifty-five. If older individuals are
systematically concentrated in certain type of jobs for which negative health shocks
represent a stronger limitation to work than younger individuals, then our results would be
upward biased.
IV. Changes in Self-Assessed Health by Education Level Over Time

It is well-established that education is correlated with health and mortality across-theboard (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010). Therefore, trends in self-assessed health and
mortality can be (partly) driven by changes in educational attainment. In addition, jobs

18

opportunities for a given level of education may change over time. In this section, we first
illustrate how the educational attainment of the Spanish population aged fifty has changed
over time, and later illustrate the evolution of self-assessed health using comparable
groups of education.
Figures 13 and 14 show the distribution of education completed by cohort and gender.6
They clearly show that education accumulation has changed dramatically in the Spanish
cohorts that get 50 between the late 60s and the current years. While the older cohorts
have low levels of education (sixty and seventy percent for men and women had only low
education), the younger ones have higher levels of attainment (sixty per cent of men and
seventy percent of women that are 50 in 2011 have high education).

Figures 15 and 16 present the evolution of the fraction having bad health by education
quartile and gender in three periods of time (1987, 2003, and 2006). The fraction having
bad health is defined as the fraction that declares having fair or poor self assessed health.
We find a clear decreasing gradient of the fraction having bad health by education quartile
for both gender. Alternatively, the decreasing gradient over time is much less clear.
Therefore, we find that the improvement in the health status of the population shown
before seems to be driven by changes in the educational attainment of the Spanish
population rather than by changes in the health status of individuals within a given
education quartile.

Low education refers to individuals who did not complete primary education. Medium education refers to
individuals who have primary education completed while high education refers to individuals who have completed
secondary education and above.

19

V. Conclusion
One of the caveats behind any pension reform that extents the normal retirement age is
whether workers are capable of working longer. In this paper we have explored whether
Spanish workers have the health capacity to work longer using two alternative methods.
First, we have estimated what would be the current level of employment if individuals with
a given mortality rate today worked as much as individual with the same mortality rate in
the past. Second, we have used a contemporaneous younger cohort to evaluate the work
capacity assuming that the same health problem hampers employment in the same way for
the two groups of individuals. The conclusions from both analyses are similar: there is a
large employment potential among the population aged fifty-five to sixty-nine. In
particular, using the Milligan-Wise method (Milligan and Wise, 2014), we estimate an
additional capacity to work of 7.08 years from fifty-five to sixty-nine in 2010 with respect
to equal-mortality values in 1976. Similarly, using the Cutler-Meara-Richards-Shubik
method (Cutler et al, 2012), we detect substantial gains that increase both with age
(between 20 and 26 percent for individuals aged sixty to sixty-four and between 36 and 61
percent for individuals aged seventy to seventy-four) and the level of education.
There are several strong assumptions behind the analysis done in this exercise. Therefore,
the results should be taken as an indication that there is potential employment capacity
among the population older than fifty-five in Spain rather than as a conclusive result for
policy purposes. Further research using more detailed employment and health information
is needed before one could drive large policy reforms to increase participation rates at
older ages.
