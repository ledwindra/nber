Managed Care and Provider Volume
Sarah Feldman and David Scharfstein
NBER Working Paper No.
March 1998

ABSTRACT
There is considerable evidence that patients that are treated by high volume physicians and
hospitals have better health outcomes than patients treated by low volume physicians and
hospitals. Thus, as an indirect measure of quality differences between managed care and
traditional fee-for-service insurance, we compare the average provider volume of cancer patients
covered by these two types of plans. We find that managed care patients tend to be treated by
lower volume providers and that the magnitude of the differences vary by the particular cancer
and managed care plan.

1. Introduction
Between 1980 and 1995, the number of individuals covered by managed care plans grew
more than five-fold. With this increase, have come growing concerns about the quality of the care
provided by managed care plans. There have been a number of responses to these concerns: the
establishment of the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) to measure health care
quality and provide accreditation of health plans; the attempt by some health care plans to create
legally enforceable national standards for patient protection; and a presidential advisory committee
on health care quality.
Despite the widespread interest in measuring health care quality, there is still limited
understanding of the differences in the quality of managed care and more traditional fee-forservice (FFS) health plans. Indeed, in their survey of research on the topic, Miller and Luft (1997)
concluded that it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the differences between the two
types of coverage. Of the fifteen studies they reviewed, some found evidence that managed care
plans offer higher quality care than FFS plans; others found just the opposite; and still others
found little difference between the two types of health plans.
Research on quality takes two approaches. In one approach, researchers examine the
process of health care, comparing the ways in which health care providers treat disease.1 In the
second approach, researchers compare patients’ health outcomes.
For example, Sheldon Rechtin and co-authors (1990, 1991a,b), taking the process
approach to study the medical management of colorectal cancer, diabetes, and congestive heart
failure, found no meaningful differences in the way patients in managed care plans are treated

The NCQA takes the process approach, collecting information, for example, on whether health plans screen for
breast and cervical cancer, advise smokers to quit smoking, and prescribe appropriate medication for heart disease.

compared to patients in fee-for-service plans. In a more recent study, however, Rechtin et. al.
(1997) found that stroke patients covered by managed care plans were less likely to be discharged
to a rehabilitation center, suggesting that they received less comprehensive (and perhaps lower
quality) therapy.
An example of the outcomes approach is Rechtin et. al. (1992) which found no differences
in the health status of elderly patients under the two types of coverage. Similarly, Yelin et. al.
(1996) found no outcome difference for patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. By contrast,
Ware et. al. (1996) did find differences between managed care and FFS plans. They found that,
over a four-year period, chronically ill non-elderly patients fared better in managed care plans,
while chronically ill elderly and poor patients fared better in the FFS plans. Exactly why they
observed different patterns depending on age and income remains an open question.
There are a number of studies that combine the process and outcomes approaches to
measure quality. Young and Cohen (1991) found that managed care patients were less likely to
receive coronary artery bypass graft and arteriography following AMI, but there were no
statistically significant differences in post-AMI mortality.

Similarly, Cutler, McClellan, and

Newhouse (1997) found lower resource utilization in managed care plans, but no difference in
AMI mortality rates. Carlisle et. al. (1992) took a similar approach although with a more in-depth
analysis of the process of medical care for AMI patients. They found higher quality processes in
managed care plans and lower AMI mortality rates.2
In this paper, we take a different approach. In particular, we compare the hospitals and

2

One limitation of this study, however, is that it covers only three HMOs. The three are among the most successful
HMOs in the United States, whereas the patients in the FFS plans were drawn from a broader sample reflecting
hospitals and health care providers of average quality. It is an open question whether one would continue to see
differences in performance if one compared the FFS patients to patients in a broader cross-section of HMOs.

physicians that treat managed care patients and FFS patients. The starting point for our analysis is
the large literature establishing that patients have better clinical outcomes when they are treated
by physicians and hospitals with more experience treating the disease. For example, it has been
shown that the patients of surgeons and hospitals that perform a larger number of coronary artery
bypass grafts (CABGs) are less likely to die during or shortly after the procedure.

The

relationship between physician and hospital volume and outcomes has also been established for a
wide range of surgical procedures and some medical treatments of chronic illness including:
orthopedic surgery, angioplasty, organ transplantation, colorectal and breast cancer surgery,
hysterectomy, and AIDS.
The precise mechanism that links volume and outcome is unknown. It could be that
experience makes physicians and hospitals better, i.e. there is some sort of learning-by-doing.3 Or,
it could be that higher volume hospitals and physicians attract more patients because they are
correctly perceived by patients to be better. For our purposes, the exact cause of the relationship
between volume and outcome is less important than the fact that such a relationship exists.
Thus, our empirical goal is simply to examine whether patients in managed care plans tend
to be treated by higher or lower volume physicians and hospitals. We analyze this question using
data on all hospital discharges in Massachusetts in 1995. These data identify the physicians and
hospitals providing the care, as well as the patient’s insurance plan (e.g., Harvard Community
Health Plan, HMO Blue, Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Medicare etc.) The dataset also provides fairly
detailed clinical information --- patient diagnoses and procedures performed --- as well as some
demographic information on the patients.

3

Laffel et. al. (1992) suggests that learning by doing is part of the explanation. They examined the performance of
physicians and hospitals as they became more experienced performing heart transplantation

4

We examine the relationship between managed care and volume for surgeries related to
three types of cancer: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and gynecologic cancer. We chose these
particular diseases because they are almost always treated surgically, and thus there is unlikely to
be major differences in the way managed care and FFS plans treat their patients. We find that, on
average, and after controlling for demographic differences, patients with breast cancer who are
covered by managed care plans are operated on by physicians who performed 22% fewer
procedures than the physicians of FFS patients. Managed care patients with gynecologic cancers
are operated on by physicians who perform 25% fewer surgeries.

There is no appreciable

difference between managed care and FFS plans in the volume of the physicians operating on
patients with colorectal cancer.
These averages mask considerable heterogeneity across plans. Some managed care plans,
use considerably lower volume physicians than the average. For example, one of the plans used
physicians performing 43% fewer breast surgeries and 68% fewer hysterectomies. By contrast,
patients in another plan were treated by physicians who were slightly less experienced than the
physicians of FFS patients, and the difference was statistically insignificant.
We also find that managed care patients tend to be treated at hospitals that perform fewer
procedures. For example, in the case of breast cancer surgery, patients in five of the six largest
plans are treated at significantly lower volume hospitals --- hospitals with volume 35% below the
average of FFS patients’ hospitals. One finds similar results for colorectal cancer surgery, and
statistically insignificant differences for gynecologic cancer surgery.

However, one of the

managed care plans sends patients to hospitals with 23% - 41% higher volume than the hospitals
of FFS patients (depending on the procedure).
If one accepts the view that volume and quality are related, then these results indicate that,

5

in many cases, managed care plans offer lower quality care than FFS plans. The results also
indicate that not all managed care plans are alike --- not surprisingly, some are better than others.
Moreover, even the same managed care plans can offer different quality care for different
diseases.
In the next section of the paper, we discuss the data used in this study and describe our
empirical approach. Section 3 presents the basic empirical results. We discuss the implications of
the results and suggest future research opportunities in Section 4.

2. Data and Empirical Approach
We use the 1995 Hospital Case Mix and Charge Data compiled by the Division of Health
Care Finance and Policy of the Massachusetts Office of Health and Human Services. Like most
states, Massachusetts requires hospitals to report detailed clinical and financial information on all
hospital stays. However, Massachusetts is one of the few states that includes (encrypted)
physician identifiers in the dataset and identifies the health care plan by name and type.4 We use
1995 data because it is the first full year with physician identifiers, and the 1996 data were not
available when we began this study.
While, in principle, one could analyze all hospital admissions, we chose not to do so. The
reason is that hospital admissions and surgeries may differ in the extent to which they are
discretionary. For example, prostate cancer can be treated with surgery or by outpatient radiation
therapy. Because we did not want our analysis to be confounded by the possibility that managed
care plans and fee-for-service plans differ in the extent to which they treat patients on an inpatient

4

Other states may indicate the type of health care coverage, but not the actual name of the health plan.

6

or outpatient basis, we chose to focus on diagnoses and treatments where there is little discretion
as to whether to perform inpatient surgery.

While there are possibly many such diagnoses and

treatments, we focus on the following three:
1. Breast Cancer treated with mastectomy or lumpectomy.5
2. Gynecologic Cancer (ovarian, uterine, cervical) treated with hysterectomy (total
abdominal or radical).6
3. Colorectal Cancer treated with resection of colon or rectum.7
For each of these procedures there is evidence that the patients of high volume providers
have better outcomes. As a measure of experience with one of the procedures, for each physician
we calculate the total number of such procedures the physician performed during the year. This
number includes procedures that were performed for diagnoses other than cancer, e.g.
hysterectomy for non-malignant uterine fibroids.8 Of course, this measure --- which we refer to as
physician volume --- is only an imperfect proxy for the physician’s experience with the procedure,
and an even more imperfect proxy for the physician’s skill with the procedure. Unfortunately, we
were unable to get further information on physicians such as years of practice, board certification,
and sub-specialty training.

The analogous measure of a hospital’s experience with one of the

procedures is the total number of the procedures performed at the hospital for the relevant

5

Breast cancer is defined here as ICD9 hospital codes 1740-1749 inclusive. The surgical procedures are ICD9
hospital codes 8521-8523, 8541, 8543.
6

Gynecologic cancer is defined here as ICD9 hospital codes 179, 1800-1839 inclusive; total abdominal hysterectomy
is ICD9 code 6840 and radical abdominal hysterectomy is ICD9 code 6860.
7

Colorectal cancer is defined here as ICD9 hospital diagnoses codes 1530-1541 inclusive; the procedures are ICD9
hospital procedure codes 4573-4576 inclusive and 4863.
8

An alternative measure of physician experience with the procedure could include only the procedures performed
to treat the cancer diagnoses. Although we do not report the results, the basic conclusions are unaffected by this
alternative definition of physician experience.

7

diagnoses, which we refer to as hospital volume.
Our focus is on the relationship between the patient’s health plan and the experience of the
physicians treating the patient. There are several different categories of health plans recorded in
the Case Mix data. Two are Medicaid and Free Care (a state-run program for the otherwise
uninsured), which we exclude from the analysis because the indigent populations they serve are
likely to be quite different from the population with private insurance and Medicare. There are
four managed-care plan categories: health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider
organizations (PPOs), commercial managed care, and Medicare managed care. Because the
differences among HMOs, PPOs, and commercial managed care are unclear --- at least in the way
it is coded in the data --- we make no distinction among these types of plans.
In 1995, the managed care plans in Massachusetts with the largest number of hospital
admissions were:
(1) HMO Blue (a managed care plan offered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield) with 35,949
admissions;
(2) Harvard Community Health Plan (HCHP) with 30,621 admissions;
(3) Tufts Associated Health Plan with 24,584 admissions;
(4) Pilgrim Health Care (since merged with HCHP) with 20,379 admissions;
(5) Fallon with 11,488 admissions;
(6) Bay State Health Care (another Blue Cross/Blue Shield managed care plan) with 9997
admissions.
In our analysis, we will break out the results for these large managed care plans, and group all
other managed care plans together. Because of the preliminary nature of our results, we will not
identify these plans by name when we present the specific results.

8

There are also a number of different types of fee-for-service plans.

The largest is

Medicare with 287,285 hospital admissions, and the largest private plan is Blue Cross/Blue Shield
Indemnity with 40,269 admissions. There are also 31 commercial plans identified by name, the
largest of which is John Hancock Life Insurance, with 4211 hospital admissions. In our analysis
we separate out the results for Medicare fee-for-service, and we group BC/BS together with all
commercial FFS plans.
In addition to the type of health insurance, there are other factors that can have an effect
on physician and hospital choice. In particular, proximity to high volume hospitals should increase
the likelihood that patients are treated by high volume providers. As a measure of proximity we
use the shortest distance from the zip code of the patient’s residence to the ten highest volume
hospitals for the procedure.9 Income may also have an effect on provider choice since higher
income patients are likely to be more educated health care consumers. Although we do not have
patient income data, we do have information on median income in the patient’s zip code of
residence. Age and race may also affect provider choice.
In the patient-level regression analysis for each procedure, we examine whether managed
care patients are treated by higher or lower volume providers than are FFS patients, controlling
for patient demographic characteristics. Thus, the regressions take the following form:

Provider Volumei = α0 + Σj aj InsurancePlanij+ β1 ln(Agei) + β2 ln(Incomei) +
Σk β3k Race Dummiesi + β4 ln(Distancei) + ει,

9

One could also calculate distance to high volume physicians, but it is highly correlated with distance to high
volume hospitals.

9

where Provider Volume refers to the number of procedures performed by the provider (hospital
or physician) during the year and i indexes patients.
Before presenting the results of the regression analysis, it is worth reviewing the
characteristics of the sample. Table 1 provides summary statistics for each of the three cancer
surgeries. The mean physician volumes for breast cancer surgery, colorectal cancer surgery, and
gynecologic cancer surgery are 15.6, 18.4, and 21.0, respectively.

There is substantial

heterogeniety in the physician volumes for each of these procedures. For example, the standard
deviation of physician volume for breast cancer surgery is 14.5, almost as large as the mean. The
physician in the lowest 25th percentile performs 6 surgeries, while the physician in the 75th
percentile performs 20.
These numbers count physicians each time they perform surgery, thus oversampling the
high volume physicians and understating the number of low volume physicians. For example, of
the 400 physicians performing at least one breast cancer surgery in the sample, 25% performed 3
or fewer, 75% performed 9 or fewer, and only 7.5% (30 physicians) performed 20 or more. For
gynecologic cancer, the median physician performed only one hysterectomy, and there were only
14 out of 313 (4.5%) who performed 20 or more. For colon cancer, 451 physicians performed at
least one surgery for the disease, the median performed 9 surgeries, and 58 (12.91%) performed
20 or more surgeries.
Table 1 shows that mean hospital volume is 91.9 for breast cancer surgery, 119.2 for
colon cancer surgery, and 65.1 for gynecologic cancer surgery.

Here too the variation across

providers is very large. Of the 76 hospitals performing at least one surgery for breast cancer, 25%
performed fewer than 15, 75% performed fewer than 52, and there were only 6 that performed
more than 100 surgeries during the year.

The volume numbers are even lower for gynecologic

10

cancer: of the 66 hospitals operating on women with gynecologic cancer, 25% performed fewer
than 4 such procedures, 75% performed fewer than 17, 7 performed more than 60 procedures,
and only 3 performed more than 100. In the case of colorectal cancer, the hospital volume
numbers are considerable higher. Of the 73 hospitals, 25% performed fewer than 29, 50%
performed fewer than 65, and 75% performed fewer than 100. There are 19 hospitals that
perform 100 or more surgeries for colon cancer.
In addition to summary statistics on some of the demographic variables, Table 1 provides
information on patients’ insurance. Given that cancer tends to be concentrated among the elderly,
it is not surprising that most of the patients (51% to 78% depending on the cancer) have
Medicare insurance. However, only a small fraction of these Medicare patients (3% to 4%) are
covered by managed care. The non-Medicare patients are covered by private managed care plans
or fee-for-service plans. Depending on the procedure, between 60% and 65% of these privately
insured patients are covered by managed care plans.

3. Empirical Results
A. Physician Volume
For each of the three surgeries, Table 2 lists the mean physician volumes for: (1) all
private fee-for-service plans; (2) the six largest private (non-Medicare, non-Medicaid) managed
care plans; (3) all other private managed care plans grouped together; (4) standard Medicare feefor-service; and (5) Medicare managed care plans grouped together.
In all three cases, the mean physician volume of private FFS patients exceeds that of
private managed care patients. We discuss the results for each of the three surgeries in turn.
Breast Cancer Surgery. The mean physician volume for private FFS plans is 20.8,

11

compared to 6.4 for private managed care patients, i.e. FFS is 27% higher than managed care.
For all of the large managed care plans except Plan A, the differential is statistically significant. In
the case of Plan B and Plan F, the difference in physician volume is very large; physicians that
treat private FFS patients perform 60% more surgeries than the physicians treating Plan B and
Plan F patients (i.e. 20.5 vs. 13.0 for Plans B and F).
Physicians treating patients covered by Medicare --- both FFS and managed care --perform fewer surgeries than the physicians treating private FFS patients. The differences are
large: the physician volume of private FFS patients is 49% higher than the physician volume of
Medicare FFS patients (14.0) and 40% higher than the physician volume of Medicare managed
care patients (14.9).
Table 3 indicates the predicted physician volumes for the various health care plans using
the regression model described in Section 2 above. The predicted values are based on the means
of the demographic variables --- age, income, distance to large hospitals, and race. The table
indicates that there continue to be statistically significant differences in physician volumes between
private managed care and FFS plans and that the magnitude of the differences is not changed
much. The difference between Medicare and private FFS is reduced and is no longer statistically
significant.
Colorectal Cancer Surgery. The mean volume of physicians treating private FFS patients
with colorectal cancer is 18.0 as compared to 17.3 for private managed care patients. The overall
difference is not statistically significant and only one of the seven private managed care plans, Plan
A, exhibits a statistically significant difference in physician volume as compared to FFS plans.
The regression analysis which controls for demographic variables, does not change this
conclusion.

The mean physician volume of Medicare FFS patients is slightly higher (but

12

insignificantly so) than FFS patients, while the mean physician volume of Medicare managed care
patients is significantly higher than that of private FFS patients. In Table 3, once demographic
controls are included, the difference between Medicare FFS and private FFS becomes statistically
significant and the difference between Medicare managed care and private FFS remains
statistically significant.
Gynecologic Cancer Surgery.

The average number of procedures performed by

physicians treating private FFS patients for gynecologic cancer is 23.9 as compared to 18.3 for
physicians treating patients in private managed care plans. Physicians used by patients in four of
the six largest managed care plans have statistically significant lower volume than physicians used
by FFS patients. The magnitude of the differences are very large. In the case of Plan F, the
average physician volume is only 62% lower than the average volume of private FFS plans (9.2
vs. 23.9). Physician volume in Medicare managed care plans (8.4 surgeries per year) is also
significantly lower than physician volume in private FFS plans and Medicare FFS plans (22.0
surgeries per year). The differences continue to hold once demographic controls are included, as
Table 3 shows.

B. Hospital Volume
Tables 4 and 5 indicate that managed care and FFS patients are treated at hospitals with
significant differences in the number of procedures they perform. Table 4 gives the raw means for
the various plans, while Table 5 adjusts the means for demographic factors.
Breast Cancer Surgery. The average private FFS patient is treated at a hospital that
performs 120.9 surgeries per year, while the average managed care patient is treated at a hospital
that performs 99.8 surgeries per year. However, patients in one of the managed care plans, Plan

13

A, are treated by hospitals with significantly higher volume than the patients covered by private
FFS plans --- 171.1 for Plan A vs. 120.9 for the private FFS plans. As will be discussed shortly,
this differential for Plan A is true of the other procedures as well. Interestingly though, while Plan
A patients are treated at higher volume hospitals than private FFS patients, Table 2 indicates that
they are not treated by higher volume physicians. In fact, patients covered by Plan A are treated
by relatively low volume physicians at high volume hospitals.
The patients covered by the other managed care plans are treated at significantly lower
volume hospitals --- from 23% lower in the case of Plan C to as much as 56% lower in the case of
Plan F. On average, patients in Plans B-F are treated at hospitals with volumes of 79.2, 34%
below the average for FFS patients.
Finally, patients covered by both types of Medicare plans --- FFS and managed care --- are
treated at lower volume hospitals.
Table 5 presents the means once they are adjusted for demographic differences and there
is no appreciable difference in the results. Plan A patients are treated at higher volume hospitals
than FFS patients, and patients in PlansB-F ate treated at hospitals with 35% lower volume.
Colon Cancer Surgery. The same pattern exists for colon cancer surgery, although the
magnitude of the differences are somewhat smaller. On average, patients in private FFS plans are
treated at hospitals with a volume of 134.7 colorectal surgeries, while it is 121.2 for private
managed care plans. Here too, Plan A patients are treated at higher volume hospitals than FFS
patients. As Table 2 shows, they are treated by low volume physicians at these high volume
hospitals. Patients in all other managed care plans are treated at lower volume hospitals than
patients in private FFS plans. On average, they are treated at hospitals with a volume of 110.2 as
compared to 134.7 for FFS patients, an 18% differential.

14

The same pattern of results carry over to Table 5 where demographic controls are
included. Plan A patients are treated at higher volume hospitals and patients in Plans B-F are
treated at hospitals that perform an average of 22% fewer surgeries than the hospitals of FFS
patients.
Gynecologic Cancer Surgery. The difference between private FFS and private managed
care plans are somewhat less pronounced for gynecologic cancer surgery. The overall mean for
private FFS patients is 67.1, while it is 63.4 for private managed care patients. Plan A patients
are treated at relatively high volume hospitals, those with an average volume of 90.8. Patients in
the other plans are treated at hospitals with lower volume, but the only plan where the difference
is statistically significant is Plan B with an average volume of 33.0 as compared to 67.1 for private
FFS patients. Inclusion of demographic controls does not alter this basic conclusion.

C. Effect of Demographic Variables
Panels A and B of Table 6 provide information on the effect of demographic variables on
the choice of physician and hospital. The effects are estimated from the regression analysis
described in Section 2 and are evaluated at the means of all the other variables in the regression.
The tables indicate that higher income patients --- or more precisely, patients living
in higher income zip codes --- are more prone to go to higher volume physicians (Panel A) and
higher volume hospitals (Panel B). For all the procedures, the effect of income on volume is
highly statistically significant. In the case of breast cancer surgery, patients with income one
standard deviation above the mean are treated by physicians with 22% higher volume than the
physicians of patients with income one standard deviation below the mean (16.9 procedures vs.
13.8). The higher income breast cancer patients are treated at hospitals with 28% higher volume

15

than the hospitals that treat lower income patients (103.3 vs. 80.5).
The effect of income on physician and hospital volume are somewhat smaller for
colorectal cancer surgery; higher income patients are treated by physicians that perform 11%
more surgeries and than the physicians of lower income patients (17.9 vs. 16.1) and at hospitals
that perform 17% more surgeries (128.4 vs. 110.0).10 Finally, the effect of income on physician
volume is quite large in the case of gynecological cancer surgery, with higher income patients
being treated by physicians that perform 47% more surgeries than the physicians of lower income
patients (25.0 vs. 17.0).

The effect of income on hospital volume for this procedure is smaller;

higher income patients are treated at hospitals with only 11% higher volume than the hospitals of
lower income patients (69.5 vs. 60.7).
These results are consistent with the findings of McClellan and Skinner (1997) that higher
income Medicare patients use more Medicare services, mostly physician and outpatient services.
This suggests that higher income patients are more aggressive in seeking high quality health care.
Thus, it is not surprising that they tend to seek care from higher volume physicians and hospitals.
Age also has an effect on provider choice; older patients tend to be treated by lower
volume physicians and hospitals. For example, the average 84 year old with breast cancer (one
standard deviation above the mean) is treated by physicians who performed 12.9 breast cancer
surgeries during the year, while the average 61 year old with breast cancer (one standard
deviation below the mean) was treated by a physician who performed 17.8 (38% more) breast
cancer surgeries. The average 84 year old is treated at hospitals that perform 81.3 breast cancer
surgeries, while the average 61 year old is treated at hospitals that perform 102.5 surgeries.

10

One could also calculate distance to high volume physicians, but it is highly correlated with distance to high
volume hospitals.

16

There are similar effects of age for the other procedures, though the magnitudes of the effects are
smaller. It is not completely clear how to interpret the results on age. One possible interpretation
is that it is more difficult for elderly patients to find high volume physicians or travel to high
volume hospitals.
Table 6 presents inconclusive evidence on the effects of race on provider choice. White
patients tend to be treated by higher volume physicians than African-American patients for
colorectal cancer, but the opposite is true for gynecologic cancer, and there is no significant
difference for breast cancer.

African-American women are treated for breast cancer at

significantly higher volume hospitals than white women, but there are no significant effects of race
for colorectal cancer and gynecologic cancer.
Finally, Table 6 presents evidence that proximity to high volume hospitals increases the
likelihood that patients will be treated at higher volume hospitals. The effect is relatively small for
breast cancer and gynecologic cancer and larger for colorectal cancer. Hospital proximity has no
effect on physician choice for breast cancer and gynecologic cancer, but does have an effect for
colorectal cancer.
4. Discussion and Conclusion
The results of this paper indicate that patients covered by managed care plans tend to be
treated by lower volume physicians and at lower volume hospitals than patients covered by FFS
plans. Although this is the overall pattern, there is quite a bit of variation across health plans. The
patients in one plan (Plan B) were treated by physicians who performed many fewer surgeries than
physicians treating FFS patients, while there was little difference in physician volume for another
plan (Plan C). One of the health plans (Plan A) treated their patients at considerably higher
volume hospitals than FFS patients, but Plan B patients were treated at hospitals with

17

considerably lower volume. If volume is a valid indicator of quality, it suggests that there is
substantial variation in health-care quality across managed care plans.
Our results, at first glance, seem difficult to reconcile with the literature on managed care
quality, which find little systematic differences in the health outcomes of managed care and FFS
patients. If our results are valid --- i.e., there are quality differences between the two types of
coverage as a result of provider-volume differences --- why don’t we see these differences in the
health outcomes of managed care and FFS patients? There are two possible answers. One is that
the literature investigating quality differentials tends to focus on outcomes of chronic diseases that
are generally managed through medical, rather than surgical, intervention. The quality of medical
intervention may be harder to measure than the quality of the kinds of surgical interventions we
are studying. The second answer may be that existing studies compare quality of FFS plans and
the average managed care plan. As our study indicates, however, looking at averages may mask
considerable heterogeneity across plans. Some managed care plans may be better than FFS plans,
other may be worse. Ultimately, to reconcile our results with the literature it would be useful to
more directly measure the health outcomes of patients in our sample.
One question that we have not addressed is exactly why it is that managed care patients
tend to be treated by low volume providers. One possibility is that managed care plans limit
patients to using relatively low volume providers. They might not be referred to specialists for
their procedures, or their access to high-volume specialists may be restricted.

In addition,

managed care health plans may not send their patients to high-volume tertiary care, teaching
hospitals because they only have contracts with low-volume community hospitals.

This

interpretation is plausible because lower cost community hospitals and low-volume surgeons are
likely to offer their services at more attractive rates to managed-care health plans. To determine

whether this is indeed the explanation one could collect information on the hospitals and providers
with whom the managed care plans have contracts.
An alternative interpretation of the findings is that managed care plans do not restrict
patient choice, but rather that individuals who enroll in managed care plans are less aggressive
health care consumers. In this interpretation, even if they had enrolled in a FFS plan, they would
choose to be treated by low volume providers because they care less about the quality of their
care. This leaves open the question of why managed care plans don’t direct these patients to high
volume providers who offer higher quality care. We suspect the answer again is that high volume
providers are more expensive.
This discussion raises the related question of why some managed care plans use high
volume providers and others do not. Ultimately, the negotiated prices between health care
providers and insurers will depend on provider costs and the bargaining power of the two parties.
It is likely that size gives providers and insurers bargaining power. Thus, one would expect the
patients of larger insurance plans --- those with more bargaining power vis a vis the hospitals --to be treated by higher volume providers that the patients of smaller insurance plans. This
implcation is easy to analyze with our data. In addition, one could examine whether mergers
between health plans --- such as that between Harvard Community Health Plan and Pilgrim --affected the volume of the providers treating patients in these plans.
Another way to address this question is to analyze data from other states where managed
care penetration levels differ. For example, in southern states where there is relatively little
managed care penetration, high volume physicians and hospitals are in better positions to turn
away low-priced managed care contracts. As a result, one might expect to see bigger differences
in the volume of physicians and hospitals treating managed care and fee-for-service patients in

19

these states. By contrast, in California, the state with the largest managed care penetration, there
may be little difference between managed care and fee-for-service plans, because all hospitals and
physicians are reliant on managed care business. With a long enough time series one could also
examine how changes over time in managed care penetration affect the allocation of patients
across low volume and high volume providers.
Finally, in order to draw more general conclusions about provider volume differences
between managed care and FFS, one would have to analyze more procedures. Our preliminary
analysis of other procedures --- including those that are more elective in nature --- indicates that
the sort of effects we have identified are prevalent, at least in Massachusetts in 1995.

Sample Summary Statistics
The table below records means of some of the variables in the dataset broken out by breast cancer surgery,
colorectal cancer surgery, and gynecological cancer surgery. (See footnotes 5-7 for more precise definitions of the
diseases and surgeries.) The number in brackets is the median of the variable, and the number in parentheses is
the standard deviation. Physician volume is the number of procedures performed by the physicians including those
that were not performed for a cancer diagnosis. The sample includes only those patients covered by private
insurance and Medicare, thus eliminating patients covered by Medicaid, Free Care, other government programs,
and patients paying themselves.
