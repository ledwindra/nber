Are Big-Time Sports a Threat to Student Achievement?

NBER Working Paper No. 17677
December 2011
JEL No. H0,I23,J16
ABSTRACT
We consider the relationship between collegiate-football success and non-athlete student performance.
We find that the team's success significantly reduces male grades relative to female grades. This phenomenon
is only present in fall quarters, which coincides with the football season. Using survey data, we find
that males are more likely than females to increase alcohol consumption, decrease studying, and increase
partying in response to the success of the team. Yet, females also report that their behavior is affected
by athletic success, suggesting that their performance is likely impaired but that this effect is masked
by the practice of grade curving.

“Tailgaiting rituals, painted faces, and screaming fans are part of American higher
education as surely as physics labs and seminars on Milton. . . Big-time athletics
is too important to be relegated entirely to the sports pages. . . At issue is whether
the university entertainment enterprise is a threat to American higher education
or instead is one of its reasons for success.”

Introduction

In 2010, 211 out of 218 Division I athletics departments at universities subject to open
records laws received a subsidy.1 These subsidies are substantial and rapidly growing. From
2006 to 2010, the average subsidy increased 25-percent, to nine-million dollars. Given the
large amount of tax-payer and tuition dollars that are being channeled toward college sports
programs, combined with concerns that these programs might be detrimental to the academic
missions of universities, the merits of this spending has been the subject of intense debate.
However, almost nothing is known about its effect on human capital acquisition.2 The
research that has been conducted on big-time college sports has focused primarily on its
advertising effects, considering impacts on student applications, student enrollment, and
alumni giving.3 To our knowledge, Clotfelter (2011) is the only prior study to plausibly
identify a causal effect of college sports on learning and research, which are clearly the
most important objectives of post-secondary institutions.4 It is important to note that it
1
There are a total of 346 Division I schools, 128 of which are not subject to open records laws. Division
I is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics. Relative to other schools in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA), Division I schools are required to field more sports teams and are allowed to offer offer
financial aid to more athletes. Statistics are based on the analysis of documents gathered by USA Today
and Indiana University’s National Sports Journalism Center. These data were available on 10 October 2011
at www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2011-06-23-2011-athletic-department-subsidy-table n.htm.

In describing the close-to-twenty years he convened the National Bureau of Economic Research working
group on higher education, Clotfelter (2011) reports: “In the 30 meetings of that group that occurred over
this period, scholars presented 176 papers on topics ranging from financial aid, rising costs, and preferential
admissions to faculty retirement, doctoral training, and sponsored research. But only one paper during this
entire period had to do with big-time college sports.”

is not clear ex ante what effect to anticipate, as some have argued that college sports are
a distraction that diverts time and attention away from academic pursuits whereas others
have argued that it could enhance productivity by promoting social capital. To address
the question empirically, Clotfelter examines the number of JSTOR articles viewed (as a
measure of work done by students and faculty) at 78 research libraries around the time of
the NCAA basketball tournament. He finds that having a team in the tournament reduces
the number of article views and, further, that unexpected wins have especially large effects.
In this paper, we build on this earlier work by considering how academic performance
at a large public university varies with the prominence of university football on campus, as
measured by the team’s winning percentage in a given year. One of the advantages of our
approach that focuses on student GPAs is that it provides a relatively long-run measure of
student performance, whereas Clotfelter may be identifying the inter-temporal substitution
of study time that might not affect levels of learning. In addition, we can exploit the gender
asymmetry in how closely students follow college sports in order to speak to the extent to
which the effects might be driven by professor behavior rather than student behavior.
Our paper also contributes to the large literature on gender differences in higher education, where some have argued that there is a pending “boy crisis.” This concern is often
motivated by the fact that men have fallen further and further behind women in college
attendance and completion over the past thirty years (Goldin, Katz, and Kuziemko, 2006).
As of 2008, 24 to 29 year old females were 17 percent more likely to have attended college
and 29 percent more likely to have completed a baccalaureate degree than similarly-aged
males.5
Of additional concern is the fact that males tend to be less responsive than females
to educational interventions, which suggests that we may need to look beyond traditional
educational policies to better understand the determinants of male performance.6 In this

For example, males have been found to be less responsive, if responsive at all, to achievement awards
(Angrist and Lavy, 2002; Angrist and Lavy, 2009; Angrist, Lang, Oreopoulos, 2009), tuition reductions
(Dynarski, 2008), and offers of academic advising (Angrist, Lang, Oreopoulos, 2009). While Lindo, Sanders,

area, research focusing on the ability level of peers also tends to find greater effects for females
than males whereas studies that explore alcohol consumption and its associated activities
find mixed results.7 Collectively, this research suggests that one would be hard-pressed to
reliably identify an important factor that would have a greater influence on males’ academic
performance than females’ academic performance. While instructor gender might appear to
be a likely candidate, even the research in this area is mixed.8 As such, it is informative
to consider a prominent component of college culture that our priors suggest would exhibit
a pronounced influence on the male population—the hype and interest associated with the
success of the university football team.
The large public university we consider, the University of Oregon, being largely representative of other four-year public institutions and having substantial variation in football
success, provides an ideal setting to explore the effects of big-time college sports. Highlighting the significance of the football team, Figure 1 summarizes the number of football games
students watched during the 2010 season.9 Only 10 percent of females and an even smaller
share of males report watching zero games. Some 40 percent of females watched 10 or more
games out of 12, while over 50 percent of males watched 10 or more games.
and Oreopoulos (2010) consider gender differences in response to an educational intervention, it is not clear
that their results demonstrate that either males or females are “more responsive.” In particular, they find
that being placed on academic probation improves the grades of returning females more than returning
males, but that it causes males to drop out and has no such impact on females. Helping to inform us as to
why females tend to perform better than males in college, Babcock and Marks (2011) document that female
students study more than their male counterparts—why there is a gender difference in time spent studying
is an important question that remains unanswered.
7
In particular, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2006), Han and Li (2009), and Carrell, Hoekstra, and
West (forthcoming) find greater peer effects among females; Foster (2006) finds larger effects for males
but concludes that there is “little evidence of robust residential peer effects on undergraduate performance.”
Kremer and Levy (2008) find that being assigned a heavily-drinking roommate affects males but not females;
Carrell, Hoekstra, and West (2010) find that the effect of legal access to alcohol is similar for males and
females; and Lindo, Swensen, and Waddell (2011) find that the effect of legal access to has affects females
but not males.
8
At the post-secondary level, Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009) find small effects overall but report that
these effects are “driven more by males performing worse when assigned to a female instructor, with females
performing about the same.” In contrast, Carrell, Page, and West (2010) report that “professor gender has
little impact on male students, [but] has a powerful effect on female students’ performance in math and
science classes, their likelihood of taking future math and science courses, and their likelihood of graduating
with a STEM degree.” See Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009) for an in-depth review of the larger literature
that focuses on the primary and secondary levels.

The institutional setting and survey are discussed in detail in later sections.

Our analysis reveals that GPAs vary systematically with the prominence of university
football on campus, as measured by the team’s winning percentage in a given year.10 Our
estimates suggest that three fewer wins in a season would be expected to increase male GPAs
by approximately 0.02, or to reduce the gender gap by seven to nine percent. In order to
speak to the mechanisms at work, we provide evidence that students’ time use and study
behaviors respond differentially by gender to the football team’s performance.11 Given that
females’ time use and study behaviors are also affected by the team’s performance, it is likely
that their performance is affected as well but masked by the usual practice of grade curving.
We also explore heterogeneity across race and measures of socioeconomic status—we find
that the effects are most severe for non-whites and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Data Used in Main Analysis

Our primary source of data is based on student transcripts from the University of Oregon,
covering all undergraduate classes administered from fall quarter of 1999 through winter
quarter of 2007. For our main analysis, we limit the sample to fall quarters to coincide
with the collegiate-football seasons.12 We also limit the sample to non-athlete undergraduate students as we anticipate that athletic success, if not endogeneous to athlete’s academic
performance, may interact differently with student-athlete grades.13 After making these restrictions, our main sample consists of 29,737 students, or 267,322 student-class observations
across nine fall quarters.14
10

Other documented behaviors associated with collegiate football include increased crime (Rees and Schnepel, 2009) and heavy alcohol consumption (Neal and Fromme, 2007; Glassman, Werch, and Bian, 2007;
Glassman, et. al., 2010). Card and Dahl (2011) also find increases in male on female violence associated
with NFL football games.
11
See Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2004) for a discussion on the relationship between time use and
educational outcomes.
12
NCAA Division I-A football runs from late August until early January. Fall terms are in session from
late September until early December.
13
While we are able to identify student athletes, we cannot do so by sport. This prohibits us from dropping
only football players, for example.
14
The implied average number of classes per student is low as we do not observe all students’ complete
tenure at the institution. Normal patterns of attrition from the university also act to lower this ratio.

4

We combine these data with readily available reports of the football team’s win-loss
records which we use to form our term-specific measures of athletic success—the ratio of
total games won to total games played in the regular fall season. Over our sample period,
the winning percentage is 67 percent, on average, and varies from 45 percent to 92 percent.
Beyond the degree of variation in athletic success, this large public university also provides
a somewhat representative setting in terms of institutional and student characteristics. While
twice the size and has higher admission rates than the average public-four-year institution, it
is similar in terms of enrollment rates and SAT scores of incoming students. It is also similar
to the average college in costs of attendance and in financial aid opportunities. Like most
other institutions, the University of Oregon is over half female and predominately white,
although at 75 percent it has a larger share of white students than is typical of the universe
of U.S. post-secondary institutions.15 We report summary characteristics of our data in Table
1. Consistent with the discussion in the introduction, males have systematically lower GPAs
than females. On average, they earn GPAs of 2.94 whereas the average among females is
3.12. This gap is present for first-year students and students who have been at the university
for several years. In unreported analysis, we have verified that the gap cannot be explained
by ability upon entry, as measured by high-school GPAs and SAT scores.

3
3.1

Empirics
Main results

In Panel A of Table 2, we report estimates of the effect of athletic success on male GPAs.
To begin, in Column 1 we estimate

Gijt = α + θW inningP ercentaget + ijt ,

(1)

15
See Lindo, Swensen, Waddell (2011) for additional comparisons to other four-year public U.S. institutions.

5

where Gijt is the grade of student i in class j in the fall term of year t and W inningP ercentaget
is the ratio of wins to total games played in year t; standard errors estimates are clustered
on the student. This simple model leads to an estimate of θ of 0.168. To put this magnitude
into context, consider the fact that a 100 point increase in SAT scores is associated with
a 0.16 increase in GPAs for males. As such, the estimate in Column 1 suggests that a 25
percent increase in the football team’s winning percentage (or three additional wins) leads
males to earn GPAs as if their SAT scores were 27 points lower.
Of course, to the extent to which the university experienced grade inflation in the years
spanned by the data and the football team’s performance got somewhat worse, this estimate
may overstate the negative impact of the football team’s success. Indeed, in Column 2
where we control for a quadratic in time, the point estimate is substantially smaller (-0.052)
although it is remains statistically significant at the one-percent level.
Our preferred estimates are identified off of within-student longitudinal variation in
grades as the football team’s winning percentage varies, corresponding to the regression
equation
Gijt = αi + ψW inningP ercentaget + βXijt + eijt ,

(2)

where αi are individual fixed effects. As this approach isolates the effect of athletic success
on individual-student performance across fall classes and terms, we are implicitly assuming
that the counterfactual for a student’s performance in “high-win terms” is the student’s own
performance in “low-win terms” and vice versa. We prefer this approach because it controls
for the changing composition of the student body from year to year which may not be well
captured by a smooth time trend. Column 3 shows the estimated effect based on this model,
still controlling for the overall time trend in order to address grade inflation; it is smaller
(-0.031) and no longer statistically significant.16
16

While not reported, including controls for fixed student attributes (i.e., math and verbal SAT scores, highschool GPA, age at entry, and indicator variables for Black, Hispanic, and Asian, and for having graduated
from a private high-school) has a similar influence on the point estimate as controlling for individual fixed
effects.

6

In Column 4, we address the fact that the courses that are offered during fall quarters
may differ from year to year and that this might lead to a spurious relationship between the
performance of the football team and student grades. We do so by controlling for subjectby-level fixed effects.17 The estimated effect is unchanged but more precisely estimated with
the addition of these controls.
In Column 5, we take an alternative approach to controlling for time-varying factors,
including fixed effects for the number of credits a student has accumulated before the quarter
begins instead of the overall time trend.18 This approach is motivated by our desire to
control flexibly for the tendency for grades to increase as students make progress towards
their degrees. The estimated effect based on this model (-0.075) is larger and statistically
significant.
It is important to note, however, that the practice of grading student performance on
a curve implies that the estimates in Panel A are likely to understate the true effect on
male performance. For example, if the success of the football team impairs all students’
performance equally, there would be no effect on any student’s GPA under strict curving. In
contrast, if the success of the football team has an especially large impact on the performance
of a particular group of students (males), we would clearly expect to see their GPAs fall
relative to others (females). Further, one would anticipate that latter’s “response” to athletic
success would appear to offset the former’s, consistent with the zero-sum nature of strict
grading curves.
With this in mind, in Panel B we perform the same analysis for the female-student population. All of the point estimates are more positive for females than for males. The estimates
based on our model with individual fixed effects and a quadratic in time are positive and significant. For the reasons described above, this does not imply that athletic success improves
female performance—in Section 4 we present evidence suggesting that female performance is
17

For example, subjects correspond to economics, english, and mathematics, while levels correspond to
either 100-, 200-, 300-, or 400-level classes.

The fixed effects are a series of indicator variables for credits in intervals of four. The overall time trend
must be dropped in order to avoid near-perfect multicolinearity.

likely impaired—but instead likely reflects that the relatively-large impact on males improves
females’ relative performance which translates into higher grades when grades are based on a
curve. In our model that controls for individual fixed effects and the number of credits a student has accumulated before the quarter begins (Column 5), the point estimate for women is
close to zero. Combined with the significant negative estimate for males, this estimate would
suggest that grade curves are not perfectly strict. Additionally, it is important to note that
the estimated effects on females’ GPAs suggest that it is unlikely that the effects on males
are driven by professor behavior. If athletic success led professors to be more generous or
more harsh in assigning grades, we would anticipate observing similar effects on both male
and female students.
As a measure of relative performance, the gender gap in grades is not subject to the
interpretative challenges discussed above. Inasmuch as grading curves are uniformly applied
to male and female students, changes in the gender-gap in GPAs that are systematic with
football performance are clearly indicative of changes in gender-specific performance. Pooling
male and female observations and adding the interaction of winning percentage and an
indicator for being male to the models described above, in Panel C we estimate the effect
of athletic success on the gender gap in grades. The coefficient on the interaction of the
winning percentage with the indicator for being male provides the estimated effect of athletic
success on the gender gap in grades. Whereas the gender-specific estimates varied quite a
bit across different specifications, the estimated impact on the gender gap is quite stable as
the coefficient estimates range from -0.050 to -0.068 across the five columns. Further, they
are statistically significant and virtually identical in columns 4 and 5, which display our
preferred estimates. To put the magnitude of estimate (-0.065) into context, it suggests that
a 25-percent increase in the football team’s winning percentage (or three additional wins)
will increase the gender gap in GPAs (0.18) by nine percent.

8

3.2

Estimated effects using aggregate data

While we prefer the the approach described above because it allows us to control for several
potential confounders, the pattern we have identified is sufficiently regular that it is evident in
a plot of the mean difference between male and female grades and winning percentage across
years. We provide such a plot in Figure 2, for 1999 through 2007. The correlation coefficient
between the difference in grades (i.e., male minus female) and winning percentage is -0.73.
Moreover, aggregating grades to the nine fall-term observations at which the variation in
winning percentage exists and regressing the difference between male and female GPAs on
the winning percentage yields an estimated coefficient of -0.069 and a heteroskedasticityrobust standard-error estimate of 0.025—very close to the point estimates our preferred
estimates in Table 2.

3.3

Estimated effects across letter-grade assignments

Because it offers a clearer interpretation, in this subsection and the subsections that follow,
we focus on the effect of athletic success on the gender gap in GPAs. We also focus on
results based on our preferred models that control for individual fixed effects and subjectby-level fixed effects. However, because there is a tradeoff involved with controlling for time
versus controlling for accumulated credits, we present estimates that take each of these two
approaches in separate panels.
In Table 3, we explore the potential for winning percentage to influence grades nonlinearly across the grade distribution. Specifically, we replace “grade point” with binary
letter-grade assignments on the left-hand side. As such, the coefficient on the interaction
of the indicator for being male and the winning percentage in Column (1) is interpreted as
the difference between males and females in the impact of athletic success on the probability
of receiving a grade of “A” in a given class. Across columns (1) through (4), we observe
meaningful decreases in the probabilities of receiving As and Bs and increases in the probabilities receiving Cs or lower. Clearly, the largest effect on the gender gap appears to occur
9

at the lowest end of the grade distribution. The estimated effect is largest and statistically
significant on the gender gap in the probability of receiving a failing grade.

3.4

This pattern is unique to fall terms

In Table 4, we investigate whether similar effects are found in winter and spring quarters,
where one would not expect the winning percentage to affect student performance. Doing so
provides evidence that only in the quarter we associate with football—the fall quarter—do
we find systematic movement in the gender gap in academic performance that varies with
athletic success.19 Among the eight coefficient estimates for the winter and spring quarters,
corresponding to the overall effect of the winning percentage and the differential effect on
males, just one estimate is statistically significant. If this estimate reflects the truth, it
would suggest that there is a spillover effect of athletic success into the winter quarter that
is similar for males and females. Given our earlier results and the fact that this finding is
not robust across our two preferred specifications, it is most likely significant due to random
chance which would not be surprising to see for one out of eight estimates.

3.5

Heterogeneity

In tables 5 and 6, we explore the extent to which there are heterogeneous effects of athletic
success on the gender gap. While such heterogeneity is interesting for a variety of reasons,
a primary motivation for exploring heterogeneous impacts is to support the external validity of our estimates. For instance, if we see the same phenomenon across different groups
at one large public university, it lends credibility to the idea that similar effects might be
present at institutions with different compositions of students. We first consider heterogeneity across ability and financial-aid eligibility to determine whether our main results are
driven by individuals more likely to struggle with coursework or those from particular eco19
Over our sample time period, the football team did not participate in any bowl games that overlapped
with the winter quarter.

10

nomic backgrounds. We then examine the possibility for heterogeneous effects across race.
Table 5 stratifies the estimates by various measures of ability and relative socio-economic
status. In columns (1) through (4) the estimates are stratified by ability, where “high ability”
students are defined as those with cumulative SAT scores and High School GPAs above the
sample medians and “low ability” students are defined similarly. Using either measure of
ability, there is strong evidence that the effect of athletic success on the gender gap is most
prominent among lower-ability students. For example, Column (2) suggests that, among
low-ability students, the gender gap in grades increases as much as 0.028 in response to
three additional wins in a season, accounting for 14 percent of the existing gender gap (.201)
among those students.
Columns (5) through (8) consider the effects stratified by relative measures of socioeconomic status—in columns (5) and (6) we stratify the sample by whether financial need
is above or below the median need level.20 While we lack direct measures of family income,
we do have student zip codes. Thus, as an alternative measure of socio-economic status, in
columns (7) and (8) we stratify the sample by whether the median household income within
the student’s zip code is above or below that in the median within our sample. Across all
columns, point estimates suggest that the impact on the gender gap is largest among students
from more disadvantaged backgrounds, in terms of measured aid eligibility or approximate
household income.
In Table 6 we provide estimates stratified by race. In columns (1) and (2), we stratify by
white and non-white. Doing so demonstrates that the influence of winning percentage on the
gender gap is significant in both white and non-white student populations, but particularly
strong in the minority student population. In columns (3) through (5), we further stratify
non-white into Black, Hispanic, and Asian. Although estimates are imprecise at this level,
across all students there is suggestive evidence that the largest effects are found in the
black-student population.
20

Note that the sample is also limited to the 70 percent of students who submitted a Free Application for
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

11

In general, we note that the estimated effects on the gender gap are negative in all
regressions presented in tables 5 and 6. This suggests that the overall impact is not being
driven by any one group in particular, even though there is heterogeneity in the effect on
the gender gap among different groups.

Survey Evidence on Mechanisms

To shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving our main results, we surveyed undergraduate classes during three regularly scheduled class times in the 2011 spring term.21 Of
the classes surveyed, 183 students were enrolled in an introductory economics course and 80
were enrolled in either of two upper-division economics courses. The students enrolled in
introductory economics are largely representative of the freshman and sophomore student
body, as introductory economics is a general education requirement for many majors and
the majority of students are in their first or second year of school (90 percent of students
surveyed in this class were freshman/sophomore). The students we surveyed in the upper
division economics courses were primarily (90 percent) juniors and seniors.

4.1

Survey Design

As part of the survey, we collected information on general student characteristics, interest in
the university football team, and information about known or anticipated behavioral changes
around the outcomes of university football games. We focused on alcohol consumption,
partying, studying, and class attendance, with questions worded to elicit differences in these
behaviors when the football team wins relative to when the football team loses. In our
reported survey results, we limit the sample to the 53 percent of students who had been at
the university for two or more years at the time of the survey. While the patterns we report
21
Our survey design is informed by Clotfelter (2011), who reports that students at highly selective big-time
sports universities spend more time exercising and participating in team sports, are more likely to report
binge drinking, and possibly spend less time studying and doing research.

12

are insensitive to this restriction, this ensures that the survey respondents had experienced
a regular-season loss.22

4.2

Survey Results

To broadly measure academic time use related to football success, we collected student responses to the question, “Does the success of the University of Oregon football team decrease
the amount of time you study for classes?” Figure 3 summarizes student responses, where
categorical responses range from “Definitely Not” to “Definitely.” While both distributions
are skewed right, the male distribution shows significantly higher mass to the right, which is
consistent with relatively more males reporting a decrease in study time around a football
“success.” In fact, 24 percent of males report that athletic success either “Definitely” or
“Probably” decreases their study time, compared to only 9 percent of females.
Figure 4 presents student responses to questions regarding changes in alcohol consumption, partying, studying, and class attendance—comparing behaviors when the team wins to
when the team loses. In Panel A, we see that roughly 28 percent of men report a tendency to
increase alcohol consumption when the football team wins rather than loses, while only 20
percent of women report the same.23 Although this difference is not statistically significant,
the results indicate a large effect on males and females and remains suggestive of a more
pronounced effect for men.24
Panel B presents similar results for partying. Despite being unable to determine all
22

Figures for the freshman sample are available on request. In our preferred models, the influence of
winning percentage on fall-term grades is independent of post-season bowl activity (i.e., subsequent to fall
term grades being posted). However, while first-year students had not experienced a regular-season loss at
the time of our survey, they had experienced a loss in the Bowl Championship Series game in January, 2011.
However, one might worry that such a loss may overly influence first-year students’ perceptions of how they
respond to wins versus losses. Anticipating this, we also asked students to compare “big games” to other
games, where big games are described as “a game against a rivalry team, a ranked team, a game that involves
significant hype, etc.” While we do not highlight these responses, similar patterns also occur in these survey
responses.
23
Conditional on reporting that one consumes alcohol, which we collected in the survey, the estimated
difference increases to 12 percentage points (p=0.155).
24
Exploiting survey questions that asked students to compare alcohol consumption leading up to and
following “big games,” the difference between males and females is statistically significant.

13

activities encompassed by students’ definitions of partying, this question allows us to broadly
account for additional behavioral responses beyond alcohol consumption that are associated
with increased excitement following a win. We observe that 28-percent of females report
increased partying when the team wins versus 47-percent of men.25
In terms of educational activities, Panel C shows that the difference between men and
women reporting that they study less when the team wins is approximately 14 percent. Panel
D indicates that female students are slightly more likely to indicate an increased tendency to
miss class associated with a win; however the result is small in magnitude and not significant.
In summary, our survey results lend strong support for a differential impact of athletic
success on male and female behaviors. Relative to females, we observe a decrease in male
academic time investment and an increase in distracting or risky behaviors in response to
increased athletic success. In addition to the gender differential impact, we also find an
impact on female behaviors including studying, alcohol consumption, and partying. While
our previous empirical analysis can primarily speak to relative performance, our survey
results suggest that the aggregate impact of athletic success on academic performance, or
learning, likely extends to females.

Discussion and Conclusion

We identify the effect of football success with longitudinal variation in student-class level
data spanning nine football seasons, 1999 through 2007. Our preferred specifications also
include individual-student fixed effects to identify the effect off of longitudinal variation in
the performance of the university football team to estimate a student’s deviation from his
or her own average performance as the winning percentage varies from its average, making
a comparison of the deviation of males relative to that of females. We also include controls
to account for systematic changes in grades that are expected over time and across courses.
Our estimates suggests male grades fall significantly with the success of the football team.
25

This difference is statistically significant at the five-percent level.

14

There is also pronounced heterogeneity among students, suggesting that the impact is largest
among students from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds and those of relatively low ability.
In addition to our main analysis, we offer insight into the underlying mechanisms that may
be driving the systematic patterns evident in measured academic performance. In particular,
we elicit student responses to questions about behaviors around football outcomes. Beyond
confirming that there is a high level of student viewership and interest in football, survey
responses reveal pronounced gender differences in behavioral responses to athletic success.
Relative to women, men report being more likely to increase alcohol consumption, to decrease
studying, and to increase partying around the success of the football team. Yet, both male
and female students report that their behavior is responsive to athletic success. This suggests
that female performance is likely affected by the performance of the football team as well
but that this effect is masked by the usual practice of grade curving.
As such, our results support the concern that big-time sports are a threat to American
higher education. At the same time, we view our research as taking one of the first steps
towards documenting the non-monetary costs associated with college athletics. Whether it
is desirable to be investing large amount amounts of public and student money in college
sports requires a broad consideration of non-monetary costs, monetary costs, in addition to
the benefits that might be generated in the form of social solidarity and charitable donations.
