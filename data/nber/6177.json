We find that the optimal\" organizational form is determined largely by what implicit contracts it facilitates.  Among other\" things, we also show that vertical integration is an efficient response to widely varying supply\" prices.  Finally, our model suggests why  management' (that is, the development and\" implementation of unwritten rules and codes of conduct) is essential in organizations.  \"\n\n",
