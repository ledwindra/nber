    "abstract": "\n\nMany \ufb01nancial situations present individuals with simple alternatives to solving complex problems. The value of these alternatives depends on whether individuals are sophisticated and know when they are better o\ufb00 opting out of complexity. We tested complexity\u2019s e\ufb00ects and evaluated sophistication in a large and diverse sample. We randomly assigned both complexity to portfolio problems and the o\ufb00er of a simple alternative to portfolio choice. The less-skilled earn lower returns under complexity because they often opt out when the simple alternative is dominated. To interpret the \ufb01ndings, we develop a novel method for estimating the structural parameters of a rational inattention model. The structural estimates are consistent with substantial sophistication. Large fractions of the money that the low-skilled lose by opting out can be justi\ufb01ed by their higher costs of attention.\n\n",
