    "abstract": "\n\nEconomists have for decades recommended that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases be taxed\u2014or otherwise priced\u2014to provide incentives for their reduction. The United States does not have a federal carbon tax; however, many state and federal programs to reduce carbon emissions effectively price carbon\u2014for example, through cap-and-trade systems or regulations. There are also programs that subsidize reductions in carbon emissions. At the 2022 meetings of the American Economic Association, the Society for Benefit-Cost Analysis brought together five well-known economists\u2014Joe Aldy, Dallas Burtraw, Carolyn Fischer, Meredith Fowlie, and Rob Williams\u2014to discuss how the United States does, in fact, price carbon and how it could price carbon. Maureen Cropper chaired the panel. This paper summarizes their remarks.\n\n",

Williams III\n\nI served during calendar years 2019-2021 as Chief Economist for the Climate Leadership Council, which advocates for a US federal carbon fee and dividend.  I do not see this as creating any conflict of interest, but felt it was better to err on the side of over-disclosure.\n\n\n"
