    "abstract": "\n\nA factorization of the basis for any block-angular 12 model is presented, and its inverse is shown to be readily maintainable as piecemeal product-forms plus possible additional columns. Straightforward rules for piecemeal transformation of full rows and columns are given.\n\n",
