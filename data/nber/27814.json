    "abstract": "\n\nAlthough there is a substantial literature indicating that unemployment and joblessness have profound adverse impacts on individuals\u2019 health and wellbeing, there is relatively little evidence of their impact on sleep.  Using data for over 3.5 million individuals in the United States over the period 2006-2019 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey series we show sleep disruption patterns that vary by labor market status. We look at sleep measured by hours in a day and days in a month and whether sleep is disturbed over a fortnight, as indicated by problems falling or staying asleep or staying asleep too much. We find the short-term unemployed suffer more short and long sleep than the employed and are more likely to suffer from disturbed sleep.  These problems are greater still for the long-term unemployed and for the jobless who say they are unable to work.\n\n",
