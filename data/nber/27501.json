    "abstract": "\n\nUsing a new case-level dataset we document a set of stylized facts on bankruptcy in China and study how the staggered introduction of specialized courts across Chinese cities a\ufb00ects insolvency resolution and the local economy. For identi\ufb01cation, we compare bankruptcy cases handled by specialized versus traditional civil courts within the same city and \ufb01led in the same year. We \ufb01nd that specialized courts decrease case duration by 36% relative to traditional civil courts. We provide evidence consistent with court specialization increasing e\ufb03ciency via selection of better trained judges and higher judicial independence from local politicians. We document that cities introducing specialized courts experience a relative reallocation of employment out of zombie-\ufb01rms-intensive sectors, as well as faster \ufb01rm entry and a larger increase in average capital productivity.\n\n",
