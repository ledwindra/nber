                      The "End-of-Expansion" Phenomenon
                     In Short-Run Productivity Behavior


                                  ABSTRACT


     The slowdown in the long-term growth rate of U.S. productivity has generated

widespread concern and numerous studies.     The present paper makes no contribution

to an understanding of the long-term slowdown; rather, its main objective is to

examine the short-run behavior of aggregate labor productivity in isolation.

     In addition to the phenomenon of short-run increasing returns to labor identi-

fied in previous studies, the paper isolates a little-noticed but consistent tendency

for productivity to perform poorly in the last stages of    th~   business expansion.     In

1956, 1960, 1969, 1973, and again in 1979, a productivity shortfall has developed

with absolute declines in the level of productivity occurring in every episode but

the first, and in every episode before 1979 the shortfall has subsequently been

made up.

     This paper contains estimates of regression equations that explain the response

of changes in hours to changes in current and lagged output.      Versions of the

equation containing a new "end-of-expansion" variable perform better than those

lacking this element and provide a much more accurate ability to track the behavior

of productivity, both within the sample period and in post-sample-period extrapola-

tions for 1978-79.   The end-of-expansion effect is attributed to inertia and overop-

timism .in business personnel policies.    The paper concludes that the absolute decline

in the level of labor productivity in 1979 is consistent with the predictions of the

equations based on past history, but that the trend growth of productivity began a

further slowdown in 1977-78 from the already poor performance recorded       du~ing   1973-76.

                     THE "END-OF-EXPANSION" PHENOMENON

                   IN SHORT-RUN PRODUCTIVITY BEHAVIOR

     "I believe the principal explanation lies in the momentum and
     overoptimism of personnel policies." -- Arthur M. Okun



     The startling decline in U. S.   aggregat~   labor productivity during

the first three quarters of 1979 (a 2.3 percent decline in the nonfarm sector

at an annual rate) adds new urgency to the continuing concern about U. S.

productivity behavior.    Several important recent studies have documented

a slowdown in the secular growth rate of productivity that has taken place

in two stages, the first beginning in 1965 or 1966 and the second in 1973,

and most studies appear to leave the causes of a large portion of the

deceleration as an unresolved puzzle. 1    Does the 1979 experience suggest

that a third stage of the secular slowdown has begun, or is this recent

behavior consistent with previous occurrences at the same stage of the

business cycle?
                                                                        2

     Many studies of the short-run cyclical behavior of labor productivity

have been by-products of larger studies of secular trends.   In the work

of Perry and Hordhaus, for instance, a cyclical correction was required

to construct measures of aggregate "normal" or "potential" productivity

for studies of long-term trends and the sources of shifts in these trends. 2

This paper makes no contribution to an understanding of the secular slow-

down in productivity other than contributing a new cyclical correction of

the long-run trend.   Rather its main objective is to examine the short-

run behavior of aggregate labor productivity in isolation.   In addition

to the phenomenon of short-run "increasing returns to labor'" (SRIRL)

identified in previous studies, it isolates a little-noticed but con-

sistent tendency for productivity to perform poorly in the last stages

of the business expansion.   In 1956, 1960, 1969, 1973, and now again in

1979, a productivity shortfall has developed, with absolute declines in

the level of productivity occurring in every episode but the first, and

in every episode before 1979 the shortfall has subsequently been made up.

The paper is more successful in identifying this "end-of-expansion"

phenomenon than in explaining it; the results suggest that firms tend

consistently to hire more workers in the last stages of the business ex-

pansion than is justified by the level of output.

     An improved understanding of the short-run behavior of productivity,
while of far less importance than an unraveling of the secular slowdown

puzzle, nevertheless has relevance for several issues.   Any forecast of

the paths of employment and unemployment that will accompany a given path

of real output over the next few quarters requires a decomposition of
                                                                     3

recent productivity changes into their permanent and transitory components,

as does the early recognition of shifts in the secular growth rate of

productivity, and hence of the likely medium-term trends in potential GNP

and in the full-employment government budget.   Further, the same decom-

position is required for structural price equations that attempt to ex-

plain the extent to which firms respond to changes in actual labor pro-

ductivity by altering prices rather than profits. 3


AltePnative Specifications of the Short-run Productivity Relation

     A common feature of previous work by Nordhaus, Perry, and others, is

the explanation of procyclical fluctuations in average labor productivity

as resulting from the partial adjustment of the ratio of aggregate labor

hours to potential hours (Ht/H *) in response to fluctuations in the ratio
                               t

                                        *
of actual to potential real output (Qt/Qt):



                         =                             [3 < 1.




The assumption that the parameter of adjustment ([3) is less than unity

can be interpreted as reflecting the variability of capital utilization

and the fixity of some portion of labor input. 4

     The statistical estimation of equation (1) cannot proceed until a

procedure is devised to construct time series for potential hours and real

output.   One of the two missing variables can be eliminated if it is

                                        * *t ) grows at the exponential
assumed that "potential productivity" (Q/H

                                                                         4

              (2)         =


where B is a constant term.       Perry's estimation procedure has been to

                      * and then to construct a time series for potential
use (2) to eliminate Qt'

hours.    Nordhaus used (2) to eliminate H* and then constructed a time
                                          t
series for potential output.      No matter which procedure is chosen, there

is no escape from the necessity to select one or the other "potential"

series, and thus to impose a criterion for deciding what conditions

represent the economy's '·potential."

     Since this paper is concerned only with short-run adjustment, it

eschews any discussion of problems involved in constructing potential

output measures and instead adopts the series recently constructed by

Perlof and Wachter. 5      Substituting (2) into (1) to eliminate potential

hours, we obtain:


              (3)          =



               -1
where A   =   B '.   Equation (3) can be estimated directly, and can be made

more flexible by allowing lagged values of the output ratio as well as

the current ratio to influence hours, and by allowing for several differ-

ent time trends to capture the effect of the slowdown in secular produc-

tivity growth.

     The time period examined in this paper begins in 1954:2, the trough

of the first post-Korean recession, and extends until the most recent

available quarter.       All regression equations are estimated over the period

ending in 1977:4, allowing the use of data for 1978 and 1979 for an
                                                                           5

evaluation of the aspects of productivity behavior in recent quarters

that are not predicted by the regressions.    The raw data exhibit the much-

discussed slowdown in secular growth rates; in this paper the dividing

lines initiating the two kinks in the secular trend occur at 1965:4 and

1972:4. 6   The respective quarterly growth rates for the three periods,

expressed at annual rates, are 2.75 percent for 1954:2 through 1965:4,

1.96 percent for 1966:1 through 1972:4, and 0.88 percent for 1973:1

through 1979:2.    Thus the overall slowdown between the first and third

periods is 1.87 percent.


Regpession Equations Relating Houps to Output

      There is no attempt here to estimate the stark and simple version of

the hours-adjustment equation represented by (3).     Instead, all our

estimates differ from (3) by including three lagged output terms and in

allowing for a broken time trend.    Rather than estimate three separate

time trends, all equations (except those covering sub-periods) include (a)

a time trend for the whole period, (b) a second treud to measure the ex-

tent and significance of a slowdown during 1966:1-1972:4 from the overall

trend, and (c) a third trend to measure the extent and significance of a

slowdown during 1973:1-1977:4 from the overall trend.

      The first equation to be estimated followed Nordhaus and Perry and

relation (3) by specifying both dependent and independent variables as

levels of logs.7    The results are not included in Table 1, because a very

low Durbin-Watson statistic suggested the presence of positive serial

correlation.    When the level equation was re-estimated with a Cochrane-

Orcutt correction, the estimated first-order serial correlation coefficient

was 0.883, suggesting that the relation written in equation (3) should

be respecified with the data expressed in first differences.   When lower-

case letters are used to represent quarterly percentage changes, equation

(3) can be rewritten as:


           (4)


      The basic first-difference result is presented in column (1) of Table

1.   An interesting feature at the top of column (1) is the statistical in-

significance of the 1966-72 secular slowdown.   Indeed, this weakness of

evidence supporting "Slowdown I" is a consistent feature of all the first-

difference equations in this paper.   "Slowdown 11,11 on the other hand,

is consistently significant, although the size of its coefficient (roughly

1.4 percentage points) is somewhat smaller than a crude calculation of the

size of the slowdown (1.9 percentage points).' The difference represents

the impact of the high level of resource utilization in 1965 as compared

to 1977.

      There is a serious problem with the basic first-difference version

in column (1) that is not evident in the summary statistics presented in

Table 1.   Although the Durbin-Watson statistic for the equation is 1.73,

and although the Cochrane-Orcutt estimate of the first-order serial

correlation is not statistically significant at the 5 percent level,

nevertheless the residuals of the equation display a distinctively non-

ran?om pattern.   The residuals tend to be positive for a number of

quarters, followed by a solid string of negative values:
                                                                   8

         1974:4                                          7/8

Thus of the 94 observations in this regression equation, fully 73 are

included in these uniformly signed "strings."   It is the negatively

correlated zig-zag pattern of the remaining residuals that keeps the

Durbin-Watson statistic from accurately revealing the nature of the serial

correlation problem in this equation.

     This pattern of autocorrelation poses two interesting questions that

are relevant to an improved understanding of recent short-run productivity

fluctuations.   First, can the pattern of residuals be explained by some

set of economic time series variables?   Second, if the pattern of residuals

cannot be explained statistically, 'can it be described in any helpful or

interesting way?

     Initially I assumed that it would be possible to explain the pattern

of the residuals by some mixed autoregressive-moving-average statistical
                                                                              9

process.     For instance, if there were an inertial process in hiring that

caused a firm to base this period's hiring plans on last period's out-

come, then one would expect a significant role to be played by lagged de-

pendent variables.    To test this hypothesis four lagged values of the

dependent variable were added to column (1) and every other first-differ-

ence equation estimated in Table 1.     In no case was any lagged dependent

variable significant, even at the 10 percent level.     Another supposition

was that firms might make systematic errors in predicting output by basing

their expectations on too long a moving average of past changes in output.

But the addition of further lagged values of output to the equations in

Table 1 makes no important contribution other than picking up a seasonal

pattern. 8    These negative findings apply not only to the equations

estimated for the full 1954:2-1977:4 sample period, but also to equations

estimated separately for the first and last half of that period.


Specification of the "End-of-expansion Effect"

     While it does not appear possible to explain the mysterious residuals

in any conventional sense, it nevertheless is possible to "characterize"

them in an appealing and interesting way.     We date the last phase of the

business cycle expansion as beginning when the ratio of real GNP to potential

              * reaches its peak.
real GNP (Qt/Qt)                       Up until that time real output has

been rising faster than its long-run trend, and thus business firms may

have discovered that their real sales have outstripped their previous plans

and expectations, requiring upward revisions of plans for both hiring and

capital investment.     Managers of individual firms, each buoyed by a series
                                                                             10


of quarters when things have worked out better than expected, may feel

justified in extrapolating this performance into the future.     Given the

economy's limited capacity to produce, the realization of each of their

plans in some episodes would have required that each firm simultaneously

raise its market share.

     A dummy variable can be created that captures this "end-of-expansion

effect."     Each cyclical episode is constrained to commence in the

                                      * which for the five NBER
quarter after the peak quarter of Qt/Qt'

business cycles since 1954:2 has occurred in 1955:4, 1959:2, 1968:3,

1973:1, and 1978:4. 9   Because it is assumed that managers eventually

recognize that they have too many people on the payroll and take corrective

measures, the dummy variable is constructed to take positive values for

M quarters following the quarters when Qt/Qt* reaches its peak, and then

to take negative values for N quarters thereafter.    The variable is con-

strained to sum to zero over any given business cycle, and thus does not

distort the meaning of the secular trend coefficients in the hours re-

gressions.    An additional constraint is imposed by setting the values of

M and N equal to the same number for each cycle.     The values of M and N

that best describe the process are six and eight quarters, respectively.

The larger value of N reflects the tendency for firms to take their

corrective action over a longer period than the time taken for the over-

staffing problem to occur. IO

     In Table 1,co1umn.(2) illustrates the effect of adding the "end-of-

expansion" (EOE) dummy variable to the equation in column (3).     Line El

indicates that the dummy variable is extremely significant statistically,
                                                                    11

with a t   ratio of 5.6i11    The variable is defined so that its coefficient

indicates the cumulative percentage amount of overhiring that occurred on

average over all cycles; during the six quarters of overhiring (M=6) hours

reached a level 2.22 percent higher than can be explained by the behavior

of current and lagged output, and this 2.22 percentage point excess was

gradually eliminated over the subsequent eight quarters (N=8).12         The sum

of the coefficients on current and lagged output is about the same in

both columns (1) and (2) and indicates only a partial response of hours,

the effect known as "short-run increasing returns to labor."      Thus the

fitted coefficients in equation (2) combine the traditional procyclical

fluctuations in the level of labor productivity together with an indica-

tion of unusual weakness in the last stage of the business expansion.

     Several additional equations are presented in Table 1 to determine

whether the significance of the EOE effect is due to a particular business

cycle, or rather reflects a phenomenon that operates during each cycle.

Column (3) is identical to column (2) but allows a separate value of the

EOE dummy variable to enter after 1973:1.      The coefficient on this variable

in line E2 would be zero if the behavior of productivity during the 1973-74

episode were the same as the average of the previous cycles, and would be

positive if there were a greater tendency toward excess staffing and

slack productivity   i~   that episode.   It is apparent from line E2 that the

1973-74 episode was special, with a cumulative excess hiring of 2.01 percent

over and above the "normal" EOE effect of 1. 80 percent, for a total of 3.81

percent.   Despite the unusual nature of the 1973-74 period, the coefficient

on the overall EOE effect drops only slightly in moving from column (2)
                                                                           12

to (3), and its t ratio is still a robust 4.23.

     The final two columns of Table 1 report the results that are obtained

when the sample period is split in half, with separate estimates for

1954:3-1966:1 and 1966:2-1977:4.   The major impact of the split sample

results is to make the 1974 episode look less "special."   In Line E2 of

column (5) the coefficient on the 1973-74 effect is reduced to 1.41 percent

with a t ratio of only 1.22, below the 10 percent level of significance.

Despite the isolation of the 1968-69 and 1973-74 episodes in column (5),

there still seems to be a significant end-of-expansion effect evident in

column (4) for the first half of the sample period.   The productivity

slump of 1956 has long stood as evidence that the simple procycli,cal

story of equation (1) above is an incomplete representation of the short-

run behavior of productivity, and a similar cessation in productivity

growth occurred in the next business-cycle expansion after the Q /Q* peak
                                                                 t   t
was reached in 1959:2.   The excellent performance of productivity during

the first two years of the Kennedy Administration can thus be partly ex-

plained through the normal working of the "rebound" phase of the EOE effect.


Attempting to Explain the End-of-Expansion Effect

     So far we have succeeded only in describing the end-of-expansion ef-

feet without providing any kind of behavioral explanation of its origins.

We are first led to ask whether the sluggish response of aggregate hours

at the end of business expansions represents the behavior of employment or

hours per employee (HPE).   To answer this question separate regression

equations were estimated corresponding to each column of Table 1 in which
                                                                            13

employment and HPE alternatively replaced aggregate hours as the in-

dependent variable.     Since quarterly changes in employment and HPE add

up to quarterly changes in aggregate hours by definition, it is not sur-

prising to find that the sum of the coefficients on the EOE dummy in the

separate employment and HPE equations add up to the coefficient in the

aggregate hours equation displayed in column (3) of Table 1.      Of the 1.80

percentage point total EOE effect, 1.26 points are contributed by employ-

ment and 0.54 points by HPE.     Thus it would appear that the EOE phenomenon

primarily involves the maintenance of an excessive number of employees

relative to output, with hours per employee making a minor additional con-

tribution. 13

     Several suggestions have been made to explain the EOE phenomenon as

being consistent with rational profit-maximizing behavior.      First, labor

and capital may be interdependent factors of production.      In periods when

capital investment is relatively high, extra employees may be required to

install new equipment, and experienced employees may have to work over-

time to train new employees.     These "installation costs"   would decrease

when investment is low.     To test this proposition the de trended ratio of

fixed nonresidential investment to potential GNP was entered into the

basic equation (column 3) in the form of both its level and first difference.

The t ratios were miniscule, and the size of the EOE coefficients was not

affected.

     A second suggestion is that firms maintain some slack in their labor

force when the quit rate is high to guard against being caught short-

handed.     This slack subsequently disappears during periods when the quit
                                                                              14

rate is low and firms no longer are concerned that key employees may

depart.   Both the level and first difference of the manufacturing quit

rate were added to the basic equation in column (3) with the same nega-

tive outcome as in the case of investment;   t   ratios were below the margin

of significance, while the EOE coefficients were unaffected.

     An inspection of the data reveals little relation between invest-
ment and the periods when the EOE effect has its main impact.      For instance,

the ratio of investment to potential GNP was higher in 1965 and early 1966

than at any other time in the post-1954 period, and yet productivity was

rising rapidly and the residuals in column (I) are negative.      Similarly,

the quit rate was high throughout the prosperous 1966-69 interval, whereas

the EOE effect came into play only in late 1968.

     There might seem to be a role for the real wage in explaining the

EOE effect.   In periods when the real wage is decreasing firms may find

that labor is cheap, leading to more employment in relation to output.

When the current and lagged real wage were added to the basic equation, in-

deed there appeared to be a significant negative set of real-wage coef-

ficients that eliminated the post-1973:l dummy variable, although the size

and significance of the overall EOE dummy was left intact.       Almost all

of this negative correlation between employment and the real wage occurs

in 1974, when the OPEC oil shock occurred.       I would interpret this rela-

tionship between the EOE effect and the real wage as representing the

common impact of the oil shock rather than a highly elastic short-run de-

mand curve for labor; nominal wage inertia allowed OPEC price increases to

reduce the U. S. real wage sharply and promptly, while inertia in employ-
                                                                            15

ment decisions allowed the sharp decline in output caused by the OPEC

shock to show up as an unusually severe decline in labor productivity.

     A final set of tests investigated the statistical legitimacy of the

form of the equations displayed in Table 1.     In principle the relation

between output and hours could be tested with either hours or output on

the left-hand side of the equation to be estimated.     Following the pro-

cedure employed by Christopher Sims in his previous investigation of

manufacturing productivity, an alternative equation was estimated with

the rate of change of output on the 1e£t, and leading as well as current

and lagged changes in hours on the right.     A symmetric equation was es-

timatedthat adds leading values of output change to column (3) of

Table 1.    The results are completely consistent with the view that output

is exogenous with respect to hours; leading values of hours had large and

significant coefficients in the output equation, but leading values of

output had insignificant coefficients in the hours equation. 14    A satis-

fying feature of this additional set of tests is that the EOE dummies are

strongly significant (and of course with the opposite sign) when the re-

lationship is estimated with output change as the dependent variab1e. IS


Interpreting the 1978-79 Productivity Performance

     The last section at the bottom of Table 1 lists the post-sample extra-

~olations   of the equations.   All equations but that in column (3) predict a

growth rate of productivity during 1978-79 that is larger than the actual

outcome, and thus a higher level of productivity than has actually occurred.

The forecast errors become successively smaller as we move from column (1)
                                                                            16

to (3), with an underprediction of productivity of 0.05 percentage points

in column (3) and overprediction of only 0.27 percentage points in column

(5).     Comparing the four equations, we note that the equations in columns

(3) and (5) that include the significant post-1973:l dummy predict a larger

decline in productivity than actually occurred in 1978-79.     The ability of

these equations to "track" the precipitous decline in the level of produc-

tivity during the first half of 1979 results from the impact of the EOE

effect (which first takes place in 1979:1), as well as from the assumption

in those columns that the extra 1973-74 effect applies equally to 1979. 16

        In Figure 1 the actual values of the level of nonfarm productivity

between 1967 and 1979 are compared with the predictions of levels implied

by the fitted values of two growth rate equations, the simple version

presented in column (1) of Table 1 (re-estimated for the 1966-77 period)

shown as the dotted line and the version incorporating the EOE effect estimated

for the same sample period in column (5) of Table 1 and shown as the dashed

line.     A comparison of the dashed and dotted lines illustrates the role of

the EOE effect in improving the explanation of the absolute decline in

productivity in 1969 and 1973-74, as well as the subsequent rebound in 1970-

72 and 1975-76.     The post-sample extrapolation of the dashed line also

captures the decline in productivity during the first half of 1979, al-

though its level is between one-half and one percentage point too high

throughout 1977, 1978, and 1979, suggesting that a third slowdown in the

secular trend may have begun in early 1977.

Conclusion
    While the coefficients of dummy variables in regression equations

cannot actually explain puzzling phenomena, at least they help to identify

and describe interesting features of economic behavior.     In my own pre-

vious work I have tested the significance of dummy variables for the 1971-

74 price controls and subsequent post-controls rebound as an aid in des-

cribing U. S. price behavior, and "wage push" dummy variables in wage

equations for various European countries.     In each case there was an exter-

nal event identified by contemporary accounts to help date and describe

the phenomenon captured by the dummy variables.     In this paper, the "end-

of expansion" dummy variables are statistically significant and operate con-

sistently across business cycles, but their interpretation is more con-

jectural.    My conjecture is that the phenomenon stems from mistaken ex-

pectations and from inertia in changing personnel budgets.     While no

direct evidence is presented here that misperceptions actually occurred,

at least the data are consistent with our imposed constraint that the dum-

my variable sums to zero, thus forcing any end-of-expansion overstaffing

to be eliminated in subsequent periods.

     In an early version of this paper I likened the EOE effect to other

phenomena in economic time series involving overshooting, including booms

in the stock market and overbuilding in the commercial construction in-

dustry.     Yet at a deeper level these two examples of overshooting are

very different in nature.     Stock market participants deal in an auction

market in which there is no inertia beyond the expectations of other mar-

ket participants that limit price movements, and in which there is no exter-
                                                                    19


nal guidepost to indicate a "correct" level of prices.     Expectations in

September, 1929, were incorrect only ex post and did not appear so at the

time.     In commercial construction, on the other'hand, overbuilding may

result from the long lags between decision making and project completion,

imparting an inertia to the behavior of nonresidential construction exnendi-

tures that is familiar to students of business cycles.     The end-of-exnansion

phenomenon of overstaffing may result from a similar lag between business de-
cisions that set personnel budgets and the actual carrying out of hiring,

training, and promotions.     Business firms may not be irrational or even

guilty of mistaken expectations at the time that the personnel budgets are

set, but rather may gradually recognize an overstaffing condition and

be unable to correct it rapidly due to the high costs of more frequent

decision'making and to the inevitable time taken to prune the workforce

purely by attrition when layoffs are costly.

        At the more immediate level of current policy discussions, the

results in this paper suggest that standard equations may tend regularly

to overpredict productivity growth during the interval following a

cyclical peak in the ratio of actual to potential output.     A corollary is

the tendency for simple versions of "Okun's Law" to fail to explain why

unemployment remains so low and employment so high at the end of expan-

sions and the beginning of contractions. 17    Thus current forecasts based

on conventional productivity equations may be unduly pessimistic about the

increase in unemployment that will occur during late 1979 and early 1980,

but overly optimistic for subsequent periods.
                                                                   20

     Finally, the structure of hours adjustment described in this paper

should be noted by the NBER business cycle dating group and those who

compile the cyclical indicators published monthly in Business Conditions

Digest.   The consistent lag of hours behind output, combined with the

end-of-expansion overhiring effect, converts hours into a lagging in-

dicato~   that should not be included in the coincident indicators and

should play no role in discussions of business-cycle dating. I8

      ginally from the need to distinguish between actual and trend pro-

      tically significant slowdown in the 1965-73 period, so the 1966:1

      breakpoint was chosen to make the results roughly comparable to the

      Norsworthy-Harper-Kunze study in this volume.

      potential series for total real GNP, adjusted for the slower trend

      growth of nonfarm real GNP relative to total real GNP over the 1953-79

       yet declared the existence of a recession in 1979.    Nevertheless, it

       seemed likely that a recession would begin late in 1979 or early in

       1980, and that in retrospect 1978:4 would represent the peak in Q/Q * .

       The three quarters of 1979 all had Q/Q * values significantly below the

       ratio registered in 1978:4.

10.   The only exception to the statement made in the text is that, reflecting

       the shorter and sharper business cycle of the mid 1950s, M=4 and N=6

       for the period beginning with the Qt/Qt* peak in 1955:4.

11.   In Table 1 space is saved by showing exact values of t ratios only

       for the EOE dummies, while the significance of other variables is

       indicated by asterisks.

12.   As an example the dummy variable is defined as 1/6 for the first six

       quarters following 1968:3 and as -1/8 for the subsequent eight quarters.

13.   A further indication that most of the EOE effect stems from employment

       rather than HPE is the high t ratio of 3.89 on the EOE dummy in the

       employment equation, as opposed to a t ratio of only 1.17 in the hours

       equation.   For the post-1973:1 effect employment and liPE each make an

       equal contribution of about one percentage point with t ratios that are

      marginally significant at the ten percent level.      Similar results were

       obtained when equations were run for the two sub-periods.

14.   For more on the interpretation of these techniques, see Sims,    '~utput


       and Labor Input in Manufacturing."   In my tests only two leading

       quarterly values were included, in contrast to the larger number of

       leading values included in Sims' study of monthly data.     The only

       significant coefficient on a leading value of output in the hours
                                                                               24

        equation occurred with a two-quarter lead, but the coefficient had the

       wrong sign (negative).

15.    George Perry has inquired whether the EOE effect might be explained in

       part by the cyclical mix of output.    One would expect productivity to

        fall and employment to appear too large in years when the output of

       high productivity industries like automobiles is falling.      While de-

        clining automobile sales may be part of the problem in 1973-74,

        the timing is wrong in earlier cycles.   For instance, auto sales fell

        off from 1965 into 1966-67 as severely as in 1969-70, yet the EOE

        effect only shows up in 1969 and not in 1966.

16.    Even the unadorned first-difference   ~quation   in column (1) predicts an

       absolute decline in productivity during the first three quarters of

       1979, due to the impact of rapid 1978 output growth on 1979 hiring

       through the lagged output terms.

 17.   Arthur Okun is well aware of this problem and in fact has explained

       the low level of unemployment in 1974 in the quote at the beginning

       of this paper.   See Artuhr M. Okun, "Unemployment and Output in 1974,"

       BPEA, 2:1974, p. 503.

       published monthly in Business Conditions Digest.
