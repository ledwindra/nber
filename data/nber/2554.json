    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents estimates of the productivity and factor bias effects of interindustry R&D spillovers for five high-tech industries. Each industry is distinguished as a separate spillover source. The industries are each affected by R&D spillovers and are themselves spillover sources. Thus a spillover network between the industries is estimated. Private and social rates of return to R&D capital are calculated. The private rates of return are generally greater than the returns to physical capital. In addition, the social rates of return are greater than the private rates. The results show that there are significant differences between industries as to their importance as sources of R&D spillovers.\n\n",
