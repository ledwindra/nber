Investing in the Presence of Massive Flows: The Case of MSCI Country Reclassifications
Terence C. Burnham, Harry Gakidis, and Jeffrey Wurgler
NBER Working Paper No. 23557
June 2017
JEL No. G11,G12,G14
ABSTRACT
Almost $10 trillion is benchmarked to Morgan Stanley Capital International’s Developed,
Emerging, Frontier, and standalone market indexes. Reclassifications from one index to another
require thousands of investors to decide how to react. We study a comprehensive sample of past
reclassifications to inform this decision. On average, reclassified markets’ prices substantially
overshoot between the announcement and effective dates—prices fall when a market moves from
an index with more benchmarked ownership to one with less, such from Emerging to Frontier,
and vice-versa—but largely revert within a year. We identify alpha-maximizing responses to
reclassifications for both benchmarked and more flexible investors.

Morgan Stanley Capital International’s Developed Markets, Emerging Markets,
and Frontier Markets Indexes provide benchmarks for stock markets at different stages of
development and international investability. The Indexes are used to allocate trillions of
dollars in equities by thousands of proper indexers, active asset managers, pension funds,
hedge funds, banks, and individuals around the world. Other major index providers also
classify equity markets into development levels, but the MSCI classifications are by far
the most followed for global equities investing (for example, see MSCI (2016a) and
Authers (2015)).
The MSCI’s Index Policy Committee reclassifies markets when investability
conditions change. Its criteria encompass openness to foreign ownership, the ease of
capital flows, the efficiency of the operational framework, and the stability of the
institutional framework.2 Qatar and the United Arab Emirates graduated from Frontier to
Emerging status in June 2014 after institutional improvements, for example. Trinidad and
Tobago was declared unsuitable for even the Frontier index in February 2011, on the
other hand, and since June of that year has been tracked only as a standalone market.
Most recently, MSCI upgraded Pakistan to the Emerging index, effective May 2017.
Table 1 lists the major, non-partial reclassifications between 2000 and 2015.3
Openness criteria include investor qualification requirements, foreign ownership limits, foreign room
levels, and the rights of foreign vs. domestic investors. Ease-of-Flows criteria include capital flow
restrictions and degree of currency market liberalization. Operational Framework criteria include
registration & account setup difficulty, market regulations, information flow, clearing and settlement,
custody, registry/depository considerations, trade execution, transferability, stock lending and short selling.
Also considered are the degree of competition among financial services providers and the stability of the
institutional framework. There is an additional requirement on gross national income per capita for
Developed status. See MSCI Global Market Accessibility Review (2016b).

We exclude Serbia’s and Lithuania’s 2008 reclassifications. Their announcements conditioned the final
decision on aspects of market performance between the announcement and the potential effective date,
making it unclear what if anything investors should be doing in the meantime. In addition, the Frontier
index was introduced in 2007. We do not include the markets included at the inception of this index since
the announcement and effective dates were nearly contemporaneous and, presumably, the flows associated
with the classification would be small.

Given the huge importance of the MSCI indexes and the fact that reclassifications
require thousands of asset managers to decide how to react, it is surprising that there has
been little systematic study of what happens around reclassification events. The most
closely related scholarly study is Saidi, Prasad, and Naik (2012), who focus on a small
number of Middle Eastern countries’ reclassifications between Frontier and Emerging
indexes, and the brokerage research we could find is also anecdotal or event-specific.
In this short paper, we address these basic questions: What happens to returns
around market reclassification events? Should a benchmarked investor trade at the
announcement date? Wait a few months until the effective date? Wait for a year while the
dust settles? Break the tie based on non-alpha considerations such as tracking error? Does
it matter whether the investor tracks the new or old index? Are “upgrades” always good
and “downgrades” always bad? Are there opportunities for unbenchmarked investors? To
answer these questions, we study the 17 reclassifications between 2000 and 2015 listed in
Table 1. The sample, while small, is comprehensive for this sample period.
It is not possible to observe flows directly, and abnormal trading volume is
difficult to measure given the changing circumstances of the markets involved and the
varying lengths of time between the announcement and effective dates, but the return
patterns we document appear to highlight the importance of flows. Using MSCI data on
the extent of benchmarking—which includes both passive indexers and active managers
who use an index as a benchmark—we find that when a market is moved from a lessbenchmarked to a more-benchmarked index, such as from Frontier to Emerging, its
MSCI country index rises between the announcement and effective date by around 15%.
By one year after the effective date, however, this upward price pressure appears to have

3

fully reverted. We also find that the overshooting happens in reverse when a market is
reclassified to a less-benchmarked index.
For investors, the large returns around reclassifications illustrate the importance
of properly accommodating the event. We delineate the alpha-maximizing policies for
benchmarked and more flexible investors. The results also shed broader light on market
resiliency and price pressures writ large, because MSCI reclassifications are uniquely
important events for the markets involved. The patterns are clearly inconsistent with a
simple “upgrades are good, downgrades are bad” hypothesis. If a reclassification is a
positive event, it should be permanently so. Instead, the results are most consistent with
differences in demand for the reclassified market by those benchmarked to the old and
new index causing short-run price pressures that eventually revert.

Supply, Demand, and Index Inclusion Effects

It might surprise the layman that stock market prices are often studied at the
highest practitioner and academic levels with no explicit reference to supply and demand.
For many purposes in finance, that is a reasonable simplification, but it is hard to justify
in the context of the potentially large rebalancing-driven demand changes around market
reclassifications. What does prior research lead us to expect around these events?
Efficient markets theory—embraced by many passive indexers—would, in the
extreme, imply that we will observe no price change. Under this view, reclassifications
are inconsequential because stock fundamentals are unchanged. They are simply
decisions made by a committee of non-investors who are not even attempting to evaluate

4

investment merits and are using largely public information. Any observed change in
return properties such as risk or liquidity would be attributed to the structural changes
that drove reclassifications in the first place, not the reclassifications themselves.
An alternative view, associated with inefficient markets and active management,
is that stock prices sometimes respond to supply and demand forces unrelated to
fundamentals. Adherents of this view would also acknowledge the structural and
operational changes leading to reclassification events, but they would suggest that the
trading of passive index funds—not to mention other categories of benchmarked
investors—might contribute to the very distortions that their investors deny.
The accumulated evidence from other index inclusion settings suggests that we
should not be surprised if reclassifications cause price dynamics. The classic research in
this area involves S&P 500 inclusions. Harris and Gurel (1986) and Shleifer (1986) both
argue that such inclusions contain no information about stock fundamentals, consistent
with the stated position of the S&P Index Policy Committee, and both find that inclusions
are associated with price jumps of a few percentage points. An important point of
disagreement is that Harris and Gurel find that this jump eventually reverts.
In October 1989, the S&P changed its announcement policy. It separated the
announcement date of a change from the effective date. Lynch and Mendenhall (1997)
find that this policy introduced a jump on the announcement, a further rise between the
announcement and effective date, and a partial reversion thereafter. Since the effective
date is even more plainly informationless than the announcement itself, this is compelling
evidence that inclusions induce price pressures.

5

More recently, Madhavan (2003) and Cai and Houge (2008) find inclusion effects
for the Russell 2000, and Petajisto (2011) finds that the S&P 500 inclusion effects have
grown since the early studies. Kaul, Mehrota, and Morck (2000) study a unique
experiment from the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 and find more evidence of demandinduced price changes, thus extending the evidence on index inclusion effects to
international markets. In a setting closer to our own, albeit still involving individual
stock-level events and only a three-year time sample, Chakrabarti, Huang, Jayaraman,
and Lee (2005) find that inclusions into the MSCI country indexes beget a rise between
the announcement and effective date, which partially reverts. See Petajisto (2009) and
Wurgler (2011) for further overviews of this large literature.
In modern, liquid markets, how can information-free inclusion effects persist?
Apparently, basic supply and demand considerations overwhelm short-term arbitrage
forces. Wurgler and Zhuravskaya (2002) point out that Scholes’s (1972) classical
efficient markets argument—that sophisticated investors would elastically supply new
investor demand for the included stock because they can simply short an equivalent
stock—isn’t realistic. The vast majority of an individual stock’s variability is
idiosyncratic. There is no washing away of this risk through a long-short trade, and no
way to form a portfolio of inclusions when they are isolated events.
The classical logic fails even more strongly at the level of MSCI country
reclassifications. Who would have shorted a basket of U.A.E. stocks to accommodate the
sudden demand from benchmarkers that followed its upgrade to the Emerging index?
What exactly would those investors buy in order to hedge the risk that U.A.E.
fundamentals improved while they were short? Put together, the theory and evidence

6

suggest that we should not be surprised if MSCI country reclassifications generate
interesting price dynamics. How interesting presumably depends on how much demand
actually changes. We approach this question next.

Potential Flows Around Reclassifications

In the case of MSCI reclassifications, thousands of benchmarked funds must
consider how to adjust their holdings in a short period of time, and passive indexers will
presumably do so fully. In light of the nearly $10 trillion now benchmarked to the MSCI
indexes, the collective action of these non-fundamental traders may be large.
To get a sense of the magnitudes involved it is helpful to understand how MSCI
indexes are constructed. A highly simplified explanation, with some relevant caveats and
details noted later in the paper, is as follows. Each index involved is roughly valueweighted (to be more precise, free-float weighted). MSCI country return indexes are
averages of a set of major stocks trading in the local market. Regional sub-indexes are
averages of a set of country indexes. Finally, the major indexes, including Developed,
Emerging, and Frontier indexes, are averages of combinations of the above.
The tiered and approximately cap-weighted structure of the indexes allows us to
estimate the size of the potential flows associated with a reclassification. If benchmarked
investors hold shares at index weights, then, under idealized assumptions, the net
percentage flow driven by the reclassification itself is the difference between the fraction
of the new index held by index-tracking investors and the fraction of the old index held
by index-tracking investors.

7

Although actual flows driven by reclassification events are difficult to track, it is
possible to obtain some rough upper bounds using Table 2. The key data in Table 2 are
the estimates of net percentage index ownership from MSCI. For example, classification
as an Emerging Market entails inclusion not only in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,
where the percentage of benchmarked ownership is high (45% as of June 2014), but also
in the All Country World Index, where the percentage of benchmarked ownership is low
(6% as of June 2014). The cap-weighted structure of the Indexes implies that
approximately 51% of a given Emerging Market is owned by benchmarkers at that date.
A further promotion from Emerging to Developed, on the other hand, may
actually cause a net decline in index-tracking ownership, at least in recent years. The
country’s ACWI status does not change, but—in the most recent data—it stands to lose
its 45% ownership from its Emerging index affiliation while replacing this with only
about 32% from its new inclusions into the World index, the Europe, Australasia and Far
East index, or (typically) either the Europe or Asia ex-Japan index. This net decline may
be contrary to intuition, given that so many more dollars are benchmarked to Developed
than Emerging, and perhaps a general intuition that an upgrade must somehow be better
than a downgrade. However, in the same way there can be a larger clientele for a
corporate bond at one rating than at the next-higher rating, whether a country is upgraded
or downgraded need have no fundamental bearing on aggregate demand by benchmarked
investors.
Using these coarse estimates to calculate reclassification-driven flows should be
done with great caution. First, fund families that track the old index in one vehicle and
the new index in another may be able to transfer some of their holdings through internal

8

accounting, which would not contribute any price pressure. Second, actively-managed
funds using an index as a benchmark may, as a group, overweight or underweight some
countries relative to their actual index weights. Third, benchmarkers may decide that the
reclassification event is too small to be worth responding to any time soon. In general,
any tracking error and portfolio alpha consequences of a reclassification will typically be
far greater for the followers of the lesser-developed index, given its smaller total cap.
Fourth, to the extent that investability criteria differ between the old and the new index,
an upgrade means that some stocks will be sold by those benchmarked to the old index
and not bought by those following the new index; conversely, a downgrade means that
some stocks will be bought by those benchmarked to the new index but are not being sold
by those benchmarked to the old index. For example, when a market is moved from
Frontier to Emerging, a few stocks that were included in the Frontier will not satisfy the
new and stricter liquidity and size criteria. For these stocks, the demand by benchmarked
investors will actually fall, rather than rise dramatically. We return to this point below.
Finally, benchmarking is often a matter of degree. Our data do not distinguish between
funds devoted to indexing strategies and funds that are more loosely benchmarked. How
this distinction would affect the results is an interesting topic for future research.
In light of such limitations, it is most appropriate to regard the net flows to
reclassifications implied by Table 2 as directionally correct for the majority of stocks,
especially on a capitalization-weighted basis. However, it is an idealized estimate of the
net flows that follow reclassifications and is most likely overstated for many lessdeveloped markets. We therefore group events simply by the ordering of net demand by

9

benchmarkers—Emerging (highest), Developed, Frontier, standalone (lowest)—and do
not attempt to make detailed estimates of demand elasticities.

Returns Around Reclassifications

The ultimate question is whether, and how, reclassifications affect returns.
Typically, when a market’s accessibility has been improving or deteriorating, MSCI
announces that it has been placed on a watch list, gathers feedback from institutional
investors over the next several months, and then announces a decision to reclassify the
market or to remove it from the watch list. If the market is reclassified, MSCI specifies a
date, again several months down the road, at which the reclassification becomes
effective.
For most investors, the relevant dates involve the announcement and effective
dates of reclassifications. We look for patterns between the announcement and effective
date (excluding both dates themselves) and, to detect reversion, between the effective
date (inclusive) and one year afterward. We do not examine price dynamics around the
watch list date because it has no clear investment implication for the majority of
benchmarkers.
We measure alphas on the reclassified country’s index in two ways. For investors
using the old benchmark, a relevant notion of alpha is the country index return over that
benchmark. For investors in the new benchmark, a relevant comparison is with the new
benchmark. For reclassifications from (to) standalone status, we calculate the old (new)
benchmark as zero and track total returns. With such a small number of events and the

10

question of how to take account of differences in risk across what are already benchmark
indexes, more detailed risk adjustments are difficult. The Appendix lists all sample
returns for the concerned reader.
A limitation of our returns data is the use of MSCI country indexes rather than the
precise subset of stocks affected by a switch. MSCI changes the constituents of the
country index when the market is reclassified. In an upgrade, some companies that were
allowed into the old index may not make the cut. For them, the selling pressure from
those benchmarked to the old index is not offset by buying demand from those
benchmarked to the new index. Likewise, in a downgrade, stocks in the old index will be
affected but additional stocks will now meet the new, lower bar. This issue is somewhat
ameliorated by the value-weighted nature of the country indexes, since the largest stocks
in the country will always be included in either the upgrade portfolio or the downgrade
portfolio. In any event, the use of country indexes typically biases our results against
detecting an effect.
Figure 1 presents the main results. In the top panel, we track the average returns
on country indexes for the nine reclassifications that, according to the estimates in Table
2, most likely resulted in less ownership by benchmarkers. In these cases, there was
likely to have been net selling pressure as investors adjusted. The results are indeed
consistent with short-term selling pressure which subsequently abated. The average total
return between the announcement and effective dates was -12.5%, but this loss was more
than recovered in the 23.3% total return in the year after the effective date. Using returns
relative to the original index or the new index—two notions of alpha—leads to the same
impression of a large fall followed by a substantial reversion.

11

In the bottom panel, we track the average returns for the eight reclassifications
that most likely resulted in more ownership by benchmarkers, and therefore net buying
pressure around the event. Here, and also strongly consistent with an overshooting pricepressure pattern, we see the opposite pattern in returns. There is a 23.2% total return
between the announcement date and effective date, but this is to a large extent given back
by the -12.4% return after the effective date. (We view the similarity in returns reported
in this paragraph and the previous paragraph as coincidental.)
These differences in average returns between less- and more-benchmarked
reclassifications are so large that they are statistically significant despite the modest
sample size. For example, the -12.5% announcement-to-effective date total return in the
less-benchmarked case is significantly lower than the corresponding 23.2% return in the
more-benchmarked case (t = -2.1). The 23.3% post-effective total return in the lessbenchmarked case is significantly greater than the corresponding -12.4% post-effective
date return in the more-benchmarked case (t = 2.6).
We cannot rule out a complete return reversal. The sample is too small and
returns are too variable to reject the hypothesis that the initial drop is equal and opposite
to the subsequent rebound in Panel A. Likewise, we cannot reject that the initial rise is
equal and opposite to the subsequent drop in Panel B.
How do upgrades and downgrades compare? Buying pressure tends to be higher
for upgrades, so one might ask whether it is the direction of the reclassification that really
matters. An upgrade would seem to increase visibility and liquidity, after all, and such
effects might be reflected in positive returns even after the event. In unreported results,
we split the sample between upgrades and downgrades. The results are similar to the split

12

across predicted net flows. (In fact, they are slightly weaker, but the sorts are hard to
separate statistically because the direction of reclassification and the direction of new
flows by benchmarkers are highly correlated.) The fact that the two splits lead to similar
results tells us something important and consistent with only the price pressure story. If
upgrades were good for valuations, they should be permanently good. If downgrades
were bad for valuations, they should be permanently bad. Instead, the data show that
alphas between the announcement and effective dates tend to revert in the same pattern
that we see in the Figure 1 sorts. A simplistic “upgrades are good for returns, downgrades
are bad” view of MSCI reclassifications is not as consistent with our findings as a
temporary price pressure explanation.
What happens right around the announcement and effective dates? If the action is
too fast then both the implications for market efficiency and the strategic investment
opportunities are narrower. To investigate this, we excluded short windows around the
event dates, but found that the results are only slightly weakened. For example, the
average total return between two days after the announcement date and two days before
the effective date is -9.2% for classifications that decrease benchmarked ownership and
21.3% for classifications that increase it. These closely resemble the numbers in Figure 1.
The post-effective reversion effects are also similar upon excluding short windows
around event dates.
Finally, we examined risk and liquidity patterns around reclassifications. An
interesting possibility is that the reclassified country index’s beta with respect to the new
index increases over time and the beta with respect to the old index decreases. Vijh
(1994) and Barberis, Shleifer, and Wurgler (2005) document such a pattern for S&P 500

13

changes. We did not find any significant changes in the MSCI reclassification setting,
however. We also looked at the first-order autocorrelation of country indexes as a proxy
for liquidity, but we found no changes in autocorrelations for upgrades or downgrades.

Implications

Our core finding is that countries transitioning into a less-benchmarked
classification face net selling pressure, and negative alpha, between the announcement
and effective dates. After the move becomes effective and the selling pressure abates,
there is a reversion with positive alpha. The opposite is true when countries move toward
a more-benchmarked classification. In each case the long-run return is roughly flat.
These patterns do not matter for passive indexers devoted solely to matching a
benchmark. Those investors must rebalance at, or very near, the effective dates. But there
are important implications for benchmarkers that have discretion. Table 3 summarizes the
alpha-maximizing strategies implied by the evidence.
In some cases, the best trade is unambiguous. When a market is downgraded from
Emerging to Frontier, for example, those benchmarked to the Frontier index should buy
on the effective date. This not only eliminates the tracking error of buying early, it avoids
the low returns associated with the net selling pressure between the announcement and
effective dates. Conversely, for upgrades from Frontier to Emerging, those benchmarked
to Frontier should wait to sell on the effective date. This allows Frontier benchmarkers to
ride the net buying pressure before the effective date and, again, eliminates tracking error.

14

In other cases, the optimal strategy is less obvious, and alpha effects must be
balanced against tracking error. Consider a reclassification from Frontier to Emerging
from the perspective of Emerging benchmarkers. Buying at the effective date has the
benefit of no tracking error. But it also means buying at the peak: the buying-pressuredriven return between announcement and effective has been missed, while any posteffective reversion has still to be endured. There are two strategies to avoid negative
alpha. One is to buy at announcement and hold through both the run-up and the reversion.
The other strategy is to buy well after the effective date, when the cycle will have played
out. Both strategies involve accepting some tracking error.
The advice for absolute return investors is straightforward enough to not be worth
tabulating. They should underweight the reclassified market in situations when its
expected returns are low and vice-versa. Figure 1 clearly identifies these situations.
The alpha point estimates in Figure 1 are, as usual, upper bounds on what might
have been attainable in practice. The MSCI country index returns being analyzed are capweighted, so they already emphasize the most investable and liquid stocks. As of this
writing, expense ratios for MSCI iShares are less than 100 basis points and inside spreads
are 25 basis points or less, including for Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the two
most recent cases in Table 1, which also had the highest total return between the
announcement and the effective date. But it would have been difficult for a U.S. investor
to take a large position in, say, Trinidad & Tobago after it was downgraded from the
Frontier index. And, of course, if the abnormal returns are created by price pressure in the
first place, trading to take advantage of them would tend to reduce profits.

15

An interesting question for future research is the extent to which market
reclassifications also affect unreclassified markets. Downgrades may require those
benchmarked to the new index to sell existing markets to accommodate a new constituent
market which may enter with a very high weight, perhaps 20% of the reconstituted new
index. Likewise, upgrades may lead to significant buying pressure across the remaining
old index members. It is possible that global equities benchmarking is now pervasive
enough to produce such spillover effects.
To wrap up, MSCI market reclassifications do not happen every day, but when
they do happen they can be important events for thousands of asset managers and tens of
millions of end investors. The analysis of past reclassifications sheds new light on the
effects of benchmark-driven ownership and identifies strategies to help benchmarked
investors take best advantage of large, predictable price pressures.

Table 2. Benchmarked Ownership by MSCI Market Classification. The percentage
of ownership by benchmarkers is estimated as the ratio of benchmarked assets of that
index, from private correspondence with MSCI, to the total capitalization of that index,
estimated from MSCI Index Factsheets data. Assets benchmarked to the Frontier Markets
Index are estimated from the Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR) database. The
Total % Benchmarked to the Developed Market Index includes the average of Europe
and Asia (ex-Japan).

Table 3. Alpha-Maximizing Policies Around MSCI Market Reclassifications. Historical alpha-maximizing strategies based on
sample of 17 reclassifications between 2000 and 2015. Note that some multi-level reclassifications, e.g. Frontier to Developed, have
not occurred in this sample. Appropriate strategy is inferred from observed historical events.

pressure but misses reversion after the
effective date. In upgrades from Emerging to
Developed, tradeoff needs to be weighed
carefully due to (likely) present high weight
in Emerging index.

Reclassification to a MoreBenchmarked Index: DM to
EM, FM to DM/EM, Standalone
to FM/EM/DM

Sell on effective date. Pre-effective net
buying pressure and tracking error
minimization both point to selling at effective
date.

23

If Benchmarked to New Index

Buy on announcement or several months
after effective date. Both strategies involve
tracking error. Buying at announcement
benefits from pre-effective net buying
pressure but suffers from reversion after
effective date. In downgrades from Developed
to Emerging (or below), tradeoff with
tracking error needs to be weighed carefully
due to likely high weight in new (smaller-cap)
index.

Appendix. Returns Around MSCI Market Reclassifications. Returns are calculated using daily MSCI Standard Country Indexes to
account for intramonth event dates. Excess returns are calculated relative to the MSCI FM, EM, DM Indexes except where the market
is tracked as a standalone, in which case only its total return is considered. The “+1 Year” return is based on the return over the next
365 calendar days.
