    "abstract": "\n\nGovernments go to great lengths to attract foreign multinationals because they are thought to raise the wages paid to their employees (direct e\ufb00ects) and to improve outcomes at local domestic \ufb01rms (indirect e\ufb00ects). We construct the \ufb01rst U.S. employer-employee dataset with foreign ownership information from tax records to measure these direct and indirect e\ufb00ects. We \ufb01nd the average direct e\ufb00ect of a foreign multinational \ufb01rm on its U.S. workers is a 7 percent increase in wages. This premium is larger for higher skilled workers and for the employees of \ufb01rms from high GDP per capita countries. We \ufb01nd evidence that it is membership in a multinational production network\u2014instead of foreignness\u2014that generates the foreign \ufb01rm premium. We leverage the past spatial clustering of foreign-owned \ufb01rms by country of owner-ship to identify the indirect e\ufb00ects. An expansion in the foreign multinational share of commuting zone employment substantially increases the employment, value added, and\u2014for higher earning workers\u2014wages at local domestic-owned \ufb01rms. Per job created by a foreign multinational, our estimates suggest annual gains of 13,400 USD to the aggregate wages of local incumbents, two-thirds of which are from indirect e\ufb00ects. Our estimates suggest that\u2014via mega-deals for subsidies from local governments\u2014foreign multinationals are able to extract a sizable fraction of the local surplus they generate.\n\n",
