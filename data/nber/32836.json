    "abstract": "\n\nI introduce money into an incomplete markets model with heterogeneous agents and uninsurable income risk. I show that the model exhibits both non-monetary and monetary equilibria, with the latter existing when income risk is sufficiently high. Using numerical methods, I characterize the properties of these equilibria and analyze their stability. I find that for a range of realistic parameter values, the non-monetary equilibrium is dynamically inefficient and indeterminate, and there is a second determinate monetary equilibrium with positive valued fiat money.\n\n",
