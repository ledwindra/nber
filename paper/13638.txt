ABSTRACT
Gender-Based Taxation (GBT) satisfies Ramsey’s rule of optimality because it taxes at a lower rate
the more elastic labor supply of women. This holds when different elasticities between men and women
are taken as exogenous. We study GBT in a model in which labor supply elasticities emerge endogenously
from the bargained allocation of goods and time in the family. We explore the cases of superior bargaining
power for men, higher men wages and higher women productivity in home duties. In all cases, men
commit to a career in the market and take less home duties than women. As a result, their market work
becomes less substitutable to home duty and their labor supply responds less to changes in the market
wage. When society can resolve its distributional concerns efficiently with gender-specific lump sum
transfers, GBT with higher marginal tax rates on (single and married) men is optimal. In addition,
GBT affects the intrafamily bargaining, leading to a more balanced allocation of labor market outcomes
across spouses and a smaller gender gap in labor supply elasticities.

Introduction

According to optimal taxation theory a benevolent government should tax less individuals
who have a more elastic labor supply. The labor supply of women is more elastic than the
labor supply of men. Therefore, tax rates on labor income should be lower for women than
for men.
This argument is known in the academic literature, but currently it is hardly taken seriously as a policy proposal.1 On the contrary, as Table 1 shows, many OECD countries
effectively impose higher marginal tax rates on married women’s decision to participate in
the labor market, relative to the tax rate on singles.2 It is surprising that while the simple
proposal of taxing women less than men has never been seriously “on the table,” a host of
other gender-based policies are routinely discussed, and often implemented, such as genderbased affirmative action, quotas, different retirement policies for men and women, child care
subsidies and maternal leaves.3 This is puzzling because a system of differentiated taxes by
gender is also likely to achieve the goals of these interventions (namely, to promote female
employment) but possibly with fewer distortions.
The optimality of Gender-Based Taxation (GBT) hinges on the assumption that men and
women have different elasticities of labor supply. If the labor supply elasticity is taken as
a primitive, exogenous parameter that differentiates genders, then the argument is straightforward. GBT generates gains in welfare, income and employment because it minimizes the
aggregate social loss from distortionary labor income taxation. However, differences in the
labor supply functions of men and women, including their elasticities, most likely do not
only depend on innate characteristics or preferences but may emerge endogenously from the
1

As part of the Reagan tax cut of 1981, a 10% of earnings deduction for secondary earners effectively
reduced women’s marginal tax rates. However, the deduction was abolished five years later by the Tax Reform
Act of 1986. See Bosworth and Burtless (1992) for the effects of these tax reforms on labor supply. Two
proposals of tax reform explicitly aimed at introducing forms of gender-based taxation have been presented
to the Italian Parliament in 2010, but they have not yet been taken into consideration by the parliamentary
agenda.
2
Joint taxation typically results in higher marginal tax rates for women as the income of the second earner
is pooled with that of the first earner. Even with separate taxation, the participation decision of second
earners is effectively taxed at a higher rate, relative to that of singles, in systems where the dependent spouse
allowance is lost when both family members work or due to other similar family-based measures. In addition,
in countries where retired couples receive pensions that increase with the benefit of the highest earner, the
effective payroll tax of first earners is lower than that of second earners (Feldstein and Liebman, 2002). For
instance, in the US a retired couple receives 150% of the pension of the highest earner, which implies that
married men close to retirement face a close to zero (or even negative) social security marginal tax rate.
3
For instance, gender-based affirmative action is common in the US. Spain and Norway have recently
introduced stringent quota systems in favor of women. Public support for child care is common in many
European countries. Sweden has recently reformed its paternal leave policy with the goal of inducing men to
stay more at home with children and women to participate more continuously in the labor market.

internal organization of the family. In fact, as documented by Goldin (2006), Blau and Kahn
(2007) and Albanesi and Olivetti (2007), both the participation rate and the elasticity of labor
supply of women evolve over time as a result of technologically or culturally induced change
in the family.4 Despite the importance of the elasticity of labor supply for income taxation
theory, its deeper causes have been little explored in the literature.5
Therefore, we explore the implications of GBT in a model in which the elasticities of
labor supply arise endogenously from the internal organization of the family. We consider a
representative married couple in a collective family model with individualistic preferences and
Pareto efficient allocations. The economies of scale and the public goods provision that family
members enjoy imply an equilibrium in which everybody marries but the allocation of utilities
in the marriage is determined by the off-equilibrium utility when single. Spouses Nash-bargain
on the allocation of market goods, household goods, working time in the market and home
duties. Any distributional consideration in the family is resolved efficiently by appropriate
side payments. The elasticity of labor supply increases in the ratio of home duties to market
work, indicating that as the market wage changes, market hours respond more for the spouse
who can find more substitutes to his or her market work. The positive association between the
amount of home duties and the elasticity of labor supply in our model accords well with recent
evidence.6 Finally, we also consider the effects of a pre-marital career choice. Committing to
a high-wage career is costly in terms of effort and stress but allows workers to do well in the
market by acquiring specific technical skills that offer higher returns in the market.
We consider two broad cases that sustain a gendered equilibrium. One is the case in which
women assume more home duties because they have a comparative advantage in them. This
case can arise when men receive exogenously (i.e. for a given career decision) a higher wage
than women in the market or when women are, for exogenous reasons, more productive (or
derive more pleasure) than men in performing home duties. This case leads to a gendered
equilibrium with unbalanced allocations of market and home work both because of differences
in preference or technology parameters and because men, in anticipation of their exogenous
comparative advantage, decide to commit to a high-wage career in the market.
While it is certainly a fact that women take more home duties than men, as pointed out
4

Alesina and Giuliano (2010) study the effects of different cultural traits and family values on women’s
labor force participation. Ichino and Moretti (2009) show instead how more persistent biological gender
differences may affect the absenteeism of men and women and, indirectly, the labor market equilibrium.
5
Kaplow (2008, 339–341) discusses the importance of pursuing this research agenda.
6
Aguiar and Hurst (2007) and Blau and Kahn (2007) document decreases in the (woman to man) ratio of
home duties and in the ratio of elasticities of labor supply in the last two decades. These ratios, however, still
remain well above one.

3

by the time use studies of Aguiar and Hurst (2007) and Burda, Hamermesh and Weil (2007),
whether this is because women have a comparative advantage in home duties is questionable in
modern times, as argued by Albanesi and Olivetti (2007), given the technological advancement
in the household sector. Thus, we explore a second case in which, for cultural or historical
reasons from a period of time where physical power mattered, men have a higher bargaining
power than women. In this case, career choices, effective wages, the allocation of working
time and the elasticities of labor supply differ across genders even though men and women
are identical in their inherent market and home productivity.
When bargaining power is unbalanced, on the one hand women tend to pursue higherwage careers than men in order to increase their implicit bargaining power and offset the
cultural or historical bias. But on the other hand, men anticipate that by committing to a
higher-wage career they will be able to appropriate a larger share of the enlarged “marital pie”
because of their superior bargaining power. When the economies of scale at the household
level become relatively important, men’s incentive to choose a career with higher wages than
women and to appropriate a larger share of the enlarged marital surplus increases. As a result
of differences in pre-marital commitments to careers, men work more in the market, take less
home duties and earn more than their spouses. Men’s labor supply is less sensitive to changes
in the wage since what matters for them, relative to women, is also the utility they derive
from committing to a career in the market with longer market hours and less home duties.
Given the success of the model to explain several facts of the time use behavior of men and
women, we consider the optimal gender-specific linear tax schedule. Our setup is closer to the
Ramsey tradition since we postulate the tax schedule, rather than derive it from informational
frictions as in the Mirrlees tradition. Importantly, our gender-specific tax schedules apply to
individuals regardless of marital status. This is quite different than analyzing the policy of
applying different income taxes only to married because the differential taxation of singles
affects the outside option of married and thus the bargaining positions within the marriage.
The family bargaining, even if fully efficient, does not internalize how a given allocation
of goods and time affects government finances. Imagine that, for one of the above reasons,
in equilibrium the family bargaining produces an allocation of goods and time such that
the labor supply and the career elasticities of men and women are different, namely higher
for women. Then, the government faces an incentive to tax men and women differently in
order to minimize the distortionary costs of taxation according to the Ramsey (1927) “inverse
elasticity rule.” If the society can resolve any distributional concern efficiently (e.g. by making
gender-specific lump sum transfers), then the slope of the tax schedule is solely determined
4

by the gender difference in elasticities. In turn, the family reacts to the differentiated tax
rates and evolves to an equilibrium with more balanced allocations of career opportunities and
home duties across genders. As a result, GBT endogenously closes the gender elasticity gap.
We show how this fixed point problem leads, under mild conditions, to an equilibrium with
higher marginal tax rates for men and labor supply elasticities that have converged relative
to the case of non-differential taxation by gender.
Relative to models in which the labor supply elasticity is taken as an exogenous parameter, we can also interpret our model in terms of a difference between short versus long-run
effects of GBT. The case in which labor supply functions and their different elasticities across
genders are exogenous can be interpreted as the short-run, namely an horizon in which the
family organization is not likely to change. In the long-run, instead, the family responds to
government policies and evolves to a new equilibrium with a different organization.
We illustrate the link between our model and the literature in Section 2. Section 3 discusses
the model and Section 4 presents its solution. Section 5 analyzes the existence of a gendered
equilibrium. Section 6 discusses Gender-Based Taxation. Section 7 presents caveats and
several extensions for future research. The Appendix contains details of our derivations.

Related Literature

The paper lies at the intersection of three research strands. The first is concerned with the
structure of the family.7 The traditional “unitary” approach, in the spirit of Samuelson (1956)
and Becker (1974), treats households as single decision making units. This approach lacks the
foundations to conduct intrahousehold welfare analysis.8 The “collective approach” to family
modeling, initiated by Chiappori (1988, 1992) and Apps and Rees (1988), builds on individualistic preferences and postulates that collective decisions lie on the Pareto frontier. Manser
and Brown (1980) and McElroy and Horney (1981) were the first to “select” a specific point
on the Pareto frontier by assuming that family members Nash-bargain on the allocation of
commodities. Our model belongs to the collective approach with Nash-bargained allocations.
The second relevant strand of literature refers to the taxation of couples. Rosen (1977)
and mainly Boskin and Sheshinski (1983) were the first to point out the efficiency gains from
the differential taxation of men and women.9 This argument also relates to the insight that
7

See Lundberg and Pollak (1996) and Vermeulen (2002) for excellent surveys.
Two notable empirical failures of the unitary model are the restrictions that arise from the income pooling
hypothesis and the symmetry of the Slutsky matrix. See Thomas (1990), Browning, Bourguignon, Chiappori
and Lechene (1994), Lundberg, Pollak and Wales (1997) and Browning and Chiappori (1998).

The argument was raised using variants of the Diamond and Mirrlees (1971a and 1971b) and Atkinson
8

taxes should be conditioned on non-modifiable characteristics as in Akerlof (1978) and Kremer (2003).10 The conventional wisdom regarding lower taxes for women can be challenged or
reinforced in at least three ways. First, it might be the case that women’s tax rate is a more
efficient policy instrument when considering redistribution across households. Apps and Rees
(2007) place the conventional wisdom on a firmer basis and give intuitive and empirically
plausible conditions under which it is optimal to tax men at a higher rate even with heterogeneous households. Second, Piggott and Whalley (1996) raise the issue of intrahousehold
distortion of efficiency in models with household production. Since the optimal tax schedule
must maintain productive efficiency (Diamond and Mirrlees 1971a), imposing differential tax
treatment distorts the intrahousehold allocation of resources and raises a further cost for the
society. Apps and Rees (1999b) and Gottfried and Richter (1999) show that the cost of distorting the intrahousehold allocation of resources cannot offset the gains from taxing on an
individual basis according to the standard Ramsey principle. We explore the optimality of
GBT in a model in which a third potential critique applies. This is the case in which intrahousehold redistribution is explicitly taken into account and the elasticities of labor supply
emerge endogenously from family bargaining.11
The third strand of literature explains gender differences in labor markets. In Becker
(1985) gender differences in earnings arise when women undertake tiring activities that reduce work effort. So, workers with the same level of human capital, earn wages that are
inversely related to their housework commitment. The substitutability between home duties and market earnings also arises in our model, although we also consider the effect of a
costly career choice. Traditional theories assume that women have a comparative advantage
in home production and men in market production, but Albanesi and Olivetti (2007) show
how improved medical capital and the introduction of the infant formula have reduced the
importance of this factor. Greenwood, Seshadri and Yorukoglu (2005) focus instead on the
and Stiglitz (1972) frameworks. The elasticity of labor supply is also a key parameter in the Mirrlees (1971)
framework. For an ambitious paper that takes the latter approach see Kleven, Kreiner and Saez (2009). In
a Mirrleesian framework with non-linear tax schedules, there are two factors that favor GBT. First, all else
equal, the optimal tax formula supports a uniformly lower marginal tax rate for women because of the inverse
elasticity rule (see e.g. Diamond, 1998). In addition, since the distribution of income for women has more
mass concentrated towards the low income levels, its hazard rate is typically higher and therefore marginal tax
rates for women should be lower. See also Cremer, Gahvari and Lozachmeur (2010) who develop analytical
results for income tagging with two groups that differ in their ability distribution.
10
Weinzierl (2008) analyzes the benefits of age-based taxation which is related but not equivalent to other
tags such as gender or height. Mankiw and Weinzierl (2010) apply the idea of tagging to height and discuss
the validity of the welfarist approach to optimal taxation.
11
Brett (1998) is an important earlier paper discussing intrahousehold redistribution. See also Apps and
Rees (1999a, 2007) for models with household production. Gugl (2009) analyzes the effects of income splitting
on intrahousehold distribution.

introduction of labor-saving consumer durables (such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners) which liberated women from chores and expanded their labor market participation. In a
model with incentive constraints, Albanesi and Olivetti (2009) argue that gender differences
arise from firms’ expectations that the economy is on a gendered equilibrium.
Regarding the elasticity of labor supply, Goldin (2006) documents that the fast rise of
married women’s labor supply elasticity over 1930-1970 resulted from a decreasing income
effect and an increasing, due to part time employment, substitution effect. During the last
thirty years, she argues, women started viewing employment as a long term career rather
than as a job and the substitution effect decreased. This interpretation is consistent with
how we model the elasticity effect of a commitment to stay in the labor market in order to
take advantage of the opportunities offered by it. Blundell and MaCurdy (1999) find a large
gender difference in own wage elasticities for married couples, with men’s elasticities near
zero and women’s at 0.8 in the 1970s and the 1980s. Blau and Khan (2007) document and
quantify the reduction in the labor elasticity of married women in the US in the 1980s and
1990s. However, this elasticity remains well above that of men, at a ratio of about 4 to 1.
Even in Sweden where gender differences in labor market outcomes are arguably less dramatic
than elsewhere, Gelber (2010) estimates that married women’s elasticity of labor supply is
twice as large as married men’s elasticity of labor supply.

The Model

The timing of the model is the following. First, the government chooses the tax policy. We
consider gender-specific linear tax schedules of the form:
Ti = τi Ii − πi

(1)

where i = m, f denotes the gender, Ii is total labor income, τi ≥ 0 is the marginal tax rate,
πi is a lump sum transfer (when positive) and Ti is the total tax liability. The government
raises revenues to finance an exogenous level of expenditure, Tm + Tf ≥ G > 0.
Second, given the tax schedule and before the couple decides whether to marry or not, men
and women choose non-cooperatively their career ei . We interpret ei as all those commitments
that allow workers to choose a market career with high wages, including investing effort in
acquiring technical skills.12 There is a continuum of careers ordered by their salary per unit of
12

While it is well known that the gender gap in college education has reversed (Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko,
2006), it is still a fact that men specialize in more technical subjects that offer higher returns in the job market.
For example, Zafar (2009) documents that in 1999-2000, among recipients of bachelor’s degrees in the United

7

hour worked, wi ei . In other words, the choice of career ei produces labor income Ii = wi ei ni ,
where wi is the exogenous wage rate and ni is total hours worked in the market.13 Thus,
choosing a higher-wage career (a higher ei ) acts like a labor demand shifter and increases
the effective wage (wi ei ) of supplying ni hours of work in the market. However, pursuing a
higher-wage career is costly in terms of time and effort to acquire technical skills and produces
more stress in the market. Careers are chosen to maximize expected utility:
max Ωi = Φ(ei ) − C(ei )
ei

(2)

where Φ(ei ) denotes the (net of career costs) expected utility of spouse i = m, f and C(ei )
denotes career costs. The cost function satisfies C ′ > 0 and C ′′ > 0 and has a constant
elasticity of marginal cost, E = C ′′ e/C ′ .
Third, given the tax schedule and the career choice, the representative couple decides
whether to marry or to remain single. If the couple decides to marry, then men and women
Nash-bargain on side payments and the allocation of consumption goods, household goods
(public and private) and working time in the market and at home. First, we discuss the utility
function. Second, we specify the threat points in the bargaining problem which we take to be
the utility when single.14 Third, we describe the Nash-bargaining problem.

3.1

Preferences

We adopt the following utility function:
e −
U = c + H(.)

1
(n + h)1+φ
1+φ

(3)

e is consumption of household goods, n is hours
where c is consumption of the market good, H(.)

of market work, h is the amount of home duties and φ > 0 is the curvature of the disutility of
e
working a total of n + h hours. The household good, H(.),
depends on own home duties for

States, 13% of women majored in education compared to 4% of men and only 2% of women majored in
engineering compared to 12% of men.
13
The exogeneity of wi means a flat labor demand by gender. With a downward sloping labor demand,
GBT has two opposing effects on women’s pre-tax wages, wf . Holding constant women’s career choice ef , an
upward sloping labor supply and a downward sloping labor demand function, imply a fall in pre-tax wages
when τf falls. But as we show below, lowering women’s taxes leads women to choose higher-wage careers ef ,
which endogenously shifts the labor demand upward. This makes the change in pre-tax wages wf theoretically
ambiguous even when labor demand is downward sloping.
14
As we discussed in Section 2, our model extends the models of Manser and Brown (1980) and McElroy and
Horney (1981). Lundberg and Pollak (1993), instead, argue that threat points are internal to the marriage
and can be seen as (possibly inefficient) non-cooperative equilibria of the marriage game. While the literature
is not conclusive as to the most appropriate assumption, we expect the qualitative implications of our model
to go through in this alternative environment. The reason is that tax policy affects outside options similarly
in our model (because GBT is applied to singles as well) and in a model of internal threat points.

8

singles and on own and spouse’s home duties for married in a manner that we specify below.
The linearity of utility with respect to market consumption allows us to obtain analytical
solutions but also has a number of important implications for our results.15 Denoting by α
the returns to scale parameter in the household technology, this utility specification leads to
a wage elasticity of labor supply (see Section 5 for the derivation):


h
∂n w
1
1
1
ǫn,w =

+
∂w n
φ
φ 1−α n

(4)

When h = 0, the elasticity of labor supply is constant (1/φ). Our utility specification
implies that the elasticity of labor supply increases in the ratio of home duties over market
work, h/n. This is a crucial feature of our model. The intuition is that a higher amount of
home duties implies the existence of more (or closer) substitutes towards which time spent in
market work is directed following shocks that affect the returns of working in the two sectors.
As a result, exogenous changes in market wages have larger substitution effects on the labor
supply of the spouse who performs more home duties.
A key result in our model, as we discuss in Section 5, is that the ratio h/n differs across
genders. This happens for two reasons. One is the case in which women have a comparative
advantage in home duties. Because women perform more home duties, their home production
provides a closer substitute to market work and their elasticity of labor supply is higher. The
second is the case in which genders are equally productive in market and home activities
but, because of higher bargaining power, men pursue higher-wage careers than women. The
commitment to a market career with higher wages, longer market hours and less home duties
implies that as the wage changes, men’s labor supply responds less than women’s labor supply.
As an example, consider the case of a man who majors in engineering and a woman who majors
in education. Because the wife gets involved more with home duties, her time at home becomes
a closer substitute to her time in the market relative to the time of her engineer husband.

3.2

Singles

In the equilibrium of our model there will be no singles. But we analyze their choices because
their utility functions are the threat points in the bargaining game. Singles choose market
consumption (csi ), market hours (nsi ) and the amount of home duties (hsi ) to maximize utility:
max Uis = csi + His −

csi ,nsi ,hsi

1
(nsi + hsi )1+φ
1+φ

(5)

15
We discuss below how this assumption affects: (i) the application of the Coase theorem; (ii) the absence
of strategic interaction in the choice of careers; (iii) the distributional goals of the government.

9

subject to the budget constraint:
csi ≤ (1 − τi )wi nsi ei + πi

(6)

and the home production technology:
κi s α
(h )
(7)
α i
There are decreasing returns to scale in home production, i.e. α < 1. The parameter
His ≤

κi > 0 denotes gender-specific productivity in home duties. While we consider a model
of a representative family in which it is optimal to marry, the off-equilibrium utility when
single determines the implicit bargaining power which affects the marriage solution. As Uis
increases, the threat to remain single becomes stronger and spouse i receives higher utility in
the marriage. Because the same tax schedule applies to singles and to married (i.e. τi and πi
are not indexed by s), GBT affects the bargaining positions in the marriage through Uis .

3.3

Married Couple

Men and women each marry if their respective utility in the marriage exceeds their utility
when single. In our model there are two reasons why a couple benefits from marrying. First,
there are economies of scale in the market good. Specifically, for every dollar of income the
family can consume goods that are worth z > 1 dollars.16 Second, married couples enjoy the
provision of a public household good, H, as we describe below.
The family allocates market consumption (cm and cf ), private home goods (Hm and Hf ),
market time (nm and nf ) and home duties (hm and hf ) to maximize the Nash product:
1−γ
s γ
max
Ω = (Um − Um
) Uf − Ufs
(8)
cm ,cf ,nm ,nf ,hm ,hf ,Hm ,Hf

where γ measures the explicit or culturally inherited bargaining power of men. Career costs,
C(ei ), are not included in the marital surplus because they are incurred independently of
marital status (i.e. C(ei ) is sunk). Utility for married is:
1
Ui = ci + (Hi + H) −
(ni + hi )1+φ
1+φ

(9)

where Hi + H denotes total consumption of home goods. The family budget constraint is:17
cm + cf
≤ (1 − τm )wm nm em + (1 − τf )wf nf ef + πm + πf
(10)
z
16

For instance, families reduce costs by sharing a ride to work or by reducing waste in food preparation. See
Nelson (1988) for an analysis of household economies of scale. See Browning, Chiappori and Lewbel (2006)
for a critique of equivalence scales based on the distinction between the unitary and the collective model.
17
Implicit in equation (10) is the assumption that spouses can make side payments. Let l denote a side
payment from the woman to the man. Consider the individual budget constraints when married. For men:
cm /z = (1 − τm )wm nm em + πm + l. For women: cf /z = (1 − τf )wf nf ef + πf − l. Combining these two
equations it is easy to derive the family budget constraint.

10

Equations (11)-(13) below describe the production technology in the home sector. Equation (11) shows how home duties for men (hm ) and women (hf ) combine to produce output
F .18 Equation (12) shows that an exogenous fraction χ of the total product F is allocated to
a public household good H (note that H is non-rival and enters into the utility function of
both spouses in equation (9)). An example of this good is the utility of kids. A fraction 1 − χ
of the total product F is allocated to a private household good (e.g. who eats a larger fraction
of a home made meal). As equation (13) shows, since this good is private, the couple must
decide how to allocate it between the two spouses. In other words, the exogenous parameter
χ ∈ (0, 1] measures the degree of non-rivalry in the consumption of home goods.

The assumption that the marginal products in the home sector are independent from each other is an
important one as it simplifies the solution of the model in a number of ways. First, the solution for home duties
is interior and spouses do not specialize fully. Specialization certainly exists in real world families, but this
would be more natural to study in a model with heterogeneous households. Second, our assumption makes
career choices independent across spouses. As we discuss below such an interdependency would introduce

together with the participation constraints, equations (14) and (15).
In the above system one equation is redundant, as equations (17) and (23) show. In other
words, since preferences are quasi-linear only the sum of private consumption by gender,
ci + Hi , is determined. Equations (18)-(19) and (21)-(22) show that the household optimally
sets the marginal product equal to the marginal disutility of working time in every sector. As
these conditions show, for a predetermined choice of career ei , bargaining power (explicit, γ, or
implicit, Uis ) does not affect the allocation of time across genders and sectors. In the absence
of transaction costs and without wealth effects on labor supply (because of the quasi-linearity
in consumption), the Coase Theorem applies. The household maximizes the “marital pie”
by allocating time according to the first best level. Distributional issues arising from uneven
bargaining power are settled efficiently by appropriate side payments that take the form of
private market consumption or private household consumption (ci + Hi ). However, as we
show below, bargaining power affects the pre-marital choice of career ei . Because ei affects
the allocation of time across genders and sectors, in the end who has the bargaining power
becomes relevant for the organization of the family and ultimately for fiscal policy. The
Proposition below presents the solution of the marriage game.

These solutions are obtained by solving the system of first order conditions for the married
couple, equations (16)-(23), and the corresponding conditions for singles. We note that the
participation constraints hold at optimum and the couple always decides to marry for any tax
policy, i.e. Ui ≥ Uis (see Appendix A.1 for the proof). The reason is that the economies of
scale (z > 1) and the public provision of household goods (χ > 0) enlarge the “marital pie.”
Therefore, both spouses can get more utility than in their respective outside options.

4.2

Optimal Career

Since marriage is optimal, expected utility net of career costs in equation (2) equals utility in
the marriage, Φi = Ui .19 Spouse i chooses a career anticipating the Nash bargaining solution:
max Ωi = Ui (ei ) − C(ei )
ei

(24)

The first order condition is:20

∂Ui (ei )
= C ′ (ei )
(25)
∂ei
The intuition for the career choice can be understood by looking at the derivative of the

utility function Ui in Proposition 1 with respect to ei . Consider the case of men. Choosing a
higher-wage career increases income when married. This effect is:

(29)

Adding equations (26)-(29) and using the first order conditions (18) and (19) to cancel off
terms, we obtain the total effect of a career on men’s utility. A similar reasoning applies for
the case of women. We summarize the choice of optimal career in the Proposition below.21
19

We discuss below some aspects of GBT in a world with singles. See Guner, Kaygusuz and Ventura (2010)
for an interesting dynamic taxation model with an active participation decision, which is calibrated to match
the share of married vs. singles in the US.
20
Below we show that when the elasticity of the marginal cost with respect to the career, E, exceeds the
elasticity of labor supply of married, the function Ωi is strictly concave in ei .
21
The first order condition for spouse i does not involve ej . Thus the “best response functions” are flat and
the equilibrium is unique. This feature of the model follows from the assumptions: (i) lack of wealth effects in
labor supply; (ii) independent marginal products in home and market production; (iii) marriage being optimal
in equilibrium. If preferences were not quasi-linear, the allocation of consumption across spouses would affect
labor supply, which introduces an interdependence in the choice of careers (similarly when the marginal
product of one spouse depends on the work of the other spouse). Careers may also become interrelated when
a random preference shock in the utility of marriage makes the probability of marriage less than one. While
the first two points are mostly technical and we abstract from these for analytical tractability, the last one
is an interesting extension because our model does not allow for singles in equilibrium and thus it does not
take into account possible distortions in the marriage market. We discuss this point in more detail in the
Conclusion.

optimal choice of careers:

where the labor supply of singles relative to married is defined as:
∆i :=

nsi
ni

(32)

Pursuing a higher-wage career increases utility because it increases income when married.
A higher-wage career also increases income when single which matters because it determines
the implicit bargaining power of spouse i and building a career offers outside options which
translate into a higher level of utility when married. For men, these two effects are weighted
by zγnm and (1 − γ)nsm , where z denotes the economies of scale parameter. The weight on
the marriage effect is multiplied by z because married people enjoy economies of scale. The
weight on the marriage effect increases with the explicit bargaining power of men (γ) and
with the labor supply of married men (nm ). The weight on the effect of singles decreases
with the explicit bargaining power of men (γ) and increases with the labor supply of single
men (nsm ). As equation (30) shows, the optimal career equalizes the benefit of pursuing a
higher-wage career to the costs associated with the additional time and effort to acquire skills
and the increased stress in the market. Similar effects apply in the case of women.

Gendered Equilibria

We analyze two broad cases. In the first one women have a comparative advantage in home
production:

κf
wf
>
κm
wm

(33)

This case emerges under a variety of circumstances, such as biological differences in productivity at home (κf > κm with wm = wf ) or differences in market wages (wm > wf with
κm = κf ) as a result of market productivity differences or gender discrimination, or a combination of these. Even though the sectoral allocation of time across genders depends only on
the comparative advantage, who has the absolute advantage is relevant for tax policy because
absolute advantages (wm > wf or κf > κm ) determine the final distribution of utilities across
spouses. We discuss this point in more detail in Section 6.
15

The second case is when, for cultural or historical reasons from a period of time where
physical power mattered, men have higher bargaining power than women:
γ > 1/2

(34)

Assumption 1. Parameters: The parameters z and χ satisfy:
(1 + χ) > z 1+

1−α
φ

> z > ∆i (z, χ) > 1

(35)

where ∆i is the labor supply of singles relative to married as defined in equation (32).
First, we note that ∆i depends on z and χ. In Appendix A.2 we prove that there is an
area of z’s and χ’s such that condition (35) in Assumption 1 holds.
Assumption 1 implies that singles work more than the married in the market (i.e. ∆i > 1)
and that the married take more home duties than the singles (i.e. 1 + χ > z).22 The
inequality (1 + χ) > z 1+

1−α
φ

is a necessary condition for ∆i > 1. The inequality z > ∆i has

the following economic interpretation. When spouse i receives a positive income shock, j’s
utility increases because of the sharing of resources in the marriage. But at the same time,
j’s utility decreases as spouse i acquires implicit bargaining power and appropriates a larger
share of the increased family income. When economies of scale are important with respect to
the labor supply of singles (relative to married), the first effect dominates and both spouses
benefit from the positive income shock (although not equally). As it becomes clear below,
the inequality z > ∆i is crucial for our results.
The following Proposition highlights several implications of our model which are consistent
with the evidence (see e.g. Burda, Hamermesh and Weil, 2007).
Proposition 3. Gendered Equilibria: Suppose that one of the three cases holds: (i) γ >
1/2 with wm = wf and κm = κf ; (ii) wm > wf with γ = 1/2 and κm = κf ; (iii) κf > κm
with γ = 1/2 and wm = wf .23 Suppose also that Assumption 1 holds. Holding constant the
marginal tax rates at some arbitrary level τ = τm = τf , we obtain the following results:
1. Men pursue higher-wage careers than women: em > ef .
2. Men take less home duties than women: hm < hf and hsm < hsf .
22

This assumption seems consistent with the evidence of Burda, Hamermesh and Weil (2007) for the US
(2003) and for Germany (2001-2002).
23
Our results could hold when some of the equalities fail or under a combination of (i), (ii) and (iii) but
for expository reasons we restrict attention to the three extreme cases that isolate the source of the gendered
equilibrium.

16

3. Men work more in the market than women: nm > nf and nsm > nsf .
s
4. Men have a higher marginal product than women in both sectors: qm > qf and qm
> qfs .

5. Marriage amplifies the gender gap in home duties: hf − hm > hsf − hsm .
6. Marriage amplifies the gender gap in market work: nm − nf > nsm − nsf .
7. Men have a lower wage elasticity of labor supply than women: ǫnm ,wm < ǫnf ,wf and
ǫsnm ,wm < ǫsnf ,wf .
8. Singles have a lower wage elasticity of labor supply than married: ǫsni ,wi < ǫni ,wi for
i = m, f .
9. Marriage amplifies the gender gap in wage elasticities of labor supply: ǫnf ,wf − ǫnm ,wm >
ǫsnf ,wf − ǫsnm ,wm .
10. Men have a lower wage elasticity of career than women: ǫem ,wm < ǫef ,wf (for the case of
γ > 1/2 this is subject to the additional Assumption 2 presented below).
We now show how to derive Proposition 3 and give the intuition of these comparative
statics. Consider first the case of γ > 1/2. The key step is to show how for equal marginal
tax rates (τm = τf ), equal exogenous wages (wm = wf ) and equal inherent productivities in
the home sector (κm = κf ), men choose higher-wage careers than women, em > ef . To prove
this result, we note that the first order conditions for the optimal career, equations (30) and
(31), and the solution for labor supply in Proposition 1 imply the symmetric solution em = ef
when γ = 1/2. Differentiating implicitly men’s first order condition for the optimal career,
equation (30), and using Assumption 1 (note that z > ∆i is necessary and sufficient):
∂em
∂ 2 Um
∝
= (1 − τm )wm nm (z − ∆m ) > 0
∂γ
∂em ∂γ

(36)

For women an analogous argument shows that ef decreases in γ. As a result, when γ > 1/2
we take em > ef . The intuition is that higher-wage careers enlarge the size of the “marital
pie” to be divided between spouses. The stronger are the economies of scale, the larger is
the increase of the total pie. When men have more bargaining power, they anticipate to
appropriate a larger share of the enlarged pie and therefore their incentive to pursue higherwage careers increases. But choosing a higher-wage career before marriage also increases
the value of remaining single, thus increasing the implicit bargaining power.24 As a result,
24

Pollak (2007) argues convincingly that the wage rate and implicitly the level of human capital should
determine the outside option of a spouse. Our model addresses this concern in the literature.

17

women tend to choose a higher-wage career to offset their lower explicit bargaining power.
The marriage effect dominates the outside option effect when economies of scale are large
with respect to the labor market participation of singles relative to married (z > ∆i ). The
latter matters because the value of the outside option increases when, off-equilibrium, singles
threat to work more in the market.
Because em > ef , the solution to the Nash bargaining program presented in Proposition
1 implies that men take less home duties than women, hm < hf and hsm < hsf . In our model,
home duties and participation in the market are Beckerian (1985) substitutes. To see this,
consider the first order conditions (18) and (21) for the optimal supply of labor for married
couples:
qi := (ni + hi )φ = z(1 − τi )wi ei

(37)

This condition shows how, for given level of taxes and effective wages, market hours offset
one to one home hours.25 It follows that if men assume less home duties, then they work more
at the market nm > nf , both because of a higher em and because of a lower hm . Equation (37)
also shows that men have a higher marginal product than women in every sector, qm > qf , a
result that follows from the assumption that the home sector is subject to decreasing returns
s
to scale. A similar argument applies for the case of singles, nsm > nsf and qm
> qfs .

Next, we show how the marriage decision amplifies gender differences in the allocation of
time. This result is consistent with the time use evidence in Burda, Hamermesh and Weil
(2007). For the amount of home duties, using the solutions in Proposition 1 we obtain:
hf − hm =



1+χ
z

1
 1−α

hsf − hsm



(38)

Using Assumption 1, the term [(1 + χ)/z]1/(1−α) is greater than unity. Therefore, it amplifies the difference in the amount of home duties across genders, i.e. hf − hm > hsf − hsm .
For the working time in the market we have:

(39)

Because z > 1 and because the bracketed term in the right-hand side of (39) is positive,
nm − nf > nsm + nsf .26 Intuitively, the gender gap in the allocation of time is amplified inside
the marriage because the economies of scale in private consumption and the public provision
25

Aguiar and Hurst (2007) and Burda, Hamermesh and Weil (2007) document that in developed countries
like the US, men and women take a similar amount of total work. In other words, higher home work, rather
an increased time spent in leisure, tends to primarily offset a lower market participation.
26
That the bracketed term is positive follows by substituting hf − hm from equation (38) into the bracketed
term of equation (39) and then using Assumption 1.

of home goods, which take place only when married, make the returns to partial specialization
higher for married people than for singles.
The elasticity of labor supply is derived as follows. Using the first order conditions for the
labor supply of married, equations (18) and (21), we take:

Equations (42) and (43) show that women’s wage elasticity of labor supply is higher since
women take more home duties and work less than men in the market. Moreover, the elasticity
is lower for singles than for married because by Assumption 1 we have hsi /nsi < hi /ni .
The model also predicts that the decision to marry amplifies the gender elasticity difference, ǫnf ,wf − ǫnm ,wm > ǫsnf ,wf − ǫsnm ,wm , which is consistent with the fact that the gender
gap in the labor supply elasticities seems to be driven by married women (Blau and Kahn,
2007). The intuition for the result that marriage amplifies the gender gap in labor supply
elasticities follows from the fact that the elasticity of labor supply is increasing in the ratio
of home duties to market work, in conjunction with the result that marriage amplifies the
gender differences in market work and home duties. The proof is presented in Appendix A.3.
Finally, consider the elasticity of men’s and women’s career decision. For men and women
we obtain respectively (see Appendix A.4 for the derivation):27
ǫem ,wm

γz(1 + ǫnm ,wm ) + (1 − γ)∆m (1 + ǫsnm ,wm )
=
γz(E − ǫnm ,wm ) + (1 − γ)∆m (E − ǫsnm ,wm )

27

(44)

These formulas follow from an application of the Implicit Function Theorem and show that the objective
function Ωi = Ui (ei ) − C(ei ) is strictly concave in ei whenever E exceeds the elasticities of labor supply. In
this case the denominators in equations (44) and (45) are positive.

19

ǫef ,wf =

(1 − γ)z(1 + ǫnf ,wf ) + γ∆f (1 + ǫsnf ,wf )
(1 − γ)z(E − ǫnf ,wf ) + γ∆f (E − ǫsnf ,wf )

(45)

where E = C ′′ e/C ′ denotes the elasticity of the marginal cost of careers. Intuitively, the
decision to pursue a career precedes the marriage decision. As a result, the elasticity of
pursuing a career in the market sector becomes a weighted average of the elasticity of labor
supply when married and the elasticity of labor supply when single.
As we discuss in the next Section and prove in Appendix A.7, the elasticity of careers
is increasing in the marginal tax rate τi , i.e. it is decreasing in the effective wage wi ei
and increasing in the home productivity parameter κi , for any γ. Therefore, when gender
differences derive solely from comparative advantage, ǫem ,wm < ǫef ,wf . In anticipation of a
higher labor supply elasticity when married or single, women’s career decision becomes more
sensitive to exogenous changes in the wage.
For the case of γ > 1/2, there are two opposing effects. The fact that men choose higherwage careers than women (em > ef ) implies, similarly to the comparative advantage case, that
ǫem ,wm < ǫef ,wf . But in this case there is also a compositional effect because, as equations
(44) and (45) show, as γ increases, men’s elasticity puts more weight on the labor supply
elasticity of married, while women’s elasticity puts more weight on the labor supply elasticity
of singles. Because singles have a less elastic labor supply than married, this effect tends to
increase ǫem ,wm and to decrease ǫef ,wf . For the case of γ > 1/2, an intuitive sufficient condition
for ǫem ,wm < ǫef ,wf is that the labor supply of married men is less elastic than the labor supply
of single women.28
Assumption 2. Married Men vs. Single Women: Married men’s labor supply is less
elastic than single women’s labor supply: ǫnm ,wm < ǫsnf ,wf .
We do not solve explicitly for the parameters that satisfy this condition because the
ratios hm /nm and the hsf /nsf depend on the unspecified cost function C(e). Rather, we
cite some evidence that points out that this assumption is likely to be satisfied. Burda,
Hamermesh and Weil (2007) find hm /nm = 0.54 < hsf /nsf = 0.97 for the US (2003) and
hm /nm = 0.64 < hsf /nsf = 1.50 for Germany (2001-2002). According to equations (42) and
(43) this implies ǫnm ,wm < ǫsnf ,wf . And in fact, Blau and Kahn (2007) estimate wage elasticities
for single women that range from 0.43 to 0.59 in 1980 and then fall to 0.15 to 0.28 by 2000.
For married men, the authors find wage elasticities that range from 0.01 to 0.07 in 1980 and
from 0.05 to 0.10 in 2000.
This follows from the following observation. Since ǫnm ,wm > ǫsnm ,wm , the upper bound for ǫem ,wm must
be (1 + ǫnm ,wm )/(E − ǫnm ,wm ). Similarly, the lower bound for ǫef ,wf is (1 + ǫsnf ,wf )/(E − ǫsnf ,wf ). These cases
are obtained under γ = 1.
28

20

To save space we do not analyze separately the cases of wm > wf and κf > κm . We note
that in these cases there is the direct, exogenous effect of comparative advantage but there is
also an indirect, endogenous effect coming from the fact that em > ef . These effects can be
analyzed easily by following the same arguments as for γ > 1/2 case. The only exception is
the result ǫem ,wm < ǫef ,wf for which, as discussed above, Assumption 2 is not necessary.

Gender-Based Taxation

The social planner chooses gender-specific linear tax schedules to maximize social welfare:
max

τm ,πm ,τf ,πf

W = ωV (Um − C(em )) + (1 − ω)V (Uf − C(ef ))

(46)

The function V (.) satisfies V ′ > 0 and V ′′ < 0 and is symmetric across genders.29 Potential
asymmetries across genders are captured by allowing ω 6= 1/2. The problem is subject to the
government’s budget constraint:
Tm + Tf = τm wm nm em + τf wf nf ef − πm − πf ≥ G

(47)

With an important exception discussed below, lump sum taxes, πi < 0, are excluded
because in this case the planner could trivially raise revenues without distortions to finance
G. Gender-specific lump sum transfers, πi ≥ 0, play a non-trivial role, despite the fact that
spouses can make side payments. Because the bargaining outcome depends on the utility of
singles, gender-specific lump sum transfers (given also to singles) affect the distribution of
consumption and utility in the marriage by changing the implicit bargaining powers.30
Attaching multiplier λ to the government budget constraint, the first order conditions of
the planning program are given by (with the definition Vi′ := V ′ (Ui − C(ei ))):

The concavity of the V (.) function introduces utilitarian motives in government’s objective despite the
lack of curvature in the primitive utility function.
30
In the unitary model or in a model in which the couple maximizes a weighted average of utilities without
reference to the outside options of the spouses, the pooling of resources implies that only the sum of the
transfers πm + πf is determined and not the gender-specific transfer πi . Lundberg, Pollak and Wales (1997)
discuss a natural experiment in the UK which strongly rejects this implication of the unitary model.

Equations (48) and (49) show that in an interior equilibrium (τi > 0) the planner equalizes
the social marginal utility cost of higher marginal tax rates to the social value of an extra
dollar of revenues raised by higher taxes for every gender i = m, f . Equations (50) and (51)
are the corresponding conditions for the lump sum transfers and equation (52) is the budget
constraint. Because utility is decreasing in marginal tax rates and increasing in transfers, the
budget constraint binds at optimum and λ > 0.
We also consider the case of “purely redistributive” lump sum transfers, namely we allow
for a lump sum tax to spouse i, πi < 0, as long as this is not used to finance G without
distortions. Instead, the revenue raised by this tax is given to spouse j as a lump sum
transfer. In other words, we leave the sign of πi unrestricted but we require that πm + πf = 0.
This case is interesting because, as we argue below, it shows the desirability of GBT on
efficiency grounds only, that is after all distributional concerns have been resolved efficiently
by the society.
First, we derive the response of welfare and revenues to taxes. Second, we present the
solution for the lump sum transfers as a function of society’s desire to redistribute wealth
across genders. Third, we prove the optimality of GBT with τm > τf when society’s marginal
cost of taxing men is equal to (or smaller than) society’s marginal cost of taxing women.
Finally, we discuss some further implications of GBT.

but from the planner’s point of view ei is elastic.

∂πm
Higher marginal tax rates decrease income both inside and outside the marriage. These
effects are weighted by γz and (1 − γ)∆m respectively. In addition, higher taxes distort the
incentive to choose a higher-wage career and this cost increases with (the absolute value of)
the elasticity of a career with respect to taxes, ǫem ,τm . A lump sum transfer increases utility
by z inside the marriage and by 1 when single. These effects are weighted with γ and 1 − γ
respectively. The effects of higher women’s taxes on men’s utility are:

Men’s utility decreases with women’s taxes because total family income decreases and

spouses share resources. Men’s utility increases with women’s taxes because women’s outside
option deteriorates which implies an increase in the implicit bargaining power of men who
appropriate a larger share of family’s income. As explained in Assumption 1, when economies
of scale are relatively important (z > ∆f ), the first effect dominates and men’s utility decreases
with women’s marginal tax rate. A similar intuition holds for the lump sum transfer. For
women the corresponding effects are:

Finally, for the case of purely redistributive transfers across spouses, we set π = πf and

π = −πm , so that a positive π denotes a lump sum transfer from the man to the woman.
Total family income does not respond to the purely redistributive transfer but the outside
options change with π and as a result the government can affect the final allocation of utilities
in the marriage. It is easy to show that ∂Um /∂π = −1 and ∂Uf /∂π = 1. Because this is a
budget-neutral redistributive policy, government’s net revenues remain constant.

6.2

Lump Sum Transfers

We analyze five cases. Lump sum transfers to both spouses are never optimal. If the planner
favors one of the spouses extremely, then this spouse receives a lump sum transfer and faces
zero marginal tax rates. Which of these cases is optimal depends on the weight ω, the
curvature of V (.) and the deeper determinant of the gendered equilibrium. In addition, we
show how purely redistributive transfers across spouses are chosen to equalize their social
marginal utilities, leaving the efficiency aspects of GBT unaffected. In Section 6.3 we analyze
this case which leads to interior solutions.
6.2.1

Lump Sum Transfers to Both Spouses: πm > 0 and πf > 0

This case is impossible. The intuition is that the planner satisfies any redistributive motive
by giving a lump sum transfer either to the man or to the woman. Giving lump sum transfers
to both spouses does not improve the distribution of utilities (since the planner can always
give a smaller transfer to one spouse and no transfer to the other) and creates distortions
because these transfers must be financed with higher marginal tax rates. The formal proof is
in Appendix A.5.
6.2.2

Lump Sum Transfers Only to Men: πm > 0 and πf = 0

If πm > 0 then τm = 0. Since G + πm > 0, it follows that the planner sets τf > 0. The
intuition is that when the planner favors men extremely (e.g. if ω is very high), the efficient
way to redistribute wealth in favor of men is to set their marginal tax rate equal to zero.
Setting τm > 0 would increase revenues but these extra revenues (given back to men) would
create more distortions. As a result, the planner uses women’s marginal tax rate to finance
G and men’s transfers. The formal proof is in Appendix A.6.
6.2.3

Lump Sum Transfers Only to Women: πf > 0 and πm = 0

This case is symmetric to the previous case. If society’s weight on women is relatively high,
then τf = 0 and τm > 0 is the efficient way to redistribute wealth in favor of women.
6.2.4

No Lump Sum Transfers: πf = 0 and πm = 0

This case is obtained when society’s cost of raising funds is high relative to the motive to
redistribute wealth:

λ > max (γz + (1 − γ))ωVm′ + (1 − γ)(z − 1)(1 − ω)Vf′ , γ(z − 1)ωVm′ + (z(1 − γ) + γ)(1 − ω)Vf′
24

In this case both marginal taxes will, in general, be positive. Using the derivations in
Section 6.1, we can combine the first order conditions (48) and (49) and write the following
expression that determines the optimal tax treatment of the family:
(γz + (1 − γ)∆m ) ωVm′ + (1 − γ)(z − ∆m ) (1 + ǫem ,wm ) (1 − ω)Vf′


γ(z − ∆f ) 1 + ǫef ,wf ωVm′ + ((1 − γ)z + γ∆f )(1 − ω)Vf′

(65)

The optimal marginal tax rates equalize the (men to women) relative marginal cost of
taxation (left-hand side) to the relative marginal revenue from increasing tax rates (righthand side). Our proof in Section 6.3 that the planner optimally sets τm > τf applies to
this case as well whenever the left-hand side of equation (65) does not exceed unity (this
condition is only sufficient and not necessary). In other words, GBT with higher taxes on
men is optimal when the marginal cost of taxing men is equal to (or is smaller than) the
marginal cost of taxing women. More in general, in this case the solution for the marginal
tax rates depends not only on the efficiency aspects of differential taxation, but also on the
planner’s weight on men ω and the curvature of the V (.) function. That is, in the absence of
lump sum transfers, distributional considerations become important in the determination of
the optimal marginal tax rates. Instead of analyzing this case which mixes distributional and
efficiency considerations, we now focus on the case in which the planner can use lump sum
transfers across spouses to satisfy any distributional motive efficiently.
6.2.5

Redistributive Transfers Across Spouses: πm = −πf

Using the results of Section 6.1 on equations (50) and (51), in this case we obtain an equalization of the social marginal utilities:
ωVm′ = (1 − ω)Vf′

(66)

Using equation (66) on the first order conditions (48) and (49), we obtain the key condition
that determines the optimal tax treatment of the family:
τm
(ǫem ,wm + ǫnm ,wm + ǫnm ,wm ǫem ,wm )

(67)

While different marginal tax rates across genders also redistribute wealth, equation (66)
shows that the lump sum transfer from the one spouse to the other always adjusts optimally
to equalize their social marginal utilities.
25

6.3

Optimal Gender-Based Taxation

When the planner optimally redistributes wealth using condition (66), the slopes of the tax
schedule depend only on the efficiency properties of differential taxation. Equation (67)
characterizes the trade-off between the relative marginal cost of increasing men’s marginal
tax rate (left-hand side) versus the relative marginal revenue from taxing men on a higher
marginal tax rate (right-hand side). This equation, however, does not provide an explicit
solution for τm (as a function of τf ) because GBT endogenously changes the career decisions,
the allocation of home duties and market work and the elasticities of labor supply. In other
words, equation (67) is a fixed point problem.
To proceed, fix women’s marginal tax rate at some arbitrary level τf = τ > 0 and set
τm = x + τ , i.e. x ∈ (−τ, 1 − τ ) is the gender difference in the marginal tax rates. We are
looking for a fixed point of equation (67), call it x(τ ). GBT with higher taxes for men is
optimal when the fixed point satisfies x(τ ) > 0 for all τ > 0.32
Proposition 4. Gender-Based Taxation: Suppose that one of the three cases holds: (i)
γ > 1/2 with wm = wf and κm = κf ; (ii) wm > wf with γ = 1/2 and κm = κf ; (iii)
κf > κm with γ = 1/2 and wm = wf .33 Under Assumptions 1 and 2, equation (66) and
the regularity condition that the relative marginal cost of taxation does not exceed the relative
marginal revenue of taxation at the single tax rate (x = 0), GBT with higher marginal tax
rates on men is optimal: x(τ ) > 0.
Assumptions 1 and 2 yield the gendered equilibrium described in Proposition 3 for the
case of non-differential taxation by gender. Equation (66) says that we can focus only on the
efficiency aspects of GBT, with the lump sum transfer adjusting to satisfy any distributional
consideration. Finally, as we discuss below, the regularity condition is relatively mild and it
is likely to hold.
To prove the Proposition, we first consider the right-hand side of equation (67) which gives
the relative marginal revenue as a function of the gender difference in marginal tax rates:
M R(x; τ ) =
32

1−

τ +x
1−τ −x

(ǫem ,wm (x; τ ) + ǫnm ,wm (x; τ ) + ǫnm ,wm (x; τ )ǫem ,wm (x; τ ))

τ
1 − 1−τ
ǫef ,wf (τ ) + ǫnf ,wf (τ ) + ǫnf ,wf (τ )ǫef ,wf (τ )

(68)

As we show below, x(τ ) is a function, i.e. the solution is unique. After x(τ ) is known, we can plug this
equation back to the government’s budget constraint and check if the constraint is satisfied. If revenues are
lower than G, then we increase τ and the opposite when revenues are higher than G. In other words, τ will
depend on the exogenous level of G. This procedure defines another fixed point problem which can be shown
to converge whenever it starts from the upward sloping part of the Laffer curve. Since utility decreases in the
marginal tax rates, the planner will never choose a τ and a x(τ ) on the “wrong side” of the Laffer curve.
33
The same comment following Proposition 3 applies. While we focus only on the three extreme cases that
isolate the source of the gendered equilibrium, Proposition 4 can be extended to a combination of cases.

26

First, we note here and prove in Appendix A.7 that the career elasticity, ǫem ,wm , increases
in men’s taxes τ + x. Similarly to the case of taxes, we can show that the career elasticity
decreases in the effective wage wm em and increases in the home productivity parameter κm , for
any γ. This result verifies the claim in Section 5 that, for equal taxes, men have a less elastic
career decision than women whenever gender differences derive from comparative advantage.
Because the wage elasticity of labor supply increases in the ratio of home duties over market
hours as shown in equation (42) and because the ratio of home duties over market work is
an increasing function of the tax rate as shown in Proposition 1, the labor supply elasticity,
ǫnm ,wm (x; τ ), in equation (68) increases in x. Given that the career elasticity, ǫem ,wm (x; τ ),
also increases in men’s tax rate, the relative marginal revenue function M R(x; τ ) is a strictly
decreasing function of x, for any τ > 0. In addition, the relative marginal revenue exceeds
unity at the point of non-differential taxation by gender, i.e. M R(x = 0, τ ) > 1, for any τ > 0.
In other words, at the single tax rate, raising tax revenues from men is easier than raising
revenues from women, which is the “Ramsey inverse elasticity rule.” This holds because for
equal marginal tax rates, men have a less elastic labor supply and career decision than women
as discussed in Proposition 3.34 The function M R(x; τ ) is depicted in Figure 1.
Consider the left-hand side of equation (67), which gives the relative marginal cost of
taxing men:
M C(x; τ ) =

z + (1 − γ)(z − ∆m (x; τ ))ǫem ,wm (x; τ )
z + γ(z − ∆f (τ ))ǫef ,wf (τ )

(69)

If there was no career decision or if the career decision was inelastic, then the relative
marginal cost would always equal unity. This is because the planner can redistribute wealth
across spouses without distortions according to equation (66), which implies that the utility
costs of higher marginal tax rates must be equalized across genders. As we discuss below, in
that case x(τ ) > 0 is optimal. An elastic career decision introduces a complication because
spouses do not internalize the effects of their career decision on their spouse’s utility. This
is captured by the last term of the numerator (for the case of men) and the last term of the
denominator (for the case of women) in equation (69). Higher tax rates for men distort their
decision to pursue higher-wage careers. This, on the one hand, decreases the utility of women
because there is sharing inside the family but, on their other hand, this increases women’s
utility because the relative bargaining power of women increases when men pursue lower-wage
careers. As explained in Assumption 1, z > ∆m implies that the first effect dominates and
34

Looking at equation (68), we see that Assumption 2 is clearly not necessary for our argument. Even when
ǫef ,wf > ǫem ,wm , the marginal revenue function is likely to be greater than unity at the point of non-differential
taxation because of the gender difference in labor supply elasticities.

27

that higher tax rates for men introduce a further utility cost for the society.
When the planner contemplates an increase in the marginal tax rate of men relative
to women, x, the relative marginal cost tends to increase because men’s career elasticity,
ǫem ,wm (x), increases. As a result, women’s utility falls faster in the marriage. But on the
other hand, the relative marginal cost tends to decrease because the weight on the outside
option effect tends to increase (∆m (x) increases in x). Intuitively, singles have a less responsive
labor supply than married and as a result the outside option effect receives a larger weight
because the off-equilibrium threat of becoming single (and working more) becomes stronger.
In Appendix A.8 we show that M R′ (x; τ ) − M C ′ (x; τ ) < 0 for any τ > 0, i.e. the M C(x)
function cuts the M R(x) function from below. This implies that equation (67) has a unique
fixed point x(τ ). As a result, we obtain x(τ ) > 0 if at the point of non-differential taxation
by gender, the relative marginal revenue exceeds the relative marginal cost, M R(x = 0; τ ) >
M C(x = 0; τ ), which is the regularity condition presented above. Figure 1 depicts this
situation. This condition is very likely to hold. It always holds when γ is sufficiently high.
A quick intuition of this result can be obtained by looking at the limiting case γ = 1, i.e.
when men make take-it-or-leave-it offers to women, in which case the relative marginal cost
function is always smaller than unity, M C(x; τ ) < 1. The regularity condition also holds
when career is sufficiently inelastic or in a model without a career decision. For the intuition
note, as discussed above, that with inelastic careers and optimal redistributive transfers we
obtain an equalization of the marginal costs of taxation by gender, M C(x; τ ) = 1. When γ is
relatively low and careers are elastic, x(τ ) > 0 is optimal under mild additional conditions.35
To summarize, when the relative marginal cost of taxing men is smaller than the relative
marginal revenue from taxing men at the point of non-differential taxation, τm > τf is optimal.
Since, by the Ramsey inverse elasticity rule, the relative marginal revenue from taxing men
exceeds unity at the single tax rate, τm > τf is optimal whenever society’s marginal cost
of taxing men is equal to (or smaller than) society’s marginal cost of taxing women. This
condition is also sufficient for τm > τf in the case of πm = πf = 0 in equation (65).

6.4

Discussion and Further Implications of GBT

Under the conditions of Proposition 4, the specific assumption that generates a gendered
equilibrium, i.e. whether γ > 1/2 or wm > wf or κf > κm , does not matter for the result
35

We verify numerically that x(τ ) > 0 is almost always optimal. One, for instance, condition that generates
x(τ ) > 0 is that G is not trivially low relative to total income in the economy. Another condition is that
singles are not too different from married because in this case the increase of ∆m in equation (69) is dominated
by the increase of ǫem ,wm .

28

τm > τf . However, the deeper determinant of the gendered equilibrium matters for the
redistributive part of taxation, i.e. for equation (66). For instance, when γ > 1/2 but the
social planner weights men and women equally (ω = 1/2), there is a “social dissonance”
(Apps and Rees 1988) between society’s preferences and the result of the bargaining game in
which men have more bargaining power than women. In the case of uneven bargaining power,
the planner in general transfers resources lump sum from men to women to ameliorate the
social dissonance. A second case arises when ω is close to 1/2, but women have comparative
advantage in home duties. Gender differences in wages (wm > wf ) imply a lump sum transfer
from men to women.36 Interestingly, the case of κf > κm implies a lump sum transfer from
women to men, but as Proposition 4 shows, it also implies higher marginal tax rates on men.
Put it differently, in this case the planner transfers resources lump sum to men to offset
the absolute advantage of women and then taxes them on a higher marginal tax schedule to
minimize distortions because men have lower labor supply elasticities.
GBT changes endogenously the intrafamily bargaining solution. Following the same reasoning that leads to Proposition 3 we conclude that, because of GBT, the allocation of home
duties and market opportunities becomes more balanced across genders, women start to pursue higher-wage careers and the elasticities of labor supply start to converge, relative to a
system with a single tax rate. Therefore, to the extent that the society values the social goal of
promoting women’s employment in the market, as so many other gender policies show, GBT
offers this additional benefit. However, we have not considered some potential costs. One case
arises when κf > κm and there are increasing returns to home production (α > 1). If, after
GBT is implemented, women work more in the market and men take more home production
(for instance, due to a change in the pattern of specialization within the household), there
could be welfare losses from the less efficient production of the household good. In principle,
the same argument can be raised if one believes that there are increasing returns in the market sector. An additional potential cost of GBT would arise in the case of self-employed, if
differential taxation induces couples to shift taxable income from one spouse to the other. In
turn, existence of such possibilities for the self-employed, may distort occupational choices.
The idea that GBT endogenously balances the allocation of work across genders may
have additional implications in a dynamic extension of the model. If one believes that men
and women are biologically identical in their market and home productivity, and with the
possible exception of women’s comparative advantage in early child development there is no
36

This assumes that the gender difference in the marginal tax rates is not so large to reverse the gap in the
social marginal utilities. A similar comment applies to the cases γ > 1/2 and κf > κm .

29

reason not to believe so, then gender differences originating within the family will be entirely
attributed to cultural or historical factors that favor the man. When the explicit bargaining
power of men, γ, evolves endogenously as a result of a cultural transmission that arises from
the internal organization of the family and society’s perceptions regarding gender roles, one
would expect that the initial implementation of GBT leads to a long-run equilibrium with no
gender differences and as a result no need to use GBT.

7

Concluding Remarks

In this paper we begin to analyze the effects of Gender-Based Taxation as a potential tax
policy. We consider two cases for the organization of the family. In the first case, men
and women have different labor supplies because women have a comparative advantage in
performing home duties. In the second case, for cultural reasons the intrafamily bargaining
process favors the husband. When society can use lump sum transfers to redistribute wealth
efficiently across genders, the marginal tax rates are set to minimize labor market distortions.
GBT with lower marginal tax rates for women is, under mild conditions, superior to an
ungendered tax rate, independently of the deeper reason that sustains a gendered equilibrium
which matters only for the redistributive properties of taxation. In what we call the “longrun,” spouses react to GBT and as a result the allocation of household duties and labor
market opportunities becomes more balanced and the gender gap in labor supplies elasticities
becomes smaller.
Rather than reviewing in more detail our results it is worth discussing several important
avenues for future research. First, our model does not allow for a realistic marriage market
since it considers a society in which marriage is optimal for everybody along the equilibrium
path. A proper discussion of the marriage market would require the introduction of some
heterogeneity within the pool of men and women and the consideration of a matching or
a searching model. An evaluation of these more complicated tax structures would depend
undoubtedly on their redistributive properties in a world of heterogeneous households.
Second, we have considered gender-specific tax schedules that apply regardless of marital
status. This is a quite different policy from one which taxes differentially only married men
and women because, in our case, the government can affect the bargaining positions of spouses
through changes in their outside options. Alternatively, if we allowed for different tax rates
not only across genders but also within genders by differentiating between singles and married,
our model suggests that the government could directly offset the bargaining power of men by

30

taxing single men at a higher rate.
Third, our model assumes the structure of the tax instruments as in the Ramsey tradition.
Our family model could contribute to the Mirrlees optimum income tax problem, as the
elasticity of labor supply and the distribution of wages are key determinants in that model
too. The tax policy part of our model would benefit from an analysis closer to that of Mirrlees
as the policy of differential taxation by gender redistributes not only within households but
also across households.
Fourth, our model does not distinguish between the intensive and extensive margin of the
labor supply decision. Note that in a model in which women have a more elastic participation
margin, gender-specific transfers conditional on market participation have efficiency benefits
similar to the benefits of gender-specific marginal tax rates in our model with an intensive
margin of labor supply.
Fifth, we have not allowed for the fact that certain chores (but probably not all, at least
for most families) can be purchased in the market. Sixth, for the political economy of GBT
it is crucial to allow for lump sum transfers that compensate the losers and model explicitly
how singles react to differential taxation by gender. Seventh, a quantitative evaluation of
GBT can shed more light on the welfare effects of differential taxation. This exercise would
require a richer framework in which we allow for elasticity effects on the extensive margin of
labor supply and income effects on women’s labor supply.
Finally, a comparison of GBT with other gender and family policies, such as quotas,
affirmative action, forced parental leave and public supply of services to families, is necessary
within a unified theoretical framework in order to draw policy conclusions. Many types of
quantity interventions we observe in practice may be more distortionary and less well targeted
at addressing problems which can be addressed by GBT. We see no reason why GBT should
not be a favorite “horse” in a race with all these alternative policies, but we still have to run
it.

similar reasoning shows that the second parenthesis in the right-hand side of equation (A.1)
is also positive when evaluated at the singles’ solution. It follows that a positive surplus for
both spouses is feasible even if the family does not reoptimize. Therefore, after the family
optimizes the Nash product, both partners will derive utility that (weakly) exceeds the utility
of singles.

We verify that there is an area of z’s and χ’s such that condition (35) in Assumption 1

As a result, z > ∆i > 1 holds when L(z) < ris (z) < R(z). For z = 1 we obtain ris (1) >
L(1) = R(1) = 0. Using Proposition 1, we see that as z increases, labor supply nsi increases
and the amount of home duties hsi falls. Therefore, ris (z) = hsi /nsi is a decreasing function of
z. In addition, because K(z) is a decreasing function of z, both R(z) and L(z) are increasing
functions of z. Because R(z) > L(z) for all z > 1, R(z) must grow faster than L(z) when z
increases. When K(z) approaches zero, which is the case of (1 + χ) = z 1+

in Assumption

1, R(z) and L(z) approach infinity. Since ris (z) is positive at z = 1 and then decreases and
since R(z) and L(z) are zero at z = 1 and then increase without bounds with R(z) > L(z), it
follows that there exists an area of z’s such that the condition z > ∆i > 1 holds. In addition,
because ris (z) is finite, this area always has the property that z 1+

with Assumption 1.

Proof that Marriage Amplifies the Gender Gap in Elasticities

We need to show that ǫnf ,wf − ǫsnf ,wf > ǫnm ,wm − ǫsnm ,wm . Substituting the formulas for the
elasticities of labor supply from equations (42) and (43) we need to show that:

(A.9)

Factoring out nsi from both sides of inequality (A.9) and using the fact that nsm > nsf , it
is sufficient to show that:
hf ∆f − hsf > hm ∆m − hsm

(A.10)

(hf − hsf ) + hf (∆f − 1) > (hm − hsm ) + hm (∆m − 1)

(A.11)

or that:

Since the gender gap in home duties is greater for married couples than for singles (shown
in Proposition 3), the first term in the left-hand side of inequality (A.11) is greater than the
first term in the right-hand side of inequality (A.11). The second term in the left-hand side
of inequality (A.11) is also greater than the second term in the right-hand side of inequality
(A.11) because ∆f > ∆m and hf > hm . This completes the proof.

In deriving equation (A.13) we have used the definition of the elasticity of the marginal
cost of careers, E = C ′′ e/C ′ .37 The next step is to substitute out from the denominator of
equation (A.13) the term C ′ using the first order condition for the optimal career, equation
(30), and to collect terms. This leads to:

(A.14)

Finally, factoring out nm from the numerator and the denominator, using the definition
of ∆m := nsm /nm and simplifying, we obtain:

(A.15)

Multiplying both sides of equation (A.15) by wm /em leads to equation (44). A similar
derivation leads to equation (45) for women.
37

Note that we have also used ǫnm ,wm = ǫnm ,em .

A.5

Excluding πm > 0 and πf > 0

Using the results of Section 6.1, we can write the first order conditions (50) and (51) respectively as:
λ = (γz + (1 − γ))ωVm′ + (1 − γ)(z − 1)(1 − ω)Vf′

(A.16)

λ = γ(z − 1)ωVm′ + (z(1 − γ) + γ)(1 − ω)Vf′

(A.17)

Combining equations (A.16) and (A.17) we obtain:
λ
= (1 − ω)Vf′ = ωVm′
z

(A.18)

We show that lump sum transfers cannot be positive for both spouses. Using the results
of Section 6.1 and equation (A.18), we write the first order condition for the optimal τm ,
equation (48), and the first order condition for the optimal τf , equation (49), as:
− (1 − γ)(z − ∆m )

1 − τm

(A.19)
(A.20)

Since all tax elasticities are negative and all wage elasticities are positive, equations (A.19)
and (A.20) hold with strict inequality, i.e. τm = τf = 0 (this also holds when careers are
inelastic). But when marginal tax rates are set equal to zero, it is impossible to finance G > 0
and the transfers. Therefore, this case is excluded.

A.6

Proof that when πm > 0 and πf = 0 then τm = 0 and τf > 0

When πm > 0, the first order conditions (50) and (51) become respectively:
λ > γ(z − 1)ωVm′ + (z(1 − γ) + γ)(1 − ω)Vf′

(A.21)

λ = (γz + (1 − γ))(1 − ω)Vm′ + (1 − γ)(z − 1)(1 − ω)Vf′

(A.22)

Combining equations (A.21) and (A.22) we obtain:
ωVm′ > λ = (γz + (1 − γ))ωVm′ + (1 − γ)(z − 1)(1 − ω)Vf′ > (1 − ω)Vf′

(A.23)

Under equation (A.23), the first order condition for τm , equation (48), becomes equation
(A.19). Since all tax elasticities are negative and all wage elasticities are positive, we obtain
τm = 0. Since G + πm > 0, it follows that the planner sets τf > 0.

Proof that the Career Elasticity Increases in the Marginal Tax
Rate

(A.24)

where ǫ′nm ,wm denotes the derivative of married men’s wage elasticity of labor supply with
respect to the tax rate τ + x and (ǫsnm ,wm )′ is the derivative of single men’s wage elasticity of
labor supply with respect to the tax rate.
Rearranging equation (A.24), the career elasticity increases in the marginal tax rate when:

We claim that inequality (A.25) holds true. To see this, first note that because the wage
elasticity of labor supply increases in the ratio of home duties over market hours and because
′
this ratio is increasing in the tax rate, we obtain ǫ′nm ,wm > 0 and ǫsnm ,wm > 0. Therefore,
the left-hand side of inequality (A.25) is positive. Second, we note that the right-hand side
of the inequality is negative. To verify this one needs to simply use the formulas:

Proof that M C(x) Cuts M R(x) from Below

Define the function:
J(x; τ ) = M R(x; τ ) − M C(x; τ )

(A.26)

where M R(x; τ ) is given by equation (68) and M C(x; τ ) is given by equation (69). We will
show that the function J(x; τ ) is decreasing in x for any τ ≥ 0. We define the terms:
H(τ ) = z + γ(z − ∆f (τ ))ǫef ,wf (τ )
36

(A.27)

L(τ ) = 1 −


τ
ǫef ,wf (τ ) + ǫnf ,wf (τ ) + ǫef ,wf (τ )ǫnf ,wf (τ )
1−τ

(A.28)

Note that these terms depend only on τ and not on x. From Assumption 1 (z > ∆f ) we
note that H(τ ) > z. We also have 0 < L(τ ) ≤ 1 because all elasticities are positive (L(τ ) ≤ 1)
and when τ is chosen optimally, the government never choses tax rates that lie on the “wrong
side” of the Laffer curve (L(τ ) > 0).
Using the definitions (A.27) and (A.28) on equations (68) and (69) and since H(τ ) and
L(τ ) do not depend on x, we obtain the result that J is decreasing in x if and only if the
function J˜ is decreasing in x:

(A.30)

In the text and previously in the Appendix we showed that all elasticities are increasing
in the marginal tax rate. Therefore, in equation (A.30) the first, third and fourth terms are
negative. The second term is positive, since ∆m increases in the marginal tax rate. To see
this, note that equation (A.5) in the Appendix shows that ∆i increases in the ratio of home
duties to market work for singles and Proposition 1 shows that this ratio increases in the
marginal tax rate.
To show that J˜′ (x; τ ) < 0 it is sufficient to show that the negative term −H(τ )ǫem ,wm (1 +
ǫnm ,wm )/(1 − τ − x)2 (part of the third term in equation (A.30)) dominates the positive term
(1 − γ)ǫem ,wm L(τ )∆′m in equation (A.30). Our strategy is to establish an upper bound for the
positive term (1 − γ)ǫem ,wm L(τ )∆′m and show that this upper bound is smaller in absolute
value than the term −H(τ )ǫem ,wm (1 + ǫnm ,wm )/(1 − τ − x)2 .
Consider the expression Q = (1 − τ − x)nm (x; τ )(γz + (1 − γ)∆m (x; τ )). Q is decreasing
in x because it equals (1 − τ − x)(γznm (x; τ ) + (1 − γ)nsm (x; τ )) and from Proposition 1, labor
supply decreases in taxes. Therefore, denoting with primes the derivatives of functions with
respect to x, we have:
Q′ = −(γznm +(1−γ)nsm )+(1−τ −x)(γz+(1−γ)∆m )n′m +(1−τ −x)nm (1−γ)∆′m < 0 (A.31)
37

Multiplying equation (A.31) by nm , using the definitions ∆m := nsm /nm and ǫnm ,wm :=
−(1 − τ − x)n′m /nm and rearranging we obtain:
Q′ = −(γz + (1 − γ)∆m )(1 + ǫnm ,wm ) + (1 − τ − x)(1 − γ)∆′m < 0
Therefore:
∆′m <

(γz + (1 − γ)∆m )(1 + ǫnm ,wm )
(1 − γ)(1 − τ − x)

(A.32)

(A.33)

Since from Assumption 1 we have z > ∆m , we obtain γz + (1 − γ)∆m < z. Therefore,
inequality (A.33) is written as:
∆′m <

z(1 + ǫnm ,wm )
(1 − γ)(1 − τ − x)

(A.34)

Using inequality (A.34), we can establish an upper bound for the positive term (1 −
γ)ǫem ,wm L(τ )∆′m :
(1 − γ)ǫem ,wm L(τ )∆′m < L(τ )

zǫem ,wm (1 + ǫnm ,wm )
1−τ −x

(A.35)

Finally, we take:
(1 − γ)ǫem ,wm L(τ )∆′m < L(τ )

ǫe ,w (1 + ǫnm ,wm )
zǫem ,wm (1 + ǫnm ,wm )
< H(τ ) m m
1−τ −x
(1 − τ − x)2

(A.36)

Inequality (A.36) states that the absolute value of the (negative) term −H(τ )ǫem ,wm (1 +
ǫnm ,wm )/(1−τ −x)2 is greater than the upper bound of the (positive) term (1−γ)ǫem ,wm L(τ )∆′m
given in inequality (A.35). This holds because 1 − τ − x ≤ 1 and, as previously established,
H(τ ) > z > 1 and L(τ ) ≤ 1.

Notes: The relevant “marginal” tax rate for women’s decision to participate in the labor market is the average tax rate on second earners.
The husband is assumed to earn 100% of Average Productive Worker (APW). The family is assumed to have 2 children. In Columns (2)-(4),
women are assumed to earn 67% of APW. In Columns (5)-(7), women are assumed to earn 100% of APW. Source: Jaumotte (2003).

Notes: The vertical axis depicts the relative marginal revenue function (M R) given by equation (68) and the relative marginal cost function
(M C) given by equation (69). The horizontal axis depicts the gender difference in marginal tax rates x(τ ) = τm − τf for a given level of τf = τ .
As the Figure shows, the relative marginal revenue function is decreasing and exceeds unity at the point of non-differential taxation (x(τ ) = 0).
The relative marginal cost function can be increasing or decreasing. The relative marginal cost function intersects the relative marginal revenue
function at most once and from below. The Figure depicts that the fixed point is positive, x(τ ) > 0, when the relative marginal cost is smaller
than the relative marginal revenue at the point of non-differential taxation by gender (x(τ ) = 0).
