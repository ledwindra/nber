TESTS OF RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND NO RISK PREMIUM IN FORWARD EXCHANGE MARKETS

Abstract

This paper tests the hypothesis that traders have rational expectations
and charge no risk premium in the forward exchange market. It uses a
statistical procedure which is consistent under a large class of heteroscedasticity,
and a set of data which takes into account the institutional features of the
forward exchange market. The results show that inferences using this

procedure are very different from those using the standard assumption of
homoscedastici ty.

Introduction

This paper tests the "simple efficiency" hypothesis in forward exchange

markets. "Simple efficiency," as defined in Hansen and Hodrick (1980), means
that traders have rational expectations and that there is no risk premium in

the forward exchange market. A testable implication of this hypothesis is
that the error committed by the forward rate in forecasting the spot rate has
a zero mean and is uncorrelated with any known information.
The present work represents an improvement over the existing literature

in two respects. One, all researchers have assumed that the aforementioned
forecast error is stationary. Their test statistics are not necessarily
consistent under nonstationarity. This paper uses a statistical procedure
which is consistent for a large class of heteroscedasticity. Inference
results using this procedure are quite different from those using the standard

assumption of homoscedasticity. Two, a new set of data is used, which takes
into account the institutional features of the forward market in m&i:hing th
appropriate spot rate to the forward rate.
Using the new statistical procedure and the new data, I found that the
forecast error is correlated with variables which are assumed to be in tra-

ders' information set, such as past values of spot and forward rates. These
results provide the strongest rejection of the simple efficiency hypothesis
thus far in the published literature, and are consistent with the findings of
the other authors, such as Geweke and Feige (1979) and Hansen and Hodrick

(1980). This does not necessarily imply that the forward market is
"inefficient." Traders may charge a risk premium, which is correlated with

the spot nd forward rates.
The paper is in five sections. The next section discusses the "simple
efficiency" hypothesis. The test procedure is introduced in section three.

—2--

The construction of the data is presented in section four. Eiipirical results
and some conclusions are contained in the final two sections.

2. Tests of the Simple Efficiency Hypothesis

The notation of this paper is as follows. s(t) denotes the natural logarithm of the spot exchange rate at date t, and f(t, ri)1

the natural

logarithm of the forward exchange rate contra.cted at date t for delivery
date t + ri.1

E[s(t

+ n)I(t)] is the expectation of s(t + n) conditioned

on the information set 1(t), which is assumed to contain all present and
past values of spot and forward rates, and the stochastic processes describing
these rates.
M[s(t + n)It)

is the "market's expectation" of s(t + n) at time t.

The hypothesis of rational expectations is that the market's expectation is
the true expectation:

Hi:

M[s(t ÷ n)It] =

E[s(t

+ n)I(t)]

The concept of a single expectation for the entire market may be

uncomforting. But all traders are assumed to have the same information set.
Under rational expectations, they will have the same expectation.
A second hypothesis is required to relate the forward exchange rate to

expectations. The market is assumed to set the forward rate equal to the
expected spot rate on delivery:

H2:

f(t, n) =

M[s(t + n)t]

use logarithms here for two reasons. One, most researchers have used
logarithms. To make my results comparable, I shall follow the same convention. Two, if the stochastic processes are log—normal, then using logarithms
yield an approximation of the return. This is discussed in Hansen and Hodrick
(1981). I note here that the results do not change if I use rates of change
in discrete time.

3—

Sufficient conditions yielding this result are (a) that all traders are risk

neutral, and (b) that markets are competitive. However, if traders are risk
averse, then it is possible to obtain an equilibrium forward rate which is
different from the market expectation, because of the presence of a risk

premium. Thus, H2 is called the hypothesis of "no risk premium" in the
forward rate.

Note that Hi and H2 are totally independent hypotheses. Traders may
have rational expectations, but still require a risk premium for forward

contracts. If they are risk averse, they may (rationally) expect a loss, in
order not to have to carry any exchange risk themselves.

Also, Hi and H2 'are not separately testable, because M[s(t +

n)t]

cannot be observed. However, they jointly imply:

f(t, n) =

(2.1)

E[s(t

+

n)II(t)]

which is called the "simple efficiency" hypothesis in the literature.

A testable implication of (2.1) is the following. Define the n-period

forecast error u(t, n) of the forward rate:

u(t, n) =

(2.2)

s(t)

—

f(t

—

n,

n)

Then the simple efficiency hypothesis implies that u(t, n) has zero mean and
is uncorrelated with any information in I(t —
{s(t — n —

j), f(t

— n —

j,

n):

j

= 0,

1, 2, .

n),

which is assumed to contain

. .}

Thus, the simple efficiency hypothesis implies:
Ti:

u(t, n) has zero mean and is uncorrelated with u(t — n, n)

T2:

u(t, n) has zero mean and is uncorrelated with the n—period holding

yield r(t - n, n) and the n-period forward discount d(t — n, n),
which are defined by:

r(t, n) =

(2.4)

d(t, n) =

f(t,

n)

Ti was first tested by Geweke and Feige (1979). Using quarterly data on
the three month forward rate, i.e., n = 1,

they regressed u(t, 1) on it-

self lagged once and a constant term:

u(t, 1) = a + b u(t — 1, 1) +

(2.5)

The null hypothesis is that a = 0 = b

e(t,

1)

and e(t, 1) is serially uncorrelat—

ed. Assuming that u(t, 1), and hence e(t, 1), is covariance stationary,
they tested a = 0 = b

using the standard F—statistic.

Hansen and Hodrick (1980) tested a more general version of (2.5). Using
weekly data for the three month forward rate, i.e0, n = 13,

they regressed

u(t, 13) on a constant term and lags of u(t — 13, 13):
u(t, 13) = a + B(L) u(t — 13, 13) +

(2.6)

e(t,

13)

where 8(L) is a polynomial in the lag operator L. The null hypothesis is
a = 0 =

B(L), and e(t, 13) is a moving average of order 12, assuming station-

arity. Hansen and Hodrick noted that ordinary least squares (OLS) yields
consistent estimates of the coefficients in (2.6). The test of the null hypoth-

esis a =

0

= B(L)

was conducted with a covariance matrix which accounted for

the fact that the error term was a moving average.

This paper differs from the above work in two respects. First, weekly data

on the seven—day forward exchange rate is used. (Note that n =

1.)

This means

I can employ as many observations as Hansen and Idrick, while retaining serial
uncorrelation of the error term, as in Geweke and Feige. Second, I use a heter—
oscedastic—consistent covariance estimate of the OLS coefficients, relaxing the
assumption of stationarity made in the previous work. This estimator is
discussed in the next section.

3. A Heteroscedastic—Consistent Covariance Estimator of OLS
flsieh (1981) proved that a heteroscedastic—consistent covariance estima-

tor for OLS can be obtained for time series regressions. The estimator is
stated in the general regression model:

squared residuals divided by the number of observa-

tions. (No adjustment is made for the degrees of freedom lost in estimating

the coefficient bOLS since this is only an asymptotic result.) Under
homoscedasticity, VHC and V tend to be the same matrix asymptotically.
If

c(t) is

indeed heteroscedastic, then V0 may not be consistent, but

VHC is always consistent, provided the assumptions (i) through (vi) hold.

The difference between VHC and V

Asymptotically, V0 and VHC tend to the same matrix, if E(t)2 and
x(t)x(t)' are not correlated.

tends to underestimate (overestimate) the

true covariance if c(t)2 and and x(t)x(t)' are positively (negatively)
correlated. Since homoscedasticity is not implied by the simple efficiency

hypothesis, I prefer to conduct Ti and T2 using VHC rather than
although both sets of results are reported.

4. Construction of the Data
Most empirical studies of the forward exchange market ignore the timing

of delivery of forward contracts. The most important feature is that forward
contracts do not have constant lengths. For example, a one—month contract
sold on July 18 is due on August 18, assuming that August 18 is a business day.

(See Riehl and driquez (1977) for a detailed discussion.) This institutional feature means that forward rates and spot exchange rates must be properly
matched if tests of the simple efficiency hypothesis are to be conducted.
Another interesting feature of forward markets is that the forward con-

tract is delivered two business days after the contract is due. In the above
example, delivery will take place on August 20, assuming the 19th and the 20th

are both business days. For a hedger, i.e., someone holding a covered position, this means that the one—month forward contract is actually longer than a

month. But for a speculator, i.e., someone holding an open position, this is
not true. He must purchase foreign exchange on the spot market to cover his
position. Since spot transactions are also delivered two business days after
the trades are made, a speculator will trade in the spot market at the time

—8—

when the forward contract is due, i.e., on August 18, and not when the contract is delivered, i.e., August 20.

This paper matches up the forward rates and spot rates for a speculator

using a seven—day forward contract. This has several advantages: (i) the
length of the contracts are constant, (ii) many non—overlapping observations
are available, and (iii) the nonoverlapping observations allow the use of the
heteroscedastic—consistent covariance estimator for the OLS coefficients.

Covered Interest Arbitrage
Multinational banks frequently deal in one—, two—, and seven—day forward

contracts. But data are not publically available. However, using the "covered
interest arbitrage" formula, I can construct forward contracts from seven—day
eurocurrency rates and the spot exchange rates.
Let me illustrate this for the case of the U.S. dollar/German mark rate.

I can buy forward marks for dollars in two ways. I can buy a seven—day

forward contract at F(t, n) marks per dollar. Or, I can borrow from the eurodollar market at the rate i(t, 1), sell the dollars in the spot exchange
market for S(t) marks, and deposit the marks in a eurobank at the rate
i*(t, 1). The two methods should lead to the same number of forward marks for
each dollar (aside from brokerage costs.) This equivalence is the "covered
interest arbitrage" condition:

(4.1)

F(t, 1) =

S(t)

(1 ÷ i(t, l))/(l +

i*(t,

1))

Eaker (1980) showed that arbitrage opportunities using ninety—day forward and
eurocurrency rates essentially do not exist.

This reader may

object

to the construction of the forward rate in this

manner, because there are brokerage costs. Conversations with a foreign exchange trader revealed that brokerage costs are quite small-—about 12 U.s.
dollars per million U.S. dollars of transactions.

—9—

Data Sources

Seven—day forward rates are constructed in this manner for seven other
currencies-—the British pound, the French franc, the Swiss franc, the Dutch
guilder, the Italian lira, the Canadian dollar, and the Japanese yen——in addition to the German

mark.

The spot exchange rates and eurocurrency interest

rates are Friday closing rates in London, published by the Financial Times.
The data start on June 9, 1978 and end on April 24, 1981, totaling 151 observ-

ations per exchange rate. The choice of currencies and dates are limited by
the availability of data.

On several occasions, seven—day eurocurrency interest rates were not

available (mostly in the case of the eurosterling.) They were replaced by the
one—month rates if available, and with the rates from the previous day if one—

month rates wre also not available. In addition, the London exchange was

closed on April 4, 1980. The rates on April 3 were used instead. These
imperfections may

affect

the results, particularly if these dates are

outliers. (This is not the case.)

5. The Econometric Results
The econometric results are presented in Tables 1 through 4. The first
two tables contain the results of Tl, which runs the regression:

(5.1)

u(t, 1)

= a + B(L)

u(t

—

1, 1) +

e(t,

1)

The null hypothesis is a = 0 = B(L)
As discussed in Geweke and Feige (1979), two versions of this test are

possible: the single market and the multi—market test. The difference lies
in the amount of information available to the trader.

—10—

Let

superscript

j

denote the j—th currency. The single market test

assumes the trader in the j—th market has the information set I(t)

=

{r3(t,

1), r(t

1, 1), ...,

d(t,

1), d(t — 1, 1), ...} .

The multi—

market test assumes that each trader has the information set 1(t)

=

{r(t,

1), r(t

1, 1), ...,

d(t,

j=

1), d(t — 1, 1), ... :

1,

.,

8}

In the single market test, (5.1) is a system of 8 univariate regressions,
of the form:

(5.2)

u(t, 1) =

a

+ bu3(t

The result of testing a = 0 = bJk

k —

1, 1) 4

e(t,

1),

j

= 1, ..., 8

using 10 lags, are in Table 1. The

first

column reports the test statistic computed under the standard procedure, which

assumes homoskedasticity of e(t, 1). This uses the OC covariance in
(3.3). The second column reports the test statistic using the HC covariance
in (3.2), which is consistent under a large class of heteroscedasticity of
e3(t, 1). The latter procedure leads to a higher rate of rejection of the

null hypothesis. In fact, only the Canadian dollar fails under OC at the
five percent significance level, while three out of eight currencies fail

under HC.
In the multi—market test, (5.1) is a vector autoregression:

(5.3)

u(t, 1) =

a

b uZ(t — k

+

—

1, 1) +

e(t,

1),

j

= 1, .., 8

k £=1

The results of testing a = 0 =

bkf

using 2 lags, are in Table 2. The

null hypothesis is rejected at the five percent level for five currencies

under OC, and six currencies under HC.
In T2, the following regression is run:

(5.2)

u(t, 1) = a + C(L) x(t — 1, 1) + D(L) d(t —

1, 1) +

e(t,

1)

—11—

As in Ti, the test can be done in the singie market and multi-market context. In the former case, the one—period forecast error of each currency is
regressed on a constant term and a distributed lag of its holding yields and

its forward discount. (Five lags are used.) The results, reported in Table
3, show that three of eight currencies are rejected at the five percent level

under OC, and six of eight under HC.
In the latter case, each forecast error is regressed on a constant term
and one lag of the holding yields and forward discounts of all eight curren—

cies. The results, in Table 4, show that the null hypothesis is rejected in

one of eight cases under OC, and all eight cases under HC, at the five
percent level.

6. Conclusion
The empirical results are interesting for two reasons. First, they show
that there is a large difference in inference between using the OC covariance
(which assumes homoscedasticity) and the HC covariance (which allows for a

large class of heteroscedasticity). This is particularly evident in the
multi—market tests performed in Table 4. These results suggest that the OC
covariance often overestimate the standard errors of the OLS coefficients.
Second, the results provide the strongest rejection of the simple

efficiency hypothesis thus far in the published literature. However, these
results are not strictly comparable to those of Fige and Geweke (1979) and
Hansen and Hodrick (1980), because of the differences in forecast horizons.
There are at least three possibilities to account for the rejection of

simple efficiency. One, traders may not know the full structural model of
exchange rate determination. They may not know the intervention rule of the
central banks, or they may not know some parameters of the model. In this
case, serial correlation in forecast errors may be observed.

Two, there may be a risk premium in the forward market. This arises from
many circumstances, including differences in risk preferences. Theoretical
models which demonstrate this point are Solnik (1974), Grauer, Litzenberger,
and Stehie (1976), Stockinan (1978), Fama and Farber (1979), Frankel (1979),

Poll and Solnik (1979), and Stulz (1980).

Three, traders may simply act in an irrational manner. Further study is
needed to find out which of these alternative hypotheses is responsible for
the failure of simple efficiency in the forward exchange market.
