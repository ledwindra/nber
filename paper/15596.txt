ABSTRACT
The relationships among the weather, agricultural markets, and financial markets have long been of
interest to economic historians, but relatively little empirical work has been done. We push this literature
forward by using modern drought indexes, which are available in detail over a wide area and for long
periods of time to perform a battery of tests on the relationship between these indexes and sensitive
indicators of financial stress. The drought indexes were devised by climate historians from instrument
records and tree rings, and because they are unfamiliar to most economic historians and economists,
we briefly describe the methodology. The financial literature in the area can be traced to William
Stanley Jevons, who connected his sun spot theory to rainfall patterns. The Dust bowl of the 1930s
brought the climate-finance link to the attention of the general public. Here we assemble new evidence
to test various hypotheses involving the impact of extreme swings in moisture on financial stress.

The relationships among the weather, agricultural markets, and financial markets have long
been of interest to economic historians, but relatively little empirical work has been done. We push
this literature forward by using modern drought indexes, which are available in detail over a wide
area and for long periods of time to perform a battery of tests on the relationship between these
indexes and sensitive indicators of financial stress.
The drought indexes were devised by climate historians from instrument records and tree
rings, and because they are unfamiliar to most economic historians and economists, we briefly
describe the methodology. The financial literature in the area can be traced to William Stanley
Jevons, who connected his sun spot theory to rainfall patterns. The Dust bowl of the 1930s brought
the climate-finance link to the attention of the general public. Here we assemble new evidence to
test various hypotheses involving the impact of extreme swings in moisture on financial stress.

Prior Work on Climate and Financial Markets
The idea that climate affects the financial sector and through the financial sector the
economy as a whole has a long, if not always persuasive, history among economists. The British
economist William Stanley Jevons (1884, 221-43) famously argued that financial crises were
produced, ultimately, by sunspots. Financial crises had occurred with an average frequency of 10 to
20 years in Jevons’s time (1825, 1836, 1847, and 1866). Could it be an accident, Jevons asked, that
spots appeared on the surface of the sun at (approximately) the same intervals? The connection,
Jevons concluded, was through India. Sunspot activity disrupted rainfall and harvests in India. Low
incomes in India depressed imports from Britain. The disruption of British trade with India in turn
produced the financial crises. Jevons's son, H. Stanley Jevons (1933), attempted to defend and
extend his father's theory. He recognized that the business cycle was the result of several factors.
However, he argued that a harvest cycle of 3+ years was part of the business cycle, and that harvest
2

cycle was related to meteorological conditions (shown in part in the tree ring data), and the regular
fluctuations in meteorological conditions were partly the result of fluctuations in solar radiation.
Although Jevons's sunspot theory was often ridiculed, John Maynard Keynes's (1936, 531)
cautious conclusion is to be preferred: "The theory was prejudiced by being stated in too precise and
categorical a form. Nevertheless, Jevons notion, that meteorological phenomena play a part in
harvest fluctuations and that harvest fluctuations play a part (though more important formerly than
to-day) in the trade cycle, is not to be lightly dismissed."
Similarly, the American economist Henry Ludwell Moore (1921) argued that the business
cycle was produced by the “transit of Venus.” Every eight years Venus stands between the Earth
and the Sun disrupting the Sun’s radiation on its path to the earth. The result, according to Moore, is
a regular eight-year rainfall cycle (identifiable in part by evidence from tree rings), a regular eightyear crop cycle, and a regular eight-year business cycle.
Weather driven fluctuations in harvests also play a role in accounts of particular episodes.
Indeed the business cycle at the end of the nineteenth century has often been described as a product
of climate and agriculture. Friedman and Schwartz (1963, 98) argued that the cyclical expansion
from 1879 to 1882 was reinforced by "two successive years of bumper crops in the United States
and unusually short crops elsewhere." Katherine Coman (1911, 315) thought that the bumper crop
of 1884 had produced the opposite effect because it sold for low prices: "The wheat crop of 1884
was the largest that had ever been harvested, and the price fell to sixty four cents a bushel, half that
obtained three years before." As a result there was a rash of bankruptcies in the wheat growing areas
and the "inability of the agriculturists to meet their obligations to Eastern capitalists and to purchase
the products of Eastern mills and workshops, extended and prolonged the industrial depression."
Wesley Clair Mitchell (1941, 2) argued that the recovery from the 1890 financial crisis was partly a

3

harvest driven event: "Unusually large American crops of grain, sold at exceptionally high prices,
cut short what was promising to be an extended period of liquidation after the crisis of 1890 and
suddenly set the tide of business rising." O.M.W. Sprague (1910, 154) attributed the severity of the
depression that followed the crisis of 1893 to low farm prices and high farm mortgages. Ernest
Ludlow Bogart (1939, 690) agreed that the farm sector was heavily involved in the depression of
the 1890s because of “the ruinous failure of the corn crop in 1894, and the falling off of the
European demand for wheat, the price of which fell to less than fifty cents a bushel.” The poor corn
harvest was the result of drought (New York Times; August 4, 1894, p. 1, August 5, 1894, p.8, and
subsequent stories). Friedman and Schwartz concluded (1963, 140) that the economic revival after
1896 was reinforced by "another one of those fortuitous combinations of good harvests at home and
poor harvests abroad that were so critical from time to time in nineteenth-century American
economic history."
A. Piatt Andrew (1906) surveyed many of these individual episodes. He concluded that
although corn, cotton, and wheat were the most important U.S. crops, and that all influenced the
business cycle, the latter two especially through exports, it was fluctuations in the value of the wheat
crop that had the most impact on the business cycle. The reason was that wheat was an international
crop and hence the influence of the American harvest could be offset or reinforced by the success or
failure of wheat crops abroad. Recent work by Davis, Hanes, and Rhode (2009), has reinforced the
view that weather-driven harvest events influenced the macroeconomy in the period between the
U.S return to the gold standard after the Civil War and World War I. The channel ran through the
balance of payments: Strong cotton exports produced increased imports of gold, expansion of the
money supply, and lower interest rates. However, they challenge the claim of earlier writers that

4

wheat and corn harvests mattered, finding little statistical evidence for a relationship running from
the wheat or corn to industrial production.
A related literature emphasizes that the restrictions on branch banking in the United States
weakened the U.S. banking system, especially when compared with foreign systems that permitted
branch banking, such as the Canadian system (Bordo, Rockoff, and Redish 1994; Calomiris 2000,
chapter 1; Ramirez 2003). Why might this be so? There are several possibilities. A recent paper by
Carlson and Mitchener (2009), for example, argues that branch banking increased stability in the
1930s by increasing competition, and thus forcing more prudent behavior on competing banks and
branches. Clearly, however, an obvious potential explanation for the apparent stability of branch
banking systems is that branch banking permitted banks to diversify local weather related
agricultural shocks. One purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of climate driven
banking shocks in American financial history.

Measuring Drought
Today researchers have a vast array of instruments to measure weather conditions around
the globe from satellites and weather stations based on land and sea and in the atmosphere.
Unfortunately the time-depth of these readings is inadequate for an historical study that reaches
back to the era when farming was a dominant source of national income. Understanding the
practical limitations of empirical research requires a brief discussion of technology, concepts,
private efforts and government action that unfolded since the early 1700s.
Instrument readings. Ideally one would have a geographically dense array of comparable
instrument readings that cover various aspects of weather over the past several centuries. Devices
for measuring temperature and rainfall, however, were crude until the early eighteenth century,

5

when Daniel Fahrenheit invented the mercury thermometer (1714) and Reverend Horsely
developed the rain gauge (pluviometer) consisting of a funnel placed at the top of a cylinder (1722).
In the 1720s Anders Celsius assisted Erik Burman in recording temperatures in Uppsala, and soon
thereafter observational sites appeared elsewhere in Sweden.
Although the new technologies solved the problem of consistency, enabling people in
distant places to take comparable readings, these early efforts were based on various thermometer
scales that had to be converted into a common metric. Recordkeeping efforts were largely private
or handled by scientific societies until well into the nineteenth century. Systematic study of weather
patterns and their causes, much less climate change and its implications, could not begin effectively
until a substantial body of evidence had accumulated. In the United States the Smithsonian
Institution took the lead in developing a weather network in 1849 based on 150 voluntary observers.
In 1874 the task passed to the U.S. Army Signal Service, whose functions were transferred to the
newly created U.S. Weather Bureau in 1891. By 1900 numerous countries had created national
meteorological services.
Concepts. After data collection became routine, researchers suggested ideas for measuring
drought (Heim, 2002). In the early 1900s drought was defined by a rule of thumb: 21 or more days
with rainfall below one-third of normal. Thornthwait (1931) proposed the concept of
evapotranspiration or the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration, which led to ideas of water
balance and alternative time scales. Palmer (1965) developed four measures: (a) a hydrological
drought index based on measures of groundwater and stream flow with a horizon of 1+ years; (b) a
drought severity index with a 9 month horizon; (c) a Z index that measures moisture anomaly in a
particular month; and (d) a crop moisture index that monitors weekly conditions. Soon other

6

measures appeared, such as the standardized precipitation index, a surface water supply index, and
the vegetation condition index measured from satellite images.
Here we analyze Palmer’s Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which has a time scale useful for
assessing the economic consequences of yearly fluctuations or clusters of annual patterns in
effective moisture (precipitation minus losses from evapotranspiration). Its water balance equation
includes rainfall, runoff, evaporation, transpiration, and soil recharge, which are converted to a scale
of -6 (extreme drought) to +6 (extremely wet) relative to normal or average conditions for a locality
(Palmer 1965). It ignores stream flow, reservoir levels and snowfall, and is less useful in mountain
areas or regions of microclimates (Alley 1984). It is fortunate for our purposes that the PDSI can be
reconstructed from tree rings, which provide a chronology over hundreds, or even thousands of
years if especially long-lived trees are available (such as bristlecone pines) or preserved logs can be
extracted from peat bogs or old buildings.
Dendochronology. Leonardo da Vinci recognized that rings in the branches of trees show
annual growth and the thickness of the rings indicate the years that were more or less dry. Andrew
Douglas was a pioneer who formulated the scientific basis of the field in the 1920s and 1930s, and
importantly the principle of cross dating, whereby overlapping chronologies from different trees
could be merged to form long series. He founded the Laboratory of Tree Ring Research at the
University of Arizona, where he and co-workers collected a vast number of cores using a tubular
boring device.
To understand the meaning of tree rings, growth is decomposed into five parts:
(1)

Rt = At + Ct + φD1t + φD2t + Et

where R denotes ring width; t the year; φ is a presence or absence indicator (taking values of 0 or 1)
A is the age trend of tree growth; C indicates climate; D1 represents external disturbance processes

7

such as a fire; D2 represents internal growth disturbance such as a disease; and E is an error term.
The goal is to decipher or solve for C given R and information on A, D1 and D2. To reduce the
effects of disturbances it is useful to collect large samples in a particular locality.

The Drought Database
Researchers have estimated the Palmer Drought Severity Index from instrument records,
which cover the period 1900 to the present, and from tree rings, which go back as much as two
thousand years depending upon the locality. Thus there is a break in our data source in 1900, and
for this reason it is prudent to divide the analysis into two corresponding parts. We are aware that
contrasts in the results across the two periods might be attributable to different data sources or to a
structural shift in the relationship between drought and economic activity.
Assembling tree ring chronologies and estimating PDSI is an ongoing process, which is
described in The North American Drought Atlas by Cook and Krusic (2004). Here we use PDSI
values estimated from 835 tree ring chronologies scattered across North America, which researchers
used to estimate PDSI values at 286 grid points (the raw data are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pdsi.html). The points are evenly spaced over a 2.5 degree grid
(roughly 175 miles apart), which provides a useful approximation to annual net moisture conditions
at the local (state) level.1

1

Cook and Krusic used point-by-point regression, which is a sequential, automated fitting of single-point principal

component regression models to a grid of climate variables taken from instrument readings. The method assumes that
only those tree-ring chronologies close to a given PDSI grid point are good predictors of drought at that location. They
used instrument data from 1928-1978 (the calibration period) to develop each regression equation. The remaining data
from 1900-1927 (the verification period) of the instrument record were used to test the validity of the PDSI estimates.
Additional details, including a map of the grid points and a discussion of statistical methods, are available at:
http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.LDEO/.TRL/.NADA2004/.pdsi-atlas.html.

In this study we use two sets of drought indexes obtained from the North American Drought
Atlas by Cook and Lamont (2004). The first is a set of instrumental PDSI readings for the sample
period from 1900 to 2005. The second is a set of reconstructed PDSI readings using tree ring data
that can be used to extrapolate the PDSI data far back into the past.

Our Bank "Stress Test"
There are many variables that could be used to measure the degree of stress placed on a
banking system by adverse climatic changes. These include bank failures; changes in various
balance sheet items, such as surplus accounts; rates of return on various categories of assets, such as
rates of returns on loans; and the rate of return to bank equity.
At first thought, bank failure rates might seem to be a best measure of stress. There are,
however, several problems with this measure. (1) In many periods there were relatively few
National Bank failures. Failures were concentrated among state chartered and private banks, and
economic historians, as far as we are aware, have not assembled the data for these sectors. (2)
Panics sometimes led to the temporary or permanent closure of many smaller banks because of lack
of liquidity, even though these banks were solvent. It is often difficult to determine from existing
information whether closures were temporary or permanent, and whether they were the result of
insolvency from bad investments or illiquidity from panics that spread from region to region.
Obviously, these considerations do not suggest that failure rates contain no information; they merely
suggest that using the existing data would be more difficult than it might seem.
Another measure of bank stress would be changes in the surplus account, the account where
accountants write down the value of non-performing loans. To test the usefulness of this variable we

9

selected 18 states that we thought to be likely suspects for a significant relationship between drought
and banking stress. We then compiled surplus and other capital accounts for all banks in the state
(national, state, and private) for the period 1896 to 1955 from All Bank Statistics (Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve 1959). Finally, we regressed these variables on drought indexes,
but found no systematic relationships. It may be that the assumption that surplus accounts in that era
were sensitive indicators of poor loan performance is mistaken.
For these reasons we turned to rates of return to bank equity as an indicator of bank stress.
The data that we use is for National Banks because these banks regularly reported information on
their balance sheets and income and expenditures to the Comptroller of the Currency. Data on state
chartered banks would be valuable because state banks were important in many of the agricultural
states where we would expect drought to have played an important role. Unfortunately, the form in
which state bank balance sheets were reported varied from state to state and the crucial income and
expenditure data was seldom included. Typically, the National Bank data has been used to compute
regional bank lending rates. Major contributions include Lance Davis (1965), Richard Sylla (1969),
Gene Smiley (1975), and John James (1976). The most recent, and in our view, best data now
available are the estimates prepared by Scott A. Redenius (2007a). We have focused instead on the
rate of return to bank equity because it has several important strengths as a measure of bank stress.
(1) It is available from 1869, while most other series are available from a later date. (2) It can be
computed from data that were regularly reported to the Comptroller with relatively few judgment
calls by the historian. (3) It reflects losses due to late payments and reductions in surplus due to the
writing down the value of nonperforming loans. (4) It represents a decision variable for banks,
banking authorities, and the public. At some point a bank that earns no income must be closed. (5)
The alternative, bank lending rates, was hard to interpret in the specific cases, Kansas after the Civil

10

War and Oklahoma in the 1930s that we explored in detail. Scott A. Redenius compiled the data we
use and was kind enough to share it with us.2
Before proceeding to our empirical tests of the relationship between drought and banking
stress, we will look at two cases that are well known to historians: Kansas after the Civil War and
Oklahoma in the Great Depression. These examples should give us a better appreciation of the
effects we can expect in extreme circumstances.

In God we trusted, in Kansas we busted
Perhaps the clearest examples of climate driven financial distress in U.S. history come from
Kansas between the Civil War and 1900. This was the period in which Kansas became famous for
the motto, emblazoned on the covered wagons of farm families leaving Kansas, “In God we trusted,
in Kansas we busted.”
Chart 1 shows the reconstructed Palmer Drought Severity Index for Kansas from 1870 to
1900. The periods of drought in the post-Civil War era match up well with the periods of financial
distress. The first year of severe drought after the Civil War, 1874, was the year the famous locust
swarms devastated plains farmers. A second postbellum drought followed in 1879 – 1881. Four
years of good rain from 1882 through 1885 helped create a land boom in western Kansas, but
drought struck again in 1886 through 1888.
We have found little discussion about banking in Kansas during the first (locust) drought.
More is available, however, about the second drought. Allan G. Bogue in his classic Money at
Interest (1955, 103-109) describes the experience of J. B. Watkins and Company a major supplier of
mortgage money in western Kansas, and other mortgage bankers. When crops failed during the

Scholars who wish to use this data should contact Professor Redenius at Brandeis University. Redenius (20007b) uses
this data to explore several hypotheses about the integration of the American banking market.

11

1879-1881 drought farmers, hoping for loans to tide them over, or to provide the basis after they
defaulted for a new start elsewhere, besieged Watkins' agents. In those circumstances it was hard to
make safe loans because desperate farmers, and their friends, were willing to attest to any value for
a property in order to get some cash. In the end Watkins was stuck with a large number of defaults,
and for a time he stopped lending in some of the western counties. This episode, however, failed to
prevent a rapid surge of development in the early 1880s when rain again became abundant.
Drought, however, struck once again in 1886. Again Watkins responded by cutting off lending in
the affected areas (Bogue 1955, 144-145). Even so, Watkins ended up holding large amounts of
land as a result of mortgage foreclosures (Bogue 1955, 167).
The final drought in the nineteenth century lasted four years from 1893 through1896. This
was an unusually prolonged drought. One would have to go back to the Civil War Years or forward
to the 1950s to find periods in which a four-year average of the Palmer Drought Severity Index was
as low as it was in the mid-1890s.3 It was also a period of international financial distress following
the Panic of 1893, and as was often the case when there was a depression of international scope, low
prices for basic agricultural products. Kansas, in other words, was hit by a perfect storm (perfect
lack of storms?): insufficient rain to grow familiar crops, an international financial crisis and
depression, and low prices for agricultural products.
The drought and depression of the 1890s was disastrous for the financial system of Kansas.
Most of the western mortgage companies, including J. B. Watkins failed (Bogue 1955, 187-192).
These companies had been raising capital in the Eastern United States and in Europe, some of it
with mortgage-backed securities (Snowden 1995) – securities that were similar to those that
underlay today's financial crisis. Therefore, Kansas's financial difficulties spread quickly. Once
3

It is interesting to note that there was also a sustained drought during 1855 through 1857, the years of "bleeding
Kansas."

12

again farmers left Kansas with the motto "In God We Trusted, in Kansas we Busted" emblazoned
on their "prairie schooners." The farmers who used the motto, despite the hardships they had
endured, were not always done with pioneering. The Emporia Daily Gazette, (Emporia, KS)
Monday, August 21, 1893, reported a line of prairie schooners bearing the motto “In God we
trusted, in Kansas we busted. So now let ‘er rip for the Cherokee Strip.”
Chart 2, which plots National bank capital in Kansas, measured in 1890 dollars, from 1865
to 1910, shows the booms and busts.4 Bank capital expands rapidly during the boom of the 1880s,
reaches a peak in 1890, and then declines for a decade. Total capital finally surpasses the 1890 level
in 1908, but even then the par value of outstanding shares was still below the 1890 level. This
suggests that most of the growth after 1899 was due to reinvestment of bank profits rather than
outside investment.
National bank lending rates, however, do not show a strong impact from Kansas's struggles.
Chart 3 plots the bank lending rate in the Western Plains less the national average for 1888 (the first
year that is available) to 1910. The great drought of the 1890s does not show up as a period of
exceptionally high or low rates. There is an uptick in 1897 after the depression began to lift, but this
seems to be part of a general increase in regions of new settlement: witness the uptick in rates on the
Pacific coast less the national average.
The rate of return to National Bank equity in Kansas, shown in chart 4, tells a somewhat
different story. Here we can see clearly the boom of the mid-1880s and then the collapse as the
bubble burst, a downturn that seems to precede the national downturn. The drought of 1887 leaves a
strong impact on rates of return to equity. But the effect of the drought of the mid1890s is less clear.
From 1894 on, Kansas returns follow the national average.

4

The chart in nominal terms is similar.

13

The Comptroller of the Currency in those days assigned a reason for the failure of each
national bank. Table 1 shows the 34 National banks that failed in Kansas between 1875 and 1910
and the reasons given by the Comptroller. The 1890s were the hard years. In 1890 alone, the worst
year, there were 7 failures. Most of the banks that failed in 1890 and 1891 had been in operation for
only a few years, they were creatures of the boom. The exception is the First National Bank of
Abilene, which had been in existence for 11 years, but the average was 5 years. In the early 1890s,
as in other periods, the Comptroller tended to attribute failures vaguely to injudicious banking,
excessive loans to particular stakeholders, or fraud. In 1890 and 1891, however, the Comptroller
mentions real estate four times. After that real estate is cited only once more, in 1896. “Stringency”
in the money market, on the other hand, is not mentioned before 1893, but is given as a reason in
three of the failures that occur in that year. This evidence is consistent with a sudden real estate
boom and bust aggravated by an international financial crisis.
The most important economic reason for failure, taking the period as a whole, was
“depreciation of securities,” which was mentioned in 16 cases. The nature of these "securities" is
not clear from the information in the Comptroller's Reports. It might be possible to learn more in the
archives of the Comptroller, where detailed records of the liquidation of closed National banks are
available. One possibility is that they were mortgage-backed securities issued by the land
companies. Holding these securities was probably not consistent with the provisions of National
Banking Act then in effect that prohibited lending on real estate, but banks might have held them
anyway. After all they were "securities." Our guess, however, is that many of these securities were
railroad and municipal bonds. There had been a huge railroad construction boom in Kansas in the
years leading up to the debacle of the 1890s fueled by expectations of rapid expansion of agriculture
(Miller 1925, 470-71).

14

The Dust Bowl
The dust bowl of the 1930s, another classic case of climate-driven economic distress, was
most severe in Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and parts of New Mexico during 1930-36.
However, as shown in Chart 5, which plots a 3-year moving average of the Instrumental Palmer
Drought Severity Index for Oklahoma and Texas for 1900-1975, the drought of the 1930s, although
severe, was far from extraordinary. By this measure it was much less severe than the drought that hit
in the 1950s. Hansen and Libecap (2004) explain that the severity of the agriculture crisis in the
1930s was due in part to the prevalence of small farms that did not engage sufficiently in practices
to limit wind erosion. Nevertheless, the episode should test the extent to which severe drought
challenges financial markets.
It appears that bank lending rates were somewhat higher in the dust bowl region in the
period 1933-1936 than might have been expected. Rates in this region rose while lending rates in
most other regions (and other interest rates generally) fell. This is evident in Chart 6, which shows
the difference between the rate in the West Lower South and the national average, and a linear
trend. It is clear that the differential rose above trend in the depression years.
This elevation in rates could also reflect a systemic regional risk premium. This premium, if
that is the proper interpretation, began to fall in 1937, although it was the end of the decade before
the West Lower South premium had returned to trend. In order to test whether the dust bowl
elevation in rates was an isolated event, we ran a series of regressions of the West Lower South rate
on lagged values of itself, lagged values of the national rate, and the current and lagged values of the
Palmer Drought Severity Index. None of our regressions suggested a systematic relationship
between the drought severity index and the bank lending rate.

15

Chart 7 shows rates of return on national bank equity for Oklahoma, Texas, and the United
States as a whole, for the years 1920 to 1950. Somewhat surprisingly, neither the Oklahoma nor the
Texas systems show a sharp negative impact as a result of the Dust Bowl. For the most part, Texas,
followed the national average reflecting its more diversified economy. Oklahoma actually recovered
more rapidly than the system as a whole, and posted positive returns in 1933 and 1934. Possibly the
development of a regional risk premium in the lending rate served to protect National Bank earnings
in Oklahoma.
It appears that the banking distress that resulted from the depression and the dust bowl was
concentrated among the small state banks and private banks that served rural Oklahoma, and often
lost money on livestock loans (Doti and Schweikart 1991, 144), rather than the National Banks. One
problem faced by rural banks, in addition to farmers who could not pay their mortgages, was a rash
of bank robberies. The most notorious of all the Oklahoma bank robbers was Charles "Pretty Boy"
Floyd who by 1934 had become the FBI's "public enemy number one" (Smallwood 1979, 120-21).
Oklahoma and surrounding states would face another severe drought in the 1950s. However, by
then economic conditions had changed in Oklahoma. The banks had new fields in which to invest:
beef production and, most important, oil (Smallwood 1959, 149-55). There seems, therefore, to
have been little imprint of the drought on rates of return to equity in National banks. Nevertheless,
long-term time series regressions were more "successful" in generating significant effects running
from the drought index to the return on equity, than the experiments using bank loan rates. Financial
distress may in turn have aggravated the economic distress in the dust bowl. It would have been
more difficult, for example, for a farmer who had developed a relationship with a troubled bank and
who wanted a loan to tide him over the hard times to get one, or for a farmer who wanted to borrow
to expand his holdings by purchasing smaller failed farms to get the credit to do so. Conceivably,

16

the Canadian banking system in which banks in rural areas, including drought stricken areas, were
branches of large nationwide systems was better able to provide services in these areas. It is
plausible that unfavorable weather conditions could place regional financial systems under stress.
And possibly, during financial panics, ignite or contribute to a contagion of fear, but as our
preliminary look at the dust bowl suggests, the interactions between economic and financial
conditions can be complex and hard to detect.

Econometric Analysis
We would expect there to be two possible effects of drought (or excessive rainfall) on the
banking sector: a demand effect and a supply effect. (1) A demand effect would arise because
drought affects the income of farmers and businesses related to farming. Low farm incomes would
mean that farmers were likely to fall behind on loan repayments, which would directly reduce rates
of return to equity. Drought, moreover, would lower aggregate demand in the region affected by the
drought, which would lower the demand for new loans, which in turn would reduce interest rates
and rates of return to equity. (2) A supply effect could arise if the weather conditions reduced bank
capital, reduced the supply of loanable funds, and increased interest rates and rates of return. If the
demand effect dominates then we would expect the rate of return to be positively related to the
drought index – that is, in periods of drought we would see the rate of return on bank capital
declining and in periods of abundant rainfall we would see the rate of return on bank capital
increasing. If the supply effect dominates we would expect to see that the rate of return on bank
capital be negatively correlated with drought severity. Conceivably, the demand effect could
dominate during normal periods with the supply effect only apparent during periods of “high stress”
such as severe drought or flood. In this case we would expect to see the drought index having a non-

17

linear effect on the banks rates of return. We will test for this by allowing for the rate of return and
foreclosure rates to be non-linearly related to the drought index.
The aim of this analysis is to first determine whether there was any relationship between
drought and our variables of financial stress: farm income, foreclosures on farm mortgages, and the
rate of return to bank capital. We also want to determine if there were systematic relationships
across the country as a whole or whether any effect we find is confined to only certain regions of the
country. We do this by estimating a panel (fixed effects) regression with the rate of return to bank
capital, the farm foreclosure rate, and the farm income rate, as dependent variables in turn.
This section is broken up into three parts: (1) we first determine the underlying unit root
properties of the time series we use in our regressions, (2) we then test for a relationship between
our measures of bank and financial stress and drought at a national level and then (3) at a regional
level.

Unit Root Analysis Tests
Table 2 contains various panel unit root tests for the rate of return on bank capital, the
foreclosure rate, real farm income, and for both of our drought indexes. We report two types of
panel unit root tests: the first type are tests that assume a common unit root among the variables – in
this case we assume a common unit root across states – and the second type of tests assume that
each State has individual unit roots. In all tests the null hypothesis for this test is that the time series
contains a unit root and the alternative is that the time series is stationary. The number of lags used
in the panel unit root tests was chosen using the Schwarz-Bayesian Information Criterion (SBIC).
The results for all the tests below show that the unit root hypothesis can be rejected for all time
series except for real income. In almost all cases the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 1% level

18

with only a few tests resulting in a rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5% level. Given the results
of the unit root tests we will treat each time series except farm income as a stationary time series so
that each series on drought severity, the rate of return on bank capital, and the farm foreclosure rates
will enter into our regression equations in levels. For farm income we use the percentage change in
farm income as the dependent variable.

Effects of Drought on Rates of Return
The first set of regressions uses the rate of return on bank capital as the dependent variable
and our measures of drought severity (PDSI) as the explanatory variables. We estimated a linear
panel regression with fixed effects for the States listed in Table 3. Cluster robust standard errors are
used with the clusters defined by the nine divisions reported in Table 3 which are based on the US
Census regional divisions.5 The robust standard errors are robust to unknown autocorrelation within
the time series and unknown heteroscedasticity across the cluster units. We estimate first a model
that is linear in the drought severity index (PDSI) and then add a quadratic term (PDSI2) to check
whether extreme weather conditions have a non-linear effect on the rate of return to bank capital.
The results from the panel regressions with the rate of return of bank capital are found in
Tables 4 through 8. In Table 4 the results of the linear and quadratic specifications are reported for a
panel consisting of the 42 states in our sample. For both drought severity indexes we find that there
is a significant positive effect of the drought index on the rate of return on bank capital: more rain
means a higher return. The quadratic term is significant for the regression over the whole period

5

We do not include time effects as there is a high degree of correlation between the drought severity indexes across
States. By including time effects we run the risk of capturing weather effects as time effects which we do not want to
happen.

19

(from 1900-1976 for atmospheric PDSI and from 1850-1976 for the tree-ring reconstructed PDSI).6
The negative sign on the quadratic term indicates that periods of extreme drought have a worsening
effect on the rate of return to bank capital and that periods of extreme wet can also adversely affect
the rate of return to bank capital.
When we re-estimate the model for different sub-periods, also reported in Table 4, we see
that the period from 1900-1940 is where biggest effect is found. The coefficient on PDSI is over 50
basis points higher for this period than for the later period from 1940 to 1976. This suggests that the
effect of weather on the banking system has not been uniform over time. When using the tree-ring
reconstructed data we also see lower estimated coefficients on the PDSI term suggesting that the
period from 1900-1940 was different in terms of how weather affected the banking system.
We had expected to see results for the pre-1900 period that were similar to those found in
the 1900-1940 period. However, this was not the case. A possible explanation is that a combination
of limited farming activity in some states in the early part of the sample and a less than fully
developed banking system in some western states early in the sample have biased the results. We
will try to explore this conjecture by breaking our panel into regional units.
Given our results for the US as a whole (or at least for our 42 States in our sample) we now
look at the different regions to see if there are regional differences in the effect of drought severity
on the rates of return to banks for our sample periods. These results are reported in Tables 5, 6, 7
and 8. In Tables 5 and 6 results are reported for the four major US Census sub-regions of the
Northeast, the Midwest, the South, and the West. The results show that the biggest effect of drought
on banking stress can be found in the Midwest with a one unit increase in the drought index causing
upwards of a 100 basis points increase in the rate of return to bank capital. Again, we see that this
6

The data on the reconstructed PDSI runs from 1850 until 1976 but the sample period for the rate of return on bank
capital varies by State. Therefore we have an unbalanced panel when using pre-1900 data. Most State rate of return data
start in the late 1860’s but some States only have data from 1890.

20

result is biggest during the period from 1900-1940. Table 6 reports the results from the quadratic
specification for those regions where the quadratic term was significant at the 10% level. Unlike the
earlier results for the whole sample, we do not find a consistent non-linear relationship. However,
for the Midwest region we see the same pattern with a large positive coefficient on PDSI and a
smaller, but significant, negative coefficient on the PDSI2.
One interesting point is that there is a significant effect of drought on rates of return for the
pre-1900 period for the South but not for other regions. The result is not a complete surprise. The
South was more dependent on agriculture than the Northeast or Midwest, and hence more likely to
be affected by a droughts that reduced farm incomes. Indeed, Davis, Hanes, and Rhode (2009) show
that the cotton crop was an important determinant of the business cycle in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. In some of the western areas of new settlement that were highly dependent
on agriculture, moreover, we have fewer observations because the national banks came in only after
economic development could support larger banks. The expectation that drought related banking
problems should have been greater before 1900 than after may be based on the idea that the internal
capital market of the United States was completely integrated after 1900. As shown by LandonLane and Rockoff (2007), however, tight integration seems better identified with the post World
War II era.
Finally, we break the regions up into smaller Census divisions and report these results in
Tables 7 and 8.7 We report only those divisions making up the center of the country (coefficients for
other regions were uniformly insignificant) and see substantial effects, although even in these
mainly farming states the effect varies from region to region. The West North Central region had the
biggest effect of drought on rates of return to bank capital. During the period 1900 to 1940 a one
unit increase in the drought index increased the rate of return to bank equity by 100 basis points.
7

For these regressions the clusters are the individual States.

21

And there was a non-linear effect for this division: at severe levels of drought the effect of
additional drought was larger. We do not see a significant effect for this region in the 1850-1900
period. As our qualitative discussion of Kansas in the 1890s showed, it is likely that there were
effects, but the absence of long runs of data in this region, which was a region of new settlement,
means that it is hard to detect the effects econometrically. We also find strong effects of drought for
the East North Central and East South Central regions for the period 1900-1940, and for the West
South Central for the 1940-1976 period. We had expected to see a strong effect for this region
before World War II because this was the region hit by the dustbowl. This region, however, also
includes Texas and Louisiana. It may be that the effects of the dustbowl are being obscured by the
inclusion of neighboring areas that did relatively well during the Depression because of the growth
of petrochemicals or for other reasons. It may also be, as suggested by our case study of Oklahoma,
that the damage was concentrated in the state banks, and that the shift of funds from the state banks
to the national banks, offset some of the pressures on the sector that is the source of our data. Our
results, to sum up, suggest that drought affected the rates of return to bank capital and in some cases
this effect was economically significant. We find that the effect was largest in the early Twentieth
Century and in the Midwest.

The Effect of Drought on Farm Foreclosures
Drought (or excessive rainfall) is likely to affect the banking system by reducing farm
incomes and reducing the servicing of loans to farmers, so it is important to check the internal links
in the chain connecting drought with bank returns. Using data from 1926 to 1948 on the number of
farm foreclosures per 1000 farms we estimated a panel regression with foreclosures as the
dependent variable and the atmospheric PDSI as the independent variable. The results from these

22

regressions can be found in Table 9. The results here are consistent with the results from the rates of
return on bank capital regressions in that there appears to a significant and non-linear effect on
foreclosures for the whole panel and that the region with the biggest effect is the Midwest. When we
go to the finer census divisions we see that the largest effects were in the East North Central and
West North Central regions. Both regions also show substantial quadratic effects, although the
quadratic coefficient is statistically significant only for the wheat growing West North Central
states. In this region a one unit decrease in PDSI caused an increase in farm foreclosures of about 4
per 1000 farms.

The Effect of Drought on Farm Income
To fill in another link in the chain connecting drought and bank stress we also looked at the
relationship between drought and farm income for the period 1926 to 1948. The results of these
regressions are shown in Tables 10 (nominal farm incomes) and 11 (real farm incomes).8 Although
it makes more sense in most situations to expect real shocks such as drought to affect real variables,
here the affects on nominal income are of interest because farm loans were fixed in nominal terms.
Once more we see significant effects for the United States as a whole both in the regressions
explaining nominal income and the regressions explaining real income. If we look at finer census
divisions and focus on nominal farm incomes (Table 10) we see significant linear effects in all of
the central farming regions. If we focus on real farm income (Table 11) we find statistically
significant linear effects of drought in the East North Central and West South Central regions. The
estimated effect is actually largest for the West North Central region although it is not statistically
significant.

8

To get real farm incomes we simply deflated nominal incomes by the GDP deflator. This procedure adjusts for broad
movements affecting the whole economy, but not for interregional variations.

23

Conclusions and Conjectures
Did drought or excessive rainfall produced distress in the U.S. banking system? In many
cases it did. We explored two of the famous historical cases, Kansas after the Civil War and
Oklahoma during the dustbowl of the 1930s, in some detail. In both cases there were several factors
at work producing distress in the banking system, but drought made things worse. To explore the
relationship between drought and banking stress more systematically we turned to panel data
regressions relating rates of return to bank equity (a sensitive measure of the challenges facing a
banking system) to the Palmer Drought Severity Index and where appropriate to estimates of the
Palmer index derived from data on the thickness of tree rings. These regressions also revealed many
statistically and economically significant relationships, although the relationships were found only
in the central farming regions. We also tested in the interwar years for relationships between
drought and farm income, and drought and farm mortgage foreclosures. Again we found statistically
and economically significant relationships for the central farming regions. Thus, for some regions
and periods, we can trace a chain running from drought to farm income to farm foreclosures to bank
stress.
While the evidence for climate related banking distress is clear, we also found evidence of
adaptation. Our case studies showed that a combination of climatic and macroeconomic
disturbances could stagger a state banking system for a time, but also that people and institutions
adapted. Farmers began to grow new crops, turned to grazing, or simply moved on to other
activities or other places; bankers learned to finance less vulnerable sectors of the economy. Our
econometric evidence shows that climate related bank stress was more important prior to 1940. The

24

declining role of agriculture and the increased integration of financial markets in the postwar era
seem to have cushioned local banks from the full effects of local climate shocks after 1940.
Our results may provide some useful lessons as global warming begins to take a larger toll.
One implication may be that large branch banking systems are better able to sustain localized
drought induced economic stress than smaller systems. This consideration argues against recent
calls for breaking up large banks on the grounds that it would be easier to avoid the adverse
incentive effects of "too big to fail." The argument for breaking up large banks is that when banks
know they are too big too fail they take excessive risks. However, big banks that branch across
regions, as the larger American banks now do, or as the Canadian banks did throughout their
history, may be better able to offset temporary regional losses resulting from droughts or excessive
rainfall with surpluses earned in other regions.
The American experience, ironically, may have special relevance for small nations facing
the problem of climate stress. The American states, in the periods we examined, in many ways
resembled small open economies linked by fixed exchange rates and free trade. Each state,
however, had its own banking system. An adverse climatic event, if piled on top of a general
economic depression, had the potential to create severe stress within the local banking system. The
creation of the Federal Reserve, which produced high-powered money acceptable in all states,
ameliorated the problem. Branch banking that linked the banks in vulnerable states to larger national
systems also contributed to breaking the relationship between local droughts and banking market
stress. The analogs in the international sphere would be multinational banks that branched into small
nations, and international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank that helped integrate financial markets. Perhaps there is a lesson here for policymakers

25

wrestling with the question of how best to prepare small open economies for the risks of climate
related banking problems.
