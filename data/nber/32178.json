    "abstract": "\n\nShared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) are perhaps the most influential economic policy analyses today. My paper evaluates their development, natural associations, logical consequences, and economic identification. All five SSP baseline scenarios are predicting scenarios that historical time-series analysis would consider empirically highly implausible. This alternative \u2014 econometric time-series analysis based on worldwide IPAT components \u2014 suggests alternative emission scenarios, mapping into expected radiative forcing of about RCP 6.5, with a reasonable plausibility range from RCP 4.5 to RCP 7.0.\n\n",
