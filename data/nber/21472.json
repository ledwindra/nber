    "abstract": "\n\nUsing firm-level data, we document two new facts regarding intrafirm trade and the activities of the foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational corporations. First, intrafirm trade is concentrated among a small number of large affiliates within large multinational corporations; the median affiliate ships nothing to the rest of the corporation. Second, we find that the input-output coefficient linking the parent\u2019s and affiliate\u2019s industries of operation\u2014a characteristic commonly associated with production fragmentation\u2014 is not related to a corresponding intrafirm flow of goods.\n\n",
