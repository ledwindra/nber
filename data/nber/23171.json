    "abstract": "\n\nIn an effort to address the opioid epidemic, a majority of states have recently passed some version of a Naloxone Access Law (NAL) and/or a Good Samaritan Law (GSL).  NALs allow lay persons to administer naloxone, which temporarily counteracts the effects of an opioid overdose; GSLs provide immunity from prosecution for drug possession to anyone who seeks medical assistance in the event of a drug overdose.  This study is the first to examine the effect of these laws on opioid-related deaths.  Using data from the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files for the period 1999-2014, we find that the adoption of a NAL is associated with a 9 to 11 percent reduction in opioid-related deaths.  The estimated effect of GLSs on opioid-related deaths is of comparable magnitude, but not statistically significant at conventional levels.  Finally, we find that neither NALs nor GSLs increase the recreational use of prescription painkillers.\n\n",
