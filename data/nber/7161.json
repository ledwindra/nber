    "abstract": "\n\nCentral bank credibility plays a pivotal role in much of the modern literature on monetary policy, yet it is difficult to measure or even assess objectively.  A survey of central bankers was conducted to determine their attitudes on two important issues: why credibility matters, and how credibility can be built.  The central bankers' answers are compared with the responses of NBER-affiliated macro and monetary economists.  The two groups agree much more than they disagree. They are particularly united in their evaluations of ways to make a central bank credible -- assigning high ratings to the central bank's track record and low ratings to theoretical ideas like precommitment and incentive-compatible contracts.\n\n",
