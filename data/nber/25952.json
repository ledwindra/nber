    "abstract": "\n\nWe study optimal product market interventions in an unequal economy in which \ufb01rm ownership is concentrated and markups increase with \ufb01rm market shares. We characterize optimal regulation in a static Mirrleesian setting in which we impose no constraints on the shape of interventions, and take into account their general equilibrium and distributional e\ufb00ects. We \ufb01nd that optimal regulation improves allocative e\ufb03ciency, thereby increasing product market concentration. Though it leads to greater inequality, optimal regulation increases the equilibrium wage, bene\ufb01ting most households. This result extends to a dynamic setting with capital and wealth accumulation.\n\n",
