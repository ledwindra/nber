    "abstract": "\n\nWe study priority-based assignment problems with distributional and diversity objectives. Our work provides an axiomatic characterization of a general class of choice rules which are based on type-specific reserves and quotas. The choice rules in the class differ by the order in which applicants are considered for units reserved for different types. We show that a particular reserves- and quotas-based choice rule, where all applicants are first considered for units reserved for their own types, uniquely minimizes priority violations in this class.\n\n",
