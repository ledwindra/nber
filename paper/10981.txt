Some New Variance Bounds for Asset Prices
Charles Engel
NBER Working Paper No. 10981
December 2004
JEL No. G12, G14
ABSTRACT
When equity prices are determined as the discounted sum of current and expected future dividends,
Shiller (1981) and LeRoy and Porter (1981) derived a relationship between the variance of the price
of equities, p(t), and the variance of the ex post realized discounted sum of current and future
dividends: p*(t): Var(p*(t))>= Var(p(t)). The literature has long since recognized that this variance
bound is valid only when dividends follow a stationary process. Others, notably West (1988), derive
variance bounds that apply when dividends are nonstationary. West shows that the variance in
innovations in p(t) must be less than the variance of innovations in a forecast of the discounted sum
of current and future dividends constructed by the econometrician, p^(t). Here we derive a new
variance bound when dividends are stationary or have a unit root, that sheds light on the discussion
in the 1980s of the Shiller variance bound: Var(p(t)-p(t-1)) >= Var(p*(t)-p*(t-1))! We also derive
a variance bound related to the West bound: Var(p^(t)-p^(t-1)) >= Var(p(t)-p(t-1)).

Shiller (1981) and LeRoy and Porter (1981) proposed a test for “excess volatility” of
stock prices, when these prices are determined as a discounted sum of current and expected
future dividends: the variance of the equity price, pt , should be less than the variance of the expost realized discounted sum of dividends, pt* . Subsequently, Marsh and Merton (1986),
Kleidon (1986), and Durlauf and Phillips (1988) criticized these tests, arguing that the test
requires that the stochastic process for dividends be stationary. Here we demonstrate that if
dividends are stationary or have a unit root, Var ( pt − pt −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt* − pt*−1 ) . That is, expressing
prices in first-differences, the Shiller-LeRoy-Porter inequality is reversed.
In a sense, the profession long ago resolved how to implement variance bounds when
dividends are nonstationary. Mankiw, Romer, and Shapiro (1985), and West (1988) introduce
volatility bounds that are valid when there is a unit root in the dividend process. The West test
involves a forecast of the discounted sum of current and future dividends constructed by the
econometrician (a forecast based on a smaller information set than the market’s), pˆ t . Under the
assumption that the econometrician has less information than markets, West shows that the
variance in innovations in pt should be less than the variance in innovations in pˆ t . Here we
also derive a variance bound that is similar to that of West (1988):

Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt − pt −1 ) .
It has been noted (by Frankel and Stock (1987) and Durlauf and Phillips (1988)) that the
variance bound is a weaker restriction than imposed by the standard Euler equation. But it has
been argued that variance bounds are nonetheless interesting because they provide some insight
into why the Euler condition might fail. For example, Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997, p.

1

277) state, “The justification for using a variance-bounds test is not increased power; rather it is
that a variance-bounds test helps one to describe the way in which the null hypothesis fails.”
In that spirit, there may be some value in re-examining the Shiller-LeRoy-Porter variance
bounds test. Shiller (1991) in particular argues for the intuitive appeal of his bound,

Var ( pt* ) ≥ Var ( pt ) , by asking readers to examine graphs of pt* and pt . As Shiller says (p. 421),
“One is struck by the smoothness and stability of the ex post rational price series pt* when
compared with the actual price series.” Flavin (1983), and especially Kleidon (1986), argued
that this interpretation of the graphs was inconclusive. Just because pt* appears smoother does
not mean it has lower variance, when the dividend process is very persistent. The subsequent
exchange between Shiller (1988) and Kleidon (1988) demonstrates that the issue was not fully
resolved. The result in this paper formalizes the observation that volatility of pt compared to

pt* does not imply the present-value model is violated, in a very simple way. Given the nearrandom-walk behavior of stock prices, the “volatility” of the stock price is captured by

Var ( pt − pt −1 ) . But the high volatility of the actual stock price is not inconsistent with the
smooth behavior of pt* because we show here that the present-value model implies

Var ( pt − pt −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt* − pt*−1 ) .
This observation should not, however, revive hope for the contention that stock prices are
not excessively volatile. Both Mankiw, Romer, and Shapiro (1985), and West (1988) find their
variance bounds are violated in data for U.S. stock prices. We shall argue presently that the
results of West (1988) should persuade us that the second variance bound derived here,

Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt − pt −1 ) , will also fail.

Definitions and assumptions

pt ≡ E pt* | It .

pˆ t ≡ E pt* | H t .

It is the information set of the market. pt is the market price.
Ht is an information set, H t ⊆ It .

et ≡ pt − E ( pt | I t −1 ) . ft ≡ pˆ t − E ( pˆ t | H t −1 ) .

As in West (1988), we assume It is a linear space, spanned by the current and past values
of a finite number of random variables, and that I t ⊆ I t +1 . After s differences, all the random
variables in It jointly follow a stationary ARMA(q,r) process for finite s, q, r.
Assume that at a minimum, H t contains current and past values of dt .

West (1988) shows pt* − pt = ∑ b j et + j and pt* − pˆ t = ∑ b j ft + j
Comment: Shiller (1981) shows Var ( pt* ) ≥ Var ( pt ) when dt is stationary.
West (1988) shows σˆ 2 ≥ σ 2 when dt is a linear process integrated of any order.
Proposition 1: Suppose dt is I (1) or I (0) , and all of the assumptions above hold. Then

Var ( pt − pt −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt* − pt*−1 ) .
Proof: Var ( pt − pt −1 ) = Var ({E ( pt | I t −1 ) − pt −1} + { pt − E ( pt | I t −1 )}) = Γ + σ 2 , where

Γ ≡ var( E ( pt | It −1 ) − pt −1 ) . The last equality holds because et ≡ pt − E ( pt | It −1 ) is uncorrelated
with t-1 information.

Comment: Note the surprising relationship to the Shiller (1981) variance bound. Also note that
the proposition does not extend to the claim for all k > 0 , Var ( pt + k − pt ) ≥ Var ( pt*+ k − pt* ) . (See
the Appendix for counterexamples for k > 1 .)
Discussion of Proposition 1
For convenience, define ∆pt ≡ pt − pt −1 and ∆pt* ≡ pt* − pt*−1 . We see from the definitions
above that E (∆pt | I t −1 ) = E (∆pt* | I t −1 ) . That is, E (∆pt | It −1 ) is an unbiased (relative to the
information set I t −1 ) forecast of both ∆pt and ∆pt* . So, we can write:

Var ( pt* − pt*−1 ) = Var ( E (∆pt | It −1 )) + Var ( pt* − pt*−1 − E (∆pt | I t −1 )) , and

Var ( pt − pt −1 ) = Var ( E (∆pt | It −1 )) + Var ( pt − pt −1 − E (∆pt | It −1 )) .
Proposition 1, which states Var ( pt − pt −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt* − pt*−1 ) , is equivalent then to the statement,

Var ( pt − pt −1 − E (∆pt | I t −1 )) ≥ Var ( pt* − pt*−1 − E (∆pt | I t −1 )) .
That is, the market at time t-1, which has information It −1 , can make a better forecast of ∆pt*
than of ∆pt ! (Here, “better forecast” means a forecast error with lower variance.)
To understand this, first we see that of course the forecast error the market makes for ∆pt
is just its forecast error for pt , since pt −1 is in It −1 . That is,

4

Var ( pt − pt −1 − E (∆pt | I t −1 )) = Var ( pt − E ( pt | I t −1 )) = Var (et ) = σ 2 .
But in forecasting ∆pt* , we must recognize that neither pt* nor pt*−1 are in It −1 . The
forecast errors for pt* and pt*−1 are correlated – indeed they are perfectly correlated (as we show
shortly.) So, while the variance of the market’s forecast error of pt* is greater than the variance
of the market’s forecast error of pt , the variance of the market’s forecast error of pt* − pt*−1 is
much smaller than the variance of its forecast error of pt* -- and, as Proposition 1 implies, even
smaller than the variance of the forecast error of ∆pt .
To see this, use the fact that, from the definitions above, pt*−1 and pt −1 satisfy the
following relationships:

pt*−1 = dt −1 + bpt*

pt −1 = dt −1 + bE ( pt | It −1 ) .
Subtraction gives us pt*−1 − pt −1 = b( pt* − E ( pt | I t −1 )) . pt*−1 − pt −1 is the market’s forecast error of

pt*−1 at time t-1, and pt* − E ( pt | I t −1 ) is the market’s forecast error of pt* at time t-1. This shows
the forecast errors of pt*−1 and pt* based on I t −1 are perfectly correlated.
The variance of the market’s forecast error of pt* is given by
Var ( pt* − E ( pt | I t −1 )) =

Clearly the variance of the market’s forecast error of pt* is greater than the variance of the
market’s forecast error of pt . But, now consider the variance of the forecast error of ∆pt* :

5

Var ( pt* − pt*−1 − E (∆pt | I t −1 )) =
Var[{ pt* − E ( pt | It −1 )} − { pt*−1 − pt −1}] = Var ((1 − b){ pt* − E ( pt | I t −1 )}] =

1+ b
1 − b2

The variance of the forecast error of ∆pt* is less than the variance of the forecast error of pt* and

pt .
The intuition of Proposition 1 discussed here is in many ways similar to Kleidon’s (1986)
discussion of why it is misleading to draw inferences from the fact that the graph of pt* in Shiller
(1981) is smoother than the graph of pt . However, Kleidon did not consider models in which
dividends could follow general I (1) processes and did not examine the variances of differences
in prices, so the analogy to that discussion is imperfect.

Proposition 2: Suppose dt is I (1) or I (0) , and all of the above assumptions hold. Then

Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt − pt −1 ) .
Proof: Following the same steps as above, but replacing pt with pˆ t , we have

Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) = Γˆ + σˆ 2 , where Γˆ ≡ var( E ( pt | H t −1 ) − pt −1 ) , and

The inequality in this expression follows because West (1988) shows σˆ 2 ≥ σ 2 .
Comment: Note the relationship of this variance bound to that of West (1988). At first glance,
one might think that the two propositions contain the same result in the special case in which
6

dt = dt −1 + et . That is true, but only trivially. Because both Proposition 1 of West (1988) and
Proposition 2 here assume Ht includes current and past values of dt , we have in this case that

σˆ 2 = σ 2 , and Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) = Var ( pt − pt −1 ) . That is, any information in It that is not in H t is
not helpful in forecasting dt +1 .
Discussion of Proposition 2
∞

Think of pˆ t as the forecast an econometrician makes of pt* ≡ ∑ b j dt + j , based on a VAR
j =0

as in West (1988).
Consider the relationship between the forecast of ∆pˆ t ≡ pˆ t − pˆ t −1 and ∆pt . Following the
same logic as the Discussion of Proposition 1, we can write

Var ( pt − pt −1 ) = Var ( E (∆pt | H t −1 )) + Var ( pt − pt −1 − E (∆pt | H t −1 ))
Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) = Var ( E (∆pt | H t −1 )) + Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 − E (∆pˆ t | H t −1 )) ,
where we have used the fact that E (∆pt | H t −1 ) = E (∆pˆ t | H t −1 ) = E (∆pt* | H t −1 ) . The theorem then
implies that

Var ( pt − pt −1 − E (∆pt | H t −1 )) ≤ Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 − E (∆pˆ t | H t −1 )) .
Notice the comparison to the West (1988) result. Since pt −1 is in It −1 and pˆ t −1 is in H t −1 , we
can write West’s result that σˆ 2 ≥ σ 2 as:

Var ( pt − pt −1 − E (∆pt | It −1 )) ≤ Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 − E (∆pˆ t | H t −1 )) .
Another related paper is that of Engel and West (2004). They show that as b → 1 ,

Var[(1 − b)( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 )] ≈ Var[(1 − b)( pt − pt −1 )] . Their proof, however, takes a very different tack
than the proofs here. They show that as b → 1 ,

7

Var[(1 − b)( pˆ t − E ( pˆ t | H t −1 ))] ≈ Var[(1 − b)( pt − E ( pt | It −1 ))] . They then use the result from
Engel and West (2005) that as b → 1 , pˆ t − E ( pˆ t | H t −1 ) ≈ pˆ t − pˆ t −1 and

pt − E ( pt | It −1 ) ≈ pt − pt−1 to conclude that Var[(1 − b)( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 )] ≈ Var[(1 − b)( pt − pt −1 )] when
b is near one.
Now consider the relationship between the variance of ∆pˆ t and ∆pt* . Proposition 2,
combined with Proposition 1, give us

Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt − pt −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt* − pt*−1 ) .
This means that the variance of ∆pˆ t is an upper bound on the variance of ∆pt* . Even if the
present value model is not how the market prices equities, the econometrician can still calculate
an upper bound on the variance of the change in the ex post discounted sum of current and future
dividends.
As we have noted, the graphs of Shiller (1981) in essence confirm that the variance
bound of Proposition 1 is satisfied. However, the results of West (1988) in essence confirm that
the variance bound of Proposition 2 is not satisfied. The near random walk behavior of equity
prices means that Var ( pt − E ( pt | It −1 )) will not be too different than Var ( pt − pt −1 ) . Also,
West’s estimates show that dividends are nearly a random walk, suggesting that

Var ( pˆ t − E ( pˆ t | H t −1 )) is none too different than Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) . Given the gross violations of
the bound Var ( pˆ t − E ( pˆ t | H t −1 )) > Var ( pt − E ( pt | It −1 )) that West reports, we can quite
confidently hazard the guess that the bound Var ( pˆ t − pˆ t −1 ) ≥ Var ( pt − pt −1 ) will also fail.

Appendix
This appendix shows that we cannot extend Proposition 1 to k-differences. Specifically,
it is not true that for all k > 0 , Var ( pt + k − pt ) ≥ Var ( pt*+ k − pt* ) . First, we give a counterexample
when dividends are I (0) (specifically, when they are i.i.d.) Then, we show that when dividends
follow a random walk, it is true that for all k > 0 , Var ( pt + k − pt ) ≥ Var ( pt*+ k − pt* ) . However, we
then use the i.i.d. example and the random walk example to construct a case in which dividends
are I (1) , but Var ( pt + k − pt ) < Var ( pt*+ k − pt* ) .

Recalling that pt ≡ E pt* | It , and assuming that I t contains dt (and its past values), we

Then Var ( pt + k − pt ) > Var ( pt*+ k − pt* ) if and only if 2υ 2 >

counterexample to the proposition that for all k > 0 , Var ( pt + k − pt ) ≥ Var ( pt*+ k − pt* ) in the case
in which dividends are I (1) .
Note that Gilles and LeRoy (1991) construct an example (one with two sample points,
and a specific stochastic process for dividends) in which Var ( pt + k − pt ) ≥ Var ( pt*+ k − pt* ) , but
clearly that example does not generalize to all I (0) and I (1) processes.
Comment

It is straightforward to generalize Proposition 1 to show that for all k > 0 ,

Var ( pt + k − pt ) ≥ Var ( pt*+ k − pt* ) when It contains dt +k −1 and all dividends prior to t + k − 1 .
