ABSTRACT
Problems with mortgage financing are widely considered to be a major cause of the recent financial
meltdown. Several modern programs have been designed to mimic the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation
of the 1930s. The HOLC replaced the toxic assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions by
buying troubled mortgages and then refinanced the mortgages to allow home owners to avoid losing
their homes. We analyze the impact of the HOLC on the nonfarm rental and owned home markets
after developing a new data set for over 2800 counties in the United States. In counties with fewer
than 50,000 people, where financial markets were not as well developed as in larger cities, the HOLC’s
financial interventions helped stimulate the demand for owned housing more than it influenced the
supply. In rental markets the HOLC appears to have contributed to an increase in the supply of rental
housing that was likely associated the improvement of the balance sheets of lending institutions.

The Influence of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation on
Housing Markets During the 1930s
Problems with mortgage financing are considered to be a major cause of the
2007-2008 financial meltdown (Gorton, 2009). A large share of the “toxic assets” held
by financial institutions is composed of an admixture of credit default swaps insuring
collateralized debt obligations largely composed of mortgage-backed securities. As the
bailout of financial institutions starting in 2008 progressed, the government began
developing programs to refinance mortgages. Several programs were introduced in 2008
but were slow to get started. In February 2009, the Obama administration announced the
Homes Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which committed $75 billion to aid
up to 3 or 4 million at-risk homeowners in refinancing into loans with more affordable
monthly payments. Through January 2010, the HAMP had made offers of 1.3 million
trial modifications, over 940 thousand were active, 117 thousand modifications had been
accepted by loan service providers, and approximately 1,000 had been canceled. 1
How will programs like the HAMP influence housing markets in the longer run?
Since the program has several years to run, we will not know for some time. However,
we can begin to make forecasts about its impact by examining the impact of the Home
Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) on non-farm housing markets during the Great
Depression. The government allowed the HOLC to issue bonds to purchase from lenders
approximately one million nonfarm mortgages that were in danger of foreclosure
between 1933 and 1936; therefore, it replaced toxic assets with more secure government

4

bonds. In the process the HOLC refinanced the mortgages at better terms for a large
number of households that had been in danger of losing their homes. Despite the
improved terms, the HOLC eventually foreclosed on 200 thousand of the loans by the
early 1940s.
To date, discussions of the HOLC have largely been descriptive discussions of
overall macroeconomic effects (Grebler, Blank, and Winnick, 1956; Harris, 1951). Yet,
there was enormous variation in the distribution of HOLC loans and purchases that can
be used to identify the influence of the program on housing markets. To the extent that
the HOLC refinancing of loans prevented foreclosures, the program likely staved off a
decline in the demand for owned housing, prevented a surge in demand for rental
housing, and prevented an increase in the supply of both owned housing and rental
housing. In addition, the HOLC loan purchases provided more secure assets that could
be used as backing for more mortgage loans that would increase the demand for owned
housing, as well as make more construction loans that could lead to increases in the
supply of rental and owned-home housing.
To measure these effects, we examine how the distribution of HOLC mortgage
funds influenced the number of homeowners, renters, rents and the values of owned
homes in nonfarm housing markets in nearly three thousand U.S. counties in 1930 and
1940. Using estimates of the effects measured by reduced-form equations, we can
measure the summary effects of the HOLC on these markets and make some statements
about the relative size of the HOLC’s impact on supply and demand shifts.

We use an

instrumental variable approach to control for endogeneity of the distribution of HOLC
funds that might have arisen because the HOLC distributed more funds to areas with

5

more troubled markets. The results show no effect of the HOLC in a sample that
includes counties of all sizes. When the sample is limited to counties with populations
under 50,000, where financial institutions were more focused on local lending, the HOLC
appears to have propped up the demand for owned homes and stimulated the supply of
rental property.

HOUSING TROUBLES IN THE 1930S
Housing markets boomed in the 1920s, as building construction and housing
prices rose. The horizontal axis of Figure 1 shows the ratio of the value of owneroccupied housing in 1930 to the value of mortgaged owner-occupied housing in 1920 for
278 of the largest cities in the U.S. The average ratio across the cities was about 1.45.
Some cities experienced declines and one outlier in Rhode Island experienced a tripling
of prices. These ratios likely understate the boom in housing prices because HOLC
surveys of neighborhoods from the mid-1930s report the peak in housing prices as
occurring around 1927 in a number of cities (HOLC Area Surveys).
The boom was soon followed by a strong reversal as the housing sector was one
of the leading casualties of the Great Depression. Alexander Field (1992) argues that
housing markets actually played a key role in contributing to the downturn from 1929
through 1933 and acted as a drag on recovery of GDP and housing after 1933. Figure 1
shows that the housing markets where home values rose more in the 1920s tended to fall
more in the 1930s.

6

Nationally, housing markets did not recover to 1929 levels to the same extent as
the rest of the economy. At the national level, real average personal income and real
average retail sales had re-achieved their 1929 values by 1939, and this was true in a
majority of the states.2 In contrast, even though the overall CPI in 1940 was 16 percent
below its 1930 level, the nominal median value of an owned home in 1940 had fallen
48.6 percent below its 1930 value, and nominal median nonfarm contract rents for rental
property had fallen 24 percent (U.S. Bureau of Census 1975, 210-211). Meanwhile, ten
years of extra-ordinary unemployment had contributed to a decline in the home
ownership rate from 47.8 percent in 1930 to 43.6 percent in 1940. Figures 2 through 4
show that that there was substantial variation in the housing market changes in the 1930s.
In fact, there were increases in home ownership rates in several western and southwestern
states.

THE HOME OWNERS’ LOAN CORPORATION
The Great Contraction from 1929 through 1933 led to a 30- to 40-percent fall in
housing prices, a large number of failures of financial institutions, and a sharp rise in
mortgage foreclosures. In response, a large number of states adopted mortgage moratoria
that prevented foreclosures. As part of the broad range of New Deal programs
established during their First Hundred Days in office, the Roosevelt Administration
adopted the HOLC to aid home owners “in hard straits largely through no fault of their
own (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1937, 28).” There were plenty who fit this
description because 25 percent of the workforce was unemployed and many others were
working less than full time. Between 1933 and 1936 (mostly in 1933 and 1934) the

7

HOLC used bonds to purchase 1,017,827 troubled mortgage loans with an average value
of $3,039 ($48,865 in 2008 dollars) from lenders and then refinanced the loans on better
terms for borrowers (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1939, 125; (Harris 1951, 1) The
HOLC rejected over 800 thousand applications, some because the household was not in
dire need, others because the borrower was not likely to repay the loan.
The HOLC loans to troubled borrowers more closely resembled modern
amortized long-term mortgages than the loans they replaced. Prior to the 1930s most
mortgagees were required to place large down payments of between 40 to 60 percent of
the property value. The typical mortgage loan required repayment of interest for five
years with a balloon payment of the principal at the end of five years. Most loans were
refinanced at the end of the five year period. Opportunities to obtain amortized loans
were available from some types of lenders. For example, a number of Building and
Loans offered a “Philadelphia plan,” in which a second amortized mortgage was issued
for 30 percent of the value of property after the original loan was obtained. The borrower
then repaid interest only on the first loan and the amortized amount on the second
mortgage for five years and then could refinance the principal into an amortized loan
through the Building and Loan.3
The HOLC replaced the five year interest-only loans with fifteen year amortized
loans in which the borrower made equal payments throughout the life of the loan. The
loan to value ratio was allowed to rise from the traditional 50 percent of the value of the
home to 80 percent. In many cases the 80 percent figure was applied to the value of the
home from better times, so the true percentage loaned on the value of the house was
much higher (Rose, 2009, Harris, 1951, 25). The interest rate on the loans was 5 percent

8

when low risk private home loans were offered at 6 to 7 percent.4 Borrowers could opt to
pay interest only for the first three years of the loan and there was no prepayment penalty.
The typical mortgage refinanced by the HOLC in 1933 was more than two years
in default on the principal, due to a combination of forebearance by lenders and state
mortgage repayment moratoria. In addition, the typical loan refinanced had not paid
taxes on the property for two to three years (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1938, 27).
The HOLC paid delinquent taxes and by 1937 had reconditioned about forty percent of
the homes while folding the costs into the principal of the mortgage (Federal Home Loan
Bank Board 1938, 29).
People who anticipated that the HOLC would fully resolve the problem likely
were disappointed. The mortgage foreclosure rate only fell slightly over the next three
years. In June 1936 39.4 percent of the HOLC borrowers were more than three months
behind on their mortgage payments (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1937, 28). By
1940 the HOLC had foreclosed on 17 percent of its loans. Most of those foreclosures
occurred after delinquencies in both principal and interest had run for more than 18
months with taxes unpaid (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1937, 28). At some point
between 1936 and 1940, the HOLC owned and then resold roughly 2 percent of the
owner-occupied nonfarm dwellings in the United States. The foreclosed dwellings were
eventually sold off at an average loss of 33 percent per foreclosure, as the HOLC sought
to avoid roiling housing markets with their sales (Comptroller General of the United
States 1950, 11). Based on current mark-to-market accounting standards for financial
institutions it is very likely that the HOLC would have been considered insolvent in the
late 1930s.

9

The HOLC benefitted many home owners who had been in dire straits and the
absence of a prepayment penalty allowed many to repay the loan long before the fifteen
year period of the loan had ended. When the HOLC was closed down after the last loan
was repaid in 1951, the auditor reported that the HOLC had paid net earnings to the U.S.
Treasury of $13.994 million between its inception and June 30, 1952. However, the
auditor suggested that the net earnings should not be considered profit. The cost to the
Treasury of supplying funds to the Corporation since 1933 was about $91.9 million, so
“the net overall cost to the Government has been about $78 million (Comptroller General
of the United States 1953, 9). Since the HOLC had added nearly $60 million to its
balance sheet through investments in savings and loans and in the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Company, the losses on the HOLC program were probably closer to or
more than $100 million.5
ANTICIPATED EFFECTS OF THE HOLC
The annual reports about the HOLC suggest that the program was designed to
achieve two goals. First, it should insure that homeowners who were in danger of
defaulting on their mortgages through “no fault of their own” would be allowed to stay in
their homes. Second, by buying the weakened mortgages from mortgage lenders,
typically with government bonds, the HOLC was injecting more capital into the lending
markets that could insure a continued flow of funds for lending in mortgage markets,
residential building, or other types of lending.
Consider the impact of these factors in a demand and supply framework for
owned homes and rentals in these local areas. The predictions described here rely on the

10

following assumptions. In each year households make the decision whether to move or
stay in their current dwelling; therefore, the entire stock of housing is included in the
supply and demand analysis for owned housing and rental housing markets. Holding
other factors constant, the supplies of owned housing and rental housing have positive
slopes, and the demands for each have negative slopes. Even though there is a reasonable
degree of substitutability between owned housing and rental housing, there are quality
differences in the housing associated with tenure. Thus rents on rental housing and the
values of owned homes do not move in lock-step and can even move in different
directions when demand and supply shifters in the two markets dictate such a change.
In the owned home market the HOLC potentially had multiple effects on both the
demand and supply side of the market. On the demand side of the market, more HOLC
financing directly propped up the demand for housing in multiple ways. First, by
offering lower interest rates, higher loan to value ratios, and a longer, amortized
repayment structure, the HOLC provided troubled borrowers with the funds to stay in
their homes. Even in good times, modern studies have shown that relaxation of credit
constraints can have a significant impact on the transition to home ownership.6

Second,

lower interest rates lowered the discount rate used by home buyers and stimulated
demand for owned housing by raising the present value of the stream of benefits from the
home. Finally, HOLC funds were also used to improve the quality of housing, which in
turn, raised the demand for housing.7
On the supply side of the market the HOLC relaxed credit constraints on lending
by replacing toxic assets with safer HOLC bonds in the lenders’ asset portfolios. To the

11

extent that the HOLC bonds underwrote construction loans, the supply of housing for
ownership would have increased.
After combining these multiple effects, the HOLC loans are anticipated to have
stimulated the demand for owned housing, which would have increased values of owned
homes and the number of home owners. They also might have stimulated supply, which
would have raised the number of home owners and led to lower owned home values.
The combined effects would have led to an increase in the number of homeowners and an
uncertain effect on price. Prices would have risen if the demand rise dominated the
supply rise, fallen if the supply rise dominated the demand rise, and stayed the same if the
two shifts offset each other.
In rental markets, the HOLC loans would have been associated with a reduction in
demand for rental housing by reducing the number of foreclosure households entering
rental markets. On the supply-side, the HOLC also would have reduced the amount of
foreclosed property that was temporarily for rent until it could be sold. As a
countervailing force on the supply side, the HOLC’s purchase of mortgages would have
freed up more capital for the construction of rental housing that would have increased the
supply of rental housing. The summary effects of the HOLC in the rental market would
have been to reduce demand for rental housing and have conflicting effects on the
supply-side of the equation. Had the demand change associated with the HOLC
dominated, the HOLC would have been associated with lower rents and fewer renters. If
the supply reduction dominated, the HOLC would have been associated with higher rents
and fewer renters. If the supply increase dominated, the HOLC would have been
associated with lower rents and more renters.

12

The HOLC’s impact on these markets would have been diminished to the extent
that the HOLC was forced to foreclose on properties itself. We know that nationwide the
HOLC foreclosed on 17 percent of the properties on which it made loans in the 1930s.
To the extent that the distribution of foreclosures was the same as that of the flow of
HOLC funds, holding constant the other factors in the regression, the effect of the HOLC
on the various housing outcome variables should be dampened but the signs not affected.

DATA
The data set used to study the impact of the HOLC is composed of information
from 2854 counties that reported information on all of the following housing variables in
the 1920 Integrated Public Microdata Sample, and 1930 and 1940 population and housing
censuses (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1933, 1943): median contract rents for non-farm
rentals in 1930 and 1940, median values of nonfarm owned homes in which the owners
lived in 1930 and 1940, the number of non-farm renters in 1920, 930 and 1940, and the
number of non-farm home owners in, 1920, 1930 and 1940. Information was reported
for some of these variables in the remaining counties, but we chose to focus only on
counties that reported all of the information so that the sample was consistent across
equations estimated. We focus on non-farm monthly contract rents and owned home
values because the HOLC was a non-farm program. The monthly contract rent included
related expenses, such as utilities and fuels only if they were included in the rental
contract. It also included non-cash rent payments (labor, goods, etc) that were converted
to a dollar amount. The full contract rent was reported, even when the tenant might have

13

been delinquent with the rent. The house values are the owner’s estimate of the sale
value of the housing unit. For single-family, non-farm houses, the estimates included the
value of the house and the land. For owner-occupied units that were part of a building
containing other households or businesses, the estimate included the value of only the
part where the household resided.8
The information on New Deal programs was collected and reported in mimeos by
the U.S. Office of Government Reports (1940b) and has been computerized and made
available at Price Fishback’s website at the University of Arizona.
(http://economics.eller.arizona.edu/faculty/fishback.asp) under Datasets from Published
Research Projects. Data on the housing value and most other correlates also come from
the 1930 and 1940 population censuses and are available in computerized form in ICPSR
dataset 2896 (Haines, no date). See the Data Appendix for further information on
sources.
EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE HOLC
To investigate the impact of the HOLC funds, we develop two groups of four
reduced-form equations that examine the relationships between HOLC funds and the
median value of owned nonfarm homes, the median nonfarm contract rent, the number of
nonfarm home owners, and the number of nonfarm renters, while controlling for other
correlates that were likely to influence nonfarm housing markets. For brevity of
exposition, we show the equations with owned home housing values as the dependent
variables. The equations for the other three housing measures have the same structure
but with different coefficients and error terms.

14

The first set of equations treats the analysis as a cross-section from 1940 with no
dynamic feature to show the results from a more sophisticated version of the types of
comparisons of means that were commonly performed for programs by New Deal
administrators to show the impact of their programs in the late 1930s.
HVi,40 = β1 HOLCi,33-36 + γ1 Xi,40 + α1Ss,40 + θ1,i + u1,i,40.

(1)

Where HVi,40,k is the median value of owned housing in county i in 1940. HOLCi,33-36 is
the annual value of HOLC loans distributed between 1933 and 1936 per person in 1930,
Xi,40 is a Mx1 vector of M measured factors, including other New Deal programs that
influence the supply and demand of rental housing and of owned housing in 1940. Ss,40 is
a 47x1 vector of time-varying state policies that were common influences on housing
markets in the counties in state s. The vector θ1,i captures a set of supply and demand
factors that are unmeasured, time-invariant, and idiosyncratic to each county. The error
term, u1,i captures stochastic error and other time-varying unmeasured factors. The
coefficient β1 measures the marginal impact of the HOLC spending on the housing
variable, γ1 is a 1xM vector of coefficients for the measured influences of the New Deal
and α1 is a 1x47 vector of coefficients for the state dummy variables.
We can control for the unmeasured, time-invariant county factors, θk,i by taking
difference between the values in 1940 and the values in 1930. We therefore estimate the
following equations.
ΔHVi,40,k = βk HOLCi,33-36 + γk ΔXi,40 + αk ΔSs,40 + Δuk,i,40.

(2)

15

Since there were no HOLC loans prior to 1930, the change in HOLC loans is the same as
the level of HOLC loans in 1933 to 1936. In the analysis, we capture the changes in state
tax and real estate policies ΔSs,40-30 with a series of 47 state dummy variables.
Since housing is one of the most durable of goods and there is considerable inertia
in housing decisions, it is likely that there will be strong persistence across time in the
housing measures.9 Therefore, we estimate a second set of equations to capture the
persistence in the nature of the housing markets across time by adding lagged values from
1930 to the analysis. It can easily be shown that if the structural owned home and rental
demand and supply equations that include past rents, owned home values, and the
number of homeowners and renters in one or more equations, then each of the reduced
form equations will be functions of all four of the past housing measures. Therefore,
each of the reduced form equations with persistence will take the form in equation 3. For
this example, the dependent variable is the owned home value in county i in 1940
(HVi,40).
HVi,40 = β1 HOLCi,33-36 + γ1 Xi,40 + α1Ss,40 + θ1,i + δ11 MRi,30 + δ21 Ri,30 + δ31 Hi,30
+ δ41 HVi,30 + v1,i,40.

(3)

Hi,30 represents the number of nonfarm homeowners, Ri,30 is the number of nonfarm
renters, HVi,30 is the median value of nonfarm homes and MRi,30 is the median rent on
nonfarm rental property. After differencing, the equation becomes

ΔHi,40-30 = β1 ΔHOLCi,33-36 + γ1 ΔXi,40-30 + α1 ΔSs,40-30 + δ11 ΔMRi,30-20 + δ21 ΔRi,30-20
+ δ31 ΔHi,30-20 + δ41 ΔHVi,30-20 + Δv1,i,40.

(4)

16

We calculated measures of the number of nonfarm homeowners and nonfarm renters in
1920 for the counties by aggregating up from the IPUMS sample (University of
Minnesota). Since the census of 1920 did not collect information on rents or home
values, we use annual earnings per employed wage worker in manufacturing as a proxy
for rents and home value.10

An Instrument for HOLC Loans
The differenced analyses above controls for many of the time-invariant features
that might have led to omitted-variables bias in the analysis. However, there still remains
the potential of endogeneity bias arising from the way the HOLC distributed its housing
loans. The HOLC bought and refinanced troubled loans. To the extent that there were
more troubled loans in areas where housing values and home ownership were falling in
the mid-1930s, the coefficient on the HOLC is likely to be biased in a negative direction
in the change in home ownership and change in housing value regressions. The bias in
the change in rent and change in renter equations is less certain because the distribution
of HOLC loans would have been influenced indirectly by what was happening in the
home ownership markets. If the number of troubled loans that drew HOLC attention in
the mid-1930s were associated with foreclosure trends that led to foreclosed homes
becoming rental property and to more renters, the HOLC spending would have been
related to rising rental demand and rental supply. The combination would have had
offsetting impacts on rents but would have been associated with more renters. Thus, the
endogeneity bias for the HOLC loans might have been positive in the number of renters
equation and uncertain in the rent equation.

17

To combat these potential problems with endogeneity, we sought an instrument
for the distribution of HOLC funds that is strongly correlated with HOLC funding but is
not correlated with the error term in the difference equations with state fixed effects
above. One way to approach this is through the administrative side. The HOLC
established 244 offices across the country with at least one in each state. Given the
paperwork associated with the loans and the inspections of property required, it seems
likely that it was more costly for borrowers who were more distant from the HOLC
offices to refinance their loans through the HOLC. It would be more costly to seek the
mortgage refinancing and more costly for HOLC workers to evaluate the value of the
property and administer loan information related to it. Therefore, as a start, we calculated
the difference in miles between the county seat of a county and the nearest county seat of
a county where the HOLC office was located. So that the value of the instrument would
have a positive relationship with the HOLC funds, we used the inverse of the distance.
There still remains a potential problem if the HOLC chose the office locations on
the basis of the number of troubled mortgages in the area. It is not clear how the HOLC
would know this information except through using information that we have already
included in the regression for 1930, which was the previous census period. Most of the
nationwide information that would have been available for 1933-1934 was not collected
until the New Deal programs like the CWA and the FERA collected information, and
they did not collect information on housing until 1934. The one area where they might
have an accurate assessment might have been the building permit information collected
by the BLS for over 200 cities.11

18

To avoid the potential problem of endogeneity in the choice of HOLC office
locations, we use an alternative strategy for picking offices as an instrument. As a
starting point for the location of federal offices in each state, a federal government that
was trying to minimize its administrative costs in each state would have started by
choosing to put an office in the state’s seat of political power, the state capital. The next
most likely location would have been the county with the largest population in the state,
so that they could reach the most people possible. Following the same strategy, if they
added another office in each state it would be in the second largest city. To add another
office, it would be in the third largest city, etc. In this alternative formulation, then we
developed an artificial administrative version of the HOLC that placed HOLC offices in
all state capitals and in the four largest cities in each state. After determining the distance
from the nearest artificial office to each county, we then chose the instrument to be the
inverse of the distance from the nearest artificial office in the state. In cases where the
office was in the county and the distance was zero, we counteracted this problem by
adding one mile to all distances before taking the inverse.12
The artificial geographic distribution of HOLC offices matches the actual
distribution to a reasonable degree. The actual HOLC offices were dispersed across 228
counties (some had more than one), while the artificial distribution puts offices in 204
counties. There are 137 counties that had an HOLC office and also would have had an
artificial office; 91 counties had an actual HOLC office but would not have had an
artificial office; and 67 counties had no HOLC office but would have had an artificial
office.13

The additional correlates in the analysis are listed in Appendix Table 1. The
HOLC coefficient estimates are therefore estimates of the relationship of the HOLC with
the housing variables holding constant a variety of measures of economic activity, the age
distribution, race, immigrant status, illiteracy, as well as other New Deal programs that
might have influenced housing markets. To the extent that there are feedback effects
from changes in the housing markets to economic activity and/or to the New Deal
programs, the coefficients of economic activity and of New Deal programs in the
equations might be subject to endogeneity bias. So far, we have been unable to develop a
full set of instruments that have enough strength to control for the endogeneity bias in all
of the programs simultaneously. In estimating the effect of the HOLC, we chose to
control for potential omitted-variable bias related to these programs by including them in
the analysis. There is a risk that endogeneity bias in estimation of the other New Deal
coefficients might spill over into the HOLC coefficient.14
RESULTS
Plots of the raw data offer a preview of some of the findings from the estimation.
The plots in Figures 2 and 3 suggest positive relationships between the average value of
HOLC loans per capita from 1933 through 1936 and both the median value of nonfarm
owned homes and the number of nonfarm home owners for counties with less than
50,000 people in 1940. The graphs focus on counties with less than 50,000 people so
that it is not dominated by a few very large cities that disguise the pattern. When the
plots control for a variety of unmeasured time-invariant factors by looking at the change
in home values and in the number of homeowners in Figures 4 and 5, the positive
relationship of the HOLC loans with housing values and number of homeowners is no

20

longer present. The same patterns are generally present in plots of median rents and the
number of renters. The estimation procedures go further by controlling for time-varying
covariates, persistence, and also by controlling for endogeneity using instrumental
variables.
The approach to the estimation that best matches what Roosevelt officials
typically followed in evaluating programs would be to run the regressions with the levels
in 1940 as a function of the HOLC per capita expenditures. This approach leads to the
conclusion that the HOLC worked well. The results in line 1 of Table 1 suggest that
areas with more per capita HOLC spending had higher home values and more
homeowners. The directions of change are consistent with a view that the HOLC raised
owned home demand more than it changed the supply of owned homes. In the rental
market areas with more HOLC spending had higher rents and fewer renters, which
implied that HOLC spending lowered the supply of rental housing by staving off
foreclosures more than it reduced rental demand. All of the coefficients are statistically
significant. The coefficient of 50.9 for home values implies that an extra dollar in annual
per capita HOLC spending was associated with home values that were $50.9 higher.
Elasticities estimated at the means are 0.08 for house values, 0.27 for the number of
owners, 0.05 for rents, and -0.24 for the number of renters.
The cross-sectional coefficients are potentially biased by endogeneity, persistence
effects, unmeasured time-invariant features of the housing markets that are not controlled
for in the 1940 cross-section. Courtemanche and Snowden (2009) show that HOLC
spending was distributed to areas with higher home values and with higher home
ownership rates. Therefore, the cross-sectional results for 1940 might be just mimicking

21

the positive relationships that originally influenced the distribution of HOLC funds in the
mid-1930s.
We estimated the 1940 cross section to control for persistence in the housing
market by including 1930 housing values, rents, nonfarm renters, and nonfarm
homeowners in each of the equations. When these factors are included in line 2 of Table
1, the coefficient of housing values falls below zero and the coefficient of the number of
homeowners is cut sharply and is no longer statistically significant. In the rental market
the rent coefficient changes sign so that the coefficients of rent and the number of renters
are both negative and statistically significant.
We also estimated the model to control for unmeasured time-invariant
heterogeneity by differencing between 1940 and 1930. These results, reported in line 3
of Table 1, show that HOLC spending was associated with lower housing values and
rents and had no statistically significant relationship with the difference in the number of
homeowners or renters. A similar set of results arise from the estimation when we
estimate a persistence model with differencing as in line 4 in Table 1. These results
suggest that the HOLC was associated with a decline in demand that was greater than the
rise in supply in the owned home market and a decline in demand that was greater than
the rise in supply in the rental market.
The results from the differenced models with and without persistence are still
likely to be affected by endogeneity bias if the distribution of HOLC loans was
influenced by the changes in the housing market between 1930 and 1936. Our
expectation is that the HOLC distributed more loans to areas with the most troubled
loans, and thus areas where housing values and the number of homeowners were falling

22

and where the number of renters was rising and rents were falling. We therefore
estimated the differenced models using the instrument based on the inverse of distance
from the nearest artificial office described above. Tests of the strength of the instrument
using the Kliebergen-Paap statistic suggest that strength of the instrument is not a
problem if we are willing to accept weak instrument bias of 10 percent in the IV
differenced estimation in line 5 and 15 percent in the IV differenced with persistence
estimation in line 6.
The results from the IV differenced estimation without taking persistence into
account suggest that the HOLC was associated with reductions in housing values and the
number of owners, reductions in rents and more renters. The estimation that deals with
unmeasured time-invariant heterogeneity, persistence, and endogeneity of the HOLC
fully is the differenced IV estimation with differences in housing variables between 1930
and 1920 incorporated. The results show no statistically significant effect of the HOLC
on housing markets. The coefficients are all relative small and suggest elasticities with
respect to the HOLC of -0.05 for housing values, 0.13 for the number of nonfarm
homeowners, -0.02 for rents, and 0.03 for the number of nonfarm renters.
The estimates in Table 1 include all cities in the sample. There were likely to be
differences in the responsive to HOLC changes based on the size of the counties. Even
as late as the 1930s, there were differences in access to capital markets based on the size
of the population in the county and state. There still remained significant variation
across states in the interest rates charged by banks on loans (Bodenhorn, 1996, 2010).
Further, many of the failures of banks and building and loans in the 1920s and in the
1930s were failures of relatively small institutions reliant on local lending. The smaller

23

was the population in the county, the less likely that the loan portfolio of local mortgage
lenders would be diversified across larger geographic markets or across a broader
economic structural base.
Although we include these factors as controls in the estimations summarized in
Table 1 for all cities, there is no consideration of how the HOLC coefficient itself might
vary across different county sizes. To explore what happens with smaller cities we have
re-estimated the models using various groupings of county sizes. The estimates for
counties with fewer than 50,000 people in 1930 are reported in Table 2. As we add
counties with increasingly larger populations to the sample of counties with fewer than
50,000 people, the results have a tendency to move in the direction of the results reported
in Table 1.

As was the case with the estimates for the entire sample, the coefficient

estimates and the implied shifts in demand and supply in the housing markets change
markedly as we add controls for persistence, difference the equations, and use IV
estimation. The IV estimates for the differenced models both with and without controls
for persistence in lines 5 and 6 have the same signs and are similar in size so we will
focus on the results controlling for persistence.
In counties with fewer than 50,000 people the point estimates of the coefficients
imply that a rise in demand was the dominant influence of the HOLC in the owned home
market.

The HOLC coefficients for owned home values and the number of homeowners

are both positive and statistically significant at the 10 percent level or better. The
elasticities with respect to per capita HOLC spending are 0.153 for the values of owned
homes and 0.111 for the number of home owners.

In the rental market, a rise in the

supply of rental housing may have more than offset a rise in the demand for rental

24

housing. More HOLC funds were associated with a statistically significant rise in the
number of nonfarm renters and a statistically insignificant decline in rents with respective
elasticities of 0.159 and -0.023.
In an independent study of the values of owned homes and home ownership rates
in the 1930s, Charles Courtemanche and Kenneth Snowden (2009) also find that the
HOLC was associated with higher values of owned homes. They use an alternative
measure of HOLC lending, the ratio of HOLC loans made between 1933 and 1936
relative to owned homes in 1930, and have some different control variables. They
estimate the relationship of the HOLC lending rate with owned home values and home
ownership rates in 1940 in a cross-sectional analysis that includes the lagged housing
measures from 1930. As an instrumental variable, they use a measure of whether the
county was within 30 miles of an HOLC office. Their results also show a rise in housing
values for smaller counties.15

CONCLUSIONS
Between 1933 and 1936, the HOLC purchased over one million nonfarm
mortgage loans from lenders and then refinanced the loans. Its dual purpose was to
replace the toxic assets on mortgage lenders’ books and to help homeowners who were in
danger of defaulting through no fault of their own stay in their homes.

If the HOLC had

worked as expected, the HOLC would have raised both the demand and the supply in the
owned home market and would have reduced demand and either raised or lowered supply
in rental markets.

25

If someone were to rely on plots of housing market variables in 1940 against per
capita HOLC spending in 1933-1936 or a cross-sectional multi-variate regression
analysis in 1940 with controls for economic activity and state policies, they would argue
that the HOLC was a success. In the nonfarm owned home market more HOLC loans
were associated with higher owned home values and more home owners. This would
imply that the HOLC stimulated a demand increase for owned homes that more than
offset any increases in the supply of owned homes. In the regression analysis of the
rental market, the HOLC loans were higher in areas with higher rents and lower numbers
of renters. Such a finding is consistent with a view that the HOLC prevented foreclosures
that would have driven rents down and the number of renters up.
The impact of the HOLC diminishes a great deal once we control for timeinvariant heterogeneity, persistence effects, and the endogeneity of the distribution of
HOLC funds. In the estimation including counties of all sizes, there are no statistically
significant effects of the HOLC.
There are institutional reasons to believe that the HOLC might have been more
effective in smaller counties where financial markets were more local and many financial
institutions were oriented to local lending and thus were less diversified across sectors of
the economy. When the sample is restricted to counties with populations under 50,000
people, the HOLC contributed to a rise in demand in the owned home market that more
than offset changes in supply in that market. Thus, the HOLC seems to have worked as
expected in the owned home market by preventing a drop in demand for owned housing,
although the elasticities of home value and the number of home owners with respect to
HOLC lending were each less than 0.16. In nonfarm rental markets in counties with

26

fewer than 50,000 people, the results suggest that a rise in supply of rental housing may
have more than offset changes in demand. The results suggest room for further research
on lending decisions made by the mortgage holders whose toxic loans were replaced by
HOLC bonds.
What lessons can we learn from the HOLC about how the HAMP program will
influence modern housing markets?

First, the HAMP appears to be moving faster than

the HOLC. The HOLC was created in June 1933 and did not make its first few loans
until late in the year, although it made the vast majority of its one million loans in the
calendar year of 1934. The HAMP was created in February 2009 and had offered about
400,000 modifications by mid-summer; it has offered 1 million modifications in its first
year, although only 116 thousand are finalized. Given that the HOLC had to build an
organization from scratch, improved communications technology, and the government’s
much larger role in modern markets, we might have higher expectations for the HAMP in
terms of speed of operation.
Second, we should expect that the HAMP will likely lose money in the long run
and experience periods where there are a significant number of people aided who are
behind on their new mortgages or defaulting. The HOLC loan program lost money.
Within 3 years of the start of the HOLC more than one-third of the borrowers who
received refinancing were behind by three or more months on their mortgage payments.
Within 6 years the HOLC had foreclosed on 20 percent of its loans and was heavily
involved in renting the foreclosed housing and trying to time the resales to avoid
influencing housing values. On the other hand, the current economic crisis is much less

27

severe than the Great Depression, which should aid in reducing the eventual number of
foreclosures that the HAMP will face.
Third, the effects of the HAMP might not be as strong as those of the HOLC
because the strongest effects of the HOLC were in smaller counties with less access to
deep financial markets in the 1930s. Local financial markets are much more tightly
integrated into the national and world financial markets in the modern era, and thus there
is much greater access to mortgage credit today throughout the country than in the 1930s,
even after controlling for the different severities of the crises. Finally, there are likely to
be effects on rental markets and other financial markets that are larger than might be
anticipated initially.

Notes. There were 2857 observations. Each level estimation equation includes the list
of correlates in 1940 or 1939 levels listed in Appendix Table 1. The level estimation
with lagged housing variables also adds the median nonfarm owned home values, median
nonfarm rents, the number of nonfarm homeowners, and the number of nonfarm renters
in 1930 to the list of correlates. Each differenced estimation includes the list of correlates
in change form in Appendix Table 2. The differenced estimation with lagged housing
variables also adds the changes in the annual average earnings of manufacturing wage
workers from 1919 to 1929, and the changes in the number of nonfarm home owners and
renters from 1920 to 1930.
The Kleibergen-Paap Wald rank F-statistics for the first stage test of strength of
the instrument is 19.39 for the IV estimation in line 5, and 10.03 for the IV estimation in
line 6. The critical value for the tests of weak instrument strength is 16.38 if one is
willing to accept a maximum of 10 percent weak instrument bias, 8.96 for 15 percent
bias, and 6.66 for 20 percent bias.

Data Appendix
The New Deal program information is from the U.S. Office of Government
Reports (1940b). The data on the nonfarm contract rents, sale value of nonfarm owner—
occupied homes, number of renters, number of owners are from the 1930 census volume
on Families (volume 6) and the 1940 census volume on Housing (U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1933, 1943) and in computerized form in Haines ICPSR 2896. The information
on the population, retail sales, wholesale sales, value of crops, mining output, and the
percents black, foreign-born, illiterate, urban, and rural nonfarm are from the 1930 and
1940 Censuses and are available in computerized from in Haines (no date). Information
on average annual manufacturing earnings in 1919 and 1929 used in the differenced
model with persistence comes from the 1920 and 1930 Censuses and is also available in
the Haines (no date) compilation of data. The variable was created by dividing total
wage expenditures by the average number of employees. For counties with missing
observations on manufacturing earnings, we inserted state averages. Information on age
distributions in 1930 and 1940 comes from the population censuses and in computerized
form from Gardner and Cohen (1992). The infant mortality rate information comes from
information on births and infant deaths from the volumes on births, deaths, infant deaths
and stillbirths (The U.S. Bureau of the Census, various years). Information on the
number of tax returns in the county for 1940 is from Rand McNally (1943); for 1930 it
comes from U.S. Bureau of Internal Revenue (1932). The difference in the infant
mortality Rate is between the years 1940 and 1933 to include information on Texas and
South Dakota, which did not report infant deaths and births by county until 1933. The
differences for the per capita measures of retail sales, wholesale sales, mining, and value

36

of crops are for the years 1939 and 1929. The mining information was collected from
the published Censuses of 1930 and 1940. Information on the location and timing of
introduction of HOLC offices was collected from the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation
Minutes from 1933 through 1935.

See Home Affordable Mortgage Program (2010) for program statistics through

January. Borrowers are considered at risk if they are 60 days or more delinquent on the
loan Zibel 2010). The loans eligible for the program are first-lien loans originated on
owner-occupied properties with unpaid principal balances of up to $729,750. Borrowers
must fully document income. The loan servicer performs a net present value test on the
cash flow from loans at risk of imminent default in two scenarios: with and without
default. If there is no fraud or contract prohibition, the lender is expected to modify the
loan if the modified NPV is higher than the unmodified NPV. Loan services are required
to follow a sequence of steps involving reducing the interest rate on the loan (to a floor of
2 percent) and then extending the term or amortization of the loan to 40 years, and then if
necessary forbearing the principal Homes Affordable Mortgage Program (U.S.
Department of Treasury, March 4, 2009). A Home Affordable Refinance program was
made available to 4 to 5 million homeowners whose loans are owned by Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. The borrower had to have a solid payment history and the home values had
to have fallen so that the loan to value ratios is now above 80 percent (U.S. Department
of Treasury March 4, 2009). Several other programs were announced in 2008 but seem to
have been more limited in scope. Hope for Homeowners (H4H) was passed in summer
2008 and took effect on October 1, 2008. It was designed to allow lenders to move
borrowers into government-insured loans while reducing loan balances to 90 percent of
the market value of the home.

Anticipated to help about 400,000 home owners over

three years, only one borrower had been helped by May 2009 (Christie, 2009). In the fall
of 2008 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced stream-lined procedures to shift several

55

hundred thousand borrowers who were more than 90 days behind on their mortgage,
living in the home, not in bankruptcy, and owing over 90 percent of home value into
mortgages with monthly payments equal to 38 percent of their monthly income. In
December 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced that it would
modify 2 million loans at a taxpayer cost of $24 billion to move the monthly payment to
31 percent of pre-tax income with lower rates, longer terms, forbearance on the principal.
By February 2009, most of the loans modified under the program had been held by failed
banks, although the FDIC had begun requiring that some banks receiving bailout funds
also use the program’s procedures (Keoun, 2009).

Glaeser and Gyourko (2001) argue that negative economic shocks lead to

decreases in housing prices that are greater in absolute value than decreases in
population. During the 1930s, nearly every geographic area experienced a negative
shock between 1929 and 1933 and despite recovery in real incomes to 1929 levels by the
end of the decade, the unemployment rate remained above 10 percent for the rest of the
decade. The comparisons here show that a severe negative shock can have a substantial
negative effect on housing values that can last for an extended period of time.

The Building and Loans combined two contracts to create an amortized loan.

One contract was the standard mortgage (interest only with balloon of principal) and the
other was a subscription to buy shares in the Building and Loan association in
installments that added up to the principal of the loan. The money for the shares went
into a sinking fund for the association, and after 11 or 12 years enough had accumulated
to cancel the debt on the principal. Since the borrowers were now members of the

56

association, the sinking fund feature created problems in the 1930s when many people
failed to finish paying into the fund. Those who were still paying in had to increase their
share payments to get the debts of the Building and Loan cancelled. This gave many
borrowers even more incentive to stop making share payments and many Building and
Loans were frozen and then worked to liquidate the loans and the real estate on behalf of
the members of the association. See Snowden 2009.

The HOLC’s shift to longer term amortized mortgages with lower down

payments coincided with and likely contributed to a shift in the terms in the entire
mortgage market. Data from Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956, 236) on loans for 1-to4-family houses made by commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and life
insurance companies show a 50 percent rise in the average contract length of loans and a
16 percent rise in the loan-to-value ratio between 1930-34 and 1935-1939. The average
nominal interest rate also fell by 12 percent (roughly one percentage point).
5

Cumulative earnings from interest and dividends from the HOLC’s $224 million

investments in Federal Savings and Loan Associations and state-chartered members of
the Federal Home Loan Bank System or insured by the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation added $44.8 million to the plus side of the HOLC balance sheet.
Dividends on investments in the FSLIC added another $28 billion from inception through
1951 (Comptroller General of the United States 1949, 6; 1952, 27).

See, for example, Englehardt 1996, Engelhardt and Mayer 1998, Haurin,

Hendershott, and Wachter 1997, Linneman and Wachter 1989, and Zorn 1989).

Instead of describing the HOLC as increasing demand with its loans, another

way to describe it is as reducing the supply of housing that would have been dumped on
the market through foreclosures, which would have driven home ownership values down,
the number of homeowners down, increased the number of renters, and potentially raised
rents. Thus, the causal effect of the HOLC through this mechanism would have been to
raise housing values, raise the number of home owners, reduce the number of renters, and
reduce rents.

For definitions of the variables, see U.S. Bureau of the Census, Housing, 1943,

Volume I, Part 1, pp. 1-7 and U.S. Bureau of the Census, Families, 1933, Vol. IV, pp. 511. The 1930 census asked questions about families, while the 1940 census asked
questions about dwelling units. Thus, the 1940 census contains information on vacant
dwelling units that are unavailable in the 1930 census.

Given the costs of moving, each homeowner’s decision to choose to stay in his

own home, purchase a new home, or move to a rental in the next year will be influenced
by his current status. Owners of rental property typically find it costly and time
consuming to change the property in ways that make it attractive as owned property, and
vice versa. Renters have more mobility but still face some costs to switch. In the
analysis data availability requires a ten-year lag. The persistence might be weaker across
a ten-year period, although cross-sectional regressions show a very strong relationship
between the 1940 and 1930 levels.
10

There was a 1920 mortgage census that collected information only on the value

of mortgaged homes and was limited in the scope of cities for which it reported

58

information. The 1920 census collected information on home ownership but the
published census did not report the number of nonfarm owners and the number of
nonfarm renters separately. Since the IPUMS sample is a one percent sample and the
number of observations of households in about half the counties is small enough there
may be measurement error.
11

We considered an alternative strategy in which we used the minutes of the

HOLC oversight committee in the National Archives to determine the date in which the
office first opened. The HOLC gave out loans in such a short period, we thought offices
that opened later would have been at a disadvantage in distributing loans. Here again,
there are worries that the date of opening was determined by the extent of problems with
troubled loans.
12

We experimented with different location algorithms starting with only the

largest city in each state, and then adding the second, then third, then fourth largest cities.
Using the four largest cities along with the state capital leads to the strongest instrument.
13

There was an HOLC office in the state capital in 37 of the 48 states, in 42

counties that had a state’s largest population, and in 37, 26, and 20 of the counties with
the second, third, and fourth largest populations respectively.
14

The New Deal program most closely correlated with the HOLC is the FHA

with a correlation between logged values of 0.5. Correlations with the other programs are
0.30 with the RFC, 0.176 with the public works and relief, -0.136 with the AAA, and 0.19 with the farm loans.

15

When we use the data set we created and use our instrument strategy in a cross-

sectional model for 1940 with lagged housing values in 1930, we find results that are
similar to those found by Courtemanche and Snowden (2009). The results are available
from the authors. Although they do not focus on rental markets, they do find that the
HOLC is associated with a rise in home ownership rates. Our results, in contrast,
suggest that the HOLC increases the number of renters by more than the number of
homeowners.
