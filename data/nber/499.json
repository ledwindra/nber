I shall argue that were inflation fully anticipated, it would be \"almost neutral\" provided (a) that the tax system were fully indexed and (b) that interest were paid on bank deposits (as to an increasing extent it is in the United States). However, unanticipated inflation may have significant effects.\n\n",
