Older Women’s Labor Market Attachment, Retirement Planning, and Household Debt
Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell
NBER Working Paper No. 22606
September 2016
JEL No. D91,J14
ABSTRACT
The goal of this paper is to ascertain whether older women’s current and anticipated future labor
force patterns have changed over time, and if so, to evaluate the factors associated with longer
work lives and plans to continue work at older ages. Using data from both the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), we show that older
women’s current and intended future labor force attachment patterns are changing over time.
Specifically, compared to our 1992 HRS baseline, more recent cohorts of women in their 50’s
and 60s’s are more likely to plan to work longer. When we explore the reasons for delayed
retirement among older women, factors include education, more marital disruption, and fewer
children than prior cohorts. But household finances also play a key role, in that older women
today have more debt than previously and are more financially fragile than in the past. The NFCS
data show that factors associated with retirement planning include having more education and
greater financial literacy. Those who report excessive amounts of debt and are financially fragile
are the least financially literate, had more dependent children, and experienced income shocks.
Thus shocks do play a role in older women’s debt status, but it is not enough to have resources:
people also need the capacity to manage those resources if they are to stay out of debt as they
head into retirement.

Older Women’s Labor Market Attachment,
Retirement Planning, and Household Debt
Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell

Economic research has shown convincingly that young and middle-aged women’s
attachment to the paid labor force has risen substantially over time in America. 1 To examine
whether this pattern might also characterize older women, this paper examines several cohorts of
older women in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to document the size of possible future
changes, and to pinpoint which groups might be most likely to extend their work lives. In
addition, we investigate what role debt might play in older women’s continued work. For this we
examine the 2012 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), which provides detailed
information on how older women appear to be managing their debt and their retirement planning
efforts. Our focus throughout is on descriptive analysis rather than proving causal links between
retirement and debt.
Our findings from the HRS show that recent cohorts of older women were more likely to
be working at both ages 51–56 and 57–61 than the earliest cohort of the same age, first surveyed
in 1992. 2 Effects differ significantly over time, in that the mean probability of being at work for
the baseline HRS sample age 51–56 when surveyed was 64.9 percent, and 54.8 percent for those
age 57–61. All subsequent cohorts displayed higher rates of work, particularly for the age 51–56
cohort, controlling for other factors. Thus, there is a rising probability of working among older
women across cohorts.

See for instance Goldin (2006; 2014) and the citations included therein.
The 51–56 age cohorts of women were surveyed in 1992 (the HRS baseline group, born 19361941), the 1998 War Babies (WB) group (born 1942–1947), the 2004 Early Baby Boomers
(EBB) cohort (born 1948–1953), and the 2010 Middle Baby Boomer (MBB) group (born 1954–
1959). The three 57–61 age cohorts of women were surveyed in 1992 for the baseline HRS
cohort, in 2004 for the WBB; and in 2010 for the EBB.

We also find that recent cohorts of women drawing near to retirement have more debt
than before, and this is positively associated with older women being more likely to work
currently, as well as to plan to continue to work in the future. Somewhat surprisingly, total debt
more than doubled in constant dollars, and older women were increasingly likely to hold
mortgage debt in excess of half their residential value in recent waves. Additionally, the
percentage of women having less than $25,000 in savings for recent cohorts is roughly double
that of the earlier cohorts.
We also draw on data from the 2012 NFCS to explore the factors associated with
retirement planning, debt and debt management, and an indicator of financial fragility. As shown
in previous work, planning for retirement is associated with better retirement security (Lusardi
and Mitchell 2007a, 2011a, 2014). Moreover, many people are found to pay high interest and
fees on the debt they carry, and debt is part of household balance sheets throughout the lifetime
and even close to retirement (Lusardi and Tufano, 2015; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2013). Correlates
of retirement planning include having higher income, more education, and greater financial
literacy for both age groups we evaluate (age 51–56 and 57–61). Factors associated with overindebtedness and financial fragility include lower financial literacy, having more financially
dependent children, and experiencing unexpected and large income declines. Accordingly,
shocks do play a role in the accumulation of debt close to retirement. Nevertheless, it is not
enough to have resources: people also need the capacity to manage those resources if they are to
stay out of debt and find retirement security at older ages.

Prior Studies
Many prior studies have explored American women’s labor supply patterns over time
(c.f., Goldin, 2006; Attanasio, Low, and Sanchez-Marcos, 2008; Michaud and Rohwedder,
2015). Yet there has been relatively little work focusing on cohort changes in older women’s
participation patterns and debt, as well as financial literacy. In this section we review relevant
literature on these issues.
Several authors have evaluated the links between debt management and financial literacy,
and they have concluded that the least financially literate incurred high fees and used high-cost
borrowing. The least financially knowledgeable also report that their debt loads were excessive
and they were often unable to judge their debt positions (Lusardi and Tufano, 2015, and the
references therein). This group was also more likely to borrow from their 401(k) and pension
accounts (Lu, Mitchell, and Utkus, 2010; Utkus and Young, 2011) and use high-cost methods of
borrowing, such as payday loans (Lusardi and de Bassa Scheresberg, 2013).
There has been some research linking the quality of financial decision making and age,
and the findings offer little reason for complacency. For instance, one influential study (Agarwal
et al., 2009) found that the quality of financial decision making fell at an older age in 10 financial
areas, including credit card balance transfers; home equity loans and lines of credit; auto loans;
credit card interest rates; mortgages; small-business credit cards; credit card late-payment fees;
credit card over-the-limit fees; and credit card cash-advance fees. Older persons pay higher
financial service fees and interest.
In the wake of the financial crisis, these age-linked patterns are now translating into an
awareness that older Americans are nearing retirement with increasingly concerning levels of

4

debt. 3 For instance debt held by borrowers age 50–80 rose roughly 60% between 2003 and 2015,
while aggregate debt balances held by younger borrowers declined modestly (Brown et al.,
2016). Much of this rise consisted of home mortgages, held by over half (55%) of the American
population age 55–64, and about the same fraction (50%) had credit card debt (Bucks et al.,
2009). Moreover, among people age 65–74, two-thirds held some form of debt, almost half had
mortgages or other loans on their primary residences, over one-third held credit card debt, and a
quarter had installment loans. In recent years, on average, older borrowers held substantially
more debt than did borrowers of the same age in the 1990s: for instance Lusardi and Mitchell
(2013) showed that the percentage of people age 56–61 having debt swelled to 71% in 2008, up
from 64% in 1992. Additionally, the value of their debt rose sharply over time. Median
household debt in 1992 was about $6,200, but by 2002 it had more than tripled. By 2008, it was
$28,300—more than quadruple the 1992 level.
Accompanying this trend has been an increase in the proportion of older Americans filing
for bankruptcy over time: people age 65+ are the fastest-growing group in terms of bankruptcy
filings, which stood at 2% in 1991 and rose to over three times that rate by 2007 (Pottow, 2012).
Credit card interest and fees were the most-cited reason for bankruptcy filings by older people,
with two-thirds of them providing this reason. 4 Moreover, there is also a continuing tendency of

Securian (2013), Lusardi and Mitchell (2013), and the references therein.
4
Other data sources confirm these findings. People age 55+ hold widespread credit card debt and
pay a great deal in fees for late payments and exceeding credit limits, and this at a time when
they should be at the peak of their wealth accumulation process (Lusardi, 2011; Lusardi and
Tufano, 2015). Data from the 2012 National Financial Capability Study highlighted that 60% of
pre-retirees had at least one source of long-term debt, and 26% had at least two. Nearly 40% of
pre-retirees used credit cards expensively, and the same percentage felt heavily indebted (Lusardi
and de Bassa Scheresberg, 2014). Other surveys suggest similar conclusions. The 2013 Survey of
Consumer Finances showed that family net worth—the difference between families’ gross assets
and their liabilities—generally increases with age, with a plateau or modest decreases for the

5

women filing for bankruptcy more often than men, and women report being overextended on
credit as the key reason for filing (Institute for Financial Literacy, 2011).
Another key factor spurring the increase in debt over time has been the much higher
prices paid by recent cohorts for housing, and their resulting larger residential mortgages. For
example, the median amount older homeowners owed on mortgages increased 82 percent from
approximately $43,400 in 2001 to $79,000 in 2011. Further, data show older consumers owe
more on their mortgages in relation to the value of their homes than their peers did a decade ago.
The outstanding balance on their mortgages relative to the value of their homes (debt-to-value
ratio) increased from 30 percent to 46 percent between 2001 and 2011 (CFPB, 2014). Until 2009,
single women—the fastest growing segment of the housing market—purchased more homes than
single men. Since, on average, women pay more for their mortgages than do men, it is
unsurprising that mortgage debt is reported to be especially high among older women (Drew,
2006; Clark, 2015; Cheng, Lin, and Liu, 2011).
A related point is that subprime mortgage lenders targeted minority, elderly, and female
buyers in the years leading up to the financial crisis. Prior to the financial crisis, female
homebuyers were 32 percent more likely to have subprime mortgage loans, despite having higher
credit scores on average (U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee, 2008). These mortgages,
which made up only 13 percent of all home loans but accounted for 55 percent of foreclosure
starts, left older Americans vulnerable, and when housing prices sharply declined many turned to
delinquency (Leland, 2008). This led to a fivefold rise in the serious delinquency rate between

oldest age groups relative to the near-retirement age groups (Bricker et al., 2014). The median
net wealth of near retirees (households headed by someone between the ages of 55 and 64) was
lower in 2013 than in 1989 (Rosnick and Baker, 2014).

6

2001 and 2011 for mortgage holders age 65–74 (CFPB, 2014), underscoring the risk of holding
such high levels of debt at older ages.
There is also evidence that rapid changes in housing prices altered older Americans’
labor market attachment. For example, Begley and Chan (2015) explored the relationship
between unanticipated changes in housing wealth, such as those experienced during the Great
Recession, and retirement behavior by examining how the variation in the timing of housing
price influenced work effort. They showed that women experiencing large negative housing
price shocks were 25% less likely to retire relative to those experiencing positive shocks.
Moreover, homeowners having mortgages were less likely to retire (if not yet retired) or more
likely to reverse retirement (if already retired). Farnham and Sevak (2016) found that people
responded to rising home prices by revising down their expected retirement ages. Specifically,
they estimated that a 10% real increase in home value reduced expected retirement ages by about
four months. One might anticipate that the mechanism worked in reverse when housing prices
fell during the financial crisis and thereafter.
The trend in debt is attracting increasing attention from the media, with recent articles
exhorting people to cut their debt as they near retirement (e.g., Derousseau, 2016). Additionally
the high and rising levels of household debt are increasingly troubling older persons as well
(FINRA, 2006, 2007; United States Government Accountability Office, 2015). For instance just
9% of workers in 2016 who described their debt as a major problem said they were very
confident of having enough money to live comfortably throughout retirement. Yet retirement
saving efforts are still lagging, according to the 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey (RCS)

7

(Blakely, VanDerhei, and Copeland, 2016). Instead, people who admitted they were undersaving
indicated that they would likely cope with the shortfall by either saving more or working longer. 5
In what follows we contribute to the literature by examining cohort changes in older
women’s work plans and debt burdens using the HRS, as well as the links between financial
literacy and debt stresses in the NFCS. Our results point to the need for boosting older women’s
retirement security and the important role of managing debt later in life.

Cohort Trends in Continued Work and the Role of Debt in the HRS
In this section we analyze distinct cohorts of older women observed in the HRS, a
nationally representative survey of respondents over the age of 50. Specifically, we focus on four
birth cohorts of women first surveyed when age 51–56, and three cohorts of women surveyed
when age 57–61, so as to evaluate each of them on the verge of retirement. We utilize extensive
information gathered by the HRS about these women’s current employment status and future
work plans, along with their sociodemographic characteristics, including marital and family
histories. In so doing, we evaluate whether there are statistically significant differences across
the cohorts after controlling for other factors. We also evaluate whether these factors are
correlated with anticipated future work. Finally, we evaluate the extent to which the older
women’s cohorts differ with regard to how much debt they held as they entered their 50’s. This
permits us to evaluate whether rising levels of debt might be significantly associated with plans
to continue working at older ages.
Cohort Differences
5

This is somewhat worrisome since some retirees indicate that they could not work longer
because they were forced to leave the workforce earlier than planned (for reasons such as health
problems or disability) (Banerjee, 2014).

8

For the cohort analysis, we examine four groups of women initially surveyed when they
were age 51–56, and three different groups age 5761. This is facilitated by the structure of the
HRS (see Figure 1), which periodically enrolls refresher cohorts over time. For the age 51–56
group, we include those first surveyed in 1992 (the HRS baseline group, born 1936–1941), the
1998 War Babies (WB) group (born 1942–1947), the 2004 Early Baby Boomers (EBB) cohort
(born 1948–1953), and the 2010 Middle Baby Boomer (MBB) group (born 1954–1959). The
three 57–61 age cohorts of women were surveyed in 1992 for the baseline HRS cohort, in 2004
for the WB; and in 2010 for the EBB. 6
Figure 1 here
Our empirical modeling in each case involves multivariate analysis of each respective
outcome variable (y) on a vector of cohort dummies, where the HRS baseline is the reference
category. The main outcomes analyzed are an indicator of the respondents’ current employment
status, and their estimated chances of working at age 65. In both cases, the estimated coefficients
on the cohort dummies refer to the differential behavior of subsequent cohorts versus the HRS
baseline 1992 cohort. In all cases we control for the respondent’s age, race (White vs other), and
ethnicity (Hispanic vs other). These factors are, of course, most likely to be exogenous to past
work patterns. We also control for the respondent’s years of education, whether she had
experienced marital disruption (ever divorced or widowed), whether she was in fair or poor
health, her number of children, and ratios of her household primary residence and other debt to,
respectively, housing value and liquid assets. These factors permit us to ascertain whether what
might appear to be cohort differences could instead be associated with differences in socioeconomic and demographic factors over time, including changes in financial markets and the

increased opportunities to borrow and take on debt. The entire sample includes slightly over
6,700 women age 51–56 and around 4,200 women age 57–61.
Our first set of results examines whether women reported working for pay at the time of
their interview, and Table 1 reports coefficient estimates of the linear probability analysis. Panel
A provides results for current work among the women age 51–56 when surveyed, while Panel B
looks at the same outcomes for the older age 57–61 groups. For both age groups, the first column
excludes debt to asset ratio variables, while the second two includes them to allow comparison of
results.
Table 1 here
Looking across the first three rows of coefficient estimates it is clear that, compared to
the first HRS baseline group, recent cohorts of women were increasingly likely to be working in
their 50’s. The mean probability of being at work for the baseline HRS sample age 51–56 when
surveyed was 64.9 percent, and 54.8 percent for those age 57–61. All subsequent cohorts
displayed higher rates of work, particularly for the age 51–56 cohort. For instance, younger WB
women age 51–56 had about a 7 percentage point greater labor force attachment, or around 11%
higher than the HRS reference cohort. Early Boomer women age 51–56 were 5.3–5.7 percentage
points more attached to the labor force, or 8% more than the HRS, while the older group (age
57–61) of Early Boomers had participation rates of 4.7–6.2 percentage points higher, or 8–11%
more than the HRS reference group. The younger Middle Boomers also were working more than
the reference group, with 3.8–4.5 percentage point greater employment rates, or 6–7% versus the
HRS reference cohort.

10

The measured effects are also robust to the inclusion or exclusion of the financial
variables, as are virtually all of the other coefficient estimates. 7 In other words, these estimates
confirm that the probability of working rose across the cohorts compared to the HRS baseline.
Nevertheless, the magnitudes were somewhat larger for the younger WB group, a bit less for the
Early Boomers, and smallest (though still statistically significantly different from zero) for the
MBB age group. Among the older women, the Early Boomers were substantially more likely to
be working compared to the baseline HRS.
Turning to Table 2, we see that among the HRS cohort, 22.5 percent of the younger age
group (51–56) and 23.4 of the older age group intended to still work at age 65. Interestingly,
there is no significant difference between the HRS cohort and the War Babies in terms of the
women’s plans to continue working, but both Boomer cohorts were significantly more likely to
say they intended to work at age 65, compared to the original HRS cohort. 8

Moreover,

intentions to work at age 65 rose over time. That is, the age 51–56 Early Boomers were about
3.6–3.7 percentage points (or 16%) more likely to work at age 65, where the Middle Boomers
were 7.7–7.9 percentage points (or 35%) more likely to plan to work longer, compared to the
benchmark. For the older group (age 57–61) the increase was similar in percentage points (4.7–
5.1) but as it was measured on a slightly higher base, the 20% increase was slightly lower. In any
case, the most recent cohorts for which we have data appear to be notably more attached to the
labor force into their mid-60’s. As before, comparing Panels A in Tables 1 and 2, we again see

7

In results not detailed here, we have explored additional models where we interacted the debt
variables with marital disruption to test whether including these terms alters the estimated cohort
effects. Doing so does not change conclusions reported in the text.
8
The reader is reminded that the question about chances of working at age 65 was asked only of
those working when surveyed at a younger age.

11

that the magnitudes of the cohort effects are relatively invariant to including additional controls. 9
Therefore little of what we have attributed to cohort differences is associated with more recent
waves of older women having more education, higher rates of marital disruption, and fewer
children.
Table 2 here
Impacts of Other Factors
We also seek to analyze the impact of other factors on women’s current and future work
patterns. Looking across Tables 1 and 2, we see that age is generally negative when statistically
significant, indicating that even within these narrow age bands, older women’s labor market
attachment does decline. Nevertheless the estimated age coefficients are only weakly significant
in Table 2 across the board, and not significant for the younger women in Table 1. Thus older
women’s workforce attachment does not decline in lockstep with age, by any means. Another
factor consistently significant and positively associated with work is years of educational
attainment, such that one more year of schooling is associated with a 3 percentage point higher
probability of women’s current work (Table 1), and a 0.8–1.1 percentage point higher chance of
working at age 65 (Table 2). Interestingly, women who were widowed or divorced (marital
disruption) are 6–8 percentage points more likely to be working currently, and they have an 8–9
percentage point greater expectation of working at age 65. Poor health is quite important in terms
of explaining work patterns for both age groups: those in fair/poor health were 28–30 percentage
points less likely to be working, and among workers, 10–14 percentage points less likely to
project that they would still be working at age 65. Accordingly, women in good health or better

with marital disruption to test whether including these terms alters the estimated cohort effects.
Doing so does not change conclusions reported in the text.

12

are much more likely to report they will remain employed at age 65. Finally, the number of
children has a significant negative effect on older women’s current employment but only for the
51–56 age group, and the impact is small (-0.9 percentage points).
What Role for Debt?
The last two rows of Tables 1 and 2 speak to the question of how debt is associated with
older women’s work patterns, a topic of substantial current interest (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2013).
Our findings indicate that mortgage debt, in particular, is associated with a higher probability of
women working for pay and expecting to be working at age 65. For instance, an increase of a
standard deviation in the ratio of mortgage debt to home value 10 in Table 1 is associated with a
3.4 percentage point rise (or 5%) in younger women’s anticipated probability of working at age
65. This is in line with Fortin (1995), who suggested that liquidity constraints related to home
down payments prompted many women to work more. The effect we discern here is
complimentary, suggesting that older women may defer retirement due to the need to help repay
their mortgage debt. The effect is even larger, at 5.5 percentage points (or 10%), for the 57- to
61-year-old group. The second debt variable we included in the model, the ratio of nonmortgage
debt to liquid assets, is generally small and not statistically significant across Tables 1 and 2.
To further examine the role of debt, we note that previous research has reported that
people are reaching retirement age today holding more debt than in the past. 11 Accordingly, we
devote some additional attention to various measures of older women’s debt and financial
fragility across cohorts in Table 3.
Table 3 here
10

A standard deviation in the ratio of all primary residential loans to primary residence value is
equal to 0.54 for the age 51–56 group, and 0.62 for those age 57–61.
11
See, for instance, Lusardi and Mitchell (2013); AARP (2013); Bucks et al. (2009); Butrica and
Karamcheva (2013); Copeland (2013), and Pottow (2012).

13

Results show that Baby Boomer cohorts are more likely to have debt later in life for both
age groups (51–56 and 57–61) compared to the baseline HRS cohort (Panel 1). Moreover, recent
cohorts have higher levels of total debt late in life (Panel 2). It is also striking that cohort mean
and median debt levels have been steadily rising over time. For example, while the median (p50)
debt of the HRS baseline was a little more than $15,000 for women age 51–56, this level almost
tripled for the Middle Baby Boomers ($43,200; all values are in $2015). Increases in debt are
even more striking for the older group of women age 57–61: the EBB cohort had almost eight
times as much debt as the baseline HRS cohort ($31,320 versus $4,175).
One reason for such a large expansion in debt is that households have taken on larger
mortgages in recent years. This is the pattern we observe for both of the age groups we examine
(Panel 3 of Table 3). Mortgages, along with loans related to the primary residence, not only grew
in absolute value but they also rose as a percentage of the value of the primary residence. These
ratios more than doubled for the older respondents: while the older HRS baseline cohort (age 57–
61) neared retirement with a ratio of mortgages and loans on the value of the primary residence
of 0.11, this ratio grew to 0.28 for the Early Boomers. Moreover, older women are more likely to
be in households where the ratio of mortgage debt to residential value has doubled, from 18% to
32%, comparing the Middle Boomers to the HRS baseline cohort. This implies that many older
women will need to manage mortgage debt well into their older years, consistent with the
findings reported by Lusardi and Mitchell (2013). In other words, during retirement, Boomer
cohorts will have to use their income and assets to repay debt, in contrast to the earlier cohort.
And even more striking is the fact that higher proportions of older women are in
financially fragile circumstances compared to two decades ago. Only 18% of the younger HRS

14

cohorts had less than $25,000 in savings, 12 whereas one-third of the MBB group reported having
so little savings (Panel 4). We conclude that higher debt levels in later life could well be
contributing to rising labor force attachment among older women.

Financial Frailty at Older Ages: Findings from the NFCS
To further explore how older women are managing their debt and retirement planning, we
draw on the 2012 wave of the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). 13 The overarching
research objectives of the NFCS are to benchmark key indicators of financial capability and
evaluate how these indicators vary with underlying demographic, behavioral, attitudinal and
financial literacy characteristics. 14 The 2012 NFCS is a state-by-state online survey of
approximately 25,000 American adults (roughly 500 per state, plus the District of Columbia) that
is representative of the U.S. population. 15 In order to thoroughly explore the financial capability
of Americans, the NFCS covers several aspects of behavior, including how people manage their
resources, how they make financial decisions, what skill sets they use in making these decisions,
and how they search for information when making these decisions (Lusardi, 2011).
Consistent with the HRS analysis above, we again focus on two separate age groups of
women in the NFCS: age 51–56 and age 57–61. There are over 1,800 observations for the first
12

13

Savings is defined as total net worth or total assets minus total debt.

The data are publicly available at http://www.usfinancialcapability.org/ The first survey was
fielded in 2009, and it is slated to be repeated triennially.
14
FINRA Investor Education Foundation commissioned the NFCS in 2009 in consultation with
the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the President’s Advisory Council on Financial Literacy.
The 2012 Study—similarly developed in consultation with the U.S. Department of the Treasury,
other federal agencies, and President Obama’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability—
updated key measures from the 2009 Study and deepened the exploration of topics that are
highly relevant for research and policy. Lusardi serves as academic advisor to the Study.

In our analysis, data are weighted to be representative of the national population as a whole in
terms of age, gender, ethnicity, and education, based on the Census Bureau’s American
Community Survey. However, breakdowns of sub-populations may not necessarily be

age group and around 1,300 for the second. The empirical analysis evaluates whether older
women tried to figure out how much they need to save for retirement, their perceived level of
indebtedness, and their financial fragility, which relies on respondent answers to whether they
could come up with $2,000 in 30 days if an unexpected need arose. 16
To this end, Table 4 displays descriptive statistics for women age 51–56 in Panel A, and
for women 57–61 in Panel B. Here we see that the sample is mostly married, white, working, and
has at least some college education. The older women (57–61) indicated they were more likely to
plan for retirement (or to have planned, if they had retired), but fewer than half (45%) had tried
to figure out how much they needed to put aside for retirement, versus 39% of women age 51–
56. Moreover, many of them indicate they are carrying too much debt (43% of those age 51–56
and 39% of those age 57–61) and that they are financially fragile (43% of the younger and 39%
of the older group). This is consistent with the HRS evidence showing high levels of debt on the
verge of retirement.
Table 4 here
Other indicators of financial distress are reported in Table 5. Results show that about a
third of women (age 51–56) are able to easily cover their expenses in a typical month, or have set
aside emergency or rainy day funds that would cover expenses for three months. NFCS data

The precise wording of the questions are (1) Retirement planning: Have you ever tried to
figure out how much you need to save for retirement? Or, if already retired: Before you retired,
did you try to figure out how much you needed to save for retirement? Possible answers: yes, no,
don’t know, prefer not to say. (2) Debt: How strongly do you agree or disagree with the
following statement: I have too much debt right now. Please give your answer from a scale from
1 to 7, where 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree and 4=neither agree nor disagree.
Possible answers: 1–7; don’t know, prefer not to say. (3) Financial fragility: How confident are
you that you could come up with $2000 if an unexpected need arose within the next month?
Possible answers: I am certain I could come up with the full $2,000, I could probably come up
with $2,000, I could probably not come up with $2,000, I am certain I could not come up with
$2,000, don’t know, prefer not to say.

confirms that mortgage debt and other debts turn out to be problematic for a relatively large
subset of women. Twenty percent of the female homeowners in the younger age group and 15
percent in the older age group report being underwater, owing more on their homes than they
thought they could sell them for. As far as non-mortgage debt is concerned, many women said
they did not pay off credit card balances in full (if they had them), and they engaged in many
costly credit card behaviors such as paying only the minimum due, using the card for cash
advances, being charged fees for late payment, or exceeding the limits. These findings
underscore the point that many older women are exposed to illiquidity and/or problems in debt
management. Turning to other indicators, many older women reported having unpaid medical
bills, and having engaged in high-cost borrowing using alternative financial services, such as
rent-to-own stores, pawn shops, payday loans, auto title loans, and tax refund loans.
Table 5 here
The NFCS also included a set of questions to assess respondents’ levels of financial
literacy. Five questions were asked to test fundamental concepts regarding numeracy and the
capacity to do calculations related to interest rates, knowledge of inflation, risk diversification,
understanding of interest payments on a mortgage, and understanding of basic asset pricing
(Lusardi, 2011). Table 6 reports the proportion of correct and incorrect answers and the “do not
know” responses to each of these questions. Overall, we find that financial literacy is rather low.
A large fraction of women does not know simple financial concepts, and many indicate that they
do not know the answer to the questions. The proportion of “do not know” responses was
particularly high on the risk diversification question; as many as 52% of women age 51–56 and
51% of women age 57–61 indicated that they did not know whether a single company stock is
riskier than a stock mutual fund. There is also a high proportion of “do not know” responses for

17

the question on asset pricing. These two questions will help us differentiate among different
degrees of financial literacy among older women.
Table 6 here
Multivariate Regression Analysis
Next we present multivariate linear probability analyses of indicators of financial
planning, debt, and financial fragility. For the first dependent variable, we use the NFCS
question about whether respondents ever tried to figure out how much they need to save for
retirement. This is an important question in light of prior research showing that planners
accumulate far more retirement wealth than non-planners (Lusardi, 1999; Lusardi and Beeler,
2007; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a, b; 2011a, b). In addition to the regressors used in the HRS
analysis, namely age and ethnicity, we also control for marital status, education, income (using
dummies), and number of children. In addition, the richness of the NFCS allows us to control for
whether respondents experienced a large and unexpected drop in income the previous year, and
also the respondent’s level of financial literacy (defined as the number of correct answers to the
five financial literacy questions). Results are reported in the first column of Table 7.
Table 7 here
Both Panels A and B in Table 7 confirm that higher education and income are strongly
positively correlated with women having tried to figure out how much to save for retirement
among both age groups. Their number of dependent children is negatively associated with the
probability of having tried to plan for women age 51–56 but not for the older group, suggesting
some potential for a ‘catch-up’ after children leave home. Interestingly, financial literacy is also
an important determinant of financial planning: being able to answer one additional financial
literacy question correctly is associated with a 4–6 percentage point higher probability of

18

figuring out how much to put aside for retirement. This is a reasonably large result, in view of
the fact that only 39–45% of the respondents indicated they had tried to plan for retirement
(Table 4). This finding is consistent with data from the 2009 wave of the NFCS (Lusardi and
Mitchell, 2011b) where we use a very similar empirical specification, but we use all respondents
and all age groups, and other surveys as well that use different measures of planning (Lusardi
and Mitchell, 2014). This finding is also consistent with data from a special module we designed
for the HRS on retirement planning and financial literacy; in that work we showed that financial
literacy is an important predictor of retirement planning for older women as well (Lusardi and
Mitchell, 2008).
Next we turn to respondents’ answers to the NFCS question about their degree of
agreement with the statement: “I have too much debt right now.” We use this variable to proxy
for peoples’ concerns about their debt, since debt levels (as reported in the HRS) are not
available in the NFCS. Results are reported in column (2) of Table 7 for both age groups (Panels
A and B).
Once again, we find that women who report having too much debt are also those with
more dependent children, with the effect among the older age group almost three times as large
as for those age 51–56. Shocks also matter: those having had a large unexpected income drop in
the prior year were 68–78 percentage points more likely to state that they were over-indebted.
Those with higher income (income greater than $100,000 for women age 51–56 and income
greater than $150,000 for women age 57–61) are less likely to have too much debt. And once
again, the more financially literate were less likely to report they had excessive debt (answering
one more financial literacy question decreases the probability of “too much debt” by 8–10
percentage points), confirming findings in other surveys and other age groups (Lusardi and

19

Tufano, 2015). In other words, shocks do contribute to debt concerns for women on the verge of
retirement, but people who have the capacity to manage their resources are more likely to stay
out of debt as they head into retirement.
The financial fragility measure available in the NFCS is a proxy for low savings. While
the HRS reports whether women have less than $25,000 in savings, the NFCS asks if they could
come up with $2,000 within a month (multiplying that figure by 12 would bring $24,000).
Findings in column (3) of Table 7 show that, for both age groups, having more dependent
children and having experienced an income shock are positively and significantly associated with
the probability of being financially fragile. Those with higher income are less likely to be
financially fragile. Moreover, those who are more financially literate have a lower probability of
being financially fragile.

Conclusions
Our goal in this paper has been to ascertain whether older women’s current and
anticipated future labor force patterns have changed over time, and if so, to evaluate the factors
associated with longer work lives and plans to continue work at older ages. We have also sought
to evaluate debt and debt management as a factor spurring older women’s continued work.
The analysis has yielded several findings. First, we show that each cohort of older women
worked more currently, and intended to work more in the future, than our HRS baseline surveyed
in 1992. The mean probability of being at work for the baseline HRS sample (age 51–56 when
surveyed) was 64.9 percent, and 54.8 percent for those age 57–61. All subsequent cohorts
displayed higher rates of work, particularly the age 51–56 cohort. For instance, younger WB
women age 51–56 had about a 7 percentage point greater labor force attachment, or around 11%

20

higher, than the HRS reference cohort. Early Boomer women age 51–56 were 5.3–5.7 percentage
points more attached to the labor force, or 8% more than the HRS, while the older (age 57–61)
Early Boomers had participation rates of 4.7–6.2 percentage points higher, or 8–11% more than
the HRS reference group. The younger Mid-Boomers also were working more than the reference
group, with 3.8–4.5 percentage point greater employment rates, or 6–7% versus the HRS
reference cohort.
Second, when we compare differences in older women’s self-reported expected chances
of working at older ages, again we find evidence that more recent cohorts of older women
anticipate working longer. For the baseline HRS cohort, 22.5% of the younger age group and
23.4 of the older age group intended to still work at age 65. By contrast, both the Early and
Middle Baby Boomer cohorts were significantly more likely to say they intended to work at age
65. Early Boomers believed they had a 4–5 percentage point higher chance of working than the
HRS cohort (on a base of about 26%), and the Middle Boomers were even more likely to be
working for pay at age 65 compared to the HRS reference group. These patterns confirm that
continued work and delayed retirement is becoming more prevalent for older women over time.
Third, when we explored the explanations for delayed retirement among older women,
significant factors included education, marital disruption, health, and fewer children than prior
cohorts. Yet household finances also appeared to be playing a key role, in that older women
today have more debt than previously, and they are more financially fragile than in the past. As
an example, we showed that a standard deviation increase in the ratio of mortgage debt to home
value was associated with a 3.4–5.5% rise in women’s anticipated probability of working at age
65. In large part this can be attributed to having taken on larger residential mortgages due to the
run-up in housing prices over time and decline in required down payments.

21

Our results using the NFCS are compatible with the HRS results, but the richer set of
questions asked in the NFCS add additional dimensions to the results. For instance we found that
women who were more financially literate were more likely to plan for retirement, were less
likely to have excessive debt, and were less likely to be financially fragile. Having more children
and unexpected, large income shocks also played an important role. Overall, these findings speak
to the important role of managing finances later in life, including debt.
Our work to date has been mainly descriptive rather than causal, but we are well aware
that planning, saving, and retirement decisions are all made in a life-cycle context. Accordingly
our future research will explore ways to identify how financial literacy, planning, and debt
management can help drive decision making at older ages which can be conducive to retirement
security.

Note: The sample includes all age-eligible women age 51–56 and 57–61 in the 2012 NFCS. Financial
literacy refers to the number of correct answers to 5 financial literacy questions. Income shock refers to a
dummy variable for those who experience a large drop in income in the previous 12 months that they did
not expect. Financial planning is coded as 1 for those who tried to figure out how much they need to save
for retirement. Having too much debt refers to respondents who chose values 5, 6, or 7 (on a scale from 1
to 7) when asked to evaluate if they have too much debt. Financial fragility is coded as 1 for those who
probably or certainly could not come up with $2,000 within the next month. All statistics are weighted
using survey weights.

Note: The sample includes all age-eligible women age 51–56 and 57–61 in the 2012 NFCS. Making ends
meet refers to the ability to balance monthly income and expenses. Statistics related to underwater with
home value and credit card fees are conditional on holding the asset or debt. Statistics related to loan on
retirement accounts and hardship withdrawal from retirement accounts are conditional to having a
retirement account. High-cost methods of borrowing refer to auto title loans, payday loans, pawn shops,
rent-to-own stores, and tax refund loans. All statistics are weighted using survey weights.

Note: Coefficient estimates from analysis reported in the text, standard errors in parentheses. Retirement planning coded as 1 for those who tried to figure out how much
they need to save for retirement. Having too much debt ranges from 1 to 7, where 1 means I strongly disagree and 7 I strongly agree with the statement “I have too
much debt right now.” Financial fragility coded as 1 for those certain or probably could not come up with $2,000. Explanatory variables include age, race/ethnicity,
marital status, number of financially dependent children, education, income, having experienced an income shock, and an indicator of financial literacy. Baseline
categories: White, married, less than high school education, and income lower than $15,000. Weighted data. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
