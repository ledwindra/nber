Understanding Social Interactions: Evidence from the Classroom

NBER Working Paper No. 19202

JEL No. I21,J0
ABSTRACT
Little is known about the economic mechanisms leading to the high level of clustering in behavior
commonly observed in the data. We present a model where agents can interact according to three distinct
mechanisms, and we derive testable implications which allow us to distinguish between the proposed
mechanisms. In our application we study students’ performance and we find that a mutual insurance
mechanism is consistent with the data. Such a result bears important policy implications for all those
situations in which social interactions are important, from teamwork to class formation in education
and co-authorship in academic research.

Introduction

There is a firm belief that social interactions are important determinants of behavior in a variety of
contexts (Matthew O. Jackson 2008, Matthew O. Jackson 2009), yet very little is known about the
mechanics of such interactions. We propose and test models of social interactions where risk-averse
agents engage in production and can either (i) act in isolation, (ii) exploit possible complementarities
(joint production), or (iii) mutually insure against idiosyncratic shocks to time or productivity.
These models lend testable predictions in the first and second moments of the distribution of outcomes that allow us to distinguish them in empirical applications. In particular, while all three mechanisms generate outcomes that are correlated within groups, they bear different implications for the
average performance of group members.
We consider the model in which agents act in isolation, but may care about each others’ performance,
as a benchmark and we compare the implications of joint production and insurance against it. We show
that under joint production agents exploit complementarities to achieve a higher level of output compared
to the benchmark. In the mutual (full) insurance scenario, any idiosyncratic shock to productivity (or
endowments) across agents is eliminated and the within-group comparisons that induced higher effort
in the benchmark case disappear. As a consequence average output is lower in mutual insurance than in
the benchmark case.
Despite the fact that our three mechanisms generate different predictions for average performance,
they all lead to clustering of outcomes within groups, which is what is commonly referred to as peer
effects or social interactions. Under decentralization (i.e. our benchmark model) such a result rests on
the assumption that agents evaluate their performance relative to their peers, as in a tournament or status
seeking model (Sherwin Rosen 1986, George A. Akerlof 1997). Namely, the utility one enjoys out of a
good performance declines if everyone in the group does well. A recent paper by David Card, Alexandre Mas, Enrico Moretti & Emmanuel Saez (2012) provides convincing evidence that relative utility is
important to workers as they learn about their co-workers’ compensations. When agents produce jointly,
the effort levels of all members of the group enter each other’s production functions, thus inducing correlation in outcomes. Finally, in the mutual insurance setting the heterogeneity due to the idiosyncratic
shocks is eliminated, thus mechanically reducing the dispersion of outcomes within groups.
In our model agents choose their optimal level of effort conditional on the idiosyncratic shock, while
the choice of the interaction mechanism is made beforehand under uncertainty according to a standard
von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility function. We further assume that there are costs associated
to active social interactions, such as those required to produce jointly or to engage in mutual insurance,
and that such costs decrease as agents get to know each other. Consistently with this framework, in
our empirical application we examine how the mean and the dispersion of outcomes evolve with the
frequency of students’ meetings in the classroom.
We test the implications of our model using data on undergraduate students at Bocconi University,
who are randomly assigned to teaching classes. Moreover, the random allocation is repeated at the
beginning of each academic year, so that the data exhibit a large degree of exogenous variation (both
cross-sectionally and over time) in the number of hours any two students spend together in the same
classroom. We exploit such exogenous variation to test the implications of the interaction mechanisms
2

considered in our theoretical discussion on the mean and the variance of academic performance, both
cross-sectionally and over time.
Our results indicate that mutual insurance is the economic mechanism that prevails in the setting
of our application. Specifically, we find that pairs of students who are more often allocated to the
same classes are characterized by less dispersed outcomes and lower average performance (both crosssectionally and over time). Of the three mechanisms considered, insurance is the only one capable of
producing both of these results. As an additional test of insurance, we also find that the likelihood that
the grade vectors of any two students cross decreases with the number of hours they have been randomly
allocated to the same classes. Such a result is consistent with the mutual insurance mechanism, which
preserves the ranking of agents’ outcomes across states and time.
In terms of magnitude, our results suggest that the mean grade of students who attend all their
compulsory courses together would be 12% of a standard deviation (0.2 grade points) lower that that of
students who attend each course with an entirely new group of peers.
To our knowledge, we are amongst the first to explicitly investigate the economic nature of social
interactions. The literature has been dominated by the search for suitable identification strategies to
solve the many econometric hurdles of peer effects models (Charles F. Manski 1993, William A. Brock
& Steven N. Durlauf 2001, Robert Moffitt 2001) and has, so far, devoted very little attention to understanding the different mechanisms that may generate such effects.1 One notable exception is Jane
Cooley (2009), who looks at a series of theoretical models to derive the empirical functional forms of
spill-overs across classmates. A different approach is taken by Alberto Bisin, Andrea Moro & Giorgio
Topa (2011), who discuss the identification of models of social interactions in the presence of multiple equilibria, although their analysis is carried out in a setting where the economic mechanism is not
directly investigated.
We test the implications of our models in the context of higher education but the set-up and the topics
discussed in this paper are quite general and can be applied to many other situations. For example, in a
production team the pressure exerted by the social group, either through sanctions or by simple relative
utility, may alleviate the free-riding problem (Eugene Kandel & Edward P. Lazear 1992, Armen Alchian
& Harold Desmetz 1972, Bengt Holmstrom 1982). Peer pressure also explains the results of Alexandre
Mas & Enrico Moretti (2009), where supermarket checkers’ performance improves when they are paired
with high performance colleagues. Similarly, peer pressure seems to provide a consistent explanation
also for the findings in Armin Falk & Andrea Ichino (2006).2
A key difference between our theoretical approach and the typical model of team production is the
verifiability of individual output by the principal. Consistently with the empirical application, in our
model individual performance is verifiable, there are no (explicit) principals nor informational asymmetries, however agents face an uncertain environment characterized by random shocks to their time
endowments or to their productivities. We believe that many production problems resemble the one
1

A recent wave of studies has approached the identification problem with the use of network structures (Yann Bramoullé,
Habiba Djebbari & Bernard Fortin 2009, Coralio Ballester, Antoni Calvó-Armengol & Yves Zenou 2006, Giacomo De Giorgi,
Michele Pellizzari & Silvia Redaelli 2010).

Oriana Bandiera, Iwan Barankay & Imran Rasul (2009a) show how social connections affect productivity in teams; while
Patrick Bayer, Randi Pintoff & David Pozen (2009) provide evidence on the underlying nature of the interaction in criminal
behavior, suggesting a mechanism based on information or learning from others.

studied in this paper, from manufacturing to construction, to most white collar jobs or coauthoring in
academic research, where tenure decisions are made at the individual level but the research activity is
often carried out within groups of co-authors.
Without knowledge of the mechanics of social interactions it is often impossible to foresee the
effects of policy interventions. A notable example is Scott Carrell, Bruce I. Sacerdote & James E.
West (2012), whose experiment on optimal sorting of students based on reduced form parameters leads
to unexpected and unintended results. In this view, the policy implications of our paper are far-reaching.
In our application, for example, if the aim of the policy maker is to maximize average performance, one
would design a mechanism of class allocation that prevents students from meeting too frequently and/or
introduces incentives to favor joint production and limits the possibility of mutual insurance.
Whenever production is organised in teams, knowing that agents may engage in mutual insurance
is important for the principal, who may design a process of team formation and rotation that maximises
the benefits of cooperation without encouraging insurance behaviours (Kandel & Lazear 1992, Bandiera,
Barankay & Rasul 2009a, Oriana Bandiera, Iwan Barankay & Imran Rasul 2012).
The interpretation of our findings in the light of a well-defined model of mutual insurance allows us
to draw implications for a number of other settings, thus reinforcing the external validity of our analysis.
However, viewed from the strict policy perspective of education institutions that are similar to Bocconi
university, our results bear important implications regardless of the exact nature of the interaction mechanism. Knowing that average performance may decrease when interactions are particularly frequent is
sufficient to suggest reallocating students to classes in a way that can prevent such a decline. At the
same time learning what’s the mechanisms can inform the school on the policy action to increase mean
and reduce variances both across students and overtime. The college can still decide to keep the current
allocation while also introducing productivity prizes and bonuses, that could ensure a low variances of
grades as well as revert the fall in the grades due to insurance. Importantly, if the school were to provide
standardized teaching material that would per se reduce the need for peers’ insurance, but the fall in
grades would still persist even if the number of meetings were to be dropped.
We admittedly propose and test a limited set of models and some of our results can certainly be
captured by alternative mechanisms.3 Our analysis more modestly shows that the patterns of observed
social interactions can be explained by a small set of simple economic mechanisms, that are relatively
standard and well-established in the literature.
In this sense, we depart significantly from most of the literature on peer effects and social interactions, that focuses on the identification and estimation of the linear-in-means model (Manski 1993).
As acknowledged by most authors, that model can be seen as the econometric counterpart of several
theoretical mechanisms of interactions and one reading of our contribution is precisely the attempt to
uncover such mechanism, within a small set of standard economic models.
The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents our three simple models of social interactions (decentralization, joint production and mutual insurance); in Section 3 we provide a description
of the data used in Section 4 to carry out the empirical exercise and take the predictions of the model to
the test. Section 5 briefly discusses alternative mechanisms and, finally, Section 6 concludes.

Model

In this section we present a simple model of social interactions. For expositional purposes and coherence
with the empirical application, we will frame the model in the education environment and characterize
the two agents as students and the production process as learning. Otherwise, the model can be applied to other settings and it is meant to parsimoniously include the key features of several interaction
mechanisms and to produce testable implications that can be taken to the data.
Two risk averse, ex-ante identical students (i, j) exert costly effort to study, learn and obtain a grade
in academic tests or exams. Students value high academic performance. For simplicity, we assume
that all tests are identical and we exclude the possibility that good performance in one exam affects
later performance.4 Students are hit by idiosyncratic shocks to their endowment of time or to their
productivity. Effort is chosen conditional on such shocks, an assumption that, combined with the lack
of interlinks across exams, implies that the choice of effort is completely static.
Additionally, agents are allowed to interact according to three different mechanisms: (i) decentralization (Section 2.1); (ii) joint production (Section 2.2); (iii) mutual (full) insurance (Section 2.3). The
choice of the mode of interaction is made before observing the realizations of the shocks on the basis of
a standard von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility function. We further assume that active interactions, either in the form of joint production or mutual insurance, are costly and that such costs decrease
with how well students know each other.5 The choice of the mode of interaction can be revised for each
exam, for example when the lectures begin.
Utility function. The utility of the generic student i depends positively on her academic performance xi and negatively on effort ei . Moreover, we assume two additional properties of the utility
function. First, students are risk averse, a property that generates the desire to insure against fluctuations in academic performance. Second, the individual returns to xi (might) decrease with one’s peer
performance xj . Alternative interpretations of this assumption are that students are averse to equality or
feel the peers’ pressure. We parameterize this relative utility effect with a loading factor γ ∈ (0, γ) that
multiplies xj in i’s utility and vice versa. Thanks to this assumption the model delivers within group
correlation of the outcomes, even in the decentralized equilibrium. Eventually, we will work with the
following static utility function:6
Ui = ln (xi − γxj ) − ei

(1)

Production/Learning function. Academic performance is the output of a learning/production process, whose inputs are effort (possibly of both agents) and time ti , combined according to the following
technology:
xi = ti g(ei , ej )
4

(2)

The model could easily accommodate interlinks across academic tests and the qualitative implications would remain
unchanged.
5
The term active interaction is merely used for expositional clarity and convenience and it should not be given any further
interpretation. In the context of this paper it simply refers to interactions that require some cost to be undertaken. The only
crucial distinctive feature of the interactions taking place in the decentralization setting is their being costless.
6
There is a corresponding and symmetric function for agent j. Obviously, γ is bounded above by γ to guarantee that
xi > γxj and xj > γxi . The choice of the particular (concave) utility function and the static framework are not crucial for
the testable implications produced.

5

While the level of effort is endogenously chosen by the student, time is an exogenous factor subject to
idiosyncratic shocks.7 In this interpretation, it is natural to assume that the two production factors are
complementary to some degree (not perfect substitutes).8 We assume:
∂g(ei , ej )
∂g(ei , ej )
> 0,
≥ 0 (production is non-decreasing in efforts);
∂ei
∂ej
∂ 2 g(ei , ej )
∂ 2 g(ei , ej )

0,
≤ 0 (production is non-convex in efforts);
∂ 2 ei
∂ 2 ej
∂ 2 g(ei , ej )
> 0, (positive cross-partial derivatives or complementarity of efforts);
∂ei ∂ej
∂g(ei , ej )
∂g(ei , ej )
>
, (marginal product of own effort larger than that of peer).
∂ei
∂ej

(6)

When students do not produce jointly, ej does not enter the production function for xi and for
notational convenience we label g(ei , 0) as f (ei ):
xi = ti g(ei , 0) = ti f (ei )

(7)

Shocks. Time is equal to a fixed (maximum) endowment normalized to 1 and we allow for a negative
shock of size  to arrive with probability
couple, so that with probability

and ti = 1 + ui . The shock hits only one person in the {i, j}

we have ui = 0 and uj = − and with probability

1
2

we have

ui = − and uj = 0. This is equivalent to assuming that the shocks to t are perfectly negatively
correlated between the two agents. This stochastic endowment process could be easily generalized and
the results would remain qualitatively unchanged as long as some degree of idiosyncratic variation is
maintained. The most intuitive interpretation of the shock is absence due to illness or random distraction
in the classroom. Although one could alternatively interpret t as some simple (stochastic) productivity
parameter, we find our previous interpretation more convenient for expositional purposes.

2.1

Decentralized solution

When students act in isolation they maximize their utility taking each other’s behavior as given, as in a
simultaneous move game. Even in this simple version, our model still has the potential to generate peer
effects through relative utility (or equality aversion).
Without loss of generality, we will assume throughout the paper that agent i has a positive shock
(ti = 1) and j has a negative one (tj = 1 − ):
Ui = ln [f (ei ) − γ(1 − )f (ej )] − ei

(8)

= ln [(1 − )f (ej ) − γf (ei )] − ej

The production function of human capital might clearly include other inputs, such as teachers, resources, class size and
class composition, to name just a few. However, to keep the model simple and coherent with the empirical application, we
focus solely on effort and time. Adding additional inputs that are controlled by the education institution would only complicate
the notation, while in the empirical analysis we can fully control for all these additional factors.
8
We could also work with a more complicated function g(ei , ti , ej , tj ), but the derivation becomes more tedious without
any real additional insight. This is due to the fact that ti and tj are exogenous factors.

Equilibrium effort levels (under decentralization) - eD

∂f (eD

(10)
(11)

Notice that equations 10 and 11 characterize a Nash equilibrium where agents move simultaneously.
Concavity in the utility function leads to the following results:
Proposition 1 (a) The equilibrium effort level is not smaller for the student affected by the negative
D
shock: eD
i ≤ ej , with equality holding when the other student outcome does not not appear in the

utility function, i.e. the loading parameter (γ) equals 0. (b) The performance/grade of the student hit by
D
a positive shock is larger than that obtained by the student with a negative shock, i.e. xD
i > xj , where
D
xD
i and xj are the equilibrium outcomes for agent i and j respectively.

The proofs can be found in Appendix A.
Further, we can show that:
Proposition 2 (a) The equilibrium levels of effort of both student i and j are increasing in γ:
and

γ ∈ [0, γ̄). (c) Under the regularity conditions set out in Appendix A, the dispersion in performances is
non-increasing in γ, i.e.

∂CV (xD )
∂γ

≤ 0 for any admissible γ ∈ [0, γ̄).

Proposition 2 implies that, as the strength of the externalities in academic performance (measured
by γ) increases, so does the mean outcome of the group E(x) = 21 (xi + xj ) since everyone exerts higher
effort.
Understanding the implications of relative utility on the dispersion of the equilibrium outcomes
is slightly more complicated. We start using equations 10 and 11 to derive the following convenient
expression for the coefficient of variation of the outcomes, our measure of dispersion:
CV (x) =

xi − xj
SD(x)

E(x)

→ 0. Thus, the more students care about their relative performance the lower the dispersion

in the outcomes. Intuitively, this result is generated by the concavity of the utility function by which
student j, who is hit by the negative shock, is placed on a steeper segment of the utility function and,
thus, cares more about performance. In fact, under some additional assumptions about the production
function f (·), this result generalizes to the entire range of feasible values of γ. In Appendix A we
describe such additional assumptions in detail.9

Proposition 2 shows that our simple model produces what are commonly termed peer effects also
in the decentralized equilibrium, simply by virtue of relative utility. We will maintain this case as the
baseline scenario.

2.2

Joint production

In this section we modify the model under the assumption that students work together in the production
process.10 This could also be interpreted as a model of co-authorship, where each agent individually
goes up for tenure or, alternatively, as a model of teamwork where individual performance is verifiable,
effort is observed and the agents contribute to each other’s output (Alchian & Desmetz 1972, Holmstrom
1982, Kandel & Lazear 1992).
More formally, the model in this section characterizes the Nash equilibrium of a simultaneous move
game in which agents choose effort to maximise the utility function in equation 1 and the production
technology is defined in equation 2.
Combining the definition of the production function in equation 2 and the structure of the shocks,
we can define the following utility functions for agent i and agent j:
Ui = ln [g(ei , ej ) − γ(1 − )g(ej , ei )] − ei

(13)

= ln [(1 − )g(ej , ei ) − γg(ei , ej )] − ej

(14)

Uj

Like in the decentralization case, equilibrium effort is determined after observing the shocks according to the following first order conditions for the maximization of equations 13 and 14:
C
∂g(eC
i , ej )
C
C C

C
where eC
i is the equilibrium effort of agent i under joint production and similarly for ej .

Using equations 15 and 16, it is relatively easy to derive the following proposition, where eD
i and
eD
j are the equilibrium effort levels under decentralization:
Proposition 3 (a) The level of effort under joint production is larger than in the decentralized case for
D
both students, i.e. eC
a > ea for any a = {i, j}. (b) Average performance
i

is larger than in decentralization: E(xC ) > E(xD ), where xC = g(eC
i , ej ), (1 − )g(ej , ei ) and
h
i
D
xD = f (eD
i ), (1 − )f (ej ) are the equilibrium outcomes under joint production and decentraliza-

tion, respectively.
The proof, in Appendix A, is trivial given that the level of effort is larger under joint production than
decentralization for both students, a result that rests exclusively on the existence of complementarities
in the production function (i.e.

∂ 2 g(ei ,ej )
∂ei ∂ej

> 0).

10

The term cooperation might also suggest a situation where agents maximize the sum of each other’s utilities. This is not
how we solve the model in this section, although in the On-line Appendix we consider precisely that type of equilibrium as the
planner’s solution.

8

Another interesting result of this model is described in the next proposition:
Proposition 4 The difference of the performances is smaller under joint production than decentralC
D
D
ization, i.e. (xC
i − xj ) < (xi − xj ), hence, given Proposition 3.a and 3.b, both the standard de-

viation and the coefficient of variation are smaller under joint production than decentralization, i.e.
SD(xC ) < SD(xD ) and CV (xC ) < CV (xD ).
The formal proof is in Appendix A but the intuition of the result in proposition 4 is straightforward:
the concavity in the utility function implies that the agent hit by the negative shock (j) enjoys higher
marginal utility from improved outcomes, hence, given the complementarity in the production function,
she increases effort (relative to the decentralized equilibrium) more than her peer.
In sum, this section shows that, under joint production, students’ outcomes are higher on average
and less dispersed than under decentralization.

2.3

Insurance

The third and last mechanism of interaction that we consider is mutual insurance against idiosyncratic
shocks to time or productivity, e.g. health shocks or random distractions (John H. Cochrane 1991,
Barbara J. Mace 1991, Robert M. Townsend 1994). Under such circumstances the student would find
herself in need of help to fill the gap of important teaching material. Given risk aversion, students
have a desire to insure against such fluctuations in their time endowments (or their productivities) by
exchanging notes or explanations of class material with classmates. We model such an exchange as a
transfer of time or productivity t between agents.
As already mentioned, we choose an extremely simple structure of the shocks but the implications
of the model are robust to alternative assumptions. As long as there is some idiosyncratic variation in t,
the main results are unchanged.
For simplicity, we consider only the case of full insurance, where the students are perfectly able to
smooth away the shocks to their time endowments. Moreover, given that our agents are ex-ante identical, we set identical Pareto weights. For the moment, we also abstract from any issue of commitment
(Stephen Coate & Martin Ravallion 1993, Narayana R. Kocherlakota 1996, Fernando Alvarez & Urban J. Jermann 2000, Ethan Ligon, Jonathan P. Thomas & Tim Worrall 2000) but we will come back to
this later in section 2.4.
Under these assumptions, agents in our model choose their effort levels exclusively on the basis of
the aggregate time endowment in the group. Hence, students solve the optimization problem by simply
splitting equally the difference in their endowments. Moreover, since in our model the agents are ex-ante
identical, the equilibrium level of effort is the same for both of them: eIi = eIj = eI . Contrary to the
previous cases (decentralization and joint production), in this particular setting it does not matter whether
effort is determined before or after observing the shocks, apart from commitment issues. Formally,
Ui = Uj = U = ln [tf (e) − γtf (e)] − e

t = (1 − )

(17)
(18)

The corresponding first order condition is:

and equilibrium performance is:

∂f (eI )
= f (eI )
∂eI

(19)


xI = (1 − )f (eI ).
2

(20)

Notice that γ, the parameter that measures reference utility considerations, does not appear in these first
order conditions. This is due to the fact that under (full) insurance agents are identical both ex-ante and
ex-post so that comparisons become meaningless. This has important implications on equilibrium effort,
which is necessarily lower under mutual insurance than under decentralization (and, consequently, also
compared to joint production) due to the fact that the within-group comparisons that induced higher
effort in the benchmark case have now disappeared.
It is also trivial to see that, in this model, the ratio of marginal utilities

∂Ui
∂ei

=

∂Uj
∂ej

is equal to 1.

This is a consequence of full insurance, as the ratio of the marginal utilities depends only on the Pareto
weights, which, in our simple model, are identical for both agents. As such, given standard assumptions
on the utility function, the ratio of the levels of performance

xIi
xIj

is constant across states (and time).

This observation has a direct testable prediction: the vectors of performance outcomes of any two
agents who engage in mutual full insurance should never cross, given that individual performance depends exclusively on the aggregate time endowment and the relative importance of the student in the
group (the Pareto weights).11 In Section 4, we take also this prediction to the empirical test.
We can, then, prove the following, where eI is the equilibrium effort level, common to both agents,
under full insurance:

11

Such prediction would be however incorrect if the agents had heterogenous risk preferences (Sam Schulloffer-Wohl 2008,
Maurizio Mazzocco & Shiv Saini 2012).

10

Proposition 5 (a) The levels of effort and performance are lowest in the full insurance scenario for both
C
C
D
I
students, i.e. eIa < eD
a < ea for any a = {i, j}, which immediately implies E(x ) > E(x ) > E(x ).

(b) Performances dispersion is lowest under full insurance, i.e. CV (xI ) < CV (xC ) < CV (xD ).
The proof is fairly straightforward and can, once again, be found in Appendix A. The intuition is that,
under full insurance, effort is lower due to the lack of within-group heterogeneity that, with a reference
based utility, generates the desire to excel. The result on dispersion is the combined outcome of the
reduced impact of the idiosyncratic shocks, mechanically generated by the insurance process, and the
equalization of efforts among the agents. As we show in Appendix A, the variance is reduced at a faster
rate than the mean performance, indeed in our simplified model with ex-ante homogeneous agents the
(cross-sectional) variance of performance is equal to zero.

Transition or the choice of the mechanism

In this section we discuss the choice of the mode of interaction as a possible mechanism of transition
between the benchmark scenario of decentralization and the two proposed models of joint production
and insurance. The mechanics of the transition will form the basis of our empirical exercise, as we will
relate the equilibria defined in the previous sections to an underlying exogenous variation in the time
students spend together. We expect students not to interact actively when they only met a few times
and, as they spend more and more time together, they may start engaging in joint production or mutual
insurance (or both).
The choice of the interaction modes between two students is based on a standard expected utility
function defined over the two possible realizations of the shocks. Notice that, since agents are ex-ante
identical, they both share the same expected utility and the resulting choice of the mechanism will be
unanimous.
We also assume that active social interactions, such as those required to produce jointly or to engage
in mutual insurance, impose some utility cost and that such costs decrease with how well agents know
each other. First, consider joint production and assume that the ability to produce jointly depends on
how well the students know each other, which is a positive function of the time they spend together. We
model this as a (utility) cost of the following form c(m) ≥ 0, where m is the number of times agents
meet randomly and with

∂c(m)
∂m

< 0. This cost function incorporates the idea that agents must pay some

initial cost for getting to know each other. At some point the number of previous meetings is large
enough to make the cost of cooperating lower than its benefits and students would, then, transit from the
baseline scenario of complete decentralization to the joint production state.
A similar argument applies to insurance, as it takes time to get to know someone to the point that
reciprocal monitoring and trust are sufficient to engage in mutual insurance. More formally, we describe
the cost of insurance with a function h(m), with

∂h(m)
∂m

< 0. The function h(m) could also be interpreted

as a punishment or sanction function that describes the utility loss derived from deviating from the
insurance scheme (Coate & Ravallion 1993). Under such interpretation, the size of the punishment
increases with the number of meetings, somehow capturing the idea that defaulting on someone we
know better is more painful or more difficult.

11

Given that our agents are risk averse, they will have an incentive to renege on the insurance contract
in the good state (t = 1) and, as such, the contract will have to be self enforcing or incentive compatible
(Coate & Ravallion 1993, Ligon, Thomas & Worrall 2000). However, given the static nature of this
simplified model, the only equilibrium would be to renege if the sanction is low. As students meet more
often, they either find it harder to default on good friends or they develop the ability to punish deviating
behaviors more effectively, so that, even under limited commitment, the full insurance allocation can be
implemented for a sufficiently high level of m.
Consistently with our empirical application, where students initially do not know each other and
are randomly allocated to teaching classes, we assume that decentralization requires no costs and is the
baseline scenario.
Students select the mechanism that is associated with the highest level of expected utility as follows:

E(U j ) = 1{j = D}

(21)

Where 1{.} is the indicator function, U (eD
u=0 ) is the utility computed at the equilibrium effort level
in decentralization under the good realization of the shock and similarly for the other expressions, with
superscripts indicating the interaction mode and subscripts the values of the shock. Recall than in the
mutual insurance model equilibrium effort is independent of the shock.
Agents choose the mode of interaction J in order to maximize equation 21. When m is sufficiently
low, possibly zero, the costs associated with joint production or mutual insurance are larger than the benefits and students simply act in isolation according to our benchmark model of decentralized behavior.
As m increases, both c(m) and h(m) decrease until, for a sufficiently high m, either joint production or
mutual insurance become the utility-maximizing mode of interaction.
The relative shape of the functions c(m) and h(m) defines which of the models, joint production or
insurance, arises first. In fact, although we do not model this situation explicitly, it might very well be
possible that, for some values of m, both joint production and mutual insurance coexist. Moreover, while
it is obvious that in the absence of costs both joint production and mutual insurance would be preferred
to decentralization, preferences over these last two mechanisms depend on the functional forms as well
as on the size of the shock.12
Ultimately, the type of mechanism at work is an empirical matter and our analysis in Section 4
exploits the following testable implications to shed light on this precise issue:
If
If

∂CV (x)
<0
∂m
∂CV (x)
<0
∂m

and
and

∂E(x)
> 0 ⇒ Joint production is the prevailing mechanism;
∂m
∂E(x)
< 0 ⇒ Insurance is the prevailing mechanism.
∂m

12

Joint production offers the advantage of exploiting the complementarities in the production function, hence in the absence
of costs it would be preferred to decentralization. Similarly, mutual insurance reduces the variance of the outcomes and, given
the concavity of the utility function, it dominates decentralization when h(m) = 0.

12

The reduction in the (within-group) dispersion of performances as a function of the time spent together
indicates the existence of peer effects, while the relation between the number of meetings and average
performance in the group allows us to distinguish between joint production and insurance.
Notice additionally that these empirical implication have been derived under the assumption that
the intensity of interactions m only affects the costs of engaging in joint production or insurance. In
particular, we do not allow m to affect the form of the utility function and namely the degree to which
agents care about each other’s performance (γ). We return to this point in Section 5.
The model in this section rests on a number of simplifying assumptions, many of which can be
relaxed without affecting the main implications. In particular, in the On-line Appendix we extend the
model to a setting with multiple agents and we derive the social planner solution.

The data

In this section we describe the data we use in Section 4 to test the theoretical predictions of our models.
The data come from the administrative archives of Bocconi University, an institution of higher education
located in Milan, Italy (De Giorgi, Pellizzari & Redaelli 2010, Giacomo De Giorgi, Michele Pellizzari
& William Gui Woolston 2012). The important feature of these data for the purpose of our application
is that students are (repeatedly) randomly assigned to teaching classes for each of their compulsory
courses.
More specifically, we will focus on two cohorts of students who first enrolled at Bocconi in the academic year 1999/00 and 2000/01.13 These students were offered 7 degree programs (majors), however,
only 3 of them were large enough to require the splitting of lectures into more than one class: Economics, Management, Economics and Finance.14 The official duration of all programs was 4 years and,
during the first two years, and for most of the third, all students were required to take a fixed sequence of
compulsory courses. Afterwards students could choose elective subjects, within some program-specific
rules. In order to avoid issues of endogenous selection, we exclude all elective courses from our analysis
ad we focus exclusively on compulsory courses.
The compulsory curricula is summarized in Table 1, while more details are given in the On-line Appendix. The table reports the number of compulsory courses (columns 1, 3 and 5) and the total number
of lecturing hours (columns 2, 4 and 6) for each degree program and academic year. For example, Table
1 shows that students in Management take 8 compulsory courses during their first year for a total of 464
hours of lectures.
[TABLE 1]
The crucial institutional feature for our testing strategy is the completely random procedure adopted
13

Although we have access to records for all students enrolled since 1989 and until 2009, we cannot choose a cohort that is
too recent because some of the students might still be working towards the completion of their degrees. For the earlier cohorts
we do not have information on the class identifiers, which are essential for our analysis. Moreover, Bocconi reformed the
structure of its programs twice during the period covered by these data, first in 1999/00 and then 2001/02. Hence, to avoid
comparing cohorts across different systems, we consider only students enrolled in their first year in 1999/00 and 2000/01.
14
The other programs were Economics and Management of the Public Administration, Economics and Law, Law, Economics
and Management in Arts, Culture and Communication.

13

to allocate students to teaching classes.15 The randomization was repeated at the beginning of each
academic year, when each student was informed of her class identifier and was instructed to take all the
lectures of the year in the class corresponding to her assigned identifier. Namely, students would take all
the courses of the first year with the same random group of peers, then all the courses of the second year
with a different random group and so on. Elective courses, which we do not consider in our analysis,
were usually much smaller in size and could easily be taught in a single class.
The figures reported in Table 1 clearly show that students who were assigned to the same class ended
up physically sitting in the same classroom for a considerable amount of time, thus suggesting that the
random allocation process is an important determinant of the strength of students’ interactions.
Students were allocated into several classes for the explicit purpose of maintaining adequate class
sizes and to allow teachers to interact with the students in a more direct way. The yearly repetition of
the random allocation was, instead, justified with the desire to encourage interactions among students.
Bocconi has followed attentively the rule of randomly allocating students to teaching classes so as to
avoid clustering of students in some classes. Moreover, for organizational reasons, students allocated
to a specific class were also taking most or all of their courses in exactly the same classroom. Overall,
there are 12 classes per academic year (and cohort): 8 classes in Management, 2 in Economics and 2 in
Economics&Finance. The classes are approximately equal sized, although not exactly.16
[TABLE 2]
Table 2 reports some descriptive statistics on the 2,406 students that we eventually consider in our
empirical exercise, broken down by degree program. The large majority of students are enrolled in the
Management program, which attracts over 70% of them. The Economics program is chosen by about
10% of the students and the remaining 20% are in Economics&Finance. There is a higher incidence
of males (58.5%) than females (41.5%) in the student body, with gender differences being more pronounced in the Economics and Economics&Finance programs. The majority (68%) of students come
from outside the province of Milan, the site of Bocconi. We also have information on the students’
household income, which is recorded in 4 brackets at the time of enrollment for the purpose of determining tuition fees and eligibility for scholarships. About 22% of the students are in the highest
of those brackets (approximately above 140 thousands USD). Average admission test scores and high
school grades, normalized on a scale 0-100, suggest that the best students cluster in Economics and
Economics&Finance.
[FIGURE 1]
In Figure 1 we present evidence consistent with random allocation, as in De Giorgi, Pellizzari &
Woolston (2012) and De Giorgi, Pellizzari & Redaelli (2010). The figure compares the distribution of

The terms class and lecture often have different meanings in different countries and sometimes also in different schools
within the same country. In most British universities, for example, lecture indicates a teaching session where an instructor typically a full faculty member - presents the main material of the course. Classes are instead practical sessions where a teacher
assistant solves problem sets and applied exercises with the students. At Bocconi there was no such distinction, meaning that
the same randomly allocated groups were kept for both regular lectures and applied classes. Hence, in the remainder of the
paper we use the two terms interchangeably.

As discussed in De Giorgi, Pellizzari & Woolston (2012), variation in class size is generated by logistic constraints, i.e.
variation in the physical size of available classrooms.

some selected characteristics in the entire cohort and within the groups of peers of a randomly selected
student in each of the three initial academic years. Specifically, the variables that we consider for the
tests in Figure 1 are the entry test score (upper left graph), high school grade (upper right graph), the
gender indicator (lower left graph), the indicator for high income (lower middle graph) and the dummy
for residence outside Milan (lower right graph). As it is evident from the figure, the distributions all look
very similar. Statistical tests also confirm such a visual impression. In the On-line Appendix we also
report Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for the comparison of the distributions of the admission test scores in
any possible pair of classes and any possible academic year and results show that we reject the null of
equality of the distributions, at the 10% level, in fewer than 10% of the comparisons (11 out of 180),
which is what one should expect under random assignment. We have produced similar tests also for the
distribution of high school grades as well as all the other characteristics considered in Figure 1, using
tests of proportions for those characteristics that take the form of simple dummy indicators (gender, high
income students and residence outside Milan). Results are not reported for brevity but are available from
the authors upon request.
In the empirical analysis of Section 4, we consider all possible pairs of students and compare mean
grades and coefficients of variation (as a measure of dispersion of outcomes within the pair), both across
pairs who are randomly allocated to the same classes more or less often and for the same pair over
academic years.
In principle, we could conduct the same analysis at the level of the individual student by defining
individual-specific peer groups identified by students who were randomly allocated to one’s same class
in any given academic year and/or in the past.17 There are both practical and theoretical reasons why
we prefer the pairwise specification to this alternative approach. First, the focus on student pairs allows
us to directly compare our results with the implications of the model, that is also presented in a twoagents setting. Second, there is no obvious definition of the appropriate measure of meeting times at
the level of the group. One could compute the number of times all students in the group have been
simultaneously allocated to the same class, an event that is relatively rare given the large size of most
classes. Alternatively, one could consider the mean of the pairwise meetings, but this approach would
merely aggregate information that can be more effectively used in the pairwise setting. Ideally, the
choice should be guided by some presumption about the level at which interactions take place, either
one-to-one or within groups. In the absence of direct information on this issue, the pairwise approach
provides the most stringent test of the implications of our theoretical model. In fact, while the studentlevel analysis may easily miss out on interactions that take place one-to-one, the opposite is true only
under relatively strong assumptions about the form of interactions, such as the case in which interactions
exclusively take place in groups. The On-line Appendix further discusses how our pairwise approach
can be reconciled also within a model of multiple agents interacting in groups.
Practically, we construct all pairs of students who could possibly meet, i.e. all pairs of students
who are in the same degree program and enrollment cohort. Eventually, we construct a dataset of over
800,000 pairs, whose descriptive statistics are reported in Table 3. It is important to clarify that the data
used for the empirical analysis contain one observation per pair per period, so that if the pair i, j appears
17

In fact, in a previous version of the paper we did adopt this approach obtaining similar results to those reported here.

15

in the data the symmetric pair j, i does not. Specifically, since the random allocation is performed within
degree program and cohort, only students within degree program and cohort cells can be allocated to
the same class. Call Ncp the number of students in cohort c and degree program p, then the number of
non-symmetric pairs generated by those students is

Ncd (Ncd −1) 18
.
2

[TABLE 3]
All the descriptive statistics in Table 3 are consistent with the random allocation (within degree
programs and cohorts) and the descriptives of the student body from Table 2.19 The last row of Table 3
reports the mean value of a dummy indicator for whether the students in the pair are ever allocated to
the same class and it shows that slightly less that 40% of the pairs ever met. Given the size of the degree
programs and the number of random classes in each of them, this number varies considerably with a low
33% in Management and a much larger 87% in Economics and Economics&Finance.
The repeated randomization adopted by Bocconi generates as a byproduct the fact that some students
met more often than others, a crucial feature for our empirical exercise in Section 4. In Table 4 we
describe the main variables that arise from such a repeated randomization process together with our key
outcomes at the level of the student pairs.
[TABLE 4]
The first row of Table 4 reports the average number of courses any two students sit together by degree
program and academic year. It is important to emphasize that, since this is meant to be an indicator of
how many opportunities for interactions students have had, it is a cumulative variable, i.e. it measures
the number of courses together in the current and in the past years. This is the reason why the number of
courses together always increases from one year to the next.20 On average two random students would
have sat 1.2 courses together by the end of their first year, 2.3 by their second year and 3.5 by the third.
Notice that these averages combine pairs of students who never meet and others that meet repeatedly.
Given the number of classes and courses in the different majors the above statistics become larger in
Economics and in Economics&Finance, i.e. 10-11 courses by the third year.
Since each course is taught for a different number of hours, the number of times students in the
pair are randomly assigned to the same class defines the number of hours they end up sitting together
in the same classroom (in the current and in the previous years). The average students pair spends
approximately 70 hours together by the end of the first year, 135 by the second and over 200 by the third.
Given the variation in the number of courses and their duration in hours (see Table 1), these statistics vary
considerably across degree programs, with students in Economics and Economics&Finance enjoying a
lot more opportunities for interactions.
We also describe the evolution of both our main outcomes: the average and the dispersion of academic performance within groups and across academic years. Notice that our main explanatory variable
18

Table Web.3 in the On-line Appendix shows the number of students in each cd cell and the corresponding number of pairs.
The comparison of Table 2 and Table 3, in fact, can also be interpreted as a randomization test. One could derive most
of the statistics in Table 3 from those in Table 2, using the number of classes in each program and the size of each enrollment
cohort (in each degree program).
20
In the regression analysis of Section 4 this mechanical time effect is controlled for by a set of year and degree program
dummies, which we always include in the control set.
19

16

(i.e. hours together) varies only across academic years for the same pair of student, hence we consider
only one observation for each pair in each year. Consequently, we compute the average grade of the
pair over all the compulsory courses of each academic year. As a measure of dispersion we consider
the coefficient of variation.21 Table 4 shows the basic characteristics of these variables, broken down
by academic year and degree program. The average grade is similar across all programs and years and
fluctuates around a mean of approximately 26/30 (B+), with a coefficient of variation of about 0.1.22
The last row of Table 4 reports the means, by degree program and academic year, of the crossing
indicator that we use in Section 4 to test the crossing property (see Section 2.3). Such an indicator is
constructed by comparing the grade vectors of the two students in each pair in each academic year and
verifying whether such vectors cross (at any point). In other words, the crossing indicator is equal to
zero if one student consistently outperforms (or ties) the other in all the courses of the specific academic
year. Otherwise, the grade vectors cross and the indicator takes value 1. The probability of crossing, for
any two students, ranges between 80% and 88%, with the exception of the third year in the Economics
program where it is equal to 68%.
For completeness, in Table 5 we present the full extent of variation in our key independent variable,
i.e. number of meetings or hours together. Given the academic structure of the curricula, the variation
arises both between and within (over-time) programs. There are a number of sources of variation for
our independent variable, all arising from the repeated random allocation in different teaching classes:
variation across majors in a given year, as well as variation between pairs (cross-sectional and over time)
and within pairs overtime. In particular, in the Management major about 65% of the possible pairs never
meet, while those pairs who meet in the first and second year (1.4%) sit together for about 850 hours,
the few who meet every year (0.2%) end up spending over 1,300 hours together. Any two students in
Economics are quite likely to meet as there are only two classes. In fact only about 13% of the (potential)
pairs never meet, while those who meet in year 1 and 2 (12%) spend 880 hours in the same classroom,
those who always meet (12%) spend about 1,100 hours together. Consistently with the random allocation
mechanism and similar class sizes, the meeting probabilities in the Economics&Finance program are
very similar to those in Economics. One can also show that as a result of the random allocation in two
classes of similar sizes (Econ and Econ&Finance) the distribution of meetings, i.e. the leftmost column
in Table 5 should look pretty even and close to 12-13%, which indeed is what we find in the data, an
additional piece of evidence that is consistent with a successful random allocation.
[TABLE 5]
21

In computing both the mean grade and the coefficient of variation we weight courses by their length, assigning a higher
weight to longer courses, i.e. courses with more hours of lectures. For robustness, we have replicated all our results using
unweighted outcomes obtaining virtually identical estimates. The results are not reported for brevity but are available from the
authors upon request.
22
In Italy, university exams are graded on a scale 0 to 30, with pass equal to 18. Such a peculiar grading scale comes from
historical legacy: while in primary, middle and high school students were graded by one teacher per subject on a scale 0 to 10
(pass equal to 6), at university each exam was supposed to be evaluated by a commission of three professors, each grading on
the same 0-10 scale, the final mark being the sum of the three. Hence, 18 is pass and 30 is full marks. Apart from the scaling,
the actual grading at Bocconi is performed as in the average US or UK university.

Empirical Analysis

In this section we analyze how the mean and the dispersion of academic outcomes within groups evolve
as students spend more and more time together over the first three years of their academic tracks. Following our theoretical discussion in Section 2, the different mechanisms of social interactions have different
implications for the relationships between number of meetings (hours) and the mean and dispersion of
performance. Our main testable predictions are the following:
If
If

∂CV (x)
<0
∂m
∂CV (x)
<0
∂m

and
and

∂E(x)
> 0 ⇒ Joint production is the mechanism;
∂m
∂E(x)
< 0 ⇒ Insurance is the mechanism.
∂m

where m is a measure of the number of hours the pair of students spend together. Namely, as the number
of interactions increases, we expect the average grade to increase if joint production is the prevailing
mechanism, to decrease if it is insurance and to stay unchanged if the leading model is decentralization.
The implications for dispersion are less clear cut, as we simply expect the dispersion of grades within
pairs to decrease as the number of meeting or hours spent together increases when the prevailing mechanism is either joint production or insurance (or any combination of the two) and to remain unaffected
if no transition takes place from decentralization to any of the other models.23
We test these predictions in Table 6, where we report the results of the following regressions:
yijcpt = α1 + β1 mijt + γ1t + δ1p + ζ1c + uijcpt

(22)

yijcpt = α2 + β2 mijt + γ2t + ηij + eijcpt

(23)

where yijcpt is, alternatively, the mean grade or the coefficient of variation or the crossing indicator for
pair (i, j), in cohort c, degree program p in year t; mijt measures the number of meetings or hours
student i and j spent together on or before year t. Additionally, we control for year, degree program and
cohort effects: γt , δp , ζc respectively. Equation 23 is a slightly different specification of equation 22,
where we include a pair fixed effect ηij , which obviously also captures the degree program and cohort
effects. uijcpt and vijcpt are random error terms.
It is important to notice that although we conduct our analysis running linear regressions in mijt
our models of interactions suggest a non-linear data generating process, as cooperation and insurance
will occur once the frequency of students interactions crosses a certain threshold. In fact the crosssectional variation in outcomes between students would arise from such non-linearities within a specific
major even if class-sizes and teaching hours were all the same both within and across years. We prefer
the linear specification in the empirical analysis as it is able to capture our testable implications in a
parsimonious way. Further, a non-linear specification would be quite difficult to interpret given that
joint production, insurance and decentralization can coexist in the data.
In addition, detecting non-linearities or threshold effects in our data is particularly complicated for
at least two reasons. First, from the empirical point of view, we do not observe data over the entire
23

If we allow γ to be increasing in m, i.e. the relative importance of one’s peer performance increases in the number of

distribution of hours together. After pairs who have never been assigned to the same class, pairs who
have been assigned together only once already spend around 400 hours in the same classroom. Hence,
we cannot detect any non-linear effect between zero and 400 hours. Secondly, from the theoretical
standpoint, if the thresholds beyond which students start interacting were heterogeneous across pairs
and possibly courses, as it would be reasonable to assume, the possibility to statistically detect any nonlinearity in our main specifications would depend crucially on the distribution of such thresholds along
the distribution of hours together. In fact, in the presence of heterogeneous thresholds non-linearities
may completely disappear.
The computation of the correct variance-covariance matrices for the estimators of the parameters in
equations 22 and 23 is particularly complicated, as our data feature several non-standard characteristics:
(i) the panel dimension (recall that we use one observation for each pair in each academic year); (ii) the
pairwise structure of the observations; (iii) the semi-aggregate level of variation of our main regressor
(hours together, mijt ) and (iv) the network structure.
We take care of the first problem (the panel dimension) in equation 22 by applying the standard
random effect transformation and in equation 23 by transforming the model in orthogonal deviations.24
In the standard textbook panel model, such transformations eliminate any serial correlation as well as
any heteroskedasticity from the error terms, so that the classic random or fixed effects estimators can be
computed by simple ordinary least squares on the transformed data.
We can then take into account the other issues by adjusting the transformed errors. Since such
an adjustment can theoretically be performed under different sets of assumptions, we compute two
alternative versions of the asymptotic z-statistics to support the statistical significance of our estimates.
In the first version we allow the off-diagonal elements of the variance covariance matrix of the
transformed error terms of equations 22 and 23 to be correlated within non-nested clusters defined at the
level of each individual student (i and j) and at the exact level of variation of the key regressor of interest
mijt . More specifically, we assume that the error term uijcpt (eijcpt ) is the sum of three components:
a student i component that induces serial correlation among all pairs where student i is a member, a
student j component that induces serial correlation among all pairs with student j as a member and
a third component that is common to all pairs that share the same value of mijt . As long as these
components are all additive, the random- and fixed-effects transformations do not affect the structure of
the transformed error terms, which remain additive in the three components with the same (qualitative)
variance-covariance matrices.
Hence, we take proper account of the pairwise nature of our data by allowing serial correlation
within clusters at the level of each individual student. Additionally, since our main regressor of interest
24

The standard random effect transformation subtracts q
from each variable in the model (both the dependent and each of the
u
regressors) its within mean scaled by the factor θ = 1 − T σησ+σ
. For example, the random-effects transformed dependent
u
P
T
−1
variable is yijcpt − θy ijcp , where y ijcp = T
t=1 yijcp and T = 3 in our application. Similarly for all the regressors.
The estimates of ση and σu that we use for this transformation are the usual Swamy-Arora, also used by the command xtreg in
Stata (P. A. V. B. Swamy & S. S. Arora 1972). The transformation in orthogonal deviations consists in taking all variables in
the model (both the dependent and each of the regressors) in differences from the within mean of all future values, scaling by
a factor ct that guarantees homoskedasticity (in the absence
of other error components). Foriexample, the dependent variable
h
P
−t
of equation 23 transformed in orthogonal deviations is yijcpt − (T − t)−1 Tk=t+1 yijcpk ct , where c2t = TT−t+1
. Notice
that in the model in orthogonal deviations the time dimension is reduced by one unit, which explains the different number of
observations in columns 2 and 4 of Table 6 compared to columns 1 and 3 (and similarly in Table 7 and Table 9).

19

(mijt ) varies at a more aggregated level that the student pair (i.e. all pairs whose members are assigned
to the same classes in current and previous years are associated to the same value of mijt ) we face a
standard Moulton problem (Brent R. Moulton 1990) and we further allow serial correlation along a third
dimension that corresponds to the exact cells of variation in mijt (such cells of variation are those shown
in Table 5).
Technically, we perform such a three-level clustering using the procedure described in Colin A.
Cameron, Douglas M. Miller & Jonah B. Gelbach (2011), which does not require to specify the form of
the correlation within clusters and is very easy to implement practically even with a large sample like
ours. However, it does not take into account the network structure of our data.
The second version of the asymptotic z-statistics that we compute does take explicit account of the
network by estimating the full variance covariance structure of the error terms under the assumptions
spelled out in detail in Appendix B. In practice we allow for flexible parametric correlation between
the elements of the variance covariance matrix. Given the high computational burden of the matrices
involved in such a computation, we construct those statistics on a 10% random sample of our students.25
Notice that we random draw a sample of student in the first year and construct the full network of those
students so that there is no measurement error in the network structure.26
The identification of the parameters in equations 22 and 23 is straightforward, given that the right
hand side variable of interest (mijt ) is generated exclusively by the random allocation process, hence it
is fully exogenous. Consistently with this interpretation, we obtain very similar estimates across the two
specifications, although including the pair fixed effect ηij substantially improves efficiency.
Obviously, our measure of the strength of social interactions (mijt ) does not necessarily represent
the true number of hours any two students spend together, either studying or engaging in other social
activities. If we were able to observe such true measure of time together, we could use it in equations
22 and 23 instead of mijt . However, such a measure would be endogenous, as people may choose to
spend more time with some classmates for reasons that are connected to academic performance. Hence,
we could use mijt as an instrument for real time together. Then, our results can be interpreted as the
reduced form estimates of this hypothetical IV framework.
Once again, we expect the effect of hours together on the pair’s average performance (i.e βs for
s = 1, 2) to be positive or negative depending on whether the prevailing mechanism is joint production
or insurance, respectively. Our model does not exclude the possibility that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, so that we are really only able to test which one dominates.
[TABLE 6]
The results are reported in Table 6 and Table 7. In columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 we show the estimates
of equations 22 and 23 with the mean grade of the pair as a dependent variable. For ease of interpretation
25

Notice that, given the computational burden, we present both z-statistics only in our main tables 6 and 7. We have
experimented with several draws of similar and smaller sizes and the results are qualitatively unchanged, larger draws are not
feasible even on very powerful machines (above 100Gb of RAM).
26
Since the choice of the mechanism is unlikely to be invariant to the structure of the network, our estimates of the parameters
in equations 22 and 23 based on the full or the 10% random sample may not be comparable. This is the reasons why, for
presentational ease, we prefer to report asymptotic z-statistics rather than standard errors, so as to avoid reporting also the
coefficients estimated on the random sample, which are, however, available from the authors upon request.

20

both the dependent and the explanatory variables in these regressions are normalized within degree
program and academic year, so that the estimated effects can be readily interpreted in terms of standard
deviations. Namely, a one standard deviation increase in the number of hours together (approximately
240 hours) decreases mean performance by 2.2% to 2.7% of a standard deviation, corresponding to
almost 0.05 grade points. It is also interesting to compare the average performance of pairs of students
who are always assigned to the same class for all the three years of their track and pairs of students who
are never assigned to the same class. These two types of student pairs are approximately 6.3 standard
deviations apart in terms of hours together, hence their mean grades are 17% of a standard deviation
apart in favor of the pair who never met, corresponding to almost 0.3 of a grade point. Consistently with
the random nature of mijt , including pair fixed effects in the specification of the model only affects the
coefficients marginally, while it substantially improves the precision of the estimates.
In columns 3 and 4 of Table 6 we report the estimates of equations 22 and 23 with our measure
of grade dispersion as a dependent variable. Results indicate that a one standard deviation increase in
the number of hours together (approximately 240 hours) reduces the coefficient of variation of exam
grades by 0.7-0.9% of a standard deviation. The comparison of pairs at the extreme ends of the hours
distribution indicates that the exam grades of students who are consistently assigned to the same class is
approximately 5% of a standard deviation lower compared to those who never sit courses together.
While the negative relationship between dispersion in performance and the number of hours students
spend together would be consistent with both insurance and joint production (or a combination of the
two), the only mechanism that can rationalize the decline in average performance is insurance.
As discussed in the theoretical section, an additional test to assess the relevance of insurance motives
relies on the time-series properties of students’ performances, i.e. on whether students’ grades in a pair
cross each other. The logic of this crossing property is the following: consider a pair of students who
perfectly share risk by insuring each other (full insurance), then they always exert the same level of
effort, hence their outcomes should be either always identical, in the case of homogenous agents (with
the same Pareto weights), or never cross if agents are heterogeneous. Crossing outcomes are a signal of
less than full insurance. This result has been shown in Cochrane (1991) and Mace (1991) and essentially
restates that under full insurance the ratio of marginal utilities between any two agents is always constant
and equal to the inverse of the ratio of the Pareto weights. Similar tests are produced in Tullio Jappelli
& Luigi Pistaferri (2006) and Mazzocco & Saini (2012) in the consumption literature.
In our application, we expect students to insure more and more as they spend more and more time
together, eventually approaching full insurance (see Section 2.4). We test this prediction by estimating
equations 22 and 23 with the crossing indicator on the left hand side (linear probability model). The
crossing indicator is a simple dummy variable equal to 1 if the vectors of exam grades of student i and
j ever cross over the entire series of compulsory courses taken during year t. The results are reported in
Table 7.
[TABLE 7]
Results show that the likelihood of crossing decreases with the number of hours spent together and
we take this as further evidence consistent with the insurance mechanism. Once again, the estimates
are significant at conventional statistical levels only when conditioning on pair fixed effects (column
21

2). The magnitude of the effect is such that a one standard deviation increase in the number of hours
together reduces the likelihood of crossing by 0.4 percentage points or 1.1% of a standard deviation.
Alternatively, one can look at the difference between pairs of students who are always in the same class
and pairs who are never in the same class, the latter pair would be 2.5 percentage points more likely to
display grade-crossing.

4.1

Further Evidence

A first simple robustness check of our results consists in investigating whether, for any spurious reasons,
future classmates appear to be related in terms of academic outcomes. If that were to happen, our approach would be falsified from the start, as in none of our model we predict a relation between outcomes
of students who have not met yet. In this light, we run a series of placebo regressions where we limit
our sample to the first academic year (i.e. one observation for each pair) and we regress our outcomes
on an indicator for whether the pair will ever meet in the future two years. Results are reported in Table
8 and, consistently with the idea that future meetings should not be related to current outcomes, we find
that all estimates are very close to zero and insignificant.
[TABLE 8]
A second piece of additional evidence addresses the following concern: although the number of
hours together arises from the random allocation process, it might still be that our results on dispersion
and grade crossing are simply the byproduct of the structure of our data. In fact, pairs with more hours
together are more likely than others to have attended courses with the same teachers and, if teachers
are heterogenous, this alone might reduce the variance of outcomes within pairs. Similarly, there could
be cases in which such a reduction in the variance might also lead to a lower probability of crossing
(although one would have to think about some very special cases of teacher heterogeneity). Note that
these concerns bear no implications for the mean outcome of the pair as a function of the number of
meetings.
To address these issues, in Table 9 we augment equations 22 and 23 with a set of dummies for
the classes assigned to each student in the pair (i, j) in every academic year. Overall, there are 12
such dummies (one for each of the 8 classes in Management plus 2 classes in Economics and Economics&Finance) for each student in the pair, for each academic year and each cohort, for a total of 144
dummies. Such class effects are meant to control for the potential bias due to unobservable factors at
the class level, such as teacher quality, class size or class composition, that might be partially collinear
with mijt . Results are qualitatively identical to those in Table 6 and Table 7. Also the magnitude of the
estimates is very comparable, especially for grade crossing.27
[TABLE 9]
The results in the previous section are consistent, within our framework, only with the insurance
mechanism. As it is well known in the literature (Alvarez & Jermann 2000), the level of informal
27

The results are robust to directly controlling for class size in equations 22 and 23.

22

insurance between two parties under limited commitment rests on three fundamental parameters, i.e.
risk aversion, discount rate and correlation of shocks, plus the ability of the parties to monitor and
enforce punishment for deviating behaviors. Although we do not directly observe any of these three
parameters, one might think that gender is an important determinant of the degree of insurance under
the assumption that reciprocal trust and monitoring are easier among same sex pairs.
We explore this idea in Table 10, where we report estimates of equation 23 for samples of pairs
restricted to either same gender (row 1) or mixed gender (row 2) or both females (row 3) or both males
(row 4). Results are remarkably similar across these groups and it only appears that females have a
smaller negative effect on average performance when they interact among themselves.
[TABLE 10]
In Table 11 we further investigate heterogeneity in ability. Although the level of ability of a student
in a pair should not matter for the degree of sustainable insurance in a pair, it is however true that it
could determine the sharing rule, i.e. the more able of the pair gets allocated more time (or resources,
our t parameter in the model) in every state of the world (a higher Pareto weight). Therefore, in order to
be consistent with the proposed mechanism, individual ability (which we measure with the standardized
entry test) should be irrelevant for the relation between our first and second moments of the outcomes
and the exogenous number of hours spent together.
Consistently with this interpretation, in Table 11 we find that, when estimating equation 23 on subsamples defined by ability quartiles of the two students in each pair, results are extremely homogeneous,
especially as far as mean outcomes are concerned.
[TABLE 11]

5

Alternative Mechanisms

So far we have considered three plausible mechanisms that are able to explain what is commonly termed
peer effects or social interactions in the literature. However, it might still be possible that other mechanisms are consistent with our empirical evidence and, although our results bear important policy implications for the specific setting under consideration, their external validity rests crucially on the theoretical
interpretation that we attach to them.
Below we discuss, and for the most part rule out, a series of alternative mechanisms. For example,
one could construct a behavioral model where students get to know each other over time and divert
their attention from studying to other more socializing activities (going out, partying, etc.). Such a
mechanism could easily account for the drop in performance but its implications on the dispersion of
outcomes depend crucially on the assumptions about the size of the drop for the high and low performing
students. If performance declines more at the top of the distribution than at the bottom, dispersion would
be lower, the opposite if the drop is larger at the bottom.
One possible way to adapt such a model to generate lower dispersion in outcomes consists in introducing some kind of preference for equality or conformity (Douglas B. Bernheim 1994, Akerlof 1997),

23

whereby students dislike to perform differently from their friends. In this case students hit by different
types of shocks would help each other. This, however, resembles quite closely our insurance model.
One might think as well that such alternative mechanism is particularly valid for lower ability students, as the forgone benefits of studying instead of partying might be lower for this type of students.
For this purpose, the evidence presented in the previous Section 4.1 (Table 11) is particularly informative, as we find that the estimated effects are pretty homogeneous across ability combinations. Such a
lack of heterogeneity (also across gender) is consistent with insurance, as the insuring parties would not
care about their relative ability but focus on the correlation of shocks and the ability to implement the
informal contract.
Another possibility is that as students know each other better they care more about their relative
performance, in our model this would mean that γ is increasing in m. However, as shown in Proposition
4, if that were the case the mean outcome should increase with the number of meeting, which is the
opposite of what we find in the data.
Further, the disruption model of Edward P. Lazear (2001), adequately modified, might be able to
produce what we observe in the data. However, the Lazear’s model of disruption naturally produces a
negative correlation between group size and performance, while our results in Table 9 are not consistent
with such a story. In fact when we control for class identifiers, which capture, among other things,
the size of the class, we find almost the same results as those in the main Table 6. Moreover, the
simplest disruption model would explain why the mean performance falls but would have very little to
say regarding the cross-sectional variance, unless some further assumptions are made.
An important alternative model is that of social learning, as in (Enrico Moretti 2011), where the
individual consumption of movies is affected by peers’ consumption when the quality of the movie is
uncertain. In our context this could be the case if students interactions can reduce the noise around the
taught material by exchanging information and notes. This seems quite similar to our insurance model
at a first glance, however the similarities between the two mechanisms really depend upon the specific
learning model one has in mind. For example, an extremely simple model of social learning would
essentially translate into a model where the noise in learning, or in our case the size of the shock u, falls
as students interact more frequently. In our setup this could be modeled as t = 1 + u
e, with u
e = u/m.
Where the notation is identical to the one used earlier in the paper. With this formulation it is easy
to show that the average (pairwise) performance would increase in the number of meetings since the
noise u
e would disappear as the number of random meetings increases. In the limit limm→M u
e = 0, so
that uncertainty would disappear and the average performance would be, then, a positive function of the
number of meetings.
Finally, another alternative model could be one where students exhibit preferences for equality.
Such a model could certainly explain the reduced dispersion in outcomes but it would generally display
multiple equilibria, with no predictable impact on average performance. There would be no reason
for a generalized fall in performance, unless all students coordinate to the same low-level equilibrium,
perhaps because of some peculiar institutional features. Furthermore, preferences for equality would not
be enough to explain the observed relationship between the number of meetings and the average and the
dispersion of performance. One would have to make further assumptions about how a student’s interest
for the performance of her friends varies with time spent together. The evidence in Table 11, seems to
24

further reject such a model, as even in ex-ante homogenous pairs we find a reduction in performance,
while that model would predict a clustering at a high level or low level, possibly depending on ability.
In general, it is always possible to propose a behavioral model that can explain our empirical findings
(in fact, any empirical finding) and one possible reading of our contribution is precisely the ability to
explain the patterns of social interactions on the basis of simple economic mechanisms, that are relatively
standard and well established in the literature.

Conclusions

In this paper we propose a set of models of social interactions that generate testable implications capable
of separating them empirically. In particular, we consider three possible mechanisms of interactions: i.
a baseline scenario, where peer effects arise because of reference-based utility; ii. a model of joint production and; iii. one of mutual insurance against shocks to time or productivity. While all mechanisms
predict a reduction in the dispersion of outcomes within groups (pairs) - what is commonly termed peer
effects -, they differ in their implications for average performance, which, compared to the benchmark
case, increases under cooperation and decreases with mutual insurance.
We take these simple predictions to the data using information on two cohorts of undergraduate
Bocconi students, where we can exploit random variation in the number of meetings between students
dictated by repeated random allocation into teaching classes. In this setting, the amount of time any
two students spend together in the same lecturing classrooms is exogenous by definition and drives the
transition from a decentralized model towards a model of insurance or cooperation. We find that the
insurance motive dominates.
Such a result has clear policy implications: in order to increase average performance it would be
beneficial to prevent students from sitting in the same class too often. Alternatively, the university could
introduce incentives that limit the possibility to engage in mutual insurance and encourage cooperation
or joint production.
Although we frame our theoretical discussion as well as the empirical application in the education
setting, our analysis is more general and it applies to many different contexts, from teamwork to academic co-authorship to any environment where social interactions could be important. For example,
if mutual insurance were proven to be the main mechanism of interaction in team production too, the
design of incentive pay schemes, which is one of the fundamental issues in that literature, should take
into account the possibility that workers may endogenously react to the introduction of such schemes by
engaging in some kind of mutual insurance, thus undoing the expected effect on effort. Similarly, in the
production of academic research people explicitly interact through co-authorship, although performance
evaluation is typically carried out at the individual level, primarily via tenure decisions but also with the
allocation of research funds and awards. This is also a setting that resembles our model very closely.
In the theoretical discussion we have assumed away agents’ heterogeneity and endogenous group
formation. Although such an assumption is consistent with our testing strategy, where students are randomly allocated to peers (and fixed effects are accounted for), we should emphasize that one important
implication of our results is that an individual may choose different types of peers depending on whether
the purpose of the group is cooperation or insurance. We also acknowledge that the process of group
25

formation is very important and that the interlink between such process and the choice of the interaction
mode should be investigated thoroughly in future research.

Appendix B

Network-corrected variances

In a network structure all units (nodes) are potentially interlinked, either directly or indirectly. Therefore,
when estimating models where the unit of analysis is a network node, like our models in equations 22
and 23, one needs to allow for the potential structure of correlation among the unobservables of such
units across the network. Our data are further complicated by two additional features: the pairwise
structure and the longitudinal dimension.
As already discussed in the main text, Tables 6 and 7 report our main estimates based on two alternative assumptions about the correlation structure of the error terms in equations 22 and 23. In the
multi-clustered case, we allow pairs which have at least one peer student in common to be correlated
with each other in an unspecified form and we further cluster the observations at the semi-aggregate
level of variation of our main regressor of interest. However, in such specification we abstract from the
network structure of the data.
This is taken into account in the second set of z-statistics that are reported in Tables 6 and 7, where
we estimate the variance-covariance matrices of the parameters element by element, as in a GLS model.
Given the high computational complexity, we perform this exercise on a 10% random sample of our
students. Notice that we do not take a 10% random sample of student pairs but we rather go back to the
original data, select a 10% random sample of individual students and construct the full network for such
a sub-sample, so as to guarantee that the network structure is preserved.
More specifically, in order to compute the network-corrected variance-covariance matrices we first
transform the model by applying the standard random-effects or fixed-effects transformations (as we
also did for the multi-clustered standard errors), which take into account the longitudinal structure of the
data.
Call νijt and ijt the transformed versions of the errors uijt and eijt of equations 22 and 23, where
we dropped the subscripts c and p for notational ease.28 Next, for computational simplicity we assume
homoskedasticity and we set the variance of both νijt and ijt equal to their standard OLS estimators for
all ij and t. Finally, we define the covariance between two generic error terms as follows:
Cov(νijt , νhks ) =

4 X
2
X

ρdl Gdl
(ij)(hk)

(A13)

d=0 l=0

where ρdl is the part of the covariance due to the presence of one network link of distance d observed
either in the same year (t = s, l = 0), one (|t − s| = 1, l = 1) or two years apart (|t − s| = 2, l = 2);
Gdl
(ij)(hk) is the number of such links for the couple of pairs (ij)(hk).
The analog of equation A13 for the fixed-effect model of equation 23 simply replaces νijt with
ijt and sets the upper limit of l to 1, since when taking orthogonal deviations one time observation is
dropped.29
Links of distance one and higher are defined as in the standard network literature: student pairs who
are in the same class (in the same year) are nodes of distance one or direct links; pairs who are not
directly linked but share one (or more) direct links have links of distance two and so on. Notice that
in our framework the network arises due to the repeated random allocations to teaching classes over
academic years, hence, within the same academic year, there can only be direct links (distance one). In
other words, if two pairs are in the same class in year t they have no links of distance two or higher in
the same year, hence Gl0
(ij)(hk) = 0 for link ≥ 2 and for all (ij)(hk).
In order to take into account the pairwise structure of our data we also define links of distance zero,
as those pairs that share either one or the other student.
28
Notice that those subscripts would be redundant in the derivation of this appendix, given that we maintain the assumption
that only the errors of pairs within the same cohort and degree program can be correlated with each other.
29
For formal correctness the parameters ρdl should also be labeled differently.

39

The correlation structure of equation A13 can be easily rationalized with an exogenous process
of network formation generated by semi-aggregate shocks that hit multiple students at the same time.
Students hit by the same shock are directly connected. The process of class formation in our setting
exactly resembles this structure.
To produce the network-corrected variance-covariance matrices we estimate the parameters ρdl of
equation A13 combining observations on the Gdl
(ij)(hk) , which can be computed directly from our data
for each couple of pairs (ij)(hk), and OLS estimates of the covariances Cov(νijt , νhks ).
Practically, we simply regress each off-diagonal element of the variance-covariance matrix of the
OLS residuals of the (transformed) equations 22 and 23 on the observed Gdl
(ij)(hk) . We use the resulting
dl
estimates of the parameters ρ to compute the network corrected variance-covariance matrices. Other
estimation procedure are possible, such as GMM or minimum distance estimators, but are all equivalent
in our setting.30
Our sample includes over 800,000 pairs, observed over 3 years, resulting in almost 2.5 million
observations. Hence, there are almost 3 trillions unique off-diagonal elements in the variance-covariance
matrix of equation 22.31 Thus, the practical implementation of our procedure to compute networkcorrected standard errors is extremely demanding in terms of computing power. For this reason, we
select a 10% random subsample of students and consider only the full network for these students when
computing the network-corrected estimates.
Since the choice of the mechanism is unlikely to be invariant to the structure of the network, our
estimates of the parameters in equations 22 and 23 based on the full or the 10% random sample may not
be comparable. For presentational convenience we prefer to report asymptotic z-statistics rather than
standard errors, so as to avoid reporting also the coefficients estimated on the random sample, which
are, however, available from the authors upon request.

30
In order to improve efficiency, the entire procedure could also be iterated until some convergence, however, given the
computational burden of this exercise, we report the first set of estimates. Moreover, one could further improve the procedure
ee
by imposing exogenous constraints on the parameters ρdl . For example, it would seem reasonable to require ρdl > ρdl , for
any d > de or l > e
l. Our unconstrained estimates do satisfy such conditions.
31
When taking orthogonal deviations in equation 23 one time observation for each pair is dropped and the resulting sample
is 1/3 smaller.
