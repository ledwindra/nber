    "abstract": "\n\nRecent litigation against major tobacco companies culminated in a  Master Settlement Agreement' (MSA) under which the participating companies agreed to compensate most states for Medicaid expenses. We outline the terms of the settlement and analyze whether it was a move toward economic efficiency using data from Massachusetts.  Medicaid spending will fall, but only a modest amount ($0.1 billion). The efficiency issue turns mainly on the treatment of health benefits from reduced smoking induced by the settlement.  We conclude that the settlement was a move towards economic efficiency.\n\n",
