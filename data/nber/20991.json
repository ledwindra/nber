    "abstract": "\n\nStock prices react significantly to the tone (negativity of words) managers use on earnings conference calls. This reaction reflects reasonably rational use of information. \u201cTone surprise\u201d \u2013 the residual when negativity in managerial tone is regressed on the firm\u2019s recent economic performance and CEO fixed effects \u2013 predicts future earnings and analyst uncertainty. Prices move more, as hypothesized, in firms where tone surprise predicts more strongly. Experienced analysts respond appropriately in revising their forecasts; inexperienced analysts overreact (underreact) to tone surprises in presentations (answers). Post-call price drift, like post-earnings announcement drift, suggests less-than-full-use of information embedded in managerial tone.\n\n",
