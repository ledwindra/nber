ABSTRACT
The conventional wisdom is (i) that fiscal austerity was the main culprit for the recessions experienced
by many countries, especially in Europe, since 2010 and (ii) that this round of fiscal consolidation
was much more costly than past ones. The contribution of this paper is a clarification of the first point
and, if not a clear rejection, at least it raises doubts on the second. In order to obtain these results we
construct a new detailed "narrative" data set which documents the actual size and composition of the
fiscal plans implemented by several countries in the period 2009-2013. Out of sample simulations,
that project output growth conditional only upon the fiscal plans implemented since 2009 do reasonably
well in predicting the total output fluctuations of the countries in our sample over the years 2010-13
and are also capable of explaining some of the cross-country heterogeneity in this variable. Fiscal
adjustments based upon cuts in spending appear to have been much less costly, in terms of output
losses, than those based upon tax increases. The difference between the two types of adjustment is
very large. Our results, however, are mute on the question whether the countries we have studied did
the right thing implementing fiscal austerity at the time they did, that is 2009-13. Finally we examine
whether this round of fiscal adjustments, which occurred after a financial and banking crisis, has had
different effects on the economy compared to earlier fiscal consolidations carried out in "normal" times.
When we test this hypothesis we do not reject the null, although in some cases failure to reject is marginal.
In other words, we don't find sufficient evidence to claim that the recent rounds of fiscal adjustment,
when compared with those occurred before the crisis, have been especially costly for the economy.

Introduction

The de cit reduction policies (often referred to as scal austerity) followed
by several OECD countries in 2009-13 were designed to o¤set the expansionary increase in government spending sparked in previous years by the
subprime lending crisis. They were certainly not adopted because the economy was weak and predicted to fall further: rather they were implemented
while recessions were not quite over and a credit crunch was still getting in
the way of the recovery. The aim of this paper is to provide an empirical
measure of the e¤ects of these de cit reduction policies on output growth.
The Fall of 2014, when we write, is probably the earliest time when one can
begin to assess the e¤ects of these policies.
We analyse the main features of scal adjustment policies, starting from
their composition: how they were divided between tax increases and spending
cuts, and what has been their cost in terms of output losses. We also examine
whether this round of scal adjustments, which occurred after a nancial and
banking crisis, has had di¤erent e¤ects on the economy compared to earlier
scal consolidations carried out in normal times. In addition, contrary
to previous episodes of scal consolidation, this time many countries implemented de cit reduction policies all at the same time, possibly deepening
their recessionary e¤ects due to interdependence of their economies.
We proceed as follows. We start by documenting in detail how austerity
has been implemented in each country. This is not an easy task: scal
adjustment plans have often been complex, extending over several years,
repeatedly modi ed in mid-course, sometimes even drastically because of
political bickering. Then, we evaluate the e¤ects of such policies on output
growth. Since the scal corrections implemented in the years 2009-2013 (as
most scal corrections) came, as we said, in the form of multi-year plans,
rather than one year moves, we need a model capable of simulating the e¤ects
of plans rather than isolated shifts in scal variables. We estimate such a
model with data running up to (but not including) the years 2009-13. Then
we simulate the model out of sample (that is over the years 2009-13) feeding
in the actual plans adopted in those ve years. This strategy allows us to
analyze not only the output e¤ects of austerity as actually implemented, but
also to ask what the e¤ect on output growth would have been, had the same
scal contractions been implemented in a di¤erent fashion, e.g. relying less
on tax increases and more on spending cuts.
Our main nding is that scal adjustments based upon cuts in spend1

ing are much less costly, in terms of output losses, than those based upon
tax increases. Our evidence indicates that the di¤erence between the two
types of adjustment is very large. Over our estimation period (1978-2007)
the average tax-based adjustment plan with an initial size of one per cent
of GDP results in a cumulative contraction in GDP of two per cent in the
following three years. On the contrary, spending-based adjustments generate
very small recessions with an impact on output growth not signi cantly different from zero. In this respect the recent episodes of austerity do not look
di¤erent from previous ones. Out of sample simulations of our model, that
project output growth conditional only upon the scal plans implemented
since 2009, do reasonably well in predicting the total output uctuations of
the countries in our sample over the years 2010-13, and they are also capable
of explaining some of the cross-country heterogeneity in this variable. The
results are particularly strong for those countries in which the main shock
in that period was indeed a scal policy one. For example, the tax-based
adjustment implemented in Italy in 2010-13 is su¢cient by itself to explain
the recession experienced by the country over the period 2011-2012 (with
negative GDP growth of around 2 per cent in each year).
When we test explicitly the hypothesis that recent scal adjustments had
the same e¤ect on output growth as past ones, we do not reject the null,
although in some cases failure to reject is marginal. In other words, we dont
nd su¢cient evidence to claim that the recent rounds of scal adjustment,
when compared with those occurred before the crisis, have been especially
costly for the economy. This evidence suggests that the scal multipliers estimated using data from the pre-crisis period give valuable information about
the amount of output loss associated with the post-crisis scal consolidation
measures. Blanchard and Leigh (2013) come to a di¤erent conclusion: they
argue that the costs of scal adjustments have been higher in recent years
than previously estimated and therefore expected. The di¤erence between
our results and theirs depends upon the fact that we construct forecast errors
which are conditional only upon de cit-driven scal consolidations. Instead,
the forecast errors constructed in Blanchard and Leigh are conditional upon a
scenario for all the exogenous variables that enter the IMF forecasting model
they use. To put it di¤erently, if the current rounds of scal adjustments had
been marginally more costly than before (but the evidence is murky on this
point) this di¤erence would be explained by concurrent variables, say the
credit crunch, not by a change in scal multipliers between the years before
and after the crisis.
2

It is important to note from the start that this paper has nothing to say
about the optimality of the scal adjustments implemented over the years
2009-13. Our more limited goal is to show that there was signi cant heterogeneity in the e¤ects of such policies depending on their composition, taxes
vs. spending. Optimal policy can be discussed only within the framework
of a structural model. The objective of our empirical paper is to highlight
empirical evidence to be matched by structural models. The evidence we propose here can be used to select among di¤erent structural models: it cannot
be used to discuss optimal policy.
This paper builds upon an earlier literature which had tried to assess
the costs of scal adjustments using data up to 2007. That literature faced
two key challenges. One was how to identify exogenous shifts in scal policy, namely shifts determined purely by the need to reduce excessive de cits
and not as a response to the state of the economic cycle. The second challenge was to isolate the e¤ect of scal policy from many other intervening
factors such as devaluations, monetary policy, labor and product market reforms etc. This earlier literature, surveyed in Alesina and Ardagna (2010),
used large changes in the cyclically-adjusted budget de cit as a measure of
exogenous scal adjustments. Using various samples and various modelling
choices, these papers consistently found that scal consolidations based on
spending cuts had been much less costly than those based on tax increases.
In fact, in some cases, spending cuts were even slightly expansionary, that is
associated with almost immediate increases in growth, thus con rming much
earlier ndings by Giavazzi and Pagano (1990). Concerning the importance
of accompanying policies, Alesina and Ardagna (2013) investigated to what
extent such policies, in particular labor market reforms, have helped the success of some scal adjustments. While devaluations in some cases did help
(see Ireland in 1988) they were not consistently the driving force of successful
adjustments. Perotti (2013) also emphasizes how critical accompanying policies are, arguing that one should never study budget cuts in isolation from
other policy changes.
Cyclically-adjusted budget numbers, however, are unable to lter out all
scal policy actions correlated with the cycle: for instance, discretionary
measures adopted in response to a recession are not ltered out of cyclicallyadjusted numbers This methodology is thus suggestive, but imperfect. The
limitations of studies that identify shifts in scal policy using cyclicallyadjusted budget numbers have been overcome by the narrative method pioneered by Romer and Romer (2010). These authors use original sources (bud3

get documents, records of Congressional debates, etc.) to identify episodes
of changes in US tax rates that were not dictated by the cycle, but were
motivated either by the aim of improving long run growth or of reducing an inherited de cit. Applying this identi cation strategy, Romer and
Romer (2010) estimate large tax multipliers: over the course of three years
an increase in taxes equivalent to one percent of GDP lowers output by
three percent.1 Devries et al (2011) have used this methodology to construct a narrative time series of shifts in scal policy (in this case both taxes
and spending) for 17 OECD countries since the early 1970s. The shifts in
taxes and spending identi ed by these authors are solely motivated by the
need to reduce an inherited de cit  a de nition which ts precisely the scal consolidation episodes adopted in Europe since 2009-10. Guajardo et
al (2014) have used these data to estimate scal multipliers and also nd
that tax-based adjustments were more costly, in terms of output losses, than
expenditure-based ones, a result consistent with the earlier literature based
upon cyclically adjusted de cits.
Alesina, Favero and Giavazzi (2014, AFG in what follows) use the scal consolidation episodes identi ed by Devries et al (2011), but propose a
methodological innovation. They start from the observation that the shifts
in taxes and spending that contribute to a scal adjustment almost never
happen in isolation: they are typically part of a multiyear plan, in which
some policies are announced well in advance, while other are implemented
unexpectedly and, importantly, both tax hikes and spending cuts are used
simultaneously. Also, as these plans unfold, they are often revised and these
changes have to be taken into account as they constitute new information
available to economic agents. AFG show that ignoring the connections between changes in taxes and expenditures, and between unanticipated and
announced changes, might produce biased estimates of the e¤ects of scal
consolidations. Their results once again con rm a large di¤erence between
expenditure-based adjustments and tax-based ones. AFG also show that
the shifts in monetary policy that accompany scal adjustments cannot explain the results  although this does not rule out the possibility that other
contemporaneous economic reforms may make certain plans less costly than
others.
The model estimated in AFG is the framework we use in this paper to

estimate the e¤ects scal consolidations on output growth over the years
preceding 2009 (the model is actually estimated using data up to 2007). We
then simulate the model out-of-sample (that is over the years 2009-13) feeding
in the actual adjustments plans implemented by ten EU countries and by
the US in those ve years. Finally, we shall run counter-factual experiments
asking what the e¤ect on output growth would have been, had the same scal
contraction been implemented in a di¤erent fashion, for instance with less
tax hikes and more expenditure cuts.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present an overview
of scal austerity in Europe after the crisis. In Section 3 we describe the
construction of our data and we illustrate the way in which we identify scal
plans. We describe in detail one case (Portugal) to illustrate our methodology. Detailed information on the plans adopted by all other countries is
available in a web appendix2 . In Section 4 we present our model and our experiments. We rst show the output e¤ects of scal plans in the sample over
which the model is estimated; we then show out-of-sample simulations, that is
the results obtained feeding into the estimated model the actual adjustments
implemented by each country in 2010-13; next we present the counterfactual experiment, and nally a discussion of robustness. Section 5 analyzes
the question whether recent scal adjustments have been more costly than
earlier ones. The last Section concludes.

Fiscal policy in the aftermath of the nancial crisis

Many European economies did not enter the nancial crisis with a clean scal slate. Before the crisis, debts and de cits were already high in several of
them. One reason were the low interest rates of the rst decade of the Euro,
which had facilitated large debt build-ups in in the European periphery. The
country with the largest debt was Italy, with a ratio to GDP of 1.06 in 2008;
Greece had a ratio of 1. But even countries with apparently better scal
positions (such as Spain and Ireland) still had budget de cits, notwithstanding an exceptional (and unsustainable) level of revenues accruing from a real
estate bubble. However, concerns about scal sustainability were not limited
to the European periphery. Many countries faced the challenge posed by the

rapid aging of their populations: social expenditure had increased from an
average of 18% of GDP in 1980 to 25% and 2009, with a rise of 5 percentage
points of GDP in just the 10 years preceding 2009.3 Moreover, total government spending, even if reduced at the end of the 90s to meet the Maastricht
criteria, was still high in 2007 (43 percent in 2007 in the EU average). The
average share of public spending over GDP had increased from 34% in 1970
to 43% in 2007 in the OECD economies.4
Government budgets, which were already structurally weak, worsened
very signi cantly with the start of the nancial crisis, in many cases because
governments had to foot the bill of distressed nancial institutions, Ireland
being the most apparent example. The average de cit in the EU almost
doubled between 2007 and 2008 reaching 6.4% of GDP in 2009 (See Table
1). In the United States the de cit increased from 2.7 to 13.3 percent of
GDP.5 As a consequence debt ratios jumped: from 66.5% of GDP in 2007 to a
projected 109.2% in 2014 in the US; from 66.5% to 95.3% in the euro area (See
Table 2). Besides automatic stabilizers, discretionary scal actions, aimed
at slowing the rise in unemployment and protecting unemployed workers,
played a crucial role, though to a di¤erent extent from country to country.
The discretionary response was relatively small in Germany and Italy, while
Spain, Portugal, the UK and France implemented a large increase of the
cyclically adjusted de cit (See Table 1).6
[INSERT TABLES 1 and 2 HERE]
Large increases in budget de cits meant that many European countries,
around 2009, entered the EU Excessive De cit Procedure, that is their scal
policies started being monitored by the European Commission.7 After the
start of the Greek crisis, in the spring of 2010, there were renewed anxieties
about the unsustainability of public debt in some European countries and
investors demanded higher interest rates on government bonds: yields spiked
throughout the European periphery. At the same time, these pressures raised

concerns in public opinions. The share of articles discussing scal consolidation was marginal during the rst years of the nancial crisis, but rapidly
increased in 2010, typically reaching a peak around the end of 2011 (See
Figure 1).8
[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]
Responding to these pressures, most European countries began scal consolidations, enacting, starting in 2010, multi-year de cit reduction programs,
notwithstanding mediocre growth projections for the years to come.
Figure 2 shows how the scal policy of Euro Area economies changed
overtime, in relation to the economic cycle. For every year we show the
change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance and the level of the output
gap. The rst and third quadrants represent instances of counter-cyclical
scal policy where governments squeeze the public budget while the economy is overheating, and vice versa. On the contrary, the second and fourth
quadrants include years in which scal policy was pro-cyclical. The majority of the countries in the sample adopted counter-cyclical scal policies at
the beginning of the recession (2008-09) but turned pro-cyclical after 2009,
namely scal consolidations started when recessions were not over yet.
[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE]
The evidence in Figure 2 raises a natural question on the optimality of
such counter-cyclical scal actions. As discussed in the introduction, our
paper cannot answer this question. We cannot pass judgment on the pros
and cons and on the timing of the scal adjustments. Our more limited aim
is to investigate whether the e¤ects of such adjustments were a¤ected, and to
what extent, by their composition (taxes vs. spending) and their persistence
and predictability.
Together with these budgetary policies, structural reforms were also introduced in some countries. For instance, most of the countries in our sample
implemented some labor and product market reforms (see OECD, 2014a).

Data on the share of articles regarding the scal consolidation debate were gathered
from Factiva from January 2006 to January 2014.

Spain introduced a very signi cant labor market reform (see OECD, 2014a);
Italy, France and Spain implemented pension reforms in 2010 and 2011.9
Even though not driven by high borrowing costs, scal consolidation entered the policy agenda of some non-European economies as well. In the
United States the fear for the sustainability of the public debt  and the
downgrade of the US government bonds by S&P for the rst time in history
 was the main motivation behind the adoption of the measures included in
the Budget Control Act approved in 2011 and the ensuing debate over the
Fiscal Cli¤. In the web-appendix, we analyze these scal consolidation
actions country by country. In the next section we show, using the example
of Portugal, how we measure the scal plans adopted by each country, how
we classify them as tax-based or expenditure-based and how we account for
their changes over time.
Eventually, in 2013, the year our analysis stops, the intensity of the scal
consolidation e¤ort decreased almost everywhere in Europe  in part because
some countries, such as Italy, Ireland and Portugal, were able to exit the Excessive De cit Procedure, in part because Mario Draghis famous words, We
will do whatever it takes, resulted in a signi cant reduction in borrowing
costs and alleviated the risk of a debt crisis.

In Italy the 2010 Budget Law raised the retirement age for old-age pensions for females
working in the public sector starting from January 2012, introducing the same retirement
age for men and women. In 2011 a new reform increased the old-age retirement age for
women in the private sector from 60 to 62 years starting in 2012, with a gradual increase
up to 66 years by 2018, whereas the male retirement age was increased to 66 years in
2012. Retirement ages and the seniority rules for early retirement were also indexed to
life expectancy. On top of this, pension indexation was suspended for two years. Finally,
the reform speeds up the transition from the de ned bene t to the de ned contribution
schemes.In France various measures were taken with the 2010 Pension Reform to encourage
the employment of older workers. The mandatory retirement age was raised from 65 to
70 years; a wider use of the pension premium was introduced and a greater exibility
for combining earned and pension income was guaranteed. Moreover, the extension of
the contribution period as a function of rising life expectancy was approved, although
indexation is not automatic.In Spain the pension reform is implemented in 2011 with the
rst measures entering in o¢ce in 2013. The Reform increased the retirement age from 65
to 67 years, while early retirement was delayed from 61 to 63 years. Moreover, the number
of years required to reach the 100 percent of the reference wage increased from 35 to 37
years of contribution.

Fiscal consolidations in 2009-2013
Constructing and classifying scal plans

The scal consolidations implemented in 2009-2013 were multi-year scal
plans. We measure and classify these plans extending the database running
from 1976 to 2007 that was constructed by AFG for 17 OECD countries.
The plans in AFG were in turn constructed reclassifying the annual shifts in
scal policy  not driven by an output stabilization motive  identi ed by
Devries et al (2011), whose assumptions we discussed in the introduction.
Since the Devries et al (2011) data stop in 2007, we follow their methodology
to identify the exogenous shifts in scal policy occurred after 2009, and then
use them to build scal plans following the methodology of AFG.
Fiscal plans are combinations of unexpected and announced scal corrections. When a Parliament votes a de cit reduction policy at time t and
implements it in the same year, we call it unexpected: eu .10 The latter represents a reduction of the de cit over GDP ratio. This reduction may come
from a reduction in spending over GDP ratio (denoted by g) or an increase
in the tax revenues over GDP ratio (denoted by  ). When a correction is
voted by Parliament in year t but is implemented in year t + k (where k is
the anticipation horizon), it is called announced, with horizon k: eat;k . As
time goes by, and a correction announced in year t for year t + k; eat;k , comes
closer to the date of implementation, its horizon is correspondingly reduced:
eat+1;k 1 . The shift in the index of the announced adjustment continues until the adjustment is actually implemented in year t + k. In that year it is
labelled eat+k;0 . All the de cit reduction polices, both announced and implemented, are divided in tax increases and spending cuts, both measured as
fraction of GDP. After plans have been constructed we distinguish between
Tax-Based (TB) and Expenditure-Based (EB) plans. We label a scal adjustment respectively as TB and EB if the sum of the unexpected plus the
announced tax (expenditure) changes (measured as percent of the GDP of
the year the plan is introduced) is larger than the sum of the unexpected plus
the announced expenditure (tax) changes. Note that since plans sometime
change in mid-course  due to political bickering or because a government
falls and is followed by a new one  a plan which started, say, as EB may

In principle even a policy announced and implemented immediately might have been
expected, but without an o¢cial announcement it is virtually impossible to measure the
degree of surprise of a new policy, as disused in more detail in AFG.

turn into a TB one, or the other way around. In Section 4.4.3 we explore
a di¤erent way of classifying scal adjustments abandoning the TB and EB
dummy de nitions and exploiting separately the magnitude of revenue and
expenditure changes. Our empirical results are robust to this reclassi cation.
The countries which we consider are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United
States.11
We now show how, using this framework, we have constructed scal consolidation plans over the years 2009-2013 for each country in our sample. We
start, in Table 3, providing some descriptive statistics.
[INSERT TABLE 3]

3.2

Fiscal consolidation plans after the nancial crisis

The countries in our sample can be divided into three groups. The rst includes the countries in the core of the Euro area that on average experienced
less serious nancial trouble; the second includes countries in the periphery; the third group includes three countries outside EMU, which we use as
examples of advanced economies with exible exchange rates.
To identify exogenous shifts in scal policy we used the Stability and
Convergence Reports of the European Commission, national budget reports,
central bank reports, and Congressional Budget O¢ce documents and Economic Reports of the President for the US. The detailed motivations for the
de cit-driven scal consolidation plans from 2009 to 2013 and a description
of how we retrieved the data are available in the web-appendix. Section
3.3 discusses the di¤erences between our narrative shocks and the cyclically
adjusted measures, and compares our data to other narrative measures.
We illustrate our methodology with the example of Portugal. In the webappendix we show how the same procedure was applied to all other countries
in our sample.

11

Greece and Cyprus have been excluded because the data required to include these
countries in the panel used to estimate the model were not available  and if they were,
as could be the case of Greece, such data have since been extensively revised.

Portugal started a very aggressive scal consolidation plan in 2010, under nancial pressure on government bonds and liquidity concerns. Between
2010 and 2013 the measures adopted amounted, on average, to 4 percentage points of GDP per year for four consecutive years: this can be seen in
the table above summing the terms eu and ea(t+k;0) thus computing the direct
impact on the budget of each year of the measures adopted. In 2010 the budget de cit was reduced by 1:16% of GDP, of which 0:63 percent of revenues
u
u
increase (2010
in the table above) and 0:53 of spending cuts (g2010
). Expenditure cuts involved wage restraints for civil servants, some cuts to social
bene ts and reductions to the operating expenditure of ministries. Revenue
increases included an increase in the VAT rate and an increase in personal
and corporate income taxes. The same 2010 Budget also introduced new
expenditure cuts amounting to 1:41 percent of GDP and new tax increases
a
and
of 1:43 percent to be implemented in 2011 (they are respectively 2010;1
a
g2010;1 ). These announcements anticipated a further tightening of the 2010
expenditure measures and limitations to bene ts and allowances related to
the personal income tax. The rst row of the above table illustrates the way
in which we use this narrative record to construct the 2010 scal plan.
The sovereign debt crisis began in Portugal in November 2010, when the
yield on the countrys 10-year government bonds reached 7 percent. In April
2011, Prime Minister José Sócrates, who had resigned and was heading a
transition government, announced that the country would request nancial
assistance. In May 2011 when the interest rates on debt had reached 10%,
Eurozone leaders approved a e 78 billion bailout package for Portugal. As
part of the deal, the country agreed to cut its budget de cit from 9:8 percent
of GDP in 2010 to 5:9 percent in 2011, 4:5 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in
2013.
Note, in our table, that in 2011 a more comprehensive and longer adjustment program was designed as a condition for economic and nancial
assistance. The 0:6 percent of GDP of unexpected expenditure cuts focused

on public sector wages and public investments. The 0:5 percent of GDP
of unexpected tax consolidation mainly involved a personal income tax surcharge on workers 13th salary. The scal consolidation plan included more
spending-based measures to be implemented by 2013. However, in both 2012
and 2013, the plan was modi ed with unexpected changes in the anticipated
components of previously approved budgets.
The last two columns of the table show that this classi cation strategy
leads to label the Portuguese plan in 2010 and 2013 as tax-based, and in 2011
and 2012 as expenditure-based. It is not uncommon for a plan to change its
nature over time. In the case of Portugal, the change from EB to TB in
2013 was mostly due to the cancellation of some announced expenditure cuts
(mostly reductions in public sector wages) by the Constitutional Court in
June 2012. In order not to miss the de cit targets, the Portuguese government compensated these vanished expenditure cuts with new tax measures
involving a revision of the personal income tax structure resulting in a reduction in the number of brackets, combined with 4 percent general surcharge of
taxable income and a 2:5 percent solidarity tax on the highest tax bracket.

This is clearly visible in the change from 2011;2
= 0:4 to 2011;1
= 2:1 and
a
a
from g2011;2 = 1:4 to g2011;1 = 0:8 that in turn causes the plan to be predominantly tax-based in 2013.
In 2013, the government implemented a debt recovery scheme for overdue
tax and social security contributions, to be implemented before the end of the
year and coded as an unexpected 0:4 shift. Given the one-o¤ nature of this
scheme, we code its reversal in the following year as a negative announcement:
a
2013;1
= 0:4. Moreover, even though in April 2013 a further Constitutional
Court decision ruled out cuts worth 0:8 percent of GDP, these were totally
compensated by the frontloading of 0:8 percent of GDP from the expenditure
review program.
In the web-appendix we go over each countrys experience as we did here
for Portugal and we illustrate the methodology and the sources we used to
construct our scal plans.
Before moving to our results a few observations are in order.
 The size of the scal adjustments in many countries was large, especially in Spain, Ireland and Italy, in addition to Portugal as we have
seen. In other countries, like Great Britain or Belgium, it was more
moderate. In others (Germany and the US) it was relatively small.
Ireland hit a 30% de cit over GDP ratio in 2010 as a result of the bail
12

out of banks, but even leaving this episode aside, the Irish adjustment
was very large.
 Even in those countries with large adjustments (say Spain and Portugal) the size of them was not unprecedented in recent history. As
shown in Table 3, column 3, the average consolidation impact is 3:4%
of GDP per year in Portugal, a size that has been observed on several
occasions in our estimation sample, e.g. Italy 1992, Denmark 1983,
Sweden 1995, Ireland 1982.
 In certain countries (Ireland and Spain for instance) banking crises were
the main determinants of the scal imbalances. In others (Portugal or
Italy for instance) de cits and accumulated debts were the main drivers.
In either case however the key exogeneity assumption regarding the
cycle is preserved.
 The composition of adjustments between spending cuts and tax hikes
varied across countries. For instance in the case of Italy the adjustments
were all tax-based (at least until 2013). In the case of Ireland and
Great Britain they were mostly spending-based. Spain was somewhere
in between, although but more on spending than on taxes.
 The plans are generally a combination of expected and unexpected
scal changes. Only in the case of Ireland there were no announcements
of future policies during the adjustments.
 Many plans were revised in mid-course several times, as a result of political bickering. In Italy for example three di¤erent governments were
in o¢ce between 2009 and 2013, including a technical one appointed
with the speci c task of improving the scal stance of the country at a
moment when it was on the verge of scally imploding.
 In Italy, Spain and France pension reforms were implemented with
potential savings accruing in future years. Probably the sharpest one,
in terms of expected scal savings, was implemented in Italy.
 Spain introduced a reform to liberalize the labor market. Hardly any
other structural reforms were implemented in any other country, at
least until 2013 included.

13

 In the US the discretionary scal measures were implemented as a result
of the extremely hot debate over the so-called  scal cli¤. Despite the
rhetoric in the debate, in the end the discretionary actions taken were
very small.

3.3

Comparison with cyclically adjusted measures and
other narrative data

We conclude this section comparing our narrative measure of scal policy
with the cyclically-adjusted measures employed in some part of the literature.
In Figure 3 we plot our measure against (i) the change in the cyclicallyadjusted structural balance and (ii) the change in the primary balance for
each country in our sample, as constructed by the IMF. The trend in the
IMF structural measure is similar to ours and obviously less volatile than
the uncorrected change in primary balance. Notice that in 2009 our measure
is almost always equal to zero given that no exogenous consolidation policies
were implemented. The discretionary policies implemented in 2008-09 were
part of scal stimulus plans intended to recover from the crisis and thus
must be considered endogenous. Hence, contrary to our measure, the change
in the cyclically-adjusted structural de cit in 2009 is negative for almost
every country. This raises a major concern about the use of changes in the
cyclically-adjusted structural balance for the identi cation of exogenous shifts
in scal policies. Note in particular that the smallest di¤erences between
our data and the structural cyclically-adjusted primary balance appear in
countries which did not implement signi cant scal stimuli in response to
the crisis, like Germany and Italy.
For the years after 2009-10 the trend in the IMF cyclically-adjusted structural measure is very similar to our narrative data. However, it almost always
lies below our narrative changes. This is due to several factors. First, implemented consolidation measures were sometimes mitigated by discretionary
anti-cyclical measures (which we exclude from our analysis because endogenous). Second, our data refer to ex-ante predictions of policy impacts, while
the IMF measures refer to ex-post de cit outcomes.

Other narrative measures
14

DellErba et al (2013) and A¼
gca and Igan (2013) have also constructed
narrative data for the countries in our sample for the years 2010 and 2011.
DellErba et al (2013) base their construction on the estimates provided by
the 2011 OECD publication Restoring Public Finances. A¼
gca and Igan
(2013) complement the DellErba et al (2013) using IMF Article IV Sta¤
Reports, OECD Country Reports and national budgets. Both these works,
however, do not take into account the multi-year feature of scal plans and
thus do not collect data about announcements. Moreover, they only cover
the years 2010 and 2011 when scal consolidations were not as relevant as
in 2012 and 2013. Indeed, only a few countries started scal adjustments
in 2010, while all countries in our sample implemented scal actions in 2012
and 2013. Furthermore, the average size of scal consolidations in 2012-13
is around 2%, against 1:3% for 2010-11. Our narrative episodes for 2010 and
2011 do not di¤er signi cantly from their estimates.

The output e¤ects of scal consolidations

The analysis of the output e¤ects of economic policy requires  for the correct
estimation of the relevant parameters  identifying policy shifts that are
exogenous with respect to output uctuations. In the context of scal policy
the concepts of exogeneity and identi cation are further illustrated in section
4.1 and discussed in the Appendix. As we already mentioned, for the sample
used to estimate our model (1978-07) we identify scal stabilizations designed
to o¤set changes in government spending implemented in the past. Such
stabilizations are not motivated by contemporaneous cyclical uctuations
and are therefore likely to be exogenous with respect to output growth. In
practice we use the narrative data collected by Devries et al (2011) and
revised in AFG. By construction these scal adjustments are predictable by
previous scal expansions. There is also evidence that scal adjustments
identi ed with the narrative method are predictable from their own past (see
the Appendix). We interpret this evidence as a consequence of the fact that
scal policy is conducted through multi-year plans. In this section we show
how plans and their output e¤ect can be correctly estimated and simulated.
Predictability and exogeneity are not the same concept as we discuss in
section 4.1.
When scal policy is conducted in country i through multi-year plans,
narrative exogenous scal adjustments in each year, fi:t , include three com15

ponents: unexpected adjustments (announced upon implementation at time
t) euit , past announced adjustments (implemented at time t but announced
in previous years) eait;0 and future announced corrections (considering, for
simplicity, the case in which the horizon of the plan is only one year, these
corrections are announced at time t for implementation at time t + 1) eait;1 :
fi:t = euit +eait;0 +eait;1
where the letter e represents the sum of the two components of a
scal adjustment: tax increases and spending cuts.
A scal plan is speci ed by making explicit the relation between announcements and the other two components of a plan. In particular, we
consider
eait;1 = '1i euit + v1;it
eai;t+1;0 = eait;1
The rst is a behavioral relation that captures the style with which scal
policy is implemented. More permanent plans will feature signi cantly positive '1i , while a temporary plan (to be reversed, at least partially in the
future) will feature a signi cantly negative '1i .
The second relationship simply states that the announced correction implemented at time t is equal to what was announced in the previous period
with a scal foresight of one period. Note that this does not imply that all
announced corrections are implemented but it does imply that deviations
of implemented corrections from those announced are always considered as
surprises by all agents.
In the next section we shall illustrate how we deal with plans in a model
designed to measure their e¤ect on output, and how we use the estimated
model to perform out-of-sample simulations. Before doing this, however, we
briey discuss how plans are identi ed.

4.1

The identi cation of exogenous scal plans

Exogeneity of the shifts in scal policy for the estimation of their output
e¤ect means that they should not be correlated with news on output growth,
i.e with the cycle. The traditional steps to identify such exogenous shifts
involved rst the estimation of a joint dynamic model for the structure of the
16

economy and the variables controlled by the policy-makers (typically a VAR).
The residuals in the estimated equation for the policy variables approximate
deviations of policy from a rule. Such deviations, however, do not yet measure
exogenous shifts in policy because a part of them could represent a reaction
to contemporaneous information on the state of economy. In order to recover
structural shocks from VAR innovations some restrictions are required. In
the case of monetary policy identi cation can be achieved exploiting the fact
that central banks take their policy decisions at regular intervals (e.g. there
are eight FOMC meetings every year) and there is consensus on the fact that
it takes at least one period between two meetings before the economy reacts
to such decisions. This triangular structure  innovations in the monetary
policy variable reect both monetary policy and macroeconomic shocks, but
macroeconomic variables are not contemporaneously a¤ected by monetary
policy shocks  is su¢cient for identi cation.
Fiscal policy is di¤erent, in the sense that it is conducted through rare
decisions and, as discussed above, is typically implemented through multiyear plans. Such plans generate  scal foresight: agents learn in advance
future announced measures. The consequence is that the number of shocks to
be mapped out of the VAR innovations is too high to achieve identi cation:
technically the Moving Average representation of the VAR becomes noninvertible.
As a consequence of this speci c feature of scal policy, after initial e¤orts
at adapting the identi cation scheme used for monetary policy, attempts at
mapping VAR innovations into scal shocks have become less successful and
an alternative strategy has emerged, which is based on a non-econometric
("narrative") identi cation of the shifts in scal variables. These are then
plugged directly into an econometric speci cation capable of delivering the
impulse response functions that describe the output e¤ect of scal adjustments. In this narrative (Romer and Romer 2010) identi cation strategy
legislated tax and expenditure changes are classi ed into endogenous (induced by short-run countercyclical concerns) and exogenous (responses to
an inherited budget de cit, or to concerns about long-run economic growth
or politically motivated). In this paper we concentrate on scal measures
designed to deal with inherited budget de cits, therefore we concentrate on
the e¤ect of a subset of all exogenous adjustments.
Starting from narratively-identi ed shifts in scal variables we build scal
plans recognizing that such plans generate inter-temporal and intra-temporal
correlations among changes in spending and revenues. The inter-temporal
17

correlation is the one between the announced (future) and the unanticipated
(current) components of a plan  what we shall call the style" of a plan.
The intra-temporal correlation is that between the changes in revenues and
spending that determines the composition of a plan. As argued by Ramey
(2011a, b) distinguishing between announced and unanticipated shifts in scal variables, and allowing them to have di¤erent e¤ects on output, is crucial
for evaluating scal multipliers. This approach, rst introduced in AFG, is
an advance on the literature which so far had studied (see e.g. Mertens and
Ravn 2011) the di¤erent e¤ects of anticipated and unanticipated shifts in
scal variables assuming that they are orthogonal.
As discussed above, a scal plan is speci ed by making explicit the relation between the unpredictable component of the plan and the other two
components. In particular, with reference to a speci c country i, we consider:
eait;1 = '1i euit + v1;it
eai;t+1;0 = eait;1
The rst equation is a behavioral relation that captures the style with
which scal policy is implemented. Countries that typically implement permanent plans will feature a positive '1i , while temporary plans (in which
a country announces that an initial scal action will be reversed, at least
partially, in the future) will feature a negative '1i .
Our approach thus constructs the output response to a scal plan by
allowing for a di¤erent e¤ect between unanticipated and anticipated corrections, and by recognizing their interdependence within plans. Note that the
very nature of a plan makes shifts in scal variables predictable. Finally
within this framework we also allow for the infra-temporal correlations of
plans, that is for heterogeneous e¤ects of Tax-Based and Expenditure-Based
scal adjustments.
The scal plans studied in this paper are constructed expanding the data
put together, using the narrative method, by Devries et al (2011). These
authors, however, di¤er from us in that they opt for aggregation, summing
up anticipated and unanticipated components. Jordà and Taylor (2013) have
observed that such aggregated shifts in scal variables (hereafter referred to
as IMF shocks) are not exogenous, and therefore are not valid instruments
because they can be predicted using their own past (strongly), past values
of output growth (very weakly) and past values of debt dynamics (weakly).
We show in the Appendix that while aggregation undoubtedly generates
18

predictability, predictability is di¤erent form exogeneity. We also argue that
the restriction that the e¤ect on output of anticipated and unanticipated
corrections is the same is very strong, and that our proposed method, based
on the simulation of plans in which the correlation between anticipated and
anticipated corrections is measured and exploited in the constructions of the
relevant impulse response functions, is more exible.

4.2.1

The data
The pre-2009 data used in estimation

The AFG panel on which we run the within sample estimation includes 14
countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United
States.12 The frequency of the data is annual and the sample runs from 1978
to 2007.
In the Devries et al (2011) data, tax increases are measured as the expected revenue e¤ect of each change in the tax code as a percent of GDP of
the year the announcements made, whether it is implemented immediately
or announced for a later period. Spending cuts are measured as changes in
expenditure relative to the level that was expected absent the policy shift,
not relative to the previous year. This means that a spending cut for year
t + 1 does not necessarily imply a reduction in government spending relative
to year t, but only relative to what would have happened in year t + 1 absent any policy changes.13 Announcements are assumed to be fully credible.
A few measures that were announced but for which "the historical record
shows that they were not implemented at all" are dropped from the Devries
et al (2011) database. There are only ve instances in our sample in which
this happened  that is individual announcements were not recorded because
never implemented  one each in Japan, Italy, Germany, the UK and the
Netherlands (a case which is irrelevant for us since, as we discuss below, we
drop this country). In these cases we have not questioned the Devries et al
(2011) data call. All other announcements are assumed to be credible and
thus recorded.
12

Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands were dropped in the estimation in AFG. Euro
Area countries such as Greece and Cyprus were also excluded for lack of (reliable) data.
See that paper for more details.
13
The US "Sequester" of March 2013 is one example.

4.2.2

The data after 2009 used in out-of-sample simulations

In order to simulate the e¤ects of the scal consolidations implemented after
the strat of the nancial crisis we extended the Devries et al (2011) panel
following exactly the same methodology they employed. As discussed above
in Section 3, our new data cover 11 countries in the period 2009-2013. The
countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States. The total number of
years during which, in the various countries there has been an episode of
scal consolidation is 42 (see Table 3).

4.3

The estimated model

In order to measure the output e¤ect of scal consolidation plans, we estimate a multivariate system in which the output growth of each country is
projected on the three (exogenous) components of a scal plan. This reduced
form speci cation is a truncated moving average representation for output
growth where the only innovations included are the scal ones. Of course
we are omitting many other structural shocks relevant to explain output
growth. But under our identifying assumption, all omitted structural shocks
are orthogonal to those that we include in the regression.14
The estimated system (i denotes the country) is the following:
14

This assumption could be tested by adding to the model some variables as proxies for
the introduction of accompanying reforms potentially related to the narrative episodes.
By doing so we could check whether such reforms, rather than the character of the scal
plans, are what drives our estimates. AFG provide such a robustness check for labor
market reforms.

Per capita GDP growth in each country yi;t , is a¤ected by three di¤erent



approved and implemented in year t (unanticipated, eut );



shifts that had been announced in the past, but come into e¤ect
at time t (eat;0 );



announced at time t that will be implemented in the future. We
call these anticipated shifts in scal variables and consider a threeyear horizon (eat;j ). Three years is the average horizon of the scal plans
in our sample.

B(L) and C(L) polynomials are truncated after 3 years: they represent
the coe¢cients of the associated lagged variables from time t to t 3.15
The model is estimated by Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) imposing
cross-country restrictions on the coe¢cients in B, C and on the 0 s and
 0 s. We also include year and country xed-e¤ects. We gain in e¢ciency
on the estimates of B, C and on the 0 s and  0 s by pooling together the
data from several countries.16 We allow for the possibility of within country
15

This truncation does not generate any omitted variable distortion under the assumption that scal shocks do not a¤ect output for more than 3 years ahead. Indeed, since the
shocks at t-4 are correlated with those at t-3 and t-2 by construction, the omitted variable
bias is eliminated by assuming that they do not inuence our dependent variable.
16
The speci cation generalizes the MA representation estimated by Romer and Romer
(2010) allowing di¤erent coe¢cients on the unanticipated adjustments (announced at time

21

heterogeneity in the response of output growth to tax-based and spendingbased adjustments interacting overall scal shocks with TB and EB dummies.
Once the model is estimated we simulate the e¤ect of an unanticipated
shift in scal variables preserving the inter-temporal dimension of countryspeci c scal plans. That is, when we simulate the e¤ects on output growth
of an unanticipated shift, say in taxes, we recognize that a countrys typical
scal plan accompanies unanticipated shifts in taxes with the announcement
of future shifts in taxes and/or spending. We build such arti cial announcements adding to the estimated model the following country-speci c
additional equations:
eai;t;j = 'i;j eui;t + vi;t;j

j = 1; 2; 3

Where i refers to the country, t is the period and j=1,2,3 is the horizon
(limited to 3 years) of scal announcements. Allowing the '0 s to di¤er across
countries (i.e. allowing for countries to implement scal plans that are on
average di¤erent from one country to another) we introduce an additional
source of heterogeneity: between" countries heterogeneity which relates to
the style of scal plans, meaning the correlation between their unexpected
and announced components. The estimation of a countrys style allows us to
distinguish between countries that pursue consistent stabilization e¤orts over
time, countries with one-year horizon plans and nally countries in which the
'0ij s are negative, i.e. where announcements tend to overturn the e¤ects of
unanticipated shifts in policy.
In the speci cation illustrated above we interact overall scal shocks with
the TB and EB dummies, rather than introducing t and gt separately. We do
so because this version of the model is more suitable for simulating average
plans and for interpreting their results. The reason is that it avoids the
t and implemented at time t), on the anticipated correction currently implemented (announced before time t, and implemented at time t), and on the future corrections (announced at time t, to be implemented in the future). The possibility of di¤erent e¤ects of
announced, anticipated and unanticipated corrections is well grounded in the theoretical
literature and has already been introduced in empirical work (Mertens and Ravn 2011,
Perotti 2013). Our MA representation is augmented by a number of auxiliary equations
that capture the nature of the plan via the correlation between the unanticipated and
announced components of scal plans. As discussed in the text, to save on degrees of freedom we take into account the intra-temporal correlations between the revenue side and
the expenditure side of the adjustment interacting the total adjustment in the primary
surplus with TB or EB dummies.

22

problem of estimating the contemporaneous correlation between taxes and
spending measures. In other words, the introduction of t and gt directly
into the speci cation would require the estimation of a very large number of
'i;j parameters. This drawback does not apply to TB and EB corrections,
since by construction TB is equal to zero when EB is equal to one and
thus no interaction between these corrections need to be estimated. On
the other hand, the model with the TB and EB dummies may be sensitive
to the categorization of plans into EB and TB, especially when the share of
spending and taxes over the total consolidation is around 50%. Reassuringly,
the vast majority of the plans in our estimation and simulation samples are
far from a fty- fty split. In the estimation sample the share of spending
cuts in the average EB plan (in which the average total annual adjustment
is 1.36 of GDP) is 84 per cent, while in the case of TB plans (in which the
average total annual adjustment is 0.89 of GDP) such a share is 76 per cent.
In the simulation sample there are only 2 cases (over 42) where the share
of spending is between 49% and 51% of the total consolidation, and 8 cases
where the share is between 45% and 55%. In any event, in section 4.4.3 below
we present estimates of the model in which we introduce t and gt separately.
The results obtained introducing t and gt separately are qualitatively very
similar to the ones obtained with the benchmark model.
To sum up, the model can serve two di¤erent purposes. First, as in AFG,
we can estimate within-sample the output e¤ect of the average consolidation
plans occurred during the estimation period. In other words, we compute
impulse responses of output with respect to plans, in order to measure their
e¤ects. These impulse responses are computed as the di¤erence between
the simulated output growth conditional on the average EB and TB plan,
and the simulated output growth when no scal stabilization is implemented.
Second, once the model is estimated, we can run out-of-sample simulations of
speci c adjustment plans feeding directly into the model the announced and
realized components of a given plan  rather than using the estimated 'i;j
to simulate the average within-sample plan. This second exercise produces
projections of output growth conditional on the speci c scal plan studied.
Our speci cation uses a parsimonious representation to simulate the output e¤ect of scal plans. The same problem has been addressed using a
di¤erent methodology (the Local Projections Method) in Jordà and Taylor
(2013) and Jordà (2005). We illustrate and evaluate these two alternative approaches in the Appendix. The main di¤erence between the two is that Jordà
and Taylor deal econometrically with the di¤erent degree of predictability of
23

plans collapsed into exogenous single-period corrections, while our method
preserves the inter-temporal, multi-period aspect of scal adjustments and
trace the e¤ect on output of scal stabilizations that, despite being predictable, are exogenous with respect to the cycle.

4.4

Results

We organize the presentation of our empirical results in two sub-sections.
First, we describe the estimation and impulse response function corresponding to the average plan implemented during 1978-2007. We then concentrate
on the main contribution of the paper: the out-of-sample simulations of the
output e¤ect of the consolidation plans adopted after the crisis.
4.4.1

Output e¤ects of scal plans: pre-crisis (in-sample results)

Estimated coe¢cients for our model over the period 1976-2007 are reported in
Table 4. Note the negative sign on all signi cant TB (tax based) adjustments
implying that tax hikes have a negative and signi cant e¤ect on output.
The positive and in some cases statistically signi cant coe¢cients on the
EB (expenditure based) adjustments mean that spending cuts are correlated
with an increase in output (only one of the EB coe¢cients is negative and
then only marginally signi cant: the e¤ect of the implementation today of a
spending cut announced in the past).
We summarize the results reporting, in Figure 4, the response of output
to a one percent unexpected scal consolidation shock. We consider the effects of EB and TB adjustments separately (in blue and red, respectively).
When simulating an unexpected shock, we accompany it with arti cial
announcements of future policy shifts constructed using the estimated style
of each countrys plans (the '0ij s). Di¤erent styles depend on the typical
persistence of a shock, i.e. on the correlation between unexpected and anticipated shifts in scal variables within the average plan. For instance, in the
case of Ireland, scal plans are typically purely unexpected and contain no
announcements of future actions, while Italian plans are often reversed after
one year.17

17

Details about each countrys style of scal adjustment are provided in Table 5.

24

The results clearly show that scal consolidations implemented mainly by
raising taxes entail large output costs.18 AFG show that the component of
GDP which explains a large part of the di¤erence between EB and TB adjustments is private investment.19 In the next sub-section we explore whether
this feature of scal adjustments extends to the more recent period, i.e. to
the adjustments implemented over 2009-2013.
4.4.2

Output e¤ects of scal austerity in 2010-13

E¤ects of the plans adopted in 2009-13
The recent years o¤er an interesting opportunity to evaluate the predictions of our empirical model. There has been variability across countries and
across time in output growth during this period among the 11 countries in
our sample. It is thus interesting to compare the model projection of output
growth  conditional upon scal adjustment plans  with its observed path.
There are two questions we can attempt to answer: i) how much of the
recent recessions can be attributed to scal austerity; and ii) how much of the
heterogeneity in the severity of the crisis across countries can be explained
by the di¤erent styles of scal corrections. The reader should remember,
however, that the tool we are using is not a forecasting model. Our model
projects output growth conditional on scal shocks only, overlooking all other
structural factors that have a¤ected output growth in 2009-10. Overlooking
such factors does not a¤ect the validity of our estimates (as omitted variables
are orthogonal to those included in the speci cation) but it certainly a¤ects
the ability of our model to track the observed output growth.
We compute out-of sample simulations by feeding directly into our estimated model the actual plans adopted over the period 2009-2013. We assess
the e¤ects of a scal consolidation comparing the simulated path of output
growth, with the observed one. In Section 5.1 we shall discuss whether such
an out-of-sample simulation is valid testing for a regime change between in
sample estimates (up to 2007) and out-of-sample simulations (after 2009).
The results are supportive of our counterfactual exercise.20

The results of our simulations are presented in Figures 5, 6 and 7. On
the left hand side of each gure we plot a histogram describing the size and
composition of the scal adjustments happening in that year. Red columns
represent years of tax-based consolidations, while spending-based years are
colored in blue. In each histogram we report the yearly impact (unexpected
plus announced for time t) and the future announced shifts in scal variables,
measured as a fraction of GDP. The impact is represented by the full-colored
columns, while announcements correspond to the cross-hatched columns of
each gure. On the right hand side panels we report:
- the actual GDP growth (in black);21
- the simulated GDP growth conditional on the implemented scal plan
(in green with 64% con dence intervals);
- what output growth would have been, according to the model, had the
plan been totally expenditure-based (blue line with squared symbols);
- what output growth would have been, according to the model, had the
plan been totally tax-based (red line with circles).
In countries like Germany, Spain or the US, where the plans actually
implemented were almost totally expenditure-based, the green and blue lines
virtually coincide.
Our model matches the realized growth paths quite well, especially for
those countries, such as Italy, where scal shocks were the main determinants
of GDP growth. However, several caveats are in order.
First, as we already repeated a number of times, our model projects GDP
growth only conditional upon scal consolidations. Therefore, we should expect a closer t between actual and projected GDP growth in years during
which there were no other signi cant shocks (e.g. economic, political, etc.).
The evidence from 2012 and 2013 illustrates this point, as these years are
more distant from the nancial and economic shocks of 2008 and 2009. There
are also a few speci c non- nancial shocks that could explain why predictions
do not match actual growth. The most relevant ones occurred in Portugal
in 2010 and in Germany in the years closer to the crisis. For Portugal our
predicted growth rate for 2010 is considerably lower than realized growth.
One possible reason is stated in the EU Council Recommendation (with a
in the response to TB and EB plans. Di¤erently, the responses of term spreads do not
feature a signi cant asymmetry. This result is consistent with the evidence in Alesina and
Ardagna (2010).

In the case of Ireland we also ran simulations for GNP, instead of GDP, and the results

view to bringing an end to the situation of an excessive government de cit in
Portugal) (p. 5), which claims that in 2010 positive growth of 1:4% was
largely due to exceptional factors that boosted exports and private consumption. In Germany, our projected growth rate is almost at, which is distant
from the growth rates realized right after the crisis. The IMF claimed that
the [German] uptick started in the second quarter of 2009, led by exports and
aided by policy support and restocking of inventories.22 Not surprisingly, the
model cannot account for export-led growth. In general, given the features
of our model, it is reasonable to expect a better t in countries subject to impressive amounts of scal adjustment because these shocks were more likely
to dominate other shocks.
Second, note that in some countries like Ireland, Spain and the US, the
model projections and the actual growth rate are set at di¤erent levels, especially when the scal adjustments are small. These are the countries where
the average GDP growth before the crisis was signi cantly di¤erent (higher)
from the one after the crisis. Remember that the model is estimated including
a country xed-e¤ect, which is the average GDP per capita growth over the
years 1978-2007 (net of scal shocks) and represents a counterfactual growth
in absence of scal shocks. Since the model simulations assume that scal
policy a¤ects GDP only relatively to the level of the xed-e¤ect, this may
lead to an overestimation of growth, especially when the scal adjustment is
small, and for countries that in the post crisis years could not catch up with
their per-capita growth rates in the 80s and 90s.
Conversely, as shown in Table 6, the projected growth for Ireland, Italy,
Portugal and Spain show that the di¤erent nature of the scal adjustments
contributes signi cantly in explaining growth di¤erentials among these countries.
[INSERT TABLE 6]
The results con rm that EB adjustments have been much less costly
than TB ones. Compare for example Ireland and Italy. The former had
a draconian adjustment on the expenditure side and a small recession in
2010-13 after the disastrous banking collapse of 2009. Italy had a smaller
adjustment but virtually all on the revenue side, at least up to 2013. The

result (in Italy) was a deep recession which is still ongoing. Portugal and
Spain also feature a good match between observed output growth and that
projected on the basis of predominantly expenditure based scal adjustments.
Note that in the case of Spain the burst of the housing bubble contributed
to the recession and high unemployment above and beyond the e¤ects of
the scal adjustments. In fact, even though the Portuguese and Spanish
governments implemented some of the largest consolidations of the whole
sample, most of them were through spending cuts and the e¤ect on GDP
was low compared to the amount of de cit reduction implemented. The UK
had a moderate EB adjustment and a small and short-lived recession. France
had a moderate and mixed type of adjustment, and a moderate recession.
The size of the 64% con dence bounds on our out-of sample simulations
di¤er across countries.23 There are two reasons for this. First, the uncertainty
of the xed e¤ect, which captures the equilibrium rate of output growth in
the absence of shocks, di¤ers signi cantly across countries. Second, some
plans may include elements (for example two-year-ahead announcements)
whose e¤ects are less precisely estimated: this makes the uncertainty of the
simulation dependent on the style of a plan. As a result in some cases, such as
Italy, con dence intervals are relatively narrow; in other, such as Germany
or Ireland, they are much larger. In the case of Italy the plans adopted
over 2010-13 include components whose coe¢cients were precisely estimated.
Moreover, Italy has a small standard error associated with its xed-e¤ect.
The German plans of 2010-13, instead, typically contained components (for
example two-year ahead announcements of a spending cut) not as precisely
estimated and a high standard error on the xed-e¤ect. In the case of Ireland,
the signi cant size of each adjustment exacerbates the large standard error
on the coe¢cients on unexpected EB shocks. Moreover, Ireland displays the
largest standard error on the xed-e¤ect among all countries in the sample.
Counterfactuals
Turning now to the counterfactual results (the red and blue lines respectively on the right-hand-side panels) notice that in countries like Spain,
Italy, Ireland and Portugal, which implemented the largest scal consolidations (and where the model predictions best t the actual growth), the nature
23

Con dence bounds di¤er also compared to the impulse response functions presented
in Section 4.4.1. The main reason is the inclusion of the country xed-e¤ects uncertainty
in the out-of sample simulations. Secondly, impulse response analysis is based on the
simulation of the average plan in which several adjustment plans are pooled together,
while out of sample projections consider instead a speci c plan.

28

of the scal plans plays a prominent role in determining the growth experience. For example, if Spain had implemented exactly the same adjustment
but had chosen to mostly raise taxes, instead of cutting expenditures, its
GDP growth would have been about 5 percent lower in 2013. On the other
hand, had Italy chosen to mostly cut expenditures rather than raise taxes,
its GDP growth would have been 2 percent higher in every single year since
2011, with a cumulative additional 6 percent points of growth.
Finally, notice that, as anticipated above, the model does not succeed in
projecting growth in countries where the scal consolidation e¤ort was small,
since other shocks probably dominated. Hence in Germany or the US, given
the small magnitude of the adjustments implemented, it does not make a big
di¤erence whether the plans were predominantly TB or EB.

4.4.3

Robustness of the EB and TB dummy de nitions

In the speci cation used so far scal shocks where interacted with the TB
and EB dummies. As discussed above this speci cation may be sensitive
to the categorization of plans into EB and TB. As a robustness check we
run our model with a di¤erent speci cation in which we introduce t and
gt separately. That is we do not label scal adjustments as TB and EB
but we simply use in the regressions the actual announced and unexpected
tax hikes and spending cuts. We discussed above the pros and cons and this
approach relative to our previous speci cation based upon a classi cation of
plans in EB and TB. One advantage of this approach is to avoid potential
mis-speci cations in cases where the allocation of spending cuts and tax
increases is close to fty- fty  a case, as we discussed above, that almost
never happens in our samples. This alternative speci cation is

The estimated coe¢cients are shown in Table 7 and are qualitatively very
similar to the ones obtained with the benchmark model. The coe¢cients on
29

taxes, when signi cant, are all negative, the coe¢cient on spending, when
signi cant (which happens only marginally for one of them) are positive.
Note however that inferring the response of output growth to taxes and
expenditure from these coe¢cients only is warranted in the case tax and
expenditure adjustments are orthogonal to each other, a condition that it not
usually satis ed. Figures 8, 9 and 10 reproduce, using the new speci cation,
the results shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7. The new results are consistent with
those obtained using the EB/TB dummies. For some countries, such as Spain
and Portugal, the model above delivers projections closer to realized GDP
growth than those in our baseline speci cation.

Were the recent
cially costly?

scal adjustments espe-

The recent episodes of austerity happened under special conditions. They
followed the Great Recession (in fact they started during its tail end) and the
nancial crisis, which led to credit crunches. In most cases market conditions
forced European countries to start de cit reduction polices when the recession
was not yet over and nancial markets were still experiencing a credit crunch.
In addition, many countries implemented scal contractions at the same time.
All of these factors might suggest that the recent scal consolidations might
have been more costly than those of previous decades.24 Blanchard and Leigh
(2013) argue that this was indeed the case. We investigate their nding
that, in the recent round of scal adjustments, scal multipliers were larger
than anticipated and we nd that the evidence in favor of a change in scal
multipliers is very weak.
In addressing this question it is important to distinguish between two
possibilities. One is that scal multipliers were larger in these recent rounds
of scal adjustments than estimated using pre-crisis data: this is the question
asked by Blanchard and Leigh (2013). The other is that scal multipliers
were not di¤erent but additional shocks (like credit crunches for instance)
24

All of these factors were outlined (among others) by Christiano, Eichenbaum and
Rebelo (2011), Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012),
OECD (2014b).

created deep recessions regardless of the size of scal multipliers. Within the
framework of this paper we can only investigate the rst of these questions.
We begin by testing whether our model implies a regime change between
in-sample estimates (up to 2007) and out-of-sample simulations, after 2009.

5.1
5.1.1

Testing for a Regime Change
Test on joint equality of coe¢cients

We rst test for the joint stability of our parameter estimates between the two
samples 1981-2007 and 2008-2013. In order to run the test we interact each
of the 20 coe¢cients measuring the output e¤ects of shifts in scal variables
with a time dummy taking the value of 1 after 2008.25 The joint signi cance
of each of these stability parameters is evaluated using the Wald test.
The hypothesis of structural stability is not rejected with alpha = 0:01
but rejected with alpha = 0:05. Hence we are at the margin of structural
instability. However, the Wald test for the joint signi cance of so many
parameters could be driven by transitory movement in just a single parameter. This is indeed the case since when we drop the coe¢cient for eat 3;0
from the test we do not reject stability even with alpha = 0:1. As a consequence, we consider the estimates obtained using pre-crisis data to give
valuable information about the amount of output loss due to the post-crisis
scal consolidation measures. An additional caveat is that we are looking at
a structural break rather close to the end of the sample, thus with very few
observations after the break, which makes the test less precise.
5.1.2

Changing the estimation sample

To further support this point, we next provide a visual comparison (with
con dence intervals) between the simulations produced using parameters estimated in the two samples: 1980-2007 and 1980-2013.
To do this, we re-estimate our model over the extended sample (19792013) and we then use the new estimated coe¢cients to simulate GDP growth
inputting post-crisis shocks. Figure 11 plots the predicted growth rates using
the new estimates (orange) against those computed in the previous section
(Figures 5, 6 and 7) (green). The new projections track actual GDP growth
25

Our test can be thought of as a version of the Chow Test that allows for the presence
of country xed e¤ects in the panel data.

within-sample estimation.

5.2

Did Fiscal Multipliers Change After the Crisis?

Blanchard and Leigh (2013, hereafter BL) address the stability of scal multipliers using a di¤erent approach. They investigate the relation between the
IMF growth forecast errors and the total amount of scal consolidations expected to be implemented in 2011, based on IMF forecasts. In practice, they
run an OLS regression on a cross-section of 27 advanced economies employing a cyclically adjusted measure of changes in the structural budget balance.
They nd that stronger planned scal consolidation has been associated with
lower growth than expected, with the relation being particularly strong, both
statistically and economically, early in the crisis. Their results suggest that
for every additional percentage point of GDP of scal consolidation, GDP
was about 1 percent lower than forecasted. They interpret the result as implying that scal multipliers in 2011 were higher than those predicted by
forecasters.26
In order to assess this evidence it is important to realize that the forecast errors constructed in BL are conditional upon a scenario for all the
exogenous variables that enter the IMF forecasting model. Their forecast
errors could therefore reect surprises in such scenario and in the response
of all endogenous variables to such surprises. Our approach instead delivers
a projection of GDP growth conditional only on the scal adjustment. As a
consequence, a regression of the residuals of our model  produced by projecting GDP growth only on the announced scal adjustment  run on the
scal adjustment itself, can provide more direct evidence on the potential
structural instability of scal multipliers.
To illustrate this point, we run the following regression
yit+i

E [yit+i jeit ; T Bt ; EBt ] =

26

+ eit + "it

BL investigate the robustness of their results replacing IMF forecasts with those of
other forecasters: the EC, the OECD, and the EIU. They nd that their results are robust.
These alternative forecast, however, su¤er of the same weakness we have pointed out for
IMF forecasts.

32

The dependent variable is the discrepancy between the actual growth
rate and the growth rate projected by our model, and eit is the narrative
measure of the de cit-driven scal consolidation actions (unexpected and
announced). The model projections allow for a di¤erent impact on growth of
TB and EB plans, therefore the nature of the plan is an important element
of the conditioning information set.
If scal multipliers are stable, the estimated coe¢cient linking the real
growth projection error and our narrative measure of scal episodes ( )
should be centered on zero.
Notice the di¤erence with the BL speci cation. In the BL speci cation
the forecast error is the di¤erence between realized growth and growth as
predicted by the IMF forecasting model thus is conditional on all the exogenous variables forming the scenario of such model, not only scal variables,
moreover no di¤erence between TB and EB plans is allowed in this speci cation.
We rst estimate the model using OLS and restricting the sample to
the cumulated forecast errors in 2010-2011, in order to exactly replicate BL.
Results are reported in Table 8. The estimate of (0:243) is small, not significantly di¤erent from zero, and about one third of the value estimated in BL.
Extending the estimation period to include the observations in 2010-13 the
magnitude of the estimated coe¢cient does not change but is now signi cant
at the 1% level (column 2). In other words, for each additional percentage
point of scal consolidation after the nancial crisis, GDP turned out to be
0:4 percent lower than accounted by our model, a value only marginally signi cant. However, introducing country- xed e¤ects the coe¢cient becomes
again insigni cant while not changing in magnitude (column 3). Results are
robust to the inclusion of the sum of scal announcements in the speci cation (column 4). Summing up, our results suggest, di¤erently from BL, that
probably only minor or no changes in the scal multiplier have occurred after
the crisis.
[INSERT TABLE 8]
The di¤erence of our results with respect to the ones in BL might be due
to many factors. First, as we said, our structural break test uses a model
conditional only on scal policy with heterogeneous e¤ect of EB and TB
plans, and not conditional on the whole information set of IMF forecasters.
Second, if the composition of the scal adjustments post 2010 di¤ered from
33

the average composition in the past, this could explain why models that
impose identical e¤ects of TB and EB adjustments, such as the IMF forecasts,
nd a break in the estimated multiplier.27 Finally, there are fewer countries
in our sample, compared to that of BL.

Conclusions

The conventional wisdom is (i) that scal austerity was the main culprit for
the recessions experienced by many countries, especially in Europe and (ii)
that this round of scal consolidation was much more costly than the past
ones. The contribution of this paper is a clari cation of the rst point and,
if not a clear rejection, at least it raises doubts on the second.
On the rst point our main nding is that, as in the past, in the recent episodes there has been a very big di¤erence between tax-based and
expenditure-based scal adjustments. The former have indeed been very
costly in terms of output losses. The latter much less so. These results are
very similar to those obtained by many authors who have studied the e¤ects
of scal adjustments preceding the period 2010-2013. Comparing our results
on these recent adjustments and the ones obtained using pre-crisis data  that
is up to 2007  we did not nd strong evidence against the hypothesis that
scal multipliers large tax multipliers and very small spending multipliers
 were stable across the two sub-samples.
Our results, however, are mute on the question whether the countries we
have studied did the right thing implementing scal austerity at the time
they did, that is 2009-13. Consolidations, as illustrated in Figure 2 at the
beginning of the paper, all happened at the trough of a recession, which
normally is not a good time to adopt scal restraint. However the surge in
interest rates on public debt on the European periphery might have fueled
dangerous debt crisis. In some countries, such as Spain, Ireland and Portugal,
27

To investigate whether their baseline results are driven primarily by spending cuts or
by revenue increases, BL split their measure of scal consolidation  the change in the
cyclically-adjusted scal balance  into the change in government spending and revenue
and estimate the model separating between the change in spending and the change in
revenue. They nd that overall scal multipliers were, on average, underestimated for both
sides of the scal balance, with a slightly larger degree of underestimation associated with
changes in government spending. Once again, however, it is impossible to separate, within
this framework, between overall forecast errors and forecast errors signaling a change in
scal multipliers.

34

scal consolidations have been accompanied, at least in 2012-13, by other
(non scal) shocks to the economy that have depressed output growth, raising
the question of whether the intensity of the scal contraction was optimal.
This is an important question, but one that, within the framework adopted
in this paper, we cannot answer. We would need a structural model capable
of tracking the e¤ect of several shocks.
In order to obtain these results we constructed a detailed narrative
data set which documents the actual size and composition of the scal plans
of several countries in the period 2009-2013. The plans are composed of
preannounced and unexpected policy changes often with many revisions in
mid-course, which incidentally added much uncertainty in expectations, an
uncertainty which may have had negative e¤ects on investments. Thus, an
additional contribution of this paper is a clari cation of these complex dynamic evolutions and the construction of a new narrative data set on recent
scal adjustments. We have then estimated the output e¤ects of these scal
plans simulating out-of-sample a model that allows for anticipated and unanticipated shifts in scal variables, as well as for di¤erences in the response of
output to tax and spending changes.
Two criticisms could be raised to our analysis. First, our out-of-sample
simulations are constructed under the assumption that scal multipliers did
not change during the nancial crisis, when monetary policy hit the zero
lower bound. When we test explicitly the hypothesis that recent scal adjustments had the same e¤ect on output growth as past ones, we nd it hard
to reject the null, although in some cases failure to reject is marginal. This
result appears inconsistent with some recent empirical ndings (discussed in
the paper) where the costs of scal adjustments are found to be higher in
recent years. One reason for this di¤erence is the assumption  made in most
studies of scal multipliers, but relaxed in this paper  that tax and spending
multipliers are identical, and thus that one can estimate the output e¤ects
of a scal consolidation. If, as the data strongly suggest, scal multipliers
depend on the composition of a scal correction, imposing that the e¤ects
of tax-based and spending-based consolidations are identical will result in
distorted estimates of the multiplier. Such distortion will depend on the
composition of the average scal adjustment which occurred over the estimation sample. If the composition of the scal adjustments post-2007 di¤ered
from the average composition in the past, this could explain why models that
impose identical e¤ects of tax-based and spending-based consolidations nd
a break in the estimated multiplier.
35

The second, and in this case warranted, criticism is our failure to consider
accompanying policies and to ask whether countries that accompanied scal austerity with structural reforms experienced better output growth than
countries which did not. As noted in the introduction, and as documented
in Alesina and Ardagna (2010, 2013) and Perotti (2013), multi-year scal
adjustments rarely occur in isolation. They are often accompanied by other
policies (a devaluation, a labor market reform or a pension reform) and their
e¤ects will vary depending on these policies. These policy packages have
in the past delivered cases of expansionary scal consolidations in which
countries have managed to avoid any recessionary cost of scal contractions.
In the current rounds of adjustments, except for the few pension reforms
which we documented (with bene ts accruing with several years of delay)
and of the Spanish labor market reform, the scal corrections of 2010-13
were mostly implemented in a rush under market pressure and governments
rarely had the time to design and get Parliaments to approve signi cant reforms. For instance, only in 2014 did Italy implement a major labor market
reform in the context of a pro-growth medium term package. More research
is warranted on this point.

APPENDIX: Plans and the Measurement
of their E¤ects of Output

The scal plans studied in the paper are constructed expanding the data put
together, using the narrative method, by Devries et al (2011). Jordà and
Taylor (2013) have argued that the episodes of scal consolidation identi ed
by Devries et al (hereafter referred to as IMF corrections) are not exogenous,
and thus are not valid instruments because they can be predicted using their
own past (strongly), past values of output growth (very weakly) and past
values of debt dynamics (weakly). Some discussion of this point is in order.
Consider our description of scal adjustment plans
f(i;t) =euit +eait;0 +eait;1
eait;1 ='1i euit +v1;i;t
eait;0 =eait;1
fi;t , the narrative exogenous scal adjustment in each year, includes three
components: the unexpected adjustments (announced upon implementation
at time t), the past announced adjustments (implemented at time t but
announced in the previous years) and the future announced corrections (considering, for simplicity, the case in which the horizon of the plan is only one
year these corrections are announced at time t for implementation at time
t + 1).

Given an initial shock to eit , the e¤ects of a scal plan are simulated by
using a moving average representation of output growth that projects it on
each of the three types of scal action, supplemented by the set of equations

Importantly, euit are not predictable by their past and are not correlated
with the cycle. But since euit are identi ed via the narrative method  selecting
scal adjustments designed to o¤set the expansionary changes in government
spending occurred in the past  they are predictable by past changes in
government debt.
Exogeneity, however, is di¤erent form predictability. Consider, for the
sake of illustration, this simple representation
yi;t =

The condition required for euit to be weakly exogenous for the estimation
of is 1;2 = 0, which is independent of  = 0: when 1;2 = 0 and  is
di¤erent from zero euit is predictable but exogenous for the estimation of .
To sum up, our methodology is based on a truncated MA representation
where plans take care of most of the predictability of the IMF corrections.
Some predictability is present in our corrections  because the consolidation
episodes selected are those designed to o¤set an expansionary increase in
government spending happened in the past  but this predictability does not
a¤ect the consistency of our estimates of the output e¤ect of scal adjustment
plans.
Jordà and Taylor (2013), choose a di¤erent route to address the preF
corrections, by taking the following three steps
dictability of the eIM

innovations as a 0=1 dummy variable;

i;t



estimate a propensity score deriving the probability with which a
correction is expected by regressing it on its own past and predictors;



use the propensity score to derive an Average Treatment E¤ect
based on Inverse Probability Weighting.

This method has the advantage of taking the simulation of the output
e¤ect of scal adjustments closer to a quasi-natural experiment. This reF
sult, however, comes at some cost. First, replacing eIM
innovations with a
i;t
0=1 dummy disregards relevant information on the intensity of the adjustment. Second, the links between the announced and anticipated part of a
stabilization plan are lost. Third, the presence of the forward looking component  which is omitted from the speci cation  might introduce a bias in the
local-projections-computed impulse responses whenever there is a systematic
relation between the forward looking component and the unexpected component of the adjustment. Fourth, the heterogeneity of scal plans across
countries is lost when they are assimilated to the same common treatment
administered to many patients".

Figure 1: Fiscal Policy in Media

The extent to which fiscal policy was debated in media is measured through the share of articles
concerning fiscal policy over the total number of published articles. Data are monthly and the
plotted series is a 5-year centered moving average of the measure in our sample. Numbers along
vertical axis are the percentage over total articles published. Using the archive Factiva we searched
for keywords connected to fiscal policy and debt: “austerity”, “fiscal consolidation”, “fiscal compact”, “Maastricht”, “excessive deficit procedure”, “public debt”, “fiscal policy”, “budget deficit”
and “debt crisis”. We collect monthly data for the countries in our sample from January 2006
to January 2014. We normalize the absolute number of articles dividing by the total number of
published articles, measured by searching the most common word for each country (e.g. “the” for
English-speaking countries). We select the first five national newspapers for circulation in every
country excluding sport newspapers, free newspapers and tabloids.

Figure 2: Extent of Pro-cyclical polices in Advanced Economies during and after the financial crisis

We plot the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance against the output gap registered in the same
year. A negative (positive) change in the primary balance means that the cyclically adjusted deficit is increasing
(decreasing). As a consequence, years of countercyclical fiscal policy are those in the first and third quadrants,
while years of procyclical policies lie in the second and fourth quadrants. Source: OECD Forecasting, Analysis and
Modeling Environment.

narrative consolidation episodes are our extension of Devries et al. (2011) data.
