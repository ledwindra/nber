    "abstract": "\n\nA set of randomized experiments shed light on how markets and information influence household decisions to adopt nutritional innovations. Of 400 Indian villages, we randomly assigned half to an intervention where all shopkeepers were offered the option to sell a new salt, fortified with both iron and iodine (and not just iodine) at 50% discount. Within treatment villages, we conducted additional interventions: an increase in retailer margin (for one or several shopkeepers), the screening of an \u201cedutainment\u201d movie on the benefits of double-fortified salt, a flyer informing households of the product\u2019s availability, and free distribution to a subset of households. We find that two interventions \u2013 showing the short film and offering an incentive to all shopkeepers \u2013 significantly increased usage: both by 5.5 percentage points, or over 50%, over take up without intervention, three years after launch. For comparison, only about half of households given the salt for free actually consumed it.\n\n",
