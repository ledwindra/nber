The Return to Work and Women’s Employment Decisions

NBER Working Paper No. 24429

ABSTRACT
It is well documented that individuals in couples tend to retire around the same time. But because
women tend to marry older men, this means many married women retire at younger ages than
their husbands. This fact is somewhat at odds with lifecycle theory that suggests women might
otherwise retire at later ages than men because they have longer life expectancies, and often have
had shorter careers on account of childrearing. As a result, the opportunity cost of retirement—in
terms of foregone potential earnings and accruals to Social Security wealth—may be larger for
married women than for their husbands. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I find
evidence that the returns to additional work beyond mid-life are greater for married women than
for married men. The potential gain in Social Security wealth alone is enough to place married
women on nearly equal footing with married men in terms of Social Security wealth at age 70.

Husbands and wives tend to retire around the same time within couples. But because
women tend to marry men older than they, the joint retirement of married couples means
that married women retire at younger ages than their husbands do. This difference in age
at retirement seems counterintuitive since women have longer life expectancies and have
shorter careers due to delayed or interrupted labor force participation while raising
children.1 Thus, they should optimally retire at older ages than men.
The observation that husbands and wives tend to retire at the same time, even when
they greatly differ in age, has been noted in several different data sets for the U.S. and
across different cohorts (e.g., Blau, 1998; Coile, 2004; Gustman and Steinmeier, 2000, 2004,
2014; Hurd, 1990; Maestas, 2001; Michaud and Vermuelen, 2011; Schirle, 2008). Evidence
of coordinated retirement behavior has also been documented in Canada (Baker, 2002;
Schirle, 2008), in England (Banks, Blundell and Casanova, 2010; Schirle, 2008), and in
continental Europe (Honoré and De Paula, 2015).
Certainly, some degree of retirement coordination between married partners is
expected, if for no other reason than because husbands and wives share a budget set. For
example, married women with greater wealth might individually choose to consume more
leisure by retiring earlier, and so might their husbands, who share the same assets.
Married couples may also have similar, or even directly linked, pension incentives (e.g.,
Social Security spousal benefits) that make possible retirement around the same time.
Nonetheless, the dominant explanation for joint retirement may not even arise through the

cohort.

budget set, but through common preferences for joint leisure (Gustman and Steinmeier
2000, 2004; Maestas, 2001; Michaud and Vermuelen, 2011). In other words, spouses value
each other’s company and leisure complementarity leads them to retire around the same
time.
Despite the utility benefits of joint leisure, the relatively younger retirement of
married women may be costly for at least two reasons. First, with delayed or discontinuous
labor force participation, married women may experience their peak earnings years just as
they retire. Their husbands, on the other hand, may be past their peak earnings years, both
on account of being older and having had relatively continuous labor force participation. As
such, married women may forego earnings opportunities that could both increase their
Social Security benefit entitlements 2 and increase private household net worth3 through
additional saving. Second, married women tend to retire before age 65, when they would
be eligible for Medicare, and they therefore face the additional cost of purchasing health
insurance from the time they retire until they turn 65. Even those with employersubsidized retiree health benefits may face significantly greater costs for health insurance
before age 65 than after. Unless married couples compensate by increasing other assets,
women’s younger retirement may result in lower resources during the couples’ remaining
life together, and during any subsequent divorce or widowhood.
We know significantly less about the retirement behavior of women than we do about
men, and virtually no research attention has been devoted to considering the implications

of the fact that women retire at younger ages than men do. Even if married men fully
compensate for the relatively younger retirement of their wives by working longer than
they otherwise would, or if the Social Security benefit formulas fully compensate women
through spousal and survivor benefits, married women may nevertheless forego the
opportunity to accrue significant pension assets in their own names. Theories of household
decision-making posit that asset and income ownership determines control over household
consumption (see e.g., Browning and Chiappori, 1998; Lundberg and Pollak, 1993; Maestas,
2001). It is thus plausible that owning assets may give older women greater control over
their allocation between the couple’s joint lifetime and her expected years of survivorship.
I investigate the shape of the age-earnings profile for middle-aged and older married
women to assess whether the return to continued work is larger for married women than
for married men. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I document the changing
patterns of employment at older ages among married women and married men, and
establish the cross-spouse correlation in baseline work intentions and the likelihood of
early retirement. I then estimate the shape of the age-earnings profile for married women,
as compared to married men. Finally, I examine how continued work would affect the
individual Social Security wealth of married women compared with married men, as well
as the household-level Social Security wealth (which additionally accounts for the expected
present value of spouse and survivor benefit entitlements).
Five key findings emerge from this study. First, preferences for joint leisure persist
among married women and men in recent cohorts, suggesting that the tradeoff between
the potential return to continued work and preferences for joint leisure continues to be
salient for couples. Second, married women in the boomer cohorts enter their fifties
-4-

earning substantially more than their predecessors, and the growth across cohorts has
been three times as great for married women than for married men. Third, estimates of the
shapes of the age-earnings profiles indicate that the return to additional years of work is
relatively larger for married women than for married men. Fourth, working until age 70,
that is beyond the Social Security Early and Full Retirement Ages, would make a sizable
increase in the magnitude of lifetime Social Security benefits to which married women are
entitled. The gain in years worked at older ages would be sufficient to offset early gaps in
their earnings records and would place women on par with men in terms of lifetime
benefits. Finally, I find that individuals with the largest potential gains in Social Security
wealth are just as likely to retire early as those with the least to gain. This suggests that
individuals do not factor these potential gains into their employment decisions, and it
raises the question of whether individuals are able to correctly assess the opportunity costs
associated with reducing work effort before age 70.

Data and Summary Statistics

A. Data
I use the 1992 to 2012 waves of the nationally representative Health and Retirement
Study (HRS).4 The cohort structure of the HRS allows one to compare cohorts at the same
ages but across different years. I use the four birth cohort groups that enter the survey at
ages 51 to 56. The Original HRS cohort (b. 1931 to 1941) entered the survey in 1992 at
ages 51 to 61, and has been observed in biennial interviews for 20 years. For age-

Volume).

comparability with the other HRS cohorts, I use the younger members who were ages 51 to
56 in 1992 and label this group the HRS-Late cohort (b. 1936 to 1941). The War Babies
cohort (b. 1942 to 1947) entered the survey in 1998 at ages 51 to 56 and has been
observed for 14 years. The Early Baby Boom (b. 1948 to 1953) entered at ages 51 to 56 in
2004 and has been observed for eight years, and the Mid Baby Boom (b. 1954 to 1959)
entered at ages 51 to 56 in 2010 and has been observed for two years. To increase
statistical precision, I group the two “early cohorts” (HRS-Late and War Babies) and
contrast them with the two “boomer cohorts” (Early Baby Boom and Mid Baby Boom).
In the analyses that follow, I compare employment and earnings outcomes for
married women and married men, by cohort. The HRS enrolls age-eligible respondents and
their spouses. Some spouses are themselves age-eligible for a cohort and are enrolled as
primary respondents. As a result of this recruitment structure, in any contrast between
married women and married men, most of the married women and men (though not all)
are married to each other. I assign each respondent their marital status as of the baseline
survey wave; that is, as of ages 51 to 56. I use the RAND HRS Data, Version O (Chien et al.,
2015).
B. Summary Statistics: Demographics and Labor Supply at Baseline
Table 1 presents cross-sectional summary statistics for married women and married
men in the early cohorts compared to the boomer cohorts. As intended given the cohort
structure of the analysis sample, the average age of respondents in each group is 53 years
old. In line with national trends, the percent of married women with a college degree has
risen substantially, from 19 percent in the early cohorts to 32 percent in the boomer

-6-

cohorts. Among married men, the percent with a college degree has risen from 28 percent
in the early cohorts to 35 percent in the boomer cohorts. Reflecting demographic trends in
the U.S. population, the boomer cohorts are more ethnically diverse than earlier cohorts.
The boomer cohorts are slightly more likely to report “fair” or “poor” health than the
earlier cohorts, particularly married men. Household wealth (measured as net worth) is
substantially greater among the boomers compared to the early cohorts.
Table 1 also presents several measures of labor supply, all assessed at the baseline
survey wave for each cohort (and therefore holding age constant). The employment rate of
married women (at ages 51 to 56) has risen from 64 percent in the early cohorts to 68
percent in the boomer cohorts. In contrast, the employment rate of married men (at the
same ages) has declined across cohorts, from 84 to 79 percent. The lifetime number of
years worked by married women (as of their early fifties) has risen from a mean of 23
years in the early cohorts to 24 years in the boomer cohorts.5 The lifetime number of years
worked by married men is higher, but has declined by five years—from 33 years (early
cohorts) to 28 years (boomer cohorts). Baseline annual earnings (conditional on either fullor part-time employment and expressed in real 2012 dollars) are 31 percent higher among
the boomer women ($44,220) compared to married women in earlier cohorts ($33,787).
This compares with cross-cohort growth in annual earnings of 10 percent among boomer
men ($73,591) compared to married men in earlier cohorts ($66,927). The implied hourly

5

The lifetime number of years worked was constructed by the RAND HRS from a series of questions
recording respondents’ self-reported labor force history (Chien et al., 2015). The slight increase in mean
years of work masks pronounced changes at the tails of the distribution. Goldin and Katz (This Volume,
Figures 7-8) show that the share of women in the labor force 80 to 100 percent of the time when they
were ages 25 to 54 rose from 20 percent to more than 50 percent across cohorts, while the fraction in the
labor force only 20 percent of the time or less declined.

wage grew by similar percentages across the cohort groups (26 percent for married
women and 18 percent for married men), while hours worked per week and weeks worked
per year were the same for both women and men. Thus, the earnings growth across
cohorts appears to reflect a change in real wages for married women—perhaps as more of
them have attained a college degree—and not simply growth in hours worked. Nor does it
appear to reflect longer tenure in the job held at baseline. Mean job tenure for married
women at baseline was 11.4 years in both the early and boomer cohorts. Mean job tenure
among married men at the same ages fell by one year across cohorts—from 15 years (early
cohorts) to 14 years (boomer cohorts).
II.

Employment Patterns of Married Women and Married Men

A. Cohort Comparisons of Employment by Age
I next examine the full-time employment rate of married women by age and across
cohorts, in comparison with married men. For this analysis, the underlying data are
organized in longitudinal format, and the panel is unbalanced to create a semi-synthetic
age profile. A respondent first observed at age 51 contributes additional observations at
53, 55, and so forth. A respondent first observed at age 52 contributes additional
observations at 54, 56, and so forth. The data for the Mid Baby Boom cohort are largely
cross-sectional since this cohort is only observed twice; the oldest member of the Mid Baby
Boom at baseline is only 58 by their second interview in 2012.

-8-

Figure 1 shows that the full-time employment rate among married women in the
boomer cohorts is higher than in the earlier cohorts at every age (from 51 to 64).6 The fulltime employment rate for married men is higher than for women at all ages, but in
contrast, the married men in the boomer cohorts are less likely to be employed full-time
than men in the early cohorts until about age 58—this pattern is driven by the Mid Baby
Boom who experienced weaker employment conditions in the aftermath of the Great
Recession than did earlier cohorts at those ages.
Figure 2 shows the age profiles in part-time employment. Among married women,
the age profile in part-time employment is relatively flat with age (in the neighborhood of
20 percent) and perhaps somewhat higher among boomer women in their late fifties. In
contrast, part-time employment among married men rises with age, so that by their midsixties, the part-time employment rate is similar for married men and women.
B. Labor Supply Correlations across Spouses
In Table 2, I document the labor supply patterns of couples. As noted earlier, most
respondents in the columns for married women are married to the men in the adjacent
column for married men; however, the correspondence is not complete, which accounts for
the modest differences in statistics measured at the couple-level. Table 2 shows that in
about one-half of couples, both spouses were employed at baseline. Perhaps surprisingly,
this statistic is only slightly higher among the boomer cohorts (married women
subsample). The husband-wife age difference has declined across cohorts, falling from 2.7

work is defined as working less than 35 hours per week or less than 36 weeks per year.

years among married women in the earlier cohorts to 2.0 years in the boomer cohorts.
Correspondingly, while 69 percent of married women were married to older men in the
early cohorts, somewhat fewer—63 percent—are married to older men in the boomer
cohorts.
In the HRS, respondents are asked about their future employment expectations.
Specifically, they are asked to state the chance they will work full-time after age 62, and age
65. Among married women, the mean stated chance of working full-time after 65 has risen
from 18 percent to 25 percent across cohorts. Men, too, increasingly expect to work fulltime after 65, with the mean stated chance rising from 30 percent to 36 percent across
cohorts.
I next use the longitudinal information in the HRS to measure observed transitions to
early retirement, specifically the percent reducing work effort within eight years of their
baseline interview (ages 51 to 56). A reduction in work effort is defined as 1) a transition
from full-time work to either part-time work or no work, or 2) a transition from part-time
work to no work. Table 2 shows that 51 percent of married women in the early cohorts
retired early compared with 47 percent among the boomer cohorts. Notably, married men
are less likely to retire early than married women—43 percent in the early cohorts
compared with 41 percent in the boomer cohorts. Rates of re-entry, here defined as
increasing work effort within two years of reducing effort, are similar for married women
in the early and boomer cohorts (25 percent and 23 percent, respectively), but have fallen
for married men across cohorts (from 28 percent to 21 percent).

-10-

Finally, Table 2 shows that early retirement is somewhat more likely among women
whose husbands themselves expressed (at baseline) a below-average chance of working
full-time after 65.7 Among these women, 52 percent in the early cohorts retired early
compared with 48 percent of early-cohort women whose husbands expressed an aboveaverage chance of working full-time after 65. This difference by husband’s expectation is
smaller among boomer women, suggesting that women in later cohorts may be less
influenced by their husband’s retirement expectations. Men, too, are more likely to retire
early when their wives held a below-average baseline expectation of working full-time
after 65 than when their wives held an above-average expectation; that said, men in
general appear somewhat less likely than women to be influenced by their spouse’s
retirement expectation.
III.

The Return to Continued Work for Married Women
The relative rise in full-time employment among older married women compared

with men in Figures 1 and 2 indicates greater labor force attachment among more recent
cohorts of older married women. One candidate explanation for this pattern is that the
return to additional years of work has risen for married women relative to married men.
The return to additional work has at least two key components: the additional earnings
earned and the incremental gain in future Social Security benefit payments (also known as
Social Security wealth).8

A “below-average” stated probability of working full-time after 65 is a stated chance less than the
married sample mean of 28 percent.
8
Another potential component is the incremental gain in lifetime pension benefits for those with an
employer-sponsored pension plan, offset by the foregone value of the annual pension benefit if the
7

-11-

The first piece of evidence in support of the hypothesis of a rising return to additional
work came from Table 1, where we saw that boomer women enter their early fifties
earning substantially more (31 percent) than women in earlier cohorts, and that this
growth in earnings has outpaced cross-cohort growth in earnings for men (10 percent). In
this section, I examine the subsequent trajectory of earnings from ages 51 to 64 for married
women compared with married men to test if there are material differences in the slopes of
the age-earnings profiles. I then turn to an analysis of Social Security wealth to investigate
whether there are differential gains in Social Security wealth from additional years of
earnings for married women relative to men.
A. Age-Earnings Profiles
The age-earnings profiles for married women and men in each cohort group are
shown in Figure 3. Earnings are in 2012 dollars, top coded at $250,000 to address extreme
values, and exclude those with zero earnings. The age-earnings profile for married women
is flat from age 51 until their early sixties, and is considerably higher for boomer women
than for women in earlier cohorts. In contrast, the age-earnings profile for married men
visibly declines with age in both cohort groups. This decline in real earnings for men—
reflecting stagnant earnings growth as well as a rising incidence of part-time work—results
in a marked narrowing of the male-female earnings gap by the early sixties.
To extract a clearer picture of the relative changes for married women and men, I next
estimate the slopes of the female and male age-earnings profiles. Table 3 presents

individual could have collected pension benefits in the year in question (see Maestas, 2001 for a model of
the return to additional work).

-12-

coefficients from ordinary least squares regressions of real earnings (conditional on
employment) on a quadratic function of age, estimated separately for married women and
married men in each cohort group, and using the data in longitudinal format (person-wave)
as described above. To account for selection into continued employment on the basis of
labor force attachment and prior earnings, I include controls for baseline earnings, baseline
hours worked per week, baseline weeks worked per year, tenure in the baseline job,
lifetime number of years worked as of baseline, and a series of indicators for groups of
three-digit occupations.9 Also included are indicators of college degree status, race and
ethnicity, self-reported fair or poor health status (measured at baseline), household wealth
quintile (measured at baseline), and HRS cohort designation. The coefficients on the
quadratic age function indicate that each additional year of age is associated with a relative
gain in real earnings for married women compared with married men. Since the shape of
the age profile is difficult to infer from the coefficients alone, Figure 4 plots predicted
earnings by age relative to predicted earnings at age 51, using the age coefficients from
Table 3. Panel A shows the age-earnings profile for married men and married women in the
early cohorts, while Panel B shows the profiles for the boomer cohorts. In both cohort
groups, women’s real earnings rise slightly until age 55, stabilize, and then trend
downward after age 57. In contrast, real earnings for men decline annually from ages 51 to

9

The groups of three-digit occupations are based on the 1980 Census classification as follows:
Managerial specialty operation (003-037); Professional specialty operation and technical support (043235); Sales (243-285); Clerical, administrative support (303-389); Service: private household, cleaning
and building services (403-407); Service: protection (413-427); Service: food preparation (433-444);
Health services (445-447); Personal services (448-469); Farming, forestry, fishing (473-499); Mechanics
and repair (503-549); Construction trade and extractors (553-617); Precision production (633-699);
Operators: machine (703-799); Operators: transport, etc. (803-859); Operators: handlers, etc. (863-889);
Member of Armed Forces (900).

-13-

61. As a result, at every age the return to continued work for women is greater than it is for
men, and grows until at least age 64.10
I next investigate whether the changes in annual earnings with age in Figure 4 appear
to correspond with changes in extensive margin labor supply, or changes in the real wage
rate. Table 4 presents estimates from separate models of the age-wage (Panel A), age-hours
(Panel B), and age-weeks (Panel C) profiles, each estimated using the specification in Table
3. Figure 5 plots the predicted weekly wage by age (relative to the weekly wage at age 51).
For married women in both cohorts, the age profile in the weekly wage largely tracks the
age profile in earnings (although it is somewhat flatter for boomer women in their early
fifties). The pattern for married men is more nuanced. Among men in the early cohorts, the
weekly wage rises modestly until their mid-fifties, when it begins to decline. The declining
age-earnings profile for early-cohort men in their early fifties, it appears, may have been
driven by changes in extensive margin labor supply. Among boomer men, the weekly wage
declines in tandem with earnings.
Figures 6 and 7 show the measures of extensive margin labor supply, predicted hours
worked per week and predicted weeks worked per year, respectively. These figures
indicate that among men in both cohorts, the decline in the earnings profile in their early
fifties coincides with modest reductions in hours per week, while weeks worked are stable.
For women, hours per week and weeks worked per year are either flat or trending
downward beginning in their early fifties. Thus, it does not appear married women are

The age-earnings profile for divorced and separated women (not shown) is similar to that of married
women in both cohorts. See Olivetti and Rotz, This Volume for an analysis of divorce risk and labor
supply.

achieving their stable earnings profile by compensating for real losses in earnings with
increases in extensive margin labor supply.
B. Social Security Wealth
The earnings patterns documented thus far indicate that lifetime earnings for married
women have risen across cohorts, both absolutely and relative to the earnings of men, thus
resulting in a narrowing of the gender gap in earnings with age. The gain in lifetime
earnings for married women has important implications for women’s retirement security,
particularly considering the risks of divorce and widowhood. In this section, I first examine
the effects of continued work on individual Social Security wealth. I then turn to the
relative contributions of continued work by women and men to the Social Security wealth
of the household, accounting for the value of spouse and survivor benefits. Finally, I
investigate whether it is the case that individuals with larger potential gains from delaying
retirement and claiming are more likely to work longer.
1. Individual Social Security Wealth
Social Security retirement benefits are primarily determined by average earnings
over a 35-year period. As cultural norms once dictated married women should not engage
in labor market activity while raising children, married women have typically accrued
many more years of “zero” earnings than married men, resulting in low average lifetime
earnings and, correspondingly low Social Security retirement benefits. But as married
women in recent cohorts have accrued more years of work, along with higher annual
earnings, their Social Security benefit entitlements should have also risen.

-15-

Figure 8 shows that this is indeed the case. The figure shows predicted Social Security
wealth (SSW) for married women and married men in each cohort group, by potential
claiming age. SSW is the expected present value of future Social Security retirement
benefits based on the respondent’s actual earnings history until their baseline survey wave,
and assuming continued work at the same earnings until the target claiming age. SSW is
computed by applying Social Security’s benefit computation calculator (ANYPIA11) to the
restricted Social Security earnings records of HRS respondents (Kapinos et al., 2016). The
calculator applies all aspects of the benefit calculation formula, including adjustments for
early and delayed retirement. SSW is included in the publicly available RAND HRS files. For
each respondent, SSW is calculated for three potential claiming ages—the Early Retirement
Age (age 62); the Full Retirement Age (age 65 or 66 depending on birth cohort); and age 70
(the maximum benefit initiation age). For all three potential claiming ages, actual earnings
are measured until the baseline survey wave, and then projected forward to the indicated
claiming age.12 The projection uses a moving average of the last five years of earnings
(unequally weighted), and effectively assumes a flat profile in real earnings beyond the
baseline wave.
Figure 8 shows that at every claiming age, married women in the boomer cohorts (the
solid orange line) have substantially greater individual SSW than women in the earlier
cohorts (dotted orange line). For instance, mean SSW at 62 among married women in the

This measure only includes own benefit entitlements based on the respondent’s own earnings history. It
does not include the present value of any spouse benefits that would be paid based on the respondent’s
earnings record to either a current, past, or surviving spouse. For methodological details, see Kapinos et
al. (2016).

-16-

boomer cohorts is $145,644 compared with $115,609 in the early cohorts—an increase of
26 percent. SSW at 62 is also higher among boomer men ($167,558) than early-cohort men
($156,928), but by proportionately less (7 percent). Note that the underlying data are at
the respondent-level (as opposed to respondent-wave level in the age-earnings analyses),
and since predicted SSW can be computed for all three potential claiming ages if it can be
computed for one, the age profiles in SSW in Figure 8 are a balanced panel.13
Figure 8 also reveals a related important finding: if married women continued
working at the same annual earnings rate between ages 62 and 70 their Social Security
wealth would rise by a substantial amount—17 percent among early-cohort women and 10
percent among boomer women (the absolute gain is larger for boomer women, but they
have a higher base level at 62, resulting in a smaller percent change). In striking contrast,
mean predicted Social Security wealth declines slightly for men in both the early and
boomer cohorts (by -3 percent and -1 percent, respectively).
Thus, whereas additional years of work after age 62 do not increase Social Security
wealth for married men (even at constant real earnings), additional years of work make a
measurable increase in the SSW of married women.14 The reason is because the marginal
earnings replace earlier years of lower (or zero) earnings in the benefit computation
formula for women, but not for men. In fact, this is the only channel by which SSW can

13

In instances where respondents did not consent to release their Social Security earnings records, HRS
used imputation methods to construct the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) on which SSW is based.
Some 19 to 27 percent of respondents, depending on their baseline wave, received some form of PIA
imputation for this reason. A number of respondents did not consent at their first interview but did so at a
later interview, which ultimately reduced the number of respondents with missing earnings records. See
Kapinos et al. (2016) for details.
14
The same is also true for divorced and separated women.

increase in Figure 8. The increase in potential SSW is not due to the effect of delayed
claiming, or to the more favorable survival probabilities for women.15 Table 5 presents
estimates of the relative gain for married women in an OLS regression with married
women and men pooled, and including the same control variables as in Table 3. The
relative within-individual gain from ages 62 to 70 for married women compared to men is
a statistically significant $22,547 in the early cohorts and $20,202 for the boomer cohorts.
Overall, the gender gap in individual SSW would narrow to such a degree across
cohorts that continued work to age 70 would place married women on near equal footing
with married men, at least in terms of SSW. The equivalence might seem surprising given
married women earn less on average than married men. But the Social Security benefit
formula features a progressive replacement rate structure, and thus married women, at
their present position in the lifetime earnings distribution, benefit from this progressivity.
Overall, these patterns reveal the discordant individual incentives facing married
women and married men for continued work as they progress through their fifties and
early sixties. However, it is possible that this discordance is weakened by the role of spouse
and survivor benefits. I turn to this issue next.
2. Household Social Security Wealth

15

Recall that the actuarial adjustments in the benefit amount for early (age 62) and delayed (past Full
Retirement Age) claiming are designed to be actuarially fair. Thus on average in the U.S. population,
SSW is the same whether benefits are claimed at age 62 or 70. Therefore, in the absence of growth in
average lifetime earnings, the profile in SSW in Figure 8 should be flat. The slight reduction in SSW
between ages 65/66 and 70 for early-cohort men arises because the actuarial adjustment for delayed
claiming beyond the Full Retirement Age (65/66) was less than actuarially fair until 2005, when the 1943
birth cohort turned 62. Thus, for the early HRS cohorts, there was a small actuarial penalty associated
with delayed claiming. The slight average reduction for boomer men is likely a consequence of sampling
variation.

Under Social Security rules, married individuals are entitled to the larger of 1) a
retired worker benefit based on their own work history; or 2) a spouse benefit equal to 50
percent of their spouse’s retired worker benefit. Historically, nearly all recipients of spouse
benefits have been married women, whose own benefit entitlement was less than 50
percent of their husband’s benefit (and included many women who did not have enough
work history to qualify for any benefit on their own record). Social Security rules also
contain survivorship provisions. Widowed spouses are entitled to the larger of their own
retirement benefit or a survivor benefit equal to 100 percent of their spouse’s retirement
benefit. As with spouse benefits, nearly all recipients of survivor benefits have been
women.16
I approximate the proportion of women who would likely receive spouse benefits at
each potential claiming age with the percent whose predicted SSW is less than 50 percent
of their husband’s predicted SSW. By this approximation, 44 percent of early-cohort
women would have received spouse benefits had they and their husbands both claimed at
62. If, instead, both worked and delayed claiming until age 70, some 34 percent would have
received spouse benefits. However, among boomer women, only 15 percent would receive
spouse benefits if they and their husbands claimed at 62, and this would fall to just 11
percent with continued work until age 70.17
Similarly, I approximate the proportion of women who would receive survivor’s
benefits if they became widowed by the percent whose predicted SSW is less than 100

16

Spouse and survivor benefits are also available to divorced women if the marriage lasted at least 10
years and they have not remarried.
17
These approximations give rise to similar estimates by cohort as reported by the Social Security
Administration (Iams, 2016).

-19-

percent of their husband’s predicted SSW. By this approximation, 77 percent of earlycohort women would have received survivor benefits upon widowhood if both spouses had
claimed at age 62. In contrast, continued work to age 70 would reduce this number to 65
percent. Among boomer women, far fewer—30 percent—would receive survivor benefits
in the event of widowhood if both spouses had claimed at age 62, and continued work to
age 70 would reduce the figure to 27 percent.
But do these gains in individual SSW have any effect on household-level SSW or do
they simply crowd-out SSW that was already held in the form of spouse and survivor
entitlements? To assess this question I regress the gain in total household SSW—which as
constructed by the HRS includes expected spouse and survivor benefit entitlements—on
the potential change in individual SSW for the wife, and the potential change in individual
SSW for the husband. Recall that any within-individual gain in SSW reflects the effect of
added years of earnings, and so the marginal effect of an additional dollar of individual SSW
indicates the degree to which this dollar matters for household SSW. Table 6 presents the
coefficients from OLS regression models estimated separately by cohort group. Among the
early cohorts, a one-dollar increase in the wife’s individual SSW would have resulted in
only 14.5 cents additional household SSW—her SSW hardly matters. In contrast, a onedollar increase in the husband’s individual SSW would have yielded a $1.32 in additional
household SSW, reflecting the incremental gains in spouse and survivor benefits based
entirely on his earnings record for a large fraction of couples. However, the picture is quite
different for the boomer cohorts: a one-dollar increase in the wife’s individual SSW results
in 36 cents additional household SSW, while a one-dollar increase in the husband’s
individual SSW results in 87 cents additional household SSW. The earnings histories of
-20-

married men continue to matter most, but by substantially less than before, as the earnings
histories of married women begin to yield both individual and household-level benefits.
3. Potential Gains and Retirement Decisions
The potential gains in SSW from continued work are substantial, especially for
married women, but an important question is whether women factor these potential gains
into their employment decisions. To shed light on this question, I divide the potential gains
in individual SSW from continued work to age 70 into quartiles. I then tabulate the percent
of individuals in each quartile who are observed to “retire early”—that is, to reduce their
work effort within eight years of baseline. This simple tabulation, presented in Table 7,
reveals very little correlation between the magnitude of the potential gain and the percent
retiring early. For example, 49 percent of married women in the lowest potential gain
quartile (with a mean gain in SSW of just $1,315) subsequently retired early, and 46
percent of married women in the top potential gain quartile (with a mean gain of $36,654)
retired early. Interestingly, the pattern is similar for married men, although somewhat
fewer married men retire early than married women: 42 percent of men in the bottom gain
quartile (with a mean loss of $14,804) retired early, while 39 percent of men in the top gain
quartile (with a mean gain of $10,782) retired early. These patterns suggest that potential
gains in SSW do not factor into the retirement decisions of married women. This is also
true for married men, whose earnings histories dominate the accrual of household SSW.
IV.

Discussion and Conclusion
This cross-cohort analysis of the employment patterns of married women has

revealed several key findings. First, preferences for joint leisure persist among married
-21-

women and men in recent cohorts, suggesting that the tradeoff between the potential
return to continued work and preferences for joint leisure continues to be salient for
couples. Second, married women in the boomer cohorts enter their early fifties earning 31
percent more than their predecessors in earlier cohorts. Married men in the boomer
cohorts also earn more than their predecessors, but the growth across cohorts was 10
percent, notably less. Third, estimates of the shape of the age-earnings profiles for married
women and men in their fifties indicate that the return to additional work is stable for
women, but declining for men. Fourth, additional years of work beyond age 62 (the Early
Retirement Age), would make a measurable increase in the Social Security wealth of
married women. This is because the additional years of earnings at these ages replace
earlier years of lower or zero earnings in the retirement benefit computation formula. The
same is not true for men, who would see little, if any, increase in Social Security wealth if
they worked beyond age 62, presumably because the additional years of earnings do not
replace earlier years of lower earnings. Among the boomer cohorts, continued work places
married women and married men on equal footing in terms of Social Security wealth by age
70. Finally, I find that individuals with the largest potential gains in Social Security wealth
are just as likely to retire early as those with the least to gain. Individuals, it appears, do
not factor these potential gains into their employment decisions, and this raises the
question of whether individuals are able to accurately assess the opportunity costs
associated with reducing work effort before age 70.
In sum, these patterns provide evidence that married couples face discordant
incentives for continued work as they progress through their fifties and early sixties. My
analysis has quantified one component of the important tradeoff faced by older women as
-22-

they decide whether or not to work longer—the opportunity cost associated with reducing
work effort in tandem with their husbands. On the other side of this tradeoff is the utility
value placed on joint leisure.
Among married boomer women in their fifties, the opportunity cost of leaving the
labor force early has risen as their earnings have grown. This opportunity cost is
substantial and consists of both foregone earnings as well as incremental gains in Social
Security wealth. Additional work beyond age 62 makes up for lower labor supply earlier in
life, and can place married women on par with married men in terms of the lifetime
resources available to them in the latter part of life. Increasingly, these additional resources
will matter for the financial well-being of not just women themselves, but their husbands as
well.

at baseline, years in workforce at baseline, hours worked per week at baseline, weeks worked per year

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. Dependent variable in all columns is change in household-level
Social Security Wealth (SSW) between ages 62 and 70 if both spouses continue to work until age 70.
Models are OLS regression models. Individual SSW is the expected present discounted value of potential
Social Security benefits earned on the individual’s own record if he or she continued to work until the
claiming age of 70. Analysis sample is households of married women in the Early cohorts (HRS-Late and
War Babies) and Boomer cohorts (Early Baby Boom, excluding Mid Baby Boom). Data are structured in
cross-sectional format such that units of observation are household-level. Household Social Security
Wealth is the sum of each spouse’s individual SSW, any SSW attributable to spouse benefits, and SSW
attributable to survivor benefits. HRS respondent weights used. For methodological details, see Kapinos
et al., 2016 and Chien, 2015. *p<0.10 ** p<0.05 *** p<0.01

Notes: Percent Retiring Early is the percent who reduce work effort within 8 years of their baseline
wave. Social Security Wealth (SSW) is the expected present discounted value of potential Social Security
benefits earned on the individual’s own record if he or she continued to work until claiming at age 70.
Analysis sample contains married men and women who are age-eligible members of Early Cohorts (HRSLate and War Babies) and Boomer Cohorts (Early Baby Boom, excluding Mid Baby Boom). Data are
