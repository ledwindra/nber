JEL No. D6,H0
ABSTRACT
This paper characterizes the welfare gains from redistributive taxation and social insurance in an environment
where the private sector provides partial insurance. We analyze stylized models in which adverse
selection, pre-existing information, or imperfect optimization in private insurance markets create a
role for government intervention. We derive simple formulas that map reduced-form empirical estimates
into quantitative predictions for optimal tax and social insurance policy. Applications to unemployment
and health insurance show that taking private market insurance into account matters significantly for
optimal benefit levels given existing empirical estimates of the key parameters.

Introduction

A recent literature in public economics has begun to integrate the theory of optimal taxation
and social insurance with empirical evidence on behavioral responses to these policies. Several
studies have proposed “su¢ cient statistic”formulas to map elasticities estimated in the modern program evaluation literature into predictions about the welfare consequences of policies
(e.g., Diamond 1998, Saez 2001, Shimer and Werning 2008, Chetty 2008a-b). One important
limitation of existing su¢ cient statistic formulas is that they do not allow for private market
insurance, implicitly assuming that the government is the sole provider of insurance. Previous
theoretical and empirical studies have emphasized that the existence of private insurance can
lower the optimal level of social insurance.1 However, there is no method of mapping empirical evidence such as that of Cutler and Gruber (1996a) into quantitative statements about
the optimal level of government intervention in models such as that analyzed by Golosov and
Tsyvinski (2007).
The paper takes a step toward bridging this gap. We develop formulas for optimal taxation
and social insurance in stylized models that allow for partial private insurance. The formulas
are functions of reduced-form parameters that are frequently estimated in empirical studies,
and can therefore be easily adapted to analyze policies ranging from optimal tax and transfer
policy to unemployment and health insurance.
The starting point for our analysis is the speci…cation of the limits of private market insurance and the potential role for government intervention. There are at least …ve reasons that
government intervention could improve upon private insurance markets. First, private markets
can only insure against shocks that occur after agents purchase private insurance. Only the
government can provide redistribution across types revealed before private insurance contracts
are signed. Second, informational asymmetries can lead to market unravelling through adverse
selection (Akerlof 1970). Third, even when private markets function perfectly, individuals may
su¤er from behavioral biases such as myopia or overcon…dence that lead them to underinsure
relative to the optimum (Kaplow 1991, DellaVigna 2008, Spinnewijn 2008). Fourth, private
…rms generally cannot sign exclusive contracts, leading to ine¢ cient outcomes because of multiple dealing (Pauly 1974).

Finally, some studies have argued that the administrative and

present evidence that crowdout of private insurance is substantial in health care.

marketing costs of private insurance exceed those of public insurance (Woolhandler, Campbell,
and Himmelstein 2003; Reinhardt, Hussey, and Anderson 2004) because of increasing returns
and zero-sum strategic competition.
In this paper, we characterize the welfare gains from government intervention under the
…rst three private market limitations.2 We analyze models in which the agent’s earnings vary
across states. This variation can be interpreted as uncertainty due to shocks, as in a social
insurance problem, or as variation in earnings ability behind the veil of ignorance, as in an
optimal taxation problem. The model permits suboptimal choice of private insurance as well
as market limitations due to pre-existing information or adverse selection. We derive a formula
for the welfare gain from increasing the government tax rate (or social insurance bene…t) that
depends on …ve parameters: (1) the variation in consumption across states and risk types,
(2) the curvature of the utility function, (3) the elasticity of e¤ort with respect to the tax
or bene…t rate, (4) the size of the private insurance market, and (5) the crowdout of private
insurance by public insurance. The …rst three parameters are standard elements of su¢ cient
statistic formulas for optimal taxation and social insurance without private insurance; the last
two are the new elements. In addition to o¤ering a method of making quantitative predictions
about welfare gains, our analysis yields three qualitative lessons.
First, and most importantly, standard optimal tax and social insurance formulas overstate
the optimal degree of redistribution in the presence of private insurance that generates moral
hazard. A planner may observe substantial income inequality and conclude based on classic
optimal tax results that redistributive taxation would improve welfare. However, if the observed earnings distribution already re‡ects implicit insurance provided by the private sector
–e.g. through wage compression by …rms –then making the redistribution through taxation
could reduce welfare via its e¤ects on the private insurer’s budget. In the extreme case where
private insurance markets function optimally, the planner would end up strictly reducing welfare by implementing such redistributive taxes (Kaplow 1991).

Intuitively, the government

exacerbates the moral hazard distortion created by private-sector insurance, and must therefore take into account the amount of private insurance and degree of crowdout to calculate the
optimal policy. Taking the observed earnings distribution as a re‡ection of marginal products
2
We do not consider multiple dealing as it is treated in detail by Pauly (1974). We also do not consider
administrative costs, but conjecture that it would be straightforward to extend the formulas we develop to
incorporate such costs using estimates of loading factors for public and private insurance.

2

–as is standard practice both in the theory of optimal taxation and in policy debates –may
therefore lead to misleading conclusions about optimal tax policy.
The second lesson is that it is important to distinguish private insurance mechanisms that
generate moral hazard from those that do not. While “formal” arms-length insurance contracts are likely to generate as much moral hazard as public insurance, “informal”risk sharing
arrangements – such as borrowing from close relatives or relying on spousal labor supply to
bu¤er shocks –may involve much less moral hazard. When private insurance does not generate moral hazard, the formula for optimal government bene…ts coincides exactly with existing
formulas that ignore private insurance completely.

This is because the e¤ect of informal

private insurance is already captured in the smaller consumption-smoothing e¤ect of public
insurance. This point is of practical importance because existing empirical studies estimate
the extent of formal and informal insurance without distinguishing their policy implications
(e.g. Townsend 1994, Cullen and Gruber 2000, Attanasio and Rios-Rull 2000, Schoeni 2002).
The third lesson is that even when the level of private insurance enters the formula for
optimal bene…ts, it matters for a very di¤erent reason than what is traditionally emphasized
in the literature (e.g. Cutler and Gruber 1996a). The conventional wisdom is based on Okun’s
proverbial “leaky bucket:”more government expenditure is required to achieve a given increase
in insurance coverage when there is crowdout of private insurance. Since the marginal cost
of public funds exceeds one, this leakage lowers the welfare gain from public insurance. In our
model, this channel does not operate because a formal private insurance contract generates
exactly the same moral hazard distortion in e¤ort as public insurance. The added deadweight
burden generated by higher taxes to fund public insurance is exactly o¤set by the reduction
in deadweight burden because of lower formal private insurance premiums.3 The reason that
the level of formal private insurance actually matters is that it imposes a …scal externality on
the public sector, as in Pauly (1974), where non-exclusive insurance contracts lead to overprovision of insurance.
To illustrate how our formula can be applied to obtain quantitative predictions about
optimal policy, we present applications to unemployment insurance (UI) and health insurance.
In the unemployment application, we focus on severance pay provided by private employers
3
In practice, government insurance programs may be funded using more distortionary tools than private
insurance programs. In this case, the deadweight burden o¤set is less than 100% and the bucket becomes
leaky.

3

as a form of private insurance. Severance pay generates moral hazard because it can induce
workers to shirk on the job, since they do not fully internalize the costs of being laid o¤.
Using variation in UI bene…t laws across states in the U.S., we estimate that a 10% increase in
UI bene…t levels reduces private insurance against job loss (severance pay) by approximately
7%. Plugging this estimate into our formula along with other parameter estimates from the
existing literature, we …nd that there is a fairly wide range of parameters for which standard
formulas that ignore private insurance and crowdout imply that raising the bene…t level would
raise welfare when in fact it would lower welfare.
Our second application explores the welfare gains from expanding public health insurance
(e.g. Medicare and Medicaid) using existing estimates of behavioral responses to health insurance. Calibrations of our formula suggest that the aggregate level of public health insurance is
near the optimum given the amount of private insurance and its response to public insurance.
Accounting for private insurance is very important: the standard formula that ignores the
private insurance provision overstates the welfare gain from an aggregate expansion of public
health insurance by a factor of more than 100 with existing elasticity estimates. Note that
these calibration results are based on a representative-agent model with elasticity estimates
for the aggregate population.

There are likely to be subgroups of the population that are

underinsured, such as low income individuals, and others that are overinsured. Our analysis
should therefore be interpreted not as a policy recommendation but rather as a call for further
work estimating the key elasticities by subgroup to identify how public health insurance should
be reformed.
This paper builds on and relates to several strands of the literature on optimal insurance.
One theoretical literature has considered optimal insurance and government redistribution
problems jointly (e.g., Blomqvist and Horn, 1984, Rochet, 1991, Cremer and Pestieau, 1996).
These papers analyze models with heterogeneity in ability to earn (as in Mirrlees 1971) coupled
with ex-post shocks to income (such as a health shock). In these models, the government is
the sole provider of insurance, and chooses both an optimal income tax schedule and a social
insurance program.4 In contrast, our paper considers a simpler model with a single source of
earnings heterogeneity, which does not distinguish between risk and ability but allows public
4
An exception is Boadway et al. (2006), who allow for private insurance. However, they assume that private
insurers observe ability while the government does not. In our model, private and public insurers have the
same informational constraints.

4

and private insurance to coexist.
Models with private and public insurance have been considered in the literature on optimal
health insurance (e.g., Besley 1989, Selden 1993, Blomqvist and Johansson 1997, Petretto
1999, Encinosa 2003, Barrigozzi 2006). We develop empirically implementable formulas for
the welfare gains from public insurance in such models.

Our formulas help to connect the

theoretical work to the corresponding empirical literature on the interaction between private
and public health insurance (e.g., Ginsburg 1988, Taylor et al. 1988, Wolfe and Godderis 1991,
Cutler and Gruber 1996a-b, Finkelstein 2004). The formulas we derive are in the same spirit
as recent su¢ cient statistic formulas in that they shed light on the essential features of the
models that matter for welfare analysis.

However, unlike typical su¢ cient statistic results,

the formulas we derive here are based on stylized models and therefore may not be fully robust
to modi…cations of the primitive structure, an issue that we discuss in greater detail in the
conclusion.
The most closely related paper to our study is that of Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2008),
who develop a di¤erent method of characterizing welfare in a model with adverse selection in
the private insurance market.

Einav et al. show that the slopes of the demand and cost

curves for private insurance are together su¢ cient statistics for welfare. Our formula depends
instead on ex-post behavioral responses to change in government bene…t levels.
formulas are complements.

The two

Einav et al.’s method is easier to implement when exogenous

price variation in insurance markets and demand and cost data are available; our formulas
may be easier to implement when there is variation in government bene…t levels that permits
estimation of ex-post behavioral responses. Likewise, Einav et al.’s method will yield reliable
results in markets where ex-ante insurance purchase decisions reveal true preferences, while
our formulas rely on optimization of choices such as consumption and labor supply.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin in section 2 by analyzing
a model without private insurance as a benchmark. In Section 3, we introduce endogenous
private insurance by studying a model in which the government and private sector have the
same tools, but the level of private insurance is not necessarily set optimally.

Section 4

considers a model with market limitations due to the inability of the private sector to insure
pre-existing risks and adverse selection. The applications are presented in section 5. Section
6 concludes.

Benchmark: Second-Best Contract

We analyze models where the government uses tax or social insurance policies to redistribute
income across individuals with di¤erent levels of earnings.

Risk averse individuals would

like to insure themselves against the risk of having low output realizations.

If e¤ort were

observable, the “…rst-best” contract would provide full insurance and the agents would be
required to exert the …rst best optimal level of e¤ort. If e¤ort is unobservable, the …rst-best
contract is not incentive compatible. The optimal contract when e¤ort is unobservable speci…es
consumption levels contingent on output realization that reduce the variance of consumption.
In this section, we characterize this “second-best” contract, which re‡ects the optimal policy
for a single insurer (government or private). This is the problem considered in previous studies
that developed su¢ cient statistic formulas for taxation and social insurance (e.g. Saez 2001,
Chetty 2006a).
We analyze this problem using two canonical models in the optimal tax and social insurance
literatures. The …rst is a “moral hazard” model, in which the level of output is a stochastic
function of the individual’s e¤ort choice. This model, which is equivalent to Varian’s (1980)
model of taxation, can be interpreted as a model of optimal social insurance against shocks
such as unemployment or illness.5

The second model is a “hidden skill” model, in which

the uncertainty about output (skill) levels is resolved before individuals choose e¤ort. This
model is the same as that studied by Mirrlees (1971), and is more naturally suited to studying
optimal redistribution across individuals with di¤erent skills.

To simplify the analysis, we

restrict attention to optimal linear contracts throughout, and show that the two models yield
the same results for such contracts.

2.1

Model 1: Moral Hazard

Consider a model with a continuum of identical individuals of measure one who exert e¤ort
e to produce output z. There are two states of output, high and low, with zH > zL . The
probability of producing zH is e.

Let z = e zH + (1

e) zL denote the average level of

output. The utility of consumption c is u(c) and the disutility of e¤ort is

(e). Utility u(c)

In the empirical applications in section 5, we translate the results from this model into the notation used
in the social insurance literature. In the theoretical analysis, we use the tax notation to highlight similarities
between the formulas in the two models.

(e) is increasing and convex.

The individual chooses e to maximize his expected utility,

(e)
0

This leads to the …rst order condition

(e) =

u(cL ), which implicitly de…nes an e¤ort supply function e (cH ; cL ).

Any feasible contract (cH ; cL ) must leave the insurer with zero pro…ts: c

ecH +(1 e)cL =

z. Because there are only two states, a contract (cH ; cL ) that satis…es the insurer’s break-even
constraint can be characterized by a single tax rate m along with a lump sum repayment of
the tax revenue mz:
cH = (1

m)zH + tz, cL = (1

m)zL + mz.

The agent’s e¤ort e depends on the net of tax rate 1 m. Thus, average earnings is a function
of the net-of-tax rate 1

m, which we denote by z(1

m).

The optimal second-best contract sets m to maximize the agent’s expected utility:
W =e

m)) + (1

e ) u((1

m))

(e ). (1)

Our objective is to characterize the marginal welfare gain from increasing the tax rate ( dW
dm )
in terms of empirically estimable parameters. Since e is chosen to maximize expected utility,
we can use the envelope theorem when di¤erentiating (1) to obtain

are not policy invariant. Therefore, equation (2) can only be used for local welfare analysis:
the welfare consequences of changes in tax rates around the point at which the elasticities are
estimated.

rate would both increase redistribution and (weakly) increase tax revenue, strictly improving
welfare. Again, because all the terms on the right hand side are functions of the the tax rate
m itself, (3) should not be viewed as an explicit formula for the optimal tax rate.

Rather,

it provides a simple condition to test whether a given tax rate is optimal and highlights the
parameters that matter for optimal taxation.
Three aspects of this formula deserve mention First, the elasticity "z;1

m

measures the

total e¤ect of a change in the tax rate on earnings, including the response to the change in
the lump sum grant. Hence, this elasticity re‡ects a mix of substitution and income e¤ects.
To see this, let z u (1

m; E) denote the agent’s standard Marshallian average earnings supply

function, which maps the tax rate m and lump sum grant E to a level of average earnings.
Since z(1 m) = z u (1 m; mz(1 m)), it follows that

thus di¤ers from the standard parameters estimated in the empirical literature, which

typically estimate "uz;1

or the pure substitution e¤ect.

Second, when the agent is risk averse, u0 (cH ) < u0 (cL ), and hence cov(z; u0 ) < 0. Combined
with the fact that "z;1

m

> 0, this implies that the optimal tax rate m is strictly positive. If

utility is linear and the agent is risk neutral, the optimal tax rate is zero. At the other extreme,

if risk aversion is in…nite and zL = 0, then the optimal tax rate is the revenue maximizing tax

m.

More generally, between these extremes, the optimal

tax rate m increases with risk aversion, holding "z;1

constant.

Third, (3) remains a valid formula for the optimal linear tax rate in a model with more
than two states, including the case with a continuous state space typically analyzed in income
tax models.

2.2

Model 2: Hidden Skills

Now consider a “hidden skill” model of optimal taxation where individuals di¤er in privately
observed ability n and choose e¤ort levels after ability is revealed.

Let the distribution of

skills be given by a density f (n) and normalize the size of the population to 1. An individual
who works l hours and has ability n earns z = nl.
To simplify the analysis, we eliminate income e¤ects by considering the following form for
utility (as in Diamond (1998)):
U (c; z; n) = u c

h

z
n

,

(5)

where u(:) is a concave and increasing function re‡ecting risk aversion, and h(:) is increasing
and convex and represents disutility of work. With a linear tax, c = (1
…rst order condition for z is n(1

m) = h0 (z=n). We denote by " =

average earnings in the population and "z;1

=

h0 (z=n)
h00 (z=n) z=n

zf (n)dn denote

the elasticity of average earnings z with respect

to the net-of-tax rate.7
Suppose there is a single insurer who o¤ers a linear insurance contract with tax rate m
behind the veil of ignorance (i.e., before individuals learn about their ability n). As above, the
tax revenue is rebated as a lump sum grant mz. The insurer chooses m to maximize
Z

W = u z (1 m) + mz h

(6)

Formulas (6) in the hidden skill model and formula (3) in the moral hazard model are identical.
Hence, the optimal linear tax rate is driven by the same economic forces in both models.8
Both optimal tax formulas (3) and (6) can be derived heuristically as follows. Suppose the
insurer increases m by dm. The direct utility cost for individual with earnings z is

u0 (c) zdm.

The behavioral response to dm does not generate a …rst order e¤ect on utility because of
R
the envelope theorem. Therefore, in aggregate, the direct welfare cost is dW = dm u0
zf (n)dn. The mechanical increase in tax revenue (ignoring behavioral responses) due to dm
is dM = zdm. The behavioral response in earnings reduces tax revenue by dB =
m
1 m "z;1 m

m dz =

zdm. Hence, the lump sum grant increases by dM + dB, increasing welfare by

u0 (dM + dB) = u0 z [1

1 m "z;1 m ]dm.

At the optimum, these e¤ects must all cancel so

that dW + u0 (dM + dB) = 0, which yields (3) and (6).

Public Insurance with Endogenous Private Insurance

We now turn to the problem of optimal government insurance with endogenous private insurance. We …rst analyze the case in which the private insurance level is set arbitrarily, and then
turn to the special case where it is set optimally. The level of private insurance level might
not be optimized because of individual failures – left to their own devices, individuals may
purchase too little insurance.

3.1

General Case: Private Insurance not Necessarily Optimized

Moral Hazard Model.

We begin by introducing notation to distinguish the private and

government insurance contracts.

Let

t the tax rate in the private insurance contract.

Concretely, the private insurer can be thought of as a …rm that

products, and hence sets taxes as a function of w.9
Let m denote the total tax rate on output, de…ned such that 1

m)z + mz. If the private insurer and government cooperated to set m to maximize

social welfare, the resulting contract would be identical to that described in the single insurer
setting above. However, in practice private insurers take the government contract
when they choose t.

as given

As a result, they fail to internalize the e¤ects of their choice of t on

the government’s budget. Because of this externality e¤ect, the government needs to follow a
di¤erent rule in setting the optimal tax rate

that adjusts for the private insurer’s response.

Let t( ) denote the private insurer’s choice of t as a function of the government tax. In
this subsection, we take the function

! t( ) as given, and do not assume that t( ) is chosen

optimally to maximize the agent’s expected utility. Let r =

d log(1

t)=d log(1

the rate at which public insurance crowds out private insurance. If r = 0, there is no crowdout.
If r = 1, there is perfect crowdout.

to maximize the agent’s expected utility, taking into account

Proposition 1 shows that private insurance a¤ects the formula for the optimal tax rate in
two ways. First, the added

t term on the right side of (9) re‡ects the mechanical reduction

in the optimal level of government taxation given the presence of private insurance. Formula
(9) shows that the sum of private and public insurance should be set according to the standard
formula, and hence the optimal

is reduced in proportion to t. The second e¤ect is that the

inverse elasticity term is multiplied by 1
government tax rate smaller.

r. Since r > 0, this e¤ect also makes the optimal

Intuitively, the elasticity relevant for optimal taxation is the

fundamental elasticity of output with respect to total taxes "z;1

m

= "w;1

m,

which measures

the total moral hazard cost (to both the private and public insurers) of redistributing one dollar
of tax revenue. To recover the fundamental output elasticity in the presence of crowdout, one
must rescale the observed elasticity "w;1

by

1
1 r.

Therefore, the crowdout rate r only matters

for rescaling the observed elasticity, and plays no fundamental economic role in the formula. If
one could measure the fundamental elasticity "w;1

m

directly, an estimate of crowdout would

be unnecessary.
This intuition about the relevance of crowdout di¤ers from the conventional wisdom (see
e.g., Cutler and Gruber 1996a-b). The conventional wisdom is that crowdout makes government intervention less desirable because it requires more government expenditure to achieve a
given insurance level, and raising revenue to …nance government expenditure is costly because
of the deadweight burden of taxation.

This intuition does not apply in our model because

12

the tax levied by the private insurer generates exactly the same deadweight burden as government taxation. A natural counterargument is that private insurance may not generate moral
hazard because private insurers can monitor e¤ort more closely. However, we show in section
3.3 that in this case, crowdout is actually irrelevant because the optimal private contract does
not generate externalities.
An important implication of (9) is that if the wage structure already re‡ects implicit
insurance provided by the private sector, then standard optimal tax formulas that are functions
of the observed wage distributions and wage earnings elasticities are invalid. Intuitively, the
private sector already bears a moral hazard cost for the insurance it provides. The government
exacerbates this pre-existing distortion by introducing additional insurance. Therefore, one
must take into account the amount of private insurance to back out the optimal policy.10
In the simple model considered here, the planner can replicate the second-best optimal
allocation by choosing the level of

that generates the optimal m given the private insurer’s

response. The second best can be achieved because private and public insurance are identical
tools in this model: the role for government emerges if private insurance is not set optimally.
When the government and private sector have di¤erent tools – as in the adverse selection
model analyzed in section 4 –the second best level of welfare can no longer be achieved.

With these de…nitions, equations (8) and (9) of

Proposition 1 can be obtained by following a proof that has exactly the same steps.

3.2

Special Case: Optimized Private Insurance

To gain further insight into the e¤ects of government intervention and connect our results
to the existing literature, we now consider the special case where private insurance is chosen
optimally to maximize expected utility.

The following proposition characterizes the e¤ects

of government intervention on social welfare when private insurance is optimized in both the
moral hazard and hidden skill models.
Proposition 2. If private insurance is set optimally,
10

In redistributive taxation applications, it is challenging to measure the private insurance rate t because the
di¤erence between w and z is not directly observed. Conceptually, one must estimate the di¤erence between
observed wages and marginal products. In social insurance applications, private insurance typically involves
explicit transfers, and can therefore be measured directly.

Proof. In the interest of space, we provide a proof only for the moral hazard model. An

Optimal Private Contract. In a competitive market where insurers are price takers, the
private insurer takes the government tax rate

and the lump sum grant R = w as given

when setting t. Therefore, t is chosen to maximize:
W = e u((1 t)(1

This proposition shows that the standard lessons of the theory of excess burden apply in
our model: the welfare cost of taxation is proportional to the size of the behavioral response
to taxation and the marginal cost of taxation increases linearly with the tax rate. However,
there is one important di¤erence relative to the traditional analysis. In standard models of
taxation and social insurance without endogenous private insurance, the deadweight burden
of taxation is an e¢ ciency cost that the government would be willing to trade-o¤ against the
bene…ts of more insurance. In the present model, the level of redistribution through market
insurance is already optimal given incentive constraints, and thus the net welfare gain equals
the deadweight burden of taxation.

Hence, a benevolent government should do precisely

nothing.
When private insurance markets function optimally, government insurance via taxation or
social insurance strictly reduces welfare because crowdout of private insurance is imperfect. To
understand the intuition, it is helpful to consider an example. Suppose the government naively
thinks it can achieve the second-best optimum by setting
and (1

and R such that (1

)zH +R = cH

)zL + R = cL where (cL ; cH ) denotes the optimal second-best insurance contract

for a single insurer.

This tax system would achieve the optimum described in Section 2 if

the private insurance market chose not to provide any insurance.

However, zero insurance

is not the contract that will emerge in an economy with a private insurance market. Since
zL (1

) + R < zH (1

) + R, individuals will …nd it worthwhile to purchase further insurance
15

from private providers. This additional insurance would increase the expected utility of the
agent and the insurance companies would break even. But the individual and private insurer
do not internalize the e¤ect of their choices on the government’s budget. The added private
insurance reduces e¤ort below the second-best optimum and hence leads to a lower average
output than the government was expecting. As a result, the government goes into de…cit and
its lumpsum grant R needs to be reduced.11
We are not the …rst to make the point that government intervention is undesirable when
private insurance markets function e¢ ciently.

When private insurance is set optimally, the

market equilibrium with no government intervention is information-constrained Pareto e¢ cient. Abstractly, it is well known that when the private market equilibrium is constrained
e¢ cient, government price distortions lead to ine¢ ciency (Prescott and Townsend 1984a-b).
Kaplow (1991) makes a similar point about the welfare losses from government intervention in
a simple social insurance model, and Blomqvist and Johannson (1997) and Barrigozzi (2006)
obtain similar results in a model with public and private health insurance.

The main con-

tribution of the present paper is to develop formulas for the welfare gains from government
intervention when the private market does not reach the second-best optimum.
Two additional remarks on Proposition 2 deserve mention. First, we expect that the
relationship between the degree of crowdout r and risk aversion will generally have an inverted
U-shape. When individuals are risk neutral (u(c) = c), there is no private insurance (t = 0)
so there is by de…nition no crowdout (r = 0). At the other extreme, with in…nite risk aversion
and zL = 0, cov(z; u0 ) =

z u0 and (13) combined with (14) implies that t=(1

Therefore, in the case of in…nite risk aversion, there

is also no crowdout. For any interior case with non-zero, …nite risk aversion, crowdout will
be positive and incomplete. Hence, government intervention is likely to induce the greatest
welfare losses when risk aversion is very low or very high, because these are the cases in which
crowdout will be small and individuals will end up being most over-insured.
Second, a corollary of Proposition 2 is that in the absence of private market failures, public
11
These results contrast with the analysis of Golosov and Tsyvinski (2007), who argue that government
insurance has no e¤ect on social welfare in static models because of 100% crowdout. The reason for the
di¤erence is that Golosov and Tsyvinski study government intervention where the government controls directly
the …nal consumption outcomes whereas we consider the e¤ects of distortionary taxation, which is typically the
nature of policies used in practice.

16

goods should be …nanced via a uniform lump-sum tax that generates the desired amount of
revenue, even if agents have di¤erent marginal utilities of income in each state. The private
insurance market will then set redistribution to the optimal level. A distortionary tax to …nance
the public good would lead to lower expected utility than a lump-sum tax that generated an
equivalent amount of revenue. This point underscores the substantial e¤ect that endogenous
private insurance arrangements can have on standard intuitions in the literatures on optimal
taxation and social insurance.

3.3

Private Insurance Without Moral Hazard

Thus far, we have considered private insurance contracts that generate the same amount of
moral hazard as public insurance. However, “informal”private risk-sharing mechanisms may
involve less moral hazard. Examples include self insurance through spousal labor supply or
insurance through relatives who can monitor e¤ort.12 In this section, we explore how the
degree of moral hazard in private insurance a¤ects our formulas.
Moral Hazard Model. Consider a model where government insurance generates moral hazard but private insurance does not. When private insurance does not generate moral hazard,
reaching the …rst-best of full insurance would be feasible in principle, completely eliminating
the role for government intervention. In practice, there are costs of informal insurance –such
as limits to liquidity, costs of borrowing from relatives, or relying on spousal labor supply –
that prevent full insurance. We model such costs by a loading factor on informal insurance
transfers: transferring T to the low state requires a payment of T + s(T ) in the high state
where s(:) is an increasing and convex loading factor cost with s(0) = 0. The informal insurance contract involves no moral hazard, in the sense that the agent internalizes the e¤ect of
his e¤ort choice on the insurer’s budget. Hence, e and T are chosen simultaneously (taking
and R as …xed) to maximize
eu[(zH

(T + s(T ))(1

e)=e))(1

) + R] + (1

e)u[(zL + T )(1

) + R]

(e):

The …rst-order-condition for T is:
u0 (cL ) u0 (cH )
= s0 (T ):
u0 (cH )
12

(15)

Another important example of informal insurance in developing economies is risksharing in villages
(Townsend 1994).

17

The government chooses
w = ewH + (1

to maximize social welfare, taking into account that R = w where

e)wL and wi is post-private insurance earnings.

max W ( ) = e u[(zH (T +s(T ))(1 e )=e ))(1

)+ w]+(1 e )u[(zL +T )(1

)+ w]

(e ):

Using the envelope conditions for e and T , we immediately obtain the following formula for
the welfare gain for raising :
dW
=
d

w u0

1

"w;1

+ cov(w=w; u0 =u0 )

(16)

This equation is the same as the standard formula (2) in the benchmark single insurer model.
It shows that private insurance that does not generate moral hazard can be ignored in the calculation of optimal government redistribution. This result is consistent with Chetty (2006a),
who shows that Baily’s (1978) formula is robust to allowing for arbitrary choices in the private
sector as long as they are constrained e¢ cient. To be clear, this result does not imply that the
optimal government bene…t level is una¤ected by the presence of private insurance. A higher
informal private insurance bene…t T will reduce the optimal

by reducing the correlation

between u0 and w in (16).
Hidden Skill Model. In the hidden skill model, informal private insurers can make lump
sum transfers Tn to individuals with ability n by paying a loading cost s(Tn ).13

Note that

Tn < 0 corresponds to a lump sum tax on type n. The private insurer and individuals take
and R as given, and simultaneously choose zn and Tn to maximize
Z h
zn i
u (zn (Tn + s(Tn ))(1
)+R h
f (n)dn:
n
R
subject to the budget constraint Tn f (n)dn
0 (multiplier ). The …rst order condition
for zn implies that h0 (zn =n) = n(1

), i.e., the government tax reduces incentives to work

but not the amount of informal insurance. The …rst order condition for Tn implies that
u0 (cn ) (1 + s0 (Tn )) (1

) = : marginal utility is equalized up to the loading factor.

Let us denote by w = z

(T + s(T )) post-insurance earnings. The government chooses

to maximize:

where the last term is obtained using u0 (cn ) (1 + s0 (Tn )) (1

R
out as Tn f (n)dn = 0 is constant with . Hence, we obtain again the standard formula.

Why does only private insurance that generates moral hazard change the formulas for

optimal taxation? When private insurance generates moral hazard, the changes in e induced
by government intervention have a …rst-order externality on the private-insurer’s budget and
must therefore be taken into account directly in the formula. If private insurance does not
generate moral hazard, the …scal externality term disappears because e is chosen jointly with
T to optimize W .
The irrelevance of informal insurance again challenges the existing literature, which views
all crowdout of private insurance as reducing the welfare gains from government intervention.
In the context of informal insurance, the conventional wisdom would posit that if distortionary
government insurance partly displaces non-distortionary private insurance, then government
intervention increases moral hazard e¢ ciency costs and is less desirable. This reasoning misses
the point that informal insurance itself must have costs if individuals are not fully insured in
equilibrium. If informal private insurance is optimized, the marginal welfare loss from having
less informal insurance must be exactly o¤set by the marginal gain from paying less for that
insurance (s0 (T )), as shown by (15). Since the costs and bene…ts cancel out at the margin,
the displacement of informal insurance by public insurance does not lead to a “leaky bucket”
despite the fact that the government achieves smaller increases in insurance coverage per dollar
spent.

4

Market Failures

In this section, we extend our formulas to allow for two market failures: pre-existing information and adverse selection. Pre-existing information refers to public information about
individuals’ability before insurance contracts are signed. Adverse selection refers to private
information about individuals’ability before insurance contracts are signed. Because income
19

e¤ects in the e¤ort decision greatly complicate the analysis, we focus exclusively on the hidden
skills model without income e¤ects in the labor supply decision.14

4.1

Pre-Existing Information

We model pre-existing public information as follows. The population is partitioned into K
exogenous groups k = 1; ::; K. For instance, the groups could represent health status or geographic region of birth. Group k contains a fraction pk of the population and has (conditional)
P
density of abilities fk (n) so that f (n) = k pk fk (n). Group identity is known by both private
insurers and individuals before signing insurance contracts, but the realization of n within a

group is unknown to both insurers and individuals when signing the contract. As a result,
private insurance is o¤ered within each group k. The private insurer o¤ers an insurance rate
tk conditional on group k.
Section 3.

When there is a single group, this corresponds to the model in

At the other extreme, when the number of groups is as large as the number of

individuals, all information is revealed before contracts can be signed and there is no scope for
private insurance contracts. In contrast, the government can impose redistributive taxation
on the entire population.
We assume that the government is restricted to using a uniform tax rate

on earnings.

This is a strong assumption in the present model because the government could potentially
improve welfare by conditioning tax rates on groups, but it is useful to gain insight into the
key features of the problem.15
We now introduce notation for the multiple-group case. Let mk denote the total tax rate in
group k such that 1

mk = (1

La¤ont and Martimort (Section 7.1.3, 1999) analyze a moral hazard model with adverse selection. Even
with only two levels of e¤ort, the analysis and formulas (written in terms of primitives) are complex.
15
In practice, horizonal equity considerations appear to prevent the government from using pre-existing public
information such as height, age, family background, or education for tax or redistribution purposes.

and wages (wk ) across the K groups. Let covk (u0 ; w) = u0 (w wk )fk (n)dn denote the
covariance between u0 and w within group k.

Finally, in the case where private insurance

does not generate moral hazard, it has the same lump-sum and loading factor design as in
Section 3.3 within each group k.

Equation (17) shows that the welfare gain from government intervention in this more general model consists of two elements: (1) increased insurance within groups, which is captured
22

by parameters analogous to those analyzed in the baseline case, and (2) increased insurance
across groups, which re‡ects the gains from pooling risk across types. In the present model,
(1) only is operative if private insurance is not optimized; if it was, this term would be zero
and only the second term is operative.
When private insurance is optimized, the optimal tax rate follows a modi…ed formula where
individuals in group k are treated as a single individual with marginal utility and earnings
equal to the average in group k.

Intuitively, private insurance takes care of within group

insurance as well as the government could. Therefore, the government should focus solely on
redistribution across groups, which cannot be insured by the private sector because of preexisting information.

Finally, (19) shows that the government can again ignore “informal”

private insurance that does not general moral hazard and apply the standard optimal tax
formula.

This alternative representation of (17) has exactly the same form as equation (9) obtained in
Section 2, which allowed for non-optimized private insurance but did not explicitly model market failures. This result shows that the baseline formula holds in the model with pre-existing
information, provided that the tax rate and crowdout parameter are measured appropriately.16

4.2

Adverse Selection

Now suppose that each individual knows which group he belongs to before signing insurance
contracts, but insurers do not have this information. This model is an extension of the classic
adverse selection models proposed by Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) and Wilson (1977). If
private insurers were to o¤er a menu of competitive insurance contracts with insurance rates
(t1 ; ::; tM ), individuals in group k would self-select the insurance rate that yields the highest
expected utility and private insurers would make negative pro…ts. Hence, private insurers are
forced to adjust contracts to respect incentive compatibility constraints. A strong equilibrium
is de…ned as a set of contracts such that no …rm can make positive pro…ts by o¤ering a new
insurance contract. When such strong equilibria exist, they are always separating in the sense
that each group k selects a single and speci…c insurance rate tk (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976).
When such strong equilibria do not exist, it is necessary to weaken the concept of equilibrium
to obtain existence of an equilibrium (Wilson 1977).
Here, we restrict attention to the region of the parameter space where an equilibrium exists.
In this equilibrium, each group k is o¤ered private insurance at tax rate tk . The tk can be
common across some groups if there is partial pooling. Furthermore the tk depend on the
government tax rate . Assume that the tk are smooth functions of

so that crowdout rates

rk are well de…ned and welfare gains are smooth.17 The revelation principle implies that in
equilibrium each individual will truthfully reveal his type k. Hence, the equilibrium in this
model can be viewed as a special case of the pre-existing information model analyzed above,
where private insurance contracts were set arbitrarily. It follows that the general formula (17)
in Proposition 3.1 and the alternative representation in (20) hold in this environment.
16
Implementing (20) exactly would require knowledge about the structure of the groups and private insurance
contracts to measure t^ and r^. The measurement of the amount of private insurance is complicated in tax models
because it requires knowledge of marginal products. In social insurance applications, the amount of private
insurance can be measured directly because there are explicit transfers.
17
In cases with multiple equilibria, this assumption requires that the allocation never jumps across equilibria
following a small change in .

24

Adverse selection does, however, a¤ect the formula with optimized private insurance (18)
because it distorts the provision of private insurance within groups. This leads to a violation
of the within-group private insurance optimality condition tk =

covk (w=wk ; u0 =u0k )="k . To

obtain further intuition, rewrite (17) as:

1

pk (1

u0 w

(21)

where tk is the optimal private insurance rate in the absence of adverse selection constraints.
There are two components in (21). The …rst term re‡ects the value of redistribution across
the groups, as in (18). The second term re‡ects the value of …xing the distortions created by
adverse selection within each group. Typically, adverse selection leads to under-provision of
private insurance: tk < tk (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976). Hence, there is value to increasing
within-group redistribution even if private contracts are optimized in the presence of adverse
selection.
More generally, (21) implies that the government tax rate

should be higher than in

the case with no adverse selection (18) because it …xes two market failures rather than one.
This e¤ect is captured in the general formula in (20) with non-optimized private insurance
contracts, because one would observe a higher absolute value of cov(w; u0 ) if adverse selection
were to limit the degree of private insurance. Intuitively, the reason that private insurance is
under-provided in equilibrium –be it adverse selection, pre-existing information, or imperfect
optimization – does not matter when measuring the welfare gains of private insurance in the
class of models we have analyzed. Since (20) has the same form as (9) up to the weighting of
t and r, we conclude that (9) and (8) can be used to obtain simple approximate measures of
the welfare gains from government intervention with endogenous private insurance.

Empirical Applications

In this section, we apply the formulas derived above to analyze the welfare gains from social
insurance.

To do so, we …rst present an alternative representation of the formula for the

marginal welfare gain from government insurance written in terms of the parameters estimated
in empirical studies of social insurance.

5.1

Welfare Gain from Social Insurance

The moral hazard model with two states (zL ; zH ) is isomorphic to standard social insurance
models (e.g. Baily 1978), where the low state is interpreted as a negative shock such as job loss
or illness. In the social insurance literature, contracts are characterized by a bene…t B paid to
the individual in the low state and a premium T that the individual pays to the insurer in the
high state. Since the insurer’s break-even constraint is T = (1

e) B=e, the consumption

levels are a function of the single parameter B:
1

cH = zH

e
e

B, cL = zL + B.

Individual e¤ort e is a function of the bene…t level B.

The second-best optimal contract

chooses B to maximize
W = e u(zH

1

e
e

B) + (1

e )u(zL + B)

(e ).

(22)

This problem is equivalent to the optimal taxation problem in (1) because any tax contract m
can be mapped to an equivalent social insurance contract B by setting B = (z

zL )m. The

only di¤erence between the models is that they use di¤erent notation to describe the contracts.
Let "1

e;B

denote the elasticity of the probability of the low state (1

e ) with respect to

B. The government sets an insurance bene…t level b …nanced by a premium

= b(1

and the private insurer sets a bene…t level bp …nanced by a premium

e)=e. E¤ort

e depends on total bene…t B = b + bp .

p

= bp (1

e)=e

The private insurance bene…t level bp depends on

the government bene…t b according to a function bp (b).

Because the bene…ts are additive

rather than multiplicative, it is convenient to de…ne the crowdout parameter as r =

dbp
db

in

the social insurance scenario. With endogenous private insurance, the government chooses b
to maximize
W = e u(zH

QED.
The …rst term in 24) measures the gap in marginal utilities across the two states, which
captures the marginal value of insurance. The second term captures the cost of insurance
through the behavioral response. Analogous to the tax scenario, private insurance ampli…es
the second term and makes

dW

smaller through two channels: the crowdout e¤ect 1

r in the

denominator and the mechanical e¤ect bp =b in the numerator. The crowdout term re‡ects a
rescaling to recover the fundamental elasticity "1

e;B

and the bp =b term re‡ects the reduction

in b required to achieve the optimal level of B.

The same formula holds (with appropriate

measures of aggregate crowdout and private insurance) a model that permits pre-existing
information and adverse selection, as in section 4.
The expressions for

dW
db

and

dW
d

derived above all measure the marginal welfare gain of

changing taxes and social insurance bene…ts in utils.

To convert these expressions into an

interpretable money metric, we normalize the welfare gain from a $1 (balanced budget) increase
in the size of the insurance program by the welfare gain from raising the wage bill in the high
state by $1. In particular, de…ne

We now apply (26) to characterize the welfare gains from increasing unemployment and health
insurance bene…ts. These calibrations are intended primarily to illustrate the potential impacts of endogenous private insurance on calculations of welfare gains from government intervention rather than for policy analysis. These simple calculations do not account for all
margins of behavioral responses and for heterogeneity across individuals.

5.2

Application 1: Unemployment Insurance

The existing literature on optimal unemployment insurance essentially ignores the existence
of private insurance. Much of private insurance against unemployment is provided through
27

informal risk sharing that is unlikely to generate much moral hazard, and hence can be ignored
in the calculation of optimal bene…ts according to the results in section 3.3. However, many
private …rms provide unemployment insurance in the form of severance payments – lump
sum cash grants made by …rms to workers who are laid o¤.

Unlike government-provided

unemployment bene…ts, severance pay does not distort job search behavior after job loss
because it does not a¤ect marginal incentives to search. Severance pay can, however, distort
e¤ort choices while working by changing the relative price of being unemployed relative to
having a job.
In this section, we calibrate the welfare gain from raising the UI bene…t level when the
response of severance pay to UI bene…ts is taken into account.

To adapt the optimal UI

problem to our static framework above, we ignore the job search decision, treating search
e¤ort after job loss as invariant to the UI bene…t level. Instead, we focus on the distortion in
the probability of job loss (e.g. due to shirking) caused by UI bene…ts and severance pay. In
our static model, both UI bene…ts and severance pay act as transfers to the unemployed state,
and are …nanced by taxes in the employed state.18
Estimation of Crowdout Elasticity. As an illustration of the data and empirical strategy
needed to implement our formula with endogenous private insurance, we begin by estimating
the two key parameters – the size of the private insurance market (bp =b) and the crowdout
e¤ect (r). To do so, we use data on severance pay from a survey conducted by Mathematica
on behalf of the Department of Labor.

The dataset (publicly available from the Upjohn

Institute) is a sample of unemployment durations in 25 states in 1998 that oversamples UI
exhaustees.

We reweight the data using the sampling weights to obtain estimates for a

representative sample of job losers.

The dataset contains information on unemployment

durations, demographic characteristics, and an indicator for receipt of severance pay. There
are 3,395 individuals in the sample, of whom 508 report receiving a severance payment. See
Chetty (2008a) for further details on the dataset and sample construction. We obtain data
on mean unemployment bene…ts by state in 1998 from the Department of Labor.
To calculate bp =b, …rst note that 15% of job losers report receiving severance pay in our
data.

According to calculations reported in Chetty (2008a), the mean severance payment

18
A more precise calibration would take account of the fact that UI bene…ts are conditioned on duration, and
thus are larger when a worse “state” is realized. This calibration would require separate estimates of the e¤ect
of UI bene…ts and severance pay on the probability of job loss.

28

conditional on receipt of severance pay is equal to 10.7 weeks of wages, the mean UI bene…t
level is 50% of the wage, and the mean unemployment duration is 15.8 weeks. Hence, in the
aggregate population, the ratio of total private insurance to total public insurance is
bp
0:15 10:7
=
= 0:20:
b
0:5 15:8
To estimate r – the e¤ect of an increase in the UI bene…t level on severance pay – we
exploit variation in UI bene…t levels across states. Most states pay a …xed wage replacement
rate up to a maximum, which varies considerably across states and thereby creates variation in
UI bene…t levels. The maximum bene…t can be viewed as an instrument for individual bene…t
levels (Meyer 1990). We do not exploit the variation in bene…t levels across individuals within
a state because of endogeneity concerns. Although state bene…t maximums are exogenous to
individual characteristics, they are not orthogonal to all aspects of the economic environment.
In particular, richer states (or those with a higher cost of living) provide both more public and
private insurance. As a result, both state unemployment bene…t maximums and the fraction
of individuals receiving severance pay are positively correlated with mean wage rates in each
state. To account for this confounding factor, we control for wages throughout our analysis
using a ‡exible 10 piece spline for the individual log wage.
We begin with a simple graphical analysis to illustrate our estimation of the crowdout e¤ect.
Figure 1 plots the relationship between average severance pay receipt and the maximum UI
bene…t level, conditioning on wages. To construct this …gure, we …rst regress the severance
pay dummy on the wage spline and the maximum UI bene…t level on the wage spline and
compute residuals. We then compute mean residuals of both variables by state. The …gure
is a scatter plot of the mean residuals. We exclude states that have fewer than 50 individuals
from this …gure to reduce the in‡uence of outliers on the graph; all observations are included in
the regression analysis below. The …gure shows that states with higher UI bene…t levels have
fewer severance payments, indicating that private insurance is crowded out to some extent by
public insurance.
To quantify the amount of crowdout, we estimate a set of regression models of the following
form:
sevi =

+ logbi + f (wi ) + Xi + "i

(27)

where sevi is an indicator for whether individual i received a severance payment, bi is a measure
29

of the UI bene…t level for individual i, f (wi ) denotes the wage spline, and Xi denotes a vector
of additional controls.
Speci…cation 1 of Table 1 reports estimates of (27) without any additional (no X), with bi
equal to the maximum bene…t level in the state where individual i lives. Standard errors in
this and all subsequent speci…cations are clustered by state to adjust for arbitrary within-state
correlation in errors. The estimated coe¢ cient of

=

0:075 implies that a doubling the

UI bene…t maximum would reduce the fraction of individuals receiving severance pay by 7
percent. Speci…cation 2 replicates 1 with the following individual-level covariates: job tenure,
age, gender, household size, education, dropout, industry, occupation, and race dummies.
The point estimate on the UI bene…t level is not a¤ected signi…cantly by the inclusion of these
controls.
Speci…cations 1 and 2 can be interpreted as “reduced form” regressions which show the
e¤ect of the instrument (maximum bene…t levels) on severance pay. To obtain an estimate
of the e¤ect of a $1 increase in the bene…t level on the probability of severance pay receipt,
we estimate a two-stage least squares regression, instrumenting the log individual bene…t level
with the log state maximum. The estimate on the log individual bene…t, reported in column
3 of Table 2, is

=

0:105. Doubling the UI bene…t level would reduce severance receipt by

10.5 percentage points, relative to a mean value of 15%, implying "bp ;b =
that r =

dbp
db

=

b
"bp ;b bp

= 0:7

0:7. We conclude

0:2 = 0:14.

The identi…cation assumption underlying these regressions is that the cross-state variation
in UI bene…t maximums is orthogonal to other determinants of severance pay receipt conditional on wage levels. Most plausible endogeneity stories would work toward attenuating our
estimate of the crowdout e¤ect.

For example, suppose states with higher UI bene…t maxi-

mums are populated by individuals who are more risk averse and therefore place higher value
on insurance. Such states would also have higher private insurance, biasing the correlation
between the UI bene…t level and severance pay receipt upward. Given these concerns about
policy endogeneity, our simple empirical analysis should be viewed as illustrative.

Future

work should exploit within-state variation in UI bene…ts (as in Meyer 1990) to obtain a more
credible and precise estimate of the crowdout e¤ect.
Calibration.

We now use the estimates above in conjunction with other estimates from

the existing literature to calibrate the welfare gain from raising the UI bene…t level. Using
30

the normalization in (25) and the formula for

in (24), the welfare gain from increasing

total government expenditure on unemployment insurance by $1 ( dW

crowdout is taken into account. In contrast, if we were to apply a formula that does not take

Hence, an analyst who ignores crowdout would conclude that the welfare gain from raising
the UI bene…t level is negative only if "1

durations). We conclude that in this application, there is a signi…cant but modest range of
parameters for which adjusting the formula for endogenous private insurance leads to di¤erent
policy implications.

Application 2: Health Insurance

A Model of Health Shocks. We adapt our two-state analysis of social insurance to the case
of health insurance using an extensive-margin model of health consumption.

Suppose that

purchasing health care costs $C. There is a continuum of agents in the economy who di¤er
only in their valuation of health care. Agent i gets a bene…t from health care equivalent to vi
utils. Hence an agent buys health care i¤
vi > u(w

Valuation of healthcare vi is distributed according to a cdf F . The fraction of agents who
buy health care is

Note that v 0

in s and v 0 (:) is decreasing in s so that v(:) is concave. Aggregating over the agents yields the
following social welfare function:
W = (1

s)u(w

p)

+ su(w

C + b + bp ) + v(s)

The fraction of agents who consume health care s is e¤ectively chosen to maximize W , taking
the government and private insurance contracts as given. Since v is increasing and concave,
this problem has the same structure as that analyzed in section 2, with e replaced by 1
and

(e) replaced by

s

v(s). Applying (24) immediately yields the following formula for the

aggregate utility gain from raising the public health insurance bene…t level b by $1:

G(b) = (0:384

) = 0:28
0:9

Taking crowdout into account lowers the estimate of G(b) by a factor of more than 100. An
analyst who ignored crowdout and applied existing formulas (e.g. Chetty 2006a) would infer
that a $100 million expansion in public health insurance programs would, loosely speaking,
generate $28 million in surplus net of the requisite tax increases. This analyst would mistakenly conclude that substantial expansions in the overall level of public health insurance are
desirable. Taking crowdout into account implies that we are near the optimum in terms of
aggregate public health insurance levels, as a $100 million across-the-board expansion would
generate only $0.17 million in net social surplus.
There are several important caveats to this calibration that should be kept in mind when
evaluating the policy implications of this simple calibration. First, this calculation does not
fully account for adverse selection, as it neglects the bene…ts of redistributing across preexisting risk types via government insurance re‡ected in the …rst term of (21).

Second,

the calibration ignores the correlation between health shocks and income inequality, which
33

could potentially increase the welfare gains from health insurance (Cremer and Pestieau 1996).
Third, private health insurance bene…ts are already tax subsidized in the United States, an
issue that we have neglected in the calculation above. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
our aggregate welfare gain calculation ignores substantial heterogeneity across types of people,
conditions, Medicare vs. Medicaid, etc.

For some subgroups, such as the uninsured, there

could clearly be substantial welfare gains from increasing public insurance bene…ts whereas for
others there could be substantial welfare gains from cutting bene…ts. Equation (28) should be
applied with group-speci…c estimates of the inputs to identify how government health insurance
expenditures should be restructured to maximize welfare.

Conclusion

This paper has characterized the welfare gain from public insurance in the presence of endogenous private insurance. The formulas for optimal tax and social insurance policies derived here
highlight two general parameters as the determinants of how private insurance impacts the
welfare gains from social insurance: (1) the size of the formal private insurance market and (2)
the crowdout of formal private insurance by public insurance. Like recent “su¢ cient statistic”
formulas for welfare analysis, the formulas we have derived can be implemented using reducedform empirical evidence without full identi…cation of the model’s primitives. However, unlike
existing su¢ cient statistic formulas, we cannot make strong claims about the robustness of our
formulas because they have been derived in stylized models. While experience with earlier suf…cient statistic formulas suggests that the results may generalize (Chetty 2008b), an important
di¤erence in models with endogenous private insurance is that the envelope conditions that
underlie the robustness of previous formulas may not hold when the private sector outcome
is constrained ine¢ cient. Thus, the source of the deviation from constrained e¢ ciency –e.g.
asymmetric information, imperfect optimization, or administrative costs – could potentially
a¤ect the formula. We believe that the parameters we have identi…ed are likely to be relevant
in more general models, but other factors may also prove be relevant.
We see three major directions for generalization of our analysis. First, one should characterize the e¤ects of government intervention on the equilibria in the adverse selection model,
as in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) and Wilson (1977).

34

We have implicitly assumed that

contracts and behavior will respond smoothly to changes in government policies, but in a
setting with multiple equilibria, there could be jumps between equilibria that would invalidate our formula.

Second, it would be useful to extend the analysis to allow for di¤erent

loading factors for private and public insurance, microfounded via increasing returns or wasteful marketing costs.

Conversely, one could allow for di¤erent levels of e¢ ciency, re‡ecting

the possibility that private insurers could be more e¢ cient because of competitive pressure.
Finally, in the simple model we analyzed here, the best policy is simply to rule out formal
private insurance and have the government provide all insurance. However, there are some
areas in which private insurers have an informational advantage relative to the government.
For instance, employers have more information on e¤ort on the job, making the moral hazard
problem smaller for the employer. Characterizing the optimal mix of government and private
insurance is an important next step.
If government and private insurers optimize along the lines described by our analysis, our
model makes testable predictions about the pattern of insurance contracts we should observe.
For instance, private insurance should be more prevalent in economies with low job mobility
(such as Japan), where …rms have the ability to insure shocks through a compressed wage
structure without facing as much adverse selection. Another prediction is that government
insurance should be more prevalent for shocks that occur prior to the point at which insurance
contracts can be purchased, such as disability at birth, or for shocks where optimization of
insurance purchases is unlikely.

It would be valuable to test empirically whether observed

contracts deviate systematically from these theoretical prescriptions.

NOTE–Figure plots relationship between fraction of individuals receiving severance pay
in each state vs. maximum state UI benefit level, conditioning on wages. Figure shows
a scatter plot of the mean residuals by state from a regression of severance pay receipt
and log maximum weekly benefit level on a log wage spline (see text for details). Data
source: Mathmetica survey of UI Exhaustees in 25 States in 1998. States with fewer
than 50 individual observations are excluded from this figure.
