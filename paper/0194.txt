C(T-BENEFIT ANALYSIS UNDER UNCERTAINTY

Daniel A. Graham

I.

Introduction

The implications of uncertainty for cost-benefit analysis remain con-

troversial. Two related problems are the subject of this analysis. First,
for any given future period a dollar magnitude must be identified which
appropriately

represents the value of the uncertain benefits (costs) to

accrue in that

year.

Second, an appropriate discount rate for converting

this future value into present value must

be

identified.

For illustrative purposes consider a simple problem. The construction
of a dam

wet

is

being considered. Potential benefits include flood control in

years and the

years. A standard
approach to determining the value of this darn employs the probabilities of
provision of irrigation water in dry

wet and dry years together with the value of benefits to accrue under each
circumstance to calculate the expected value (mathematical expectation)
of benefits in each year. Thus, for exarnile, if there were two possible
states of nature within a given year——"wet" and "dry" with probabilities

.7 and .3 respectively, and if a particular farmer were willing to pay up
to $50 for the darn if a wet year were certain and up to $100 if a dry year
were

certain, then $65 would be counted as the value of benefits accruing

to the farmer in the given year. Adding across affected individuals would
then yield the total benefit for the year.
Having obtained a measure of the total value of the darn within each

year, the standard approach then involves discounting these

benefits to

—2—

obtain

the present value, with the discount rates to be selected so as to

appropriately reflect the riskiness of the benefits. Needless to say,
there

has been

considerable controversy

regarding the appropriate dis-

count rate.1

In addition to the debate regarding the discount rate there has
recently surfaced a second controversy regarding the use of expected

value as a measure of benefit within a period. If the farmer in the
example were willing to pay $50 for the

maximum sure payment that he would be willing to make in both states?
Following

to

Burton Weisbrod

(1964) the term "option price" has been used

describe this maximum sure payment. Millard Long (1967) asserted

that option price is nothing more than the expected value of surplus or

$65 in our example. Cotton Lindsay (1969) disagreed and Charles J.
Cicchetti and A. Myrick Freeman III (1971) and then John Krutilla et al
(1972) argued that option price should generally exceed the expected

value

of surplus so that

for the period? To what extent does the answer to this question

affect the choice of the appropriate discount rate?
In

what follows we provide a

determining

conceptually correct procedure for

whether a risky project passes the "potential Pareto

improvement" welfare criterion which forms the normative basis of

cost—

benefit analysis. In this approach the role of secondary markets in
providing opportunities for redistributing risk is made transparent and
the modifications

necessary when such markets do not exist are suggested.

Some of the more interesting results include:
(1)

Option price is the appropriate measure of benefit in
situations involving similar individuals and collective

risk.
(2) Expected value calculations are

to situations
involving similar individuals and individual risks.
appropriate

(3) Whether or not option price exceeds the expected value of
surplus is largely irrelevant to the evaluation of risky

projects.
(4) In a wide range of circumstances,

including incomplete

markets, discounting for risky projects should be done
at the riskiess rate.

Precise relationships among the surplus, certainty and fair bet points are
developed in an appendix; here it is sufficient to point out that in general these are distinct points along the willingness to pay locus.

3. ption Value
The willingness to pay locus can

be

used to indicate the factors

determining whether option value (equation (4)] is positive or negative.

The possibilities are illustrated in Figures 2a—c.

Figure 2a is charac-

terized by the fact that the fair bet point lies to the right of the 45°

line. Since the slope of the locus at this point gives the relative
probability of "wet" versus "dry," a parallel through

point. Where this line crosses the 450 line payments are equal in
states and thus also equal to the expected value of surplus. Here

option price necessarily exceeds the expected value of surplus
option

and thus

value is positive.

In Figure 2b the fair bet point lies to the left of the surplus point

and

a similar

construction reveals that, in this case, the expected value

of surplus must exceed option price yielding a negative option value.
The third case illustrated in Figure 2c is characterized by the fair
bet point lying between the 45° line and the surplus point.

Here there

is ambiguity: option price may be greater or less than the expected value
of surplus.

4. The Potential Pareto Irthrovement Test
Figures 2a—2c not only summarize the considerations affecting the
sign of option value, they also suggest that there may be little to
recommend either option price or expected surplus for a role of prominence

in cost—benefit analysis. They are, after all, only two

arbitrarily se-

lected points

along the willingness to pay locus and have no obvious claim

to preference

over other points along the locus including the fair bet and

certainty points. The question to be resolved ultimately is whether or
not there exist payments for each individual which, when

aggregated,

yield

sufficient resources to build the dam and which, when coupled with the
provision of the dam, leave no individual worse

It remains

to

determine whether option price or expected value cal-

first a special case in which (1) the resource cost of the dam is certain

claims. Here we are concerned with the intersection of the aggregate
locus with the 45° line (point V in Figure 4) since this point represents
the largest possible sure payment. But with all individuals alike this

Thus there exist circumstances in which option price is the

The second type of special case to be considered

involves the concept

"individual risks" discussed by Nalinvaud (1973). The dam problem in-

volves a "collective risk" since everyone will experience the state "wet"

or everyone will experience the state "dry." Consider an alternative
situation based upon an example from Schmalensee (1972). Here an individ-

ual can be in one of two "individual states." In the first he will have
"a strong desire" to go to Yellowstone Park next. summer. In the second

he will have no desire to go. What is different about this situation is
that it is possible for one person to experience "individual state 1"
while another experiences "individual state 2."
It is possible, of course, to place this problem within the original
framework by identifying states of nature according to the experience of

each individual. Thus "state 1" might correspond to the situation in which
each of the N members of society experiences "individual state 1."
Similarly,

"state 2"

For simplicity suppose that N is large and that the probability

will experience the alternative individual states, the fates of particular individuals are uncertain.6 For any given person we simply

suppose that the probability that he will be in "individual state 1"
is .3 while the probability of "individual state 2" is .7. The
willingness to pay locus of a representative individual is illustrated in

Figure 5. The surplus point S indicates that the individual would be
willing to pay up to $100 above the costs of the trip for a visit to
Yellowstone if he were certain of "individual state 1" and nothing if

"individual state 2" were certain. This yields an expected surplus

of

$30.

it is possible to collect an aggregate sure payment equal to N times
expected value of the fair bet point. Since no larger sure payment

possible, the&. fair bet point may, in these circumstances, be identified
as the one appropriate to cost-benefit analysis. Alternatively, the exis

pected value of the fair bet point is the appropriate measure of benefit.
This special case is an illustration of a more general proposition
developed by Malirwaud (1973) which indicates circumstances in which
equilibrium prices for contingent dollar claims against alternative states

tend

to be

equal to the probabilities of the states. The simplified pro-

cedure followed in this case is made possible, in essence, by the knowledge
that prices equal to the probabilities of the individual states will yield

an efficient distribution of risk. Reference to Figure 5 indicates that
this case is further characterized by the fact that the expected value of
surplus, $30, is greater than option price and, therefore, option value

— 16 —

is

negative. It would obviously be easy to illustrate a case in which

option value is positive simply by drawing the willingness to pay locus

so that it crosses the 45° line above $30. The sign

of

option value is,

however, irrelevant. If expected values are relevant at all, i.e., if
the situation involves individual—insurable risks, then the expected

of the fair bet point is the largest of all points along the locus
and is, therefore, the appropriate measure of benefit. If the situation
value

does

not involve individual—insurable risks then prices which support an

efficient allocation of contingent claims will not in general be equal
to probabilities and expected values have no bearing upon the appropriate
"market price" value.7

To restate, if individuals are alike then option price measures
benefit in cases of collective risk while expected willingness to pay
(the expected value of the fair

of

bet point) measures benefit in cases

individual-insurable risks.

of option price and the expected value of surplus may, of
course, be used as lower bounds for the expected value of the fair bet
point. It should be noted in this regard that an estimate of consumer
surplus (the Hicksian compensating variation) derived from demand data
for Yellowstone visitors would ideally estimate the expected value of
surplus. To see this note that since .3N individuals visit the park
each period with each having a surplus of $100, one would obtain $30N,

the aggregate expected value of surplus, from an ideal "area under the
demand curve" type calculation. Since this measure is a lower bound
for the true value Krutilla et al (1972) were correct in their
suspicion that expected surplus understates the true benefit.

do not exist.8 It is crucial in such circumstances that either (1) the
particular method

of financing

the project be evaluated with respect to

its implications for the distribution of risk or (2) the analysis be
modified in such a way as to avoid dependence on non-existing

markets.

8There are at least two important reasons why many types of contingent
claims markets do not exist. The first is moral hazard: a person buying

claims

contingent uton a particular state may have incentives to alter
his behavior in a way that is adverse to the seller. Second, such markets require complicated and specialized contracts which may be costly
both to write and to enforce.

— 19 —

The problem can

be

put rather simply. The magnitude

corresponding

to C

in Figure 6 represents society's willingness to pay for two things:
the project itself and

(1)

(2) an efficient allocation of risk. If the

method of financing the project yields an efficient allocation it is

legitimate to use C as a measure of total benefit. If, on the other
hand, the financing scheme does not produce efficiency then collecting

The modifications required to introduce time into the analysis are

91t might be thought that state—dependent collections represent an unrealistic method of financing projects. This is not necessarily true,
however. In the case of the darn, for example, a combination of sure
taxes and water charges might produce exactly the combination of contingent
payments required for allocational efficiency. Sure taxes and
charges might similarly be used in the case of Yellowstone Park. In Figure
5 a sure tax of Ob in both states plus a visitor charge of Oa—Ob would produce
exactly the desired result. In general, however, the same factors that
prevent contingent claims markets from being privately organized would pre—
sably inhibit the use of state—dependent collection schemes.

there is no uncertainty regarding the first period. The first

good, dollars, may now

be

taken

to

form three elementary commodities:

(1) sure dollars for consumption during the first period, (2) dollars
for consumption in the second period contingent upon the occurence of
"wet"

and (3) second period dollars contingent upon "dry." Supposing

the individual to have a utility function representing his preferences
for consumption programs involving these three goods and the proposed

dam and supposing that he is endowed with claims against the three
types of state/time

ness

dependent dollars, we may illustrate his willing-

to pay locus in Figure 7.

By

aggregating these loci across individuals in the manner sug-

gested earlier one obtains the aggregate willingness to pay locus. As
before the project is justifiable if the vector describing its resource

costs lies below this aggregate surface. If, for example, all costs
are to be incurred during the first period then the relevant measure
of benefit is the intersection of the

competitive markets exist for the three types of dollar claims

(2) the method of financing the project involves time and

ent payments compatible with an efficient allocation. In either case
discounting is done implicitly at a riskiess rate. This may be shown

as

follows. At the payments points associated with an efficient collec-

tion scheme the marginal rate of substitution between any two

types

of

dollars is the same for all individuals. Thus relative "shadow prices"
for the three types of dollars are

determined.

solve

uniquely for p and as the prices (in terms of sure period 1 dol—

Second best considerations remain crucial in the temporal case. A
method appropriate to cases of incomplete markets and sure collection

suppose

that a market exists in which individuals can exchange

dollars

and sure period two dollars. On the other hand, no markets for

trade in claims contingent upon the occurence of "wet" or "dry" exist.
Although the individual depicted in Figure 7 is prepared to make any of
the payments combinations along his willingness to pay surface the
available market only allows payments lying within the plane determined
by the "$

this incomplete market case and is reproduced in Figure 8. Once again

upon which state is preferable.) Thus R represents a measure of the ex-
