A MODEL OF TRADE AND EXChANGE RATE PROJECTIONS

ABSTRACT

This paper develops and applies a model of world trade and
exchange rates to analyze dynamic interaction of the current account and

exchange rate. The model is designed to concentrate on the determination
of trade flows, prices and exchange rates for the OECD member countries
but it also covers oil exporting countries, other developing countries
and Centrally Planned Economies.
The model contains exchange rate equations, based on the asset
market approach, for major OECI) countries and

adjustable

pegging rules

These provide the link

for small OECD countries and for non—oil LDOs.

from asset accumulation through the current account to the exchange rate.

With the integration of exchange rate equations into the trade model, it
can be used to analyze outcomes of different exchange rate regimes and

alternative growth prospects in the OECD area.
Simulation results indicate that the model produces a smooth and

slow adjustment process for exchange rates and current accounts. They
also show that with the higher growth target for an individual country
large current account deficits may occur or large changes in real exchange
rates are needed to reach the external equilibrium.

Introduction
This paper develops and applies a model of world trade and exchange

rates to analyze dynamic interaction of the current account and exchange rate.
The model is designed to concentrate on the determination of trade flows,
prices and exchange rates for the OECD member countries but It also covers oil
exporting countries, other developing countries and Centrally Planned Economies.
The model contains exchange rate equations, based on the asset market
approach, for major OECD countries and adjustable pegging rules for small OECD

countries and for non—oil LDCs. These provide the link from asset accumulation
through the current account to the exchange rate. With the integration of
exchange rate equations into the trade model, it can be used to analyze outcomes
of different exchange rate regimes and alternative growth prospects in the
OECD area.

Simulation results indicate that the model produces a smooth and slow

adjustment process for exchange rates and current accounts. They also show that
with the higher growth target for an individual country large current account
deficits may occur or large changes in real exchange rates are needed to

reach

the external equilibrium.
It must be, however, emphasized that the projected changes in market

shares and exchange rates reflect the growth assumptions and the introduction
of

different exchange rate regimes as well as historical income and price

elasticities

in international trade. That is why they are conditional and

should not be interpreted as forecasts of future develpments of trade flows and
exchange rates.

The paths for potential and actual GDP in the OECD countries are generated
by a small model which projects output based on growth in productivity and
labor force and which projects investment requirements for ten major OECO countries.

—2—

Table 1 illustrates a few results of a model simulation. For this
run the growth rate of actual German GD? was increased by on percentage point

for the 15—year run. Germany, of course, runs a larger current account deficit
and its exchange rate depreciates and its inflation rate increases. Strong
effects are seen for the other European countries: all appreciate and experience
reduced inflation rates. While the smaller countries gain market shares and

improve their current accounts, the larger countries lose market shares and
have worsened current accounts. The non—European countries are little affected.
The macro model for each country takes as inputs the following time

series; male and female working age population, level of armed forces, full
employment" level of the unemployment rate, sector—specific equilibrium capital—

output ratio, depreciation rates, and shares of total output. Using these time
series as inputs into a small econometric model for each country, levels of gross
domestic product, employment, capital stocks and investment requirements by

sector are generated for the 1976 to 1990 period. Different projections may be
made by either altering the time series inputs or by providing different values
for the parameter estimates used in the equations.

The international model determines equilibrium trade flows, prices, and

exchange rates for the 26 regions. The GDP results from the individual macro
models are used as inputs into import—demand equations for three types of

traded goods: non—oil merchandise, oil, and non—factor services. Import
demand in each category is a function of domestic GD?, the import price, and
the domestic GD? deflator.

Thw GD? deflator depends on an exogenously—specified production—cost

index and import prices. Export prices are a function of the domestic price

as well as all other export prices. The import prices are determined by a
trade—weighted average of export prices, and the exchange rate.
Bilateral

trade flows are determined by import demands and a bilateral

import—share matrix. The share matrix is adjusted every period to reflect
changes

in

relative export prices and exchange rates.

Several options for exchange rate determination are built into the model.
The first is to allow exchange rates to adjust to give Balance of Payments

flow—equilibrium for all regions. The second option is for fixed exchange rates;
treating changes in international reserves as a residual item to balance each

region's international payments. The third option is to solve for major
countries dollar exchange rate from empirical asset market equation. Then the
payments are balanced by additions to or subtractions from the region's net

foreign assets. Countries for which the exchange rate equations have been
estimated are Canada, France, Germany (Federal Republic), Italy, Japan, and the

U.K. The small countries exchanged rates are either fixed (OPEC, the LDC's, and
the Centrally—Planned Region) or are determined by a rule which pegs each region's
currency to a weighted average of its trading partner's currencies.

The remainder of the paper is divided into three parts. Section II explains
the simple procedure used to project growth in real and potential output.
Section III covers projections for investment requirements in ten major OECD

countries. Section IV gives a brief explanation of the trade and exchange rate
model and presents results from several simulations.

II. Projections
Potential output projections were performed for twenty—one OECD nations.1

Employment
The labor force is equal to the level of working age population multiplied

by the participation rate. From this value a constant level of armed forces
is subtracted to arrive at the civilian labor force.

For each country, a "potential" or "full—employment" unemployment rate is

used to arrive at potential employment. These potential unemployment rates are
drawn from INTERFtJTURES internal studies. Table 3 displays the assumed potential
unemployment rates and

Productivity
Historical trend growth rates of output per man—year was taken from
estimates of simple labor—demand equations for the twenty countries.

regressions

were run

using

These

data from 1960 through 1975. Due to the very

simple specification of the labor—demand equation, the estimated growth rate
of output per man year includes both a measure of technical progress and any
trend in the wage/rent ratio.

For 1975 to 1980, the trend value was used to calculate potential

productivity. For the remaining years, the growth rates were changed to
represent a convergence of OECD productivity levels and growth rates.

We

assumed that productivity levels would not surpass those of the U.S. and that
the productivity rate of growth would equal that of the U.S. when the levels

were equal. For each country, we assumed that the convergence would occur
between the year 2000 (for Japan) and 2025 (for the lowest productivity countries).

These assumptions imply the path of productivity growth rates given in Table

4 (See page 8). The low productivity countries will have high rates of growth
and conversely for the high—productivity countries.

Potential Output
Potential output is equal to full—employment times the level of potential

productivity. The projected growth rates are shown in Table 5. (See page g).
The rates of growth for Austria, the Netherlands, and Portugal seem implausibly

high. The implausibility lies in the paths of productivity growth rate assumed
for each.

Reaching Potential Output

As of 1978, none of the twenty countries were at potential output. Moat
of the countries have unemployment rates higher than the "full—employment" level

(See page 10) displays the 1978 ratios of actual to potential

for both productivity and employment in the first two columns. The third
column contains the percentage shortfall

of actual from potential GDP in 1978.

The final column gives the average growth rate

of GDP from 1978 to 1990. Note

that the required growth rates are very high for several countries; especially
Austria, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.

This may point out the unreason-

ableness of the assumed productivity growth paths.

It is also of interest that

the shortfall of GDP from potential is almost entirely due to a shortfall in
productivity: the shortfall in employment plays a relatively minor role.

III, Investment Projections

III. A. Countries and Sectors
This section presents a simple quantitative framework for analysis and projections of fixed investment needs for a sample of OECD countries consistent with
the output projection described in the previous section. Given the output development, a central question is what level of capital stock and thus which flow of

gross fixed capital information are implied by such growth prospects. We could
not do an all—inclusive study of capital requirements in the OECD area due to the
data problems and time constraint; our intention i to cover eno'gh of the important countries so as to be confident that
policy issues would come to our notice.

in most of the OECD countries the problems In Southern. European labour surplus countries may be different fran the problems of industrialised countries

to allow for different sectoral capital intensities each economy was divided

into four sectors. These are as follows:

Private services (including housing).

and there are large differences between the various sources, we wanted to

provide comparability between countries. Also resources available for the
study did not allow a more careful and refined treatment of the data. Consequently, the data and the projection results are suitable only to evaluate
general trands and directions of changes. Sectoral output data for all coun-

Countries, 1977), an OECD study, 'Measurement of capital (Ward 1976),
and a U.S. growth model (Iiclonan and Coen, 1976). These shoved large

variations between different sources and gave little indication as to
which direction to adjust our estimates.

Depreciation rates (Continued)

Depreciation rate estimates for private service sector including
housing were obtained by weighting together depreciation rates for
private services excluding housing, and the depreciation rate for
housing which was fixed to be 1.5 per cent for all countries except
Italy, and the United Kingdom. For these countries a lower value of
1.0 per cent was used on the basis of the average age estimates of
buildings and structures given in Ward (1976). The relevant weights
are relative capital stock shares

in 1973.

—15—

Value added shares
The projections of the compostion of output were obtained mainly by

extrapolating the past trends. Value—added shares in each economy
were projected up to 1985 and then kept at this level. This is more
or less arbitary, but nevertheless allows us to have some kind of
idea of future capital needs during the recovery period with
structural cahnge.
Projected value-added share changes imply a generalized decrease

in the value-added share of agriculture. Industry's share is increasing
in all countries except in the United States where it is slightly de-

creasing. In general, the projected increase in industry's share is
larger the higher the growth rate of total GDP during the recovery

period. Government's share is assumed to stay more or less constant.

The resi!ua1 item private services — shows a moderate decline in
most of the countries, In the absence of any better information, value
added share projections were applied to generate both potential and
actual sectoral output paths.

III D. Generation of the capital gap at the beginning of 1979

Given the potential GDP projections described in Section II to gen-

erate sectoral full employment capital stocks in each economy. The actual
sectoral capital stock figures at the beginning of 1979 were obtained by
cumulating investment on 1973 stocks allowing far capital retirement using

the sectoral depreciation rates given in Table 8 (See page 14). In the
absence of any quantitiative information, we did not try to take into account

possible increased scrapping proposed on the hypothesis that large shifts in
relative prices after the oil crisis made some of the existing capital obsolete.
Thus, our actual capital stock numbers in this sense can be interpreted to

represent a kind of upper baindary and thus they may underestimate the actual

capital gaps. Sectoral gross investment numbers come from OECD national income
accounts or from OECD Economic Outlook for the period 1973-1978. Where in-

in real terms was not available on sectoral level nominal investment
are applied to split total real fixed investment which was available

The results indicate varations In the extent of the present capital
shortfall across the countries in our sample but also large differences

within each country across sectors. At the aggregate level, the gaps are
insignificant in the cases of Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, and

the United States. At the other end of the list are the Netherlands, with
Sweden falling in between. In the case of Canada, the explanation Is
obviously the increase in energy investment projects. In France, the decline
In

private sector investment was compensated by increasing public Investment

in

electricity, and In Sweden the increase was delayed until 1975 by stimul-

ative fiscal incentives.

—17—

There are good reasons to expect that the housing stock estimate in 1979
is too low due to the high depreciation rate used in the Rand Corporation
Study for housing. This implies that we possibly underestimate the aggregate
capital—output ratio in the service sector including housing which in turn
means a downward bias in capital requirement estimates. In order to have some
idea of the quantitative effects of different capital—output ratios, we
inereased the full employment capital—output ratio in the private—service
sector by 20 per cent and carried out the needed calculations.

The results

show that there is now a capital shortfall in each country. Also, at aggregate
level, increases in the gap vary between two and four percentage points but
in general, the ranking of the countries has not changed. This calculation
indicates that on the basis of the present analysis, it is difficult to
estimate whether at the aggregate level the capital stock in the "boundary
countries" (Belgium, Canada, Prance, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom) is
sufficient fully to utilise the labor force.
At the industry level, there seems to be a capital shortfall in each country.
The relative gap exceeds the limit of ten per cent in all other cases except

Canada, Italy, Sweden and the United States. Japan and the Netherlands are now
the problem countries with capital gaps over 25 per cent. There is one obvious
reason for the differences between gap estimates at the aggregate level and
at the industry level: the inclusion of the housing sector into private services.

III. E. Investment Returns

The estimates of the current capital gap and the growth of full employment
capital stock give a growth path for future capital requirements.

This path

implies a stream of gross fixed tnvestment consistent with it. Table 10 (See
page 17) shows such investment as a percentage of total GDP (in industry's
case investment as a percentage of industry's value added.)

The most critical assumption may be a constant equilibrium capital-

output ratio. As the price of other inputs rise relative to the cost
of capital, the optimum capital-output ratio in production will rise
as

capital is substituted for the other inputs. Since 1973 the relative

price

of energy has risen perhaps fourfold. The relative price of labour

has also risen, especially in the continental European countries. The
increase in relative prices of energy and labour, would increase the

equilibrium capital—output ratios again raising the investment requirements of Table 10.

Moreover,

a number of other factors might call for an upward adjust-

ment of our assumed equilibrium capital-output ratio suchas a shift
towards a relatively greater share of large—scale projects in total
investment activity (energy sector being a

in

prime example), an increase

the share of investment directed to environmental protection, and

-.19—

competition from some fast—growing LDCs leading to potentially faster
rates of structural change, accelerated capital obsolescence and thus

increased full-employment capital output ratios. With this in mind the
investment requirement projections should be interpreted to represent
some kind of minimum alternative consistent with the growth path towards
full employment.
At the aggregate level a slight decrease in the investment share in

Belgim, Canada, France and Japan is projected. For the United States,
the United Kingdom and Italy, there is a minor increase in the investment share. A general conclusion might be that for these countries
capital requirement implies more or less stable investment shares out

of GDP. For Germany, Netherlands arid Sweden the increase in the invest-

share is most striking. In the case of Germany the estimate may
be out of any reasonable projection range. For all countries, the

ment

investment—value added ratios in industry are high historically. In
the projections, the only country with investment requirements in industry not significantly greater in the projections than during 1975-

78 is the United States. In general, simply filling in the shortfall
of investment since 1973 will require

high investment ratios during

the recovery period.
The investment "requirements" of Table 10 are in a sense minimum

estimates, and thus give the most optimistic view of the potential
difficulty with capital formation to 1990. If the size of the capital
gap

has been underestimated, or if events since 1973 have increased

optimal capital-output ratios, then the investment requirements should

be adjusted upwards. There are several reasons to expect that the
Table 10 estimates are, indeed, low.

countries and centrally planned economies • The model covers 26 regions, of
which 23 are members of the OECD. The non—OECD world is covered by the last

three regions. The regions are:

country's balance of payments position.

The model thus allows us to investigate possible balance of payments diff 1—

culties arising from alternative domestic macro projections. Countries can-

not indefinitely maintain large current account deficits or surpluses without
experiencing some change in the exchange rate or an impact on the internal
balance. The model will give indications of such payments pressure on any of
the countries with alternative assumptions of the time paths of exogenous
variables.

—21—

The model is driven by time paths of several macroeconomic variables and

the values of the parameters in the equations forming the model. The list

of variables that control the external sector differ by region. For the
23 OECD regions the main exogenous variable is real CDP. Other exogenous

variables for the OECD regions are net labour incomes, net private transfers from abroad and the initial value of net capital incomes from abroad.
For OPEC, imports of goods and services are exogenous •

Also exogenous are

the small current account items: the net labour incomes and private transfers. The only difference for the Centrally Planned Economies region Is
that net capital flow is the main exogenous variable rather than imports.
The treatment of non—oil LDCe Is roughly similar to that of OECD countries.

Projections with the model can be carried out in several alternative modes.
First, the model could be used to project developments of current account for
each country and region with the assumption of fixed exchange rates • This
alternative means projecting world trade with exogenously projected import
market shares, because there are no endogenous changes in relative prices.
the other hand the model lends itself easily to analysis of a case of
adlustable exchange rates. This approach assumes that exchange rates are
adjusted to maintain some target current account balances, and then calculates the necessary changes under the projection assumptions. The calculations use estimates of trade price elasticities to move the trade share matrix
through time.

The adjustable exchange rate projections are not the same as projections of
what would happen with flexible rates. Recently, the theoretical literature
has turned to the so—called asset market model of flexible exchange—rate
determination in which the key role of the exchange rate is the relative price
of national monies rather than national outputs. In this model, short—run
stability of the foreign exchange market depends on asset substitution, rather
than trade elasticities. This approach has been used to determine the six
key exchange rates and these equations are linked to the trade model. We be-

lieve that it is important to Integrate these on the empirical level In order
to study the dynamic stability of the exchange rate in the long—run because

this is one of the key issues for a flexible exchange rate regime. With this
integration the model can be used to analyse outcomes from choices of different exchange rate regimes.

the paper.

1. Import Equations
In the import side we distinguish between imports of good and services and

petroleum

Imports. In postulating an import demand function for goods and

services we have taken imperfect substitution view of international trade
in which domestic and tradeable goods are sufficiently non—substitutable

In order to generate finite price elasticities: The share of real Imports
of goods and services out of real GDP depends on the relative full employment output gap and relative prices. This type of equation has the property
that in the long—run when the economy is on its full employment output path
income elasticity of imports equal unity and the long—run import /GDP ratio
is constant if relative prices remain unchanged. We have aggregated imports
of goods and services, because very few elasticity estimates for services
are available and because in many cases it is plausible to assume that
services import flows and goods import flows are closely related. This type
of equation is applied to all OECD countries. Petroleum imports are related to real GDP and relative price of petroleum (CDP prices divided by
oil prices) for all importing regions. For non—oil LDCs the volume of imports is decomposed into two parts: an exogenously projected component

—23—

(which is equal to their real GDP growth) and a component which reacts
to changes in LDCa import prices relative to their GDP prices. For
Centrally Planned Economies value of total imports is a residual item
in the current account equation.
2. Export Equat ion
For our export block we have taken a market share approach. Given estimates of each country's imports by equations described above, exports
of each country can be determined through import market share matrices.
The market share approach is applied to the determination of exports of

goods and oil. Services are treated differently, because we do not
have the necessary data for bilateral services flows.
The question is how best to obtain projections for the share matrix, because market shares vary over time due to changes in relative competitiveness which can result from changes in relative prices or other factors
such as export promotion, delivery times etc. In the model Import market
shares of goods are assumed to respond to changes in relative prices and
to relative non—price competitiveness measured by the growth of the exporting country's potential output relative to a weighted average of the
growth of its competitor's potential output, i.e. countries with rapidly
expanding capacity relative to others are assumed to capture markets.
Changes in oil import shares are determined exogenously.

For exports of services we assume that there is a single international
trade pool of services to which all exports are delivered. The relative
change in each country's share depends on the relative change in its
export price relative to the "world price" of services and on the relative
change in its potential GDP relative to a weighted average (service export
shares as weights) of the relative change in its competitors potential CDP.
The relative output terms stands for non-price competitiveness as in the
case of goods market share equation.

—24—

Export Prices

With the assumption of imperfect competition in international markets
the supply function of exports should be specified as some type of price—
setting behaviour. For a small country with no market power in the export
markets, the price of exports would be given in foreign currency. If
the country has some market power its exports prices change less than

competitors' prices or costs of production can be passed to its export
prices to a certain extent. Assuming constant price elasticities of
export supply and demand the relative change in export prices can be
expressed as a weighted average of the relative change in competitors'
price3 and the relative change in a variable measuring domestic cost
developments. We have approximated this cost variable by domestic price
level. This is carried out for later purposes in order to integrate
domestic prices into the model.

Qirrent Account Equation

In order to obtain current account equations for each region, the determination of aid flows, factor Incomes and net private transfers in the
current account are needed • The total amount of aid received by non—oil
LDCa is projected exogenously. The Increase In total aid flow is allocated between donor countries according to constant 1975 shares • Net interest

incomes from abroad are generated as a multiple of "world interest rate,"
exogenous to the model, and cumulated current account of each country.

Other terms in the current account, i.e., net private transfers and net
labor Incomes from abroad are determined exogenously outside the model.

Finally we have a current account equation for each region. For centrally
planned economies current account balance is fixed outside the model and
the value of imports is the adjusting item, i.e., we assume that this
region uses all its foreign currency receipts to buy Imports. All the
building blocks of the model are constructed in a way which automatically
takes into account the world trade balance and current account constraints.

The Effect of Import Prices on the Domestic Price

There

are several

affected

Level

ways through which the domestic price level can be

by international price developments. First, domestic prices

may be changed if there is substitution between tradeable and

domestic-

ally produced goods. Price effects from the tradeable goods sector can

a

also channel through labour markets to the prices of non—tradeable goods.

In

inflationary pressures may happen
through prices of Imported raw materials and petroleum, which calls for a formulation of a cost—push model. Here we limit ourselves only to the latter
approach. Pt this stage we also ignore inflation coming from domestic
developments.!" Thus in the model variation in the domestic price level
comes through changes In import prices of goods and petroleum. It should
be noted here that we have assumed no change in relative prices between
traded final and intermediate goods, and that is why Import price of goods
(excluding oil) serves as a proxy for Import price of raw materials in the
domestic price equation. This naturally means that the model shows only the
inflationary effect of the pressure coming from Import price Increases. Nevertheless, it adds one important link to the model and thus provides a more
plausible approximation of reality than a purely exogenous treabnent of the
domestic price level.
addition, the abosrption of external

work is In progress to capture effects of different money growth rates

Exchange Rate Block

From the early 1970e onwards countries adopted a wide variety of exchange
countries have had more or less floating ex—
rate systems. Major
change rates since 1973 while several small OECD economies and developing

countries chose to peg their currencies to some basket or a single currency)-j

We have tried to capture some basic lines of the present policy-": the
currencies of the big seven OECD countries are floating, smaller OECD
countries and developing countries peg their currencies in an adjustable
way to a trade weighted basket; oil trade and Centrally Planned Economies'
trade with the rest of the world is In dollars. With the integration of

exchange rate equations into trade model, it can be used to analyse outcomes from choices of different exchange rate regimes.
The trade block of the model generates projections for the current account.
The link from the current account to the exchange rate for floaters is
obtained by applying the asset market approach (see e.g. Branson, 1977)
to determine (dollar/local currency) exchange rates for Canada, France
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. With flexible exchange rates
the sun of balances on capital account and current account for these countries is identically zero (central bank foreign reserves stay constant) e If
the current account shows a surplus, the capital account remains in deficit
and the private sector accunulates foreign assets. According to our equations this moves the exchange rates in the short run. Changes in the exchange rates will affect trade flows and change the current account which in
turn moves the exchange rate. In the model, a current account deficit
(surplus) of country i will cause its currency to depreciate (appreciate).
This In turn improves (worsens) the current account •

The long—run dynamic

adjustment thus happens through the interaction of exchange rate equations
and the trade block. The effect of the exchange rate movement on trade
takes time and enough time must pass to bring the current account to zero.
However, In the projections we would not necessarily expect to see balanced
current accounts as exports and imports are moved through growth rates of
GDP which may differ from country to country. Smaller OECD countries and
non—oil LDCs peg their currencies to a trade weighted basket in an adjustable

IV. C. Trade and Exchange Rate Projections
This

section compares three simulations with the trade—exchange rate

model described above. The simulations were designed to illustrate the
flexibility of the model and the type of information it generates.1

Exogenous Inputs
For these simulations it is assumed that GDP follows the path described

in section II for the twenty OECD countries. For Greece, New Zealand, Turkey,
the non—oil LDC's, OPEC, and the CPE's, the GDP growth rate is arbitrarily set.
The aid inflow to the LDC's is taken from World Bank 1976 SIMLINK projections.
The capital inf low to the CPE's declines steadily from its 1976 value to zero

by 1990. The final exogenous time series are the price of oil and OPEC imports.
For these runs we set the oil price index equal to the actual for 1975 through

1979 (as of July 1980) and to the 1979 value for 1981 through 1990. The OPEC
imports are equal to actual from 1975 through 1979 and then increase so that
OPEC has a zero balance on current account by 1990.

The Three Simulations

Three simulations are compared here. First a flexible exchange rate
simulation is compared with a fixed exchange rate simulation. The fixed—rate
simulation is of no interest in itself. It is useful only in that it allows
an illustration of the importance of the flexible—rate model. The third
simulation is a flexible—rate run with an exogenous increase in Germany's

rate of growth of actual GDP. The comparison between this and the original
flexible rate run is meant to illustrate some aspects of the importance of

Germany as a "locomotive" in pulling the European train toward potential
output paths.

The Standard Simulation
Tables 11 and 12 display some results from the standard flexible—

exchange rate run. The figures in Table 11 show differences between the flexible
rate and fixed exchange rate simulations. In this table the cumulative
current account figures show that impossibly large net foreign asset positions

would result if exchange rates were fixed. Germany, Italy, the U.K., and
the U.S. would accumulate very large net foreign assets without flexible rates
while the LDC's and several smaller OECD countries would have huge net

liabilities. In general, the fastest growing countries (the LDC's and the
smaller OECD countries), are forced to depreciate to reduce their foreign liabilities while the relatively slow—growing major OECD countries appreciate and
decrease their foreign assets compared to a fixed rate regime.
Table 11 shows also the changes in export market penetration caused by

the flexible exchange rate system. Countries which depreciate gain market share
and conversely for the appreciating countries.

Table 12 gives further results for the standard flexible rate
simulation; the real exchange rates, world market shares, balance on petroleum,
and incremental inflation rates. All of the large OECD countries, except France,
and OPEC, CPES, Australia, and Switzerland have an increased real exchange rate
at the end of the simulation while the rest depreciate to varying degrees.
Under a fixed exchange rate regime with high growth, the largest gainers
in

world market shares are the fast growing countries; at the top of the list

come Japan, OPEC and other LDC's. At the other end slow growing "mature" OECD
countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland,

Belgium, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries are losing markets. These
changes are due to two types of effects. They can happen through market growth
depending on whether countries are exporting to the fast or slow growing markets

or through distribution effect: in the modela country with higher growth of
capacity output relative to that of its competitors means that the country in
question is capturing markets.
The balance of payments difficulties arising from different growth rates
of outputs under fixed exchange rate regimes imply potential pressures on countries'

exchange rates or on internal balance in the longer run. The flexible exchange
rate run produces one possibility to look at the pressures on exchange rates
of different countries and also to look at the consequences of this on the

market shares of different countries through changes in relative price competi-

tiveness. The projection shows the orders of magnitudes of these changes (see
real exchange rate column in Table 12). Japan, German, the Netherlands, Switzer—
land, Belgium, and the United Kingdom are appreciating their currencies in
real terms mostly due to a tendency to run current account surpluses under fixed

exchange rates. Surpluses and thus appreciation would occur, however, for
different reasons.

—32—

Fast growing Japan is capturing markets but it also exports a remarkable

share to fast growing markets of LDC's. The latter is also true for Germany
being among major exporters to developing countries. The United Kingdom's
surplus is generated mainly due to slowly growing import demand but also to

fast growing markets for their exports in LDC's. The appreciation is also
reflected in market shares: in general, appreciating countries are losing
markets due to the weakening of their price competitiveness when compared to

the projection under the regime of fixed exchange rates. Scandinavian countries,
Mediterranean countries and non—oil LDC's are devaluing their currencies in
real terms as a consequence of running current account deficits with fixed

exchange rates. This is increasing their shares of world markets from what
they would be under the assumption of fixed exchange rates.
It should be noted here that the good export performance of Japan and

non—oil LDC's in the model is due to different reasons. Japan's success
comes from a better non—price competitiveness measured by relative growth
of capacity output (i.e., expanding productive capacity is assumed to be linked
with rapid introduction of technological innovation, intensified export promotion, etc.), while at the same time Japan is experiencing losses due to the

appreciating yen. In the case of non—oil LDC's, both better price and non—price
competitiveness are helping to increase market share. The channel through increase price—competitiveness due to a large devaluation of LDC's currencies is
much more important as indicated by comparison between fixed and flexible exchange rate runs of Table 11; under fixed rate assumptions non—oil LDC's world
market shares increase from 11.1 percent in 1979 to 12.6 percent in 1990 but
jumps 4.4 percentage points from this to 15.5 percent due to the introduction

of the flexible exchange rate regime. It is obvious that the flexible exchange
rate run overestimates non—oil LDC's share.

-.33—

The final columns in Table 13 show the incremental inflation rates.
Since there is no money growth or excess demand for goods in this model there
are only two causes for an increase in the domestic GDP deflators: exogenous

oil price increases and exchange rate changes. The first of the two columns
shows the average increase in the inflation rate due to the exogenous oil price
increase while the second gives the changes in inflation rates due to changes

of exchange rates. For the appreciating countries there are deflationary pressures while for depreciating countries there are inflationary pressures. The
effects of exchange rate movements on the domestic price level are more pronounced for the smaller and more open economies.

Higher

Growth in Germany

For this simulation it

was

assumed that

Germany's

growth rate of output

was, on average, one percentage point higher than in the standard run. Here
we compare the results of the two simulations to illustrate some of the cross—
country linkages present in the model.
Due to the higher growth Germany's current account is lowered (see Table

13) and its real exchange rate depreciates by 23% by 1990. This depreciation
lowers the relative price of German exports, giving it an additional 1.4% of the

world's non—oil goods market by 1990 and causing a 0.4% increase in the average
domestic inflation rate.

The countries affected most strongly are France, Italy, the United

Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands. For all countries there are two
primary channels of influence; the exchange rate determination system and the

current account. France's, Italy's, and the U.K.'s exchange rates are linked
directly to Germany's current account. Initially Germany's current account
worsens due to higher import demand, while theirs improves because of higher

exports to Germany. This causes France's, Italy's and the U.N.'s exchange rates
to appreciate and Germany's to depreciate. In the longer run the appreciation
of the three currencies outweigh the direct stimulus from Germany's import

demand and the current accounts weaken. All three lose market shares and
experience a decline in their inflation rates.
For the smaller European countries the effects are somewhat different.
With the exception of Ireland, whose exchange rate is closely linked to the
U.K.'s, all experience an improved trade, and, hence, current account balance

because of increased German demand. AU of their exchange rates appreciate
slightly and their inflation rates are lowered. Here it must be remembered
that output is always kept at an exogenous level so there is no labor market
pressure on costs, only pressure from the change In prices of imported goods.

The effects on the non—European countries are relatively small. OPEC
does experience a significant increase in its current account due to increased

oil exports to Germany. The effects on Canada, Japan, the U.S., Australia,
and New Zealand are very small.
