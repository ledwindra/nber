                              IRAs and Saving



                                  ABSTRACT



      Increasing current Individual Retirement Account (IRA) limits would lead
 to substantial increases in tax-deferred saving according to evidence in the
 paper, based on the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances. For example, the recent
Treasury Plan would increase IRA Contributions by about 30 percent. The
primary focus of the paper, however, is the effect of limit increases on other
saving. How much of the IRA increase would be offset by reduction in
non-tax-deferred saving? The weight of the evidence suggests that very little
of the increase would be offset by reduction in other financial assets,
possibly 10 to 20 percent. The estimates suggest that 45 to 55 percent of the
IRA increase would be funded by reduction in expenditure for other goods and
services, and about 35 percent by reduced taxes. The analysis rests on a
savings decision structure recognizing the constraint that the IRA limit
places on the allocation of current income; it is a constrained optimization
model with the IRA limit the principle constraint. The evidence also suggests
substantial variation in saving behavior among segments of the population. In
addition, it appears that IRAs do not serve as a substitute for private
pension plans. Thus the legislative goal of disproportionately increasing
retirement saving among persons without pension plans is apparently not being
realized. But the more general goal of increasing general saving is.

                                         by

                       Steven F. Venti and David A. Wise


          Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) were established in 1974 as

 part of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to
                                                          encourage employees
 not covered by private pension plans to save for retirement. The Economic

 Recovery Tax Act of 1981 extended the availability of IRAs to all employees

 and raised the contribution limit. The
                                           legislation emphasized the need to
enhance the economic well-being of future retirees and the need to increase

national saving. Now any employee with earnings above $2000 can contribute

$2000 to an IRA account each year. An employed person and a non-working

spouse C8fl contribute a total of $2250, while a married couple who are both

working can contribute $2000 each. Current tax proposals contemplate

substantial increases in the limits. The tax on the principal and interest

is deferred until money is   withdrawn from the account. There is a penalty

for withdrawal before age 59i, which is apparently intended to discourage

the use of IRAs for non-retirement
                                     saving.

         To determine whether IRA accounts serve as a substitute for private

pension plans, it is important to know who contributes to IRAs. Whether

they are an important form of saving for retirement depends on how much is

contributed. In addition, the short-run tax cost of IRAs depends on their

prevalence. These questions have been addressed by Venti and Wise [1985a]

for the United States and by Wise (1984, 1985] for Canada. The central

focus of this paper is the relationship between IRA contributions and other
                                   -2-


forms of saving. What is the net effect of IRA accounts on -individual

saving? In addressing this question, estimates of desired IRA contributions

are also obtained, and these estimates can be compared with results based on

other data sources.

         Ideal data to answer this question would provide information on

changes in all forms of assets over time. One could then compare annual IRA

contributions with increases or decreases in other forms of saving.

The set of questions that can be addressed directly with available data is

limited, however. IRAs were only open to most employees beginning in 1982

and currently available data pertain only to that year. In addition, only

limited information -is available on changes in other asset holdings in 1982.

Given the data limitations, the goal of the analysis presented in this paper

is to estimate the effect that changes in the IRA contribution limit would

have on other forms of saving, as well as on IRA contributions themselves.

As explained below, other forms of saving probably are best thought of as

liquid assets.

         There are two central questions that arise -in considering the

effect of newly available IRAs on net saving: the first is the extent to

which IRA contributions are made by withdrawing funds from other existing

balances, and thus explicitly substituting one form of saving for another.

Presumably such substitution would be made by taking funds from existing

liquid asset balances, like other savings accounts. It is unlikely that in

the short run, IRA contributions would be made by reducing non-liquid asset

balances like housing. A related question, although possibly more subtle

and difficult to answer empirically, is whether new saving would have been
                                     —3-


 placed in other accounts were it not for the availability of IRAs,

 independent of existing balances.

          Another question is the extent to which IRA contributions may

 ultimately serve as a substitute for non-liquid assets.   In the long run

 individuals may contribute to IRAs instead of investing in housing, for

example. This question is more difficult to address empirically, and no

attempt is made to answer it here. Whether IRA contributions were

substituted for other liquid assets in 1982 is the question that can be most

directly addressed using the available data. But we believe that the

estimates may also provide a reasonable indication of the trade-off between

IRA contributions and liquid assets in the long run as well. The spirit of

the paper is to distinguish direct evidence about which the results are

likely to be relatively robust from questions about which the evidence is

only indirect. An attempt is made to draw inferences based on the weight of

the evidence. In short, given the available data and their limitations,

what can be said about the effect of IRAs on net individual saving?

         Background data on IRA contributions and other wealth holdings are

presented in section I. The model used for estimation is developed in section

II. Its key feature is constrained optimization, with the limit on IRA

contributions the primary constraint. The principle goal is to obtain

estimates of the effect of changes in IRA limits on other saving, as well as

on IRA contributions themselves. The model addresses the allocation of

current income. This approach has been chosen over a model of presumed

lifetime saving behavior, although the allocation of current income could be

thought of as the reduced form of a life cycle model. In addition, estimates
                                      -4-

of   the allocation of current income based on age and other personal attributes

allow inferences about life cycle saving behavior.

          The results are presented in section III. The emphasis is on the

sensitivity of the results to model specification and to the interpretation

of a key variable, "savings and reserve funds.1' The most important results

are presented in the form of simulations of the effect of proposed limit

changes on IRA contributions and other saving. Some of the results

developed here can be compared with evidence based on other data sources.

Comparable evidence on IRA contributions for 1982 has been developed by

Venti and Wise (1985], based on Current Population Survey data. The results

of this paper are based on the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which

presents information on IRAs in 1982. Section IV presents a summary of the

findings and concluding discussion.



1.     Descriptive Statistics

           About 16 percent of wage earner families have IRA accounts, as

shown in table 1.1 Almost no families with incomes under $10,000 have them

and only about 7 percent of families with incomes between $10,000 and

$20,000. Somewhat more than half of those with incomes greater than $50,000

contribute to IRAs.2 The distribution of all contributors by income interval

is as follows:




1Self-employed persons have been excluded from the analysis.

2Numbers based on CPS data (Venti and Wise (1985]) indicate a higher
proportion of wage earners with IRAs. While the CPS data are weighted to
represent the employed population, the SCF data reported here are weighted
to represent families with a wage earner.

         Older persons are considerably more likely than younger ones to

contribute, although the proportion drops at age 65 when a large proportion of

employees retire. For example, among families in the $20,000 to $30,000

income interval, 36 percent of those 55 to 64 contributed but only 11 percent

of those aged 25 to 34.

         The subsequent analysis will rely in part on responses to a

question that asketh "Considering all of your savings and reserve funds,

overall, did you put more money in or take more money out in 1982V'3 The

precise interpretation that should be assigned the responses is unclear. In

particular, it is not clear whether savings and reserve funds include or

exclude IRA Contributions. The analysis is conducted and the results are

evaluated using both interpretations, although we believe it is most

plausible to assume that IRAs are excluded. We presume that responses do

not reflect non-liquid assets like housing. The proportion of families




3mree responses were possible: (1) Put more money in. (2) Stayed the
same.  (3) Took more money out.

indicating   an -increase in "savings and reserve funds" is shown in table 2.

Only 32 percent of respondents indicated an increase in 1982, while the

remainder indicated a decrease or no change.4 The proportion indicating an

increase rises markedly with income, but shows little relationship to age.

         A key consideration in our analysis is the relationship between IRA

contributions and the change in "savings and reserve funds". Suppose IRA

contributions were typically taken from "savings and reserve funds" balances.

If savings and reserve funds include IRAs, there would be no change in overall

savings and reserve funds. If the latter were interpreted to exclude IRAs,

contributions to IRAs should be associated with a decline in savings and

reserve funds. Apparently neither is true. Persons who contribute to IRAs

are much more likely to indicate an increase than those who don't. The ratio

of the proportion of IRA contributors with an increase in "savings and reserve

funds" to the proportion of noncontributors with an increase is shown in table

3, by income and age. Overall, contributors are more than twice as likely as

noncontributors to indicate an increase, although this number reflects in part

different distributions of contributors and noncontributors by income and age.

The average of the cell ratios -is 1.77.

         Thus these numbers suggest that there are savers and non—savers and

that savers save both through IRAs and through other forms; the positive

relationship reflects an individual-specific effect. The subsequent analysis




4mis evidence -is consistent with the widespread perception that individual
savings rates in the United States have been unusually low in recent years and
that consumer debt has been increasing, See, for example, the New York Times,
October 29, 1985; the Boston Globe, September 15 and November 22, 1985.

provides support for an individual-specific savings effect, while also

suggesting a substantial positive effect of IRAs on net individual saving.

         To put IRA contributions in perspective and to help to interpret

the analysis below, it is useful to have in mind the magnitude of individual

wealth holdings. The median wealth of persons in the sample is $22,900,

excluding pensions and Social Security wealth.5 Even among persons 55 to

64, the median is only $55,000 (see table 4). Most of this wealth is non-

liquid, the preponderance of which is housing. Consistent with other evi-

dence (e.g., 1-lurd and Shoven (1985], Bernheim [1984], Diamond and Hausman

[1984]), a large proportion of individuals have very little non-housing

wealth; they save very little. Median liquid assets, excluding stocks and

bonds, are shown in table 5, by income and age. The median for all families

is $1,200. For families earning $30,000 to $40,000 with a head 45 to 54

years it is only $4,600. While most people have some liquid assets, only

about 20 percent have financial assets in the form of stocks or bonds.6 Thus

it is clear that most people have not been accumulating financial assets at

a rate close to the $2000 per year that an IRA allows.




5me following breakdown of wealth is used throughout this paper:
         Liquid Assets: checking accounts, certificates of deposit,
            savings accounts, money market accounts, savings bonds
         Other Financial Assets: stocks, bonds, trusts
         IRAs and Keoghs: balances
         Other Assets: value of home, other property and receivables
         Debt: mortgage and consumer debt
    Total wealth is the sum of the first four categories minus debt. Wealth
does not include the cash value of life insurance, the value of motor
vehicles, and pension and social security wealth.

6The median for all financial assets including stocks and bonds is 1.3, versus
1.2 when they are excluded. For more detail, see Venti and Wise (1985b].

         The median wealth of IRA contributors divided by the median wealth

of noncoritributors, by income and age, is shown in table 6. Contributors

have substantially higher wealth on average. The average of the cell

ratios is 1.5O. The analysis below, however, indicates that after

controlling for other variables, total wealth is in fact negatively related to

IRA contributions. The results, including detail by liquid versus non-liquid

wealth, suggest that the numbers in table 6 also reflect individual-specific

saving effects; some people are savers, others are not.

         In summary: the descriptive data confirm that low income persons

are unlikely to contribute to IRAs. But they provide no direct evidence that

IRA contributions are offset by reductions in other forms of saving; persons

who contribute to IRAs are more likely than those who do not to indicate an

overall increase in savings and reserve funds. The descriptive data, however,

do not reveal whether savers save more because of the IRA option. The

subsequent analysis is intended to shed light on this issue.



II. Allocation of Income: Individual Saving and IRA Constraints

         Given the limitations of the data, the goal is to develop a

statistical model that will allow inferences based on the information that

is available. The approach is to consider the allocation of current income

in the spirit of expenditure studies, but with concentration on what is not

spent for current consumption. The key feature of the approach is to

incorporate the limit on tax-deferred saving in the estimation procedure




7weighted by the number of IRA contributors.
                                      —15—


 and then to infer from the parameter estimates how savings behavior would

 change if the limit were changed. To assure that estimated constrained and

 unconstrained behavior are internally consistent, the functional forms of the

 estimated equations are related through an underlying decision function.       The

 model is intended to be "structural" with respect to changes -in the IRA limit,

 although as explained below, not necessarily with respect to the individual

 variables that are used to estimate choice parameters of individuals.     We

 begin with a simple example and then present the specifications used for

estimation. For expository purposes, we also discuss first a specification

 that implies only a limited form of substitution between IRA and other saving.

We then present a model that allows more flexible substitution and that

incorporates the first as a special case.



      A. A Simple Example

          Suppose that current income Y can be allocated to tax-deferred IRA

                                                                      -
saving S, to other forms of saving S2. or to current uses, Y -
                                                                 S1       S.
Assume also that were there no limit on S1, or if persons were not constrained

by the limit, observed levels of S and 2 would be fit by the functions

                       and
          S1 =   bY,
(1)
          S2 = b2Y.


For estimation, we need also to consider saving functions that are consistent

with these, but for persons who are constrained by the limit on S1. These may

be obtained by considering an underlying decision function that is consistent

with observed saving decisions.

          The saving allocations in (1) are in accordance with the decision
                                                 -16-

           V —
             — (Y —         -         i-b1-b2    b1     b2
(2)                    S        S2)             s1 2
where b1 and b2 are parameters. Maximization of (2) with respect to S and

2 yields (1). The presumption is that the b's depend on measured personal

attributes like age, income, wealth, education, marital status; unmeasured

attributes that affect saving behavior in general; and unmeasured attributes

like expected future liquidity needs or attitude toward risk that may affect

the preferred allocation of income to S1, versus S2. This specification

treats IRAs and other forms of saving as different "goods," thus emphasizing

non—price differences between the two forms of saving. In particular, because

of the early withdrawal penalty that makes IRA5 less liquid than other saving,

they may tend to be more narrowly targeted to retirement consumption; much of

saving in other forms may be for different and more short term purposes. The

"price" difference between the two forms of saving is brought out below.

Following the decision function (2), if S1 cannot exceed the limit L, the

saving functions are

                                         if b1Y < L
                      b1Y

           Si =
                  I... L                 if b1V ? L

(3)
                                         if b1Y < L
                      b2Y
           S,) = J
                  lb
                  1             (V—L)    if b1Y ? L
                           1


The relationship between income and S2 saving depends on whether the limit

on the tax-deferred S1 saving has been reached. In the subsequent discussion,
                                                      -17—


 we shall begin with a decision function, but it should be understood that
                                                                           it

 is chosen to be consistent with observed saving decisions. It is a construct

 that assures that constrained and unconstrained savings functions are

 consistent with each other.

             It will be important to estimate the change in S2 with a change in

 the limit L. In this case dS2/dL =
                                                  -b2/(1-b1),   depending only on the b's.

Thus to obtain good estimates of the effect of limit changes, it is necessary

only to have good estimates of these parameters; not necessarily of the effect

on the b's of the variables that will be used to estimate them. Figure 1

describes graphically the relationship between income and S1 and 2' with

particular reference to the estimated specification described in section B

below.


       B. The Estimated Model: A Special Case

             In practice, S2 could be negative. "Desired" S1 could also be

negative, although not its observed value. Previous work by Venti and Wise

[1985a) and by Wise [1985] indicates that IRA contributions alone can be

described well by a Tobit specification with limits at zero and L.8 In

addition, the cost of one dollar of S1 in terms of current consumption is

(1 -   t),   where t is the marginal tax rate, whereas the cost of S2 is 1.

             A decision function and implicit budget constraint that incorporates

these characteristics is


                                                                         b

8For most purposes it is not necessary to specify two behavioral equations:
one describing contributor status and the other the amount.

 The presumption is that if both S1 and S2 were zero, current consumption

 would be V -            1,   where I is total taxes. This amount serves as the base

 case. If IRA contributions S1 are made, taxes are reduced                                                         9

 practice, t1current consumption" includes some forms of saving like housing

the small potential IRA contributions relative to income.

reached.

           For expositional purposes, an advantage of the specification

described above is that a closed form solution to the constrained saving

function can be obtained from the decision function. This is not always the

case. Indeed, as shown below, it is not true with the more general

specification described in section C below.11 General discussions of demand

with "rationing are presented in Deaton and Muellbauer 11981] and in Deaton

[1981], with the discussion often in terms of indirect utility or expenditure

functions. Oeaton shows that closed form solutions to constrained demand

functions can be obtained in some cases even when the utility function is not

separable, the property that assures a closed form solution in the

specification above.

           The parameters b1 and b2 are specified as functions of individual

attributes by


           b1 =   4[XB1]
(7)
           b2 =   [XB2]

where X is a vector of individual characteristics and the B's are vectors of

parameters to be estimated. The unit normal distribution function



forms for the constrained and unconstrained S2 functions, there is some
precedent for including asset (saving) balances in a true utility function.
See for example Sidrauski [1967), Fischer [1979], Calvo [1979], Obstfeld
[1984, 1985], and Poterba and Rotemberg [1986]. With a1 and a2 random, as
described below, annual S1 and S2 flows could be thought of as proxies for
balances.

11A similar situation characterizes the specification used by Hausman and Ruud
[1984], for example, to describe family labor supply. Their specification
yields unconstrained closed form solutions to the labor supply functions of
the husband and the wife, consistent with an indirect utility function. But
constrained functions analogous to ours are only defined implicitly.

a1 means lower desirpd S2 and large a2 lower desired S1.13
            In additio , an alternative stochastic specification assumes that

a1 and a2 are non-stochastic, but simple additive disturbance terms are added

to the unconstrained S1 and S2 equations. Details of the stochastic structure

under both specifications are presented in Venti and Wise (1985b]. An

important parameter is the correlation between the disturbance terms in S1 and

       This correlation contributes to inference about the extent to which

observed saving behavior results from unmeasured individual—specific effects

or the extent to which saving in one form is offset by saving in another.

The latter interpretation is we believe the most likely to reflect the

respondent's intent. Most of the discussion and reported simulations are

based on this assumption. Nonetheless, we shall present some estimates based

on the S =             +2    interpretation. This interpretation should provide the

most stable estimates.14 We show that estimates based on this interpretation

are rather insensitive to important assumptions. Estimates are obtained by

maximum likelihood.

                Implicit in the functional form described above is an "independence"

assumption that restricts the implied substitution between                            and S2 on the

one hand and current consumption on the other. Consider the allocation of a

marginal dollar of current income before and after the limit on S1 has been

reached. The marginal shares allocated to S, 2' and consumption are:

Thus the ratio of the marginal share that goes to S2 versus the share that

goes to consumption, b2/(1 - b1                    -          is independent of whether the limit

on S has been reached. One might expect, however, that this ratio would

increase after the limit is reached if there is greater substitution between

S1 and S2 than between either of these and consumption.

           The importance of this property is what it implies about the effect

of an increase in the tax-deferred limit L on non-tax—deferred saving
                                                                                                             2•
Only persons at the limit will be affected by increasing it. For these

people, dS1/dL = 1.            The amount that is taken from non-tax-deferred saving

is in principle provided by three features of the model: (1) the functional
form itself; (2) the limit L on S1; and (3) by direct information on the value
of S2 in addition to its sign, if "savings and reserve funds" is interpreted
to include IRAs. For more detail, see Venti and Wise [1985b].
15A dollar of current after-tax income allocated to S1 yields S1/(1 —                                       t)   in tax-
deferred saving.

16This effect can be seen from figure 1. The effect of changing the limit is to
shift downward the function     described by the steeper sloped segment of
the S2 function and the dashed extension of it.

 The function (10) is the same as the preference function (4) above and

yields the same constrained savings functions as those in equations (5) and

 (6), but with b1 =                a     and b2 = (1 —          a).
               Because the parameters a and $ have informative interpretations, we

shall estimate them as functions of X, as an alternative to estimation of

b1 and b2. Although if b1, b2, a, and                                    were the same for all persons in

the sample --          not     functions of attributes X --                     the   equalities would hold,

they will not necessarily hold when each is estimated as a function of X.

For example, the mean over X of b1 =                                       will not equal the mean over X
                                                                [XB1]

where A and B are vectors of parameters to be estimated.

              With this parameterization, it is convenient to think of                                         as the

marginal after-tax dollar devoted to saving (S1 and                                           and a as the

 believe that the results are not very sensitive to which of these stochastic

 specifications is used.2°



 hr. Results

        A. Data

            The estimates are based on the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances.

 The Survey provides detailed information on asset balances of all kinds, as

 well as on income and other personal attributes.      From data on IRA balances
 it is possible to infer 1982 contributions, as explained in appendix A.

 Unfortunately the data do not include changes in other asset balances in

 1982, as emphasized above. The absence of this data has led us to con-

centrate on information contained in the change in "savings and reserve

funds" question.

           Estimation is based on 1068 observations. Families were deleted

from the original sample if they were ineligible for an IRA (self—employed

or not working). Nonresponse reduced the sample further.       The data most

often missing were self—reported marginal tax rates and the series of

responses required to calculate housing equity. The variable means in the

estimation sample (Appendix Table 1) are very close to the means for all of




20Similar evidence for the k = 0 case is presented in Venti and Wise [1985bj,

those surveyed, however.21 Estimates based on a larger sample using predicted

marginal tax rates are not appreciably different from those reported below

based on self-reported rates.



     B. Parameter Estimates

         As emphasized above, the main concern is to obtain "reliable"

estimates of b1 and b2 (or of a and ); they are the principle determinants of

the effect of a change in L on IRA and non-IRA saving. While the effect of

the variables X on the b's is of interest, it is not necessary to obtain

unbiased estimates of these effects to estimate the effect of changing L. The

model is intended to be structural with respect to L, not necessarily with

respect to the effects of the variables X that determine the b's.22 Given the

limit L, the parameters a1 and a2, and the parameters b1 and b2, S1 and

S2 savings are given by the functions like those graphed in figure 1. Their

amounts may be calculated given after-tax income, Y-T. If the limit is

increased by AL, the constrained S2 function is shifted downward by

                    AL, using equation (6), and its intersection (the kink

point in figure 1) with the unconstrained function is shifted outward. Given

the new limit, new S1 and S2 values may be calculated. The effect of changing

the limit depends only on b1 and b2. Thus in reporting the results we




21For example, mean wealth in the estimation sample is $59,781 and it is $59,090
in the total sample, mean age is 37.7 versus 39.4, mean education is 13.4
versus 12.2, and the mean self—reported marginal tax rate is 0.25 versus 0.27.

22Using the regression analogy, it is equivalent to obtaining an unbiased
estimate of E(Y J X), where V = Xb+c, rather than unbiased estimates of each
component of b.

emphasize the sensitivity of the estimated values of b1 and b2 to model

specification. To simulate the average effect of a limit change, random

values of a1 and a2 are selected from a bivariate normal distribution using

the estimated means and covariance terms. (The alternative specification

assumes additive disturbances on the S1 and S2 equations, also with a

bivariate normal distribution.)23

           We begin with estimates based on the limited substitution model

with b1 and b2 parameterized (equations 5 and 6). Based on this specification

we shall first consider a base case with S =
                                                        S.   We then discuss variants of

this specification, some under the assumption that S =
                                                                  S1
                                                                       +
                                                                           2•    The estimates

with S =        +
           S1       S2 should in principle be the most stable. We show in

particular that the estimated values of 01 and 02 are very close and that the

hypothesis that a =           2     cannot be rejected. This is a potentially important

restriction that has been imposed under the assumption that S =
                                                                                S2.
           These latter estimates may be compared with those obtained with k=O

but with a and ,         instead of b1 and b2, parameterized. To provide a summary
measure that allows comparison across the specifications, we present

estimated values of S1 and S2 saving out of the marginal dollar of after-tax

income, defined by

               b1
                               a
                         =                 and
            (1 -    t)       (1 —   t)
           b2 = (1 -         a)
where the equalities hold only if b1 and b2, a and             are not parameterized.

           Finally, estimates with k set at .65 are presented. In practice,



23A potentially important assumption is the presumed distribution of the random
terms. The results below show that the model fits the observed data well by
income interval and this provides some support for the distributional
                                     -30-


widely varying values of k cannot be distinguished by the data.24 Within—

sample predictions are essentially the same.   Nonetheless the predicted

effects of limit changes do depend on the assumed substitution behavior

under which the data were generated. Thus we set k at a rather high level

and obtain estimates for the other parameters. Indications of model fit,

simulation results, and the sensitivity of the simulations to model

specification follow.

         1. Limited Substitution, b1 and b2 Parameterized

             a. The Base Specification

         Parameter estimates obtained under the assumption that S = S2 are

shown in Table 7. The correlation between the random preference parameters

a1 and a2 is .47 (with a standard of error of .06). The implied correlation

between the S and S2 disturbance terms is .16, evaluated at the mean of the

data. Although the correlation is small, it is consistent with an individual-

specific savings effect (presumably due to unmeasured individual attributes)

that affects both IRA and other saving in the same direction. It does not

provide support for the possibility that persons who save more in one form




assumptions. A better test would be to use the model to predict the effect of
a limit change. While this is not possible for the United States, such
predictions have been made for Canadian tax-deferred saving contributions
using a specification similar to the one used here for IRA contributions. The
model estimated using data from one year predicted very accurately the
contributions in a later year with a 60 percent lower contribution limit, and
vice—versa. See Wise [1984, 1985]. The results are also summarized in Venti
and Wise {1985a].

24Similar findings are reported by Mundlak [1975] and by Gr-iliches and Ringstad
[1971] with respect to production data. In our case, the likelihood function
is very flat around k = 0.

tend to save less -in the other. This substitution hypothesis would be

consistent with a negative correlation.

         The estimated coefficients on the wealth variables also seem con—

sistent with an individual-specific savings effect. Liquid assets, which are

likely to be the most readily transferred to IRA accounts are positively

related to IRAs, but they are also positively related to other saving. Indeed

the relationship to the S2 saving is much greater than the relationship to

IRAs. A $1,000 increase in liquid assets is associated with a $45 increase

in S2. but only a $5 increase in S1. Parameterization -in terms of a and

shows a positive relationship of liquid assets to total saving in the two

forms but a negative relationship to the proportion of the total devoted to

IRAs, as shown in table 8 below. Non-liquid assets are negatively related to

both S1 and 2 saving. Parameterization of a and     shows that non—liquid

wealth is negatively related to total saving -in these forms, but is positively

related to the proportion devoted to IRAs. (As shown -in appendix table 4,

total wealth is negatively related to total saving in the S1 and S2 forms, and

is unrelated to the allocation to S1 versus S2.) Thus this evidence also

seems to support individual-specific saving preferences; some persons are

savers and others not, some save -in liquid and others in less liquid forms.

But the evidence does not provide much support for the possibility that IRA

funds were typically withdrawn from other liquid asset balances.25

         It is important to keep in mind that in this specification, cumulated

assets serve as a measure of individual—specific savings effects. They are



25t is not possible to reach strong conclusions based on this evidence because
the asset balances are reported after an IRA contribution and because it is
not clear what the relationship should be if liquid assets, say, are larger
than the IRA limit. But if liquid assets were relatively large at the end of
the period one might suppose that they were large when the IRA decision was
                                                  —33-


 not intended to serve as exogenous determinants of the b's; in this sense they

 would be endogenous. But their relationship to the b's also provides us with

 information about the hypothesis that IRA contributions are simply taken from

 other saving balances.

            The mean estimated b1 and b2 parameters, .174 and .102 respectively,

 also suggest a strong preference for IRA versus other saving. At the margin,

 17 cents of an additional dollar of after—tax income would go to IRAs ——

 yielding   about 25 cents in IRA saving -- and about 10 cents would go to

S2 saving.

            It is tempting to explain the difference between b1 and b2 by the

difference in the return to tax—deferred versus non-tax-deferred saving. The

revealed preference for IRAs -is distinct from the lower price of tax-deferred

saving in terms of current consumption, which through the current year budget

constraint of our model serves to increase the amount of IRA saving, given

b1 and b2. For example, suppose that r is the interest rate, t' is the

marginal tax rate during the time that funds are in an IRA account, t is the

rate when funds are withdrawn, and the contribution -is made at age j' and

withdrawn at age j. A dollar invested in an IRA yields
1'(l -   t)ej   -
                    '•[i   -
                               p(j)J,    where p(j) is a penalty for early withdrawal.

The penalty is 0 if j >     59i      and .1 if j <       59.       A dollar of non-tax-deferred

saving yields (1 -   t')e'11

                                      t')(J       i'. Thus the ratio of the tax— to non—

and j >   59), it is simply ert(j ').                   Thus because of the tax free

compounding of interest in IRA accounts, as well as the possible difference

between pre- and post-retirement tax rates, persons in higher marginal tax

brackets should have a greater incentive to save through IRAs.26

           The penalty for early withdrawal makes the IRA less liquid and thus

may detract from the desirability of IRAs, however.27 But the liquidity

consideration should be less important for people with higher marginal tax

rates. Taking account of the penalty for early withdrawal, the tabulation

below shows the number of years that funds must be left in an IRA account for

the return to exceed the non-tax-deferred return.




26j  is also informative to consider the cost, in terms of current consumption,
of providing retirement income. Suppose, thinking in a manner roughly
consistent with statements of some pension planners, an individual wants to
accumulate a given retirement fund by age j > 59i. If the amount accumulated
through    saving is to be equivalent to that accumulated through S2 saving,

S2 relative to S1 would be S2/S1 = [(1 -       -

in terms of current consumption is given by (S21S1) = [C2/C1(1 -                 t')l,    where C
represents current consumption cost. Thus
C2/C1 =   [1   -   t)/(1   -   tt)2jert
                                             -

                                        is of course another way of
emphasizing the IRA advantage. But it also suggests that the income effect
created by the lower IRA cost could in theory lead to greater consumption,
although the parameter estimates themselves, together with the simulations
presented below, are inconsistent with this conceptual possibility.

27We say may because one of us finds the non-liquid aspect of the IRA a positive
attribute. So much for "rationalt' behavior.

Thus it is clear that both the interest rate arid the marginal tax rate should

have a substantial effect on the desirability of IRAs to the extent that

short-term liquidity is an important consideration.

         We are, however, unable to demonstrate convincingly an increasing

preference for IRAs with increasing marginal tax rates. The coefficient on

the marginal tax rate is significant in both b1 and b2 when it is entered as a

determinant of the b's. Indeed -its estimated effect -is somewhat larger in
                                                                              b2.

(See appendix table 6.) Results with a and 3 parameterized show that the

marginal tax rate -is positively related to total saving, 13, but is negatively

related to the proportion allocated to IRAs, a. These results seem to suggest

that the marginal tax rate is picking up an individual-specific saving effect,

but seems not related to a particular preference for IRAs. Wise (1984] was

unable to identify an effect of the marginal tax rate on tax-deferred saving

in Canada, using precisely measured marginal tax rates, as opposed to the

self-reported rates used here.28 While the marginal tax rate enters our budget



28Wise [1984] contains analysis of Canadian tax-deferred Registered Retirement
Saving Plans. In general, we have found that the estimated effect of the
marginal tax rate is very sensitive to functional form. See also Wise [1985]
and Venti and Wise [1985a]. King and Leape (1984] also mention the difficulty
of isolating the effect of the marginal tax rate and they conclude:
                                      -36--


constraint   as the cost of S1, the functional form virtually assures a positive

relationship between the tax rate and IRA saving. We do not estimate a price

parameter directly. Rather the price enters as a transformation to the data.

Indeed the likelihood function is somewhat higher if P1 is set to one for

everyone, although the effect on the simulations reported below is not

substantial.

         Thus, while difficult to demonstrate, we believe that the widespread

promotion of IRA accounts may be the most important reason for increased

saving through their use.

         In addition, the estimates do not suggest more IRA saving among persons

without than with private pension plans, one of the primary goals of IRA

legislation. The coefficient on the pension variable (—.0140) is not

significantly different from zero. Furthermore, persons with private pensions

save more in the S2 form. Results based on the parameterization of a and

suggest that while persons without private plans save less, they devote a

larger proportion of what they do save to IRAs.

         The apparent variation in saving behavior among occupations or other

segments of the population has been mentioned by others.29 The strong rela-

tionship of education to IRA saving -is consistent with such variation. In its

relation to b1, a year of education is equivalent to more than two years in

age and more than $30,000 in liquid wealth. The amount of the marginal dollar

devoted to IRAs increases with age but decreases with income.




     contrary to much of the recent literature, that taxes do not play a
decisive role in explaining the difference in portfolio composition across
households.

              b. Variants of the Base Specification

          A potentially important restriction in the base specification is that

 the error variances of a1 and a2 are equal. While this restriction is not

 necessary in principle, under the assumption that S =
                                                                 2 only the functional
 form and the limit L allow identification of the variance of a2. Under the

 assumption that S =        +
                       S1       S2. direct evidence on the residual variance of S2 is
 provided. Estimates based on the assumption that "savings and reserve funds"

S include IRAs and allowing separate estimates of a1 and a2 are presented in

appendix table 2. Both variances are estimated rather precisely and are close
in magnitude (a1 =   8.84,      a2 =   5.45).    Comparison with estimates in appendix

table 3 that restrict a1 to equal a2 shows that the two are not significantly

different by a likelihood ratio test. The other findings discussed above are

not qualitatively affected if it is assumed that S =                +
                                                               S1       S2. except that the
residual correlation is now not significantly different from zero.3°

         Estimates like those in appendix table 2, but using total wealth

only, instead of liquid versus non—liquid wealth, show that total wealth is

in fact negatively related to total S1 and 2 saving and is unrelated to the

proportion allocated to S, as mentioned above. (See appendix table 4.)

Estimates comparable to appendix table 2, but with P1 = 1 for all persons

(ignoring the marginal tax effect) are presented in appendix table 5. The

likelihood value indeed increases, but as shown below, conclusions about the

effect of IRA limit changes are not appreciably altered. Estimates with




301t can be shown that if S =
                              S2 but it is assumed that S = S1 + S2. the
estimated variance of S2 will be biased downward. In addition, the estimated
residual correlation between S1 and S2 will be biased downward.
                                            -38-


additive disturbances, instead of random a1 and a2, are shown in appendix

table 7. The estimates are very close to those in text table 7 discussed

above.

         2. More Flexible Substitution, a and f3 Parameterized

              a. Withk=0
         Estimates with k = 0 are shown in table 8. They are comparable to

those -in table 7, except that a and          instead of b1 and b2, are parameterized,

and additive disturbances instead of random a1 and a2, are used. (Appendix

table 7 shows results with b1 and b2 parameterized and using additive

disturbances.) Only estimates assuming S = S2 are presented with the more

flexible model.31 The basic conclusions are the same as those based on table

7. The mean     is .244 versus .247 in table 7; the mean ô2, .049, is

somewhat smaller than its table 7 counterpart, .102, however.

         This parameterization, however, indicates total S1 + S2 saving out of

marginal income by f3, and the share of the total to S1 by a. Some of the

conclusions have been discussed above. In addition, the estimates indicate

that while total saving increases with age, the proportion allocated to IRAs

does not. The more educated save more but allocate a smaller proportion to

IRAs, according to these results. Thus it is apparently their greater

propensity to save rather than a greater preference for tax—deferred saving

that leads to more IRA saving among the educated. As mentioned above, while

persons without private pension plans save less, these results indicate that

they devote a larger proportion of saving to IRAs. Thus it is apparently

 their lower propensity to save, rather than the same IRA preference as that of

 private pension holders, that leads to comparable desired IRA contributions

 among those with and without private pensions.

               b. With k = .65

         Estimates with k set at .65 are shown in table 9. The individual

parameter estimates are very close to those with k = 0, with the exception of

the constant terms in a and .    Again, differences are summarized in the
61 and 62 measures. The mean        is .213 when k = .65 and .244 with k =    0.
The mean 62 estimates are .028 and .049 respectively.

         The effect of a change in the IRA limit depends in large part on the

difference between the share of marginal income allocated to S2 by people who

are not constrained by the limit and the share allocated to 2 by those who

are constrained by the limit. These shares are denoted by ö2 and

respectively. Their means for k = 0     and k = .65 are as follows:


                                          6*
                                              2

         k = 0          .091             .117

         k =   .65      .046             .096




Thus the predicted relative shift to S2 when the constraint is reached is

greater when the data are assumed to have been generated by individual saving

behavior with greater substitution between
                                                  S1 and S2. This is reflected in

greater reduction in S2 for the k     .65 model when the IRA limit is raised

than for the k = 0 model, as indicated in the simulations below.

     C.   The Model Fit

          Although there is some variation in the model fit by specification.

the differences are quite small. Thus we present comparison of predicted

versus actual values for three illustrative cases. Based on the k = 0 model,

with a and 13 parameterized, table 10 shows simulated versus actual values of

the proportion of respondents with S1 > 0, S1 > L, and S > 0, by income

interval. Possibly most important are the proportions with S > 0 conditional

on S1 = L (at the IRA limit) and with S > 0 conditional on S1 < 0 (no IRA).

Overall the fit is very close. In particular, the model seems not to

underestimate the S2 saving of persons who are at the IRA limit, as might be

expected if not enough substitution of S2 for S were allowed by the model

when the S1 limit is reached. But this simulation shows some over-prediction

of 2 saving for persons below the IRA limit. The simulated predictions are

based on only 10 draws per person, however, so they reflect some random

variation.32 While unconditional overall proportions will match the actual

values closely, nothing in the specifications assures a close fit by income

interval. The model over-predicts saving of low-income persons. This is a

characteristic of all of the specifications.

          This over-prediction is eliminated if the disturbance terms are

allowed to be heteroskedastic, with the variance increasing with income, by

                      +            =         +           The fit based on this model with
specifying      n1Y       e1 and       n2Y       e2.33




321n eight different simulations with 10 draws per person in each the average of
the predicted proportion of those with S > 0 given S1 = L was .676.

335-imilar results were obtained by Wise [1984, 1985] using Canadian data and by
Venti and Wise [1985a] using Current Population Survey data.

k   = 0    is shown in table 11, where it can be seen that the predicted and actual

proportions are very close for all income groups. Finally, illustrative

predictions with k = .65 are shown in table 12. The predicted versus actual

values are very similar to those in the k = 0 case, although if anything the

predicted proportion of those at the limit with S > 0 is somewhat lower than

in the k = 0 case.34 Predictions with b1 and b2 parameter-ized are shown in

appendix table 8, based on the estimates in table 7. This specification

tends to predict a lower portion of those at the limit with S > 0 than the

model with a and /3 parameterized.



          D. Simulations of the Effect of IRA Limit Changes

               To estimate the effect of IRAs on saving, we have predicted the

effect of limit changes on IRA contributions and on other saving. To add

content to this exercise, we have simulated the effects of several recently

proposed limit changes. The first we call the Treasury Plan.35 It would

increase the limit for an employed person from $2000 to $2500, and would

increase the limit for a nonworking spouse from $250 to $2500. Thus, for

example, the contribution limit for a husband and nonworking wife would

increase from $2250 to $5000. A Modified Treasury Plan increases the limit

for an employed person from $2000 to $2500, but only increases the limit for

a nonworking spouse to $500, from $250. Finally, the President's Plan would




341he average over eight simulations with 10 draws per person -in each was .656,
versus .676 in the k = 0 case. The average over three simulations with 50
draws per person in each was .652.

35See U.S. Department of Treasury [1984].
                                     -47-


 leave the limit for an employed person at $2000, but would raise the limit

 for a nonworking spouse from $250 to $2OO0. For comparison, simulated

 savings under the current limit are also shown.

           The predicted changes should be interpreted as indications of

 changes in saving had the IRA limit been higher in 1982.   It is important to

keep in mind that S2 saving undoubtedly excludes changes in non-liquid wealth

such as housing. The possible substitution between IRAs and housing wealth

 in the long run, for example, would not be reflected in these estimates.

They are intended, however, to indicate the extent to which IRA

contributions in 1982 were simply a substitute for other forms of saving,

other than non-liquid assets. The top portion of the table pertains to

individuals who are predicted to be at the IRA limit, since it is only this

group that would be affected by an increase in the limit. The bottom

portion shows simulated contributions by family type. The simulations are

based on the estimation sample. Those in table 13 are based on the estimates

in table 7 and those in table 14 on the k = .65 estimates shown in table 9.

The simulated values are based on 10 random draws for each observation in the

estimation sample.

         The predicted changes in S1 and S2 under the treasury plan for fami-

lies at the IRA limit, for example, are as follows:

         k =    .65          +1091        —210



These values suggest that only ten to twenty percent of the IRA increase is

offset by a reduction in other financial assets. Thus at least in the short

run, tax—deferred IRA accounts have by these estimates led to a relatively

large increase in total individual saving (as defined in this paper).

         Possibly the best indicator of saving is change in consumption. The

average change in "consumption" (as defined implicitly in this paper) under

each plan is shown -in table 16 together with changes in S2 and in taxes. For

example, the simulated changes under the Treasury Plan for families at the

limit are:

                                   Base Model             k = .65 Model

                         -   643          -56.5      -   493       -45.2

       Taxes             -   401          —35.2      -   388       -35.6



Thus possibly fifty percent of the IRA increase is funded by a reduction in

consumption, according to these measures, and possibly thirty-five percent by

reduced taxes, with a relatively small proportion coming from reduction in

other saving.

            The estimated IRA increases can be compared with estimates by Venti

and Wise (1985a] based on 1983 Current Population Survey (CPS) data. The CPS

data reported actual 1982 IRA contributions by interval, while 1982

contributions had to be inferred from balances reported in the SCF. In

addition, self-reported marginal tax rates were used here, while estimated

rates were used in conjunction with the CPS data. Nonetheless the simulated

effects of limit increases are virtually the same. For example, for all

families the simulated increase under the Treasury Plan is twenty-seven

percent versus thirty percent based on the CPS data. The increase for

unmarried heads is nineteen percent versus nineteen percent based on the CPS;

-it is eighty percent versus seventy—nine percent for married one-earner

families; and sixteen percent versus sixteen percent for married two-earner

families.

     E. Sensitivity of Results to Model Specification

            The sensitivity of the results to selected specification changes is

shown in table 16. Possibly the best summary indicator of the effect of

these changes is the simulated change in S2 under the Treasury Plan. In

each case, the decline in 2 is small relative to the increase in IRAs,

although the magnitude of the decline in S2 varies by a factor of four.          None

of the specification changes has much effect on the simulated IRA change.

Assuming that S =       +        tends to reduce the estimated reduction in S,
                    S       S2
except where P1 is set to 1.         In the latter case, the constrained estimate


   of ö2is larger because b2/(l. -          is   larger.



IV. Conclusions

            Increasing the IRA limits would lead to substantial increases in tax-

deferred saving according to our evidence, based on the 1983 Survey of Con—

sumer Finances. For example, the recent Treasury Plan would increase IRA

contributions by about thirty percent. Virtually the same estimate was

obtained in previous analysis based on Current Population Survey data,

suggesting that this conclusion may be relatively robust. The primary focus

of this paper, however, has been the effect of limit increases on other

saving. how much of the IRA increase would be offset by reduction in non-tax-

deferred saving? The weight of our evidence suggests that very little of the

increase would be offset by reduction -in other financial assets, possibly ten

to twenty percent, maybe less. Our estimates suggest that forty-

five to fifty-five percent of the IRA increase would be funded by reduction in

consumption, and about thirty-five percent by reduced taxes.

         The analysis rests on a preference structure recognizing the

constraint that the IRA limit places on the allocation of current income. The

model fits the data well and in particular distinguishes accurately the

savings decisions of persons at the IRA limit versus those who are not.

         The greatest potential uncertainty about the results and the greatest

statistical complication for analysis stems from the limited information on

non-IRA saving and thus the difficulty of obtaining direct estimates of the

degree of substitution between tax-deferred and non-tax-deferred saving. We

have addressed these issues by considering the sensitivity of our conclusions

to specification changes, including assumptions about the interpretation of

key variables and the extent of substitution underlying observed saving

outcomes. Although the magnitude of the estimated reduction in other saving,

with increases in the IRA limit, is sensitive to specification changes, the
                                    —55—


reduction as a percent of the IRA increase is invariably small.

         In addition to these primary conclusions, our evidence suggests

substantial variation in saving behavior among segments of the population. We

also find that IRAs do not serve as a substitute for private pension plans,

although persons without private plans devote a larger proportion of their lower

total saving to IRAs. Thus the legislative goal of disproportionately increasing

retirement saving among persons without pension plans is apparently not being

realized. But the more general goal of increasing individual saving is.

                Appendix A: Imputing 1982 IRA Contributions


         The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) asked respondents if they had

any IRA accounts and the total dollar value in all of them. The SCF did not

ask respondents for their 1982 contribution. Given that ERTA liberalized

eligibility beginning in 1982 (nearly 3/4 of all 1982 accounts were opened in

1982),, the following criteria are used to impute 1982 contributions:

         (a) If the total value of IRAs is less than the 1982 family limit

         then the total value is assumed to be the 1982 contribution.

         (b) If the total value of IRAs exceeds the 1982 family limit then

         the family limit is assumed to be the 1982 contribution.

Imputed IRA contributions based on this procedure compare favorably to

evidence from the CPS, which presents 1982 contributions by interval.
