    "abstract": "\n\nCan the enhanced mobility created by transportation infrastructure investments help people to avoid environmental extremes? We use transaction records from China\u2019s card payment system to measure experienced pollution exposure (EPE)\u2014that is, exposure based on the pollution levels at travelers\u2019 actual locations\u2014and evaluate how EPE was affected by the country\u2019s high-speed railway network, even while holding pollution itself constant. Our estimates imply a reduction in EPE that corresponds to a mortality benefit of 21.3 million life-years saved, primarily due to travelers changing their destinations towards locations with predictably cleaner air.\n\n",
