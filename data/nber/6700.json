This industrial structure inertia is difficult to rationalize in standard trade models.  This paper develops a two-sector industry dynamics model in which industrial composition inertia arises naturally.  The model is then used to study the consequences of different types of trade reforms (e.g. permanent, temporary, gradual, pre-announced) on investment, employment composition, and income distribution.\n\n",
