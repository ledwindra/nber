    "abstract": "\n\nDifferences in labor compensation across 31 large public library systems are examined based on the author's interview survey. Salaries for recruit clerical workers, recruit librarians, and librarians with five years' experience are compared along with hours of work per week and fringe benefits. Cost of living differences in metropolitan areas and collective bargaining are found to be strongly associated with differences in labor compensation. The collective bargaining differential for experienced librarians seems to be about13.5 percent.\n\n",
