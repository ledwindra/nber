Social Implications of Fiscal Policy Responses During Crises

NBER Working Paper No. 19828
January 2014
JEL No. E62,F41
ABSTRACT
This paper studies the social implications of fiscal policy responses to crises in Latin America over
the last 40 years and in the Eurozone during the aftermath of the global financial crisis. We focus on
the behavior of four social indicators: the poverty rate, income inequality, unemployment rate, and
domestic conflict. We find a causal link from counteryclical (procyclical) fiscal policy responses to
reductions (increases) in all four social indicators. These results call into question recent claims on
"expansionary fiscal austerity."

Introduction

It is well established by now that developing countries have typically pursued procyclical …scal policy (i.e., expansionary …scal policy in good times
and contractionary …scal policy in bad times), which has tended to amplify
the underlying business cycle.1 In particular, contractionary …scal policy
in bad times has increased the severity and duration of crises.2 Ironically,
the procyclicality of …scal policy has also become a hotly debated issue in
the context of the current crisis in Europe, with in‡uential economists such
as Olivier Blanchard (IMF Chief Economist) arguing that …scal multipliers in the Eurozone have been underestimated by the IMF and others and
hence that the contractionary e¤ects of …scal austerity have been considerably higher.3
Lost in much of the discussion on procyclical …scal policy has been the
e¤ect on social indicators, such as unemployment, income inequality, and
poverty rate. Surely, part of the reason has been the lack of readily available time-series data on social indicators to match the existing macro-data
on …scal variables and GDP. More generally, the fact that much of the discussion on …scal procyclicality has focused on either the issue of causality
(i.e., does GDP cause government spending or is it the other way around?)
or why countries are procyclical (i.e., is it imperfections in international capital markets or domestic political-economy factors?) seems to have left little
scope to broaden the discussion and look at the possible interaction between
…scal procyclicality and the behavior of social indicators.4
This paper is a …rst attempt at …lling this void by looking at how …scal

procyclicality during crises may a¤ect the behavior of social indicators. For
these purposes, we follow Vegh and Vuletin (2013) and focus primarily on
the …scal policy response to crises in Latin America over the last 40 years.
In that paper, we argue that the evidence shows that, on average, Latin
American countries have “graduated” in terms of their …scal and monetary
response to crises, in the sense that they have switched from procyclical
policy responses before 1998 to countercyclical policy responses after 1998.
This average response, however, masks quite a bit of heterogeneity across
countries, ranging from cases such as Chile and Brazil, which have graduated
on both the monetary and …scal front, to cases such Argentina and Uruguay,
which have shown consistently procyclical policy responses before and after
1998. We further argue that countercyclical policy responses, particularly
on the …scal side, have tended to reduce the duration and intensity of crises.
In this paper, we complement our previous analysis by looking at how
the …scal policy response to crises has a¤ected social indicators such as the
poverty rate, income inequality, the unemployment rate, and domestic con‡ict. Following Vegh and Vuletin (2013), Section 2 provides an operational
de…nition of “crisis” and applies it to our sample of eight Latin American
countries.5 By so doing, we identify 34 crises and characterize their average
duration and intensity. Since casual analysis for countries such as Chile and
others in the region suggests a policy shift around the year 2000, we choose
the year 1998 (a year without any GDP crisis) to divide our sample into a
“before” and “after.” We show that the frequency, duration, and intensity
of crises in Latin America has fallen in the post-1998 period.
In Section 3, we then show that, on average, Latin America’s …scal policy
responses to crises has shifted from being procyclical before 1998 to being
countercyclical after 1998. In this sense, therefore, we could argue that, on
average, Latin America has graduated in terms of the …scal policy response to
5

As detailed in Section 2, our de…nition is based on the behavior of GDP, so these are,
strictly speaking, “GDP crises.” However, they typically coincide with well-known crises
episodes.

crises. This average response, however, masks a great deal of heterogeneity
within our sample, with countries such as Chile and Brazil (and, to some
extent, Mexico) leading the way in this graduation process and countries
such as Argentina, Uruguay, and Venezuela still showing heavily procyclical
policy responses.
Section 4 then looks at the behavior of social indicators during the crises.
Speci…cally, we look at the behavior during crises of the change in (i) the
poverty rate, (ii) the ratio of the richest 10 percent to the poorest 10 percent,
(iii) the unemployment rate, and (iv) domestic con‡ict before and after 1998.
In general, we see a fairly consistent picture across countries, with Brazil,
Chile, and Mexico being the set of countries where poverty, income inequality,
unemployment, and domestic con‡ict have increased the least during crises
in the post-1998 period and, to the extent that data are available, where
we see smaller increases in all four social indicators in the post-1998 period
compared to the pre-1998 period. It is also true that, on average, these social
indicators have increased less (or even fallen) during the crises in the pre-1998
period compared to the post-1998 period and the recent global crisis.
In Section 5, we examine the role of …scal policy in bringing about a reduction (or a smaller increase) in all four social indicators during crises. In other
words, can countercyclical …scal policy attenuate the increase in poverty, income inequality, unemployment, and domestic con‡ict during crises? We
show that there is a statistically signi…cant relationship between the degree
of cyclicality of …scal policy and social indicators, in that the more procyclical is …scal policy, the more our four social indicators increase. However,
since correlations do not imply causation, we construct a measure of …scal
space (which we label a “…scal readiness index”) that acts for an instrument
for …scal policy. We conclude that it is indeed a more countercyclical …scal
policy response that leads to a reduction (or smaller increase) in poverty,
income inequality, unemployment, and domestic con‡ict during crises.
In Section 6, we turn our attention to the current Eurozone crisis to

4

argue that countries such as Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal have been
pursuing procyclical (i.e., contractionary) …scal policy, as Latin American
countries used to do (and still do to some extent). We provide evidence in
the form of a …scal readiness index that suggests that this procyclical …scal
policy has led to higher unemployment and more domestic con‡ict.
Section 7 o¤ers some concluding remarks.

Crises in Latin America: De…nition and basic statistics

Following Vegh and Vuletin (2013), our sample for Latin American countries
consists of what is commonly referred to as LAC-7 (Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela) and Uruguay. The combined GDP
of these 8 economies accounts for almost 93 percent of the Latin American
and the Caribbean region’s GDP. Table 1 lists the sample period for each of
these countries. Unfortunately –and mainly due to the need to have quarterly data for our analysis –the sample period di¤ers across countries. For
Argentina, for instance, our sample starts in 1970:1, whereas for Venezuela
it starts in 1998:1. For all countries except Venezuela, however, our sample
starts in 1980 or earlier, which gives us at least 33 years of quarterly data.
Analyzing policy responses to “crises” naturally requires de…ning a “crisis”. For our purposes, we will de…ne a crisis as beginning in the quarter
in which real GDP falls below the preceding 4-quarter moving average and
ending in the quarter in which real GDP reaches the pre-crisis level. As
indicated in Table 1, using this de…nition we identify 34 crises in our 8 Latin
American countries. The countries with the largest number of crises are
Argentina and Brazil (7 crises each) and the country with the least number
of crisis is Colombia (2 crises). Given the di¤erent sample periods (and
the di¤erent duration of each individual crisis), the table also reports the
frequency of crises (de…ned as the number of quarters that a given country
5

is in crisis over the total number of quarters in the sample period). By this
metric, Argentina is the country with the highest frequency of crises (0.49),
implying that, over the last 43 years, it has been in one crisis or another half
of the time, while Colombia is the country with the lowest frequency (0.13).
Table 1 also reports the average duration of crises, which is 11 quarters for
the whole sample. Uruguay exhibits the longest average duration (18 quarters). The average intensity of crises (measured as the fall in the level of
GDP from the start of the crisis to the trough) is 8.6 percent, with Uruguay
also having the largest average intensity (14.8 percent).
If we take 1998 as our before-and-after date, how has the frequency, duration, and intensity of crises change?6 Panel A in Figure 1 shows the
frequency of crises before and after 1998 for each of our 8 Latin American
countries. On average, we seem to observe higher frequencies before than
after 1998. This visual impression is con…rmed by Figure 2, Panel A, where
we can see that the average frequency of crises fell from 0.42 before 1998 to
0.29 afterwards. As an additional datapoint, the …gure also shows that the
frequency of crises after 2008 has been 0.23.
Panel B in Figure 1 shows the average duration of crises for our 8 Latin
American countries before and after 1998. Once again, the visual impression
appears to suggest that the average duration has fallen after 1998. This is
con…rmed in Figure 2, Panel B, where we see that the overall average duration
of crises before 1998 (14 quarters) falls to 8 quarters after 1998.
Finally, Panel C in Figure 1 shows the average intensity of crises for our 8
Latin American countries. As was the case with frequency and duration, the
visual impression conveyed by the plot is that the intensity has diminished
6

While admittedly arbitrary, the choice of 1998 seemed a natural one. First –and as
discussed in Frankel, Vegh, and Vuletin (2013) – the late 1990’s appears to have been a
period where one can detect (through formal regressions using institutional quality as an
explanatory variable) a shift in …scal policy (from procyclical to countercyclical). Within
this period, 1998 seemed a natural candidate because no crisis took place in that year
providing us with a clean break in the series. We also wanted to leave a reasonably large
window (15 years in this case) where one can observe the “after” e¤ects.

after 1998. This is con…rmed by Figure 2, Panel B, where we can see that
the overall average fall in GDP (from the start of the crisis to the trough)
before 1998 was 11 percent, compared to just 7 percent after 1998.
In sum, the evidence clearly suggests that the frequency, duration, and
intensity of crises in Latin America has fallen in the post-1998 period. We
now turn to analyzing how the …scal policy response may have varied over
time.

Fiscal policy response

We now review the response of …scal policy to crises. Figure 3 shows for
each of the eight countries in the sample the average correlation during crises
periods between the cyclical component of government spending and GDP
before and after 1998.7 The …gure is very revealing, as it pinpoints three
countries (Brazil, Chile, and Mexico) that have clearly switched from having
a procyclical …scal policy response before 1998 to a countercyclical policy
response after 1998. Not coincidentally, these are countries that are often
hailed in the …nancial press for having considerably improved their macroeconomic management over the years. The other …ve countries show procyclical
…scal response after 1998, with Argentina, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela exhibiting particularly large ones.8

Behavior of social indicators

This section looks at the behavior of social indicators during the crises
episodes de…ned in the previous section. Speci…cally, Figure 4 shows the
behavior of four social indicators (change in poverty rate, change in ratio of

Notice that a positive (negative) correlation implies procyclical (countercyclical) …scal
policy.

We should note that Colombia did not have GDP crises before 1998 and we do not
have data for Venezuela before 1998.

richest 10 percent to poorest 10 percent, change in the unemployment rate,
and change in domestic con‡ict) before and after 1998.
Panel A illustrates the change in the poverty rate. We can see that in
three cases (Brazil, Chile, and Mexico) the change in the poverty rate in the
post-1998 period has been in fact slightly negative, indicating little change in
the poverty rate during crises. As we will conjecture below, this could be due
to countercyclical …scal policies aimed at alleviating poverty in bad times.
This post-1998 behavior stands in sharp contrast to the pre-1998 behavior
for Brazil and Mexico (we do not have data for Chile), when the changes in
the poverty rate were quite large. We then have countries such as Argentina,
Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, where the pre- and post-1998 data
is qualitatively the same (Argentina and Peru) or the numbers are positive
after 1998 (Colombia, Uruguay, and Venezuela).
Panel B shows the change in the ratio of the richest 10 percent to the
poorest 10 percent. While less data are available than for Panel A, the
behavior is remarkably similar, with Brazil, Mexico, and Chile exhibiting
the smallest changes after 1998 (the change in Brazil and Mexico are actually negative) and the remaining …ve countries showing consistently higher
numbers.
A more complete picture emerges from Panel C as we have pre- and post1998 data for all eight countries. Here we see in fact …ve countries (Brazil,
Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay) where the change in the unemployment
rate is quite a bit smaller post-1998 than pre-1998. In terms of magnitudes,
though, it is still the case that, in the post-1998 period, the …gures are the
smallest in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico (in addition to Peru).
Finally, Panel D shows the change in domestic con‡ict (computed relative
to the historical average to control for “…xed country e¤ects” so to speak).
Once again, in the post-1998 period, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico show the
smallest (actually negative) changes.
In sum, we see a fairly consistent picture across countries, with Brazil,

8

Chile, and Mexico being the set of countries where (i) poverty, income inequality, unemployment, and domestic con‡ict have increased the least (or
fallen) during crises in the post-1998 period, and (ii) to the extent that data
are available, where we see a shift in the behavior of our social indicators
from the pre- to the post-1998 period, with smaller increases (or falls) in the
latter period.
Figure 5 shows the corresponding changes in the averages for Latin America. The picture is qualitatively the same for all four indicators: while all
positive, the average change in the post-1998 period is smaller than in the
pre-1998 period. The …gure also shows the changes for the period after 2008
(the global …nancial crisis) and in this case three of the four variables are
actually negative.

The role of …scal policy

We have seen that, on average, poverty, income inequality, unemployment,
and domestic con‡ict have increased less (or fallen) during crises in the pre1998 period compared to the post-1998 period or the recent global crisis.
But we see quite a bit of variation across countries. For empirical purposes,
of course, this variation is welcome because it will enable us to see if we
can link the behavior of …scal policy during crises to the changes in social
indicators.
Figure 6 shows the scatter plots of the cyclicality of …scal policy –captured
by the correlation between the cyclical components of GDP and government
spending –against each of the four social indicators. In each case, we see a
positive and statistically signi…cant relationship (at least at the 10 percent
level) indicating that the more procyclical is …scal policy, the larger is the
increase in poverty, income inequality, unemployment, and domestic con‡ict.
Since correlations do not imply causation, we now proceed to argue that
it is actually the change in …scal policy that is causing the change in social

9

indicators. In other words, we wish to interpret these scatter plots as implying that a countercyclical …scal policy leads to a smaller increase (or bigger
fall) in poverty, income inequality, unemployment, and domestic con‡ict. To
this e¤ect – and, again, following Vegh and Vuletin (2013) – we construct
a “…scal readiness index” which is basically an index of initial conditions
that captures the “…scal space” that countries may have before a crisis to
pursue countercyclical …scal policy during the crisis. This index attempts
to measure the soundness of …scal policy during the eight quarters (or two
calendar years for annual indicators) preceding a crisis. This index is comprised of 3 components, each normalized between 0 and 10, which implies
that the index may range between 0 (lowest …scal readiness) and 30 (highest
…scal readiness).9 The three components are: (i) sovereign credit ratings,
(ii) …scal de…cit as percentage of GDP, and (iii) total (public plus private)
external debt as percentage of GDP.10
Technically, we want to use the …scal readiness index as an instrument for
…scal policy. In other words, we want to have a variable that satis…es two
conditions: (i) it is highly correlated with the countercyclical …scal policy
response and (ii) it can a¤ect the social indicators only through its e¤ect on
the …scal policy response. The correlation between the …scal policy response
and the …scal readiness index is -0.50 and hence the …rst condition is indeed
satis…ed. Further, we would argue that our index also satis…es the second
condition because it is computed before the crisis begins and is composed of
essentially backward-looking variables. Hence, it cannot directly a¤ect the
change in social indicators that takes place after the crisis has begun.
Figure 7 then plots the correlation between the predicted cyclicality of
9

We pool together data for Latin American and Eurozone countries to facilitate crosscountry comparisons. The only exception in which the lower bound (i.e., worst scenario)
of the normalization is carrried out at the regional level is for total (public plus private)
external debt as percentage of GDP. The value for this variable in some European countries
(such as Ireland in recent times) is close to 1,000 percent of GDP, while the highest value
for Latin American economies is about 50 percent of GDP.

…scal policy (using our instrument above) and each of the four social indicators. We can see that the relationship is positive in all cases. Further,
in two of the cases (poverty rate and domestic con‡ict), the relationship is
also signi…cant at the …ve percent level. We thus conclude that our …ndings
support the notion that the causality runs from the …scal policy response to
the behavior of social indicators.

6

Europe: more of the same?

We now look at the current European crisis and ask whether our main …nding
for Latin America (i.e., the …scal policy response matters for how social
indicators behave during a crisis) holds for this case. Figure 8 shows the
duration and intensity of the current crisis for 10 Eurozone countries. As of
the …rst quarter of 2013 (the last quarter for GDP in our sample), the crisis
is ongoing for 7 of the 10 countries and is at least 18 quarters old (Panel
A). Panel B shows the intensity, with Greece having lost 24 percent of GDP
from the start of the crisis to the trough (last quarter in the sample). The
average intensity for the current Eurozone crises is 8.4 percent, which roughly
coincides with the average intensity of crises in Latin America (8.6 percent,
from Table 1).
How did …scal policy react to the crisis? Figure 9 shows our measure
of …scal policy cyclicality (i.e., the correlation between the cyclical components of government spending and real GDP during crises) for each of the
10 countries. We can see that four countries – Greece, Ireland, Italy, and
Portugal – have been procyclical in their response. In other words, they
have contracted …scal spending during the crisis (part of a “…scal consolidation,” to use today’s jargon). In contrast, the other 6 countries embarked
in countercyclical …scal policy, with Germany leading the way. So, like in
Latin America, we have quite a bit of heterogeneity in the …scal response to
the crisis.

11

In terms of social indicators, Figure 10, Panel A, shows the changes in
unemployment in 10 Eurozone countries.11 As expected, the biggest changes
have taken place in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. This is
largely consistent with Panel B, which plots the changes in domestic con‡ict,
with Greece and Spain truly standing out.
The question now becomes: has procyclical …scal policy led to a larger
increase in unemployment and domestic con‡ict during the crisis? Figure 11
provides an answer to this question by plotting the index of …scal cyclicality
against the change in unemployment (Panel A) and the change in domestic
con‡ict (Panel B). We see that the relationship is positive and statistically
signi…cant at, at least, the 10 percent level in both cases. In other words,
these relationships are consistent with the idea that a procyclical …scal response in the Eurozone has led to an increase in unemployment and domestic
con‡ict.
Figure 11, however, could re‡ect reverse causality. To address this issue
–and as we did for Latin American countries above –we compute the …scal
readiness index for our 10 Eurozone countries (Figure 12). In Figure 13,
we then show a highly signi…cant correlation between the …scal readiness
index and …scal policy, as captured by the correlation between the cyclical
component of government spending and real GDP. This is tantamount to
saying that we have a valid instrument. Finally, in Figure 14 we show
a signi…cant relation between our instrument for …scal readiness and the
duration (Panel A) and intensity (Panel B) of crises. We thus conclude that,
indeed, procyclical …scal policy in some Eurozone crises has contributed to
making the current crisis more socially costly (both in terms of unemployment
and social con‡ict), much like in Latin America before the late 1990s/early
2000s.

The countries are Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Data sources consist mainly of WEO as well as Global
Financial Database.

Conclusions

This paper started from the observation that the …scal policy response to
crises has dramatically shifted around the world recently. Many Latin American countries (like Chile, Brazil, and Mexico) have graduated in terms of
their …scal responses to GDP crises, in the sense that they have switched
from a procyclical to a countercyclical response. On the other hand, many
advanced economies (like Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal) have followed
contractionary …scal policies in the aftermath of the global …nancial crisis.
In Vegh and Vuletin (2013), we presented evidence that strongly suggests
that …scal austerity policies lead to longer and deeper GDP crises, whereas
…scal stimulus policies imply shorter and shallower recessions. These …ndings support recent evidence that …scal multipliers are larger than previously
thought (particularly during recessions) and do not support the so-called
“expansionary austerity”hypothesis, put forward by many studies.12
Our main focus in this paper has been on the e¤ects of …scal policy responses to crises on social outcomes, a topic that has received little attention
so far and that is of critical policy importance. We …nd that countercyclical
…scal policies tend to attenuate the increases in poverty, income inequality,
unemployment, and domestic con‡ict during GDP crises. On the other
hand, austerity packages tend to exacerbate even more the rise in all four
social indicators. Moreover, we have also shown that countries’ ability to
react countercyclically during GDP crises crucially depends on their …scal
12

Our …nding that countercyclical …scal policy has helped in reducing the duration and
intensity of GDP crises is, of course, related to the issue of how big are …scal multipliers; see,
for instance, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2011), Ilzetzki, Mendoza, and Vegh (2013),
and the references therein.
In fact, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2011) argue that
multipliers are larger in bad times than in good times. Riera-Crichton, Vegh, and Vuletin
(2013) further suggest that it may matter whether government spending is going up or
down and show that, at least for OECD countries, …scal multipliers are even bigger in
bad times when government spending is actually increasing. Riera-Crichton, Vegh, and
Vuletin (2012) also show that (when properly measured) tax increases associated with
…scal consolidation episodes are very contractionary.

13

space. By constructing a simple …scal readiness index, we have shown that
countries which were able to follow sound …scal and macroeconomic policies
in the period before a crisis are, not surprisingly, those which are more prepared to actively use …scal policy to reduce the length and intensity of a crisis
as well as the impact on social indicators.

Unemployment rate
Unemployment rate refers to the share of the labor force that is without
work but seeking employment.
Domestic con‡ict
Domestic con‡ict is an index that corresponds to variable “weighted con‡ict measures”from Cross-National Time-Series (CNTS) data and comprises
the following dimensions: assassinations, strikes, guerrilla warfare, government crisis, purges, riots, revolutions, and anti-government demonstrations.
Change in domestic con‡ict is calculated with respect to historical average.
Domestic con‡ict ranges between -565 and 2433. Change in domestic con‡ict
is calculated with respect to each country’s historical average.

Computation of …scal readiness index

This appendix describes the computation of the …scal readiness index. The
three components are: (i) sovereign credit ratings, (ii) …scal de…cit as a
percentage of GDP, and (iii) total (public plus private) external debt as a
percentage of GDP.
Sovereign credit ratings contribute to the index by providing markets’
perception about the risk associated with government debt. We use Moody’s
quarterly data ratings for long-term debt in foreign currency. High numerical
values of this component are associated with high ratings (such as Aaa),
whereas low numerical scores are associated with low debt ratings such as
C. For these purposes, we group Moody’s ratings into 9 categories: prime
rating (Aaa), high grade (Aa1, Aa2, Aa3), upper medium grade (A1, A2, A3),
lower medium grade (Baa1, Baa2, Baa3), non-investment grade speculative
(Ba1, Ba2, Ba3), non-investment grade highly speculative (B1, B2, B3), noninvestment grade substantial risk (Caa1, Caa2, Caa3), non-investment grade
extremely speculative (Ca1, Ca2, Ca3), and in default (C1, C2, C3).
Fiscal de…cit as a percentage of GDP aims at capturing short-run …scal
limitations and current debt build up. Source: World Economic Outlook
(IMF)
Total (public plus private) external debt as a percentage of GDP contributes to the index by providing a measure of the economy’s total debt
(public plus private), which proxies not only for public default risk but also
for the possibility of bailouts of the …nancial sector. Source: Carmen Reinhart’s website and World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics.
