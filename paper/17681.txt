The Contribution of China, India and Brazil to Narrowing North-South Differences in GDP/capita,
World Trade Shares, and Market Capitalization

ABSTRACT
This paper focuses on the contribution to recent narrowing of the gap between Northern and Southern
economies in GDP/capita, shares in world trade and market capitalization attributable both jointly
and single to China, India, and Brazil (the three currently largest rapidly growing Southern economies).
We report NorthSouth differences in GDP/capita which (depending slightly on definition of North
and South, as well as price deflators used) fall from 22 to 15.9 in constant USD between 1990 and
2009, changing Northern and Southern shares in world trade which fall for the North from 82.3% to
64.4% and rise for the South from 17.7% to 35.6%, and a changing North-South gap in stock market
capitalizations from 27.6 to 3.3 over the same time. In contrast the North-China gap falls from 57.2
to 13.1 between 1990 and 2009, and India from 70.4 to 38.1 using market exchange rates and from
23.4 to 5.5 for China and from 20.7 to 11.4 for India using PPP rates. We calculate the portions of
North-South gap change after 1990 which is accounted for by growth individually and jointly of China,
India, and Brazil. Our calculations show that the majority of the change occurs from growth in these
three economies, and the most from China. We suggest that the conventional view of a North-South
bipolar world may need recasting into a tripolar world of the North, the Large South, and the rest of
the South. In this, world manufacturing activity, trade, and even more rapidly, market capitalization
are gravitating towards the Large Three, with a narrowing South-Large Three gap as well as a shrinking
North-Large Three gap.

1. Introduction
There is a large recent body of literature that focuses on Brazil, China and
India’s growing presence in the world economy (Antkiewicz & Whalley, 2005, 2006;
Broadman, 2008; Bussolo et al, 2007; Jenkins & Edwards, 2006; Kaplinsky & Messner,
2008; McDonald et al, 2008; Nayyar, 2009; Nenci, 2008; Whalley, 2006; Yusuf et al,
2006). However, what is less well documented is the contribution that Brazil, China
and India have made to narrowing North‐South differences in GDP/capita, world
trade and market capitalization. In recent years, Brazil, China and India have grown
faster than other economies, their trade has expanded and they have become large
recipients of FDI inflows (Amann, 2011; Baer, 2008; Naughton, 2007; Qureshi et al,
2008; Srinivasan, 2004, 2006). They also play an increasing important role in global
governance (Gu et al, 2008; Qin, 2008).
Here we report calculations which (depending slightly on definitions of
country groups) suggest a narrowing in the North‐South gap in GDP/capita between
1990 and 2009 of roughly 28%. We suggest that much (and even most) of this change
can be accounted for by growth in China, India and Brazil, and primarily China. The
per capita income gap between the North and China narrows from 64.4 in 1990 to
10.6 in 2009 when calculated at market exchange rates, from 57.2 to 13.1 using
constant 2000 USD, and from 23.4 to 5.5 over the same time using purchasing power
parity (constant 2005 international $) rates. Even more rapidly changing are the
Southern shares in world stock market capitalization and in world trade.
In addition, interactions among the large Southern economies are
proceeding even more quickly than these changes. Wang and Whalley (2011)
recently presented data on China's trade and investment flows with Southern
countries, which indicate China’s Southern exports grew at 42% in 2007 in contrast to
26% for all exports, and that China‐India trade and China‐Brazil trade grew 33 fold
and 18 fold respectively between 1995 and 2007. Medianu and Whalley (2010) also
report that Brazil’s export share to China grows from 3% in 2001 to 15% in 2010,
while the US share of their exports falls from 25% to 10% over the same period.
What our calculations underline is that the world economy is shifting at an
2

accelerating rate towards the large South, and with it, are rapidly growing economic
and financial links that are emerging among the large Southern countries. This is an
expanding large South and relative shrinking North in a tripolar world in which the
Large South‐Rest of South gap is also rapidly changing. We also report projections
which suggest a further sharp escalation of these trends over the next two decades if
current relative country growth rates persist.

2. The Changing North‐South Gap in GDP/capita, the Contribution of China, India,
and Brazil and Forward Projections of the Gap
The North‐South divide signifies a socio‐economic and political division that
effectively divides the world between the rich and the poor. Wealthy developed
countries known collectively as the North (or the First World) and the poorer
developing countries known as the South (the Third World) traverse this divide1.
Although most countries in the North are located in the Northern Hemisphere (with
the exceptions of Australia and New Zealand), the divide is not wholly defined by
geography since many so called Southern developing countries are geographically
Northern. The terms North and South thus need careful definition. Commonly,
developed countries are referred as the North and others as the South (see
Dinopoulos & Segerstrom, 2006; Ratna, 2009, and etc); but as OECD (2006)
emphasizes there is no established convention for the designation of individual
countries or areas as developed or developing.
Here we adopt IMF country groupings in calculating North‐South and also
country‐group gaps in GDP/capita at market prices for recent years. We also compare
the size of the gap under other classifications. The IMF divides the world into 33
advanced economies and developing countries in its World Economy Outlook (WEO)
report (IMF, 2010)2. We take IMF advanced economies as the North, and the rest of
the world as the South. We also divide the North into two sub‐groups of the G7 and
the Rest of North, and the South into the Large Three (China, India and Brazil, the
largest Southern countries in 2007 GDP size), Oil Exporters, and Rest of South. Oil
exporters are members of OPEC and Russia.
The behavior of this divide over long periods of time has also recently been
1

The North-South debate, as it came to be known during the 1970s, was essentially over the policy changes that
would enable the South to rapidly achieve self-sustaining economic growth and industrialization (Adam Sneyd,
http://www.globalautonomy.ca/global1/glossary_entry.jsp?id=CO.0063). The term North- South became popularly
used after the publication in 1980 of ‘The Brandt Report’ (The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, 1987).
2
The main criteria seemingly used by the WEO to classify the world into advanced and emerging/developing
economies are: (1) per capita income, (2) degree of export diversification--so oil exporters that have high per
capita GDP do not make the advanced classification because around 70% of exports are oil, and (3) degree of
integration into the global financial system. Under the first criteria, they look at an average over a number of years
given that volatility (due to say oil production) can have a marked year-to-year effect. These are not the only
factors considered in deciding the classification of countries. The WEO Statistical Appendix states "Rather than
being based on strict criteria, economic or otherwise, this classification has evolved over time with the objective of
facilitating analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful organization of data." Reclassification only happens
when something marked changes or the case for change becomes overwhelming. For example, Malta joining the
euro area was a significant change in circumstances that warranted a reclassification from an emerging and
developing economy to an advanced economy. See http://forums.imf.org/showthread.php?t=154

studied by Maddison (2008) who divides the world into two major groups the “Rich”
and the “Rest”. The countries that belong to the “Rich” are Western Europe, USA,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. The “Rest” is China, India, Other Asia,
Latina America, Eastern Europe and the former USSR, and Africa. He reports
GDP/capita for the “Rich”, the “Rest” as well as subgroups and a Rich/Rest spread
between 1000 and 2003 AD in 1990 international dollars. Maddison a little
surprisingly suggests that in 1000 AD the Rich had GDP/capita lower than the Rest
with a Rich/Rest spread of 0.9:1. Their situation had reversed itself by 1820 via the
industrial revolution when the Rich had GDP/capita almost twice that of the Rest. The
Rich/Rest spread then increased by 1973 to 6.7:1 and to 6.9:1 by 1990. In 2003
Maddison estimates that the Rich/Rest spread had decreased to 6.1:1. Most of our
later calculations produce considerably larger gaps than Maddison since they are
using market exchange rates rather than PPP exchange rates, but as in his
calculations we show that the differences between the Rich and the Rest narrowed in
the last 2‐3 decades and also as in to Maddison that they will narrow further by 2030
when the Rich/Rest spread will be 4.4:1.
Given these points of background, Table 2‐1 reports our calculations of
North‐South and North‐Large Three gaps in GDP/Capita between 1990 and 2009 in
current USD terms, as well as individual country‐North gaps. These show that using
GDP in constant US dollar or market exchange rates the North‐South GDP/capita gap
narrowed from 22.1 to 15.9 (28% less) between 1990 and 2009, while the gap
between the North and the Large Three narrowed from 39.3 to 16.6 (58% less).
Among the Large Three, China grew the most rapidly in GDP/capita and narrowed its
difference with the North from 57.2 in 1990 to 13.1 in 2009 (77% less). Smaller gaps
apply if purchasing power parity rates are used (see below).

Taking a longer time frame, Table 2‐2 reports the North‐South GDP/capita
gap at market exchange rates as well as at PPP exchange rates over the decades
1960s to 2000s. The average GDP/capita gap between the North and South, as well
as between North and the Large Three, widened after the 1960s, and reached a peak
in 1970s and narrowed quickly in the 2000s. The average North‐China gap in the
2000s was less half than in the 1960s measured in market exchange rates and less
one third measured in PPP exchange rates; however, the North‐Brazil gap widened
slowly over time.

North/South

The GDP/capita gaps from 1990 to 2009 between Northern sub groups and
the South and Large Three are reported in Table 2‐3. The G7‐South and G7‐Large
Three gaps in GDP/capita narrowed after 1990, especially in recent years. The
G7‐Large Three gap narrowed by 59% from 44.4 to 18.2 between 1990 and 2009,
while China narrowing its gap with the G7 by 78% over the same time. The picture
revealed for gap between the Rest of the North and the Large Three is similar.
Though the Rest of North experienced faster growth in GDP/capita than the G7, its
difference with China still narrowed by over 74% over 1990 to 2009.

To assess the sensitivity of these gaps measures to the choice of country
groupings, Table 2‐4 reports the North‐South gap in GDP per capita in current USD
terms for different country classifications. In contrast to the IMF, the World Bank
(2010)1 uses Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (calculated using a method set
out in the World Bank) to divide the world into four groups. Its group of high income
countries contains 69 countries (including territories) with GNI per capita in 2009 of
$12,196 or higher. The United Nation Development Programme (UNDP, 2010)
classifies countries into four groups according to their human development levels but
calculates their annual Human Development Index (HDI) using GNI per capita in
purchasing power parity (PPP) terms along with indicators of education and health.
Its group of very high human development countries is a developed country grouping
and contains 42 countries in 2010. The CIA (2008) in classifying countries uses a
country grouping similar to the UNDP but does not explicitly state its criteria in
classifying countries.
In addition, we also consider the North as high income countries following
the World Bank and the UNDP as Very High HDI economies. We then use two
additional classifications of countries for sensitivity purposes. One takes OECD
1

members as the North. The other takes Oil Exporters as defined above and IMF
advanced economies together as the North, since many oil exporters have high
income levels and some of them are developed countries in the World Band and
UNDP classifications.

Table 2‐4 reports gap measures for five alternative North and South
classifications. These suggest the same trend in the North‐South gap and show little
difference, except for the IMF based classification in the earlier years. The peak of
North‐South gap using IMF classification is 25 in 1988, while peaks using other
classification are all shown in 1992. The gap in 1992 is the second biggest for the IMF
classification over the period 1960 and 2009.
Thus, no matter what classification used, the North‐South GDP/capita gap
narrowed after the mid 1990s and shows convergence in recent years. Further more,
the North‐South GDP/capita gap between 1960s and 1980s using the IMF country
classification is significantly larger than gaps based on other classifications before the
1990s and moves closer to others afterwards. Thus, the North‐South gap using the
IMF country classification shows a similar trend to that measured using other
classifications, with a slightly less pronounced rise and fall over time. The
North‐South division using the IMF classification is fixed over time, while the division
using other classifications changes every year. Since comparable benchmarks for the
North‐South GDP/capita gap are best provided on a consistent basis using the IMF
classification, we use the IMF advanced economies as the North and rest of the world
8

9.8

as the South in the following calculations.
There is, however, substantial sensitivity in North‐South gap measures for
GDP per capita to both price deflators and the use of purchase power parity
measures of exchange rates compared to those based on market exchange rates.
Impacts on measured North‐South gaps of GDP per capita are reported in Table 2‐5.
The gap measured in constant price terms is generally almost twice that using PPP.
There are smaller differences between gaps measures using market prices or
constant prices, than between PPP current price and PPP constant price measures.
These differences reflect the feature that developing countries usually experience
higher inflation and larger exchange rate/PPP distortions.

The trends in the North‐South GDP/capita gap after 1970 that we report
here are comparable to Maddison (2008) but there are significant differences in
magnitude between the calculations. Maddison (2008) measures GDP/capita using
different price deflators and different PPPs, and also uses a different classification of
9

the Rich. Our calculations are reported using current USD, constant 2000 USD, PPP
current international $ and PPP constant 2005 international $. Our calculations in
PPP are closer to Maddison’s estimates of the Rich/Rest spread which are reported in
1990 international PPP dollars. A difference from Maddison is that we include in the
“Rich” group Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore and this results in a
slight widening of the North‐South gap relative to Maddison.
The GDP/capita gap between Southern groups has also been changing over
time. Table 2‐6 indicates the rapidly changing GDP/capita gap between the South and
Large Three. The Large Three gap relative to the South has been narrowing since the
1960s, and especially so in the 2000s. The share of the Large Three in total Southern
GDP increased by 27% in the last 10 years. Among the Large Three, the South‐China
gap narrowed quickly after the 1960s and is only 0.8 in 2009 instead of 4.6 in the
1960s. South‐India gap widened slowly before the 1990s, but has narrowed quickly in
recent years.

South /Large Three

Comparing the North‐South gap in GDP/capita above with South‐South gap,
the common characteristic is China consistently narrowing its gap with other groups,
no matter whether it is the North, South or the G7. Before the 1990s the Large Three
narrowed its difference with North and G7 faster than with the South, afterward the
South‐Large Three gap narrowed more slowly than the North‐Large Three gap. A
reason is that Southern GDP/capita grew faster, driven by China’s fast growth (as well
as lower population growth for China due to its population control) alongside India’s
fast growth since the 1990s.
10

Next we turn to the contribution of China, India and Brazil to the changing
North‐South gap in GDP per capita. As the largest changes in the North‐South
GDP/capita gap have occurred after the 1990s, we calculate what the changes in the
North‐South gaps would have been between 1990 and 2009 under various
counterfactual GDP growth assumptions for the Large Three. We assume they grew
since 1990 alternatively at the same rates as the whole South, the world, the South
excluding the Large Three, or zero, instead of their actual growth rates.

22.1

24.0

Results are reported in Table 2‐7. The North‐South gap in GDP/capita
presents a similar trend no matter measured in what price deflators, and here we
only report results using constant 2000 USD. The counterfactual gaps in Table 2‐7
show that rapid GDP growth of the Large Three contributed significantly in narrowing
North‐South gap in GDP/capita after 1990. If China, India and Brazil all had no GDP
growth since 1990, the North‐South gap in GDP/capita would have increased to 23.8

11

in 2009 instead of declining to 15.9. The North‐Large Three gap would have increased
from 39.3 in 1990 to 63.6 in 2009, instead of decreasing to 16.6. If the GDP of the
Large Three had grown as the world or the South excluding Large Three after 1990,
then the North‐South and North‐Large Three gap in GDP/capita would essentially not
show any change between 1990 and 2009. If the Large Three had grown as the South,
then the North‐South gap would have widened slightly while the North‐Large Three
gap would have narrowed to 27.1 in 2009, much larger than actual gap of 16.6.
We also investigate the contribution of China, India and Brazil individually in
narrowing the North‐South gap in GDP/capita after 1990. Results are reported in
Table 2‐8. Similarly to Table 2‐7, we assume that individual countries (China, India or
Brazil) grew as the world or no growth since 1990 respectively and we investigate
how the counterfactual North‐South gaps in GDP/capita would have evolved.
If China had grown as the world in GDP after 1990, the North‐South gap in
GDP/capita would have only narrowed slightly instead of narrowing 30% between
1990 and 2009. Also, the North‐Large Three gap would have narrowed by around
20%, instead of having narrowed 79% over the same time frame. If India or Brazil had
grown at the world rate individually after 1990, the North‐South gap would have
widened slightly more.
Without growth in China, India or Brazil after 1990, the North‐South gap in
capita would have widened significantly. Among these three countries, China’s high
growth contributed most with an 81% contribution in narrowing the North‐South gap.
Without China’s growth, the North‐South gap would be 20.9 rather than the actual
gap of 15.9 in 2009. India had contributed less than China, and Brazil the least.
Without growth of India or Brazil, the North‐South gap would widen from 15.9 to
16.9 or 16.5 in 2009 respectively. Another feature noticeable in the Table 2‐8 is that
no matter at what counterfactual speed China, India and Brazil grew individually, the
North‐South and North‐Large Three gaps in GDP/capita show the same trend of
decreasing over time less than the actual gaps. This reflects that the relative
reduction of China, India and Brazil in overall GDP/capita in the South, in other words,
a more balanced development among the Southern countries after 1990.

We have also undertaken two simple projections of future gaps assuming
either unchanged country growth rates or an unchanged speed of narrowing in gaps
to assess what might happen to these GDP/capita gaps in the future. If we assume
13

that the GDP (either measured in constant 2000 USD and in PPP constant 2005
international $) and the population of each Southern and Northern sub group grow
at the same growth rates as they did on average through 1990‐2009, we can project
the GDP/capita of groups and individual countries out to 2030. Results are reported
in Table 2‐9. The picture is a rapid narrowing of all gaps, except the North‐Brazil gap.
The North‐China would narrow the most quickly and the North‐ Large Three gap the
second.

An alternative projection of the North‐South gap in GDP/capita out to 2030
assumes that all gaps continue to narrow at the same average speed as between
1990 and 2009. Results are reported in Table 2‐10.

The picture is similar to the projection above. All gaps except North‐Brazil gap
narrow quickly from 2010 to 2030, the North‐China gap narrows the most quickly.
Results show slightly differences from assuming unchanged GDP and population
growth through 1990 and 2009.
Our projections (in PPP constant 2005 international dollars) suggest that the
North‐South gap in 2030 will be similar to the Rich/Rest spread projections reported
by Maddison (2008) in 1990 international PPP dollars. Maddison (2008) projects that
between 2003 and 2030 Rich/Rest GDP per capita spread (in 1990 international
dollars) will narrow from 6.1:1 to 4.4:1, a 26% fall. Our projections suggest that
North‐South GDP per capita will narrow by 34% between 2009 and 2030. Also our
calculations suggest that North/China GDP/capita gap will narrow to 1.2 in 2030
while Maddison’s Rich/China spread will narrow to 2.3. Maddison’s calculations are
more conservative with respect to China because he assumes that China’s GDP per
capita growth will decelerate from 5.6% per year before 2010 to 4.6% from 2010 and
2020 and to 3.6% per year from 2020 and 2030. The deceleration reflects the
assumptions that China will have to reallocate resources from more productive
activities to decrease damage from environmental degradation, wages will rise and
that China’s technological level will approach that of advanced countries’. We project
that North/India GDP per capita gap will narrow to 5.5 in 2030. Our projections with
respect to India are almost the same as the projections in Maddison who projects a
Rich/India spread of 5.2 in 2030.

3. The Growing Share of China, India and Brazil in World Trade
In addition to the narrowing gap in terms of GDP/capita relative to the North,
China, India and Brazil also account for a growing fraction of world trade and with it a
growing share of Southern trade. Table 3‐1 reports data on North and South shares in
world trade between the 1960s and 2009. In the 1960s the China, India and Brazil
combined share in world trade was 3.3%. Today their share is 11.8%, a 3.5 fold
increase. Table 3‐1 also indicates that all other South subgroups have expanded their
shares in world trade in the last few decades but to a smaller degree than the Large
Three. The share of the South in world trade has also grown from 23.9% in the 1960s
to 35.6% in 2009. This has been accompanied by a decrease in the Northern share of
world trade from 76.1% to 64.4% over the same period. The Large Three as the
fastest growing group in world trade are followed by oil exporters whose shares
increased from 4.5% to 7.5%, a 1.6 fold increase. The Rest of South increased their
share only a little from 16.1% to 16.4%, a 1.02 fold increase.

Trade is the sum of merchandise imports and merchandise exports in current USD.

The faster growth of the Large Three and their expanding share in world
trade has also resulted in a change in position relative to Oil Exporters and the Rest of
South. In the 1960s the Large Three were behind Oil Exporters. In 2009 the share of
Large Three was 1.6 times larger than Oil Exporters and they moved closer to the
16

Rest of South whose share was little changed from the 1960s. In the 1960s the share
of the Large Three was 4.8 times smaller than the share of the Rest of South and in
2009 it was only 1.4 times smaller.
In the North the G7 countries in combination (US, Japan, Germany, Canada,
France, Italy and UK) decreased their share from 52.8% to 37.3%, a 29% fall between
the 1960s and 2009. The share of the Rest of North expanded from 23.3% to 27.1%.
Table 3‐2 presents data on annual shares in world trade since 1990. In 1990
the Southern share in world trade was 17.7% and this was the lowest point of the
Southern share over the period the 1960s‐2009. Conversely, in 1990, North share in
world trade reached a maximum of 82.3%. Between 1990 and 2009, South’s share
doubled from 17.7% to 35.6% and North share shrank by almost a quarter from
82.3% to 64.4%. In the North and South, the biggest changes in shares have occurred
in G7 and the Large Three, and especially in China.

Trade is the sum of merchandise imports and merchandise exports in current USD.

Table 3‐3 reports data on growth rates of North and South trade between
the 1960s and 2009. In the 1960s and 1980s the growth rates of Southern trade were
below the world average and the share of the South in world trade fell from 23.9% in
the 1960s to 21.2% in the 1990s. In 1990 the Southern share in world trade was as

17

low as 17.7%; the lowest point over the last five decades. Since 1990, however,
Southern trade has grown at rates significantly above both world and Northern trade
and this has lead to an expansion in the Southern share in world trade from 17.7% in
1990 to 35.6% in 2009. In the 1990s Southern trade grew 1.7 times faster than
Northern trade. In the 2000s Southern trade grew twice as fast as Northern trade;
the growth of Southern trade accelerated to 12.3% while Northern trade growth was
only 5.6%.

Trade is the sum of merchandise imports and merchandise exports in current USD.

Table 3‐3 also shows that since the 1980s trade growth rates for Large Three
have been significantly above both the world and Southern averages. In the 1980s
their trade grew at 7.4%, in the 1990s at 11.1% and in the 2000s at 17.5%. In contrast,
world average growth rates were 4.8%, 6% and 7.6% and Southern growth rates were
0.5%, 8.9% and 12.3%. The Large Three share in world trade increased from 3.2% in
1990 to 5.3% in 2000 and their share jumped to 11.8% in 2009. Within the Large
Three, China has the largest share in world trade which increased from 1.7% in 1990
to 3.7% in 2000 and to 8.9% in 2009, a 5 fold increase. In 2009 India’s share in world
trade was 5.2 times smaller than for China, even through it increased from 0.6% in
1990 to 1.7% in 2009. Brazil’s share increased only in recent years from 0.9% in 2005
18

to 1.2% in 2009.
Through their trade and GDP growth Brazil, China and India have evolved as
global powerhouses in terms of manufacturing activity and trade, while smaller
countries in the South have remained largely in traditional mode. Between 1965 and
2009 Large South trade in industrial products grew faster than total trade and its
share in total exports increased. China’s exports of manufactures as a share of total
exports increased from 26.4% in 1985 to 93.6% in 2009. Between 1965 and 2009
Brazil’s exports of manufactures increased from 7.7% to 39.5% of total exports and
India’s from 48.2% to 66.8% of total exports. This shift in the product composition of
trade towards industrial products is a reflection of both technological advance in the
Large South and also improved labor quality through investment in human capital
and education. Between 1965 and 2009, the share of primary products in total
exports fell for all three countries; the most dramatic change being for China, from
73.6% to 6.4%.1

Brazil, China and India as a group have played a major role in these changes
and we analyze their contribution through counterfactual analyses. Table 3‐6 reports
actual South shares in world trade and also what South shares in world trade would
have been under alternative assumptions. These are if Large Three trade had grown
at Southern growth rates, if Large Three trade had grown at world average rates, if
Large Three trade had grown at South growth rates excluding Large Three or if Large
Three trade had remained constant. If Brazil, India and China’s trade had grown at
world average rates, Southern shares in world trade would have been increased from
17.7% in 1990 to 29.6% in 2009, an 11.9 percentage point increase. Actual Southern
shares in world trade increased from 17.7% in 1990 to 35.6% in 2009. Large Three
trade grew faster than the world average and under this analysis the contribution of
the Large Three to this growth of Southern shares in world trade between 1990 and
2009 is 33.5%.
If Brazil, China and India’s trade had grown at Southern growth rates after
20

1990, Southern shares in world trade would have been increased from 17.7% in 1990
to 31.9% in 2009. Actual Southern shares increased from 17.7% to 35.6%. Under this
analysis, because the Large Three trade grew faster than Southern trade, the
contribution of the Large Three to the elevated Southern shares in world trade is
20.7%. The counterfactual Southern share in world trade under the hypothesis that
Large Three trade had remained constant is 27.7% in 2009. Under this analysis, the
contribution of the Large Three to the growth of the Southern share is 44.1%.

Trade is the sum of merchandise imports and merchandise exports in current USD.

The share of the South in world trade if Brazil or India’s trade had grown at
world average rates and if their trade remains constant are close to the actual shares
of Southern trade. Thus their contribution seems small. However, if China’s trade had
grown at world average rates the South’s shares of world trade would have been
increased by 12.9 percentage points while the growth of the actual Southern shares
22

is 17.9 percentage points. Because China’s trade grew at rates significantly higher
than world average China’s contribution to the increase of Southern share between
1990 and 2009 is 27.9%. If China’s trade had remained constant over the period
1990‐2009, the Southern share in world trade would be 29.7% in 2009 while the
actual share is 5.9 percentage points higher. Under this hypothesis, the contribution
of China is 32.9%.

4. The Narrowing North‐South Gap in Stock Market Capitalization
In addition to the North‐South gap in GDP/capita and the growing share of
the South in world trade, there has been an even more rapid narrowing of the gap in
North‐South stock market capitalization to which we now turn briefly. This reflects
not only more rapid GDP growth in China, India and Brazil, but also the maturation of
financial structure in these countries, and the impacts of expected high future growth
on market capitalization.
Changes in the North‐South stock market capitalization shares are shown in
Table 4‐1. The South share in capitalization increased from 5.1% in the 1990s to
23.5% in 2009. The shares of the North and G7 dropped over time, with that of the
G7 dropping more than the North. The share of the Large Three increased from 3.6%
to 15.1% over 2002 to 2009, with China increasing the most from 2.0 to 7.3 and India
increasing the fastest from 1.1% to 5.2% over the same period.

Note: Here we use as domestic market capitalization the total number of issued shares of domestic
companies, including their several classes, multiplied by their respective prices at year-end.

In evaluating the contribution of the Large Three to the narrowing of the
North‐South gap in capitalization, we note there is a lack of data on stock market
capitalization for China and India before the 2002 World Federation of Exchanges
database was assembled and their contribution enters only in the most recent years.
China established two stock exchanges (Shanghai SE and Shenzhen SE) in the late
24

1990 but had only 13 listed companies at the beginning. China’s stock market
experienced violent ups and downs and initially failed to provide a significant
financing source. But with the enforcement of Securities Laws in 1999, Accounting
Laws in 2000 and other regulations, China’s stock market developed rapidly. Its
capitalization has increased from 0.268 BN Yuan to 820.74 BN Yuan (over $100 Billion)
between 1990 and 2009.1
Table 4‐2 reports the growth rates of Northern and Southern country groups
in stock market capitalization. The growth rates of both groups shows sharp rises and
falls before 2003. China experienced negative growth in 2004 and 2005, but other
groups /countries all experienced positive growth between 2003 and 2007. The
difference lays in the feature that growth in capitalization of the North, G7, oil
exporters and Rest of South decelerated while others accelerated over this period. The
capitalization of all groups (countries) dropped sharply in 2008 and rebounded strongly in
2009. The capitalization of China grew the most rapidly in 2006 and 2007 while Brazil
rebounded the most quickly in 2009.

counterfactuals the North‐South capitalization gap would decrease over time, though
the counterfactual gap remains larger than the actual gap. Since the Large Three
contributed over half of Southern capitalization in recent years, the North‐South gap
would have widened from 3.3 to 7.7 in 2009 if the Large Three had zero growth in
capitalization after 2002. If the capitalization of the Large Three grew at the same
rate as the world after 2002, the North‐South gap in 2009 would be 21.2 instead of
3.3. Without growth in the Large Three, the North‐Large Three gap would widen to
45.5 in 2009 instead of 5.1.

We next analyze the counterfactual North‐South gap under a hypothesis
that capitalization of individual countries (China, India, and Brazil) grows at the same
rate as the world (or zero) after 2002. Results are reported in Table 4‐4. North‐South
or North‐Large Three gaps in capitalization narrow over time if China, India or Brazil
grow individually as the world or zero after 2002. However, counterfactual gaps are

26

wider than actual gaps. Among the three countries, China contributes the most and
Brazil contributes the least in narrowing the North‐South gap, as well as to the
North‐Large Three gap in capitalization. If there is no growth of China after 2002, the
North‐South gap in 2009 would be 4.5 instead of 3.3 and the North‐Large Three gap
would be 8.7 instead of 5.1.

Global FDI inflows also contribute to market capitalization through local
subsidiaries and proportions of global FDI inflows for country groups are reported in
Table 4‐5 as these. Though the North still dominates FDI inflows, shares of the South
in world total FDI inflows have also increased steadily over time and accounted for
over 40% after 2008. The Large Three have doubled their share of world FDI inflows
27

over past 50 years, while the G7 has lost about a third of its share over the same
period. Among the Southern groups, the Large Three had one fifth of total Southern
FDI inflows in the 1970s and around one third in 2009.

The South has also increased its own outward investment flows from around
of 10% of world FDI outwards in 1970s to about 20% in 2009. Among the South, the
Large Three have seen a rapid increase in outward investment. The outward
investment of China and India increased 57 times and 2482 times respectively
between 1990 and 2009 (India’s outward investments grew from a small base and
reached only one‐third of China’s investment in 2009).

5. Conclusion
The world economy is changing quickly with a notable narrowing of the
North‐South gap in GDP/capita, international trade and market capitalization. Our
paper highlights how important China, India and Brazil are for these changes. In the
Chinese case this also coincides with a growing relocation of global manufacturing
industry to China.
The calculations we report suggest that China and India had GDP/capita
below the average of the South before 2000 but their GDP/capita rose quickly. From
the 1960s on, China’s GDP/capita increased from the lowest among the Large Three
and overtook India’s. Over the last two decades, the North‐South gap in GDP/capita
measured in constant USD at market exchange rate has fallen from 22.1 to 15.9 and
North‐Large Three gap fallen from 39.3 to 16.6. At the same time North‐China and
North‐India gaps in GDP/capita have fallen from 57.2 to 13.1 and from 70.4 to 38.1
respectively. If measured in PPP terms, North‐South gap in GDP/capita narrowed
from 8.9 in 1990 to 6.5 in 2009, which is close but bigger than estimates made by
Maddison (2008). Without the growth of Large Three or China individually, the
North‐South gap in GDP/capita would enlarge from 15.9 to 23.9 or 20.9 respectively
in 2009.
Trade shares of the South are also growing rapidly and Brazil, China and
India are a big part of the change. Between 1990 and 2009 the Southern share in
world trade rose from 17.7% to 35.6% with the share of the Large Three increasing
from 3.2% to 11.8%. Without the growth of the Large Three, the Southern share
would only account for 27.7% of world trade instead of 35.6% in 2009. Thus, the
contribution of the Large Three to the increase of Southern share is 44.1%. Without
the growth of China’s trade, the Southern share would account for 29.7% of world
trade. The contribution of China to the elevated South shares in world trade is 32.9%.
We suggest the North‐South gap has narrowed the most rapidly in stock
market capitalization. The South share of world market capitalization rose from 5.9%
to 23.5% and the share of the Large Three has risen from 0.1% to 15.1% over 1990 to
2009. Brazil, China and India together contributed around three fourths of the
29

growing Southern share of world market capitalization. Without their growth,
North‐South gap in capitalization would widen from 3.3 to 7.7 in 2009. Among the
Large Three, China contributed the most to the narrowing in the North‐South gap.
Without China’s growth, North‐South gap in capitalization would widen from 3.3 to
4.5 in 2009.
The already rapidly changing world also seems poised to change ever further.
Simple projections under an assumption that growth continues at current rates
suggests that North‐South gaps would narrow further sharply and the North‐South
gap in GDP/capita could fall from 15.9 in 2009 to 10 by 2030 measured in constant
price and 4 in PPP terms, and the South would be dominant in both world trade and
stock market capitalization. North‐China gaps are projected to fall from 13.1 in 2009
to 2.7 in 2030 at market exchange rates and from 5.5 in 2009 to 1.2 in 2030 at PPP
rates.
