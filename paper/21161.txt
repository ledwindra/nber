The Supply and Demand of S&P 500 Put Options

ABSTRACT
We document that the implied volatility skew of S&P 500 index puts is non-decreasing in the disaster
index and risk-neutral variance, contrary to the implications of a broad class of no-arbitrage models.
The key to the puzzle lies in recognizing that, as the disaster risk increases, customers demand more
puts as insurance while market makers become more credit-constrained in writing puts. The resulting
increase in the equilibrium price is more pronounced in out-of-the-money than in-the-money puts,
thereby steepening the implied volatility skew and resolving the puzzle. Consistent with the data, the
model also implies that the equilibrium net buy of puts is decreasing in the disaster index, variance,
and their price. The data shows a significant decreasing relationship between the IV skew and the net
buy and no relationship in other periods, also explained by the model.

Introduction

We document that the implied volatility skew of S&P 500 index puts, defined as the implied
volatility (IV) of out-of-the money (OTM) puts minus the implied volatility of at-the-money
(ATM) puts is non-decreasing in the disaster index and risk-neutral (RN) variance. We dub
this the “skew response puzzle” because, as we demonstrate, a broad class of widely used
no-arbitrage models for pricing options that allow for stochastic volatility and price jumps
implies that the skew is a decreasing function of the disaster index and RN variance.
We address the skew response puzzle by departing from the class of no-arbitrage models
of pricing options and endogenizing the supply and demand of index puts. The key departure lies in recognizing that the principal writers of index puts are market makers who
face credit constraints which are modeled here as an exogenously imposed Value-at-Risk
(VaR) constraint. The model captures the scenario where risk neutral market makers write
“overpriced” index puts to maximize their expected profit, subject to their credit constraint,
while risk averse customers buy the index to maximize their expected utility and hedge their
exposure to downside risk by buying index puts. The key to the puzzle lies in recognizing
that, as the disaster risk and variance increase, customers demand more puts as insurance
while market makers become more credit-constrained in writing puts. The resulting increase
in the equilibrium price is more pronounced in out-of-the-money than in at-the-money puts,
thereby steepening the IV skew and resolving the puzzle.
We define the “net buy” by public customers of index options of given moneyness and
maturity in a month as the average of the daily executed total buy orders by public customers
and firms (to open new positions or close existing ones) during the month minus their
daily executed total sell orders. The net buy is the equilibrium quantity determined at the
intersection of the supply and demand curves, unlike some earlier literature that treats the

2

net buy as a proxy for demand. The shift in the supply and demand for S&P 500 put options
not only explains the IV skew puzzle but also explains a novel set of empirical observations
about the net buy of puts which challenge earlier models. In particular, these observations
suggest that the demand pressure hypothesis alone is deficient in explaining the net buy
of puts. The supply shift by credit-constrained market makers plays an important role in
explaining the net buy of puts. Our model provides implications regarding the net buy that
are born out in the data.
The model and the data consistently imply that the net buy of puts by public customers
is decreasing in the RN variance and disaster index. The intuition is that, when the RN
variance and/or disaster index increase, public customers like to buy more puts as insurance
but market makers become more credit-constrained. That is, both the supply and demand
curves shift. The supply shift turns out to be the driving factor in the decrease in the
equilibrium net buy of puts.
We also address the model implications regarding the relationship between the net buy
of puts and their price. The model implies that the net buy of OTM and ATM puts is
decreasing in their price. The intuition is the same as above. When the RN variance and/or
disaster index increase, public customers like to buy more puts as insurance but market
makers become more credit-constrained. The supply shift turns out to be the driving factor
in the decrease in the equilibrium net buy and the price increase of OTM puts. These
implications are born out in the data.
Our model implications regarding the relationship between the net buy and the IV skew of
puts are also consistent with the data. The data shows no significant relationship in general
except a decreasing relationship during the financial crisis. The model implies that the net
buy of OTM puts increases with the IV skew when the RN variance is fixed and we vary the
disaster risk. The net buy of OTM puts decreases the skew with when we fix the disaster
3

risk and vary the RN variance. For ATM puts, our model implies that the net buy decreases
the skew when we vary the disaster risk and fix the RN variance, but may either increase
or decrease with the skew when we fix the disaster risk and vary the RN variance. Given
the correlation between the RN variance and disaster index, the relationship between the IV
skew and the net buy of OTM and ATM puts is complex.
Finally, we confirm the robustness of our results by constructing the net buy of OTM and
ATM options by using different ranges of moneyness and maturity; by de-trending the net
buy in different ways; and by studying the relation of the net buy with the RN variance,
disaster index, option prices, and IV skew for different sub-periods, before, during, and after
the financial crisis.
Our paper relates to the extensive literature on dealers’ and intermediaries’ credit constraints and funding liquidity in the form of VaR, margin, and leverage constraints. Representative examples include Adrian and Shin (2014), Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009),
Danielsson, Shin, and Zigrand (2004), Gromb and Vayanos (2002), He and Krishnamurthy
(2013), Shleifer and Vishny (1997), and Thurner, Farmer, and Gaenakoplos (2012). In
particular, Adrian and Shin (2014) provided evidence that the VaR constraint of financial
intermediaries, normalized by equity, is constant over the financial cycle.
Specific to the pricing of options, this literature examines the extent to which traders’
and intermediaries’ credit constraints and funding liquidity may explain difficulties with noarbitrage models of option pricing. In a prescient essay, Bates (2003) stated: “Relatively
few option market makers apparently have been writing crash insurance for a broad array of
money managers, which may pose institutional difficulties for the risk-sharing assumptions
underlying representative agent models. On the demand side, it is conceivable that especially
risk-averse money managers have been willing to buy crash insurance that never seems to
pay off.” Bollen and Whaley (2004) examined the relation between the net buying pressure
4

of index options and found that the IV of index options is directly related to the buying
pressure for index puts.
Gârleanu, Pedersen, and Poteshman (2009) introduced exogenous shifts in the demand
by public customers for index options. An exogenous positive shift in the demand for a
certain option increases its price because risk-averse market-makers are unable to perfectly
hedge their inventories and their supply of options is less than perfectly elastic. In Section
6, we present empirical evidence that the net buy of both OTM and ATM S&P 500 puts
is decreasing in the respective put price, suggesting that the demand pressure hypothesis
alone does not explain the data. Whereas the Gârleanu et al. (2009) model does not address
the skew response puzzle, their Proposition 4 states that an exogenous positive shift in the
demand for a certain OTM put has a bigger pricing effect on the demand of deep OTM
puts than on slightly OTM puts, that is, the IV skew unambiguously becomes steeper with
higher net buy. In Section 6, we present empirical evidence that the IV skew is never
increasing in the net buy of puts and is actually decreasing during the financial crisis. These
considerations motivate the introduction of supply shifts, in addition to demand shifts, in
the options market.
Chen, Joslin, and Ni (2014) modeled the market makers’ risk aversion and credit constraints as an increasing function of the disaster risk. Their model implies that the demand
for crash insurance, proxied by the net buy of deep OTM puts, predicts the return on the
S&P 500 index. Our model significantly differs from that of Chen et al. (2014). First, our
model specifically addresses the supply and demand shifts of put options across moneyness
and addresses a comprehensive set of stylized facts regarding the implied volatility skew
and the net buy of puts. Second, we model the market makers’ credit constraint as a VaR
constraint that is driven by both the disaster risk and variance, unlike the credit constraint
in the Chen et al. (2014) model that is driven by disaster risk alone.

Our paper also relates to the extensive literature on stochastic dominance violations by
option prices. Constantinides, Czerwonko, Jackwerth, and Perrakis (2011) and Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Perrakis (2009) showed that OTM European calls on the S&P 500
index and OTM American calls on the S&P 500 index futures frequently imply stochastic
dominance violations: any risk averse investor who invests in a portfolio of the index and the
risk free asset increases his expected utility by writing OTM “overpriced” calls. By contrast,
these papers found that OTM puts on the S&P 500 index and the index futures rarely imply
stochastic dominance violations: a risk averse investor who invests in a portfolio of the index
and the risk free asset rarely increases his expected utility by writing OTM “overpriced”
puts. These findings motivate our focus on OTM puts, as opposed to OTM calls. In our paper, we model investors as buyers, as opposed to sellers, of OTM puts to hedge the downside
risk of their investment in the market portfolio. This modelling choice is consistent with the
above findings on stochastic dominance.
Our paper also relates to the extensively literature on no-arbitrage option pricing models. Examples include Andresen, Benzoni, and Lund (2002), Andersen, Fusari, and Todorov
(2015a,b), Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997), Bates (2000, 2006), Broadie, Chernov, and Johannes (2007), Chernov, Gallant, Ghysels, and Tauchen (2003), Duffie, Pan, and Singleton
(2000), Eraker (2004), Eraker, Johannes, and Polson (2003), Heston (1993), Heston, Christoffersen, and Jacobs (2009), Lian (2014), and Pan (2002).
Finally, our paper relates to the literature that addresses the cross-sectional variation
in index option returns. Examples include Buraschi and Jackwerth (2001), Cao and Huang
(2008), Carverhill, Dyrting, and Cheuk (2009), Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Savov (2013),
and Jones (2006). Specifically, Constantinides et al. (2013) demonstrated that any one of
crisis-related factors incorporating price jumps, volatility jumps, and liquidity, along with
the market, explains the cross-sectional variation in index option returns. These findings

6

motivate our focus on disaster risk and liquidity constrains in the form of VaR constraints.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the variables and describe the
data. In Section 3, we present the skew response puzzle. The model is stated in Section
4. In Section 5, we demonstrate that the model explains the IV skew puzzle. In Section
6, we discuss the model implications on the net buy by public customers and relate them
to the empirical evidence. In Section 7, we discuss extensions of the model and conclude.
Derivations are relegated to the appendix.

Definition of the Variables and Description of the
Data

2.1

Definition of the Variables

The Implied volatility (IV) is the Black-Scholes implied volatility. Moneyness is defined as
the ratio of the strike price to the index price, K/S. We compute the model-implied skew
as the difference between the IV of a one-month put with moneyness 0.85 and the IV of a
one-month ATM put. We compute the empirical skew from all ATM S&P 500 put options
with moneyness 0.97-1.03 and maturity 15-60 days; and OTM puts with moneyness 0.8-0.9
and maturity 15-60 days. Each day, we first compute the average IV of ATM and OTM puts.
We then calculate the skew as the difference between the average IV of the OTM and ATM
put options. Finally, we average these slopes across all trading days of the given calendar
month.
The Risk Neutral (RN) Variance, also known as the squared VIX, is defined as in Britten-

where S0 is the index price at the beginning of the month; K is the strike; T is one month;
C(S0 ; K, T ) is the European call price; P (S0 ; K, T ) is the European put price; and is the
continuously-compounded risk free rate.

Du and Kapadia (2012) showed that this is a variance measure that is more inclusive of

We compute the RN variance and disaster index from available option prices. First, we
extract the B-S implied volatility from the B-S implied volatility surface at the two available
maturities closest to 30 calendar days. Cubic splines are first applied in the moneyness
dimension, defined as strike price divided by stock price and ranging from 0.003 to 3, to
interpolate the B-S implied volatility for each moneyness of a fixed maturity. Therefore, the
interpolated implied volatility as a smooth function of moneyness is obtained for each of
8

the two option maturities. Next, for each moneyness in the previous step, we apply linear
interpolation using the B-S implied volatility of the two maturities to achieve the B-S implied
volatility at 30 days of maturity.
We define the model-implied net buy of puts as the model-implied number of puts purchased by the customer at the beginning of the period. We construct our empirical measure
of the monthly net buy of S&P 500 put options by customers as follows. The daily net buy
of a given option on a given trading day is the sum of the open buy and close buy minus the
sum of open sell and close sell on that day by customers. We calculate the monthly net buy
of options for two moneyness ranges, OTM (0.8-0.9) and ATM (0.97-1.03, and maturity 1560 days. We next compute the monthly net buy for a given target moneyness and maturity
as the average of the daily net buy across all trading days of the given calendar month of all
options with the targeted moneyness and maturity range. Our measure of the monthly net
buy is the de-trended net buy that is computed as the realized net buy of a certain category
of options, such as OTM puts, dividend by the total trading volume of put options in this
maturity category.
We also de-trended the net buy by using the total trading volume of all puts in the same
moneyness and maturity, or total call or puts at the same maturity or same moneyness
category, and obtained similar results, not reported in the paper. We also considered an
alternative definition of net buy that includes the net buy by proprietary firms, in addition
to the net buy by customers. The results remained virtually unchanged because the net buy
by firms is a small fraction of the total net buy and are not reported in the paper.

2.2

Description of the Data

The data for computing the net option buy is obtained from the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) from the beginning of 1996 to the end of 2012. The data consists of a
daily record of traded contract volumes on open-buy, open-sell, close-buy, and close-sell for
each option by three types of public customers plus proprietary firms. The public customers
include small, medium, and large customers. We compute the net buy of each of these
groups of agents as the long interest minus the short interest of both open and close to
trade. According to the order size, an order size greater than 200 contracts is classified as
orders of a large customer, the order size between 101-200 contracts is classified as orders
of a median customer, and the order size less than 100 contracts is classified as the order of
a small customer. Small customers on S&P 500 options are not necessarily retail traders.
Instead, Chen, Goslin, and Ni (2014) showed that the small customers who sold deep OTM
S&P 500 puts are institutional traders. Our measure of net buy is the sum of the net buy
by the three categories of customers.
Option prices are obtained from a high-frequency dataset provided by the Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE). It contains intra-day trades and quotes of the S&P 500 options.
The minute-level data of the index values of the S&P 500 index is from Tick Data Inc. The
recorded underlying S&P 500 index values for each option are the corresponding index levels
at the moment when the option bid-ask quote is recorded. The dividend yield of S&P 500
index is provided by OptionMetrics. For a given option, we extract the implied interest rate
from the put-call parity as in Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Savov (2013).

The Skew Response Puzzle

A broad class of widely used no-arbitrage models extends the original Black and Scholes
(1973) and Merton (1973) model of pricing options by allowing for stochastic volatility and
jumps in the price and volatility. The Bates (2006) model, a representative model in this
class, is specified as follows in terms of the RN probability measure:
p
Vt
− (λ0 + λ1 Vt )µ)dt + (Vt )dW1t + Jt dNt
2
p
= k(θ − Vt )dt + σ Vt dW2t

dlog(St ) = (rt − qt −
dVt

(4)
(5)

where dlog(St ) is the instantaneous stock market log return; rt is the risk free rate; qt is the
dividend yield; Vt is the instantaneous variance conditional upon no jumps; dW1t and dW2t
are Wiener processes with correlation ρ ; Nt is a Poisson counter with intensity λ0 + λ1 Vt
for the incidence of jumps; and Jt ∼ N (µ, σJ2 ) is a random Gaussian jump. The empirical
correlation between the disaster risk and the RN variance is around 0.96, which indicates
that a linear relationship between the disaster probability and RN variance is reasonable.
We estimate the model with daily S&P 500 call and put prices over the period 1996:Q12012:Q4. The moneyness ranges from 0.85 to 1.15 and the maturity ranges from 15 to 360
days. We proxy the latent state variable Vt with the RN variance estimated from the crosssection of S&P 500 options maturing in 30 days.1 We estimate the model by minimizing the
sum of squared errors of all options, where the error of one option is defined as the observed
IV minus the model-implied IV. The parameter estimates are σ = 0.27, λ0 = 2.89E − 9,
λ1 = 4.24, µ = −6.25, σJ = 14.99, κ = 0.038, θ = 0.95, ρ = −0.79. Since λ1 > 0, the model
1

We justify ex post the procedure of proxying the latent state variable Vt with the squared RN implied
volatility as follows. We use the point estimates of the parameters to calculate the model-implied option prices
at different values√of the state variable Vt , calculate the RN implied volatility, and regress the RN implied
volatility against Vt . The regression coefficient is 0.857 and the intercept√is 0.00677, thereby justifying the
commonly-used estimation procedure of proxying the latent state variable Vt with the squared RN implied
volatility.

11

has the plausible implication that the probability of disaster is increasing in the variance.
The parameter estimates are reported using a daily time interval and scaling the stock return
by 100, as is conventional in the time-series literature, such as Broadie et al. (2007), Eraker
(2002), and Lian (2014).
In figure 1, we display the IV skew as a function of the disaster index and the RN variance,
implied by the Bates (2006) model. The skew is decreasing in the RN variance. The flattening
skew is a common feature of this class of models. The intuition is that the distinction between
the IV of OTM puts and the ATM puts diminishes and the skew flattens as the RN variance
increases. The skew is decreasing also in the disaster index. If the RN variance were kept
constant, the IV skew would be increasing in the disaster risk. The reason that the IV skew
is decreasing in the disaster index is that in the Bates (2006) model the RN variance and
the disaster risk are perfectly positively correlated. The decreasing pattern indicates that
the disaster risk impacts the IV skew less than the RN variance does in the no-arbitrage
model. It would be unrealistic to construct a no-arbitrage model where the RN variance and
disaster risk are either uncorrelated or negatively correlated because, as figure 2 illustrates,
the RN variance and the disaster risk are strongly positively correlated in the data.
We also estimate the Bates (2006) model for the sub-periods before, during, and after
the 2008 crisis, and obtain the same pattern for the IV skew. We note that the regularities
displayed in figure 1 are invariant to assumptions about the price of volatility risk and
disaster risk because the Bates (2006) model is stated here in terms of only the risk neutral
probability measure without reference to the physical measure.

[Figures 1 and 2 here]

We verified similar results in other no-arbitrage models. The model in Andersen et al.
(2015a) is more flexible with a multifactor volatility process and jumps in price and volatility
12

processes. They modeled the jump intensity as being linear in the volatility as in Bates
(2006). Their model has similar implications: the IV skew is decreasing in both the disaster
index and the RN variance. Naturally, it remains an open question whether a plausible
no-arbitrage model exists that displays a non-decreasing IV skew as a function of either the
disaster index or the RN variance and also captures the strong positive correlation between
the disaster index and the RN variance.
The puzzle is that the implications of the no-arbitrage model in figure 1 are inconsistent
with the empirical evidence. In figure 3 , we display the empirical IV skew of S&P 500
options as a function of the RN variance and disaster index over the time period January
1996-Decamber 2012; before the financial crisis, January 1996-November 2007; during the
crisis, December 2007-June 2009; and after the crisis, July 2009-December 2012. The figure
shows that the IV skew is non-decreasing in the disaster index and RN variance. (See also the
regression results in Table 1, discussed later on.) This observation motivates us to propose
a model for the pricing of puts that incorporates credit constraints faced by market makers.
[Figure 3 here]
In the following sections, we address the skew response puzzle and the observed behavior
of the net buy by departing from the class of no-arbitrage models of pricing options and
endogenizing their supply and demand. The key departure lies in recognizing that the
principal writers of index puts are market makers who face credit constraints, modeled here
as an exogenously imposed Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint. In figure 4, we present the time
series of two measures of financial constraints, noise and the TED spread. The TED spread
is the difference between the 3-month LIBOR and the 3-month T-bill rate. The noise is a
fixed-income market based funding liquidity measure by Hu, Pan, and Wang (2013). The
financial constraints vary over time and peak during the financial crisis. After successfully
addressing the skew response puzzle, we also show that our model implications about the
13

relationship between the net buy of puts and the disaster index, RN variance, put price, and
IV skew are consistent with the data.

A Model of the Supply and Demand for Index Put
Options

We consider a one-period model. Agents trade at the beginning of the period and consume
at the end of the period. There are three traded assets: risk free bonds, the market index
(stock), and one-period puts of given moneyness. Bonds are elastically supplied. Each bond
pays one unit of the consumption good at the end of the period. The bond price is the
numeraire at the beginning of the period. Therefore, without loss of generality, the risk free
rate is zero.
Shares of stock are elastically supplied. A share of stock pays S units of the consumption
good at the end of the period. A disaster occurs with probability p, 0 < p < 1. In the
no-disaster state, S = eµ+σZ and in the disaster state, S = eµJ +σJ Z , where Z ∼ N (0, 1) and
µ, µJ , σ, σJ are parameters. The stock price at the beginning of the period is exogenous
and equals one. We assume that the expected equity premium is positive, (1 − p)eµ+σZ +
peµJ +σJ Z > 1.
The parameters p, µ, µJ , σ and σJ are specific to a given month. We allow the RN variance
and disaster index to differ across months. Therefore, different months are associated with
different parameter values. We make no assumptions about the time-series process of these
parameters but estimate the disaster index and RN variance from the cross-section of puts
prices each month.
14

The model-implied variance of log(S) on the real probability measure is


var {log(S)} = E (1 − p){p(µ − µJ ) + σZ}2 + p{−p(µ − µJ ) + σJ Z}2
= (1 − p)p(µ − µJ )2 + (1 − p)σ 2 + pσJ2

(6)

Since the model-implied variance reduces to σ 2 , if we suppress disasters (p = 0), we define
the model-implied disaster index on the real probability measure as




(1 − p)p(µ − µJ )2 + (1 − p)σ 2 + pσJ2 − σ 2

= (1 − p)p(µ − µJ )2 + p(σJ2 − σ 2 )

(7)

In Section 5, we calibrate the model and establish that the model-implied disaster index
and RN variance are very highly correlated with the expressions in equations (6) and (7),
respectively.
A put option has strike K and pays [K − S]+ units of the consumption good at the end
of the period. Puts are in zero net supply. The put price at the beginning of the period is
P . The put price must be lower than the strike price, P ≤ K; otherwise a bond that pays
K dominates the put.
There are two classes of price-taking agents, the “customer” and the “market maker”.
The customer has initial endowment W0 . He buys α shares of stock and β puts, and invests
W0 − α − βP units of the numeraire in bonds. He maximizes his expected quadratic utility:
max E[U ]
α,β

where
U ≡ W0 − α − βP + αS + β[K − S]+ −

2
A!
W0 − α − βP + αS + β[K − S]+
2

and A is a preference parameter. We specify the utility as quadratic merely for computational convenience. The customer’s marginal utility is positive, provided W0 − α − βP +
αS + β[K − S]+ < A−1 . In our calibration, we set W0 ≪ A−1 and this guarantees that
the marginal utility is positive. The relative risk aversion coefficient is E[−(W0 − α − βP +
′′

′′

αS + β[K − S]+ )U /U ′ ] ≈ −W0 U /U ′ . The objective function is concave in α and β. The
first-order conditions are affine functions of α and β and their optimal values are calculated
in the appendix in closed form.
The market maker (MM) has zero endowment (without loss of generality), buys shares of
stock and puts, and maximizes his expected payoff:

In equilibrium, the market maker writes puts. The constraint α̂ ≤ 0 captures the institutional role of a market maker that he may choose to hedge his position by selling stock short
but does not speculate by buying stock. We model the market maker as risk neutral merely
for convenience. What is important is that the market maker is less risk averse than the
customer. In practice, market makers may or may not hedge their short positions in puts
but this does not change the nature of our problem because the providers of the hedging

instruments to the market makers also face credit constraints.
The equilibrium put price is such that the put market clears, β + β̂ = 0. If the put price
is lower than the expected payoff of a put, P < E [[K − S]+ ], the MM does not write puts
and the supply of puts is zero. We calibrate the model in a way that the put price equals or
exceeds the expected payoff of a put, P ≥ E [[K − S]+ ]. This captures the situation where
the risk averse customer buys “overpriced” puts to hedge his investment in stock and the
risk neutral MM writes these puts to maximize profit.

Resolution of the Skew Response Puzzle

We calibrate the model as follows. We set the length of the time period as one month. We set
the range of p as 0.04 - 0.16, corresponding to 0.48 - 1.92 expected disasters per year. This
range of p is in line with the estimates in Pan (2002), Eraker (2004), Eraker, Johannes, and
Polson (2006), and Lian (2014). We set the range of σ as 0.02 to 0.14, which corresponds to
the annual volatility ranging from 0.07 to 0.48. We set µ = 0.005, corresponding to an annual
√
equity premium with mean 6% in the no-disaster state; µJ = −0.04 and σJ = 0.80/ 12,
corresponding to annual volatility 80% of the equity premium in the disaster state. For
this range of parameters, the annual equity risk premium ranges from 2.86% to 17.04%
and the annual volatility ranges from 7.38% to 45.01%, consistent with the observed equity
premium and volatility of the S&P 500 index. We set the customer’s initial wealth at
W0 = 500 and preference parameter at A = 0.001. The customer’s marginal utility is positive
since 500 ≪ 0.001−1 . The customer’s relative risk aversion coefficient is approximately
′′

−W0 U /U ′ = 500 × 0.001/(1 − 500 × 0.001) = 1, well within the range of the commonly
assumed level of risk aversion. Finally, we set the market maker’s initial wealth at zero, the
VaR threshold at W ∗ = −20, and the VaR probability at 1%.
17

In figure 5 , we display the supply and demand curves for ATM and OTM puts for and
monthly disaster probability 0.05 or 0.10. As the put price increases, the customer demands
fewer puts and the market maker offers to write more puts although the supply is quite
inelastic. When the volatility is 0.04 and the probability of disaster is 0.05, the net buy of
ATM puts is 101.44 and the net buy of OTM puts is 309.71; and when the volatility is 0.04
and the probability of disaster is 0.10, the net buy of ATM puts is 74.36 and the net buy of
OTM puts is 144.37.

[Figure 5 here]

We use a grid of parameter values p = 0.04, 0.045, ..., 0.16 and σ = 0.02, , 0.025, ..., 0.14.
For each parameter pair, we compute the cross-section of put prices with moneyness (K/S)
ranging from 0.8 to 1.15. From each cross-section of put prices, we compute the disaster
index, RN variance, and the IV skew. The RN variance has correlation 0.9998 with the
model-implied variance in equation (6); and the disaster index has correlation 0.8841 with
the model-implied disaster index in equation (7).
In figure 6 , we present the IV skew as a function of the disaster index and the RN variance.
In the first row, we fix as 0.04 or 0.08 and show that IV skew is increasing the disaster index.
In the second row, we fix as 0.06 or 0.10 and show the IV skew is decreasing in the RN
variance.

[Figure 6 here]

In Table 1, we report regressions of the observed IV skew on the observed disaster index
and RN variance. We compute the standard errors as in Newey and West (1987) with 15 lags
to correct for the autocorrelation of the IV skew. In univariate regressions, the coefficient of
the disaster index is positive and most significant during the crisis period. The coefficient of
18

the RN variance is insignificant over the full period and subperiods, except during the crisis
when it is positive and significant. We also report bi-variate regressions with both the RN
variance and disaster index as independent variables. For the whole period and subperiods,
the IV skew is increasing in the disaster index and RN variance but the coefficients are
statistically significant only in the whole period and after the crisis. Overall, the results are
ambiguous because of the high correlation between the disaster index and the RN variance.

[Table 1 here]

As an alternative way to decompose the impact of the disaster index and RN variance on
the IV skew, we classify all the months over the time period January 1996-December 2012
into ten bins with equal number of months in each bin, based on increasing RN variance. For
each bin, we plot the IV skew as a function of disaster index and find a positive relationship,
consistent with the model. In the first row of figure 7, we show these graphs for the second
percentile of the RN variance (low volatility risk) and the ninth percentile of the RN volatility
(high volatility risk). Consistent with the model, the IV skew is increasing in the disaster
index.
Next, we classify all months over the time period January 1996-December 2012 into ten
bins with equal number of months in each bin, based on increasing disaster index. For each
bin, we plot the IV skew as a function of the RN variance and find a negative relationship,
consistent with the model. In the second row of figure 7, we show these graphs for the second
percentile of disaster index (low disaster risk) and the ninth percentile of disaster index (high
disaster risk). Consistent with the model, the IV skew is decreasing in the RN variance.

Model Implications on the Net Buy of Puts and Empirical Evidence

In this section, we present several testable implications of the model regarding the net buy
of puts. We find that the model implications regarding the relation between the net buy of
puts and the disaster index, RN variance, put price, and the IV skew are consistent with the
empirical evidence. In none of the regressions presented in this section do we use variance,
disaster risk, or index returns as control variables because the net buy of puts in our model
is endogenous with these variables so that these variables cannot serve as control variables.

6.1

The Net Buy of Puts versus the Disaster Index and RN variance

We distinguish between a change in the net buy of OTM puts due to an increase in the
disaster index and a change in the net buy of OTM puts due to an increase in the RN
variance. First, we fix σ and vary p. For each value of p, we generate the cross-section of
OTM put prices and calculate the disaster index. In the top row of figure 8 , we present
the net buy of OTM puts as a function of the disaster index. The net buy is decreasing
in the disaster index. Second, we fix p and vary σ. For each value of σ, we generate the
cross-section of OTM put prices and calculate the RN variance. In the bottom row of figure
8 , we show that the net buy is decreasing in the RN variance. Thus the model predicts that
the net buy is decreasing in both the disaster index and the RN variance. These results are
consistent with our intuition. When the disaster index and/or the RN variance increase, the
customers like to buy more puts as insurance but the market makers become more creditconstrained. That is, both the supply and demand curves shift. The supply shift turns out

20

to be the driving factor in the decrease in the equilibrium net buy of puts.

[Figure 8 here]

Corresponding results for ATM puts are presented in figure 9. The model implies that
the net buy of ATM puts by customers is everywhere decreasing in the disaster index (top
row of figure 9). The model also implies that the net buy of ATM puts is increasing in the
RN variance when the variance level is low and decreasing in the variance when the variance
level is high (bottom row of figure 9).

[Figure 9 here]

In figure 10, we present the time series of the net buy by customers, the RN variance, and
the disaster index. Through most of the period January 1996 to December 2012, the net
buy of OTM puts is mostly positive, with a slight negative net buy when the RN variance
and disaster risk are relatively high, such as around 1999 (dot-com bubble) and after the
2008 financial crisis. The net buy of OTM puts began rising in 2004 as the RN variance and
disaster index began to fall, consistent with our model. In 2007 right before the financial
crisis, the net buy peaked. Since the financial crisis in 2008, the net buy of customers has
started to decrease while the RN variance and disaster index rose to unprecedented levels.
This indicates that the market markets have gradually decreased their supply though the
demand for OTM puts should be historically high. After the crisis, the net buy of OTM
puts decreases to be negative in some months along with the high RN variance and disaster
index. The net buy of ATM puts is mostly positive throughout this period. The time-series
pattern of ATM puts is similar as the pattern in the net buy of OTM puts. These patterns
are consistent with the basic premise of our model, that customers buy puts as insurance
while market makers write these puts.
21

[Figure 10 here]

In Table 2, we report regressions of the monthly net buy of OTM puts by customers versus
the disaster index and the RN variance over the period 1996:1-2012:12. Here and throughout
this section we compute the standard errors in all of the regressions as in Newey and West
(1987) with 15 lags to correct for the autocorrelation of the net buy. Consistent with the
model implications, in univariate regressions, the net buy is significantly decreasing in both
the disaster index and the RN variance in the full period and subperiods. We interpret the
bivariate regressions with caution because of the high correlation between the disaster index
and the RN variance. In Table 3, we report the corresponding regressions for ATM puts.
Again the results are consistent with the model implications. In univariate regressions, the
net buy is significantly decreasing in both the disaster index and the RN variance in the full
period but the coefficients are insignificant in the subperiods.

[Tables 2 and 3 here]

6.2

The Price of Puts versus the Net Buy of Puts

The model implies that an increase in the put price positively shifts the supply and negatively
shifts the demand for both OTM and ATM puts. In figure 11 , we display the model-implied
net buy of OTM puts as a function of the put price, where the put price is stated in terms
of its Black-Scholes (B-S) implied volatility. We distinguish between an increase in the put
price due to an increase in the RN variance from an increase in the put price due to an
increase in the disaster index. Keeping the RN variance constant but varying the disaster
risk, the net buy of OTM puts is decreasing the price of OTM puts (top row of figure 11 ).
Keeping the disaster probability constant but varying the RN variance, the net buy of OTM
puts is decreasing in the price of OTM puts (bottom row of figure 11 ). Thus, our model
22

implies that the net buy of OTM puts is decreasing in the price of OTM puts. Consistent
with our model implications, the observed net buy of OTM puts is decreasing in the price
of OTM puts (figure 12 ) for the full period and all the sub-periods.
[Figures 11 and 12 here]
In figure 13 we display the model-implied net buy of ATM puts as a function of the put
price, expressed in terms of its B-S implied volatility. Keeping the variance constant but
varying the disaster risk, the net buy of ATM puts is everywhere decreasing in the price
of ATM puts (top row of figure 13). Keeping the disaster risk constant but varying the
variance, the net buy of ATM puts is increasing in the price when the level of variance is low
and decreasing in the price when the variance level is high (bottom row of figure 13). Thus,
our model implies that the net buy of ATM puts may be either increasing or decreasing
in the price of ATM puts. Our model implies that the decreasing pattern between the net
buy and option prices is less significant for ATM puts than for OTM puts. Consistent with
our model implications, the observed net buy of ATM puts is decreasing in the put price
during the full sample period (figure 14). For the sub-periods, the plots do not show a clear
relationship between the net buy and the price of ATM puts.
[Figures 13 and 14 here]
In the top panel of Table 4 , we report regressions of the net buy of OTM puts on the
price of OTM puts. For the full period and the sub-periods, the regressions consistently
show a significant negative relationship between the net buy and the price of OTM puts. In
the bottom panel of Table 4 , we report regressions of the net buy of ATM puts on the price
of ATM puts. For the full period and the sub-periods, the regressions consistently show a
significant negative relationship between the net buy and the price of ATM puts. These
regressions are consistent with the model implications.
23

6.3

The IV Skew versus the Net Buy of Puts

Consistent with our model implications, the observed IV skew shows no consistent pattern
with the net buy of OTM and ATM puts. This contrasts with the implications of the model
in Gârleanu et al. (2009) which assumes exogenous demand shifts and no supply shifts. Their
Proposition 4 states that an exogenous positive shift in the demand for a certain OTM put
has a bigger pricing effect on the demand of deep OTM puts than on slightly OTM puts,
that is, the IV skew unambiguously becomes steeper.
As the disaster risk increases, keeping the RN variance constant, the price of both the
OTM and ATM puts increases. As we showed earlier in figure 6, the model implies that the
price of OTM puts increases faster than the price of ATM puts and the IV skew becomes
steeper. Furthermore, as we showed earlier in figures 8 and 9, the model implies that the
net buy of puts unambiguously decreases with the disaster index when the RN variance is
fixed. Therefore, the model predicts a negative relationship between the net buy and the IV
skew when the disaster index increases. This is illustrated in the bottom row of figure 15 for
OTM puts and the bottom row of figure 16 for ATM puts.
[Figures 15 and 16 here]
As the RN variance increases, keeping the disaster index constant, the net buy of OTM
puts and the IV skew is implied by our model as following. As we showed earlier in the
bottom row of figure 6, the model implies that the price of OTM puts increases slower than
the price of ATM puts and the IV skew becomes flatter. Furthermore, as we showed earlier
in the bottom row of figure 8, the model implies that the net buy of OTM puts also decreases
with the RN variance. Therefore, whether the net buy increases or decreases with the IV
24

skew depends on whether the skew or the net buy decreases faster with higher RN variance.
Our model predicts a positive relationship between the IV skew and the net buy of OTM
puts when we increase the RN variance. This is illustrated in the bottom row of figure 15.
In contrast, as the RN variance increases, keeping the disaster index constant, the relation
between the net buy of ATM puts and the IV skew is implied by our model as following.
as we showed earlier in the bottom row of figure 9, the model implies that the net buy of
ATM puts increases with the RN variance when the variance is relatively low and decreases
with the RN variance when the variance is relatively high. On the other hand, the IV skew
always decreases with the RN variance. Therefore, when the variance is relatively low, the
skew is relatively high and meanwhile the skew is decreasing in the RN variance. Therefore,
our model implies that the net buy is decreasing in the IV skew when the IV skew is high.
However, when the variance is relatively high, the IV skew is low and meanwhile both the
net buy and the skew are decreasing in the variance risk. Therefore, the pattern of the net
buy versus the skew again depends on which of the two decreases faster in the RN variance.
In the top row of figure 16, our model predicts that the net buy is decreasing in the IV skew
when the IV skew is high and increasing in the IV skew when the IV skew is low.
Since the RN variance and disaster index are highly correlated, our model is ambiguous
regarding the relationship between the net buy and the IV skew of both OTM and ATM
puts. These implications are consistent with the data. This is illustrated in figure 17 for
OTM puts and figure 18 for ATM puts and the regressions in Table 5 . Note that in both
figures 17 and 18 and Table 5 , before, during, and after the crisis, the relationship between
the net buy of OTM and ATM puts and the IV skew do not show a recognizable pattern.

[Table 5 and Figures 17 and 18 here]

The decreasing pattern between the skew and the net buy is most significant during the
25

crisis and for OTM puts. This is the period when the net buy of puts was primarily driven by
changes in the disaster probability rather than the RN variance. During the financial crisis,
the disaster risk is high and the market makers face a tighter constraint in terms of the VaR
even if the variance risk is the same as in other sub-periods. This leads to a steeper the
IV skew together with a less net buy of puts. Therefore, we observe a significant negative
relationship between the IV skew and net buy of both OTM and ATM puts, though the
pattern is more significant for OTM puts because of more demand in OTM puts as crash
insurance.

Concluding Remarks

We document the skew response puzzle: no-arbitrage models imply that the IV skew is decreasing in the RN variance and disaster index, contrary to the empirical evidence on S&P
500 put options. We explain the puzzle by modeling the endogenous supply and demand of
index puts. The key lies in recognizing that the principal suppliers of index puts are market
makers who are subject to exogenous credit constraints. The model captures the scenario
where risk neutral market makers write “overpriced” puts while the risk-averse public customers buy the index to maximize their utility and hedge their exposure to downside risk by
buying index puts. The model implies that the IV skew is increasing in the disaster index
and decreasing in the RN variance. Since the RN variance and disaster index is highly correlated, this leads to the observed non-decreasing IV skew in the RN variance and disaster
index.
The shift in the supply and demand for S&P 500 put options not only explains the IV
skew puzzle but also explains a novel set of empirical observations about the net buy of puts.
The model and the data consistently imply that the net buy of puts is decreasing in the RN

26

variance and disaster index. The model and the data also consistently imply that the net
buy of puts is decreasing in their price.
In our model, different months are associated with different parameter values. We make
no assumptions about the time-series process of these parameters. In future research, it is
of interest to model the time-series process of these parameters and study the time-series
process of option prices and the net buy.
The paper focuses on OTM put options that derive their value from the left-hand tail of
the index price distribution and give rise to a pronounced IV skew, unlike OTM call options
that derive their value from the right-hand tail of the distribution and give rise to either a
faint IV skew or a faint smirk. Constantinides, Czerwonko, Jackwerth, and Perrakis (2011)
and Constantinides, Jackwerth, and Perrakis (2009) showed that OTM European calls on
the S&P 500 index and OTM American calls on the S&P 500 index futures frequently imply
stochastic dominance violations: any risk averse investor who invests in a portfolio of the
index and the risk free asset increases his expected utility by writing OTM “overpriced”
calls. Therefore, even the risk-averse customers have an incentive to write OTM calls. Our
model does not capture the trading behavior of market makers and customers in OTM calls.
We leave it as a project for future research to develop a model that captures the trading
behavior of market makers and customers in OTM calls.

Appendix: The Customer’s Problem
For a given put price P , we numerically calculate the customer’s optimal decisions (α, β)
and the MM’s optimal decisions (α̂, β̂). Finally, we numerically search for the put price that
satisfies the market clearing condition β + β̂ = 0.
Before we compute the expectation in the customer’s objective function, we compute the
