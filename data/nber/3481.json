We introduce a demand for liquid assets by adding uninsured individual risk together with differential costs of trading securities. We then parameterize a class of such models and compute the stationary equilibria. The simulations indicate that attempting to match the return data generates a ratio of liquid assets to income considerably be low observed levels. We then explore some possible reasons for this discrepancy.\n\n",
