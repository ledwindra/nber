The question of who should provide education is nowhere more pressing than in developing countries.
While the academic controversy over school providers and school vouchers has raged most intensely in the
US, private schools account for only about 11% of US enrollment (USDOE, 1998). Moreover, over half of
American parents report that they are very satisfied with the public schools their children attend. In the
developing world, in contrast, private enrollment as a proportion of total enrollment is 2-3 times higher than
that in industrialized nations (James, 1993). Problems with public schools are usually more severe in lowincome countries, since the quality and integrity of public-sector service-delivery is highly correlated with
income levels (Rauch and Evans, 2000). In Indian schools, for example, a recent study found that one-third
of headmasters were absent at the time of the researchers' visit (PROBE Team, 1999), while in Kenya,
Glewwe, Kremer, and Moulin (2000) found that teachers were absent 28% of the time. The view that private
schools function better than public schools in the developing world has prompted calls for governments in
poor countries to experiment with demand-side financing programs such as vouchers (e.g, Psacharopolous,
Tan, and Jimenez, 1986).
This paper presents evidence on the impact of one of the largest school voucher programs to date, the
Programa de Ampliación de Cobertura de la Educación Secundaria (PACES), a Colombian program which
provided over 125,000 pupils with vouchers covering somewhat more than half the cost of private secondary
school. Vouchers could be renewed as long as students maintained satisfactory academic performance. Since
many vouchers were awarded by lottery, we use a quasi-experimental research design comparing educational
and other outcomes of lottery winners and losers. Subject to a variety of caveats, the resulting estimates
provide evidence on program effects similar to those arising from a randomized trial. As far as we know, ours
is the first study of a private school voucher program in a developing country to take advantage of randomized
treatment.1

1

US studies in this mold include Green, Peterson, and Du (1996) and Rouse (1998), who evaluated a voucher lottery
in Milwaukee. Rouse’s estimates, which control for attrition, show modest increases in math scores among voucher
recipients. Other US studies include Howell et al (2000), Myers et al (2000) and Bettinger (2001a), who evaluate
various private scholarship programs. Also related is McEwan and Carnoy (1999), who report differences-indifferences estimates of spillover effects from a large-scale voucher program in Chile. Bellow and King (1993)
assess a smaller program in Bangladesh. The literature on public/private comparisons in the US is extensive. Two
recent studies are Evans and Schwab (1995) and Neal (1997). Cox and Jimenez (1991) compare public and private

Our research strategy was to survey lottery winners and losers from three applicant cohorts. The
results from this survey show no significant enrollment differences between lottery losers and winners three
years after application, with most pupils in both the winner and loser groups still in school. But lottery
winners were 15 percentage points more likely to attend private schools rather than public schools. Moreover,
lottery winners had completed an additional .1 years of school and were about 10 percentage points more
likely than losers to have completed 8th grade, primarily because they repeated fewer grades. Although high
rates of grade repetition are a widely recognized problem in Latin America (see, e.g., Jacoby, 1994; and
Psacharopoulos and Velez, 1993), reduced repetition need not indicate greater learning. We therefore
administered achievement tests to a subset of the pupils surveyed. The test results suggest that, on average,
lottery winners scored about .2 standard deviations higher than losers, a large but only marginally significant
difference. The effect on girls is larger and more precisely estimated than the effect on boys.
In addition to increased educational attainment and academic achievement, there is also some
evidence that the voucher program affected non-educational outcomes. In particular, lottery winners were
less likely to be married or cohabiting and worked about 1.2 fewer hours per week (again, mostly a difference
for girls). Both of these results suggest an increased focus on schooling among winners.
While comparisons between winners and losers provide a simple strategy for assessing program
impact, our survey indicates that only about 90% of lottery winners had ever used the voucher or any other
type of scholarship, while 24% of losers received scholarships from other sources. It therefore seems
reasonable to think of lottery win/loss status as an instrument for scholarship receipt in a two-stage least
squares (2SLS) set-up. There is a strong first-stage here, though the relationship between voucher status and
scholarship use is not deterministic. Instrumenting for scholarship use with lottery win/loss status suggests
that scholarship use generated effects on grade completion and test scores that are roughly 50% larger than

schools in Colombia and Tanzania, and Jimenez, Lockheed, and Paqueo (1991) summarize comparisons in five
countries. See also the Patrinos and Ariasingham (1997) survey of demand-side financing in poor countries.
Glewwe, Kremer, and Moulin (2000) and Behrman, Sengupta, and Todd (2000) use randomization to examine other
educational interventions in developing countries.

the reduced form effect of winning the lottery.
The last part of the paper presents a fiscal and cost-benefit analysis of the voucher program. Most
lottery winners would have attended private school anyway, at least for a few years, and therefore reduced
their educational expenditure in response to the program. On the other hand, voucher winners who were
induced to switch from public to private schools greatly increased their educational expenditure, since the
voucher covered only about half the cost of private school. On balance, winners’ gross school fees exceeded
those of losers by about 70% of the amount they received from the voucher. This increase comes from the
discrete jump in fees for those who switched from public to private schools, and from the fact that winners
who would have gone to private school anyway spent more on school fees, possibly because they went to
better schools. Moreover, lottery winners worked less, so that, on balance, households winning the lottery
actually devoted more resources to education than the voucher face value. We also estimate that the voucher
program cost the government about $24 more per winner than the cost of creating a public school placement.
These costs to participants and the government are likely to have been outweighed by the benefits of the
voucher to participants -- in the form of the economic return to increased educational attainment and test
scores.
The paper is organized as follows. Section I provides background on education in Colombia and
describes the PACES program in more detail. Section II discusses data and presents descriptive statistics from
our survey. Section III discusses the effect of the program on school choice and basic educational outcomes.
Section IV reports the effect of winning a voucher on test scores and non-education outcomes. Section V
discusses the use of lottery win/loss status as an instrument to identify the causal effect of receiving a
scholarship. Finally, Section VI looks at the effect of the program on household and government expenditure,
and compares program costs with the benefits to participants.

I. Background
The Colombian government established the PACES program in late 1991 as part of a wider
decentralization effort and in an attempt to expand private provision of public services (King et al, 1997).
The program, which was partly funded by the World Bank, was also motivated as an effort to quickly expand
school capacity and to raise secondary school enrollment rates (King, Orazem, and Wolgemuth, 1998).2
Although 89% of Colombia’s primary-school age children were enrolled in 1993, only 75% of the eligible
population was enrolled in secondary schools. Among children of eligible age in the poorest quintile of the
population, 78% were enrolled in primary school, but only 55% were enrolled in secondary school (Sanchez
and Mendez, 1995; note that secondary school covers grades 6-11 in Colombia.)
The PACES program targeted low-income families by offering vouchers only to children residing in
neighborhoods classified as falling into the two lowest socioeconomic strata (out of 6 possible strata).
Applicants had to submit a utility bill to establish residential location and voucher eligibility. A second
important feature of program targeting was that vouchers were offered only to children attending public
primary schools. This restriction further excluded upper-income households since almost half of children
from the richest income quintile attended private primary schools. Studies by Morales-Cobo (1993) and
Ribero and Tenjo (1997) suggests that the targeting was largely effective in Bogota.
PACES vouchers were worth only about US$190 at the time of our survey. The maximum voucher
value was set initially to correspond to the average tuition of low-to-middle cost private schools in Colombia’s
three largest cities. Schools charging less than the vouchers’ face value received only their usual tuition.
PACES vouchers became less generous over time because they did not keep up with inflation, and hence
recipients had to supplement vouchers with additional payments to cover school fees. Our survey data show

2

PACES was launched in November 1991 with advertisements in print and on radio soliciting applicants in
participating cities (Calderon, 1996). A World Bank (1993) report on Colombian secondary schools notes that most
schools operated 2 or 3 shifts and that some towns have little room for additional pupils in spite of projected
enrollment growth. Other problems mentioned in the report include poor primary-school preparation, weak school
management, lack of teacher preparedness, lack of textbooks, and shortages of other supplemental materials. The
early 1990s was a general period of reform and liberalization in Colombia; see, for example, Kugler (1999).

matriculation and monthly fees for private schools attended by voucher applicants in 1998 averaged about
$340. By way of comparison, the average annual per-pupil public expenditure in Colombia’s public
secondary school system in 1995 was just over $350 (DNP, 1999), and public school parents in our sample
typically had to pay tuition or fees of roughly $58. Per capita GNP in Colombia is now around $2,280 (World
Bank, 1999).
To qualify for a voucher, applicants must have been entering the Colombian secondary school cycle
which begins with grade 6, and be aged 15 or under. They must also have been admitted to a participating
secondary school (i.e., one that would accept the voucher).3 Participating schools had to be located in
participating towns, which included all of Colombia’s largest cities. Just under half of private schools in the
10 largest cities accepted vouchers in 1993.
Participating schools tended to serve lower-income pupils, and to have lower tuition than nonparticipating private schools. Schools with a vocational curriculum were also over-represented among those
in the program. Initially, vouchers were good at both for-profit and non-profit schools, but after 1996, forprofit schools were excluded.4 The number of vouchers in use in any one year peaked at roughly 90,000 in
1994 and 1995. There were approximately 3.1 million secondary school pupils in Colombia in 1995, 37%
of whom attended private schools. In Bogota, roughly 58% of 567,000 secondary school pupils attended
private school.
Test score comparisons reported by King et al (1997) show achievement levels in participating private
schools were very close to those in public schools, though significantly below achievement levels in nonparticipating private schools. Similarly, pupil-teacher ratios and facilities were similar in public and
participating private schools, while non-participating private schools had lower pupil-teacher ratios and the

Problems were reported with low-quality schools created to exploit the vouchers. But Calderon (1996) notes that

best facilities. Clearly, then, relatively elite private schools opted-out of the PACES program. One reason
for this may have been a reluctance to interact with the bureaucracy in the Colombian Institute for Education,
Credit and Training Abroad (ICETEX), a government agency that ran the program. Moreover, vouchers were
insufficient to cover much of the tuition at more expensive schools, and some school managers probably
viewed the prospect of an influx of pupils from low-income backgrounds as undesirable. On the other hand,
many private schools in Colombia serving low-income populations apparently welcomed the PACES program.
Voucher recipients were eligible for automatic renewal through eleventh grade, when Colombian high
school ends, provided the recipient’s academic performance warranted promotion to the next grade. Students
failing a grade were supposed to be dropped from the PACES program. Figures from Calderon (1996) show
that, on average, 77% of recipients renewed their vouchers, and estimates from our data are similar. By way
of comparison, the national high school promotion rate was about 70%. Students who transferred from one
participating private school to another could, in principle, transfer the voucher to the new school. In practice,
however, our survey suggests many students who transferred schools after winning lost their vouchers.
Cities and towns used lotteries to allocate vouchers when demand exceeded supply. Municipal
governments paid 20% of the voucher cost, while the central government paid 80%. Each municipality
decided how many vouchers to fund, subject to a maximum allocated to towns by the central government.
This allocation was determined by estimating the shortfall between primary school enrollment and the
available space in public secondary schools. Voucher award rates therefore varied considerably by city and
year, depending on the ratio of applicants to available vouchers. Regional ICETEX offices worked with
individual municipalities to determine the number of vouchers to be funded, to check school requirements for
participation, and to monitor implementation of the program. The Bogota ICETEX office provided software
and instructions to regional offices for the purposes of random selection of applicants in cases of oversubscription. We obtained copies of lists of lottery winners and losers from ICETEX offices.5

In a few cities, the local ICETEX office assigned vouchers based on pupils’ primary school performance instead of
randomly.

II. The Applicant Survey
A. Descriptive Statistics
Beginning in the summer of 1998, we interviewed roughly 1,600 PACES applicants, stratifying to
obtain approximately equal numbers of winners and losers. Interviewing was limited to the 1995 and 1997
applicant cohorts from Bogota and the 1993 applicant cohort from Jamundi, a suburb of Cali. These years
and cities were chosen for a combination of scientific and practical reasons. The largest and longest-running
voucher program was in Bogota, and our survey team is based there. Cali is Colombia's second largest city
and therefore also important, but almost no Cali applicants had phones, so we concentrated on a suburb,
Jamundi. Telephones were used for the majority of interviews, primarily to reduce costs, but also because
of interviewer safety and logistical considerations. In principle, the lottery was random within localities and
conditional on whether households have access to a telephone (even if it is a neighbor’s phone). The results
should therefore yield internally valid estimates of the causal effect of the program on voucher applicants with
access to a telephone in surveyed cities. Over 80% of applicants had access to a phone, and in the Bogota
1995 cohort, 88% had access to a phone.
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the sampling frame, attempted contacts and completed
interviews.6 There were 6,156 applicants in the three applicant cohorts of interest. We attempted to interview
almost 3,000 applicants, obtaining an overall response rate of 54% and a response rate of almost 61% for the
1997 Bogota lottery. The higher response rate in the most recent lottery is not surprising since contact
information for 1997 applicants is more recent. Interviews were completed with 55% of lottery winners and
53% of lottery losers. Although this response rate is far from ideal, the fact that winners and losers were
almost equally likely to be interviewed is encouraging because the question of sample selection bias turns on
whether voucher status is correlated with response probabilities (see, e.g., Angrist, 1997). Because response
probabilities are virtually uncorrelated with voucher status, there should be little bias from our failure to

interview all applicants.7
The typical applicant was about 13 years old at the time of application, while average age on the
survey date varied from 13 for 1997 applicants to 17 for 1993 applicants. About half of the applicants were
male. Roughly 85% of applicants were still in school, enrolled in grades ranging from 6th for the 1997 cohort
to 8th or 9th for the 1993 cohort. The descriptive statistics also show that almost 90% of the applicants we
interviewed started 6th grade in private school. This reflects the fact that eligibility for PACES vouchers was
conditional on admission to a participating private school. Thus, most lottery losers went to private school
anyway, at least for one year. On the other hand, only 63% of applicants were still in private school as of the
survey date.

B. Personal Characteristics and Voucher Status
There is little evidence of any association between win/loss status and the individual characteristics
measured in our data from Bogota, although winners and losers are less comparable in the 1993 Jamundi
cohort. This can be seen in Table 2, which reports means and differences by win/loss status for all applicants
in the study population, for sampled applicants, and for the sample of completed surveys. The sampling
process began with lists showing applicant ID numbers, names, addresses, and phone numbers, separately for
winners and losers. To obtain demographic characteristics for all applicants, whether surveyed or not, we
imputed applicant age using ID numbers (which incorporate birthdays). We note, however, that our strategy
of imputing ages is subject to error since 13% of applicants have invalid ID numbers.8 We excluded
7

The vast majority of non-responders were people we could not reach by telephone, either because they had moved or
because the telephone number we had no longer worked. Roughly 3% of families contacted refused to answer. The
only significant difference in response rates by win/loss status is for the Jamundi cohort. In what follows, we present
results for the Bogota 1995 cohort and the combined cohorts separately. Complete follow-up is the holy grail of
education research. Even careful evaluation studies using randomized and quasi-randomized designs (e.g., Rouse,
1998; Krueger and Whitmore, 2001) are based on samples with substantial loss to follow-up. Similarly, Howell et al
(2000) report follow-up rates similar to ours for US voucher trials in three cities.

8

Plausible IDs have 11 digits, the first 6 of which record birth dates. Correct ID numbers satisfy an equation
involving a control digit and the other 10 digits. Random deviations, say, because of incomplete recording,
transposition of digits, or errors in a single digit, fail to satisfy this algorithm with very high probability. The check
formula is as follows. Let the jth digit be dj, for j=1,10 and d11 be the control digit. Let {cj; j=1,11} be the sequence

8

observations in which the applicant was younger than 9 or older than 25. In practice, this restriction affected
few observations. A second variable from the applicant record is gender. We used first names to assign sex
for about 80% of the applicants. A final variable from the applicant record is a dummy for whether the record
included a phone number.
Winners and losers have similar telephone access, age, and sex mix in the 1995 and 1997 Bogota data.
As a further check on randomness, we compared win rates by school in those schools with more than 20
applicants to city averages in the Bogota data from 1995. No school had a win rate that differed significantly
from the city average. In the Jamundi-93 sample, however, there are significant differences in average age
and gender by win/loss status. Because the differences between winners and losers in the Jamundi lottery may
indicate non-random assignment of vouchers, and because the 1997 Bogota cohort is too recent for a good
reading on some outcomes, we present results from the Bogota-95 sample separately from the results for the
pooled sample including all three cohorts.

III. Impact on Scholarship Use, School Choice, and Schooling
Our estimates of lottery effects are based on the following regression model:

The coefficient of interest is α0. We estimate (1) using three sets of control variables: “no controls”, i.e.,

A. Effects on Scholarship Use and School Choice
We begin with a simple analysis of the effect of winning the lottery on private school scholarship
receipt and the choice between public and private school. The most immediate effect of the lottery was to
increase the likelihood of receiving a private school scholarship. This can be seen in the first row of Table
3, which shows that at the time of our survey, voucher winners were 51 percentage points more likely than
losers to have been using some kind of scholarship. Not all winners were using their PACES vouchers in the
survey year. This is because 15% of winners were not in school at all, and another 16% were in public
schools, and therefore ineligible for scholarships. Some lottery winners also lost their voucher after repeating
a grade (7%), while 5% switched to non-participating private schools or failed to complete the paperwork for
a transfer. Others attended schools that stopped accepting vouchers or lost their vouchers for unreported
reasons. Just as not all winners were using a scholarship, some losers obtained scholarships from programs
other than PACES and one loser was awarded a PACES voucher after re-applying the following year.
At the time of the survey, enrollment rates were .83 for losers and .85 for winners in the Bogota-95
sample, an insignificant difference. The estimates in Table 3 also show that most PACES applicants entered
6th grade in a private secondary school, and most finished 6th grade whether or not they won a voucher. But
lottery winners were 6-7 percentage points more likely than losers to have begun 6th grade in private school,
and 15-16 percentage points more likely to be in private school at the time of our survey. The effect of
winning the PACES lottery on the probability of private school attendance was even larger in 7th grade,
probably because losers were more likely to have left private school by then.
These results suggest the decision between public and private school was sensitive to variation in the
price of private school induced by the program, while the decision whether to attend school was not.9 This
is consistent with a model in which those households most willing and able to pay for education attend private
school; a middle group attends public school; and those least willing or able to pay do not attend at all. In this

9

We can convert the private-school enrollment effects to an elasticity as follows. PACES vouchers reduced the
marginal cost of private school attendance by about 50%, while vouchers increased private school enrollment in 7th
grade by about 17%. The implied elasticity of private enrollment with respect to marginal cost is therefore .34.

10

case, no one is on the private school/no school margin, and so small subsidies to private education do not
directly increase overall enrollment.10 Since many public schools in Colombia were turning away applicants
due to overcrowding, PACES is likely to have opened up places in public school for other pupils by reducing
public-school queuing.

B. Effects on Schooling
Lottery winners completed more schooling than losers, and were less likely to repeat grades. For
example, lottery losers had completed 7.5 years of schooling at the time of our survey, but winners in the 1995
Bogota sample completed an additional .12-.16 years (.8 years in the full sample). As noted earlier, there was
no statistically significant effect on enrollment. The effect on years of schooling and the lack of an effect on
enrollment is primarily the result of a reduced probability of grade repetition for winners. This is reflected
in a sharp increase in the likelihood lottery winners had finished 8th grade as of the survey date, with a smaller
impact on 7th grade completion. In the Bogota-95 sample, over 20% of losers had repeated a grade since
beginning 6th grade, and almost 20% repeated 6th grade. But the probability of grade repetition was reduced
by 5-6 percentage points for lottery winners.
The estimates of α0 change little as the list of control variables changes, a result to be expected since
the voucher lottery was random. The estimation results are also similar in the Bogota-95 and full samples,
and are largely invariant to the inclusion of neighborhood effects. Estimates and standard errors for the
Bogota 1995 sample also change little in models with school effects.
Separate results by sex, reported in Table 4, show moderately larger effects on educational attainment
for girls, though the pattern of sex differences in the effects on private school enrollment are not clear cut.
Results for the Bogota-95 sample show male lottery winners with an insignificant 0.12 more years of
schooling while female lottery winners obtained 0.14 years more of schooling, a statistically significant effect.

10

PACES subsidies were initially large enough to cover the entire cost of private school, and may have shifted
recipients from no school to private school when the program started. However, the voucher value was later eroded
by inflation.

11

Differences by sex are more pronounced in the full sample, with an insignificant 0.06 more years of schooling
for boys, and a statistically significant 0.12 more years of schooling for girls. It should also be noted that
while effects for boys are almost entirely due to grade repetition, the effects for girls appear to come from both
reduced grade repetition and additional time spent in school.11
The greater probability of 8th grade completion and lower repetition rates for lottery winners seem like
desirable outcomes. In fact, high rates of grade repetition in Latin America are widely seen as symptomatic
of poorly functioning public schools.12 But the interpretation of these effects is complicated by the fact that
pupils who failed a grade were supposed to forfeit PACES vouchers. Private schools may therefore have had
an incentive to promote pupils with vouchers even if their performance did not meet normal promotional
standards. To explore this possibility, we look at effects on test scores and non-educational outcomes in the
next section.

IV. Effects on Test Scores and Non-Education Outcomes
A. Effects on Test Scores
We tested children from the 1995 applicant cohort in three Bogota neighborhoods.

These

neighborhoods were chosen because they had relatively large numbers of winners and losers, and because of
the availability of suitable testing sites. The tests were administered in 1999, approximately one year after
our household survey. The test sample was drawn from applicants for whom we had survey data. Participants
were solicited by telephone, followed by hand delivery of letters describing the purpose of the test and inviting
pupils to be tested. Those who failed to appear on the test day were invited again for a second testing, except
at the last sitting. To encourage participation, refreshments were provided at each site, and each test
concluded with the raffle of a bicycle and other prizes. Pupils were also given 5 or 10 thousand pesos (US

11

There is little evidence that the effect of winning the voucher varied with applicants' socioeconomic strata of
residence or parents’ education. However, estimates for subgroups are imprecise.

12

For example, Psacharopolous and Velez (1993) and Harbison and Hanushek (1992) use repetition rates as a
measure of school quality in Colombia and Brazil.

12

$3.23 or $6.45) to cover travel costs.

The invitation letter noted the offer of refreshments, travel

reimbursement, and raffle. See the data appendix for additional details on the testing set-up.
Our evaluation used La Prueba de Realizacion, a grade-specific multiple-choice achievement test for
native Spanish speakers, published by Riverside. We administered only the mathematics, reading, and writing
subtests, each taking about 30 minutes. This test was chosen because Colombian educators participated in
test development and the test had been used previously in Colombia (Cole et al, 1993). An appendix table
compares test results from the Hispanic-American test-norming populations for grades 9 and 10 with the
results from our test. Colombian 9th graders scored lower than American pupils in mathematics, but they had
reading skills slightly better than American 10th graders. The average Colombian writing score was close to
the average score for American 10th graders.

The Test Sample
The pupils invited to be tested were not a random sample, but they have characteristics similar to
those in the full Bogota 1995 sample. This can be seen in the first two columns of Table 5, which describe
the characteristics of all 1,176 Bogota 1995 applicants surveyed, and the 473 applicants invited for testing.
Of those invited, 283 were tested, a response rate of 60%. Those tested were younger, and came from a poorer
background as measured by father’s education and wages, than the no-shows. Importantly, however, there
is no significant relationship between the probability of being tested and voucher status. Also encouraging
is the fact that, conditional on taking the test, there is little evidence of differences in personal characteristics
between winners and losers. Differences by voucher status are reported in column 5 of Table 5.

Test results
Table 6 reports estimates of the effect of winning the voucher lottery on test scores. Columns 1 and

13

2 of Table 6 show results from models with and without covariates.13 Columns 3 and 4 present the results of
estimating a single voucher coefficient for stacked subject results, in models with a pupil random effect. That
is, we estimated:
yis = XiNβ0 + α0Zi + δi + εis,

(2)

where yis is pupil i’s score in subject s, and δi is a random effect used to adjust standard errors for the fact that
there is likely to be within-pupil correlation across subjects. Note that test score results are reported in
standard deviation units.
Lottery winners scored just over .2 standard deviations more than lottery losers, though this difference
is (not surprisingly, given the small test sample) only marginally significant. According to US norms for La
Prueba, 2/10 of a standard deviation is roughly the score gain associated with one additional school year (Cole
et al, 1993). This effect should probably therefore be seen as large, in view of the fact that subjects were
tested three years after applying to the program. Lottery winners also scored higher on all subtests, though
the only significant difference is for reading scores (t=1.8). The results for the stacked subjects, reported in
columns 3 and 4, also show marginally significantly higher scores for lottery winners, with the largest effects
for models that stack math and reading scores only.
Models estimated separately for boys and girls generate larger and more precise effects for girls than
boys. For example, the estimated effect on total points for girls, reported in column 2 of Panel B for models
with covariates, is .26 (s.e.=.12). The corresponding estimate for boys, reported in Panel C, is .17 (s.e.=.18).
The finding of a stronger effect on girls echoes some of the survey results.
Earlier we noted that the fact that lottery winners were less likely to repeat grades may have been due
to a reduction in promotion standards for lottery winners, as well as any increased learning or change in school
quality. Further evidence that the grade repetition results are not due solely to schools' lowering the bar for
promotion of winners is provided by comparing the test scores of winners and losers who were promoted.

13

The results in column 1 and 3 are from models that include site dummies only. The results in columns 2 and 4 are
from models that include controls for age, sex, parents’ schooling, strata of residence, type of interview, and survey
form.

14

To see this, suppose that both test scores and grade promotion depend on underlying learning, but the program
itself had no effect on achievement. This scenario can be shown to imply that if promotion standards are
relaxed for winners, then average test scores for lottery winners who are promoted should be lower than
average test scores for lottery losers who are promoted.14 In practice, the composite test scores of winners
who were promoted are about .14 standard deviations greater than the scores of promoted losers, although
the difference is not significant.

B. Other Outcomes
Table 7 reports estimates of the effect of winning the lottery on non-educational outcomes.
Approximately 1.6% of lottery losers from Bogota were married or living with a companion, a low proportion
consistent with the fact that the average age of survey respondents was about 15. Since this outcome is rare,
we estimated probit models as well as linear probability models.
Both probit marginal effects and OLS estimates suggest that marriage and cohabitation were reduced
for lottery winners, a marginally significant effect. There is also some evidence from the pooled sample that
lottery winners were less likely to be working than losers, with the largest effects in Bogota. There is also
a significant difference in hours worked. In particular, lottery winners worked 1.2 fewer hours per week than
losers. This effect is larger and more precisely estimated for girls. The reduction in work may be due to
income effects for the household, the greater time demands of private school relative to public school, or
increased incentives for lottery winners to spend time studying so as to avoid failing a grade and losing the
PACES voucher.

14

Suppose schools promote if a random variable x is greater than a cutoff c, which takes on two values, cW for
winners and cL for losers. Suppose cW < cL, but test scores, T, and the variable x are unaffected by winning the
lottery. Then the expected test score for lottery losers who are promoted is E(T| x > cL). The expected score for
winners will be a weighted average of this and E(T| cW < x < cL). Average scores for promoted losers will therefore
exceed average scores for promoted winners as long as E(T| x) is increasing in x.

15

V. Instrumental Variables Estimates of Scholarship Effects
The analysis so far focuses on reduced form effects of winning the lottery. In the discussion of Table
3, however, we noted that some lottery losers were awarded other scholarships, while some winners failed
to use or retain their PACES scholarships. This section reports 2SLS estimates of the effect of ever receiving
any scholarship using voucher win/loss status as an instrumental variable (IV). While only 6% of lottery
losers used a scholarship at the time of the survey, 24% had used a scholarship at some point. In contrast,
90% of winners used a scholarship at some time. The 2SLS estimates based on this difference are necessarily
larger than the reduced form effects of winning the lottery since winning the lottery is only imperfectly
correlated with receiving a scholarship.
The assumption that a scholarship use dummy satisfies an exclusion restriction in an instrumental
variables (IV) setup motivates 2SLS estimation of the equation:
yi = XiNβ1 + α1si + ξi,

(3)

where si is a dummy for scholarship use, and Xi is the vector of “basic controls” used in previous tables. The
associated first-stage relationship using Zi as an instrument is
si = XiNγ + πZi + ηi,

(4)

The estimate of π is about .66 (s.e.=.021), so the second-stage estimates can be expected to be about 50%
larger than the corresponding reduced form estimates. The interpretation of α1 in this case is as an
approximate effect of treatment on the subset of scholarship users who would not have used a scholarship
without PACES (Imbens and Angrist, 1994).
The 2SLS estimate of the effect of scholarship use on highest grade completed is about .2 in the
Bogota-95 sample and .13 in the full sample. These estimates are reported in Table 8. 2SLS estimates of
voucher effects on the probability of finishing eighth grade are 13-15 percentage points, nearly a 25% increase
in completion rates. This is large by the standards of the literature on the enrollment effects of financial aid
for college (see, e.g., Fuller, Manski, and Wise, 1982; Kane, 1995), though we know of no comparable results
for subsidies to private secondary schools. Another interesting result is the 2SLS estimate of the effect on

16

test scores, .29, somewhat smaller than the corresponding OLS estimate. The 2SLS estimates are likely to
be more useful for predicting the impact of scholarship programs on new scholarship recipients than are the
reduced form effects, which are diluted by take-up rates less than one and the availability of alternative
financing.

VI. Impact on Household and Government Expenditure
This section discusses the impact of the program on household and government budgets. We begin
by showing that approximately 70% of voucher funds flowed to education, with the remainder going to
educational spending that households would have made without the voucher. Taking into account the
reduction in work by lottery winners suggests that winning the lottery induced households to devote more net
resources to education. The higher fees paid by voucher winners are due primarily to winners’ greater
likelihood of attending private school. However, there is also some evidence that applicants who would have
attended private schools anyway traded up to more expensive private schools in response to winning the
voucher. Since the voucher did not reduce the cost of private school at the margin, this result weighs against
the simplest models of education as human capital investment without credit constraints. The results in
section B suggest that it cost the government about $24 more per lottery winner to provide school places
through PACES than through the public system. Finally, section C aggregates the impact on households,
schools, and the government budget, arguing that the total social costs of providing additional school places
through the PACES voucher system were small, and therefore dwarfed by the benefits of the program to
participants. The analysis in this section uses data for the 1995 Bogota applicant cohort only.

A. Impact on Household Educational Expenditure
Three years after the 1995 lottery in Bogota, about 55% of winners and 5% of losers were still
receiving scholarships (a result from Table 3 repeated in the first row of Table 9 for the sample of
observations with usable fee data). As noted earlier, 53% of losers were still in private school in the survey

17

year, with an increase of about 15% for winners.
Among applicants to the Bogota 95 lottery, winners received an average of $74 more in scholarship
aid than losers, result reported in the fourth row of Table 9. Conditional on receiving a scholarship,
scholarship amounts were similar for winners and losers, at roughly $200. The estimates in Table 9 also show
gross matriculation and tuition fees were $52 greater for lottery winners than losers. Thus, the 1998 voucher
expenditures of $74 per winner caused an increase of $52 in gross fees for winners, about 70% of the extra
amount received by winners on average. The remaining $22 of voucher funds presumably increased noneducational expenditures by lottery winners.15
Aside from paying for school fees, households bear the opportunity cost of the effort students devote
to education. The estimates for non-educational outcomes in Table 7 suggest lottery winners spent 1.2 fewer
hours working each week. According to our survey data, the average hourly wage was 71 cents.16 Assuming
that students work 48 weeks per year, this reduction corresponds to an opportunity cost of 1.2 x $.71 x 48
weeks, approximately $41. Combining the increase of $52 in expenditures on fees and the $41 of lost
earnings, we estimate that PACES lottery winners devoted $93 more to education than losers in the survey
year, or 126% of the $74 in extra scholarship assistance they received.

Disaggregating Effects on Fees
While winning households spent about $52 more on school fees, on average, this average conceals
important heterogeneity. Since vouchers covered only part of the cost of private school, families with children
who were induced to switch to private school increased their educational expenditure sharply. However, most
of the applicants who lost the lottery started private school in 6th grade anyway, and over half were still in

15

The estimated displacement of private expenditure is even lower when a more comprehensive expenditure measure
is used. Lottery winners report an estimated $84 more in comprehensive scholarship assistance (i.e., including
expenditure on uniforms and textbooks) and an extra $74 more in comprehensive educational expenditure.

16

Conditional on working, the average daily wage in our sample is $5.71. We estimate the hourly wage assuming a 7hour work day.

18

private school in the survey year. So most vouchers were received by applicants who would have attended
private school without the vouchers.
Simple models of education as human capital investment with perfect credit markets suggest that since
PACES vouchers were worth only $190 per year, while most private schools cost over $300 per year, vouchers
were infra-marginal. In other words, vouchers were not large enough to have caused households to increase
educational spending by choosing a more expensive private school.17 On the other hand, winning the voucher
could have led households to choose more expensive private schools if educational spending is limited by
credit constraints or if education has consumption value as well as investment value.
In a non-causal, purely accounting sense, the $52 of increased expenditure by winners on school fees
can be decomposed into the effects of increased private school enrollment, and a switch to more expensive
private schools by winners. Let Z be a dummy for lottery win/loss status as before, except we now drop i
subscripts to simplify notation. Also, let R denote type of school attended (1 for private, 0 for public) and let
F denote education expenditure. Gross school fees conditional on lottery win/loss status (i.e, fees paid by
pupils without subtracting voucher amounts) are equal to
E[F| Z] = E[F| Z, R=1]P[R=1| Z] + E[F| Z, R=0]P[R=0| Z].
The overall change in fees is a linear combination of changes in public/private enrollment and changes in fees
charged by school type. We can simplify the fee contrast between winners and losers using the fact that public
school fees changed little and overall school enrollment was also affected little, so that P[R=1| Z=1]-P[R=1|
Z=0] .-{P[R=0| Z=1]-P[R=0| Z=0]}. Then we have the accounting relationship:
E[F| Z=1]-E[F| Z=0]
= {E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=1, R=0]}{P[R=1| Z=1]-P[R=1| Z=0]}
+ P[R=1| Z=0]{E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=0, R=1]}.

(5)

In words, the overall fee increase is caused by the private-public fee difference for winners, times private-

17

To see this, note that if education is pure human capital investment, people choose schools so that a school costing
one dollar more generates exactly one more dollar of present discounted earnings. For people who would in any case
have attended a school costing more than $190, the voucher does not affect this first order condition.

19

school enrollment effects of the program, plus the win/loss contrast in fees for private-school pupils.18 The
right hand side components of (5) are as follows:
P[R=1| Z=1]-P[R=1| Z=0] = .15
E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=1, R=0] = 343-58=285
E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=0, R=1] = 11
P[R=1| Z=0] = .53.
This implies a total effect of $49, which is less than $52 because of the approximation used to simplify (5),
with $43 due to school switching. Thus, in an accounting sense, the bulk of the change in household
expenditure can be attributed to increased private school enrollment. However, for reasons discussed below,
this decomposition provides an incomplete picture of the causal effect of the program on the fee distribution.
Causal effects on fees for families who would have sent their children to private school anyway are
difficult to measure since we do not know who these families are. Simply comparing fees by win/loss status
conditional on private school attendance (the second term in (5), above) leads to a biased estimate that is
almost certainly too low. To see this, let F0 be the public or private fee a pupil would pay if he or she loses
the lottery and let F1 be the public or private fee he or she would pay if he or she wins, and let R0 and R1
denote private school attendance if a pupil loses or wins the lottery respectively. Similarly, let f0 be the private
school fee a pupil would pay if he or she loses the lottery and let f1 be the private school fee a pupil would
pay if he or she wins. Thus f0 = F0×R0 and f1 = F1×R1. We imagine that these variables are defined for every
pupil, though in practice, we can only observe F0 , R0, and f0 for losers and F1, R1, and f1 for winners. E[f1 f0| f0>0] is the effect on fees for those who would attend private school even if they were to lose the lottery.
The observed contrast in fees for private school pupils can be written as follows
E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=0, R=1] = E[f1 - f0| f0>0] + {E[f1| f1>0] - E[f1| f0>0]}

18

Without simplification the comparison is

E[F| Z=1]-E[F| Z=0]
= P[R=1| Z=0]{E[F| Z=1, R=1]-E[F| Z=0, R=1]} + E[F| Z=1, R=1]{P[R=1| Z=1]-P[R=1| Z=0]}
+ P[R=0| Z=0]{E[F| Z=1, R=0]-E[F| Z=0, R=0]} + E[F| Z=1, R=0]{P[R=0| Z=1]-P[R=0| Z=0]}.

20

(6)

The term in curly brackets comes from selection bias in the conditional-on-positive contrast. Under mild
assumptions, this term is negative.19 Assuming, as seems likely, that f1$f0, the left hand side therefore is a
lower bound on the causal effect, E[f1 - f0| f0>0].
The parameter E[f1 - f0| f0>0] is not identified without further assumptions (see, e.g., Chamberlain,
1986), though the previous discussion suggests we can treat the observed contrast in fees for private school
students as a lower bound. Under mild assumptions, we can obtain a reasonably tight upper bound on this
and a related family of parameters: E[f1 - f0| f0>m0(θ)] where m0(θ) is the θ-quantile of the losers’ fee
distribution. By choosing m0(θ)=0, we bound E[f1 - f0| f0>0], while picking points at higher quantiles, we
measure the effect on those who would have spent more on private schooling in the absence of the lottery.
For example, we can bound the effect of winning the lottery on private school fees for those who would have
spent more than the voucher amount ($190) on private school fees in the absence of the lottery. This result
is stated formally below:

Proposition. Suppose that F1 $ F0. Let m0(θ) be the θ quantile of the distribution F for losers, with m1(θ)
defined similarly for winners. Then
E[f1-f0| f0>m0(θ)] #{E[F| Z=1, F>m1(θ)] - E[F| Z=0, F>m0(θ)]}/P[R=1| Z=0, F>m0(θ)].

(6)

Proof. Define FM = F01(F0 # m0(θ)) + F01(F0 >m0(θ), R0=0) + F11(F0 >m0(θ), R0=1). Note that FM = F1 for
households above the quantile who would have attended private schools anyway. Otherwise, FM = F0. So F1
$ FM $ F0. Let pθ = P[R0=1| F0>m0(θ)]. Then

19

This is easy to show in a model where f1=h(f0) for any increasing transformation. More generally, winners who
attend private school only if they win probably attend cheaper private schools than those who attend regardless in a
variety of plausible models. Suppose, for example, that school quality complements ability and higher quality
schools are more expensive. Then low-ability children attend public schools if they lose the lottery and attend cheap
private schools if they win the lottery, while high-ability children attend expensive private schools whether or not
they win a voucher. Alternatively, consider a model with credit constraints in which the poor attend public school;
the rich attend private school; and the very rich attend expensive private schools. Then lottery winners who would
have attended public school if they lost the lottery will attend cheaper schools than lottery winners who would have
attended private school even if they lost.

21

E[FM | F0 > m0(θ)] - E[F0 | F0 >m0(θ)]
= {pθE[F1 | F0 > m0(θ), R0=1] + (1 - pθ)E[F0 | F0 > m0(θ), R0=0]} - E[F0 | F0 > m0(θ)].
Note that
E[F0 | F0 > m0(θ)] = pθE[F0 | F0 > m0(θ), R0=1] + (1 - pθ)E[F0 | F0 > m0(θ), R0=0].
Therefore,
E[FM | F0 > m0(θ)] - E[F0 | F0 >m0(θ)] = pθE[F1 - F0 | F0 > m0(θ), R0=1].
Since f0=R0F0, this implies
{E[FM | F0 > m0(θ)] - E[F0 | F0 >m0(θ)}/ pθ = E[f1-f0 | f0> m0(θ)],
which is the quantity we seek to bound. Also, since F1$FM$F0 for all applicants, E[F1 | F1 > m1(θ)] $ E[F1 |
F0 > m0(θ)] $ E[FM | F0 > m0(θ)], and we have
E[F1 | F1 > m1(θ)] - E[F0 | F0 > m0(θ)] $ E[FM | F0 > m0(θ)] - E[F0 | F0 > m0(θ)].
By randomization, E[F1 | F1 > m1(θ)] = E[F| Z=1, F>m1(θ)] and E[F0 | F0 > m0(θ)] = E[F| Z=0, F>m0(θ)] and
pθ = P[R=1| Z=0, F>m0(θ)], which implies (6) and completes the proof.

To see why the upper bound works in the case where θ=0, note that E(FM-F0) is the average difference
between winners’ and losers’ fees due to households who would have attended private schools in any case
trading up to more expensive private schools. This is less than the observed difference in total fee payments
by win/loss status, E(F1-F0). The econometric intuition for this result is that in parametric sample selection
models, controlling for the probability of sample selection eliminates selection bias. Comparing winners and
losers at the same quantiles equalizes the “probability of selection” if F1 = h(F0) for some monotone
increasing transformation, h(). In fact, with no public school fees, the bound is exact when F1 = h(F0). More
generally, dividing by P[R=1| Z=0, F>m0(θ)] corrects for the fact that some of those with positive fees were
attending public school, and the bound applies even without a deterministic link between F0 and F1.
Estimates of (6) are reported in Table 10, along with a lower bound using the biased comparison for
quantiles analogous to (6), i.e., E[F| Z=1,R=1]F>m0(θ)]-E[F| Z=0,R=1]F>m0(θ)]. As noted earlier, this is a
plausible lower bound because of negative selection bias. Note also that any reasonable behavioral model
would predict that a family that spent less than the voucher amount on private school without a voucher would
spend more after the voucher. We therefore focus on bounding effects that are conditional on paying pre-

22

voucher fees equal to at least the voucher amount, roughly $190.
Among losers paying at least $190 in fees, the average fee was $371. Almost all of these pupils were
in private school (in fact, some reports of public school fees above $190 are probably in error; others refer
to a handful of elite public schools that charge significant fees). The lower bound on E[f1-f0| f0>190] is about
$3, but the upper bound is $38. The voucher amount of $190 is the .52 quantile of the fee distribution. Above
this amount, the bounds are tighter. The estimated upper bounds above .6 range from $31 to $48, while the
lower bounds range from $9 to $28. The lower bound estimates are not significantly different from zero at
the 5% level. In some cases, however, the lower bounds are close to a 10% significance level, while the
upper bounds allow for effects on the order of 10% of fee costs and 20% of the voucher value. Thus, it seems
likely that winners in the upper half of the fee distribution spent 5-10% more on private schools than they
otherwise would have. This implies that the marginal propensity to spend voucher income on more expensive
private schools was non-trivial, counter to a simple model of human capital investment without credit
constraints.

Price discrimination by private schools
Another potential source of increased expenditure on fees by winners is price discrimination. There
is little evidence that private schools discriminated by charging more to applicants with PACES scholarships.
The easiest way for schools to price discriminate was to offer scholarships to those less likely to be able to
afford education at the full price, i.e., applicants without PACES vouchers. In practice, however, we found
little evidence of price discrimination. Our survey indicates that roughly 6% of losers in private school
received a school scholarship, while 3% of winners in private school received a school scholarship. This is
a small and insignificant difference. Per lottery winner, i.e., without conditioning on attending private school,
the difference is only about 1%.

23

B. Impact on the Government Budget
The PACES program was established in part to expand secondary school enrollment without using
the public system. We estimate that the program increased public educational expenditure by about $24 per
lottery winner, relative to the cost of accommodating these pupils in public school. As discussed in Section
III, winners were no more likely than losers to attend school, but the program probably did expand overall
school enrollment by freeing up places in public schools as lottery winners transferred to private schools.
To see where the $24 figure comes from, note that the probability of attending public school, reported
in Table 9, fell by 0.14 for lottery winners. The average per-pupil cost of a secondary school slot was about
$350, excluding implicit rental for school facilities. In the short run, the marginal cost of public school slots
may differ from the average cost, but in the long run, it seems reasonable to assume marginal and average
costs will be similar. Assuming the marginal cost of providing public school places equals the average cost,
adding school spaces through PACES reduced long-run expenditure on public schools by 14% of $350 or
roughly $50 per winner, so the extra public educational expenditure per lottery winner is about $74 (to pupils)
- $50 (in reduced public school costs) = $24. Moreover, allowing the marginal cost to differ from average
cost by $100 either way still leads to voucher program costs in the 10-40 dollar range.

C. Overall Cost and Benefits
The extra society-wide educational resource cost per lottery winner differs from the roughly $24 of
extra public education expenditure, since households used part of the voucher funds to offset education costs
they would have incurred privately, and households lost income from their children’s work. The average
lottery winner received $74 more than the average loser in scholarship assistance, but spent only $52 more
on gross school fees. Lottery winners earned $41 less than losers through work. Winning households’ net
resource contribution was therefore $52 (additional school fees) + $41 (reduced earnings) - $74 (voucher)
= $19. This implies that the society-wide additional educational resource cost per lottery winner was
approximately $24 (government) + $19 (households) = $43.

24

The comparison of costs and benefits should take account of the fact that three years of costs were
incurred prior to our survey. The total cost of the program can therefore be estimated by multiplying the
annual resource cost times the roughly 3 years winners received vouchers, for a total of about 3×24 = $72 in
additional public educational expenditure and 3×$43=$129 in total societal resource cost. Actual costs are
probably somewhat higher, however, since voucher take-up rates declined over time, with 88% of winners
having ever used a voucher, and only 49% using it in the survey year. Multiplying costs by 88%/49% for the
first and second years yields an upper bound on the three-year cost of the program of about $195 using the
$43/year figure for social costs.
These costs are very likely small relative to the benefits for participants. Although lottery winners
gave up current earnings, they completed an additional .12-.16 grades and scored approximately .2 standard
deviations higher on tests. Among US Hispanic students who took the same test, the difference in test scores
between 7th and 8th graders, or between 8th and 9th graders, was also about .2 standard deviations, so the
achievement gain from winning the lottery may be as large as that associated with a full year of schooling.
Our estimates using a recent Colombian labor force survey show returns to schooling of about 10%. If the
gain from the program is only the economic return to an additional 0.12 years of schooling, the program raised
winners’ wages by 1.2% per year, whereas if it is equal to that from a full year of schooling it raised wages
by 10%. Annual earnings of parents in our sample were about $2,400 per worker, and PACES applicants
should be able to earn more, since the average parent had only 5.9 years of education while the average
applicant had already completed 7.5 years and was still in school at the time of our survey. We therefore
assume the expected earnings of applicants are $3000. Thus, PACES seems very likely to raise lottery
winners’ wages by $36 per year, and might raise wages by as much as $300 per year if higher test scores have
a grade-equivalent payoff. Discounted over applicants working lives, these benefits easily outweigh the social
costs of the voucher program, which are probably no more than $195.
A more complete cost-benefit analysis would take into account the program’s effects on nonparticipants. Pupils left behind in public schools may have been hurt by the departure of motivated classmates

25

for private schools, or alternatively, public schools may have responded positively to increased competition,
a possibility considered by Hoxby (2000) and Bettinger (2001b). Such general equilibrium effects cannot be
assessed by comparing lottery winners and losers. But since the partial equilibrium cost-benefit analysis is
clear-cut, and since only 15% of winners moved from public to private schools, any negative external effects
on non-participants would have to have been extraordinarily large to outweigh program benefits.

VII. Summary and Conclusions
Colombia’s PACES program provides an unusual opportunity to assess the effect of demand-side
education financing in a Latin American country where private schools educate a substantial fraction of
pupils. The PACES program is of special interest because many vouchers were assigned by lottery, so
program effects can be reliably assessed. Our results suggest that lottery winners benefitted from higher
educational attainment, primarily as a consequence of reduced grade repetition, as well as from higher test
scores and a lower probability of teen cohabitation or employment. Most of the results suggest PACES
vouchers had a stronger effect on the education of girls than on the education of boys.
PACES vouchers affected outcomes through a number of channels. First, lottery winners were more
likely to have attended participating private schools, and these schools may be better than public schools.
Moreover, because voucher recipients who failed a grade risked losing vouchers, lottery winners had an
incentive to devote more effort to school. Finally, vouchers may have allowed some households who would
have chosen private schools in any case to attend more expensive private schools. The net effect is such that
the benefit of voucher awards were more than enough to offset the costs. In work in progress, we are
assessing longer term consequences of voucher receipt, and hope to be able to document effects on secondary
school completion rates. An implication of our findings to date is that demand-side programs like PACES
can be a cost-effective way to increase educational attainment and academic achievement, at least in countries
like Colombia with a weak public school infrastructure and a well-developed private education sector.

DATA APPENDIX
1. Surveys
The sampling frame for the surveys were the lists of PACES winners and losers obtained from
ICETEX offices. We selected applicants at random from these lists. Those with phones were interviewed
first. Applicants were called up to 9 times total and 3 times/day to obtain an interview, with numbers of
contacts similar for winners and losers. In general, we interviewed parents or guardians and not the applicants
themselves. Some interviewing was conducted in person; household interviews are distinguished by the
inclusion of a dummy in the estimation. We developed a pilot survey that was used to test questions and
interviewing strategies. The pilot survey ultimately differed little from the main survey so pilot responses are
included in the data set analyzed here and indicated by a survey-form dummy included in the analyses.
Interviewers were college students attending Javierna University De Colombia, in Bogota. The
interviewers were selected and trained by one of us (Bloom). Responsibility for interviewing later passed to
two of the most experienced interviewers. Surveys were checked and coded by the interviewers, but
interviewers did not code their own interviews. Responses were also checked by a research assistant in
Boston. We tried to blind interviewers to the win/loss status of respondents for as long as possible, and had
each interviewer collect data from applicants in both groups.

2. Testing
There were four test dates. On the first, we tested applicants from Suba; on the second, we tested
Suba no-shows; on the third date, we tested applicants from La Candelaria and downtown areas nearby.
Finally, on the last date we tested third-date no-shows, plus applicants from the Ciudad Bolivar neighborhood
and surrounding areas.
Sample sizes and response rates were as follows. 473 applicants were invited for testing, 283 (60%)
were tested. Response rates at individual test sites were as follows: 77 Suba applicants were invited, 50
(65%) were tested on dates 1 or 2, one subject did not do the math test; 109 Candalaria applicants were

27

invited, 83 (76%) were tested on dates 3 or 4; 287 Ciudad Bolivar applicants were invited and one showed
up uninvited, 150 (52%) were tested on date 4. Response rates were higher at the first two sites because noshows had more than one opportunity to be tested. Test score means and pupil characteristics were similar
across sites. Site-specific treatment effects were not significantly different from zero.
Scores are reported in the tables as the standardized (mean zero, standard deviation 1) number right.
The standardization uses means and standard deviations in sample of test takers. The appendix table presents
a comparison of our test scores with those for the La Prueba norming population.

Notes: Results are from models that control for city, year of application, whether applicant had access to a phone,
age, type of survey and instrument, strata of residence, and month of interview. The outcome “Finished 8th” in
the combined sample does not include applicants to the Bogota 1997 voucher lottery. In the outcome “Test
Scores – Total Points,” the sample is restricted to those individuals who took the exam. In the 2sls specification,
the endogenous regressor used scholarship is instrumented with a voucher win/loss dummy.

Notes: Standard deviations are reported in parentheses in columns 1 and 4. Robust standard errors are
reported in parentheses in all other columns. Sample sizes differ from other tables because of missing
fee data. The sample sizes differ slightly across rows because of missing data for “Currently Using
Scholarship from the Private School” and the outcomes with the more comprehensive fee measure.
The regression estimates in columns 3 and 6 are from models that include controls for whether
applicant has phone, age, type of survey and instrument, strata of residence, and month of interview.

Notes: Estimates are for Bogota 1995 applicants only. Bounds are conditional on fee payments
exceeding the indicated dollar cutoffs. Standard deviations are reported in parentheses in columns 2-4.
Standard errors are reported in parentheses in columns 5 and 6. The upper bound above a given
percentile is computed in a two-step process. First, we estimate the difference between winners’ and
losers’ matriculation fees conditional on being greater than the given quantile in their respective
distributions. Second, we divide this difference by the probability that losers above the given
percentile attend private school. The lower is computed by taking the differences between winners’
and losers’ fees conditional on private school attendance and conditional on being greater than the
cutoff. See text and appendix for further details.
