ABSTRACT
Will fast growing emerging economies sustain rapid growth rates until they “catch-up” to the technology
frontier? Are there incentives for some developed countries to free-ride off of innovators and optimally
“fallback” relative to the frontier? This paper models agents growing as a result of investments in innovation
and imitation. Imitation facilitates technology diffusion, with the productivity of imitation modeled
by a catch-up function that increases with distance to the frontier. The resulting equilibrium is an endogenous
segmentation between innovators and imitators, where imitating agents optimally choose to “catch-up”
or “fall-back” to a productivity ratio below the frontier.

Introduction

During the last decade, a number of newly industrialized countries, most prominently Russia, India, and
China, have exhibited rapid sustained growth, often at rates of 5 to 10 percent annually. While part of
this growth is attributable to factor accumulation, innovation, and rising revenues from natural resources,
the unusually fast pace is also due to the diffusion of technology from more advanced countries that has
been termed “catch-up.” Will these countries continue to grow quickly until they catch-up to the technology
frontier and then grow through innovation, or will growth slow down while these countries are significantly
behind the frontier where they can better exploit externalities from technology diffusion?
Emerging economies are not the only countries that have experienced catch-up. Many European countries
grew faster than the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. However, early in the 1990s their GDP per
capita relative to the U.S. began to stabilize at a value significantly below unity, perhaps providing evidence
for the future path of these rapidly growing low income countries.
Additionally, over the previous two decades a number of upper-middle income developed countries like
Portugal and Italy have been growing at rates slower than innovating countries at the technology frontier
like the United States. Are they falling behind despite their best efforts to keep up with the leader, or are
there free-rider incentives to let others innovate and push out the frontier that might make falling behind
optimal? If the intensity of technology diffusion is endogenous, might some middle-income countries choose
to “fall-back” in their relative technology level in order to consume more and grow through the diffusion of
new innovations from the frontier?1
Empirical explorations of the early Nelson and Phelps (1966) model based on the theory of technological
catch-up (Gerschenkron (1962), Lucas (2009)) suggest that the rate of productivity growth depends on the
distance to the technology frontier, modulated by factors like human capital (Benhabib and Spiegel (1994,
2005)) or political constraints and inertia (Parente and Prescott (1994)). Despite presenting compelling
empirical findings on the role of technology diffusion in explaining growth, these early papers do not explicitly
model economic variables that affect the rate of diffusion as subject to economic choice. Levels of human
capital or the political institutions, even if measured, are taken as exogenous. Some of the later literature,
for example Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1997), endogenize the investment expenditures in “imitation,” but
typically differentiate between leaders, with exogenously specified low innovation costs, and followers, with
high innovation but low imitation costs. A related approach is to endogenize the decision to undertake
research expenditures that increase the probability of adopting the leader’s technology. For example, in
Aghion, Howitt, and Mayer-Foulkes (2005) countries differ in their profitability as well as their research
costs: some find it profitable to engage in investments to optimize their probability of technology adoption,
while others with high costs or low profitability may choose zero investments in adoption and keep falling
behind.2,3
The main contribution of our paper is a stylized model in which agents optimally choose the amount to
invest in improving growth through innovation as well as through technology adoption. We examine how the
efficiency of technology diffusion determines whether agents will ultimately catch-up to the frontier, catch1 Chapter 5 of the World Bank Golden Growth publication (Gill and Raiser (2012)) focuses on “Europe’s innovation deficit,”
discussing the American “innovation machine” and the European “convergence machine.” Some of the main questions in this
publication are “whether Europe has fundamental flaws in its economic environment that make its innovation deficit a fact of
life” and “what should European governments do to increase innovation?” From the perspective of this theory, imitation and
fall-back may be an optimal outcome. This force is discussed in the context of the “benefits to backwardness” in Klenow and
Rodriguez-Clare (2005).
2 For an exposition see Aghion and Howitt (2009), pp. 152–158.
3 Acemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti (2006) introduce a model where high skill entrepreneurs can enhance productivity growth
through innovation but not through technology adoption. When the distance to the frontier is large, firms may retain a lowskill entrepreneur but replace the entrepreneur at some cost when the distance closes and innovation becomes important. This
introduces productivity growth that depends on the distance to the frontier. In our model, we allow the agents to optimally
choose any level of investment in innovation as well as in technology adoption, rather than having firms make discrete decisions
on the retention of low skill entrepreneurs. In both models, productivity growth and optimal actions depend on the distance to
the frontier.

up part of the way to the frontier and then slow down, fall-back and continue to grow through technology
diffusion, or conduct autarkic innovation with no contribution from technology diffusion.
Agents in our model are identical except for their initial productivity levels: they do not differ in their
costs of investment, production or adoption technologies, or preferences. All agents can affect the rate
at which their productivity deterministically grows with expenditures that facilitate technology adoption
or innovation at some consumption cost, and they do so optimally. The optimal choice for an agent is a
portfolio of imitation and innovation investments, both of which affect the rate at which their productivity
grows depending on the relative return of each investment. Innovation is a simple technology with constant
marginal productivity that does not benefit from externalities. As imitation facilitates technology diffusion
from an agent at the frontier, the productivity of imitation will depend on characteristics of both the agent
itself and the agent it is imitating.4 This relationship is modeled with a catch-up function that determines
the amount of technology diffusion that occurs for a marginal investment in imitation.
This catch-up function for technology diffusion nests some the standard diffusion models, including the
logistic, the Gompertz, and the Nelson-Phelps (confined exponential). In this framework technology adoption
is gradual. The rate of growth of productivity due to imitation depends on investments that facilitate
technology diffusion as well as on a measure of the ease of adopting existing superior technologies—the
distance to the technology frontier.5,6
Engaging in imitation has a trade-off: the agent gains the advantage of higher productivity as they
exploit the diffusion externality, but if they move closer to the frontier, diffusion becomes less efficient and
more investment is necessary to maintain their productivity relative to the frontier. These competing forces
can eventually balance, where an agent chooses an equilibrium productivity that is permanently below the
technology frontier. Moreover, if agents have high relative productivity but the returns to innovation are
insufficient, they may choose to endogenously fall-back to a lower relative productivity level to gain the
advantage of more efficient technology diffusion. Very low productivity agents, on the other hand, may
invest to increase their productivity until the trade-offs are in balance.
We find that there is a threshold such that all agents with a ratio of their productivity to the technology
frontier above this threshold choose to invest only in innovation. All agents whose ratio of productivity to
the frontier is below the threshold entirely focus investment expenditures on facilitating technology diffusion.
The threshold will depend on the return of innovation relative to imitation for the agents, where the catch-up
function determines the rate of technology flow for a unit investment in imitation.
We define a balanced growth path (BGP) as a path where the productivities of all agents grow at the same
rate. Starting from an arbitrary initial distribution, we study the long run distribution of productivities on
the BGP, its dependence on fundamental cost and efficiency parameters, and the uniqueness and stability of
this equilibrium. We explore how the productivity distribution becomes segmented between those who pursue
imitation and those who specialize in innovation. All innovators grow at the same rate, and therefore the ratio
4 The literature on technology and knowledge spillovers also explores a similar trade-off between an agent’s own investment in
R&D and exploiting externalities by investing in imitating the innovations of more productive firms. In Eeckhout and Jovanovic
(2002), the total factor productivity of an agent depends on both its own capital and that of all better firms in the economy.
Kortum (1997) instead has agents investing in a stochastic research technology, where the efficiency of new technologies depends
on a spillover from the entire stock of existing research.
5 Technologies to produce goods could consist of various processes, not all of which are instantly adopted. For example,
production may start with an assembly plant and the manufacturing of parts. Associated processes may be gradually adopted
as know-how develops and accumulates. In 1977, on visiting a Samsung research lab in Korea, Ira Magaziner wrote: “[It]
reminded me of a dilapidated high-school science room. . .They’d gathered color televisions from every major company in the
world—RCA, GE, Hitachi—and were using them to design a model of their own.” See Magaziner and Patinkin (1990), pp. 24.
6 Jones (2005) explores idea based models of growth and the role of non-rivalrous inputs in generating endogenous growth.
In our model, innovating agents have non-rivalrous productivity but are given no legal method to profit from imitation and
face no negative effects from being copied. Moreover, technology diffusion is slow, copying modest improvements of the frontier
sequentially as described in footnote 5. This is in contrast to models of directed imitation at lower levels of aggregation, where
agents make a rapid jump to the frontier by copying the most productive individual firms. In general, patent systems typically
require active monitoring and expensive litigation that are only optimal for cutting-edge products with high rents. Last, our
model exhibits no scale effects due to the structure of the catch-up function.

of their productivity to the technology frontier remains unchanged. In the limit, the ratio of every imitator’s
productivity to the technology frontier converges to a common constant that lies below the threshold. All
imitators grow at the same rate as the frontier technology with growth only driven by technology diffusion.
Imitators do not necessarily disappear in the limit, nor is there universal convergence to the frontier. However,
if investment in productivity growth is significantly more efficient through innovation than through adoption,
the threshold ratio above which agents only invest in innovation may be zero. Similarly, if the technology for
diffusion is sufficiently inefficient, agents who optimally specialize their expenditures on technology diffusion
are nevertheless left progressively behind, so that their productivity ratio to the technology frontier converges
towards zero. Last, we find that a uniform increase in the productivity of both innovation and imitation will
not distort the proportion of agents conducting innovation, but will change the equilibrium productivity of
imitating agents.
An alternative approach to technology diffusion is to consider how agents might adopt the technology
of agents spread throughout the productivity distribution, on average adopting technologies much closer
to the mean productivity than the frontier. The recent works of Lucas and Moll (2012) and Perla and
Tonetti (2011) endogenize technology adoption as an optimal search decision made by firms taking draws
from the distribution of existing technologies. They then study the endogenous evolution of the productivity
distribution that results from this search process, without giving agents access to an innovation technology.
Both Lucas and Moll (2012) and Perla and Tonetti (2011) work within a stochastic search framework where
searching agents copy the technology of a random agent in the economy and immediately make a discrete jump
to the new productivity level. Imitation here is more in the spirit of Benhabib and Spiegel (1994, 2005).
Another approach, taken by Luttmer (2011), studies how imitation by new entrants can drive aggregate
growth, with the productivity of incumbents evolving according to an exogenous stochastic process as opposed
to a controlled innovation decision. In our framework we are able to focus on the portfolio choice of allocating
expenditures between imitation and innovation and on the endogenous evolution of the frontier, allowing the
key economic incentives for catch-up and fall-back through innovation and imitation to be clearly illuminated.

2

The Model

Agents are heterogeneous over their productivity level, z, and choose to invest in improving productivity
through imitation and innovation. The cost of generating productivity growth through imitation (or technology adoption) is sz and the cost of generating productivity growth through innovation is γz. The parameters
σ > 0, c > 0 measure the efficiency of innovation and technology adoption expenditures, r is the discount
rate, and utility is logarithmic. Output is given by Bz, B > 0. The initial distribution of productivities is
Φ̃ (0, z), with min support > 0 and max support ≡ F (0) > 0. The distribution of productivities at time t
is Φ̃(t, z) on (0, F (t)], where F (t) is the frontier. It is often convenient to work in productivities as ratios
7
compared to the frontier: x(t) ≡ Fz(t)
(t) . In that case, the distribution of x is Φ(t, x) defined on (0, 1]. This
distribution fully characterizes the aggregate state of the economy.
Catch-up Technology The efficiency of expenditure on imitation depends on the distance of the imitating
agent to the technology frontier. Our catch-up function (or technology adoption function) parametrically
specifies how technology adoption expenditures affect productivity growth as a function of distance to the
technology frontier. Our specification nests the logistic and Nelson-Phelps technology diffusion processes
and is flexible enough to allow for the flow of technology diffusion to decrease, for a fixed investment, as the
distance to the frontier increases. Since the catch-up function only depends on distance to the frontier and

space.

no other statistics of the productivity distribution, the evolution of each initial productivity relative to the
frontier can be studied independently.8
All agents choose their expenditures in innovation and in technology adoption optimally, both of which
promote the rate of productivity growth. Spending γz on innovation produces growth of z at rate γσ. For an
investment of sz in imitation, the agent produces growth of z at a rate sD̃(t, z). Given parameters controlling
the rate of technology diffusion, c and m, the catch-up function for technology growth at time t is given by

where expenditures s ≥ 0 and m ∈ (−∞, ∞). Since the catch-up function specifies the marginal return to
an investment in imitation it critically affects agents dynamic behavior. Setting m = 1 gives the familiar
logistic diffusion, while m = −1 gives the Nelson-Phelps (confined exponential) diffusion.9 Letting m → 0
yields, after using L’Hopital’s rule, the Gompertz diffusion model:

Note that D̃ (t, F (t); m) = 0 for all t, m. Hence, the returns to imitation for the frontier agent are always
0.
The General Optimization Problem Our model allows for the endogenous growth of heterogeneous
agents: productivity growth depends linearly on optimally chosen expenditures on innovation and adoption,
γ and s. The benefits of innovation and diffusion, γσ and sD̃ (t, z; m), and their respective costs, γ(t)z(t)
and s(t)z(t), are flow variables in continuous time. Consumption is Bz(t) − s(t)z(t) − γ(t)z(t). Given an
initial idiosyncratic productivity level, z(0), and an initial productivity distribution across agents, Φ̃(0, z),
all agents solve the same problem:

The first order necessary conditions of this Hamiltonian are augmented with complementarity conditions to
ensure s ≥ 0 and γ ≥ 0. H is concave in s, γ, but the full second order conditions are addressed in Section
8 Using the frontier (the maximum statistic) to summarize the distribution provides a great deal of analytical tractability.
Perla and Tonetti (2011) and Lucas and Moll (2012) use random search models to focus on the feedback relationship between the
entire endogenously determined productivity distribution and optimal technology adoption decisions. Alvarez, Buera, and Lucas
(2011) combine a similar random search structure with a model of trade to explicitly micro-found technology diffusion across
countries. These papers do not feature an innovation technology or an endogenously evolving technology frontier. Dependence
only on the frontier can be thought of as directed search with no differential search costs. The effect of directed investment in
imitation, with imitation costs increasing as the distance to the imitated grows, is left for future research.

Frontier

Because the imitation policies of all agents not at the frontier depend on the behavior of the frontier, the
frontier agent’s problem must be solved first. Since improving productivity through imitation is not possible
at the frontier, the leader sets s = 0. The problem for the leader then simplifies to

Followers

For z(t) < F (t), the returns to imitation are strictly positive. Since the productivity of imitation depends on
the distance to the frontier, followers take into account that the frontier grows at a constant rate g = Bσ − r.
The following results are derived for the m 6= 0 case. As is discussed in footnote 14, the solution is continuous
for the Gompertz case at m = 0.
Before solving the follower’s problem, it is useful to transform the problem with a change of variables.
Optimization Problem in x

A major advantage of this form of catch-up function is that since it only

depends on the ratio of an agent’s productivity to the frontier, the optimization problem becomes time
invariant given a simple change of variables. Using the ratio of productivity to the frontier
x(t) ≡

z(t)
F (t)

The Lagrange multiplier on the law of motion in x is λ. As previously mentioned, this problem is now

Marginal Productivity of Innovation and Imitation Since equation 20.a is linear in both s and
γ, the marginal productivity for an investment in either s or γ is constant. That is, an investment in γ
has a marginal productivity of innovation σ. Given a fixed value of x, an investment in s has a marginal
productivity of imitation D(x). Since ∂D(x;m)
< 0, the marginal productivity of imitation decreases with x.
∂x
Because the efficiency of technology adoption depends on the distance to the frontier, forward looking agents
will consider the negative effect on the marginal productivity of imitation from increasing x.

It can be seen from the the first-order conditions in equations 26 and 28 that an agent considers the marginal
productivity of innovation or imitation when optimizing its investment portfolio, where λ is the shadow price
of x.
To solve for the equilibrium, it is useful to define a new variable: µ(t) ≡ λ(t)x(t) =⇒ µ̇(t) = λ̇x + λẋ. µ(t)
is the agent’s valuation of its state x(t) at shadow price λ(t). Let ¯· denote steady state values (e.g. s̄ and
x̄). The Euler equation (equation 25) can be rewritten as
λ̇x = −1 − λẋ + λxcsxm + λxr

Solution to Followers Problem

The followers problem can be solved by analyzing all cases of the complementarity conditions for s and γ.
4.2.1

Simultaneous Innovation and Imitation

For the case where agents do both innovation and imitation, s > 0 and γ > 0. This can only happen at a
unique x∗ , which separates regions of innovation and imitation. For both s and γ to be interior, the first
order conditions, equations 27 and 28, must be equal.

(32)

(33)

Hence, an agent is indifferent between innovating and imitating at a time-invariant knife edge productivity
ratio, x∗ , which is strictly between zero and one for all m 6= 0 given the following assumption.
Assumption 2:

σm
c

<1

x∗ ∈ (0, 1) means that there are both followers that prefer to innovate and followers that prefer to imitate.
Assumption 2 guarantees this by ensuring that the productivity of innovation is not too large compared
to the productivity of imitation and that the productivity of imitation is not too large compared to the
productivity of innovation, since these forces are modulated by σ, m, and c. At any x other than x∗ both
equation 27 and equation 28 cannot hold with equality simultaneously, and therefore both s and γ cannot
be simultaneously strictly positive except at x∗ .11
When making the portfolio choice on the extensive margin, equation 32 shows that the agent only needs
to compare the instantaneous marginal productivity of innovation to the marginal productivity of imitation.
In particular, the change in the marginal product of imitation as x changes, D′ (x), does not affect the agent’s
decision.
Lemma 1. Given Assumptions 1 and 2, there exists an interior time-invariant x∗ such that:

(35)

=⇒ s(x) = 0, γ(x) > 0

(36)

Proof. Section 4.2.1 has shown that both s > 0 and γ > 0 can only occur at a single x. From the FOCs, for
c
innovation to be preferred over imitation, it must be that σ > m
(1 − xm ), which is satisfied by all x > x∗
for both positive and negative m. The imitation region follows directly. The fact that γ is strictly positive
in the innovation region is proved in Section 4.2.2.12
When the marginal productivity of innovation is high enough to violate Assumption 2, it is possible for
∗

x to be = 0, and no imitation will take place, as can be seen from equation 34. As long as Assumption
2 is satisfied, no matter how high the marginal productivity of imitation, there is always a region where
innovation is optimal.

In the region x > x∗ only innovation will occur, as stated in Lemma 1.
11 If mσ > 1 then x∗ = 0 and there is no imitation region. In this case, all agents choose to innovate at the same rate, as is

Given the solution for the frontier, g = Bσ − r, this proves that xẋ = 0. All agents in this region grow at
the same rate as the frontier by choosing the same level of investment in innovation. Since ẋx = 0 and x∗ is
time-invariant, it is verified that an agent in x > x∗ chooses γ > 0 and will never enter the x < x∗ region.
To verify transversality, note that since an agent will never change regions, s = 0 for all t for x > x∗ .

Imitation Only: x < x∗

In the region x < x∗ , only imitation will occur, as stated in Lemma 1.
To solve for the policy functions of agents in this region it is useful to perform another change of variables,
where the relative distance of the agent to the frontier is distorted by the diffusion parameter m: q(t) ≡ x(t)m .
Using the chain rule:

Equations 41, 42, and 43 form a system in the variables µ, q, s. Eliminating µ via substitution will create a
2x2 system. First, differentiating equation 42
µ̇ =

c(1 − q)2 (B − s)2

ṡ =

(B − s) ((−1 + q)(−Bc + mr + cs + cq(B + (−1 + m)s)) + mq̇)
m(−1 + q)

In Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 we show that the unique stationary point (x̄, s̄) is stable. Therefore
paths that converge to (x̄, s̄) automatically satisfy the transversality condition. Substituting these values

It remains to show that the agent’s optimization problem satisfies the second order sufficiency conditions. It is sufficient to prove the concavity of the maximized Hamiltonian with respect to x (see Seierstad
and Sydsaeter (1977) Theorems 3 and 10). The following parameter restrictions are sufficient to satisfy the
second order conditions. See Appendix B for details.14
Assumption 3: m ≥ −1 and

c

<m+2

Note that both conditions in Assumption 3 restrict the efficiency of technology diffusion. Concavity may be
lost as technology diffusion becomes too easy, with high c or low m.
Summary Lemma 1 summarizes the threshold productivity ratio, x∗ , that separates agents into innovators
and imitators. As proven in Section 4.2.2, for x > x∗ all agents choose to innovate at the same rate and
grow at the same rate. As proven in Section 4.2.3, for x < x∗ all agents exclusively imitate, and stability
of the system Ψ(s(t), q(t)) implies that there exists a unique steady state productivity ratio, x̄, to which all
imitating agents converge. Agents below x̄ invest in imitation to take advantage of the high efficiency of
technology diffusion and catch up to x̄. Agents below x∗ but above x̄ endogenously choose to fall back to x̄
to reach the optimal trade-off between consumption and investment in imitation, dictated by the strength

The Dynamic Solution

Proposition 1 states the main result of the paper: the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the stationary
solution.
Proposition 1. Let Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold, then for arbitrary Φ(0, x)
1/m
A: There exists a threshold ratio x∗ = 1 − mσ
such that all agents with x > x∗ , including the leader,
c
r
do only research. They set s = 0, γ = B − σ > 0, and grow at the rate σB − r. For x > x∗ , the distribution
Φ(t, x) = Φ(0, x) for all t.
B: All agents with initial conditions x < x∗ invest only in technology adoption with s(t) ≥ 0 and γ(t) = 0.
There exists a strictly positive BGP productivity ratio 0 < x̄ < x∗ such that all initial productivity ratios
x < x∗ converge to x̄.
Proof. See the cases in Section 4 and the conditions in Appendix A.
If we denote the cases where m > 0 as logistic diffusions and the cases where m < 0 as Nelson-Phelps
diffusions, Figure 1 illustrates system dynamics and Proposition 1 for several values of σ and D(x; m). The
stylized arrows show how convergence might look towards steady state values for x. As can be seen in
the lower part of the graph, when the marginal productivity of innovation is greater than the marginal
productivity of imitation, the agent chooses to invest entirely in γ.16
Proposition 2 characterizes the asymptotic dynamics of the distribution of productivities.
Proposition 2. A balanced growth path equilibrium is a growth rate g = σB − r, a steady state imitator
productivity ratio x̄, an innovator threshold x∗ , and an asymptotic distribution Φ(∞, x) such that

Any initial distribution Φ(0, x) will converge to this unique balanced growth path. In particular, all initial
distributions that agree over support x > x∗ will converge to the same BGP, since all agents initially below
x∗ converge to x̄.
This proposition is illustrated in Figure 2 for an arbitrary initial distribution Φ(0, x) and the unique
BGP distribution Φ(∞, x). The dynamics and asymptotic distribution are independent of the initial frontier
15 There is no mixing in the evolution technology, in that the relative productivity rankings of agents is constant for all
time. Additionally, innovators never become imitators and imitators never become innovators. This is because the model is
deterministic and investments gradually improve growth rates as opposed to facilitating discrete advances in productivity levels.
Shocks to productivity would introduce leapfrogging and switches between innovation and imitation.
16 For some numerical examples that fulfill Assumptions 1, 2, and 3:

One of the main findings of Benhabib and Spiegel (2005) was that in the logistic case, if their distance to
the frontier is too large, “the follower will not be able to keep up, growth rates will diverge, and the income
ratio of the follower to the leader will go to zero.” This is because there exists a range of productivities
such that the flow of technology diffusion for a given investment in imitation is decreasing in the distance
to the frontier. Once the imitation expenditure is endogenized this finding is reversed, as agents invest in
technology diffusion such that they converge to a positive BGP productivity ratio, x̄, and grow at the same
rate as the leader.

Catch-up, Fall-back, and the Shadow Value of x(t)

The Euler equation characterizes the dynamic trade-offs an agent faces. Joint analysis of the Euler equation
and the shadow price and shadow value of x provides intuition for the determinants of equilibrium and the
forces that lead to the BGP.
From the Euler equation in 23,

r=

λ̇ 1
+ + (σγ + sD(x) − g) + sxD′ (x)
λ x

(57)

As usual, the Euler equation states that at each point in time the total benefit of a marginal unit of x,
represented by sum of the terms on the right, must equal the discount rate. The term λλ̇ is the appreciation
in the shadow price of x while x1 is marginal utility of x. The terms (σγ + sD(x) − g) represent the marginal
product of x, both through innovation and through technology diffusion. The final term, sxD′ (x), tempers the
marginal product of x because a higher x reduces the distance to the frontier and therefore the productivity
of future imitation. To see this, note that in our model D′ (x) < 0. The agents optimally choose s to
determine the rate at which they catch-up, or alternatively fall-back. Hence the strength of catch-up or fallback depends on the magnitude of sxD′ (x) with D′ (x) exerting a negative force on catch-up or, equivalently,
a positive force for fall-back. If however the agent optimally sets s = 0, then D′ (x) has no direct effect on
the change.
Recall µ(t) can be interpreted as the agent’s valuation of its state x(t) at shadow prices λ(t). The Euler
equation at steady state can be arranged as

(58)
(59)

Equations 58 and 59 show the role of s̄x̄D′ (x̄) on imitation and innovation in equilibrium. In a region
of innovation where s̄ = 0 the discounted value of the utility flow for a marginal unit of x̄ per period is
the marginal utility x̄1 discounted by r. In fact, in the innovation region where s = 0, logarithmic utility
implies that everywhere along the optimal path the marginal utility of an additional unit of x is x1 while its
marginal product is constant. This yields the value of the stock x(t) evaluated at the shadow price λ(t) as
1
µ(t) = λ(t)x(t) = 1r , and λ(t) = 1r x(t)
. In the imitation region where s > 0 the marginal product of x is no
longer constant because, as discussed earlier, D(x) is not constant and D′ (x) < 0. An increase in the BGP x̄

brings the agent closer to the frontier and diminishes the marginal productivity of imitation. This is reflected
by the term s̄x̄D′ (x̄) < 0 which augments the effective discount rate that must be applied to the flow of
utility. At the BGP productivity ratio in the imitation region the effective discount rate is r − s̄x̄D′ (x̄) > r
(see equation 58). This captures the negative impact of higher productivity on the endogenously chosen flow
of diffusion. This is the active force in the region of imitation below the innovator threshold x∗ that causes
agents close to the threshold to choose to fall-back to x̄. These agents let their relative productivity slip in
order to benefit from a higher flow of technology diffusion.

Comparative Dynamics

Propositions 1 and 2 document that the unique BGP can be characterized by g, x∗ , and x̄, but how do these
equilibrium values depend on fundamental parameters? This section studies how the balanced growth path
equilibrium changes as parameters modulating the productivity of investment—σ, m, and c—are varied.

16

6.1

Comparative Dynamics for Hicks-Neutral Technical Change

The ratio θ ≡

σ
c

is a measure of the relative productivity of innovation to imitation and is an important

determinant of the equilibrium. As can be seen by rewriting equation 34,
x∗ = (1 − mθ)

1/m

(60)

the threshold for imitation versus innovation depends on the ratio θ rather than on the levels of σ and c
independently. This is because x∗ is determined by the ratio of instantaneous marginal productivities that
are linear in σ and c, as captured in equation 32. This is analogous to the optimal capital to labor ratio
in a neoclassical growth model, where a Hicks-neutral technology shock does not alter the optimal relative
expenditures. Here, changes in σ and c that keep θ constant may act like a Hicks-neutral technical change,
since they keep this measure of relative productivity constant.
However, equation 54 shows the lack of neutrality on x̄.

The direct dependence of x̄ on c comes from the fall-back incentive. Since

∂ 2 D(x;c)
∂x∂c

(61)

< 0, as c increases,

′

the strength of the fall-back incentive, D (x; c), increases. Hence, a seemingly Hicks-neutral increase in the
productivity of growth technologies can change the equilibrium outcome. To see this, fix the ratio θ̄ = σ̄c̄
and multiply these by a total factor productivity term, A: σ = Aσ̄ and c = Ac̄.

A seemingly Hicks-neutral change in the technology level of the economy has no effect on x∗ , but by
increasing the strength of the fall-back incentive the change is not neutral in its effect on x̄. Even though the
growth technology has improved, the growth rate B σ̄A − r increases with A, so imitators have to increase
investment in imitation, s̄, to keep up with the higher growth rate. The optimal response is to increase
investment some to keep up, but, in response to a better imitation technology, to fall back a bit and benefit
from the more efficient flow.
To see how the economy responds to ever increasing TFP in growth technologies take the limit of A → ∞.
Clearly x∗ is unchanged. For x̄, the terms with a c in equation 61 go to zero. Hence,

Thus x̄ decreases as TFP grows, but stays strictly above 0. This result is in contrast to the comparative
dynamics of taking c to ∞, where both x∗ and x̄ converge to 1, as discussed in Section 6.4.

Comparative Dynamics of m

m is a key parameter that affects the efficiency of technology diffusion and distorts imitation incentives
depending on the distance to the frontier.
As discussed in Section 4.2.1, the decision of agents to imitate or innovate, summarized by x∗ , depends
only on the instantaneous marginal productivity of innovation and imitation (i.e., D(x; m) vs. σ). A change
in m alters the incentives for agents to choose to imitate, as an increase in m decreases the efficiency of

As imitation becomes less productive, or equivalently as technology diffusion becomes less efficient, more
agents will choose to be innovators and there will be less imitators. This is captured in Proposition 4.

threshold decreases. That is

is, as technology diffusion becomes less efficient, a larger mass of agents become innovators and fewer choose
to be imitators. As Proposition 5 shows, not only are there fewer imitators as m increases, but imitators
choose a BGP productivity ratio, x̄, that decreases with m. With a lower efficiency diffusion process,
imitating agents optimally respond by letting the ratio of their productivity to the technology frontier slip
lower and they benefit from the higher diffusion rate that comes from falling behind the frontier. Since s̄
is increasing in m, along a new BGP with less efficient diffusion, imitators increase expenditures that aid
technology diffusion, even as they fall further behind the technology frontier.
If we think of the recent trend of globalization and improvements in information technology as a decrease
in m, this theory suggests that the new BGP would feature fewer innovators and more imitators, with
the imitators spending less to increase diffusion and having a relatively higher ratio of productivity to the
technology frontier.

6.3

Does Less Efficient Diffusion Technology Always Lower x̄?

Proposition 5, shows that as m increases and imitation gets less efficient, the BGP productivity ratio of
imitators always decreases. Imitators choose x̄ optimally to balance the incentives for catch-up and fallback. Since m is not the only parameter controlling the efficiency of technology diffusion, do imitating agents
always choose to fall-back as imitation becomes less efficient? Equivalently, does there exist a sequence of
D(x) functions where imitation becomes strictly less efficient and agents choose to increase x̄?
To show that such a non-monotonicity can occur, Figure 5 conducts a variation of the experiment described in Section 6.2. To construct the sequence of D(x), this new experiment will vary m while changing
c to keep x∗ (m) constant. Hence, instead of the constant ĉ with the catch-up function D(x; m, ĉ), the multiplicative term
 on the
mcatch-up function will be adjusted to D(x; m, c(m)). The c(m) function is implicitly
mσ
defined by 1 − c(m)
= x∗ (ĉ). For all agents in the imitation region, ∂D(x;m,c(m))
< 0 for all x < x∗ ,
∂m

so an increase in m makes imitation less productive. This particular way of changing c and m also has the
advantage of keeping x∗ constant, which isolates the change in economic incentives on the intensive margin.
Figure 5 compares the results of changing both c and m to those of Section 6.2 where only m changes.21
The left column shows results for an experiment where c is held constant at ĉ and only m varies—similar to
Figure 4. The top row shows D(x; m, ĉ) for several values of m and the bottom row shows x̄(m, ĉ) and x∗ (m, ĉ)
as a function of m. The right column presents the new results, where the top row shows D(x; m, c(m)) and
the bottom row shows x̄(m, c(m)) and x∗ (m, c(m)).
The results show the non-monotonicity of x̄(m, c(m)) even while x∗ (m, c(m)) is constant. For m < 0, the
fall-back incentive dominates and agents choose to decrease x̄. For m > 0, the imitation technology becomes
so inefficient that the catch-up incentive dominates and agents choose to increase x̄.

6.4

Comparative Dynamics of c

While both c and m determine the marginal productivity of imitation, m has a distorting effect depending on
the distance to the frontier, while c changes the marginal productivity of innovation linearly and uniformly
for all x.
From equation 52 and Proposition 1, it follows that as c grows large, both x̄ and x∗ go to 1 and the
region where imitators fall behind will disappear. For agents below x̄, growth rates increase and approach
infinity as they approach the frontier. So for large c, we expect only the frontier to do research and all other
agents to be infinitesimally close to the frontier doing imitation.22
A critical feature of our catch-up specification is that technology diffusion is not instantaneous; the growth
of productivity at each instant depends on some measure of the distance to the frontier. The productivities
of firms or countries grow incrementally through diffusion from existing superior technologies at a rate that
depends on their investment in diffusion. This formulation differs from instantaneous one-shot adoption which
allows the implementation of a new technology drawn from the distribution of existing superior technologies,
as in Perla and Tonetti (2011) or Lucas and Moll (2012). The limits for large c give us a way to see how a
nearly instantaneous jump occurs, albeit here agents jump to the unique frontier rather than jumping to the
productivity of another agent in the economy, as in Perla and Tonetti (2011) or Lucas and Moll (2012).

7

Conclusion

All agents are identical except for their initial levels of productivity and they choose the intensity of their
investments to promote growth through imitation and innovation optimally. Innovation is a simple technology with a constant marginal productivity that does not benefit from externalities. Imitation facilitates
technology diffusion from the frontier, with the marginal productivity of imitation modeled by a catch-up
function that increases with distance to the technology frontier. In equilibrium, agents optimally segment
into innovators and imitators and converge to a unique and stable balanced growth path. All innovators grow
at the same rate, and therefore the ratio of their productivity to the technology frontier remains unchanged.
In the limit, the ratio of every imitator’s productivity to the technology frontier converges to a value that
lies below the threshold, where the incentives for catch-up and fall-back are balanced. When agents find
their productivities far below the technology frontier, they choose investments to facilitate the diffusion of
technology and catch-up to the balanced growth path by growing quickly. If agents are close to or at the
frontier, they focus their investments on promoting technological innovation. Agents with relatively high
productivity, but not high enough to innovate, optimally fall-back to the balanced growth path of imitators
to take advantage of more efficient technology diffusion. By focusing on the portfolio choice of allocating expenditures between imitation and innovation we describe the key forces that provide incentives for imitators
to fall-back and converge to a balanced growth path that lies below the technology frontier.

22 These

arguments are loose in that the sufficient conditions for concavity do not necessarily hold for large c. Also, note
that the flow costs s(t)z(t) of an instantaneous jump to the frontier are negligible in our setup as c → ∞. If there is a discrete
as opposed to flow consumption cost proportional to z(t) for enabling technology diffusion, whether a jump occurs or not will
depend on the discrete benefit of jumping to the frontier technology relative to the discrete cost.

Stability and Uniqueness

Uniqueness of Interior Stationary x̄

Lemma 2. For any quadratic of form y 2 − ay + b with roots y1 and y2 , if a, b > 0 and Discriminant > 0,
then both roots are real and positive. Furthermore, y1 , y2 ∈
/ [min{b, 1}, max{b, 1}] if a > 1 + b.
Proof. The result that roots are real and positive is a standard property of quadratic equations, as b is the
product of the roots and a is the sum of the roots. Assume that there exists a root ŷ ∈ [min{b, 1}, max{b, 1}].
Note that the product of the roots is given by P (ŷ) = ŷ(a − ŷ). Since P (ŷ) is concave, the argmin of P
is either b or 1. If we show that P (b) > b and P (1) > b, then we have a contradiction. P (1) = a − 1 and
P (b) = ba − b2 , so P (1) > b if a > 1 + b and P (b) > b if a > 1 + b. Thus if a > 1 + b, ŷ can not be in
[min{b, 1}, max{b, 1}].
To show that a unique root x̄ ∈ (0, x∗ ) exists, we take equation 52 in the form of q̄ 2 − aq̄ + b. For this

Thus the q̄ roots are real and positive, and hence x̄ roots are real and positive. It remains to show that there

is a unique x̄ ∈ (0, x∗ ). That is, there exists a unique q̄ s.t. q̄ m < b1/m . Using Assumption 1, the conditions

Therefore, the smaller root, q̄1 , is the unique stationary solution if m > 0 and the larger root, q̄2 , is the

unique stationary solution if m < 0. Thus there exists a unique root x̄ ∈ (0, x∗ ).

Stability of BGP

The proof of stability for the entire parameter space is completed as follows: First, prove stability for a
particular r by ensuring the determinant of the Jacobian of the dynamic system Ψ(·, ·), JΨ (·, ·), is negative.
Then, use a homotopy argument to show that the system must remain stable as r is varied throughout the

24

For the starting point of the homotopy argument, take the limit as r → σB, where g → 0. As proven in
Appendix A.1, q̄1 is the unique stationary root if m > 0, and q̄2 is the unique stationary root if m < 0. In
either case, the stationary solution, Ψ(s̄, q̄) = 0, as r → σB is

The determinant of this Jacobian evaluated at the steady state in the limit as r → σB is
det (JΨ̄ ) ≡ det (JΨ (s̄, q̄)) = B 2 σ(mσ − c)

(A.6)

The parameter restriction in Assumption 2 ensures that (mσ − c) < 0, and thus det (JΨ̄ ) < 0. Thus for a
small neighborhood around r = σB the system has local saddle-point stability. For clarity of exposition, let
Γ(s, x) be the equivalent system to Ψ(s, q) in x space. Since det (JΨ̄ ) < 0 near r = Bσ, then det (JΓ̄ ) < 0
near r = Bσ.
To complete the proof, use a homotopy argument for varying r, by parameterizing the system of equations
by r: Γr (s(r), x(r)). Let y(r) = (s(r), x(r)) and the steady state, ȳ(r) = (s̄(r), x̄(r)), be defined by Γ̄r ≡

Γr (ȳ) = 0 for r ∈ S where S = {ε, Bσ − ε} for small ε > 0. Since det JΓ̄r < 0 near r = Bσ, it is negative
at r = Bσ − ε for small ε > 0.

Let {ȳ(r)} = Γ−1
r (0) for isolated zeros of Γr (ȳ). For r ∈ S let ȳ(r) ∈ D ⊂ (0, B) × (0, 1), where D is

chosen so that there are no ȳ(r) ∈ ∂D. Then the homotopy invariant Poincare-Hopf degree on the boundary
X
∂D of D is
sign det (JΓr (y)) = 1 or −1. See Milnor (1965). Since the stationary point x̄(r), and
y∈{ȳ(r)}

therefore ȳ(r), is always unique for r ∈ S, then sign det (JΓr (ȳ(r))) = sign det JΓr (ȳ (Bσ − ε)) = −1.

If the roots of JΓr (ȳ(r)) are real, then they must be of opposite sign. Therefore det (JΓr (ȳ(r))) < 0 for

25

r ∈ S and the system is locally saddle-point stable: given x(0) we can choose s(0) on the stable manifold
converging to ȳ (r). Note that the roots of det (JΓr (ȳ(r))) cannot be complex since the determinant, the
product of the roots, would have to be positive in that case. Therefore x is a continuous function of time
c
described by the solution of ẋ = σγx + s (x) x m
(1 − xm ) with s (x) optimally chosen for r ∈ S. Therefore
the BGP has to be globally stable since dx
dt 6= 0 at points other than at the unique x̄(r), or the BGP would
dx
not be unique. Thus, it must be that dt > 0 to the left of x̄ and dx
dt < 0 to the right of x̄, so the unique
BGP is stable: all agents with productivities x(t) < x∗ eventually end up at x̄ (r).

This is enough to establish the required concavity over the range (x∗ , 1) where s = 0, and together with the

The range x < x∗ , where s ≥ 0, and γ = 0, is more complicated. Since γ = 0 over the latter region,

Proofs for Hicks-Neutral Technical Change

Note that fixing θ̄ ≡ σ̄c̄ , defining σ = Aσ̄, c = Ac̄, and taking derivatives with respect to A is mathematically
equivalent to varying c and keeping θ̄ constant by varying σ. For mathematical convenience, we will use this
alternative approach to the proofs.
