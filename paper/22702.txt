Subsidy Policies and Insurance Demand

ABSTRACT
Many new products presumed to be privately beneficial to the poor have a high price elasticity of
demand and ultimately zero take-up rate at market price. This has led governments and donors to
provide subsidies to increase take-up, with the concern of trying to limit their cost. In this study,
we use data from a two-year field experiment in rural China to define the optimum subsidy
scheme that can insure a given take-up for a new weather insurance for rice producers. We build
a model that includes the forces that are known to be determinants of insurance demand, provide
reduced form confirmation of their importance, validate the dynamic model with out-of-sample
predictions, and use it to conduct policy simulations. Results show that the optimum current
subsidy necessary to achieve a desired take-up rate depends on both past subsidy levels and past
payout rates, implying that subsidy levels should vary locally year-to-year.

Introduction

Whether to subsidize or not a beneficial product is a thorny issue for governments
and policymakers. On the one hand, there is reluctance to subsidize for the fear
of creating a spiral of subsidization by increasing preferences for leisure (Maestas,
Mullen, and Strand (2013)) or crowding out other unsubsidized products (Cutler and
Gruber (1996)). On the other hand, subsidies can be critical in achieving both product
learning and economies of scale through a minimum take-up rate. To address this
challenge, policymakers have sought to design "smart" subsidies that can fulfill their
immediate purpose of enhancing take-up while offering an exit option when demand
objectives have been met or minimizing costs if they have to be sustained (Cohen and
Dupas (2010)).
In this paper, we study the case of a new weather insurance for rice farmers in
China. Uninsured weather risks are known to be a major source of welfare loss for
farmers and to distort behavior in allocating resources (Rosenzweig and Binswanger
(1993), Dercon and Christiaensen (2011)).1 However, weather insurance products
typically face low take-up rates.2 To boost adoption, governments frequently choose
to subsidize the insurance.3 Subsidies can be successful in inducing immediate takeup if demand for the insurance product is price elastic (Karlan et al. (2014), Mobarak
and Rosenzweig (2014)). If take-up in turn induces learning, future subsidies could
be reduced and eventually eliminated. However, experience with insurance consists
in sharply contrasted outcomes as it maps continuous production losses into either
receiving or not receiving a payout.4 Although these outcomes should be no surprise,
1
To protect farmers from weather shocks, many governments have introduced comprehensive
financial strategies that allow the transfer of risk through disaster insurance (Cummins and Mahul
(2009)). In these cases, index-based insurance is often selected over standard insurance as it avoids
adverse selection and moral hazard concerns. It also sharply reduces implementation transaction
costs (Chantarat et al. (2013)).
2
For example, Cole et al. (2013) find an adoption rate of only 5%-10% for a similar insurance
policy in two regions of India in 2006. Higher take-up at market prices was observed in Ghana, but
only following a year of extensive payouts (Karlan et al. (2014)).
3
For example in Mexico, CADENA provides index-based drought insurance to 2 million smallholder farmers at a cost fully assumed by the state and federal governments. In India, the Weather
Based Crop Insurance Scheme covers 9.3 million farmers with an index-based scheme, where insurance purchase is compulsory for farmers that want to borrow from public financial institutions. For
farmers who grow food crops, the cost to the farmers themselves is less than 2% of the commercial
premium.
4
As we will see later in the paper, people respond to the binary experience of a payout rather
than to the amount of payout.

2

as it is in the nature of insurance to cover certain events and not others, it has
been shown that demand for insurance is very sensitive to the salience of shortterm realizations of payouts (Karlan et al. (2014), Gallagher (2014), Cole, Stein, and
Tobacman (2014)). This suggests that a policy that aims at ensuring a given take-up
at minimum cost could take advantage of this behavior and adjust the subsidy level
to the past realizations of payouts. This is the essence of our proposition.
We construct a model of response to stochastic experiences in which individuals
update their valuation of the insurance product with their recent experience. In our
model, we specify three recognized channels through which recent experience can
affect demand: (1) the effect of experiencing payout, with an expected positive effect
on take-up if there has been an insured shock and a payout has been received, and a
negative erosion effect if a premium has been paid and either no shock occurred or a
shock occurred without a corresponding payout, (2) the effect of observing network
payout experiences, which follows the same process of positive and negative effects
in relation to stochastic payouts, and (3) a habit forming effect, with past use of
the product influencing current demand. The influence of own and network payout
experiences have been identified by Karlan et al. (2014), Cole, Stein, and Tobacman
(2014), and Gallagher (2014). Persistence in adoption has been shown for insurance
by Hill, Robles, and Ceballos (2016), and for agricultural inputs by Carter, Laajaj,
and Yang (2014). We model how these channels would be impacted by subsidies
through three separate effects: (1) a scope effect where subsidies enhance take-up
and hence the opportunity of witnessing payouts, (2) an attention effect where a
lower insurance cost for the individual leads to lower attention given to information
generated by payout experiences (as evidenced for use of health products in Ashraf,
Berry, and Shapiro (2010)), and (3) a price anchoring effect, where low past prices
reduce current willingness to pay (evidenced in Cohen and Dupas (2010)).
We confirm the importance of these forces with reduced form estimations, using
a two-year randomized field experiment that includes 134 villages with about 3,500
households in rural China. In the first year, we randomized subsidy policies at the
village level by offering either a partial subsidy of 70% of the actuarially fair price or
a full subsidy. In the second year, we randomly assigned eight prices to the product
at the household level, with subsidies ranging from 40% to 90%.
Results show that those households receiving a full subsidy in the first year exhibit
greater demand for insurance in the second year, but that this demand is not differ3

entially price elastic compared to that of households receiving a partial subsidy in the
first year. Exploring the channels through which this happens, we show that, first,
receiving a payout has a positive effect on second year demand, and makes demand
for the insurance product less price elastic. This effect is stronger for those households that paid for their insurance, supporting the presence of an attention effect.
Symmetrically, the reduction in demand when there was no payout is stronger when
households had to pay for the insurance, showing evidence of an erosion effect. Second, we find that observing payouts in their network increases second-year demand
for those not insured in the first year. For those that received insurance for free, we
see a mild effect of observing payouts in their network if they did not receive a payout
themselves. To explain why the payout effect is smaller under the full subsidy policy,
we show that people paid less attention to the payout information if they received
the insurance for free. Third, we find no evidence of price anchoring: restricting the
sample to households who purchased (in non-free villages) or were willing to purchase
(in free villages) the insurance at a 70% subsidy in the first year and facing higher
subsidies in the second year, the second year take-up rate is not lower among households who got a full subsidy. Finally, we find that holding insurance in the first year
does not influence either the level or the slope of the demand curve in the following
year. This finding suggests that enlarging the coverage rate is not enough to secure
persistence in insurance take-up.
We then jointly estimate the combined role of these channels in a demand model
over the two years of the experiment on the whole sample, allowing for interactions
between price, own payout, and network payout experiences revealed in the reduced
form estimations. We validate the model predictions by comparing them to the
observed take-up over the 3 years beyond the period of estimation. Results show
no evidence of weakening of the effect of payout experience over time. The model
is then used to simulate policy options. We are in particular interested in defining
the minimum level of subsidy that is necessary to ensure a given take-up. We find
that current subsidies can be reduced when the previous year’s subsidy level and
payout rates were higher. This finding suggests that subsidies need to be continuously
adjusted to achieve the desired take-up rate at the minimum cost. We provide a way
of designing a simple policy rule that a budget-constrained government can use to
determine the optimum level of subsidy in a particular location and at a particular
time to achieve the desired level of take-up.
4

A number of studies have examined the impact of providing subsidies on the takeup of products where the product experience is non-stochastic. For example, Dupas
(2014) finds that a one-time subsidy for insecticide-treated bednets has a positive
effect on take-up the following year, a result which is mainly driven by a large positive
learning effect. In another study, Fischer et al. (2014) find that positive learning can
offset price anchoring in the long term adoption of health products. Finally, Carter,
Laajaj, and Yang (2014) find that subsidies in Mozambique induce both short-term
take-up and long-term persistence in the demand for fertilizer and improved seeds,
which they attribute to both direct and social learning effects. Our results contribute
to this literature by showing that products with stochastic benefits may need to have
continuously adjusted subsidy rates based on both past subsidy levels and payout
rates.
Our study also contributes to the literature on the optimal design of financial
strategies for disaster risk financing and insurance. Countries typically use a combination of financial reserves, contingent credit, index insurance, and post-disaster
budget reallocations and borrowing in forming their disaster risk financing plans. The
design of such strategies has been explored through both actuarial cost-minimization
(Clarke et al. (2015)) and Probabilistic Catastrophe Risk Models (CAPRA (2015)).
We extend this analysis by formalizing a rule for how subsidy use can be optimized
when stochastic experiences determine private take-up.
The paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we explain the background for the
insurance product in China. In section 3, we present the experimental design and
discuss the data collected. In section 4, we develop a model of insurance demand,
conceptualizing the different channels that impact subsequent insurance take-up. In
section 5, we outline the reduced form estimation strategy and present both the
aggregate and channel-level results of our analysis. Section 6 reports on the estimation
of the model and the policy simulations. Section 7 concludes with a discussion of
policy implications.

Background

Rice is the most important food crop in China, with nearly 50% of the country’s farmers engaged in its production. In order to maintain food security and shield farmers
from negative weather shocks, in 2009 the Chinese government asked the People’s
5

Insurance Company of China (PICC) to design and offer the first rice production insurance policy to rural households in 31 pilot counties.5 The program was expanded
to 62 counties in 2010 and then to 99 in 2011. The experiment was conducted in 2010
and 2011 in randomly selected villages included in the 2010 expansion, in Jiangxi
province, one of China’s major rice producing areas. In the selected villages, rice
production is the main source of income for most farmers. Given the new nature of
the insurance product, farmers and government officials had limited understanding of
weather insurance and no previous interaction with the PICC.
The product in our study is an area-index based insurance policy that covers
natural disasters, including heavy rains, floods, windstorms, extremely high or low
temperatures, and droughts. If any of these natural disasters occurs and leads to a
30% or more average loss in yield, farmers are eligible to receive payouts from the
insurance company. The amount of the payout increases linearly with the loss rate in
yield, from 60 RMB per mu for a 30% loss to a maximum payout of 200 RMB per mu
for a full yield loss.6 Areas for indexing are typically fields that include the plots of
5 to 10 farmers. The average loss rate in yield is assessed by a committee composed
of insurance agents and agricultural experts. Since the average gross income from
cultivating rice in the experimental sites is around 800 RMB per mu, and production
costs around 400 RMB per mu, the insurance policy covers 25% of the gross income
or 50% of production costs. The actuarially fair price for the policy is 12 RMB
per mu, or 3% of production costs, per season.7 If a farmer decides to buy the
insurance, the premium is deducted from a rice production subsidy deposited annually
in each farmer’s bank account, with no cash payment needed, removing any liquidity
constraint problem, identified for example by Giné, Townsend, and Vickery (2008)
and Cole et al. (2013) in India.8
5

Although there was no insurance before 2009, if major natural disasters occurred, the government
made payments to households whose production had been seriously hurt by the disaster. However,
the level of transfer was usually far from sufficient to help farmers resume normal levels of production
the following year.
6
For example, consider a farmer who has 5 mu in rice production. If the normal yield per mu is
500kg and the area yield decreases to 250kg per mu because of a windstorm, then the loss rate is
50% and he will receive 200 ∗ 50% = 100 RMB per mu from the insurance company.
7
1 RMB = 0.15 USD; 1 mu = 0.165 acre. Farmers produce two or three seasons of rice each year.
The annual gross income per capita in rural Jiangxi is around 5000 RMB.
8
Starting in 2004, the Chinese government provided production subsidies to rice farmers in order
to increase production incentives. Each year, subsidies are deposited directly in the farmers’ accounts
at the Rural Credit Cooperative, China’s main rural bank.

6

Like with any area-yield insurance product, it is possible that insured farmers
may collude. However, given that the maximum payout (200 RMB/mu) is much
lower than the expected profit (800 RMB/mu), and the verifiable nature of natural
disasters, it is unlikely that the insurance is subject to moral hazard concerns.9

Experimental Design and Data

3.1

Experimental Design

The experimental site consists in 134 randomly selected villages in Jiangxi Province
with around 3500 households. We carried out a two-year randomized experiment in
Spring 2010 and 2011.
The experimental design is presented in Figure I. The treatment involves randomization of the subsidy level in each year of the study. In the first year, we randomized
the subsidy policy at the village level. The insurance product was first offered at
3.6 RMB/mu, i.e. with a 70% subsidy on the fair price, to all households in order to
observe take-up at that price. Two days after this initial sale, households from 62 randomly selected villages were surprised with an announcement that the insurance will
be offered for free to all, regardless of whether they had agreed to buy it or not at the
initial price. These villages are referred to as the "free sample" while the remaining
72 villages as the "non-free sample". This design allows us to distinguish "buyers" of
insurance who agree to pay the offer price of 3.6 RMB/mu from "users" of insurance
who include all buyers from the non-free sample group as well as all households from
the free sample group. As reported in Figure I, the insurance take-up rate at the 3.6
RMB/mu price is similar in the two samples at around 40-43%.
For the first year village randomization, we stratified villages by their total number
of households. In order to generate exogenous variation in individual insurance takeup decisions, we also randomized a default option in 80% of the villages. We assigned
half the households in a given village with a default "BUY" option, meaning the
farmer must sign off if he does not want to purchase the insurance. We assigned the
other half with a default "NOT BUY" option, meaning the farmer must sign on if he
decides to buy the insurance. Both groups otherwise received the same pitch for the

If there were moral hazard problems, the likelihood of collusion should increase with the price
paid by farmers. We tested the impact of price on the payout probability and found it small and
insignificant.

product. The randomized default option will be used in some estimation as an IV
for the first year insurance purchase decisions together with the randomized subsidy
policy. Note that the first year of our study coincided with a fairly large occurrence
of adverse weather events that triggered insurance payouts, with 59% of the insured
receiving a payout from the insurance company.
In the second year of the study, we randomized the subsidy level from 90 to 40%
of the fair price for every household. This creates eight different price treatment
subgroups. Except for the price, everything else remained the same in the insurance
contract as in the first year.10 Similar to the design in Dupas (2014), only two or
three prices are assigned within each village.11 For example, if one village is assigned
a price set (1.8, 3.6, 5.4), each household in that village is randomly assigned to one
of these three prices. To randomize price sets at the village level, we stratified villages
by size (total number of households) and first year village-level insurance payout rate.
To randomize prices within the set, we stratified households by rice production area.
In both years, we offered information sessions about the insurance policy to farmers, in which we explain the insurance premium, the amount of government subsidy,
the responsibility of the insurance company, the maximum payout, the period of coverage, the rules for loss verification, and the procedures for making payouts. Households
made their insurance purchase decision immediately after the information session. In
the second-year information session, we also informed farmers of the list of people in
the village who were insured and of the payouts made during the first year at both
the household and village level.

3.2

Data and Summary Statistics

The empirical analysis is based on the administrative data of insurance purchase
and payout from the insurance company, and on household surveys conducted after
the insurance information session each year. Since almost all households have rice
production, and all rice producers were invited to the information session with a more
than 90% attendance rate, this provides us with a quasi census of the population of
10

This two-year price randomization scheme is similar to Karlan et al. (2014), but, by eliciting
demand before surprising people with free offer in the first year, we can look at price effect absent
of selection
11
Price sets with either two or three different prices are randomly assigned at the village level.
For villages assigned with two prices (P1 , P2 ), P1 <= 3.6 and P2 > 3.6; for villages with three prices
(P1 , P2 , P3 ), P1 < 3.6, P2 ∈ (3.6, 4.5), and P3 > 4.5.

these 134 villages, a representative sample of rice-producers in Jiangxi. In total, 3474
households were surveyed.
We present the summary statistics of selected variables in Table I. The statistics
in Panel A show that household heads are almost exclusively male and cultivate
on average 12 mu (0.80 ha) of rice per year. Rice production is the main source of
household income, accounting on average for almost 70% of total income. Households
indicate an average risk aversion of 0.2 on a scale of zero to one (risk averse).12 In Panel
B, we summarize the payouts issued during the year following the first insurance offer.
With a windstorm hitting some sample villages, 59% of all insured households received
a payout in the first year of our study, with an average payout size of around 90 RMB.
The payout rate was not significantly different between households in free vs. nonfree villages, at 61% and 57%, respectively. For the non-free villages, this corresponds
to 24% of all households. All households, regardless of whether they purchased the
insurance or not, could also observe their friends’ experiences. Identification of friends
comes from a social network census conducted before the experiment in year one.
In that survey, we asked household heads to list five close friends, either within
or outside the village, with whom they most frequently discuss rice production or
financial issues.13 In the sample of non-free villages, 68% of households had at least
one friend receiving a payout, while in free villages, 81% of households observed at
least one of their friends receiving a payout. As a result, since more households were
covered by insurance in villages with full subsidies, most households were able to
enjoy the benefits of insurance by themselves, or could observe their friends’ positive
experiences with the product. Lastly, Panel C shows that the first year take-up rate
was 41% while the second year take-up rate was 53%, with this increase corresponding
to a 7.3 (16.3) percentage point increase in the non-free (free) villages.
To verify the price randomization, we regress the five main household characteristics (gender, age, household size, education, and area of rice production) on a
12

Risk attitudes are elicited by asking households to choose between a certain amount with increasing values of 50, 80, 100, 120, and 150 RMB (riskless option A), and a risky gamble of (200
RMB, 0) with probability (0.5, 0.5) (risky option B). The proportion of riskless options chosen is
then used as a measure of risk aversion, which ranges from 0 to 1.
13
About 92% of the network connections are within villages, suggesting that inter-village spillover
effects should be small. For a detailed description of the network data, please refer to Cai, de Janvry,
and Sadoulet (2015).

4.1

Theoretical Framework
Set-up

The net utility of buying insurance is posited to be additive in gains and costs. We
assume that there are two states of nature, and let pL be the probability of a negative
weather shock, and pH = 1 − pL . The benefit V L of having insurance in a negative
weather shock state is the utility gain of receiving a payout at the low realization of
income y L , V L = U (y L + payout) − U (y L )), while the utility gain in the absence of
a shock is V H = 0. Without other information, the expected utility gain of having
insurance at the onset of the first year is:
EV1 = pL V L + pH V H .
In the context of insurance products, any experience from one period is contingent
on the realization of the state of nature. We assume a simple updating model, the
temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL in Sutton and Barto (1998)), which
incorporates recency effects. In this model, individuals update their valuations based
on the realization in the previous period:
∗
EVt = EVt−1 + λ Vt−1
− EVt−1



(2)

∗
where Vt−1
is the experienced benefit in year t − 1. This experienced benefit results
from either your own realization Vt−1 or observing your network realization N etVt−1
in the previous year. It also depends on It−1 , an indicator of whether an individual

10

is insured at the time of the realization. Without specifying further, the functional
∗
form is Vt−1
= g(Vt−1 , N etVt−1 , It−1 ).
∗
− EVt−1 represents a prediction error. If this term is
Note that the term Vt−1
positive (negative), then the realized value of the insurance is higher (lower) than its
expected value. In this specification, λ controls the rate at which information from
past observations is discounted. When λ = 1, the expected value of insurance is the
previous year’s realization; when λ = 0, there is no updating in the expected benefits
from insurance. The higher the parameter, the more responsive individuals are to
the recent realizations. The model thus captures "recency bias". We further specify
λ to be a function of the price paid for the insurance: λt = λ(pt−1 ). In this way, our
model is similar to a Bayesian learning model that allows for incomplete information
or poor recall related to past events (Gallagher, 2014). However, in our model, a belief
is updated regarding the value of the insurance, as it is really the payout experience
and not the weather event that influences subsequent take-up decisions, as we will
see it later.
The cost of insurance includes three terms: the price at which the insurance is
offered pt , a gain-loss in utility which we assume to be a linear function of the difference
between the offered price and a reference price, γ(pt − prt ), and a transaction cost δt .
Transaction costs are assumed to depend on past experience, i.e., δt = δ(It−1 ). Adding
a preference shock t , the overall utility of purchasing insurance for an individual then
becomes:
Wt − t ≡ EVt−1 + λt (g(Vt−1 , N etVt−1 , It−1 ) − EVt−1 ) + βpt + γ (pt − prt ) It−1 + δt − t
(3)

4.2

Link with the Experiment

In the experiment, we analyze the purchase of insurance in years 1 and 2 such that:
Buy1 = 1 if 1 < W1 ≡ EV1 + βp∗1
= 0 otherwise
Buy2 = 1 if 2 < W2 ≡ EV1 + λ(p1 ) (g(V1 , N etV1 , I1 ) − EV1 ) + βp2 + γ (p2 − p1 ) I1 + δ(I1 )
= 0 otherwise

(4)

11

Note that there are two prices for period 1: the price p∗1 is the unique price at
which the insurance was first offered to all farmers in order to elicit their demand
for insurance. Then, in a random sample of villages, farmers were "surprised" by a
government decision to give out the insurance for free. The reference price that enters
the second year decision, p1 , is thus either the initial price offer p∗1 or 0. This design
allows us to separate the insurance purchase Buy1 (at p∗1 ) from access I1 , which also
includes farmers that receive the insurance in year 1 for free after choosing not to buy
it originally.
These two preference shocks are correlated. We further assume that they are
jointly distributed Normal: 1 , 2 ∼ N(0, 0, 1, 1, ρ). The probability of observing a
given purchase behavior over the two years is thus:

P r(Buy1 = b1 , Buy2 = b2 ) = Φ(b1 W1 + (1 − b1 )(1 − W1 ),
b2 W2 + (1 − b2 )(1 − W2 ), ρ), for b1 , b2 ∈ (0, 1)
which can also be written as:
P r(Buy1 = b1 , Buy2 = b2 ) = Φ(q1 W1 , q2 W2 , q1 q2 ρ)

(5)

with qt = 2bt − 1, t = 1, 2.
Note that we have distinguished purchase and access in year 1 to accommodate
the experimental design. In the policy simulation, however, access is determined
endogenously by the first year purchase decision.
The different mechanisms that may influence the purchase of insurance in the
second year are readily seen in the W2 expression:
• Effect of own payout experience: This mechanism enters the equation through
the realized V1 in expression (4), creating a recency bias in demand. Neglecting
any network effect, for those insured in year 1, the term g(V1 , N etV1 , I1 ) −
EV1 is equal to V1 − EV1 . If these households experience a weather shock
and subsequent payout, this term is positive and their demand increases. By
contrast, with no weather shock, V1 − EV1 is negative and insurance demand
drops, revealing an erosion effect. Since the updating parameter is a function
of the price in year 1, λ(p1 ), the rate of updating can be sharper under a partial
12

subsidy than when insurance is provided for free, due to an attention effect.
• Effect of observing network payouts: This mechanism enters the equation through
N etV1 in g(V1 , N etV1 , I1 ). The effect is qualitatively similar to that of receiving
a payout.
• Habit formation and transaction costs enter the equation through the term δ(I1 )
The respective effects of any first year price subsidy on second year take-up can
also be identified in equation (4):
• A scope effect or potential for experience through its determination of access I1
in year 1.
• An attention effect with its influence on the rate of adjustment in expectation
through λ(p1 ).
• A price anchoring effect with the term γ (p2 − p1 ).

Reduced Form Results

In this section, we estimate the reduced form relationship between the first year
subsidy level and the second year insurance take-up rate. We first compare the overall
second year insurance take-up in villages that either received the insurance for free
or paid a base price of 3.6 RMB/mu in the first year. We then verify the identified
channels leading to the aggregate effect, including the effect of experiencing payouts,
price anchoring, and habit formation.

5.1

The Aggregate Effect of First-Year Subsidies on SecondYear Take-up

To evaluate the aggregate effect of providing insurance for free in the first year, we
estimate the following equation:

where T akeupij2 is an indicator for the purchase decision made by household i in
village j in year two, P riceij2 the price that it faced, F reeij1 an indicator for being

under full subsidy in the first year, Xij are household characteristics such as gender,
age, production size, etc., and ηj are region dummies.
Results in Table III, column (1), show that the second year take-up rate among
households offered a full subsidy in the first year is higher than that of households
offered a partial subsidy (by 5.97 percentage points, about a 10% increase, significant
at the 10% level). The results in column (2) show that adding controls does not affect
our findings. The results in column (3) show that households with different first year
subsidies do not differ in the slope of their demand curve. The slope parameter of
−0.49 translates into a price elasticity of -0.44 for the price level of 3.6 RMB/mu and
the corresponding take-up rate of 40%. This is lower than the [-1.04, -1.16] range for
the price elasticity found in Gujarat by Cole et al. (2013), but of the same order of
magnitude as the U.S. price elasticities which they cite (in the [-.32, -.73] range).

5.2

Mechanisms Driving the Subsidy Effect on Insurance TakeUp

While the observed aggregate effect may seem small, it is the result of a number
of opposing forces and heterogeneous effects that we now explore. In particular, we
analyze three potential channels of causation between subsidy policies and subsequent
demand for insurance: the effect of experiencing payouts, price anchoring, and habit
formation.
5.2.1

Effect of Experiencing Payouts - Direct and Social Effects

The experience of receiving or observing insurance payouts is known to increase households’ take-up. However, the impact of subsidy levels on this experience effect is
ambiguous. On the one hand, a subsidy may increase initial take-up rates, meaning
more people may receive or observe payouts. On the other hand, if a household has
not contributed to paying for its own insurance, less attention may be paid to the
payout outcomes.14
To explore the impact of payout experience on subsequent take-up, we first examine the effect of directly receiving a payout in the first year on second year insurance
14

For experience-based goods, two arguments have been given for why the effect could be lower
when people pay less: the "screening effect" of prices could be lower (Ashraf, Berry, and Shapiro
(2010)) or people who pay more for a product may feel more obliged to use it; thus, the "sunk cost"
effect is higher with lower subsidies.

14

demand. To maintain sample comparability, we restrict this analysis to those households that pay for insurance (in the non-free villages) or are willing to do so (in the
free villages) in the first year. Figures II.a and II.b compare the free and non-free
group insurance demand curves for households that receive a payout to those for
households that do not receive a payout. These figures show that receiving a payout
induces a higher level of renewal of the insurance contract and makes the insurance
less price elastic. The corresponding estimating equation is:
T akeupij2 = α1 P riceij2 + α2 P ayoutij1 + α3 P riceij2 ∗ P ayoutij1 + α4 Xij + ηj + ij (7)
where P ayoutij1 is a dummy variable equal to one if the household received a payout
in year 1.
We report the estimation results in Table IV. For households that received a
partial subsidy in the first year (columns (1) and (2)), receiving a payout improves
their second year take-up rate by 35 percentage points, and mitigates the subsidy
removal (price) effect by around 80%.15 To control for any potential confounding
effect related to the fact that experiencing a bad weather shock could affect people’s
risk attitudes or perceived probability of future disasters, we include these variables
in the vector of household characteristics Xij . To further control for any direct effect
due to the severity of a weather-related loss, we use a regression discontinuity method,
with the loss rate as the running variable and instrumenting payout with the 30% loss
rate threshold. The results of this analysis, in column (3), show that the payout effect
is still large and significant, suggesting that the weather shock event does not explain
the payout effect. For households that receive a full subsidy in the first year (columns
(4)-(6)), the magnitude of the payout effect is only about half of that observed for
households that paid some amount for their insurance. The effect of a payout on the
slope of the second year demand curve is similar in size but is less significant.
To further characterize the payout effect, note in Figures II.a and II.b that absent
a payout, there is a very substantial decline in take-up rate at 3.6 RMB/mu from
100% in year 1 to 45-60% in year 2, depending on whether the insurance was free
or not in year 1, while the demand after a payout is higher among those that paid
for the insurance in the first year. Column (7) of Table IV confirms this: in absence
15

We also test the impact of the amount of payout received in the first year on second year take-up
rates (Table A1). The effect pattern is similar to that indicated in Table IV.

15

of payout, the demand for insurance is higher after a year of free experience than it
is if households have paid some amount for their insurance. However, the opposite
holds true if a payout has been received. These results suggest that providing a full
subsidy mitigates any payout reaction, with less of a decline in demand when there
is no payout but also a smaller positive effect when there is a payout.
We next examine the effect of observing payouts in your network on subsequent insurance take-up rates. To do so, we include the network payout variable, N etP ayHigh.
This is a dummy variable that indicates whether more than half of the insured members within a farmer’s personal network received a payout in the first year. The
results in Table V, column (1) indicates that the effect of observing payouts in your
network on subsequent insurance take-up is smaller among households that received
a full subsidy.
To better understand the interaction between the direct and social effects of payouts, we look at the results for three groups separately: households not insured in the
first year, households that paid for the insurance, and households that received a full
subsidy. The estimating equation is as follows:
T akeupij2 =α1 P riceij2 + α2 N etP ayHighij1 + α3 P ayoutij1
+α4 N etP ayHighij1 ∗ P ayoutij1 + α5 N etT akeupij1 + ηj + ij

(8)

where N etT akeupij1 is the proportion of friends in one’s social network who purchased
the insurance in the first year, instrumented by the household head’s education and
the default first-year insurance option.16
Column (2) of Table V shows that households not insured in year 1 (and hence
without any direct experience) are strongly influenced by their network experience. In
contrast those that purchased the insurance are solely affected by their own experience
(column (3)). Among households that received a full subsidy, observing payouts to
their network influences subsequent take-up only for those that have not received
any payout themselves (column(4)).17 This effect is half of what is observed for
16

One problem of using default as the IV is that it might influence people’s understanding of the
insurance and the level of trust on the insurance company (as the product is heavily subsidized). We
tested the impact of default on knowledge of the insurance product and trust in year 1, the effects
are small and not significant.
17
We also examine the effect of peer experience among those not willing to buy the insurance
initially but then receiving it as part of the "free" treatment condition and find a similar impact
magnitude.

16

those that were not insured (column (2)).18 In conclusion, households that had a
tangible experience with the insurance (either because they purchased it or because
they received it for free but benefited from a payout) rely on their own experience to
update their valuation of the insurance, while those that either were not insured or
insured for free and had no payout are influenced in their decision by the experience
of their network.
What factors are driving the impact of self or friends payout experience on longterm insurance demand? First, it could be that experiencing payouts change farmers’
perceived probability of future disasters or risk aversion. However, results in Table
IV suggest that we observe large and significant payout effects even when those two
variables are controlled. Second, the results can be induced by either an improvement
in trust in the insurance company or by a wealth effect.19 We test and reject the trust
and wealth effects as follows. We construct a trust index based on household responses
to a question in the second year survey as to whether they trust the insurance company
regarding loss assessment and the payout issuing process. Regressing this trust index
on receiving or observing a payout shows no effect, in either non-free or free villages
(Table A4). Furthermore, we find that adding the trust index in the regressions of
insurance take-up in year 2 on payout does not change the payout coefficients. For
the wealth effect, we looked at heterogeneity in the effect of one’s own payout on
take-up in year 2 by year 1 household area of land for rice production, and find no
significant effect (Table A5). Third, since this was the first time farmers experienced
a weather insurance, observing how it works (you do receive a payout when you
have a large loss) may have provided confirmation in farmers’ understanding of the
insurance product. If this was the main reason for the second year take-up patterns, it
should be a one time learning, with stabilization after the first year. With a two-year
experiment, we cannot rigorously dismiss this argument. However, indirectly we will
do so through the simulation exercise in section 6.2. We will use the estimated model
to simulate take-up for the 3 years 2012-2014 beyond the experiment, and verify that
18

We also use two other indicators of network payouts to estimate equation (8): a dummy variable
indicating whether a household has at least one friend receiving payout and the average amount of
payout received by friends. The results are reported in Tables A2 and A3, respectively. These results
show that while people care about whether their friends receive any payout (Table A2), they do not
pay much attention to the amount of the payout (Table A3).
19
Cole, Gine, and Vickery (2014) show that being insured improve trust in the insurance company
and that this effect is larger (although not significantly) for those receiving a payout.

17

it reproduces the observed aggregate take-up.20
As a result, we conclude that the direct and social effect of experience is mainly
driven by the salience of either the benefits or the costs of insurance from observing
payouts or absence of payouts. To further support this argument, we explore the
finding that those who receive a full subsidy exhibit a smaller effect of payout on
subsequent take-up rates. We examine household information session attendance
and performance on a short knowledge quiz. We find no significant difference in
the attendance rate between villages with different first year subsidy policies (both
at 86%). However, on a question testing a household’s knowledge of the payout
rate in their village, 55% of respondents in the non-free villages answered correctly,
but only 36% in free villages did so (Table A6). We use this finding as evidence
that households that receive a full subsidy pay less attention to payout information,
reducing the salience effect.
5.2.2

Price Anchoring

We next consider whether there is a price anchoring effect (which would make the price
subsidy less attractive to policy makers). To assess the possibility of an anchoring
effect, we examine the set of households that were willing to purchase the insurance
at 3.6 RMB/mu in the first year and that are assigned a price lower or equal to 3.6
RMB/mu in the second year. For this group, the second year price is an increase
for those that receive a full subsidy in the first year, and a decrease or no change for
those that received a partial subsidy. If there is an anchoring effect, we should see a
lower second-year take-up rate among the households with full subsidy the first year.
However, regression results in Table VI show that the difference between those who
are fully subsidized and those who are not is small and insignificant. As a result, we
do not find evidence for a price anchoring effect in this range of prices.
5.2.3

Habit formation

Finally, to assess the existence of habit formation, we test whether households are
more likely to buy insurance in the second year if they are insured in the first year
20

While we do not have the individual take-up information beyond 2011, the insurance company
provided the aggregate take-up for the county until 2014.

18

with the following regression:
T akeupij2 = α1 P riceij2 +α2 Insuredij1 +α3 P riceij2 ∗Insuredij1 +α4 Xij +ηj +ij (9)
where Insuredij1 is an indicator for being insured for household i in village j in
the first year. Since being insured in the first year is endogenous to the second
year purchase behavior, we use first year subsidy policies (free or non-free) and the
randomized default options as instruments for Insuredij1 .
The estimation results in column (1) of Table VII show that these two instruments
have a significant effect on first year take-up decisions. Furthermore, the IV results
in columns (4) and (5) suggest that having insurance for one year does not influence
either the level or the slope of the demand curve in the following year. As a result,
we conclude that simply enlarging the coverage rate in the initial year is not sufficient
to improve the second year take-up rate.
Overall, we conclude that the regression results validate the empirical relevance
of the channels we examine as mechanisms in our model of response to stochastic
experiences.

Model Estimation and Policy Simulation

In this section, we jointly estimate the two demand equations of the model in Section
4.2. The empirical specification that we estimate is the following:
P r(Buyij1 = bij1 , Buyij2 = bij2 ) = Φ(qij1 Wij1 , qij2 Wij2 , qij1 qij2 ρ)

(10)

with qijt = 2bijt − 1, t = 1, 2
Wij1 = µj + βp∗1

(11)

Wij2 = µj + η + βpi2
+ Ii1 [λ1 pi1 + (λ2 + λ3 pi1 )P ayouti + (λ4 + λ5 pi1 )N etP ayHighi + (λ6 + λ7 pi1 )
P ayouti N etP ayHighi ] + (1 − Ii1 )λ8 N etP ayHighi + γ(pi2 − pi1 )Ii1 + δIi1
(12)
where µj are village fixed effects and η is a second year fixed effect. The interaction
effect between P ayout and N etP ayHigh is notably suggested by the reduced form
19

estimation. In the above expression, δ combines the negative effect of no-payout when
the insurance is fully subsidized and the benefit from reduced transaction costs due to
previous experience. Its sign depends on the relative strength of these two forces. The
parameter λ1 shows the additional (negative) effect of no-payout when a household
paid for the insurance.
Estimating the system allows us to exploit the first- and second-year decisions
jointly in the whole sample, controlling for selection through correlated unobservable
factors.

6.1

ML Estimation Results

We report the results from the Maximum Likelihood estimation in Table VIII.21
Specifically, we estimate village fixed effects µj , year fixed effect η, price response β,
response to payouts (λ1 − λ8 ), anchoring effect γ, and habit formation effect δ.
Column (3) reports conditional marginal effects for the take-up in year 2,
∂W2
∂P r(Buy2 = 1|I1 )
= φ(W2 )
∂x
∂x
These effects can be compared with the results from the reduced form estimations in
section 5. In general, we find that marginal effects are similar to the reduced form
values, with the exception of a higher habit formation effect. The joint estimation also
allows estimating a year 2 fixed effect. It is negative but not statistically significant.
The similar results across these two estimations provide informal validation for the
two approaches. The advantage of the joint estimation is that it yields one consistent
set of parameters for the whole sample, while the reduced form estimates rigorously
use the randomization on corresponding sub-samples.
Results from the joint estimation confirm the negative price response of insurance
demand, with a 4.4% reduction per additional RMB/mu. In addition, using a nonparametric estimation for each of the nine assigned prices, we find no evidence of
non-linearity for W2 . We confirm the importance of receiving a payout for those
insured, equivalent to a reduction in price by 3.9 or 9.6 RMB/mu22 depending on
21
The estimated parameters are robust to including individual covariates. However, given the
absence of covariates for non-sample network members, only a model without covariates can be used
for simulations.
22
This is for farmers with less than half of their network having received a payout, and is computed
as λ2 /β or (λ2 + λ3 )/β

20

whether they have received it for free or not (or 32 or 80% of the fair price) and of
observing payouts in the network for those not insured (equivalent to a reduction of
5.2 RMB/mu if more than half of the network has received a payout). We also find
an important habit forming effect: having had access to insurance in the first year
with a full subsidy is equivalent to a 2.2 RMB/mu price reduction. Finally, the role
of the price in influencing the attention to payout is clear from these results: λ3 is
positive, indicating that individuals who paid for their insurance value any payout
received more than those who received a full subsidy. λ1 is negative, indicating that
this group is also more discouraged by the absence of any payout.
To illustrate the tradeoff between coverage and attention as a function of the first
year subsidy rate, we consider two payout extremes. At one extreme, we suppose that
there is no weather incident in the first year and thus no one receives a payout. In this
case, the second year take-up rate is a function of I1 (δ + λ1 p1 ) = I1 (0.268 − 0.142p1 ),
where δ > 0 embeds the habit formation effect, and λ1 < 0 is the differential negative
effect of not receiving a payout when one paid for the insurance. Here, a higher
subsidy level (lower p1 ) both increases the coverage I1 in the first year and reduces
the negative effect of no payout, leading to the second year take-up being a negative
function of the price paid in year 1. At the other extreme, if everyone receives a
payout in the first year, the second year take-up rate is a function of I1 (δ + λ2 +
λ4 + λ6 + (λ1 + λ3 + λ5 + λ7 )p1 ) = I1 (0.764 + 0.087p1 ). Here, both the intercept and
the coefficient on the price are positive. Hence, while a higher subsidy level increases
coverage, it also reduces the attention to payout experience.
Figure III provides a decomposition of the overall model into its elements. Panel
III.a reports simulations for a price at 3.6 RMB/mu and a payout rate of 60%. Takeup in the first year is, as in the experiment, 40.1%. Ignoring all payout and habit
formation effects, take-up over the next two years exhibits a small negative time trend
(parameter η). When we add the positive habit formation effect (δ), the take-up rate
stabilizes at just above 40%. When we add the direct payout effect (λ1 − λ3 ), those
that did purchase the insurance update their valuation of the insurance product from
their own experience. In this simulation 60% of the insured farmers (i.e., 24% of
the population) updated it positively but 40% (16% of the population) updated it
negatively. The net is positive and the overall take-up increases to 44%. Allowing
the influence of payouts to others (λ4 − λ8 ) further increases the take-up as the 60%
that had not purchased the insurance in year 1 can now observe the relatively large
21

payout rate. With this full model, take-up reaches 51%. Finally, if we do not allow for
differential attention due to having paid for the insurance (λ1 = λ3 = λ5 = λ7 = 0),
the take-up would be slightly higher, due to a mix of greater take-up by those that
did not receive a payout but lower take-up by those that did receive a payout. With
a universal 100% payout, represented in panel III.b, increased attention only has a
positive effect and there is indeed a higher take-up with attention. We also show
results for the case where there would be no payout in panel 3b. The differential
attention effect makes take-up fall by eight percentage points to 33%.
This decomposition shows how each component of the model is important in
determining the final take-up. With a 60% payout rate, payout experiences increased
take-up by 10.9 percentage points or 27% of the base rate. The network payout effect
represents 64% of these 10.9 percentage points, larger than the direct payout effect.
This is because the direct effect applies to 40% of the population and for 40% of them
the effect of not receiving a payout is negative. On the other hand, the differential
attention effect due to paying for the insurance is small. However, when payout
rates are either very low or very high, this differential attention effect becomes large
(negative with no payout and positive with a universal payout).

6.2

Validation of the model

Our objective in estimating the joint model is to use the estimated parameters to
conduct policy simulations. The model however was estimated with data from 2
years of insurance purchase, i.e., only one year to infer how observing payouts affect
take-up. Can we apply the model over several years? It could be that observing
payouts only once is important to confirm the understanding of insurance, and then
demand stabilizes to this level. Or that successive observations of payouts and absence
of payouts build the correct evaluation of the insurance through a Bayesian process.
In both cases, the contrasted effects of either payouts or absence of payouts would
decrease over time. To validate our model over a longer period than 2 years, we
simulate the take-up behavior over five consecutive years and compare these with the
observed uptake, using the insurance company’s price policy and the aggregate yearly
payout rate. While we do not have observations at the individual level, we verify in
this section that our model reproduces the observed aggregate take-up, while either
reducing or increasing the previous period payout effects leads to worse fit.

22

The simulations are done on the sub-sample of households for which we have
information on their network and on the network of their network. It includes 3,255
of the 3,474 households used in the estimation.
The steps for the simulation are as follows:
(a)We generate a vector of T random variables (it , t = 1, T ) from a multivariate
normal distribution with correlation ρ̂ for each individual i from the population.
(b) We infer the first year take-up decision for each household i in village j by
comparing the value of Ŵij1 = µˆj + β̂p1 to i1 .
(c) We apply the same expected payout rate to the whole sample, and define the
payout outcome for each insured household by comparing a random number with
uniform distribution to the expected payout rate. We then use this simulated payout
data to calculate the network payout variable for each household. This is a dummy
variable equal to one if the share of insured network households receiving payout is
larger than 50%, and zero otherwise.
(d) Given the first year take-up rate, individual payout, and network payout variables, we then calculate the value of Ŵij2 as defined in equation (12), and infer the
second year take-up decision by comparing the value of Ŵij2 to i2 .
(e) We repeat steps (c) − (d) over the desired number of years.
We use the observed annual average payout rate in 2010-2014. While the 2010
year was exceptional with a payout rate of 58.6%, it was followed by lower rates of
6.1, 15.6, 7, and 31.3% in 2011-2014, respectively. We also use the actual subsidy
policy, denoted S1, with observed prices equal to (3.6, 3.6, 3.6, 4.2, 5.7) RMB/mu
Validation comes from the comparison of simulated and actual take-up rates out of
sample for the years 2012- 2014. The simulation yields yearly take-up rates of 32.8%,
34.7%, and 25.0%, which are similar to the actual aggregate rates of 30%, 35%, and
25-30%, respectively.23 This remarkable similarity in take-up rates helps validate the
model. Furthermore, should we reduce the payout effects by half (setting λ1 to λ8 to
one-half of the estimated parameters), simulated take-up in 2012 would have reached
37.8%, much higher than the observed value. And if we had increased these effects
(by setting λ1 to λ8 to 1.5 times the estimated parameters), the simulated take-up in
23

While we could not obtain the exact take-up from the sample of households that we observed
in 2010 and 2011 for this study, the insurance company gave us an aggregate take-up rate for the
county.

Policy Simulation

In a series of simulations, we confirm that initial subsidy levels have no lasting effect.
Figure IV reports the simulation of three price policies over 5 years:
S2: A constant subsidy policy, with prices equal to 3.6 RMB/mu every year
S3: A one-year-free insurance policy, with prices equal to (0, 3.6, 3.6, 3.6, 3.6) RMB/mu
S4: A two-years-free insurance policy, with prices equal to (0, 0, 3.6, 3.6, 3.6) RMB/mu
These results show that a full subsidy does not affect the take-up rate beyond the year
immediately following the subsidy. Two years after the free offer, take-up is back to where
it would have been without this short-run exceptional subsidy. This finding is in line with
the earlier finding that the larger base effect is counteracted by a lower payout-based learning.
We next address the question of defining the least cost subsidy policy that would insure
a take-up rate of at least 40%. This 40% has been set by the insurance company, which
announced that it would not provide the insurance if the take-up rate were lower than 40%.
This rate reflects the level at which the insurance company would find the insurance to
be financially sustainable. This is an important consideration given the Chinese government’s goal of moving to an ex-ante insurance program to replace informal weather-related
compensation schemes. Such insurance schemes are viable for the insurance company and
beneficial for the farm sector only if there is a sufficient take-up rate. An important finding
from the previous simulations is that, under a constant subsidy (at 3.6 RMB/mu in S2)
take-up rates fluctuate with previous year payout experiences. This suggests that subsidies
need not be very high to ensure a good take-up if the previous year shows a good payout
rate, but may need to be higher if previous payouts are low. Hence a variable subsidy policy
is appropriate to maintain a given take-up rate with minimum subsidy costs. In order to
design such a policy tool, we first establish by simulation the price policy that would ensure
the given take-up rate for a large number of potential payout sequences, and then show that
a reduced form function of lagged variables satisfactorily approximates the policy.
We consider three potential first year price p1 = 0, 1.8, or 3.6 RMB/mu, and four po-

24

tential levels of payout rate for each year, P ayratet = 0, 30, 60, or 100% for t = 1, ...4. For
each of these 768 combinations, we then compute individual take-up and payout in year 1.
From this information, we find by trial and error the price p2 that leads to a 40% aggregate
take-up in year 2. We repeat this process to obtain p3 , p4 , and p5 .
To extract a policy rule from this exercise, we then regress the obtained price in each
year on the previous year’s payout rates and prices:
pkt = β0 + β1 ∗ pk,t−1 + β2 ∗ P ayratek,t−1 + β3 ∗ pk,t−1 ∗ P ayratek,t−1 + kt

(13)

where k indicates one of the 768 (p1 , P ayratet , t = 1, ...4) combinations. Beginning with
year 3, we find similar parameters across years. Consequently, we consider the model stable
from year 3 on and regroup these years.
The results in column (1) of Table IX show that the price and payout rate from the
previous year are sufficient to predict 98% of the price variance for a given year. Adding one
more lag (column (2)) does not improve the prediction accuracy. Column (3) shows some
significant differences across years, but these are always small in magnitude, and don’t show
any particular pattern. Based on these findings, we conclude that simulation results can be
confidently approximated by the simple relationship to the previous year price and payout,
thus providing an easily implementable policy instrument.
The policy rule given by column (1) is represented in Figure V, using again the observed
payout rates. Prices fluctuate, climbing up to 6.2 RMB/mu in year 2 (or 52% of the fair
price) after the very large payout rate of the first year, down to only 1.7 RMB/mu in year 3
after the very low payout rate of the second year. We contrast this with the constant price
policy that would insure the same average take-up during this period. With stable price,
it is the take-up that fluctuates in response to past year payout, from a low 33% to more
than 50%. We compute the annual budget cost as the product of the implied subsidy (the
fair-price 12 RMB/mu less the price charged to buyers) and the take-up. The budgets of
the two policies are mirror images of each other. Under a stable take-up policy, budgets
are high when prices are low, i.e, the year after a low payout rate. Under a stable price
policy, budgets are high when take-up is high, i.e., after a year of high payout rate. There
is therefore no real difference in terms of budgetary impact. The contrast between these
two policies is borne by the farmers with either fluctuating prices or take-up. In practice,
one may want to implement some intermediate subsidy policy that would keep both uptake
and prices fluctuating within acceptable ranges. This would also reduce the fluctuations in
government budgets.
The purpose of the simulation was to demonstrate how one can design a subsidy policy
that insures a steady take-up rate for the insurance through variable subsidy levels that

25

respond to the payout rate of the previous year. While this policy would be quite effective
in insuring a sufficient coverage against weather risk at minimum costs, it may face some
resistance in its implementation because of the year-to-year change in prices charged to
potential customers. There could also be variation in the composition of insurance takers
from year to year, if there is heterogeneity among the population in the sensitivity to price
and payout experience. This rule provides however a benchmark that can be used in the
design of a subsidy policy.

Conclusions

In this paper, we examine the use of subsidies in influencing insurance take-up when subjective valuation of insurance is affected by stochastic experiences. There are many known
channels at play, with both positive and negative effects on the ultimate choice of whether
to purchase insurance in the future. Because these channels act jointly, we integrate them
into a comprehensive model that we use to design an optimum subsidy scheme based on the
goal of achieving a desired stable take-up rate over time.
Specifically, we combine a number of mechanisms through which households update
their belief about the value of insurance: (1) a direct effect from receiving a payout, with
both recency effects from payouts in response to insured shocks and erosion effects from
paying premiums with no payouts; (2) a social effect from observing payouts made to insured
members of one’s social network; (3) an attention effect where greater salience is attributed to
payout events when an individual pays some amount for the insurance; (4) a price anchoring
effect whereby past prices paid impact current willingness to pay for the product; and (5)
a habit formation effect where having held the insurance product in the past may reduce
future transaction costs.
We test the model through a two-year study of the adoption of weather insurance by rice
farmers in China. We use an RCT design to measure the impact of different subsidy levels
on take-up rates, examining the role of each of the above channels in the take-up decision
process. The reduced form estimates show that subsidies are effective in boosting demand,
with take-up increasing from 28% to 60% as the subsidy rate increases from 40% to 90%. The
results also show that participants who pay for their insurance react to receiving a payout
more strongly than those who receive their insurance for free, showing the importance of
price in eliciting attention. We further find that there is a strong discouragement effect when
insurance has been paid for and there is no payout, and that this effect is attenuated by
subsidies. Finally, we find that observing payouts in your network has an effect on take-up
for those who are uninsured and, to a lesser extent, for those who obtained their insurance

26

for free but did not receive a payout. We find no evidence of price anchoring and only a
limited effect of habit formation on take-up rates.
We use the estimated simultaneous demand model that combines the various channels
at play to simulate the outcomes of alternative subsidy schemes. The result suggests that
subsidies need to be continuously adapted based on local recent events to achieve the desired
take-up. For example, a policymaker may choose to price insurance at 51% of the fair price
if the past subsidy and payout rates are 70% and 58.6%, respectively, but to price the
insurance at only 15% of the fair price if the past price and payout rate change to 30% and
6.1%, respectively. In short, a policymaker interested in achieving a desired threshold in
take-up rates at minimum cost should locally differentiate its subsidy levels and carefully
customize these subsidies based on past price policy and past stochastic events.
Since valuation of new technologies and institutions is frequently affected by stochastic
experiences and recency bias, the approach we propose here to the design of smart subsidies
can have wide applicability.
