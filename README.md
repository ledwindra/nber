# About ‚úåüèΩ
Hello world üåè! Are you an economist, or economics student, or just a random person like me who is interested in economics? Do you want to write a paper, a thesis, or just ramble on some stuffs but don't have any fresh ideas on what should be the topic? Worry no more! Because, this repository is for you!

# TL;DR

I migrated all datasets to Dropbox and thus repository size decresases significatnly. Alas, in order to be downloadable, a folder must be less than [20 GB AND has fewer 10,000 total files](https://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/sync-uploads/download-entire-folders). So you have to click `Save to Dropbox` and sync to your local machine. Following are the URLs:
- Paper summary (JSON): [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dx2vbms2zgei7eb/AAA5PsnLBJtQyeEowFxeCMqqa?dl=0 )
- Whole paper (plain text): [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qxzcsj7b72gw9pv/AAB3Gywycgd_DrQYroGipBGAa?dl=0)

# Do it yourself
You can run the codes on your machine by cloning or downloading this repository.

```bash
# if you clone then .git directory will be included on your machine
git clone https://github.com/ledwindra/nber.git
cd nber

# if you download as zip, then .git direcotry won't be included on your machine
# preferable if you don't want to know about the nitty-gritty details about git
wget https://github.com/ledwindra/nber/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip nber-main
cd nber-main 
```

When it's all ready, you may want to use virtual environment before installing all of the required packages so that won't affect your globally installed packages on your machine.

```bash
# create a virtual environment -> .venv is the folder, you can change
python -m venv .venv

# this applies for linux/macos
source .venv/bin/activate

# windows
env/Scripts/activate.bat

# install packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

# Use case
What can be done from this dataset? Well, let's take a look at `/notebook/index.ipynb`. üìô
