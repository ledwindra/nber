This relationship has been called the out a simple and straight-forward static model of the microfoundations of the pollution-income relationship.  We show that the environmental Kuznets curve can be derived directly from the technological link between consumption of a desired good and abatement of its  undesirable byproduct.  The inverse-U shape does not depend on the dynamics of growth, political institutions, or even externalities, and can be consistent with a decentralized economy as well as a Pareto efficient policy.\n\n",
