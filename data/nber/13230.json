    "abstract": "\n\nLegal rules governing the employer-employee relationship are many and varied.  Economic analysis has illuminated both the efficiency and the effects on employee welfare of such rules, as described in this paper.  Topics addressed include workplace safety mandates, compensation systems for workplace injuries, privacy protection in the workplace, employee fringe benefits mandates, targeted mandates such as medical and family leave, wrongful discharge laws, unemployment insurance systems, minimum wage rules, and rules requiring that employees receive overtime pay.  Both economic theory and empirical evidence are considered.\n\n",
