    "abstract": "\n\nMany, if not most, personalistic dictatorships end up with a disastrous decision such as Hitler\u2019s attack on the Soviet Union, Hirohito\u2019s government launching a war against the United States, or Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Even if the decision is not ultimately fatal for the regime, such as Mao\u2019s Big Leap Forward or the Pol Pot\u2019s collectivization drive, they typically involve both a monumental miscalculation and an institutional environment in which better-informed subordinates have no chance to prevent the decision from being implemented. We offer a dynamic model of non-democratic politics, in which repression and bad decision-making are self-reinforcing. Repressions reduce the threat, yet raise the stakes for the incumbent; with higher stakes, the incumbent puts more emphasis on loyalty than competence. Our theory sheds light on the mechanism of disastrous individual decisions in highly institutionalized authoritarian regimes.\n\n",
