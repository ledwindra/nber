    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper constructs a tractable general equilibrium model of search with risk-aversion.  An increase in risk-aversion reduces wages, unemployment, and investment.  Unemployment insurance (UI) has the reverse effect due to market generated moral hazard: insured workers seek high wage jobs with high unemployment risk. An economy with risk-neutral workers achieves maximal output without any UI.  In contrast, in an economy with risk-averse workers, a positive level of UI maximizes output.  Therefore, moderate UI not only improves risk-sharing, but also increases output.\n\n",
