Non-linear Effects of Taxation on Growth

JEL No. H2,O4
ABSTRACT
We propose a model consistent with two observations. First, the tax rates adopted by different countries
are generally uncorrelated with their growth performance. Second, countries that drastically reduce
private incentives to invest, severely hurt their growth performance. In our model, the effects of taxation
on growth are highly non-linear. Low or moderate tax rates have a very small impact on long-run growth
rates. But as tax rates rise, their negative impact on growth rises dramatically. The median voter chooses
tax rates that have a small impact on growth prospects, making the relation between tax rates and economic
growth difficult to measure empirically.

Introduction

The 20th century provided two important observations on the determinants of longrun growth. The first observation is that the tax rates adopted by di§erent countries
are generally uncorrelated with their growth performance. So, are incentives to invest
irrelevant for long-run growth?
The second observation is that countries that drastically reduce private incentives
to innovate and invest severely hurt their growth performance. One salient example
is the performance of China between 1949, when communists took over and abolished
property rights, and the introduction of reforms by Deng Xiaoping in 1979. Another
prominent example is the performance of India under the “permit raj”that lasted from
1947 until the reforms introduced by Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao in 1984 and
1991, respectively. Interestingly, when these countries gradually restored modest incentives to invest, growth rates increased dramatically.1 Here, incentives to invest seem to
matter for growth.
To reconcile these two observations, we propose a model where the e§ects of taxation
on growth are highly non-linear. Low or moderate tax rates have a small impact on
long-run growth rates. But, as tax rates and other disincentives to investment rise,
their negative impact on growth rises dramatically.
To explain the source of this non-linearity, it is useful to describe the structure of our
model. We combine the growth model proposed by Romer (1990) with the Lucas (1978)
model of occupational choice. As in Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991),
and Aghion and Howitt (1992), growth comes from innovation. As in Lucas (1978), the

Ahluwalia (2002) discusses the gradualist approach to reform followed by India. McMillan, Whalley
and Zhu (1989) and McMillan and Naughton (1992) discuss the gradual reforms introduced in China
and their impact on productivity. In China and India, reforms took place in an environment of political
and institutional stability. In contrast, countries from the ex-Soviet block often adopted a “big-bang”
approach to reform that created substantial political and institutional turmoil that was generally
associated with poor economic performance. See McMillan and Naughton (1992) for a comparison of
the reforms in China and in the ex-Soviet block.

economy is populated by agents who di§er in their ability as entrepreneurs/innovators.
These agents decide optimally whether to become workers or innovators. Innovators
earn profits from their patents and these profits are subject to capital-income taxation.
Motivated by the plethora of evidence on the presence of right skewness in the
distribution of patents, scientific-paper citations, income, and profits, we assume that
the distribution of entrepreneurial ability is skewed. Because of this skewness, most
of the innovation in our economy comes from a small number of highly-productive
innovators, the Bill Gates and Steve Jobs of the model.
Increasing the capital-income tax rate reduces incentives to be an entrepreneur and
generates exit from the innovation sector. But, since the marginal innovator is much
less productive than the average innovator, this exit has a small impact on the growth
performance of the economy. In other words, the top entrepreneurs in our model are so
productive that they are not deterred from innovating by low-to-moderate tax rates. As
a result, there is a range of tax rates that are associated with similar growth outcomes.
When taxes and other disincentives to innovate become high, high-quality entrepreneurs
exit and the growth engine stalls.
We use our model economy to compute the capital-income tax rate chosen by the
median voter and by a benevolent planner. We first show that even when the median
voter is a worker, he chooses a tax rate on capital income on the flat region of the
function relating the tax rate to the growth rate. The reason for this choice is that
workers benefit from growth in wages that results from the innovation process and
understand that high taxes would severely reduce growth prospects.
Our model implies that punitive tax rates are unlikely to be adopted for extended
periods of time in well-functioning democracies or, more generally, in political regimes
whose decision makers value growth more than preserving the status quo or maintaining
political control.2 The optimal choices made by the median voter in our model generate

The Swedish experience in the 1970s illustrates the impact of public discourse on tax policy. Astrid
Lindgren, a successful writer of children’s books, published a satirical story about the adverse incentive

2

a censored sample where the observed variation in tax rates has a small impact on
growth. So, the model is consistent with the absence of a strong correlation between tax
rates and growth that we observe in the data. One important implication of the model
is that the lack of correlation between taxes and growth is not a global property that
holds for all tax rates, but rather an artifact of the endogenous nature of taxation: tax
rates that are highly detrimental to the growth process are generally not implemented.
We relate our model to the recent work of Diamond and Saez (2011) who argue
that the optimal marginal income tax rate for high-income individuals is 73 percent.
We argue that the Diamond-Saez calculation su§ers from an important shortcoming:
it considers only the static e§ect of taxation on current tax revenue. Implicitly, this
calculation ignores dynamic e§ects, that is, changes in the growth rate resulting from
changes in tax rates. In our model these dynamic e§ects are small and can be safely
ignored when tax rates are low. But it is exactly when tax rates are high, in the
range recommended by Diamond and Saez (2011), that these dynamic e§ects become
important.
There are three models consistent with our observation that tax rates are uncorrelated with long-run growth rates: the neoclassical growth model, the Lucas (1988)
model, and the Jones (1999) model. In all three models, capital-income taxes or other
disincentives to investment do not a§ect the steady-state growth rate. In the neoclassical model, this rate is determined by the pace of exogenous technical progress.3 In
the Lucas (1988) model, the engine of growth is the accumulation of human capital.
The costs (foregone wages) and benefits (higher future wages) of this accumulation
are a§ected by income taxes in the same proportion. As a result, the growth rate is
e§ects of the punishingly high tax rates levied by Sweden. Her story sparked a public debate that is
generally credited with leading to the first electoral defeat of the Social Democratic Party in 40 years
and to the reform of the tax code.
3
In the neoclassical model, taxes can a§ect growth through transition dynamics. However, versions
of the neoclassical model in which these dynamics are important tend to imply that the real interest
rate takes implausibly high values. See King and Rebelo (1993) for a discussion.

independent of the income tax rate.4 In the semi-endogenous growth model proposed
by Jones (1999), the externalities from the innovation process are not strong enough
to make growth sustainable. Sustained growth is feasible only when the population
grows, and the steady-state growth rate is proportional to the growth rate of population. So, the only channel for taxes to influence growth is through their e§ect on the
determinants of population growth.5
These models have, in our view, two shortcomings. First, they are inconsistent with
the observation that modest improvements in the incentives to invest, in economies
with high disincentives to invest, can produce large growth e§ects. Second, they imply
that long-run growth rates remain constant even when tax rates approach 100 percent.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review and update the evidence
on the empirical correlation between tax rates and growth rates. In Section 3, we
present our model. In Section 4, we discuss the model’s implications for the e§ects of
taxes on growth. In Section 5, we analyze the capital-income tax rates that the median
voter and benevolent social planner would choose. We also discuss the implications
of our model for the optimal income tax calculations proposed by Diamond and Saez
(2011). Section 6 concludes.

Empirical evidence on taxation and growth

In this section, we briefly review and update the evidence on the correlation between
taxation and growth. We discuss evidence both from cross-country studies and from
U.S. time-series analyses.
4

Stokey and Rebelo (1995) and Mendoza, Milesi-Ferretti, and Asea (1997) discuss variants of the
Lucas (1988) model which, for certain parameter configurations, produce a small impact of taxes on
long-run growth. These variants include models in which labor supply is endogenous and physical
capital is an input to human capital accumulation.
5
Arnold (1998) incorporates human capital accumulation into a Jones (1999)-style growth model.
The resulting model generates sustained growth in the absence of population growth. Since human
capital accumulation is the growth engine of the economy, Arnold (1998)’s model inherits the properties
of the Lucas model in terms of the e§ects of taxation on growth.

4

Cross-country studies Easterly and Rebelo (1993) study a cross section of 125
countries for the period 1970 to 1988. Their main finding is that the correlation between
various tax rate measures and growth performance is surprisingly fragile. They show
that, while it is possible to select specifications for which taxes are negatively correlated
with growth, this correlation is not robust to the inclusion of other controls or to changes
in the sample composition.
Mendoza, Razin, and Tesar (1994) find no correlation between tax rates and growth
rates in their study of panel data for 18 OECD countries. Similarly, Piketty, Saez, and
Stantcheva (2014) find no correlation between growth rates and the changes in marginal
income tax rates that have been implemented in OECD countries since 1975.
U.S. time-series analyses Stokey and Rebelo (1995) argue that it is hard to detect a negative growth impact of the rise in income tax rates implemented in the U.S.
after World War II. Before the Sixteenth Amendment was approved in 1913, the U.S.
Constitution severely restricted the ability of the federal government to levy income
taxes. Even after the approval of the Sixteenth Amendment, federal income-tax revenue remained low, representing less than 2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
between 1913 and 1940. Federal income tax revenue as a percentage of GDP rose to
15 percent by the early 1940s. Despite this increase, Stokey and Rebelo (1995) find
that the average U.S. growth rate before and after World War II are not statistically
di§erent. These results were anticipated by Harberger (1964), who observed that U.S.
growth rates have been invariant to changes in the tax structure.6
Jones (1995) makes the more general point that changes in policy variables tend
to be permanent, but growth rates tend to be stationary. In related work, Easterly,
Kremer, Pritchett and Summers (1993) show that persistence across decades is low for
growth rates but high for policy variables. This finding suggests that caution is needed
6

We cannot, of course, rule out the possibility that, by coincidence, other forces o§set exactly the
e§ects of the tax hikes implemented in the post-war period, leaving the growth rate unchanged.

5

in attributing high growth rates to good policies, such as low tax rates.
In recent work, Romer and Romer (2010, 2014) use the “narrative record” on the
motivation of tax policy changes in the post-war period to identify changes that are
exogenous, in the sense that they are not a response to the growth prospects of the
economy. Their paper focuses on the short-run e§ect of taxes on output. They find
that, in the post-war period, a tax increase of 1 percent of GDP implies a 3 percent
fall in output. Importantly, the authors assume in their empirical work that permanent
changes in taxes a§ect output only temporarily and have no impact on the long-run
growth rate of the economy.7
Revisiting the correlation between taxation and growth To revisit and update
the empirical work on taxation and growth, we use the method proposed by Mendoza,
Razin, and Tesar (1994) to construct measures of tax rates on capital and labor income
for OECD countries for the period 1965-2010.
The first two columns of Table 1 report results for cross-sectional regressions. The
dependent variable is the average annual growth rate of real per capita GDP. The
independent variables are our labor and capital tax-rate measures. As column 1 shows,
neither labor- nor capital-income taxes have a statistically significant impact on growth.
Column 2 includes controls commonly used in the growth literature (see e.g. Barro
(2012)).8 Here too, the tax variables are statistically insignificant.
The second two columns of Table 1 shows the results for panel regressions using fiveyear growth rates and five-year averages of the independent variables. All regressions
have time and country fixed e§ects. Column one shows that the coe¢cients on both
tax variables are statistically significant. However, the sign of the labor income tax rate

Romer and Romer (2010) shocks, as well as a discussion of the related literature.

These variables are: the logarithm of lagged per capita GDP, 1/life expectancy at birth, the
logarithm of fertility, the investment share in GDP, male and female school years, the government
consumption share in GDP, the openness ratio, and the inflation rate.

6

is positive. Once we include controls (column 4), the coe¢cient on labor and capital
taxes become insignificant.9
We interpret the weight of the evidence gathered so far and our updated results as
suggesting that there is no strong association between the tax rates adopted by di§erent
countries and their growth performance. This body of evidence is consistent with the
possibility that taxes might have important level e§ects or create large deadweight
losses. Higher tax rates might, for example, induce agents to work less, as emphasized by
Prescott (2004), or to reallocate e§ort from market activities towards home production,
as emphasized by Sandmo (1990). But the evidence is inconsistent with the implication,
shared by many endogenous growth models, that the observed changes in capital and
labor taxes have large growth e§ects.10

3

Model

We consider a Romer (1990)-style model in which growth is driven by innovation that
expands the variety of intermediate inputs. Agents choose whether to be workers or
entrepreneurs, as in Lucas (1978). We focus our analysis on the e§ect of capital-income
taxes on the growth rate of the economy.
Importantly, we assume that agents have di§erent entrepreneurial ability and that
this ability follows a Pareto distribution. As we discuss below, this assumption is
consistent with evidence that the right tail of the U.S. income distribution is well
described by the Pareto distribution (see e.g. Diamond and Saez (2011)). It is also
consistent with the presence of right skewness in the cross-sectional distribution of
profits from innovation, returns to entrepreneurship, and research productivity.11 Our
9

One concern with these regressions is that changes in tax rates might be driven by the economy’s
growth prospects. In the Appendix, we explore two approaches to address this endogeneity problem.
10
See Jones and Manuelli (1990), Barro (1990), Rebelo (1991), and Stokey and Rebelo (1995) for
examples of models that share this implication.
11
Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) document the presence of skewness in the returns to
entrepreneurial activity. Scherer (1998) and Grabowski (2002) show that a small number of firms

7

assumption that ability is a key driver of skewness in economic performance is motivated
by the work of Huggett, Ventura and Yaron (2011) and Keane and Wolpin (1997) who
find that di§erences in individual ability are a key source of heterogeneity in economic
outcomes.12

where pi is the price of intermediate good i, w is the wage rate, and τ is the capitalincome tax rate. Both pi and w are denominated in units of the final good. The

account for a disproportionate fraction of the profits from innovation. Harho§, Scherer, and Vopel
(2003), Bertran (2003), Hall, Ja§e, and Trajtenberg (2005), and Silverberg and Verspagen (2007)
show that the distribution of patent values and patent citations is highly skewed. Hall, Ja§e, and
Trajtenberg (2005) show that almost half of all patents receive zero or one citation and less than 0.1
percent of total patents receive more than 100 cites. Lotka (1926) and Cox and Chung (1991) show
that the distribution of scientific publications per author is skewed. Redner (1998) finds similar results
for the distribution of citations to scientific papers.
12
Recent papers that consider entrepreneurial ability as a major source of heterogeneity include
Buera, Kaboski, and Shin (2011), and Midrigan and Xu (2014).

8

Intermediate good producers/innovators Innovators own permanent patents on
the production of intermediate goods. Each unit of the intermediate good, xi , is produced with η units of the final good. The after-tax profit flow, π i , generated by each
new good is given by:
π i = (pi − η) xi (1 − τ ).

(3)

Since all producers choose the same price and quantity, we eliminate the subscript
i in what follows. Equations (1) and (3) imply that the optimal price and quantity
produced by the innovator are:

The maximal after-tax profit per patent is given by:
π = α(1 − α)(2−α)/α η −(1−α)/α L(1 − τ ).

(5)

When we optimize the use of intermediate goods in the production of final goods, we
obtain a reduced-form production function that is linear in labor. This result, together
with the fact that p is constant, implies that the wage rate does not depend on L.
This property greatly simplifies our analysis. Equations (2) and (4) imply that the
equilibrium wage rate equals:
wt = αnt

(6)

For future reference, we note that this equation implies that the wage rate grows at the
same rate as nt .

3.2

Government

The government rebates tax revenue back to agents in a lump-sum manner. Profits
gross of taxes are: (nt π + π f )/(1 − τ ). Tax revenue is given by: τ (nt π + π f )/(1 − τ ).
9

The budget constraint of the government is:
nt π + π f
Tt = τ
,
1−τ
where Tt denotes lump-sum transfers to the agents in the economy.

3.3

The agent’s problem

The economy is populated by H infinitely lived agents with identical preferences. Agents
di§er in their entrepreneurial ability, a, which follows a cumulative distribution Γ(a).
To simplify, we assume that individuals with identical ability have the same initial stock
of patents and that all agents have zero initial bond holdings. Under these assumptions,
the only source of heterogeneity in the economy is the agent’s ability.
The utility of an agent with entrepreneurial ability a, U (a), is given by:
Z 1
Ct (a)1−σ − 1
dt,
e−ρt
U (a) =
1−σ
0

(7)

where Ct (a) denotes the agent’s consumption.
In each period, agents choose whether to work in the final-goods sector and receive
the real wage rate, wt , or become innovators. An agent with ability a who becomes
an entrepreneur invents δant new goods and obtains a permanent patent on these
inventions.13
The budget constraint of an agent with ability a is given:
ḃt (a) = rt bt (a) + wt lt (a) + mt (a)π t + π ft /H − Ct (a) + Tt /H,
and
lim e−

t!1

Rt
0

rs ds

(8)

bt (a) = 0,

where bt (a) denotes the agent’s bond holdings and rt the real interest rate.
13

We describe in the Appendix an alternative decentralization in which R&D firms hire innovators
in competitive labor markets. The resulting allocations are identical to this model.

10

The variable lt (a) is equal to 1 if the agent chooses to be a worker in period t and
zero, otherwise. The variable mt (a) denotes the number of patents owned by an agent
with entrepreneurial ability a at time t. The law of motion for mt (a) is given by:
ṁt (a) = δant [1 − lt (a)] .

(9)

This equation implies that workers receive no new patents, while innovators increase
in the stock of patents they hold. As is common in this class of models, there is an
externality in the sense that, the larger the value of nt , the easier it is to invent new
goods. This externality is essential to make sustained growth feasible.
The model generates surprisingly complex borrowing and lending dynamics which
we describe in the Appendix.14 But, since preferences are consistent with Gorman
aggregation, the growth rate of the economy is independent of these borrowing and
lending dynamics.
Occupational choice and equilibrium We show in the Appendix that the equilibrium of this economy is characterized by a threshold rule. Agents with ability a ≥ a∗

always work as entrepreneurs, while the rest always work in the final goods sector. So,
the number of workers in the final-good sector is given by:
L = HΓ(a∗ ).

(10)

and the growth rate and real interest rate are constant. Thus, the patent’s value V , is:
π
V = .
r
∗
The threshold ability a that makes agents indi§erent between being a worker or an
entrepreneur is given by:15
a∗ δnt

π
= wt .
r

14

(11)

These dynamics arise because, depending on the initial patent holdings and occupational choices,
some agents have incomes growing faster or slower than the aggregate economy’s growth rate. In the
limit, income growth for all agents converges to the growth rate of the economy.
15
There is evidence that income prospects and taxation influence career choices. For example, Philippon and Reshef (2012) show that, when finance was heavily regulated, profits and labor compensation

The number of varieties in the economy, nt , evolves according to:

We show in the Appendix that the growth rate of the economy, g, coincides with the
growth rate of nt ,
g = δH

a∗

Since all agents face the same real interest rate, their consumption grows at the
same rate, which coincides with the growth rate of the economy, g. The first-order
conditions for the consumer problem imply:
(13)

r = ρ + σg

Combining equations (5), (6), (10), (11) (12), and (13), we obtain the following
equation, which determines a∗ :

Once we obtain the value of a∗ , we can compute the growth rate of the economy
using equation (12).

The e§ect of taxes on growth

In order to study the e§ect of taxes on growth, we need to specify the distribution
of entrepreneurial ability, Γ(a). Our choice is guided by the work of Diamond and
Saez (2011) which shows that the right tail of the U.S. income distribution follows a
were low. As a result, high-skill individuals did not work in the financial industry. Deregulation led
to higher profits and wages, attracting high-skill individuals to finance. Cullen and Gordon (2002) use
U.S. individual tax return data to show that di§erences in tax rates on business versus wage income
have large e§ects on the choice to become an entrepreneur.

12

Pareto distribution. Since entrepreneurial income is proportional to ability, our model
is consistent with the evidence provided by Diamond and Saez (2011).
Given this distributional assumption, the growth rate of the economy is given by:
g = δH

k
ak (a∗ )1−k ,
k−1

(15)

where k is the shape parameter, a is the lower bound of the Pareto distribution, and
a∗ satisfies (14) which in turn can be written as:

Comparing an heterogenous- and homogeneous-ability economy In order to
isolate the role of heterogeneity in ability in our model, it is useful to compare an
economy with heterogeneous ability with one where ability is homogeneous (a = 1 for
all agents). In the homogeneous-ability economy, all agents are indi§erent in equilibrium between being workers and entrepreneurs so the free entry condition into the
entrepreneurial sector is:
δnt π
= wt ,
r
and the growth rate of the economy is given by:
g=

δH(1 − α)(1 − τ ) − ρ
,
(1 − α)(1 − τ ) + σ

implying that the e§ect of a tax change on the growth rate of the economy is given by

Consider two economies, one with heterogenous ability and the other with homogeneousability. To simplify the comparison, suppose that the two economies have the same
structural parameters α and ρ, and the same tax rate, τ . Moreover the size of the
population is each economy is such that they both grow at the same rate g.
Comparing equations (17) and (19), we find that the di§erence in the impact of
taxation on growth on the two economies results from θ. When k is finite, the value
of a∗ is greater than a since, otherwise, there would be no workers, no final-goods
production, and patents would have no value. Since a∗ > a, the value of θ is greater
than one. This property implies that the impact of taxation on growth is always smaller
in the heterogenous-ability model than in the homogeneous-ability model.
As we discuss in the introduction, the intuition for this result is that in the heterogenousability economy, the marginal innovator is much less productive than the average innovator. So, the exit of the marginal entrepreneurs in response to a tax rise has a smaller
growth e§ect than in the homogenous-ability economy, where the marginal innovator
is as productive as the average innovator.
Numerical example We use a numerical example to illustrate the e§ects of changes
in the capital-income tax rate in economies with homogeneous and heterogenous ability.
The following parameterization is shared by both economies. We set the labor share
in the production of final goods to 60 percent (α = 0.60). We assume that σ = 2
and we choose ρ = 0.01, so that the annual real interest rate in an economy with no
growth is one percent. Without loss of generality, we normalize δ and η to one. Finally,
in both the homogeneous and heterogenous case, we choose the value of H so that,
when τ = 0.3, the growth rate of the economy is 2 percent per year. This value of τ
corresponds to the average capital-income tax rate in the U.S., computed as the tax
revenue divided by the base. We normalize the value of a to one and choose k = 1.5.
This choice of k implies that the right tail of the income distribution implied by the
model is the same as that estimated by Diamond and Saez (2011) for the U.S. economy.
14

The first panel of Figure 1 shows the e§ect of changes in τ on the growth rate of
the two economies. In the homogenous-ability model, the growth rate of the economy
is approximately linear in τ . The growth rate ranges from 2.9 percent, when τ = 0,
to zero when τ = 0.87. Doubling the capital-income tax rate from 30 to 60 percent,
halves the growth rate from 2 percent to 1 percent. Higher taxes reduce the incentives
to innovation, reducing the number of entrepreneurs. Since all agents in the economy
are equally good at being entrepreneurs, this reduction has a large impact on the rate
of growth.
In the heterogeneous-ability model, the growth rate is a non-linear function of the
tax rate. The growth rate ranges from 2.2 percent, when τ = 0, to zero when τ =
1. Doubling the tax rate from 30 to 60 percent reduces the growth rate from 2 to
1.65 percent. This reduction is much smaller than that implied by the homogeneousability model (from 2 to 1 percent). The impact of taxation is highly non-linear in the
heterogenous-ability economy: increasing τ from 60 to 79 percent reduces the growth
rate by as much as doubling τ from 30 to 60 percent.
The second panel of Figure 1 depicts the fraction of entrepreneurs in the population
for di§erent values of τ . In the homogeneous-ability model, this fraction ranges from 15
percent, when τ = 0 to zero when τ = 0.87. The strong, negative e§ect of taxes on the
number of entrepreneurs is at the core of the homogenous agents model’s large impact
of taxation on growth. In contrast, in the heterogeneous ability model the fraction of
agents who choose to be entrepreneurs ranges from 5.2 percent, when τ = 0, to zero
when τ = 1. As τ rises, the number of entrepreneurs declines roughly linearly. But the
impact on growth is highly nonlinear, because the ability of the entrepreneurs who exit
rises with τ .

The Median Voter and the Social Planner

In this section, we analyze the capital-income tax rates that the median voter and a
benevolent social planer would choose for our economy. We conclude this section by
relating our findings to the recent work of Diamond and Saez (2011) on the optimal
income tax rate for high-income individuals.

5.1

Median voter

We analyze an economy in which the median voter is a worker and workers own no
patents at time zero. This case provides an upper bound on the tax rate chosen by
the median voter for two reasons. First, if workers held some patents, they would
have less of an incentives to tax capital income. Second, if the median worker was an
entrepreneur, he would choose a lower tax rate than a worker, since he receives capital
income. A median voter who is an entrepreneur might choose a positive capital-income
tax rate in order to redistribute income from high-ability to low-ability entrepreneurs.
A worker who is the median voter faces the following tradeo§. On the one hand,
higher capital-income taxes result in higher tax revenue and higher lump-sum transfers
in the short run, which benefit workers. On the other hand, higher taxes lead to lower
growth in wages in the long run, which hurts workers.
Computing life-time utility Since the consumption of both workers and entrepreneurs grow at a constant rate, we can re-write lifetime utility, defined in equation (7),
as:

C01−σ
U=
1−σ

Z

0

1

exp {[−ρ + (1 − σ)g] t} dt.

Assuming that (1 − σ)g < ρ, so that lifetime utility is finite, the value of U is given by:
C01−σ
U=
.
ρ(1 − σ) − (1 − σ)2 g

16

(20)

As we show in the Appendix, the time-zero consumption of workers is given by:
C0 = w0 +

τ π
r−g
n0 +
πm0 (a), a < a∗ ,
1−τ H
r

(21)

The tradeo§ faced by the median voter is clear from equations (20) and (21). A
higher tax rate benefits workers since it increases the lump-sum transfer they receive
from the government (the term [τ /(1 − τ )] (π/H) n0 in equation (21)). At the same

time, a higher tax rate reduces the growth rate and lowers utility by reducing the
denominator in equation (20).
Median voter’s preferred tax rate The tax rate that maximizes the utility of the
median voter for the parameters considered in Section 3 is 35 percent. We find this
result interesting for two reasons. First, this tax rate is very close to the average capitalincome tax rate, computed as the tax revenue divided by the base, which is roughly 30
percent. Second, the tax rate chosen by the median voter suggests that democracies
are unlikely to choose tax rates that are very detrimental to growth prospects. When τ
is equal to 35 percent, the economy grows at an annual rate of 1.95 percent. Reducing
the capital-income tax rate to zero would increase the growth rate only to 2.25 percent.
The fact that the median voter avoids implementing tax rates that lead to poor
growth prospects has important implications for the samples used to study the empirical
relation between taxation and growth. These samples are censored in the sense that
they generally don’t contain the full range of values of τ . Instead, they contain values
of τ on the flat region of the function relating the tax rate to the growth rate, making
the relation between taxation and growth hard to detect.
Figure 2 shows the ratio of the initial consumption that would make the median
voter indi§erent between an arbitrary tax rate τ and the consumption at the tax rate
that maximizes his welfare. This figure illustrates that the e§ects of taxation on welfare
are highly non-linear, with high rates of taxes being associated with low levels of welfare.

17

5.2

Social Planner

We now consider a social planner who chooses the tax rate to maximize a weighted
average of the utility of workers and entrepreneurs:

Recall that consumption of both workers and entrepreneurs grows at rate g. The timezero consumption of workers is given by equation (21). As we show in the appendix,
the time-zero consumption of entrepreneurs is given by:
#
"
τ 1
r − g m0 (a) δa
+
, a ≥ a∗ .
+
C0 = πn0
r

r
1−τ H

(22)

For the parameters considered in Section 3, the value of τ that maximizes Ū is 31
percent. We choose the initial distribution of patents so that the social planner has a
strong redistribution motive. As in the case of the median voter, we assume that workers
do not own any initial patents. In addition, we distribute initial patents equally among
the top 1 percent of entrepreneurs ranked by ability. The tax rate chosen by the social
planner is basically identical if the initial patents are distributed equally among the top
2 or 3 percent of entrepreneurs ranked by ability.
Since the planner places a positive weight on the welfare of the entrepreneurs, he
always chooses a lower tax rate than the worker. The tax rate selected by the social
planner is remarkably close to the U.S. capital-income tax rate.

5.3

Relation to the modern public finance literature

The tax rates chosen by the median voter and the social planner in our model are much
lower than the optimal tax rates advocated in the modern public finance literature.
For example, Diamond and Saez (2011) argue that the optimal income tax rate for
high-income individuals is 73 percent. This high optimal tax rate results from the fact

18

that high-income individuals have a low elasticity of taxable income with respect to the
tax rate.
The Diamond-Saez calculation su§ers from an important shortcoming. It considers
only the static e§ect of taxation on current tax revenue. It ignores dynamic e§ects by
implicitly assuming that the growth rate of the economy is invariant with respect to
the tax rate. In our model, these dynamic e§ects are indeed small and can be safely
ignored when tax rates are low. But it is exactly when tax rates become high, in the
range recommended by Diamond and Saez (2011), that these dynamic e§ects become
significant.16
To see this problem, suppose the government adopts very high tax rates. The static
e§ects of this action is positive for the workers: their wage remains the same and they
see a rise in the lump-sum transfers they receive from the government. But the dynamic
e§ects can be disastrous for worker’s welfare, since higher taxes lead to a fall in the
growth rate of wages. We can use our model to illustrate how misleading the focus on
the static e§ects of taxation can be. Total pre-tax income in the economy is given by:
wt HΓ(a∗ ) + nt

πt
.
1−τ

An increase in τ leads to a rise in pre-tax income. To see this result, note that the
derivative of pre-tax income with respect to τ is given by:
wt HΓ0 (a∗ )

da∗
d [π t /(1 − τ )]
+ nt
> 0.
dτ
dτ

(23)

This expression reflects the fact that the wage rate is solely a function of nt (see
equation (2)). Since nt is fixed in the short run, wt is not a§ected by an increase in τ .
16

Scheuer (2014) discusses another shortcoming of the Diamond-Saez calculation: it implicitly assumes that tax-driven changes in the labor supply of high-income individuals do not a§ect the productivity of other agents in the economy. Scheuer (2014) illustrates this issue in a model in which
the labor supply of entrepreneurs and workers are complements, so reductions in the entrepreneurial
labor supply lead to a decline in the productivity of workers. Our model embodies a natural source of
complementarity between entrepreneurs and workers.

19

As the tax rate rises, the ability threshold also rises (da∗ /dτ > 0), and some entrepreneurs become workers. So, the first term in equation (23) is positive. The second
term is also positive because a rise in the number of workers leads to a rise in pre-tax
profits (see equation (5)).
Since the short-run response of pre-tax income to the tax rate is positive, the tax
rate that maximizes short-run tax revenue is 100 percent! A planner who considers
only the static e§ects of taxation would choose a high tax rate in order to redistribute
income from the entrepreneurs to the workers in order to equalize their marginal utility.
But this choice would be misguided since it ignores the impact of taxation on growth
which is a key driver of welfare.

6

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a model in which the e§ects of taxation on growth are
highly non-linear. Taxes have a small impact on long-run growth when taxes rates
and other disincentives to investment are low or moderate. But, as tax rates rise,
the marginal impact of taxation on growth also rises. This non-linearity is generated
by heterogeneity in entrepreneurial ability. In a low-tax economy, the ability of the
marginal entrepreneur is relatively low. So, increasing the tax rate leads to the exit
of low-ability entrepreneurs and to a small decline in the growth rate. In a high-tax
economy the ability of the marginal entrepreneur is relatively high. So, increasing the
tax rate leads to the exit of high-ability entrepreneurs and in a large decline in the
growth rate.

8.1

Endogeneity of changes in tax rates

One concern with the regressions reported in Table 1 is that changes in tax rates might
be driven by the economy’s growth prospects. We explore two approaches to address
this endogeneity problem. The first approach is to instrument for tax rates with the
lagged debt-GDP ratio. This approach is motivated by the observation that tax rate
increases often result from the need to service the public debt. For example, the tax
hikes implemented by many countries after World War II were not a reaction to their
growth prospects. Instead, they resulted from the need to service the debt accumulated
during the war years. We report the results from using this approach in Table 1A.18 In
all cases, we find that the tax coe¢cients are insignificant.
In our second approach, we separate increases in tax rates from decreases in tax
rates. The motivation for this approach is as follows. It is easy to find instances in
which policy makers reduce tax rates to improve poor growth prospects. But it is much
harder to find instances in which policymakers decide to raise taxes because growth
prospects are too bright. So, tax increases are likely to be more exogenous to growth
prospects than tax decreases. Table 2A reports results for regressions of the change in
the growth rate on increases and decreases in tax rates. The first and second column
show results without and with controls respectively. In both cases, the coe¢cients on
tax variables are statistically insignificant.

18

Since we have only one instrument, the tax variables are included in the regression one at a time.

Solving the agent’s problem

We solve the agent’s problem in two steps. First, we maximize the agent’s wealth.
Second, we choose the optimal consumption path given the maximal level of wealth.
Integrating equation (8), we obtain:

(24)

where the left-hand side is the wealth of the agent and the right-hand side is the
present value of the agent’s consumption. The wealth maximization problem can then
be written as:

ws ls (a) + ms (a) π s + π fs /H + Tt ds,

subject to equation (9). The Hamiltonian for this problem is:

H =wt lt (a) + mt (a) π t + π ft /H + Tt + Vt (a)δant [1 − lt (a)] ,
where Vt (a), the Lagrange multiplier associated with the law of motion for mt (a), is
the value of a patent. We proceed by analyzing the three first-order conditions of the
problem.
The first-order condition with respect to mt (a) is:
V̇t (a) = rt Vt (a) − π t .
Solving this di§erential equation, we obtain
Z 1
Rj
π j e− t rs ds dj,
Vt =

t

where we omit the subscript a because the value of Vt is the same for all agents. Equation
(25) implies that the value of a patent for a new good is the discounted value of the
profit flow associated with the patent.

30

The first-order condition with respect to lt (a) implies that there is a threshold
ability, a∗ , that makes agents indi§erent between being a worker or an entrepreneur:
a∗ δnt Vt = wt .

(26)

Agents with ability greater (lower) than a∗ choose to become entrepreneurs (workers).
Finally, we note that the first-order condition for the consumer problem implies:
Ċt (a)
rt − ρ
=

Ct (a)
σ

(27)

Since all agents face the same real interest rate, their consumption grows at the same
rate. We denote this growth rate by g.

Consumption and bond holdings

worker’s lifetime budget constraint is given by:

Entrepreneur’s consumption Recall that the law of motion for the patents of an
entrepreneur with ability a is:
ṁt (a) = δant = δan0 egt , a > a∗ .
Integrating this equation, we obtain:
mt (a) = m0 (a) +

This equation implies that entrepreneurs whose initial stock of patents is greater (lower)
than n0 δa/g are lenders (borrowers). Entrepreneurs with an initial stock of patents
equal to n0 δa/g have zero bond holdings. To understand these patterns, it is useful to
integrate equation (9):
mt (a) = m0 (a) +

δan0 gt
(e − 1), a ≥ a∗ .
g

Recall that the entrepreneur’s time-t income is: mt (a)π, where π is constant (see
equation (5)). When m0 (a) = n0 δa/g, entrepreneurial income grows at the same rate
as consumption, so the entrepreneur does not need to use bond markets to make his
consumption stream consistent with his income stream. When m0 < n0 δa/g entrepreneurial income grows faster than g, and so entrepreneurs borrow against future income.
When m0 > n0 δa/g, entrepreneurial income grows slower than g and so entrepreneurs
lend in order to consume more than their income in the future.
With the appropriate modification of the problem, we can also obtain the bond
holding of a worker (recall that the stock of patents held by workers is constant over
time).
bt (a) = m0 (a)π

, a < a∗ .
r

When the initial stock of patents held by the workers is zero, their bond holdings
are zero. When this stock is positive, workers’ income grows slower than g, so workers
lend in order to consume more than their labor income in the future.

Alternative decentralization

Consider the following alternative decentralization of the equilibrium. Competitive
R&D firms choose the fraction !(a) of workers with ability a in order to invent new
33

goods and sell the resulting patents. The problem for these firms is:
Z 1
Wt (a)!(a)da,
max ṁt V −
a

subject to:
ṁt =

Z

δnt a!(a)da.

a

The first-order condition for this problem is:
δnt aV = Wt (a).
Since all workers can earn wt in the labor market, the only workers who seek employment as entrepreneurs are those with a ≥ a∗ , where a∗ is given by:
Wt (a∗ ) = wt ,
which we can rewrite as:
δnt a∗ V = wt .
Since V = π/r, this equation is equivalent to equation (26).

Transitional dynamics
Homogeneous-ability model

We first show that the homogenous-ability model has no transitional dynamics.
π = α(1 − α)(2−α)/α η −(1−α)/α L(1 − τ ).
Equations (2) and (4) imply that the equilibrium wage rate is given by:

Equation (36) implies that wt /nt is constant. This property, together with equation
(38), implies that the value of the firm, Vt is also constant. Given that V̇t = 0, equation
(39) implies:
Vt =

rt

(40)

Replacing π t and rt in equation (40) for Vt ,
Vt =

α(1 − α)(2−α)/α η −(1−α)/α Lt (1 − τ )
.
σδ(H − Lt ) + ρ

Rearranging,
α(1 − α)(2−α)/α η −(1−α)/α Lt (1 − τ ) = V [σδ(H − Lt ) + ρ] .
Di§erentiating with respect to time, using the fact that V̇t = 0, we have
α(1 − α)(2−α)/α η −(1−α)/α L̇t (1 − τ ) = −L̇t V σδ.
This equation implies that L̇t = 0, so Lt is constant. This property implies that
π t is constant (equation (35)). Equation (40) implies that rt is constant. In sum, the
model has no transition dynamics.

Heterogenous-ability model

The free entry condition in the heterogenous-ability model is:
nδa∗t Vt = wt .
Since wt /nt is constant we have:

Conjecture that ȧ∗ = 0, so a∗t = a∗ . The free entry condition is:

We can now proceed as in the homogenous agent model and show that the real interest
rate and the growth rate are constant and that all equations are satisfied, so that a
constant value of a∗t is indeed a solution.
