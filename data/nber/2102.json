The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is yes. Both models, however, explain the month to month variability as resulting in a critical way from unobservable shocks to money demand and purchasing power parity. It would therefore be of interest in future work to model one or both of these shocks as explicit functions of economic variables.\n\n",
