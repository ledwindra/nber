    "abstract": "\n\nThis article examines the risks faced by China's real estate sector within its distinct hybrid economy, which combines market mechanisms with comprehensive state planning and government intervention. The real estate sector holds particular importance as land sale revenues are a crucial source of funding for local governments, enabling them to finance infrastructure projects and stimulate economic growth. Banks are highly exposed to debt secured by real estate properties, not only involving real estate firms and households but also extending to local governments and affiliated companies. The hybrid structure gives the government a strong commitment and the ability to delay a real estate crisis. However, China\u2019s real estate risk is ultimately tied to the country\u2019s overall economic growth and remains susceptible to policy-related risks.\n\n",
