Changes in Family Structure and Welfare Participation Since the 1960s: The Role of Legal
Services
Andrew Goodman-Bacon and Jamein P. Cunningham
NBER Working Paper No. 26238
September 2019
JEL No. H0,I38,N32
ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates the effects of the War on Poverty’s Legal Services Program (LSP) on family
structure and welfare participation. LSPs provided subsidized legal assistance to poor
communities, focusing on divorce and welfare access. We use a difference-in-differences
research design based on the rollout of the program to 251 counties from 1965 to 1975. We find
temporary increases in divorce and persistent increases in welfare participation and nonmarital
birth rates. Nonmarital births rose because marriage rates fell, not because birth rates rose.
Expanded access to legal institutions thus contributed, directly and indirectly, to changes in
family structure in the 1960s.

American families changed suddenly and dramatically in the 1960s. Marriage rates fell while
divorces and nonmarital births increased (Lundberg and Pollak 2007). The share of mothers who
were not married quadrupled between 1960 and 2010 (Figure 1). At the same time, married
women’s employment and unmarried women’s welfare participation skyrocketed (Moffitt 1987,
Goldin 2006). By 1980, mothers brought in one-third of family income, double their share in 1960.
In 1991, Gary Becker reflected that “the family in the Western world has been radically altered—
some claim almost destroyed—by the events of the last three decades” (Becker 1991, p. 1).
Understanding what caused these changes, however, has proven difficult. 1 The range of
explanations include a lack of marriageable men (Wilson 1987), intergenerational effects of a
“matriarchal” family structure (Moynihan 1965), contraceptive technology (Akerlof, Yellen, and
Katz 1996), second-wave feminism (Chafetz 1995), and the growth of welfare programs (Murray
1984). Evidence on broad trends in family structure tends to be correlational, while causal evidence
focuses on small interventions (e.g. Hannan, Tuma, and Groeneveld 1977) or local changes (e.g.
Black, McKinnish, and Sanders 2003) that cannot explain family change on such a large scale.
This paper quantifies the role of an overlooked catalyst of shifts in family structure: an
expansion in poor communities’ access to the legal system brought about by the Neighborhood
Legal Services Program (LSP). This understudied piece of the War on Poverty began in 1965 and
tripled the availability of free civil legal consultation in poor areas (Brownell 1971, Subcommittee
on Employment Manpower and Poverty 1970). LSPs handled individual disputes on issues like
divorce, housing, debt collection, welfare, and employment; engaged in community outreach on

1
Ellwood and Jencks (2004, p. 1) argue that “is only a slight exaggeration to say that quantitative social scientists’
main contribution to our understanding of this change has been to show that nothing caused single-parent families to
become more common.”

policing issues and economic empowerment; and sued local bureaucracies perceived as treating
the poor unfairly (Johnson 1977). Its originators believed that by translating poor people’s
demands into effective legal action, the LSP “would possibly be the single most important
thing…in the poverty program” (OEO Assistant General Counsel Stephen Pollak quoting Sargent
Shriver in Gillette 1996).
Embodying the rights-based legal movement of the 1960s, LSPs worked to improve poor
people’s access to government services, protections, and institutions, many of which matter for
decisions about family structure. LSPs directly served thousands of families in divorce cases and
in disputes with local welfare departments. One-fifth of the 282,000 cases handled by LSP
attorneys in 1968 were for divorce (Levitan 1969). LSP lawyers routinely consulted with families
about welfare rules and represented them in administrative appeals over benefit reductions or
terminations. 2 They also indirectly expanded welfare access by working with welfare advocacy
groups, writing plain language “welfare manuals” urging poor families to apply for benefits (Davis
1993), and suing local welfare departments over eligibility restrictions. LSP advocacy and
litigation created a plausibly permanent shift in expected public benefits even for those not directly
served by LSPs, changing the financial incentive to form single-parent families. In short, by
making poor people’s theoretical legal access a practical reality, LSPs had the potential to move
communities to a new equilibrium in terms of welfare take-up and family formation.

2

Sar Levitan (1969, p. 187) argued that “the indirect impact of the Legal Services Program should not be
minimized…Administrative agencies, too, may treat their clients in less arbitrary fashion and not view welfare
recipients as passive wards of the state.” Gilbert Steiner, then director of Governmental Studies at the Brookings
Institution, noted that without the LSP “there would have been no expansion of public assistance in the 1960s, just as
there had been none in the 1940s and 1950s” (Ginzberg and Solow 1974, p. 65).

2

To identify LSPs’ community-level effects, we use a difference-in-differences (DD)
research design and a semiparametric event-study specification (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan
1993) based on the program’s rollout to 251 counties between 1965 and 1975 (Cunningham 2016).
We digitized outcome data on divorces, marriages, nonmarital births, and welfare participation by
county from 1960 to 1988. Because the LSP rollout was concentrated within 5 years, we use two
complementary methods to find valid control counties. One specification includes state-by-year
and urban-group-by-year fixed effects to create a control group of similarly urbanized counties
without LSPs (“untreated counties”) in the same state (Bailey and Goodman-Bacon 2015,
Cunningham 2016). The second specification weights untreated counties by inverse propensity
scores to create a control group with similar pretreatment characteristics (Abadie 2005). The
results from both approaches are quite close, which supports the validity rollout design. 3
Our estimates suggest that the LSP played a central role in the rapidly changing family
structure and welfare participation of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s (see Figure 1 and Table 1). We
find that LSP establishment is associated with short-run increases in divorce rates. These effects
are consistent with 17,000 to 23,000 additional divorces per year at most, or just under half of the
56,000 divorce cases that LSPs handled in 1968. We also find persistent increases in participation
in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the cash welfare program for single parents,
which matches historical accounts of LSPs’ contribution to skyrocketing applications and appeals.
By 1984, AFDC participation rates in treated counties were 14 to 26 percent higher than our
estimated counterfactual (representing 249,000 to 424,000 additional cases). Lastly, we find that
LSPs affected family structure. By 1984, nonmarital birth rates rose by 16 percent relative to their

Fixed effects estimates are generally smaller than reweighted estimates, consistent with factors like state-level
policies or court decisions that make nearby counties more comparable than observationally similar but far away ones.

counterfactual level and between 1960 and 1970 the probability that mothers lived with the father
of their children fell by 2 percentage points (3 percentage points for mothers without a high school
degree). This comes not from an increase in births, but from a decline in marriage. We view
increased access to welfare programs restricted to single parents as the most likely mechanism. 4
These results provide a new window onto old questions about families and the safety net.
We provide some of the first plausibly causal evidence on the massive changes in family structure
that occurred in the 1960s. Our results show that policy mattered in the 1960s: the War on Poverty
contributed to increases in welfare use and nonmarital births. But these changes came from
expanded legal access, not statutory changes in “generosity.” The LSP facilitated access to a
package of benefits that had long been available in theory but in practice was restricted to the
“deserving poor” (Katz 1986). As the program’s architects envisioned, LSPs broke down financial
and institutional barriers to the legal system and safety net. What policymakers might not have
foreseen is that this large shift in access would alter family structure as well.
I.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM

American legal aid societies traditionally provided limited services on noncontroversial areas that
would not alienate their philanthropic base. 5 By the 1960s, new advocates sought to expand legal
services in both size and scope. In a 1964 Yale Law Review article, Jean and Edgar Cahn, attorneys

4

We also take steps to rule out several alternative explanations. Neither male/female sex ratios, economic conditions,
nor other local War on Poverty initiatives changed coincidentally with LSP introduction. We find similar effects when
we restrict comparisons to counties treated at different times or to counties that received a broader measure of War on
Poverty funding. Our effects are similar in counties that did and did not experience riots (Cunningham and Gillezeau
2018b)—a noted catalyst for urban decay and white flight (Collins and Margo 2007, 2004). We also estimate null
placebo effects for Community Health Centers, a program that likely shares confounding unobservables with LSPs.
5
American legal aid societies date to the settlement house movement. Energized by Great Britain’s federally funded
legal aid society, American legal aid grew in the 1950s. There were about 49 legal aid societies in 1949, and 236 by
1961 (Brownell 1971). These organizations provided limited services because they could not afford lengthy appeals
and turned away controversial cases (bankruptcy, divorce, or challenges to corporations or government agencies).

with the Ford Foundation’s Gray Areas program, proposed that university-affiliated neighborhood
law firms should provide free civil legal representation and advice in poor communities and
incorporate the “civilian perspective” into policy by supplying these communities with “the means
with which to represent the felt needs of its members” (Cahn and Cahn 1964, p. 1334). In contrast,
Ed Sparer, head of the legal unit for the influential juvenile delinquency program Mobilization for
Youth, argued for a test-case approach based on “legal action that would create new legal rights
for the poor” (quoted in Davis 1993, p. 33). Almost immediately after passage of the 1964
Economic Opportunity Act, Sargent Shriver, head of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO),
made legal services a National Emphasis Program that would do both. 6
LSPs sharply expanded the quantity of legal services available to the poor. The OEO
prioritized the program’s funding early in the War on Poverty, issuing more than 20 million
(nominal) dollars in grants in 1965. By 1968 LSP spending had doubled, and Figure 2 shows that
by 1975 LSPs had been rolled out to 273 counties in 48 states. Figure 3 plots the number of cases
handled by traditional legal aid societies from 1905 to 1965, and by LSPs from 1967 to 1971. After
60 years in existence, aid societies handled about 300,000 cases a year. In contrast, the LSP
handled 282,000 cases in 1968 and over a million by 1971. The average LSP center had five
lawyers, each working hundreds of cases per year (Cunningham 2016).
Rather than simply crowding out existing legal aid, LSPs provided new services. 7 The
OEO-funded facilities served populations and handled cases such as divorce and bankruptcy that

6

Sparer set up the Center for Social Welfare Policy and Law at Columbia University’s School of Social Work in 1965
to provide backup support for test cases brought by LSP attorneys.
7
Thanks to early endorsements from the American Bar Association and the American Trial Lawyers’ Association,
legal aid societies received about 40 percent of the initial grants in order to expand services or open new facilities.
Law schools facilitated the rollout by providing cheap labor in the form of newly trained lawyers, designing new
curricula in poverty law, and sometimes operating LSP offices directly (Johnson 2014, Cunningham 2016).

5

existing legal aid societies had been reluctant to take on (Cantrell 2003). Grantees opened new law
offices in poor neighborhoods with expanded hours of operation to increase accessibility. 8 LSPs
served poorer clients and a higher share of black women than traditional legal aid societies did,
and challenged public officials more (Fisher and Ivie 1971). Silverstein (1967) concludes that
LSPs “unquestionably had a liberalizing effect on both financial and subject-matter rules of
eligibility.”
Nearly 40 percent of LSP cases involved family problems like divorce, nonsupport, or
paternity, where free legal assistance and court fee waivers represented meaningful savings to
those served (Stumpf 1975). The median divorce in 1968 cost between $200 and $299 (University
of Michigan Survey Research Center 1984). For comparison, the poverty line for a family of four
in the early 1960s was about $3,000. Critics quickly accused the LSP of dissolving families. One
judge called them “divorce mills” (Stumpf and Janowitz 1969) and coverage in the New York
Times carried the subtitle “How to Get a Free Divorce” (Graham 1966). Supporters countered that
the poor had the same right to obtain a divorce as the rich and that these efforts protected poor
women’s economic interests (Foster and Freed 1967).
In addition to family law cases, about 7 percent of LSP cases challenged welfare
bureaucracies. Their primary target was Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the
means-tested cash welfare program for single-parent families. State and federal governments
financed AFDC but localities controlled almost all aspects of it. From its inception in 1935, local
caseworkers exercised wide and often arbitrary discretion over case acceptances, benefit amounts,

8

The OEO argued that “accessibility has long been recognized to be a prerequisite of effective legal assistance. The
impoverished are the least capable of traveling long distances to reach a lawyer. Even carfare may be beyond the
means of a slumdweller in legal trouble. Equally important, studies have demonstrated that a psychological barrier
exists between the inhabitants of a ghetto and the alien world of a bustling downtown area” (OEO 1966).

and case terminations (Bell 1965). This behavior stemmed from traditional notions of
deservingness (Skocpol 1992), local labor demand conditions (Alston and Ferrie 1985), and racial
discrimination (Quadagno 1994). LSP lawyers brought dozens of Supreme Court cases, including
notable victories that struck down residency requirements (Shapiro v. Thompson 1969) and
restrictions on cohabitation (King v. Smith 1968), and guaranteed a right to administrative appeals
(Goldberg v. Kelly 1970 and Wheeler v. Montgomery 1970).
Importantly, poverty lawyers also changed local public officials’ actions toward the poor.
They helped individual clients to fill out applications and frequently represented them in appeals
(“fair hearings”; Hollingsworth 1977). 9 One welfare official testified in the Senate Appropriations
committee in 1968 that “the OEO neighborhood legal attorneys are requesting more fair
hearings…[and] if we rule in their favor they immediately want to go back and review every
similar case” (quoted in Piven and Cloward 1971). LSPs also provided crucial expertise for the
growing welfare rights movement, which had “no access to lawyers, at least until federal legal
services grants were made available in 1966” (Davis 1993 p. 41). Welfare rights groups organized
recipients to protest administrative decisions, petitioned for additional benefits, and disseminated
“welfare manuals” that described regulations in simple language (see Online Appendix A).
A. Expected Effects of LSPs
This history suggests that establishment of a neighborhood LSP should increase divorce rates, but
only temporarily. For one, LSPs would initially meet “pent-up demand.” Handler, Hollingsworth,
and Erlanger (1978) document a fall in the share of time devoted to family law between 1967 and

Fair hearings are formal challenges to administrative decisions about eligibility and benefits. LSP lawyers
represented recipients at these hearings and encouraged them to file the appeals.

1972 and credit the “backlog of families with marital problems waiting for legal services.” 10
Second, the initial burst of divorces should occur among those marriages most likely to break up.
Therefore, the at-risk population shrinks and includes a higher share of marriages unlikely to
dissolve, both of which should reduce observed divorce rates.
We also expect LSPs to increase AFDC participation (a stock) substantially. By the early
1960s, local restrictions on eligibility and arbitrary caseworker decisions had become the norm in
AFDC. Families likely did not respond to statutory changes in benefits because the probability that
they could get and keep those benefits appeared low (Hoynes 1997, Moffitt 1994). The simplest
connection between LSPs and AFDC is that they boosted acceptances and reduced terminations
for individuals they represented. LSP advocacy and legal action against welfare offices, however,
had the same effect for a much larger class of people. LSPs simultaneously increased the
probability of receiving welfare conditional on applying (higher expected benefit) and reduced the
costs of applying or appealing decisions (lower expected costs). Both should increase take-up
among potentially eligible families, even those not served by LSPs (Ashenfelter 1983, Moffitt
1983). 11
Finally, many theoretical models predict that by making public assistance a reliable and
available source of income, LSPs should have changed people’s decisions about whether to form

10

Coverage of one LSP in rural Wisconsin in its sixth week described this phenomenon: “Statistics released by the
Judicare office here revealed that 84 percent of its cases so far have involved divorces…Judicare officials predict that
its high ratio of divorce cases will go down as soon as the first rush for long-delayed divorces is over” (Graham 1966).
Graham also cites a similar experience soon after legal services began in the UK: “When England started its program
in 1950, 80 percent of the clients wanted divorces. Since then the rate of matrimonial disputes among English legal
aid cases has declined to about 40 percent” See also the discussion in Wolfers (2006) in the context of unilateral
divorce.
11
Divorces also raise AFDC eligibility, and AFDC applications raise divorces because many states required women
to file for a divorce in order to receive welfare benefits after being deserted by their husband (Finman 1971).

or dissolve marriages (Rosenzweig 1999, Willis 1999, Neal 2004). The key reason is that AFDC
was almost exclusively available to single-parent families, and public benefits for non-disabled
two-parent families were rare. 12 By expanding access to welfare benefits, LSPs increased expected
public assistance income for poor women only if they raised children on their own. Unitary models
imply an increase in single motherhood stemming from women’s choices (Rosenzweig 1999, Neal
2004, Lundberg and Plotnick 1990), and bargaining models show how men can use the availability
of welfare as a pretext for desertion (Willis 1999, Lundberg and Pollak 1996). 13 Growing
prevalence of welfare participation, divorce, and single motherhood can also have feedback effects
by changing their social costs (Solon et al. 1988, Bertrand, Luttmer, and Mullainathan 2000). In
fact, Americans became much more accepting of these choices in the 1960s (Thornton 1989).
II.

DATA ON THE LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM, FAMILY STRUCTURE, AND WELFARE

Existing datasets like the Census (only decadal data) or Panel Study of Income Dynamics (which
began in 1968) have serious limitations for studying LSPs. To address this, we digitized new
county-by-year data on family structure outcomes and welfare participation using a number of
sources (see Online Appendix B for further details).
A. Treatment Variable: Legal Service Grants
Data on federal legal service grants funded by the OEO come from the National Archives
Community Action Program files originally compiled in Cunningham (2016). We created an LSP
treatment indicator equal to one starting in the year that counties received their first grant for “legal

12

The two programs that two-parent families with no disabilities could have received, General Assistance and AFDC
for Unemployed Parents (AFDC-UP), each had between 50,000 and 60,000 cases through most of the 1960s. AFDC
for single-parent families by contrast had 1 million cases in 1965 and 3 million by 1973. See section IV.E.
13
Ethnographic studies support this. Stack (1974, p. 113) concludes that “couples rarely chance marriage unless a man
has a job…women come to realize that welfare benefits and ties within kin networks provide greater security for them
and their children.”

9

services.” We only consider new LSPs established through 1975, when the program was
reorganized under the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). We chose not to use a continuous
measure of LSP funding to avoid bias from subsequent grant decisions that either supported
successful centers or compensated for failing ones. Table 2 shows the starting year for the 251
sample counties that received LSP grants from 1965 to 1975.
B. Family Structure Flows: Divorce, Marriage, and Nonmarital Births
Data on the number of divorces and marriages that occurred in each county come from the 1959–
1988 volumes of the Vital Statistics of the United States (DHEW various years). Our marriage and
divorce outcomes are rates per 1,000 women ages 10–49 (flows). 14 Population denominators come
from the 1960 Census (Haines and ICPSR 2010) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER 2013) annual data, which begin in 1968 (interpolated between 1960 and 1968). We
also digitized information on the number of births to unmarried residents of a subset of large
counties (1960 population over 50,000, or 1970 population over 100,000). Our nonmarital birth
outcomes are age-adjusted (using the national female distribution in 1960) nonmarital births per
1,000 women ages 10–49. 15

14
We use population counts down to age 10 because nonmarital births are recorded for women “under 15.” We use
this as the denominator for all outcomes to facilitate comparisons across results.
15
Debates over family structure frequently focus on race. For example, Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s 1965 report, “The
Negro Family: A Case for National Action,” both implicated racism in the prevalence of single-parent black families
and argued, controversially (Rainwater and Yancey 1967), that it represented a “tangle of pathology” (Moynihan
1965). While black mothers were more likely than white mothers to be unmarried (28.9 percent versus 7.7 percent in
1960), they were also significantly poorer even conditional on marital status. The proportional growth in unmarried
motherhood between 1960 and 1980, however, was actually larger for white women (97 percent) than black women
(75 percent). Race-specific explanations for changing family structure in the 1960s are necessarily incomplete.
Furthermore, we cannot measure county-level outcomes by race. Therefore, an analysis of LSPs’ effect on racespecific family structure is beyond the scope of this paper.

10

C. Welfare Stocks: AFDC Cases
County-level data on caseloads and spending on AFDC come from federal reports published in
1960, 1964, 1966, and annually from 1968 to 1988. Reports after 1980 only include counties in
Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs). Our welfare outcome is AFDC cases per 1,000
women ages 10–49. Our divorce, marriage, nonmarital birth, and AFDC data are all new and the
only source of local-level, high-frequency information on these outcomes during this time period.
D. 1960 and 1970 Census Data
We also use a sample of 623,175 mothers living in 81 counties identified in the 1960 and 1970
Census to calculate probabilities that mothers are unmarried heads of household; live with the
father of their children; or are poor. 16 We collapse these outcomes to county-year averages and
then take the 1960–1970 difference so that all Census-based models have 81 observations.
E. Estimation Samples
Because of differences in reporting across data sources, we use five estimation samples. From all
US counties, we first exclude Alaska, Hawaii, and Nevada (where a disproportionate number of
non-resident marriages and divorces occur). For Sample 1, our main sample, we then drop counties
that failed to report marriages and divorces in every year from 1959 to 1988 (345 counties) or
AFDC cases in every year available in federal reports from 1960 to 1980 (10 counties). This yields
a balanced panel of marriage and divorce from 1960 to 1988 and AFDC in every available year
from 1960 to 1980, comprising 2,683 counties that contain 94 percent of women in the US. Sample
2 includes the 603 SMSA counties with AFDC rates through 1988 (71 percent of US women),

16
We also construct dummy variables that describe the cumulative distribution of unearned income, earned income,
and income from other family members. Each dummy equals one for mothers who report income (by source) greater
than or equal to 𝑥𝑥. We estimate effects on a series of dummies that move 𝑥𝑥 from $0 to $100,000 in $2,000 increments
(“distribution regression” Chernozhukov, Fernández-Val, and Melly 2013). We describe this method further below.

11

allowing us to observe counties up to 13 years after LSP establishment. Sample 3 includes the 112
counties with nonmarital births recorded in every year from 1959 to 1979 (23 percent of US
women). Sample 4 includes the 60 counties that record nonmarital births from 1959 to 1988 (20
percent of US women). Lastly, Sample 5 includes the 81 Census counties (36 percent of women).
III. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY: DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES AND THE ROLLOUT OF THE
LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM
We use a two-way fixed effects event-study specification to trace out changes in outcomes in each
year around LSP establishment:
𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 + 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝜷𝜷′ 𝑿𝑿𝒄𝒄𝒄𝒄 + � 𝜋𝜋𝑗𝑗 1{𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐∗ = 𝑗𝑗} + � 𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗 1{𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐∗ = 𝑗𝑗} + 𝜈𝜈𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 .
𝑗𝑗∈𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

𝑗𝑗∈𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

(1)

𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 and 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 are county and year fixed effects, and the 1{𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐∗ = 𝑗𝑗} are event-study dummies that

equal one if an observation is exactly 𝑗𝑗 years from county 𝑐𝑐’s LSP treatment date, and zero

otherwise. 17 The first sum includes pre-LSP event-years so that the 𝜋𝜋𝑗𝑗 coefficients capture
pretreatment trends in outcome 𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 . The second sum includes post-LSP event-years. Because we

observe data at the county level, the 𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗 coefficients are intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates.

Identification comes from comparing LSP to non-LSP counties and comparing counties

that received LSPs in different years. Table 2, however, reveals little variation in the timing of LSP
treatment: 205 counties are treated in 1966 or 1967 and over 98 percent of the identifying variation
comes from LSP/non-LSP comparisons (see theorem 1 in Goodman-Bacon 2018a). Therefore, our
identifying assumption is essentially that there are common trends in untreated potential outcomes

We omit the event-study dummy for the year before LSP treatment (𝑗𝑗 = −1) and include but do not report on
dummies for unbalanced event-times.

between treated and untreated counties (rather than common trends between counties that received
LSP funding in different years). 18
The history of the War on Poverty, especially the initial stages during which most LSPs
received grants, supports this assumption. The early OEO was a “wild sort of operation” that
fielded proposals from “various and sundry groups” (Davis 1993, Johnson 1974, Gillette 1996).
According to Earl Johnson, Jr., the director of the LSP from 1966 to 1968, “we were committed to

“neither

considerations…[but] quite simply, on the desire to give out as much money as quickly as
possible” (Goodman and Walker 1975, p. 7).
Still, funds went mainly to cities because of the OEO’s focus on urban poverty (Bailey and
Duquette 2014) and LSPs’ need to hire trained lawyers . Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 show strong
pretreatment imbalance between LSP and non-LSP counties. Large cities dominate the treatment
group, which has 9 percent of counties but over half of the 1960 population. Non-LSP counties are
less urban, poorer; have lower levels of education and divorce, but higher AFDC and marriage
rates.
In response to this imbalance we take two complementary approaches to creating a valid
control group. First, we estimate models that form the implicit control group using state-by-year
fixed effects, which restrict comparisons to counties in the same state, and separate year fixed

18
As discussed in Goodman-Bacon (2018a), the identifying assumption aggregates pairwise common trends by the
variance of a treatment dummy across treatment-timing groups (i.e., rows of Table 1). In practice, the variance weights
on each treatment-timing group are almost identical to sample shares.

13

effects interacted with dummies for seven bins of the 1960 urban share, which restricts
comparisons to similarly urban counties. This controls for the common effects of state-level policy
changes (in, e.g., Medicaid, birth control access, or divorce reform) and changes that affect urban
areas (e.g., white flight or the 1973 recession). Column 4 shows that fixed effects achieve balance
in many characteristics (see p-values in column 5), while the detectable differences tend to be
much smaller than in the unadjusted comparison. Taken together, observable characteristics do
predict LSP treatment status, but the F-statistic is half its size in the unadjusted comparison (and
falls by half if we omit the urban share). 19
The second model creates a control group that is balanced on pretreatment characteristics.
We estimate propensity scores, 𝑝𝑝̂ (𝑥𝑥𝑐𝑐 ), from a probit model for the probability that counties receive
an LSP grant as a function of all the covariates listed in Table 3, and we weight untreated counties
𝑝𝑝�(𝑥𝑥 )

in our regressions by 1−𝑝𝑝�(𝑥𝑥𝑐𝑐 (Abadie 2005, DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux 1996). 20 This creates a
)
𝑐𝑐

control group that is balanced on pretreatment characteristics but may compare areas from very

different parts of the country (possibly with different locally enacted policies). Column 6 of Table
3 verifies that reweighting achieves balance jointly and for each covariate individually, except in
the urban share, which differs by only 3.6 percentage points.

19

Section V also reports results from specifications that rely only on the timing of LSP establishment, drop the 1966
and 1967 counties, trim to ensure propensity score overlap, compare only to contiguous counties, drop counties that
ever experienced a riot (or the largest increase in black population shares), control for other War on Poverty policies,
and control for local welfare activism. We also show null placebo effects for Community Health Center establishment,
a policy that we do not expect to affect family structure but which was funded by the same process as that of LSPs.
20
We recalculate propensity scores and weights for each estimation sample. Online Appendix Figure C5 shows the
propensity score distributions, and Online Appendix Figure C6 scatters the propensity scores from different samples
against each other. The inclusion of pretreatment levels and trends in outcomes is similar to the synthetic control
estimator of Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010). Goodman-Bacon (2018b) points out that this strategy only
affects comparisons between treated and untreated counties (and not between counties treated at different times), and
also does not impose balance between untreated counties and each timing group. Most counties receive LSPs in 1966
or 1967, however, so this is not a major limitation.

14

IV. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ESTIMATES
Figures 4 through 8 plot pretreatment coefficients, 𝜋𝜋𝑗𝑗 , and post-treatment coefficients, 𝜙𝜙𝑗𝑗 , from

(1) using both reweighted and fixed effects estimators. Dashed lines are 95-percent pointwise
confidence intervals from standard errors clustered by county. Table 4 presents grouped estimates
for years 0–5 and 6–13, and p-values from 500 random permutations of the LSP treatment that
hold the distribution of treatment dates constant.
A. Divorces
Figure 4 shows that divorce rates have a hump-shaped response to LSP establishment, rising for
about four years then falling and returning to zero after about eight years. Consistent with our
identifying assumption, neither specification provides any evidence of differential pre-LSP trends.
Divorce rates in treated counties only change after LSP begins. 21 Five years after LSP
establishment, divorce rates in treated counties rose by between 0.5 and 0.7 per 1,000 women
relative to untreated counties, or about 5.5 to 7.7 percent over the baseline mean of 9 divorces per
1,000 women. Table 4 reports average short-run increases in years 0–5 of 0.46 (se = 0.16,
permutation p = .11) in the reweighted specification and 0.34 (se = 0.16, permutation p = .142) in
the fixed effects specification. The estimates for years 6–13 are negative but not statistically
significant, consistent with both an increase in the divorce hazard shrinking the pool of at-risk
marriages, and dynamic selection as remaining marriages are those least likely to divorce.

21

The LSP effects do not appear in the first year (event year 0), partly because we do not distinguish when in a year
LSP grants were made and also because LSP grantees had to hire staff, find volunteers, and build community support
in order to be able to begin providing services. Finally, a few LSPs restricted the number of divorce cases handled or
only took clients for divorce on certain days of the week, partly due to their perception of the social ills associated
with female-headed households (Silver 1969, Pious 1971, Katz 1978, Hannon 1969).

15

Relative to poor women’s divorce rates, these magnitudes are large but plausible. If all
divorces came from the 15 percent of urban women who were poor in the 1960s, our largest eventstudy estimates suggest increases of at most 3.3 to 4.6 divorces per 1,000 poor women per year.
Rescaling the event-study coefficients this way and summing them implies that in their first seven
years of operation, LSPs could have led to an increase of between 1.7 and 2.5 percent in the number
of poor women getting divorced. Between 1960 and 1970, the share of poor women who were
currently divorced rose from 5.1 to 8.5 percent (and this understates the probability of ever
divorcing, because some women remarry). These upper-bound calculations suggest an important
role for LSPs in the short-run surge in divorces.
LSPs could have easily handled this number of divorces. The average treated county in our
sample had 122,000 women aged 10 to 49 when LSPs began operating, so the largest ITT estimates
come from just 63 to 86 additional divorces per year. For reference, the average LSP lawyer
handled 50 to 100 new cases each month. Summing this maximum number of additional divorces
across 273 treated counties implies that at its peak, LSP caused 17,000 to 23,000 divorces per year,
30 to 40 percent of the 56,000 divorces they handled in 1968 (one-fifth of 282,000 cases; Levitan
1969). The concordance of these divorce results with LSPs’ documented activities, LSP capacity,
and historical reports of pent-up demand provides “first-stage”-type evidence that our
identification strategy successfully picks up the effects of changing legal access brought on
suddenly by LSP establishment.

16

B. Welfare Participation
Figure 5 shows that AFDC participation increased sharply after LSP establishment. 22 Again,
neither specification nor different samples show evidence that these changes come from preexisting trends. After LSP establishment, AFDC cases rise steadily and stabilize after 9 years.
Table 4 reports longer-run effects (years 6–13) of 6.55 cases per 1,000 women (se = 1.53,
permutation p = .000) in the fixed effects specification and 10.25 cases (se = 1.90, permutation p
= .000) in the reweighted specification. 23
Table 5 puts these magnitudes in context by using the estimated effects to calculate
counterfactual outcomes in 1984. In 1984, 56 women per 1,000 in treated counties received AFDC
(column 1 row b), and the LSP treatment effects imply a counterfactual rate of between 44 and 49
women (column 1 rows d and e). This suggests that LSPs raised AFDC rates by between 7 and 12
women per 1,000, a 14 to 26 percent increase over the counterfactual (rows h and i). Scaling by
the actual change in AFDC rates in treated counties from 1964 to 1984 (37 women per 1,000)
suggests that LSPs explain 18 to 31 percent of the observed growth in treated counties (rows j and
k). We repeat these calculations in column 2 for all counties in Sample 2 and find that LSPs could
explain up to 15 percent of the growth in AFDC rates across the 603 SMSA counties.
As with the divorce results, rising AFDC rates track high-profile activities undertaken by
LSP attorneys. Table 6 is comparable to Table 5 but scaled to reflect case counts instead of rates.
It shows that LSPs generated from 249,000 to 424,000 additional AFDC cases by 1984; 900 to

Because the AFDC data are not available annually in the 1960s, we group event years into [– 6, – 3], [−2, −1], [0,1]
and individual event-years thereafter.
23
Note that these results only reflect LSPs local effects. Supreme Court victories striking down residency and
cohabitation restrictions and guaranteeing fair hearings affected welfare eligibility everywhere, but our design
necessarily differences out these effects. State-by-year fixed effects also capture LSP victories in state courts or
through threat effects on regulations. Some states immediately changed rules and regulations to avoid going to court
(Champagne 1974).
22

17

1,550 in the average treated county. These are plausible effects over 10 to 20 years. Fair hearings,
a common way that attorneys helped clients remain on aid, rose from about 29,300 in the last six
months of 1970 (the earliest data available) to more than 86,000 in the first six months of 1975
(National Center for Social Statistics 1976b). Applications grew from 230,000 in the first quarter
of 1965 (Bureau of Public Assistance 1948-1970) to 665,000 in the first quarter of 1975 (National
Center for Social Statistics 1976a). The AFDC estimates further supports the rollout design
because they correspond closely with historical reports of LSP efforts in this area.
C. Nonmarital Births
Figure 6 shows that LSP establishment is also associated with sharp increases in nonmarital births.
We find no evidence of differential trends in the 6 years before LSP establishment in either
specification or sample. The pattern of ITT estimates is almost identical to the AFDC results in
Figure 5: after LSP establishment, nonmarital births grow at first but stabilize after 8 or 9 years.
Columns 5 and 6 of Table 4 show short-run increases of 0.34 nonmarital births per 1,000 women
per year (se = 0.15, permutation p = .018) in the fixed effects specification and 0.62 nonmarital
births (se = 0.14, permutation p = .004) in the reweighted model; 6.5 and 12 percent, respectively,
over the baseline mean of 5.2. 24
Table 5 shows that these changes explain 36 to 41 percent of the growth in non-marital
birth rates in the 50 treated counties observed through 1988, and 30 to 34 percent of the change in
all 60 counties in the long sample. About 20 percent of all US births in 1965 were to residents of
these counties. Therefore, our effects apply to a large population, but still a relatively small fraction

24

Online Appendix Figure D4 shows that almost all of the overall increase comes from younger women most likely
to conceive children before ever marrying. For both teens and women in their 20s, nonmarital births rise by about 3
per 1,000 women 8 years after LSP establishment. To a lesser extent we find increasing nonmarital births among
women ages 30–39, whose marital status may also have been affected by subsidized divorce.

18

of the country. If we observed all counties we would (mechanically) conclude that LSPs account
for a much smaller share of the nationwide changes in nonmarital births.
Another way to gauge these magnitudes is to sum up the effects of LSPs on nonmarital
birth flows and compare them to the effect of LSPs on AFDC stocks. The fixed effects
specification shows an increase in nonmarital birth rates of 0.34 in years 0–5, which implies an
aggregate increase of 2.04 nonmarital births per 1,000 women (6*0.34). The AFDC effect in eventyear 5 is 5.7 cases per 1,000 women, implying that over this time frame new nonmarital births
could account for at most 36 percent of new AFDC cases (the share is 53 percent in the reweighted
specification). As we would expect given that LSPs both worked on behalf of current AFDC
recipients and boosted take-up, only part of the LSP-induced growth in welfare cases comes from
new nonmarital births.
D. Why did nonmarital births change?
For births to unmarried women to increase, either nonmarital fertility must rise or marriages must
fall (or both). Figure 8 shows that both marriage and fertility fell after LSP establishment,
suggesting that marriage behavior and not conceptions drives the increase in nonmarital births.
The reduction in marriages explains why we find increasing nonmarital births: after LSPs begin
operating, pregnant women forego marriage. This matches nationwide results showing flat
premarital conceptions for these cohorts but falling shotgun marriage rates (England, Wu, and
Shafer 2013). Lower marriage rates also help explain falling fertility rates overall. Since marital
fertility exceeds nonmarital fertility, fewer marriages mean fewer births. Consistent with this,
evidence from the Census sample (discussed below) in Online Appendix Figure E3 shows that
mothers without a high school degree are less likely to have more than one child.

19

E. Heterogeneity by State Divorce and Welfare Policy
If the short-run increase in divorces in Figure 4 was due to LSP attorneys, we would expect to find
larger effects in states with legal environments that made it easier for poor families to initiate
divorce proceedings and for LSPs to finish them. Table 7 reports results that split the sample into
states that implemented no-fault divorce after (Panel A) or before (Panel B) 1970. We find much
larger divorce effects in the early reform states. Consistent with welfare incentives (rather than
divorces per se) as the main mechanism for the AFDC and nonmarital birth effects, we find very
similar short-run changes in both outcomes in the earlier and later divorce reform states.
We also estimate separate results by whether or not states operated an AFDC-UP
(Unemployed Parent) program that allowed married women to get welfare. Here we expect larger
effects on AFDC in states with more expansive eligibility criteria because of the UP program, but
smaller nonmarital birth effects because women did not need to divorce or forego marriage
altogether to receive aid. This is exactly the pattern we find in panels C and D of Table 7: in states
with an UP program by 1975, post-LSP changes in AFDC are twice as big while changes in
nonmarital births are half as big as in non-UP states. While these differences are generally not
statistically distinguishable, the patterns of heterogeneity conform to expectations about how LSPs
interacted with different legal and policy environments.
F. Effects on Stock Measures of Family Structure and Household Income
Our county-by-year data allow inference about pre-trends and dynamic ITT effects, but not about
living arrangements or other sources of household income. This section addresses these limitations
using our Census sample.
Table 8 shows that the increase in nonmarital births does translate to changes in household
structure. We find significant increases of between 1.4 and 1.8 percentage points in the probability
20

that mothers were unmarried heads of household, and a nearly identical reduction in the probability
that they lived with the father of their children. Consistent with LSPs’ mission to serve poor
communities, columns 2–4 show the largest effects for mothers with less than a high school degree
(although they are present to some extent for all mothers in the reweighting model).
Figure 8 uses distribution regression to estimate post-LSP changes in the distribution of
mother’s income by source. While the 1960 Census does not record welfare income, we find clear
increases in low levels of unearned income. This likely represents welfare income, however,
because the pattern almost perfectly matches the annualized distribution of AFDC benefits from
1967 administrative data (see Online Appendix Figure E2). Earned income falls to some extent,
although these findings are quite imprecise. Notably, other family income, which primarily
consists of husband’s earnings, falls at the low end of the distribution. This follows from the
finding that fathers are less likely to be in the household.
The last row in each panel of Table 8 shows that the combination of falling income and
falling household size leaves poverty rates unchanged. Overall, the Census results suggest that
family structure did change in meaningful ways, but that poverty did not rise because reductions
in father’s income were matched by changes in household size and offset by welfare income.
V.

RULING OUT ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS

The evidence presented so far uses two distinct control groups and shows changes in outcomes
that only occur after LSP establishment. Given the profound social changes that occurred in the
1960s, however, a number of threats to a causal interpretation of our results therefore remain.
Figures 9, 10, and 11 plot estimates from a range of specifications that test alternative explanations
for changes in divorce rates, AFDC participation, and nonmarital birth rates, respectively. For
comparison, we reproduce the estimates from Table 4 in the first two rows of each figure.
21

A. Different Ways to Use LSP Timing
Since so many counties received LSP funding in 1966 or 1967, determinants of family structure
that changed sharply in these years, such as cultural shifts that affected cities, could bias our
estimates. Row 3 shows reweighted estimates that drop the 1966 and 1967 LSP counties and are
identified by the 68 counties that introduced the LSP in other years. Standard errors increase
substantially but the point estimates do not meaningfully change.
Both of our specifications would be biased if the OEO allocated LSP funding to places that
experienced the upheaval of the 1960s differently. Row 4 presents estimates from a “stacked DD”
strategy that matches counties treated in year 𝑡𝑡 ∗ with a control group of counties treated in 𝑡𝑡 ∗ + 4
or later, dropping years after the controls receive their LSP (Deshpande and Li 2017, Fadlon and

Nielsen 2015). 25 This yields short-run DD estimates for early LSP counties that only compare
treated counties to those treated at least 4 years later. Reassuringly, restricting comparisons to
counties chosen by the OEO does not change our short-run estimates. 26
B. Racial Uprisings
An obvious candidate explanation for our findings is that they stem from the shock and aftermath
of racial uprisings that led to widespread violence and property damage, spikes in deaths due to
law enforcement (Cunningham and Gillezeau 2018a), a permanent depression of property values
(Collins and Margo 2007), worse labor market conditions for black Americans (Collins and Margo

Our regression interacts county and year fixed effects with indicators for each “stack” defined by 𝑡𝑡 ∗ .
Online Appendix Table D1 shows that using a control group of “contiguous” untreated counties produces similar
results. We also compare non-treated contiguous counties to non-treated counties further away from treated counties
and find no statistical difference in family structure and AFDC take-up. This suggests limited spillovers. Online
Appendix Figures D5–D7 also show that trimming the sample to include only counties with estimated propensity
scores between 0.1 and 0.9 (as suggested by (Crump et al. 2009)) does not change the results.
25
26

22

2004), white flight, and a shrinking tax base (Boustan 2010). Row 5 re-estimates our models on a
sample of counties that never experienced a riot. We find the same pattern of results in these areas
as in the full sample. 27
C. Urban Decay and Marriage Markets
Figure 12 provides more evidence on the possibility of bias from changing marriage markets or
eroding economic conditions. Panel A uses local-level sex ratios calculated from the 1930–1990
Censuses (Haines and ICPSR 2010) as outcomes, and finds no change in sex ratios after the 1960s
either in the decadal point estimates or in linear trends fit to the pre- and post-1960 data points. At
least on the county level the supply of men to marriage markets cannot bias our results. 28 To test
for differential changes in “marriageability,” Panel B uses data on payroll per worker from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (available since 1962). We find no evidence that earnings diverged
after LSPs began. 29 Falling male earnings therefore cannot explain the changing family structure
and welfare participation we document.
D. Other War on Poverty Initiatives
The OEO set up many local programs besides the LSP. If LSP counties also systematically
received grants for other programs that encouraged welfare take-up, for example, we would
overstate the effect of LSP alone. Figure 13 uses data on annual grants for Community Action

27

Out of 112 counties in the short-run nonmarital birth sample, 76 experienced a riot, so we include time-to-first-riot
dummies in Figure 11 instead of dropping observations. Panel A of Online Appendix Table D2 shows that dropping
the counties in the highest quintile of growth in their black share, a consequence of riots, does not alter our estimates.
28
Online Appendix Figure C2 shows no relative changes in race-specific sex ratios either.
29
Online Appendix Figure C3 shows a gradual reduction in log employment that does not begin until six years after
LSP establishment. Appendix Figure C4 uses the Census sample to estimate reweighted distributional effects on men’s
earnings using the same method as in Figure 8. Neither all men ages 18–54 nor men without a high school diploma
show evidence of differential changes in the distribution of earnings between 1960 and 1970, further suggesting that
marriageability cannot explain our findings.

23

Programs (CAP), Head Start, Community Health Centers (CHC)s, and Family Planning clinics to
test how often these new social programs rolled out together. Similar to Bailey and GoodmanBacon (2015), we find little evidence of bundling. Compared to the (mechanically) large and
sustained increase in LSP grants, no other program increases very much.
The largest change is in CAP grants, which precede LSP funding by a few years. CAPs
had oversight over many experimental programs and development projects funded by the OEO,
but they also served a community organizing function that could conceivably influence public
assistance. Row 6 in Figures 9, 10, and 11 controls for time-to-first-CAP dummies and our main
estimates do not change. 30
E. The National Welfare Rights Organization
Our results may also confound the effect of LSPs with the independent effects of local chapters of
the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO; West 1981). As we discussed, LSPs often
served as the legal wing for welfare rights groups (Davis 1993) but the two did not always coincide.
We gathered information on the spread of WROs from membership reports and national
conference attendance sheets from the archives of NWRO founder George Wiley. Row 7 in
Figures 9, 10, and 11 shows that our results are robust to controlling for time-to-NWRO
dummies. 31 LSPs’ work with WROs is a likely mechanism, but the welfare activism occurring
more broadly cannot explain our results. 32

30

We also estimated models on a sample of counties that ever received a CAP. This limits the controls to counties
selected by the OEO for some bundle of programs. If our main estimates are biased by comparing counties that did or
did not apply/receive funds, this sample restriction should eliminate our effects. In fact they do not change.
31
Row 8 adds controls for riots, CAPs, and NWROs and again finds negligible changes in our main estimates.
32
These are not admissible controls if LSPs causally affect WRO establishment. If, on the other hand, WROs spring
up independently but LSPs make them more effective, these estimates net out the effect of a WRO alone. Online
Appendix A provides archival evidence on how LSPs and WROs worked together that is consistent with the second
explanation.

24

F. Placebo Treatment: Community Health Centers
Lastly, Row 9 uses a similar War on Poverty program, CHCs, as a placebo test. CHCs share
important characteristics and probably unobservables with LSPs. They received local funding from
the OEO in similar patterns over time and space. They required high-skilled labor (doctors instead
of lawyers) and hired young, idealistic professional school graduates. We have no reason to expect
that CHCs should affect family structure or welfare participation, however, as they focused almost
exclusively on providing health services. We take CHC treatment dates from Bailey and
Goodman-Bacon (2015), calculate propensity scores exactly as we do for our main results, and
estimate short- and long-run DD coefficients for this placebo program. We find no evidence of
changes in divorce, AFDC participation, or nonmarital birth rates after CHC establishment, even
though the program arose from a nearly identical process to that of LSPs.
VI. DISCUSSION: LSP EFFECTS IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT
The evidence presented above is consistent with a causal interpretation of the relationship between
LSP establishment and divorce, welfare participation, and nonmarital births. Event-study estimates
show no evidence of pre-trends and match LSPs’ reported activities both in sign and scale. Census
results show larger changes among lower-educated mothers, those most likely to use LSPs. War
on Poverty policies, welfare activism, urban riots, white flight, economic conditions, and sex ratios
fail to account for our results. Lastly, other programs allocated in the same way bear no relationship
to our main outcomes. We highlight three main implications of these findings for our historical
understanding of the 1960s, evidence on economic models of family formation, and current policy.
A. LSPs as a Cause of Family Change in the 1960s
Public discourse and policy have rightly focused on the unprecedented changes to American
families in the last 50 years. The controversial 1965 Moynihan report argued that a self25

perpetuating “tangle of pathology” was generating skyrocketing black single motherhood rates
(Moynihan 1965). Moynihan’s analysis came under immediate attack for its assumptions about
the causality between poverty and “family breakdown” and the fact that he ignored similar trends
in white single parenthood (Rainwater and Yancey 1967). Single motherhood returned to the
spotlight in the 1980s, its prevalence alternately ascribed to decades of safety net growth (Murray
1984) or the shrinking pool of “marriageable” (black) men (Wilson 1987). 33 Recent evidence
shows that in addition to their “marriageability,” men’s physical absence (through incarceration)
can partly explain changing family structure (Charles and Luoh 2010).
Our results support the general conclusion that policy mattered, and highlight the
previously overlooked LSP. Some of the LSPs’ effects lined up clearly with their goals. One LSP
lawyer observed that “if you can help a woman who was deserted ten years ago get a divorce now,
I think that is breaking the cycle of poverty” (Finman 1971). LSP lawyers challenged welfare
bureaucracies because they were especially unresponsive and arbitrary and as part of a judicial
strategy to secure a guaranteed income. Increasing divorce and AFDC rates were therefore
intended consequences of the LSP program. Importantly, these changes came from a policy of
expanding access to legal services, institutions, and benefits, not a policy of expanding the “total
welfare package,” as is commonly claimed (Murray 1993, p. S225).

33

Both explanations already had a long history. Skocpol (1992, p. 467) quotes a 1914 argument against providing
Mothers Pensions to groups other than widows from the Report of the New York State Commission on Relief for
Widowed Mothers: “To pension desertion or illegitimacy would, undoubtedly, have the effect of putting a premium
on these crimes against society.” Du Bois and Eaton (1899, p. 53) note in their study of Philadelphia that “the first
thing that strikes one is the unusual excess of females. This fact, which is true of all Negro urban populations, has not
often been noticed, and has not been given its true weight as a social phenomenon.” They credit sociologist Kelly
Miller of Howard University with the observation (a fact brought to our attention by Gerald Jaynes).

26

B. Welfare as a Mechanism
We do, however, view the incentives created by AFDC and unlocked by LSPs as a key explanation
for our finding that marriage rates fell and nonmarital birth rates rose after LSP establishment.
Theoretical predictions from unitary models (Becker 1991, Neal 2004) and bargaining models
(Willis 1999) as well as ethnographic research (Stack 1974) support the interpretation that a benefit
specifically for single parents should raise single parenthood. Moffitt (1992, p. 27) concludes that
“virtually any model of marital status and childbearing behavior will have these implications.”
Empirical research on welfare and family structure, however, is mixed. Panel approaches
find no effect of year-to-year changes in welfare generosity on family structure (Hoynes 1997,
Moffitt 1994), although there is some evidence that living arrangements respond (Ellwood and
Bane 1985). For non-benefit policies, Kearney (2004) finds no effect of family caps, Bitler et al.
(2004) find that welfare reform reduced divorce and marriage rates, and Schoeni and Blank (2000)
find that pre-welfare-reform waivers reduced female headship. Randomized evaluations of specific
program parameters both from the Negative Income Tax experiments and AFDC waivers in the
1990s provide mixed evidence on marital status and fertility among women already receiving
benefits (Grogger, Karoly, and Klerman 2002, Hannan, Tuma, and Groeneveld 1977).
Our results suggest that changes in the ease with which poor women could actually receive
welfare benefits can help explain this discrepancy. Local restrictions on eligibility and arbitrary
caseworker decisions had become the norm in AFDC by the 1960s. Families did not respond to
benefit changes because the probability that they could get and keep those benefits appeared low.
We document, both historically and empirically, that LSPs drastically changed this situation.34

34
Moffitt (1987) describes a “structural shift” in take-up in the 1960s, concluding that “(1) attitudes toward welfare
changed over the period and the stigma of welfare receipt fell; and (2) a series of court and legislative decisions that
liberalized eligibility during the period made participation easier.” The LSP is likely responsible to a degree for both.

They ensured that families entitled to benefits could get them, which exposed poor families to
welfare incentives in one sense for the first time. Moreover, these changes were plausibly
permanent. 35 Setting new precedents for the way welfare bureaucracies treated recipients,
improving information about rules, and encouraging applications and administrative challenges
are essentially irreversible. Economic models of cash programs and family structure therefore have
more empirical support than evidence from short-run changes in an uncertain benefit suggested.
It is important to note the potential interaction of LSPs’ effects on welfare with other
changes in marriage markets. Neal’s (2004) model of family structure emphasizes the interaction
between the quality of men and safety net policy. 36 Therefore, while we interpret our findings as
the causal effects of the LSP, they may not generalize to other contexts where background changes
in men’s circumstances are not the same. As we argued earlier, however, understanding family
structure trends in the 1960s specifically is important for researchers and policymakers.
C. What does an LSP effect mean for policy?
Policymakers have relied on different interpretations of family structure changes to propose
drastically different policies. In 1961, for example, President Kennedy expanded welfare to twoparent families because “too many fathers, unable to support their families, have resorted to real
or pretended desertion to qualify their children for help” (Kennedy 1977). In 1965, on the other
hand, Moynihan advocated a federal job guarantee and then a basic income in order to address
rising single motherhood (O'Connor 2001). Murray (1984, p. 227) proposed “scrapping the entire

35

Rosenzweig (1999) argues that family structure, a long-term decision, should not be strongly affected by short-run
changes in benefits, and McKinnish (2008) provides empirical support in the case of AFDC and fertility by comparing
short and long differences.
36
Cunningham (2016) shows that LSP establishment led to higher arrest rates by improving community/police
relations and increasing crime reporting. We find no evidence that these changes altered sex ratios or men’s earnings
differentially in LSP counties in the way that prison policy did in the 1980s.

28

federal welfare and income-support structure for working-aged persons.” Ultimately, 1996’s
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act did dramatically shrink cash
welfare for families. The legislation specifically sought to promote marriage, “reduce the incidence
of out-of-wedlock pregnancies,” and “encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent
families.” 37
Our findings support the claim that cash welfare restricted to single parents, when
recipients can access it, affects family structure. But our findings are not consistent with a story
where families changed because the safety net became more generous. The LSP brought the de
facto welfare system closer to the de jure welfare system. We do not know how family structure
would have responded to a less generous safety net without these arbitrary restrictions, or a more
generous safety net not limited to single parents. (In fact, a motivation for AFDC was to keep
children and mothers together.) Moreover, we do not find that these changes increased poverty.
Considering policy around legal services, it is hard to imagine policymakers “going the
other way.” In 1975, the Neighborhood Legal Services Program went through sweeping changes
with new oversight and restrictions from the newly created Legal Services Corporation (LSC). By
1980, tenant-landlord disputes dominated LSP caseloads and reform cases became essentially nonexistent. But it is even harder to imagine a plausible, legal, or ethical policy that reimposes
unconstitutional bureaucratic practices that were overturned by LSP lawyers. Facing loosened
constraints presumably increased women’s utility, but the ultimate effects of the LSP on children,
for example, remains an ambiguous and open question for future research.

37

Charles and Luoh (2010), for example, conclude that increasing sentences for low-level drug crimes reduced
marriage rates in the 1980s and 1990s by altering sex ratios and bargaining in marriage markets. An implication is
that criminal justice policy affects families. Shenhav (2018) and Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2017) show that strong
labor markets for women relative to men reduce marriage. An implication is that labor market policy affects families.

29

D. What did the LSP mean for people’s well-being?
We cannot draw conclusions about how the changes we document matter for well-being. There
are reasons to believe such changes could have made parents and children worse off. Single parents
cannot “gain from a division of labor between market and household activities” (Becker 1991, p.
3). Single parenthood also “deprives children of important economic, parental, and community
resources” (McLanahan and Sandefur 1994, p. 3) and it is the “strongest correlate of upward
income mobility” across neighborhoods (Chetty et al. 2014). 38
On the other hand, LSPs relaxed poor families’ budget constraints and altered their choices.
Evidence from unilateral divorce reforms, for example, shows that increased access to divorce
raised divorces but reduced female suicide rates (Stevenson and Wolfers 2006) All parties may be
better off if marginal marriages break up. Moreover, easier access to welfare and divorce changed
bargaining within marriages that did not break up, and we cannot measure well-being among these
couples (Lundberg and Pollak 1996). Using the National Crime Victimization Survey from 1992
to 1998, Farmer and Tiefenthaler (2003) find that legal services for victims of domestic violence
has a “significant negative effect on the likelihood that an individual woman is battered.” Lastly,
we do not find any increases in poverty; the cash safety net worked. One way to examine how
LSPs affected well-being among children would be to observe their adult outcomes. We leave this
to future work.

38

Policymakers clearly believe that family structure matters. A planning paper for the White House’s 1966 Civil
Rights conference argued “few would deny that a harmonious two-parent home offers the best prospect for a child to
reach his full potential” (quoted in Rainwater and Yancey 1967, p. 322). Reflecting recently on the War on Poverty,
Robert Rector (2014) blamed “the collapse of marriage in low-income communities” for persistent poverty, and former
House Speaker Paul Ryan (2014, p. 4) argued that the “most important determinant of poverty is family structure.”

30

VII. CONCLUSION
We provide the first evidence on the effect of federally subsidized legal assistance on welfare
receipt and family structure during the 1960s. Our results suggest that improved access to legal
advice and representation increased divorce in the short run and led to a permanent shift up in
welfare receipt, as intended. We also find that the program raised nonmarital births. These changes
in marital status at birth are reflected in a reduction in the probability that mothers lived with the
father of their children between 1960 and 1970. Our findings contribute to debates about why
single parenthood and welfare use increased so sharply in the 1960s, and help reconcile strong
theoretical predictions about welfare and families with typically weak empirical evidence.

Notes: The figure plots the share of mothers in the Census and American Community Survey who are between ages
10 and 44 and who report a marital status other than married. We group married women with an absent spouse with
those divorced and separated because “separated” was only added as a separate category in 1950. In 1930, the last
pre-war Census before “separated” was added to the marital status question, about 2.6 percent of women reported that
they were “married, spouse absent.” In 1950, after “separated” was available, the share was 1.4 percent. The figure
omits widowhood, which fell continuously throughout this period and was essentially the only reported reason for
unmarried motherhood before 1920.

Notes: The dependent variable is the number of divorces that occur in county 𝑐𝑐 and year 𝑡𝑡 divided by the number of
women ages 10–49 measured in thousands. The average dependent variable in treated counties in the year their LSP
starts is 9 divorces per 1,000 women. The figure plots event-study estimates from equation (1) for the inverse
propensity score reweighted specification (black lines with solid circles) and an unweighted specification that controls
for state-by-year and urban-group-by-year fixed effects (gray lines with open squares). We do not observe event-times
before -6 or after +13 for all treated counties. They are included in separate bins and their coefficients are not reported.
Dashed lines are pointwise 95 percent confidence intervals based on standard errors clustered by county. Sample 1
includes 2,683 counties.

Notes: The dependent variable is the number of open AFDC cases in county c and (a given month of) year t divided
by the number of women ages 10–49 measured in thousands. The average dependent variable in treated counties in
the year their LSP starts is 23 cases per 1,000 women. The figure plots event-study estimates from equation (1) for
the inverse propensity score reweighted specification and an unweighted specification that controls for state-by-year
and urban-group-by-year fixed effects. Because data on AFDC cases are not available in every year before 1968 we
group event-study dummies -6 through -3 into one dummy whose coefficient is plotted at -4.5. The omitted category
combines event-times -2 and -1. We do not observe event-times before -6 or after +7 (Sample 2) or +13 (Sample 1)
for all treated counties. They are included in separate bins and their coefficients are not reported. Dashed lines are
pointwise 95 percent confidence intervals based on standard errors clustered by county. Sample 1 includes 2,683
counties and Sample 2 contains 603 counties in SMSAs.

Notes: The dependent variable in Panel A is the number of births in county 𝑐𝑐, year 𝑡𝑡, divided by the number of women
ages 10–49 measured in thousands. The average dependent variable in treated counties in the year their LSP starts is
62.7 births per 1,000 women. The dependent variable in Panel B is the number of marriages that occur in county 𝑐𝑐,
year 𝑡𝑡, divided by the number of resident women ages 10–49 measured in thousands. The average dependent variable
in treated counties in the year their LSP starts is 31.9 marriages per 1,000 women. The figure plots event-study
estimates from equation (1) for the inverse propensity score reweighted specification and an unweighted specification
that controls for state-by-year and urban-group-by-year fixed effects. We do not observe event-times before -6 or after
+13 for all treated counties. They are included in separate bins and their coefficients are not reported. Dashed lines
are pointwise 95 percent confidence intervals based on standard errors clustered by county. These results come from
Sample 1 which includes 2,683 counties.

Notes: The figure plots DD coefficients (from the reweighting estimator) with the outcome variable defined as the
change from 1960–1970 in the county-level probability of having income greater than or equal to the amount on the
x-axis (measured in $2,000 bins in 2017 dollars). For details on “distribution regression” see Chernozhukov,
Fernández-Val, and Melly (2013). This reflects changes in the cumulative distribution of income by source. Sample
5 includes mothers living with their children in the 1960 and 1970 Census in 81 counties identified in both years with
underlying samples of 390,599 mothers in 1960 and 170,941 mothers in 1970. Unearned income equals total individual
income minus earned income (wage, business, and farm income). Other family income equals total family income
minus the mother’s own income. The dotted lines are 95-percent pointwise confidence intervals for the unearned
income results. None of the individual coefficients for other sources of income are statistically significant.

Notes: The dependent variable in Panel A is the ratio of men to women ages 15–34 in county 𝑐𝑐 and year 𝑡𝑡 from Census
population tabulations (Haines and ICPSR 2010). The dependent variable in Panel B is the log of payroll per worker
in county 𝑐𝑐 and year 𝑡𝑡 from County Business Patterns data. Panel A plots event-study estimates from a version of
equation (1) that interacts a dummy for receiving any LSP grant with Census year dummies. Panel B plots event-study
estimates from equation (1). Both panels plot estimates from the inverse propensity score reweighted specification
and an unweighted specification that controls for state-by-year and urban-group-by-year fixed effects. We do not
observe event-times before -3 or after +13 for all treated counties. They are included in separate bins and their
coefficients are not reported. Dashed lines are pointwise 95 percent confidence intervals based on standard errors
clustered by county. These results come from Sample 1 which includes 2,683 counties.

Notes: The table presents estimates from an inverse propensity score reweighted specification and an unweighted

figures by grouping event-times of years -6 to -2, 0 to 5, and 6 to 13. We do not observe event-times before -6 or after
+13 for all treated counties. They are included in separate bins and their coefficients are not reported. Standard errors
clustered by state are in brackets, one-sided p-values for 500 random permutations of the LSP variable are in
parentheses (see Appendix D for permutation distributions). ITT = intention-to-treat.

Notes: To calculate counterfactuals we subtract the event-study estimates from observed outcomes by county and then
multiply by county populations in each year. This yields total numbers of nonmarital births and AFDC cases. The
percentages of counts that LSP can explain differ from the portion of rates that it can explain because of differential
population growth in treated versus untreated counties. Columns (1) and (2) contain totals for treated counties only
and all counties in Sample 2, and columns (3) and (4) contain totals for treated counties only and all counties in Sample
4.

Notes: The table presents estimated effects from the reweighting specification stratified by state policy characteristics. Panels A and B split the sample into states
with no-fault divorces laws in 1970 or earlier (12 states) and those that introduced no-fault divorce after 1970 (37 states). No-fault divorce simplified the legal
process for obtaining a divorce, making it easier for LSP lawyers, for example, to perform divorces (Wolfers 2006). Panels C and D split the sample into states that
had an AFDC-Unemployed Parent (AFDC-UP) program before 1981 (31 states, mostly implemented in the 1960s) and states that introduced AFDC-UP after a
federal mandate in 1981 (18 states). AFDC-UP allowed benefits to be paid to families with both parents present and therefore meant that women need not be
unmarried or non-cohabiting to receive assistance. ITT = intention-to-treat.

Notes: The table presents difference-in-differences estimates using a sample of mothers living in 81 identified counties
in 1960 (390,599 respondents) or 1970 (170,941 respondents). Panel A presents estimates from the fixed effects
specification and Panel B presents reweighted estimates. Because there are so few counties, we use region fixed effects
in Panel A instead of state fixed effects. We collapse the data to county-level changes and estimate a cross-sectional
regression with a dummy for having an LSP by 1970 as the right-hand-side variable of interest. The underlying sample
in column 1 uses all mothers, columns 2–4 use means calculated separately by mother’s education. We recalculate the
propensity score weights using the 1960 Census characteristics from Table 3 and 1960 levels of poverty, single
motherhood, and the age distribution of mothers (in 5-year bins). Standard errors clustered by county are in brackets
and p-values from 500 permutations of the treatment dummy are in parentheses (see Online Appendix E for
permutation distributions).
