    "abstract": "\n\nCompared with China\u2019s pre-eminent status in world trade, its role in global finance is poorly understood. This paper studies the size, characteristics, and determinants of China\u2019s capital exports building a new database of 5000 loans and grants to 152 countries, 1949-2017. We find that 50% of China\u2019s lending to developing countries is not reported to the IMF or World Bank. These \u201chidden debts\u201d distort policy surveillance, risk pricing, and debt sustainability analyses. Since China\u2019s overseas lending is almost entirely official (state-controlled), the standard \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d drivers of private cross-border flows do not apply in the same way.\n\n",
